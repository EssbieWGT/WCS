The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is one of the one of the stocks Jim Cramer was bullish on due to share buyback activity. Cramer said, “we think the world of” the company’s CEO, as he commented:

“Fourth is a bank that I’ve come to like very much over the past couple years, and that’s BNY, the old Bank of New York Mellon. BNY shrunk its share count by 36.2% since the end of 2015, even if the stock wasn’t a real outperformer until more recently. Under CEO Robin Vince, we think the world of him, a Goldman Sachs alum who’s been leading BNY for the past three years or so. The nation’s oldest bank has found new life. They focus on selling their entire suite of financial services to investors rather than marketing this stuff as one-off products. And they’ve also leaned heavily into technology, including AI, maybe the most of all the banks I follow. It’s truly working as the stock’s nearly tripled in a little more than two years.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) provides financial services, including investment management, custody, clearing, and wealth planning. The company also offers banking, trading, and cash management solutions. Cramer mentioned the company during the July 15 episode and remarked:

“This morning, everybody was focused on the numbers from the big banks, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, but they were also watching the report from BNY, and that’s the old Bank of New York Mellon. This is one of the top custodial banks in America. And this morning, BNY reported another strong quarter with easy top and bottom line beats, not to mention a stunning nearly 28% return on something called tangible common equity. That’s one of the best results I’ve ever seen from a bank. BNY even raised its full-year net interest income forecast with the quarter. Very few did that.”

ID32,Nvidia,2025-12-21 15:02:12+00:00,The Motley Fool,1 Big Reason Why Today's Value Investors Won't Find Tomorrow's Nvidia | The Motley Fool,"Jon Quast, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/20/1-big-reason-why-todays-value-investors-wont-find/,"But many value investors would have never invested in Nvidia because they think about value in the wrong way.
Why value investors missed Nvidia Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks.
Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.
Returning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019.
The takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability.","In his 1992 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, said, ""We think the very term 'value investing' is redundant."" In other words, seeking value is the only way to invest. Given Buffett's affinity for value investing and his incredible success over the years, many investors seek to emulate his approach to stocks.

Unfortunately, most value investors miss the forest for the trees. And I'll explain how by using Nvidia (NVDA +3.80%) -- the best-performing large-cap stock of the past decade -- as an example.

Yes, I know it's a cherry-picked example. But many value investors would have never invested in Nvidia because they think about value in the wrong way. It's important to recognize the misconception that holds investors back from life-changing opportunities.

Why value investors missed Nvidia

Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks. And cheapness is measured by comparing the value of the company with something from its financial results, including profits.

Let's say a company is valued at $50 billion and only has $50 million in net income. This stock would be valued at 1,000 times its earnings. In other words, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (a popular valuation metric) would be 1,000. Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.

In 2019, Nvidia's market cap, the value of the company, was around $100 billion. But its average P/E ratio for the year was 35, as the chart below shows.

The average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is somewhere around 25. Anything above that has an above-average valuation and is considered expensive by value investors. Nvidia in 2019, therefore, would have been too pricey to buy.

Value investors believe that the best value stocks to buy trade at a P/E ratio below the average. And often, value investors think that the cheaper a stock is, the better.

However, Nvidia has gone on to outperform virtually every other publicly traded company since the start of 2020, despite having an above-average P/E ratio. In short, value investing, as traditionally approached, prevented some investors from buying one of the greatest stocks of our time.

How to improve the value mindset

There's another important quote from Buffett that needs to be considered here. In the same letter, he wrote, ""Growth is always a component in the calculation of value."" In other words, value investors must look ahead when looking for a bargain.

Herein lies the problem with value investing as it's usually done: The P/E ratio (and others) measures past results. But investors must buy stocks today, looking ahead to what the business results could be tomorrow.

Returning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019. But the P/E ratio didn't reflect the company's superb future earnings growth. As the chart below shows, the stock price is up nearly 3,000% in the last five years, but its earnings per share (EPS) are up even more than that.

Nvidia has earned $100 billion in net income over the past year. The stock traded at 35 times trailing earnings in 2019, which looked expensive. But for those with foresight, the entire value of the company then was equal to its profits right now, which is about as cheap as a stock could possibly be.

On a personal note, I missed Nvidia stock in 2019, not because of its pricey P/E ratio, but rather because I didn't foresee earnings growth of this magnitude. I didn't believe that the current build-out for AI infrastructure would be so big and last for so long. And in a traditionally cyclical space, I worried that overestimating demand would lead to lower margins at Nvidia.

I was dead wrong, and that underscores why investing is hard. Looking at a P/E ratio or a market cap is easy. Predicting where the world is going, how a company is positioned, and what that means financially is a tall order. It's why even the best investors often make mistakes.

The takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability. The best stocks for the next 10 years might not look like value stocks right now. But they will be a tremendous value in hindsight.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F847355%2Fyoung-man-sitting-pensively-at-his-computer-looking-thoughtfully-at-the-screen-in-front-of-him.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-21 11:01:15.684515

“These segments are best suited for electrification because of their economics, limited charging needs and alignment with urban mobility patterns.” In India, electric two-wheelers will remain the backbone of EV adoption due to their affordability and daily-use economics.
“Battery localisation is not just a manufacturing challenge—it is a strategic imperative,” Bharadwaj said.
“Electrification has moved firmly into the mainstream, but battery localisation has not kept pace.
“Whoever cracks scale, cost efficiency and supply resilience in batteries will define the next phase of EV leadership in India,” Bharadwaj said.","Electric two-wheelers will continue to anchor electric vehicle (EV) adoption in India, while passenger cars are set to emerge as the fastest-growing segment from 2026, according to a recent assessment by Capgemini. The consulting firm said strong total cost of ownership benefits, improving charging access and rapid digitisation of vehicles will drive the next phase of EV growth across regions and city tiers.

“Globally, passenger cars will still dominate EV volumes, but in markets like India the deepest penetration will come from two- and three-wheelers and last-mile commercial vehicles,” said Anuraag Bharadwaj, Industry Platform Leader for Automotive – India at Capgemini. “These segments are best suited for electrification because of their economics, limited charging needs and alignment with urban mobility patterns.”

In India, electric two-wheelers will remain the backbone of EV adoption due to their affordability and daily-use economics. At the same time, passenger EVs are expected to see sharp year-on-year growth as charging infrastructure expands and product options widen across cities.

Beyond the Sale

Technology is also reshaping the two-wheeler segment. Digital display clusters are increasingly mirroring car infotainment systems, offering connected features such as navigation, diagnostics and content playback. Alongside this, software-defined vehicles (SDVs) are beginning to alter OEM business models in India. “OEMs are clearly looking beyond one-time vehicle sales,” Bharadwaj said. “Subscriptions, connected services and feature-led monetisation will become increasingly important revenue streams as consumers become more value-conscious.”

Profitability Gap

However, even as adoption accelerates, Capgemini cautioned that EV profitability in India remains constrained by weak battery localisation. Batteries account for nearly 40% of an EV’s total cost, making them the most expensive component. While localisation has improved in vehicle assembly and electronics integration, domestic battery cell manufacturing remains limited, forcing automakers to rely on imports from China and other markets.

“Battery localisation is not just a manufacturing challenge—it is a strategic imperative,” Bharadwaj said. “Electrification has moved firmly into the mainstream, but battery localisation has not kept pace. Without a strong domestic ecosystem for cell manufacturing and raw material processing, EV profitability in India will remain structurally constrained.” In the interim, mainstream automakers such as Mahindra are sourcing advanced battery technologies like Blade cells from BYD, a configuration expected in upcoming models including the Maruti eVitara and the Toyota Urban Cruiser EV.

Government incentives under the Production Linked Incentive scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell batteries have triggered gigafactory announcements, but Capgemini said their impact on vehicle costs will be felt only over the medium term. “Whoever cracks scale, cost efficiency and supply resilience in batteries will define the next phase of EV leadership in India,” Bharadwaj said.",https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/12/capgemini.reuters_20250918174936_20251218154439_20251221142311.jpg?quality=100,N,,2025-12-21 11:00:59.375773

What Walled Gardens Look Like in 3D Printing The 3D printing walled garden is the hardware, firmware, cloud slicer, material profiles, model repositories, and support resources, among other elements.
Privacy issues are a real concern in a world increasingly reliant on 3D printers for manufacturing, and studies have shown that IP theft is a significant risk in 3D printing.
A Buyer’s Guide to Walled Gardens in 3D Printing Which Printers Are 'Open' and Which Are 'Closed'?
3D printing is going mainstream, and mainstream means “make it easy.” Easy usually comes with walls.","Remember when desktop 3D printing felt like the Wild West? A decade ago, anyone with a printer, some filament, and a free weekend could grab models from Thingiverse, tweak a few slicer settings, and let the machine run overnight. The process—and the prints that resulted from it—were chaotic, messy, and often frustrating, but it was also…fun? It felt like the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine, and it was, arguably, glorious.

That free-for-all experimentation era is fading fast, though. In its place? Carefully curated, tightly controlled “walled gardens” where companies make not only the hardware but also the software, the consumables, and the very marketplace where files are shared. It’s the iOS ecosystem, but for 3D printers. And the kicker? While there are protests from the edges, for the most part, it actually works, and people are growing to love it.

Keep Them Coming Back for More

When I was a young engineer starting out, I worked for an automated machinery company that serviced the sewing goods industry. Sewing machines have hundreds of moving parts, and they wear out over time. My employer took me aside once and showed me one of those parts in a spare bin. He rolled it in his hand like a poker chip. The tone in his voice grew somber as he said to me, “See this plate? This costs us $15 to import. We sell it for $400. It wears out, on average, every 4 to 6 months. Always remember: Whenever possible, sell the stapler and the staples.”

He explained to me that for the business to continue running—and to grow and keep everyone employed—the initial purchase of the machinery couldn’t be a customer's only purchase. Parts and supplies like these, with incredibly high markups, were what kept the lights on. A customer who bought a machine from us could spend upward of five to 10 times more than the cost of the machine itself over its lifespan.

Fast-forward to now. I'm no longer hawking sewing machine parts. Instead, I'm writing this story in my home office, where I tinker with and test all sorts of gadgets, including 3D printers. The office is filled with not just printers, but also filament, resin, and spare parts: ""staples,"" from floor to ceiling. Plenty of other hobbyists' and entrepreneurs' home offices look just like mine, which makes you quickly realize the oodles of cash that are up for grabs selling 3D printing accessories.

So it's only natural that the walled gardens of 3D printing are growing taller, as the big players have emerged and dug in. Depending on where you stand, that’s either a long-overdue correction or the beginning of a slow suffocation. A feature, or a fetter.

What Walled Gardens Look Like in 3D Printing

The 3D printing walled garden is the hardware, firmware, cloud slicer, material profiles, model repositories, and support resources, among other elements. If you want to print, you’re encouraged—and sometimes forced—to use only what the company that made your printer sells. This is happening in two universes at the moment: The consumer side, which is what we mostly cover at PCMag, and the professional side, where many American and European companies have found respite from Chinese competitors for the time being.

Compare that to the “open” 3D printing world that I, along with many other pioneering hobbyists, grew up in, and which still exists but is fading rapidly. In that world, you can download models from a dozen free sites, slice them in Cura or PrusaSlicer, and run whatever filament happens to be on sale this week. Need a new gasket for a DIY repair, perhaps? Don't order it from Amazon or even McMaster-Carr. Just print your own on an open-source printer. It’s cheaper, but it’s also messier and more time-consuming.

This phenomenon isn't novel, of course. Printer—paper printer—manufacturers have been pulling this trick for decades by making proprietary ink cartridges. A decade ago, HP tried to block the use of third-party ink via firmware, making you fear bricking your own printer if you tried to use another vendor’s ink. (HP later abandoned this effort, at least in part.) Apple’s App Store lives on the same principle. I can’t share songs I purchase on my Android phone with my wife, who is browsing the iTunes store next to me as I write this.

The difference, though, is that in 3D printing, the stakes involve not just money but reliability, safety, and speed—things that can make or break a newbie’s first impression.

Why Companies Are Raising the Walls

If you’re wondering why companies are doubling down on lock-ins and gathering as many customers as they can into their respective gardens, the answer is simple: control.

Support Costs Drop When You Control Every Variable

Think about it from the company's perspective: Fewer random filaments means fewer angry customers sending failed print photos to your support team—the “Why is this piece of junk not working?” tickets. It also means fewer nozzles you have to ship out, at your cost, to keep their flaming fingers out of the forums and Facebook groups long enough to get them past the jam they caused with bargain-basement filament.

Safety Improves When Resins and Filaments Are Vetted

Fewer toxic fumes mean fewer mechanical misfires. Formlabs, maker of the Form 4 I recently reviewed, claims to have eliminated the dangerous VOCs found in many resins and uses ISO certification in its resins and other ancillary products to maintain consistency. The Form 4 is therefore a favorite of pros who know exactly why things like tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation, and heat deflection are critical.

Performance Is More Consistent

Tuned profiles mean smoother prints and fewer headaches. When I was coming up in the hobby, it was assumed that you were always tweaking and adjusting; printing calibration cubes, Benchies, and temperature towers. If you didn’t know how to do those things, you were a newbie to be pitied, and most of your prints probably failed.

Those days are long gone. I recently tested the Bambu Lab H2S, which not only comes with pre-tuned slicer settings for every Bambu Lab filament but also includes equivalent settings for nearly every major filament supplier. I tested both, with flawless results and no tuning or futzing required.

Recurring Revenue From Accessories Keeps the Lights On

Printers are often sold at razor-thin margins; filament and resin make up the difference. Here's some napkin math: Assuming we’re talking about a larger brand, the gross margin on filament sales is somewhere between 40% and 70%. The net margin on 3D printers, on the other hand (after all costs and overhead), is maybe 20% or 25%. When you buy a $1,500 printer, the company makes $300 in profits. Assuming you use 50 spools of filament a year per printer, that’s another $500 per year for the life of the machine. Keeping you in the garden is good for business.

Data Loops Build Better Machines

Telemetry on what succeeds and fails feeds back into better slicers, better defaults, and tighter ecosystems. Web-connected slicers like Bambu Studio bring files offsite to a cloud server and back again, which has me concerned about possible IP theft, but let's face it: If Bambu Lab knows all about the file you were printing in a machine that can measure (via cameras and sensors) how the print went, it can learn from failed prints. Tesla monitors all the data from cars using its Full Self-Driving feature to improve the AI that makes driving decisions, and 3D printer companies can take a similar approach. Instead of telemetry data and speeds, it’s g-code and video. No one I’ve ever met who owns a Tesla is mad that their driving data goes back to the corporation, because they know it’s improving their experience. Data loops within the walled garden perform the same function.

If you were raised like me, printing your 3D bits from USB keys instead of via a web app, this can be a hard leap to make. But let's not forget that life outside the garden isn't free from data-sharing pitfalls, either. In 2021, a Thingiverse data breach potentially exposed data from hundreds of thousands of users.

The Upside for Users

Let’s be honest: most people don’t want to fiddle with firmware, PID tuning, or slicer voodoo. They want the print to work the first time. Walled gardens are delivering that in spades. People are loyal to their brands as a result, with the term “fanboy” tossed around more frequently than ever. If you are a Prusa, Bambu Lab, or Creality convert, you know that the energy in those forums is akin to football fans arguing over which team is going to win the Super Bowl this year. And fandom has its concrete benefits.

First-Print Success Rates Skyrocket

A beginner can unbox, click Print, and hold a finished part hours later. I’ve met people who’ve never had a first-layer issue, while back in the day, I would spend hours fighting with my Creality Ender 3, invoking all sorts of remedies, including hairspray, glue sticks, and prayers to whatever deity was listening, to get to the second layer.

Time Savings Are Real

No more spending 3 hours browsing a forum thread to fix a stringing issue: The maker world moves faster than it ever has. I met three vendors at a maker festival in September who cumulatively had about 500 articulated figurines for sale: $5 for three. These people earn their living from these fairs and don’t have time to spare fixing things.

Quality Is Better

Tuned profiles and real-time monitoring reduce the likelihood of failure. I recently had a client come to me asking to reverse-engineer the transparent dome light on his cooking range. The manufacturer didn’t make replacement parts, and so I scanned it and printed it with the Form 4 using Formlabs' Transparent V3 resin, which I know to be dimensionally accurate. The part measured 2.95 inches wide (75.05mm, to be exact), and it was a perfect fit.

I happily pay more for the resin, knowing I can take on those types of jobs and produce an engineered replacement that measures up to what I designed in my CAD software. There's no Wild West aspect, so the experience isn't a nail-biter, but I get great prints with pre-tuned dimensional accuracy.

Safety

Certified materials and built-in interlocks aren’t just marketing; they prevent accidents. When I load the 10-watt laser module into the Bambu Lab H2S and go to cut a part from 3mm-thick birchboard, there’s a QR code sticker in the corner that tells the cutter exactly what material I’m using. It knows what power levels to use and how fast to move the laser through the wood—all the things it needs to avoid setting the board on fire and burning my house down. I trust that over my late-night intuition just before I go to bed, with best guesses driving my g-code. I’ll pay more for that, as will most people, especially when I first start working with new materials I’m unfamiliar with.

The Downsides

Of course, just like an actual wall, the walled-garden approach has multiple sides, and there are plenty of negative ones.

Costs Creep Upward

Proprietary filaments and resins cost more, and some companies use DRM chips to prevent you from using third-party resin. It can get even more extreme than that: The Form 4 and other Formlabs printers prevent owners from using whatever resin they want in their machines unless they pay hefty unlocking fees.

Innovation Slows

When companies dictate what’s allowed, experimental materials and techniques get buried. Once a company can build a large enough user base, it controls the pace of development, as opposed to the early days when innovation leaps were required to punch through into the market.

It takes a ""black swan"" innovator to force everyone with a walled garden to catch up quickly. I believe we’re seeing this now with Snapmaker’s U1 multi-toolhead printer, which has raised more than $20.6 million on Kickstarter at this writing. Bambu Lab is now attempting to compete with its upcoming Vortek tool-changing accessory.

Marketplaces Gatekeep

File visibility isn’t always merit-based; it’s algorithmic. That means the best designs don’t always win—the best thumbnails do. When you control the keys to the kingdom, you control what files people are potentially printing on your machines.

Data Is Extracted

Every print you slice in the cloud reveals information about you, your projects, and your habits to the vendor. Privacy issues are a real concern in a world increasingly reliant on 3D printers for manufacturing, and studies have shown that IP theft is a significant risk in 3D printing. The larger the garden and the more dependent users are on it compounds the possibility of theft or hacking. There’s a tremendous element of trust involved.

Longevity Questions Loom

What happens if the company shuts down its servers or moves on from your model of printer? Suddenly, your “ecosystem” is a paperweight. This has plenty of precedent, too: Google recently discontinued the smart features of older Nest thermostats.

The only company currently providing a robust path forward for upgrades is Prusa, which is arguably being left behind in terms of features as a result. While you can turn a Prusa MK3 or MK4 into a Core One, the Core One simply doesn’t compare to an H2D or H2S, Bambu Lab’s latest models.

A Buyer’s Guide to Walled Gardens in 3D Printing

Which Printers Are 'Open' and Which Are 'Closed'?

Prusa printers are arguably the most un-walled mainstream printers out there. The company's Printables is free and open-source, though it lacks the same monetized incentive structure of Bambu Lab's MakerWorld.

Formlabs is mostly closed. Its resin and software ecosystem is locked tight, but its users largely accept it because the quality is unmatched, with dimensionally tuned and accurate outputs. Want your parts to fit together properly? You need Formlabs resin.

Stratasys has always been closed. For enterprise buyers, that’s the point: certifications, compliance, security, and contracts matter more than tinkering. Like Formlabs, Stratasys—and subsidiaries like Ultimaker—have largely retreated to the educational and professional space, with a dwindling number of consumer models available.

Elegoo, Anycubic, Qidi, and Creality occupy a fuzzier space. They've largely been open, but are moving toward curated slicers and marketplaces. Everyone sees where the market is headed, and no one wants to be left behind. Each of these companies has its own filament and resin lines, with virtually every possible color and polymer available, and “pre-tuned” slicer settings in Cura or Orca to get you started quickly without fiddling.

So, should you buy into one of these gardens? It depends on what you want.

If you prioritize reliability, enter the garden. You’ll spend more, but you’ll save time and frustration. If someone were to ask me what a good first 3D printer to buy is, and I wanted them to have the easiest setup and most enjoyable experience, I would drop them off from a theoretical helicopter directly into the middle of Bambu Lab’s garden.

If you love tinkering, stay outside. Cheap filament, third-party slicers, wild mods—the Wild West is disappearing, but it's not gone. If I were on a spaceship that needed to survive a 100-year mission, I would bring a Prusa with me, along with 10,000 rolls of Prusament. Blessed are the tinkerers, and they all wear black-and-orange shirts.

If you have the space and budget for two printers, buy one of each. Use the polished ecosystem for mission-critical prints, and reserve the tinkerer’s machine for experiments with unconventional filaments and techniques. My LulzBot TAZ 5 has been printing for 10 years now. I can put any filament I want into it (I create a makeshift heated chamber by throwing an emergency blanket over it) and keep the earliest phases of my IP private in my office. Just keep your eyes open for red flags: consumables with DRM, printers that function only via cloud slicing, or companies with a history of abandoning products.

What Will the Walled Garden of the Future Bring?

I’d bet on more walls, not fewer. Expect:

Creator subscriptions and “pro” packs. This seems inevitable to me. Platforms like MakerWorld will become more like Spotify, and designers will rise as a result.

Smarter, telemetry-driven auto-profiles. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, it’s hard to envision a world where it isn’t embedded in a machine's ROM to monitor prints via sensors and cameras.

Partially walled gardens, in which vendors still allow escape hatches but prefer you don’t use them. Bambu Lab and Formlabs provide exit hatches for third-party filaments and resins, and I suppose see the necessity of a door in and out of the garden.

Lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny. If it’s illegal for HP to stop people from loading third-party ink cartridges, as some customers have (so far unsuccessfully) argued in court, it’s inevitable that regulation will catch up to what is arguably an analogous situation with 3D printers.

(Credit: Michael Lydick)

The genie’s out of the bottle. 3D printing is going mainstream, and mainstream means “make it easy.” Easy usually comes with walls. The walled gardens of 3D printing aren’t inherently evil. In many cases, they make the tech more reliable, safer, and far more approachable for the average hobbyist. Without them, adoption would stall.

But make no mistake: Every convenience comes at a cost. If you step into a garden, know the price of admission, and know that the gate may not always stay open. The best gardens don’t just protect the company—they protect the users and the creators, too.

If vendors get that balance right, maybe a wall doesn’t have to feel like a prison. Maybe it can feel like an amusement park—curated, safe, and pleasant, but just exciting enough to be worth wandering into.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05w23Zdc93miv2kx7tU2mqh-7.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1766003609.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 08:59:52.091490

While the headlines point to a bleak midwinter for the UK economy, if you apply enough festive cheer it is just about possible to imagine a better 2026.","Stalling growth, sticky inflation and fragile bond markets, the UK’s economic record in 2025 has hardly been one to inspire cheer. But in the spirit of the festive season, here are a few reasons to hope for a happier new year.

The first is that, barring external forces, 2026 should not involve a repeat of this year’s fiscal drama.

Rachel Reeves more than doubled the margin of error, or headroom, against her fiscal rules at last month’s budget, and that should gift the Treasury a quieter 2026.

The chancellor’s spring statement should be a non-event for another reason, too: she announced that while the Office for Budget Responsibility will still carry out a forecast, it will not formally assess her against the rules.

So as some wise men – and women – advised her to do last year, even if there has been a marked deterioration in the outlook, Reeves intends to stand firm until the autumn budget. That would mark a welcome contrast with the tax and spend saga of the past year (though if Labour MPs choose to change the top team in Downing Street, the drama would be very much back on).

A second reason for optimism is that after a gloomy year, recent surveys have included glimmers of hope.

Official figures show Britain’s economy unexpectedly shrank in October. But the snapshot is backward-looking, assessing how activity had fared through the rear-view mirror. The latest flash purchasing managers index for December, published by data provider S&P Global, suggests things could be improving. The reading on its monthly index jumped to 52.1, from 51.2 in November – with 50 marking the divide between growth and contraction.

In the private sector, S&P said, “the rise in new business was the strongest for 14 months and mainly reflected a solid improvement in demand across the service economy”.

It would make sense that if, as many business groups have claimed, the chaotic budget buildup killed confidence, we should get a modest uptick in activity now that it is over.

Neil Carberry, the chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, says that chimes with what he is hearing from member companies.

“There was a general sense that things got quite a lot better from the first week of September, and October, then the brakes went on a little bit in November, because of pre-budget chat.”

He adds: “[Hiring] won’t come back this month because it’s December, but quite a few people are quite hopeful about what comes through in January and February.”

A third source of optimism is the hope that consumers could respond positively to the latest Bank of England rate cut, the government’s £150-a-year energy bills relief package, and an end to months of tedious speculation over tax.

There are plenty of reasons for caution here. Not least a reluctance at the Bank to cut rates much further, despite weakness in the labour market.

But if cheaper mortgages and energy bills do help to ease the squeeze, and – whisper it – restore a bit of feelgood factor, the evidence suggests some consumers could have some financial capacity to respond.

The household savings rate – the share of income workers put away for a rainy day – has jumped to well above the long-run average since the Covid pandemic. In the second quarter of this year, it was running at 10.7% – about 2.5 percentage points higher than the 1987-2019 average.

Analysis by Michael Saunders, a former Bank rate setter, now of the consultancy Oxford Economics, suggests a heightened sense of financial insecurity is one explanation. After the jarring shock of Covid shutdowns, the energy price spike, and soaring interest rates, that would make sense.

He is concerned this higher propensity to save could “cap consumer spending growth” for some time to come, dampening the economic recovery. But viewed in a festive spirit of optimism, it does indicate a capacity for some households to loosen their belts a little, if the mood should take them.

The fourth reason for hope is even more tentative, but potentially significant: recent productivity data has been improving.

In what Andrew Wishart of Berenberg bank called recently “the good news story of the year”, the key measure of economic output per worker (vital for lifting wages and living standards) rose by 1% in the first half of 2025. This puts productivity “on course to record one of its better years since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009”.

In some labour-intensive sectors, where there have been job cuts following Reeves’s changes to employer national insurance contributions (NICs), that is little more than a mathematical effect – fewer workers for a given level of GDP means more output per worker.

But Wishart’s early analysis also suggests productivity gains in other sectors, including IT. “We could plausibly be witnessing the beginnings of a boost from artificial intelligence,” he argues.

As Reeves’s former chief economic adviser, the London School of Economics academic John Van Reenen has long argued, UK businesses have tended to underinvest in technology and innovation, leaning instead on the plentiful supply of cheap workers.

Part of the largely unspoken logic of raising the minimum wage and employer NICs – which drove up the cost of hiring – was to tip the balance towards productivity-enhancing investment and innovation, which should be good for growth. Much, though, depends on the labour market’s capacity to re-absorb the workers laid-off in the process.

Lower interest rates from the Bank would help here, plus there are some indications that wage inflation is falling away. That could perhaps open the door to more rapid reductions.

While the headlines point to a bleak midwinter for the UK economy, if you apply enough festive cheer it is just about possible to imagine a better 2026.

Parker-Hannifin Investment Narrative Recap

To own Parker Hannifin, you need to believe it can keep compounding earnings through a mix of industrial recovery, aerospace strength and disciplined capital allocation, even as growth expectations moderate.

Against this backdrop, the board’s decision to lift the quarterly dividend by 10% to US$1.80 per share in April 2025 and then maintain that level through late 2025 stands out as an important signal about cash generation and balance sheet comfort. For investors watching analyst optimism, those steady payout decisions help frame whether the current earnings and margin momentum can support both shareholder returns and the higher valuation the stock now carries.

Yet, even with this supportive backdrop, investors should be aware that Parker Hannifin’s increasing reliance on aerospace and longer cycle defense revenue could...

Four fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$668 to US$908, showing how far apart individual views on Parker Hannifin can sit.

""While technology continues to evolve, it cannot replace plumbers, electricians, construction workers, maintenance and repair pros, or other tradespeople,"" said Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of Lowe's.
Walmart revamped its training program in the spring of 2024, focusing on its own workers with a tuition-free training initiative in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
As of mid-November, almost 400 employees had graduated from the program, Walmart said.
Walmart said its goal is to put 4,000 workers through the training program by 2030.","BENTONVILLE, Ark. -- As the number of skilled tradespeople dwindles in the United States, Walmart is trying to build up its own workforce to keep conveyor belts moving, refrigerated grocery cases cold, and drains and parking lots flowing.

The nation's largest retailer and private employer revamped its training program last year to increase the pipeline of maintenance technicians who do everything from repair equipment to electrical work at Walmart's distribution centers and stores -- jobs that have become increasingly difficult to fill because of a shrinking labor pool.

The shortage has opened opportunities for people like Liz Cardenas, 24, who started at Walmart in May 2023 as an automation equipment operator at a distribution center in Lancaster, Texas, making sure boxes were securely taped and went through a conveyer belt upright. Today, she is responsible for fixing conveyor belts and other equipment when they break at distribution centers.

Cardenas, who nearly doubled her hourly pay to $43.50 per hour, said she plans to pursue more training, which will mean an even higher salary and more responsibility. It also means financial freedom.

""I was able to move out of my parents' house,"" she said. ""I have my own apartment. I was able to get a car, and and I'm able to give more to my 401(k).""

A surge of retirements, along with a slowdown in immigration that began during the pandemic but now is accelerating with President Donald Trump's aggressive deportations, are among the main factors behind labor shortages that bedevil some employers, analysts say.

But in skilled trades, the problem is even more acute. Consulting firm McKinsey analyzed 12 types of trade job categories, including maintenance technicians, welders, and carpenters, and predicted an estimated imbalance of 20 job openings for every one net new employee from 2022 to 2032.

McKinsey noted ""the extraordinary rate of churn"" could cost companies more than $5.3 billion every year in talent acquisition and training costs alone.

The shortages are happening as some companies are also laying off workers amid rising operational costs from new tariffs, shifting consumer spending and increased spending on artificial intelligence.

Business Roundtable, a lobbying group of CEOs from roughly 150 companies representing millions of employees nationwide, launched in June a new initiative to address worker shortages in skilled trades, including maintenance technicians. The initiative, co-championed by home improvement retailer Lowe's, entails working with elementary, middle and high schools to raise awareness.

""While technology continues to evolve, it cannot replace plumbers, electricians, construction workers, maintenance and repair pros, or other tradespeople,"" said Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of Lowe's.

For its part, Lowe's in 2022 started a 90-day online training program for employees who want to pursue jobs like carpentry and utility maintenance. Separately, its charitable arm has invested $43 million since 2023 to 60 organizations including technical colleges and non-profit groups to help recruit and train skilled tradespeople like maintenance technicians and plumbers.

Mervin Jebaraj of the University of Arkansas's Walton College of Business in Fayetteville, Arkansas, noted these programs will help ease the shortages, but they won't eliminate the gap, particularly given Trump's clampdown on immigration.

""For as long as somebody physically needs to fix this, the shortage will persist, even though on the margins it'll mitigate some of the shortage,"" he said. ""We don't have enough people.""

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon recently told The Associated Press he believes part of the reason for the shortages is ""lack of awareness.""

""I think most Americans probably don't know what a tech makes that helps take care of our stores and clubs and that we can help them learn how to be a tech,"" he said. ""So we have a need to get the word out so that people know there are some great jobs.""

Walmart revamped its training program in the spring of 2024, focusing on its own workers with a tuition-free training initiative in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. This year, it added new training sites in Vincennes, Indiana, and Jacksonville, Florida. The initiative combines hands-on instruction and classroom learning in fields like heating, ventilation, air conditioning, electrical work, and general maintenance.

As of mid-November, almost 400 employees had graduated from the program, Walmart said. With its first class of 108 associates who completed the Dallas/Fort Worth pilot program, every graduate secured a technician role, putting them on a path to earn an average of $32 per hour. Walmart said its goal is to put 4,000 workers through the training program by 2030.

R.J. Zanes, vice president of facility services for the U.S. divisions of Walmart and Sam's Club, said Walmart was able to attract workers from all over the country with different backgrounds, including employees running cash registers.

Maintenance technician roles are crucial to keeping Walmart's operations running smoothly, but especially so during the holiday season. For example, if a refrigeration system goes down within a Walmart store, it could cost up to $300,000 to $400,000 worth of lost product, according to Zanes.

""We've got to stay out in front of that,"" he said. ""We have to ensure that we've got the right skills there to do preventative maintenance, and when we do have a breakdown, to make sure that we get it back up as fast as possible to minimize that cost of downtime.""",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/imports/adg/photos/211816062_211816062-a2007b0fbd79460395fc47bc9686049a_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-12-21 06:59:43.031371

The mood is cautiously optimistic: the bulls still control the longer term trend, but the latest sessions show a market that is far more selective and sensitive to every new data point.

Live updates, products and investor resources on Adobe Inc. stock

One-Year Investment Performance

An investor who bought Adobe Inc. stock roughly a year ago and simply held on would today be sitting on an impressive gain, in the region of 25 to 35 percent depending on the exact entry point. That outperformance towers over the broader market and highlights how decisively the company has convinced Wall Street that its AI push and subscription engine can keep delivering double digit earnings growth. Yet that very success now fuels the main risk: sentiment has swung from skepticism to high expectations, which leaves less room for error if growth even slightly disappoints.

Recent Catalysts and News

Earlier this week, traders continued to digest Adobe’s most recent earnings update, where the company once again demonstrated resilient demand in its core Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses. Management leaned heavily into the narrative that Firefly and other AI features are already driving higher engagement and willing-to-pay among professional users, a message that resonated with growth-focused investors.

Over the past several days, commentary has also circled back to competitive pressure from both traditional rivals and new AI-native tools, particularly those from big tech platforms and upstart design apps. While there have been no shocking negative headlines, the market has treated even small hints of pricing scrutiny or slower enterprise deal cycles as a reason to lock in profits, contributing to a choppy, consolidation-style trading pattern following the earlier surge.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Wall Street research desks remain broadly constructive on Adobe. Analysts at major houses such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs still frame the shares as a Buy, with price targets that typically imply upside in the low double digits from current levels. Others, including more valuation-focused firms like Bank of America and JPMorgan, have tended toward a more balanced stance, often at Overweight or Neutral, arguing that while the long term AI monetization story is compelling, the stock already discounts much of that growth. Taken together, the consensus skews positive but not euphoric: Adobe is widely viewed as a core quality holding in software, yet its premium multiple leaves little tolerance for execution missteps.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Adobe’s business model rests on deeply embedded creative and document software, sold almost entirely via recurring cloud subscriptions and increasingly enhanced with proprietary generative AI. The company’s next leg of performance will depend on three levers: how convincingly it can upsell AI features across its large installed base, whether it can maintain pricing power in the face of new low cost rivals, and how effectively it expands deeper into marketing and experience software for large enterprises. If management executes on that strategy and macro conditions remain stable, the stock has room to grind higher from consolidation, but any sign that AI monetization is slower than promised could quickly shift today’s cautious optimism back toward a more critical, valuation-driven reset.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405044_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 09:59:41.614629

A series of images shared on X highlighted how the SHANTI Bill 2025 promotes greater international cooperation by strengthening India's commitment to global best practices and international commitments, and by opening doors to developing reactors through international cooperation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said that the passing of the SHANTI Bill by both Houses of Parliament marks a transformational moment for India's technology landscape and delivers a decisive boost to a clean-energy future for the country.

In a post on X, PM Modi said the bill also opens numerous opportunities for the private sector and our youth.

Parliament on Thursday passed the Sustainable Harnessing and Advancement of Nuclear Energy for Transforming India Bill, 2025 (SHANTI Bill).The Bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha a day after it got approval in the Lok Sabha.

In his reply to the debate, Science and Technology Minister Jitendra Singh sought to allay opposition members' apprehensions and said the safety aspect has not been diluted.

The bill seeks to repeal the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 and the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, 2010.

Jitendra Singh said the new legislation is aligned to achieve the objectives of increasing the share of nuclear energy in the total energy mix of India, will facilitate innovation in atomic science and technology, expand its applications to non-power applications and continue to honour India's obligations towards safety, security, safeguards and towards nuclear liability.

India has set an ambitious target to achieve energy independence, with a roadmap to decarbonise the economy by 2070 and to reach 100 gigawatts of nuclear power capacity by 2047.

The bill seeks to leverage the contribution of domestic nuclear energy to augment the global nuclear energy ecosystem.

Opposition members strongly demanded that the bill be referred to the standing or select committee, noting that it has wide-ranging implications and will have a lasting impact. They alleged that the government had diluted the liability clause and asked whether it was bringing the bill under any pressure. The amendments moved by the opposition members were negatived.

It went so 'wild' that the Nvidia CEO had to issue a clarification. During a fireside chat at the Center for Strategic and International Studies this month, Huang directly spoke about his statement on Chinese AI dominance vs America's. CSIS President John Hamre asked Huang what he termed ""very provocative"": You said something recently that was quite provocative. You said that China was winning the AI race, the AI competition. I know that you've got a powerful competitor in Huawei, and Huawei has a lot of advantages you don't have. Why don't you describe this competition? Are we really losing? In his reply to Hamre, Huang said, ""And it apparently caught a lot of attention. As you know with headlines, the disclaimer part, the foundation part was left out of the headline. But the way to think about that is that let me just handicap it right now. If you look at AI and go back to the first thing that we said, AI is a five layer cake. Let's just always simplify it. It's not quite this simplistic, but let's simplify AI into a five layer cake. Energy, chips, infrastructure, models, and applications. And let's handicap it from bottom to top. At the lowest level, China has twice the amount of energy we have as a nation.""

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

China dominance in Energy is one of the 'deal breakers'

""Twice as much energy as we have as a nation. And our economy's larger than theirs. Makes no sense to me. We also know that one of the most important initiatives, one of the most important policies of this administration. And there was the first thing that President Trump said to me when we met: ""Listen, we need to reindustrialize America. We need to do onshore manufacturing again. We need to help America make things again. "" It's going to create jobs. That part of the economy has been offshore and completely gutted the United States. We need to bring that back and he needs my help to do so. And so, that entire sector of the economy is missing,"" Nvidia CEO went on to add. Then Huang added the energy problem that America is facing, where China is miles ahead. While talking about the same Huang did give a compliment to President Trump, saying that he is trying his best to solve the problem. ""And however, without energy, how do we build chip plants, computer system plants, and these AI data centers? We call them AI factories. We're simultaneously building three different types of factories in the United States. Chip factories, super computer factories, and AI factories, they all require energy, every single one of them. And so on, the one hand, we want to reindustrialize the United States. How do you do that without energy? And so, the fact that we vilified energy for so long, President Trump sticking his neck out, and taking it on the chin, and helping the country realize that energy is necessary for our growth, is really one of the greatest things he's done right off the bat,"" Huang said.

America is generations ahead in Chips

He said that while America is 50% of China in energy, the country is generationals ahead in Chips. But at the same time warned that the country cannot afford to be complacent. As semiconductors is a manufacturing process and anybody who thinks China can't manufacture is missing a big idea. ""And so, now at the energy level, back to that stack, we're 50% and they're growing straight up. We're kind of flat right now. And so, number one, energy. Number two, chips. We're generations ahead. We are generations ahead on chips, and I think everybody recognizes that. Number three, infrastructure. If you want to build a data center here in the United States, from breaking ground to standing up an AI supercomputer is probably about three years. They can build a hospital on a weekend. That's a real challenge. And so, at the infrastructure layer, their velocity of building things, because they are builders. Their velocity of building things is extraordinarily high. Now, really quickly on chips. We're several generations ahead, but don't be complacent. Remember, semiconductors are a manufacturing process. Anybody who thinks China can't manufacture is missing a big idea,"" Hunag said.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's ‘China will win the AI race’ remark

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly told the Financial Times in November this year that “China is going to win the AI race,” only to release a clarification statement soon after. Huang was speaking on the sidelines of the FT’s Future of AI Summit, where he warned that China would beat the US in artificial intelligence thanks to lower energy costs and looser regulations. However, several hours after the FT published its report, Nvidia issued a separate statement from Jensen on an official X account. “As I have long said, China is nanoseconds behind America in AI. It’s vital that America wins by racing ahead and winning developers worldwide,” he added.

In the 2010s, tech companies chased staff-level specialists: Backend engineers, data scientists, system architects. That model worked when technology evolved slowly. Specialists knew their craft, could deliver quickly and built careers on predictable foundations like cloud infrastructure or the latest JS framework

Then AI went mainstream.

The pace of change has exploded. New technologies appear and mature in less than a year. You can’t hire someone who has been building AI agents for five years, as the technology hasn’t existed for that long. The people thriving today aren’t those with the longest résumés; they’re the ones who learn fast, adapt fast and act without waiting for direction. Nowhere is this transformation more evident than in software engineering, which has likely experienced the most dramatic shift of all, evolving faster than almost any other field of work.

How AI Is rewriting the rules

AI has lowered the barrier to doing complex technical work, technical skills and it's also raised expectations for what counts as real expertise. McKinsey estimates that by 2030, up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated and 12 million workers may need to shift roles entirely. Technical depth still matters, but AI favors people who can figure things out as they go.

At my company, I see this every day. Engineers who never touched front-end code are now building UIs, while front-end developers are moving into back-end work. The technology keeps getting easier to use but the problems are harder because they span more disciplines.

In that kind of environment, being great at one thing isn’t enough. What matters is the ability to bridge engineering, product and operations to make good decisions quickly, even with imperfect information.

Despite all the excitement, only 1% of companies consider themselves truly mature in how they use AI. Many still rely on structures built for a slower era — layers of approval, rigid roles and an overreliance on specialists who can’t move outside their lane.

The traits of a strong generalist

A strong generalist has breadth without losing depth. They go deep in one or two domains but stay fluent across many. As David Epstein puts it in Range, “You have people walking around with all the knowledge of humanity on their phone, but they have no idea how to integrate it. We don’t train people in thinking or reasoning.” True expertise comes from connecting the dots, not just collecting information.

The best generalists share these traits:

Ownership: End-to-end accountability for outcomes, not just tasks.

First-principles thinking: Question assumptions, focus on the goal, and rebuild when needed.

Adaptability: Learn new domains quickly and move between them smoothly.

Agency: Act without waiting for approval and adjust as new information comes in.

Soft skills: Communicate clearly, align teams and keep customers’ needs in focus.

Range: Solve different kinds of problems and draw lessons across contexts.

I try to make accountability a priority for my teams. Everyone knows what they own, what success looks like and how it connects to the mission. Perfection isn’t the goal, forward movement is.

Embracing the shift

Focusing on adaptable builders changed everything. These are the people with the range and curiosity to use AI tools to learn quickly and execute confidently.

If you’re a builder who thrives in ambiguity, this is your time. The AI era rewards curiosity and initiative more than credentials. If you’re hiring, look ahead. The people who’ll move your company forward might not be the ones with the perfect résumé for the job. They’re the ones who can grow into what the company will need as it evolves.

The future belongs to generalists and to the companies that trust them.

What is Uber One?

Uber promoted its subscription UberOne, with a monthly cost of $9.99, as a way to save on travel and deliveries, ensuring that people could cancel it at any time.

However, the company misled users about the supposed savings and made the cancellation process considerably more difficult.

In some cases, people had to go through as much as 23 screens, perform 32 shares and wait for a response from a customer service representative to cancel the subscription.

Sometimes, Uber staff's delayed response resulted in the cancellation not being completed on time and another monthly charge being applied.

Despite offering a free trial period, Uber made automatic charges when users were unable to overcome these barriers, and even charged some people. before of the expected payment date.

In a spectacular showcase of triumph, Ducati recently celebrated yet another stellar season at their headquarters in Borgo Panigale during the ‘Campioni in Festa’ event. With Marc Márquez clinching his fourth consecutive title, Ducati solidifies its standing as the powerhouse of MotoGP, boasting a staggering six constructors’ championships. However, as the current regulatory era draws to a close, the racing landscape is set for an explosive transformation come 2027.

With an incredible 17 victories under their belt in 2025 alone, Ducati’s Desmosedici remains the benchmark as we gear up for the 2026 season. But the big question looms: will this dominance continue when the rules shift dramatically? The transition to 850cc engines, alongside significant aerodynamic restrictions and the ban on height devices, could spell trouble for the Italian giants. To further complicate matters, Pirelli tires will replace the long-standing Michelin, adding yet another layer of uncertainty to the upcoming championships.

Claudio Domenicali, Ducati’s CEO, has been vocal about the challenges ahead. “Unfortunately, some innovations that Ducati pioneered are being phased out of the regulations, like height devices and wings. From a regulatory and political standpoint, there are efforts to simplify the rules to prevent Ducati from creating any more groundbreaking technology. Nevertheless, our engineers are incredibly astute. We will have simpler bikes with fewer adjustments available, so we will see who can best navigate this new landscape,” Domenicali stated, highlighting the fierce competition that lies ahead.

As we set our sights on 2027, the rider market is heating up, with all major contracts expiring at the end of 2026. Márquez, undoubtedly the most coveted rider, is set to hit the market, creating a buzz of speculation. “Marc will be available, and naturally, that will be a topic of discussion. He’s been fantastic for us, and we for him, but everything is still to be evaluated. The same goes for Pecco Bagnaia, who has been with us for a considerable time. The market is open to all, but it’s too early to make any moves. I anticipate that the action will pick up around February or March,” Domenicali elaborated.

While there have been instances in the past where major signings occurred before the season kicked off, Domenicali cautions that it’s not always straightforward. “It’s not always that simple; it depends on the timing. Sometimes deals can be struck, and other times they cannot. There is a mutual will to collaborate, but it’s still a bit premature, and not all elements are in place for a smooth transition,” he commented.

Looking ahead, Ducati is also nurturing young talent like Fermín Aldeguer, but the primary focus remains on retaining the legendary #93. “Our philosophy is to support the growth of young riders, just as we did with Pecco and Jorge Martín, while also considering Aldeguer. At the same time, we are open to all possibilities, including Marc this year,” Domenicali affirmed.

As Ducati prepares for a new era in MotoGP, the stakes have never been higher. Will they maintain their grip on the championship, or will the new regulations pave the way for a shocking upset? One thing is for sure: the race to 2027 promises to be a thrilling spectacle!",https://motorcyclesports.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Marc-Marquez.webp,N,,2025-12-21 07:59:30.221552

Chaos Erupts On Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 As ‘Hallucinating’ Passenger Tries To Open Emergency Exit At 39,000 Feet

On a recent Alaska Airlines flight, a passenger started hallucinating and understandably panicking when he thought the plane had lost its wings and that meth was coming out of the air vents. He had been talking to himself and showing signs of panic and aggravation throughout the flight. Then, when he attempted to open the emergency exit door mid-flight, it took 3 people to stop him. This is obviously a serious offense which could get him up to 20 years in prison, but the passenger was also obviously not in his right senses. Apparently, when medical examiners saw him upon landing, he told them he had been drinking for the last 10 days, had been hearing and seeing things, and was also on antidepressants. This reminds me just a bit of the time an Alaska Airlines pilot got high on psychedelic mushrooms and tried to turn the engines off mid-flight.

Uber could face billions in penalties across US after ‘deceptive billing and cancellation practices’

Uber is facing steep penalties for a myriad of issues, including making it confusing and difficult to cancel Uber One subscriptions, among other things. Some Uber customers said they had to go through more than 30 different “actions” across 23 different screens just to cancel their subscription! In this day of one-click functions, 30 actions is beyond frustrating. Customers also complained that the claims of how much savings they’d see with the Uber One membership were ultimately misleading, that discounts never showed up, that they were enrolled in Uber One without knowing it, or that fees kicked in before their free trials were even completed. Uber has many issues to address (or pay for) here.

10 amazing experiences in Northern Ireland

So many travel to Ireland, but Northern Ireland gets, I think, unfairly missed. The culture is magnetic and authentic to its core, and the terrain is both harsh and beautiful. In college, I spent two different semesters living abroad in Derry, Northern Ireland, where I got to do quite a lot of adventuring with local friends. In fact, the #5 recommendation on this list, “Walk 17th century walls,” features the 400+ year old wall that surrounds Derry, which I crossed nearly every day as I’d walk downtown to the chip shop or shopping center. And of course, Derry has a plethora of murals which tell the complex and emotional story of “the troubles” in the 60’s and beyond. (I lived just up the street from these murals, in fact.) But the most obvious recommendation on the list, at least for more light-hearted tourism, is the Causeway Coastal Route, where you can see both the bizarre hexagonal geography of the Giant’s Causeway and the adorably fairy-tale (yet also terrifyingly high) Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge. The Glens of Antrim will also give you the perfect, lush green fairytale landscapes you dream of with a trip to Ireland, so consider adding a few stops in Northern Ireland as well.

Skip The Crowds At Zion’s Narrows For This Equally Scenic Slot Canyon That’s A Day Trip From Las Vegas

My experience at the Narrows at Zion National Park was actually less inundated with crowds than is typical because I was there close to dusk when most (more safety-conscious and wise hikers) were already heading back to dry land. But it’s become one of the go-to hikes in Zion and, like Angel’s Landing, the crowds show it. I am always interested in a “try this instead of this” article if I think it could save me an overcrowded experience where I’m fighting through droves of tourists to snap a picture or catch a view. While I can’t vouch for this suggestion myself, I can vouch for the fact that Utah is absolutely littered with beautiful hikes and slot canyons, which don’t seem to attract more than a handful of visitors. So it doesn’t surprise me at all that a place like this would be both lesser-known and worthy of a visit. This hike is just 4 miles round-trip, but is described as somewhat challenging. Personally, when I’m in Utah, “somewhat challenging” is kind of what I’m looking for. Has anyone been to this spot to attest to its “off-the-beaten-path” nature?",https://frequentmiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/panic-inflight-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 20:58:46.586516

Until recently, discharge petitions were sparsely employed.
The Johnson-era discharge petitions similarly show he has less than an iron fist.
Sponsored by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, it was joined by four House Republicans frustrated with Johnson’s refusal to allow any sort of vote on the subsidies.
You can argue that the sudden frequency of discharge petitions in Johnson’s House is mostly the product of exceptionally narrow party control (at present, the Republicans have just a three-vote majority).","For well over a century, the U.S. House has been a legislative chamber tightly controlled by its leaders. Unlike members of the Senate, House representatives have no automatic right to offer amendments to bills. The leadership-controlled Rules Committee has to certify access to the House floor for votes, plus all amendments. The Speaker’s leadership team controls all committee assignments, which aren’t as completely bound by seniority as they are in the Senate. And there’s no device like the Senate filibuster available in the House to empower minorities to block (and, in many cases, help shape) majority-backed legislation. Enhanced over the decades by especially powerful Speakers, ranging from the late 19th century’s Thomas B. “Czar” Reed to the early 21st century’s Nancy Pelosi, the so-called People’s House hasn’t been run in a particularly democratic manner, except to the extent that “the people” regularly change its composition — and often its partisan control — in two-year intervals.

Beginning in 1910, however, a rare path around the Speaker and the Rules Committee emerged: the so-called discharge petition, which, if signed by a simple majority of members, forces legislation to the floor for an immediate vote. It’s been used to bypass House leadership four times in the roughly two years since Mike Johnson became Speaker. That’s quite the historical anomaly, and it says a lot about the weakness of the current Speaker.

Until recently, discharge petitions were sparsely employed. As an AEI history of the procedure explains, as of 2023, “less than 4 percent of the 638 petitions begun since 1935 got the requisite 218 signatures, and something like 8 percent of bills targeted for discharge were passed by the House.”

Indeed, prior to Johnson’s ascent to the Speakership, only two 21st-century discharge petitions achieved the 218 signatures needed to trigger a floor vote. One, in 2002, forced a successful vote on the famous McCain-Feingold campaign-finance-reform legislation. The next, in 2015, forced a successful vote to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, an object of hatred for many conservative Republicans. The latter dispute was, at the time, interpreted as one of many signs of then-Speaker John Boehner’s weakness.

The Johnson-era discharge petitions similarly show he has less than an iron fist. The first, in September of 2024, involved bottled-up legislation to relieve public employees of a cut in retirement benefits; it was subsequently passed by both houses and signed by President Joe Biden near the end of his term. But the second, third, and fourth happened in quick succession in the autumn of this year.

There was the most famous: the Democrat-generated petition to force a vote on the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Johnson’s futile efforts to head off its success had much to do with his decision to keep the House from meeting before and throughout the longest government shutdown in history. But he couldn’t stop it forever, and eventually he (along with Donald Trump and most congressional Republicans) surrendered and backed the bill. Then another Democrat-created petition, which hit 218 signatures in late November and forced a successful vote on a bill to reverse Trump’s efforts to kill collective-bargaining rights among federal employees. And the latest, filed just last week, will force a vote on a “clean” extension of expiring Obamacare premium subsidies. Sponsored by House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, it was joined by four House Republicans frustrated with Johnson’s refusal to allow any sort of vote on the subsidies. The vote will take place once the House returns from its Christmas break in January.

You can argue that the sudden frequency of discharge petitions in Johnson’s House is mostly the product of exceptionally narrow party control (at present, the Republicans have just a three-vote majority). But Pelosi had some periods of very narrow partisan control during her last two years as Speaker, 2021 and 2022, and never faced this sort of open revolt.

Without question, Johnson’s grip on the gavel is becoming slippery. The odds are high he’ll lose it in next year’s midterm elections. But signs of weakness invite further revolts by House members who fear voters more than this mild-mannered former backbencher from Louisiana, whose authority is totally dependent on Trump’s backing, which can be erratic during times when the president is distracted by nonlegislative matters like ending wars and naming things after himself. Politicians, like guard dogs, can smell fear and irresolution. If discharge petitions keep popping up and forcing votes, Johnson may lose control of the House altogether and not even make it to the midterms as Speaker.",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/349/584/0e629e1a77c3c33b5562465455ef2235ee-Mike-Johnson-lede.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 22:00:35.954060

SoftBank pledged in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, with $10 billion delivered immediately.
SoftBank’s aggressive push to fund OpenAI illustrates the high stakes of the AI race and the lengths even the world’s most seasoned investors will go to secure a foothold in the sector.","SoftBank Group is racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by the end of the year, employing a mix of cash-raising strategies that include selling stakes in major holdings and leveraging margin loans, sources told Reuters. The push marks one of the boldest moves yet by CEO Masayoshi Son, as the Japanese billionaire aims to strengthen SoftBank’s position in the increasingly competitive artificial intelligence sector.

To assemble the necessary capital, Son has already sold SoftBank’s entire $5.8 billion stake in AI chip leader Nvidia, offloaded $4.8 billion in T-Mobile US shares, and implemented staff reductions across the group. Dealmaking at SoftBank’s Vision Fund has slowed dramatically, with any investment exceeding $50 million now requiring Son’s explicit approval, sources said.

In addition to divestments, SoftBank is moving forward with its plan to take its payments operator PayPay public. Originally slated for this month, the initial public offering was delayed due to the 43-day U.S. government shutdown, which ended in November. The debut is now expected in the first quarter of next year and could raise more than $20 billion, according to sources familiar with the process.

SoftBank is also exploring partial exits from its holdings in Didi Global, China’s major ride-hailing operator. Didi plans to relist in Hong Kong after a U.S. delisting in 2021, following a regulatory crackdown, a source said. Vision Fund managers are being directed to prioritize the OpenAI deal over other opportunities.

The urgency to secure funds underscores the financial strain even the largest global investors face as they seek to finance massive AI projects, including data centers costing hundreds of billions of dollars. SoftBank has multiple avenues to tap, including cash on its balance sheet, corporate bonds, margin loans, and stakes in listed companies.

A significant source of capital could come from SoftBank’s undrawn margin loans backed by its 100% ownership of Arm Holdings, the British semiconductor and software design company. The firm recently expanded this borrowing capacity by $6.5 billion, bringing total undrawn loans to $11.5 billion. Arm’s stock has more than tripled since its IPO, giving SoftBank additional collateral to support new borrowing.

As of September 30, SoftBank reported parent-level cash of 4.2 trillion yen ($27.16 billion) and still holds about 4% of T-Mobile US, valued at roughly $11 billion. Despite slowing new investments, the company has continued backing AI startups including Sierra and Skild AI.

The funding is critical for OpenAI, which, alongside SoftBank, is investing in Stargate, a $500 billion initiative to build AI data centers for training and inference. These centers are considered crucial to maintaining U.S. competitiveness in AI against China. The push to expand data center capacity has also prompted tech giants like Meta to commit massive capital, raising concerns about potential overinvestment in the sector.

SoftBank pledged in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI, with $10 billion delivered immediately. The remaining funds were contingent on OpenAI transitioning to a for-profit structure by year-end—a milestone it achieved in October.

The new capital will help OpenAI cover soaring costs for training and operating its AI models as competition intensifies from Google’s Gemini and other rivals. CEO Sam Altman recently described the company as entering a “code red” phase to enhance ChatGPT, temporarily delaying other product rollouts. OpenAI’s long-term ambitions remain staggering: Altman has outlined plans to build 30 gigawatts of computing capacity for $1.4 trillion and ultimately add one gigawatt of compute per week, with each gigawatt costing over $40 billion.

Gemini 3 Flash benchmark performance is stellar: 78.0% on SWE-bench Verified, 95.2% on AIME 2025, 33.7% on HLE. This beats Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4.5 overall and comes close to Gemini 3 Pro, even beating the latter on SWE-Bench Verified.

Gemini 3 Flash is trained for broad usage across real-time workflows and agentic applications, and Google is deploying it widely, using it as the new default in the Gemini app, AI Mode in Google Search, and Google’s developer tools such as Gemini API, Android Studio, and Vertex AI. The API cost for Gemini 3 Flash is $0.50/M input tokens and $3.00/M output tokens, higher than Gemini 2.5 Flash but significantly less than competing similar-performing AI models. This makes Gemini 3 Flash a good daily driver AI model for many use cases.

And the settings, which sit in a revamped Personalization menu, allow people to opt for More, Less, or Default for any given characteristic and add new toggles that determine whether the bot will write headers and lists. It’s a minor UI change with major implications: Users no longer have to constantly tap for “less peppy” or “friendlier” replies, while teams can adjust the AI’s tone more closely to brand or context.

What’s New in ChatGPT Personalization Settings

The Personalization controls are more like Grecian Formula than personality transplants. Want energetic brainstorming? Set enthusiasm to More. Need a neutral compliance summary? (Set Less for warmth and emoji use here.) The additions supplement the November trio of base styles Professional, Candid, and Quirky, so users can add a general tone along with more specific tweaks. OpenAI also factored in preferences for structural choices, enabling the assistant to default to including lists and headers for scannability or just stick with plain paragraphs if a narrative answer is more appropriate.

Why Tone Control Matters for ChatGPT Users

ChatGPT’s tone has been a flashpoint all year. One update was a little too agreeable and swept into reverse when users objected to “sycophantic” behavior. It then adjusted its latest model to be warmer after hearing that the responses were becoming too clinical. The new controls are a practical solution; instead of trying to secure a timeless voice that appeals to everyone, OpenAI is turning people loose on the volume knob for friendliness and flair.

There’s also a behavioral safety aspect. Researchers at Stanford and Anthropic have written about how big language models may be too ready to reproduce what users think, a trend critics worry could foster reliance or create echo chambers. Tinkering with enthusiasm and warmth — it won’t solve that altogether, but gives users and companies a way to “tone down the flattery,” to rein in gushing praise, and keep interactions more firmly grounded — particularly in delicate arenas like mental health counseling or news consumption.

Early Use Cases and Real-Life Examples for Teams

And support teams can standardize their replies by turning the warmth slider to More and keeping enthusiasm at Default, which would generate warm but not effusive messages. Recruiters can decrease or limit emojis for candidate outreach to appear more professional, while marketing teams can increase engagement around brainstorming content ideas. Teachers could opt for Less warmth, sunshiny esprit during grading, sounding purely neutral and reading plainly as opposed to cheerily.

The structure toggles matter, too. The assistant can be biased toward short bullet lists and headings if the analysts who are writing executive summaries tend to do so, or the opposite, if, with complex legal issues, it is better to use flowing prose. There’s also a tangential upside in instant efficiency: A few key settings can cut down on the kind of redundant guidelines (there are no emojis here!) or suggestions like “list, not paragraphs,” which can free up some tokens and help keep responses more consistent among your team anyway.

How It Fits With the Other Controls Already in Place

These dials stack on top of system instructions, custom profiles, and base style presets. Base styles are like the general color palette, and the new controls are saturation and brightness sliders. Companies that employ admin policies can set defaults that suit their brand voice and let users dial it in to individual preferences. At a high level this negates the need for power-users to default to tone design through verbose prompts, by considering it as a first-class stateful setting.

Limitations and Open Questions for Tone Controls

You can then use these weights to refine the results returned by PageRank according to your particular preferences. These controls are purposefully straightforward (More, Less, Default) and you won’t be assured of producing consistent outputs across all queries or domains. Context still helps; technical and creative topics naturally lend themselves to cooler and flashier terms. It’s also not clear how these settings interact with shared workspaces, if org-level defaults outweigh user preferences, and how the model weighs several settings if they contradict (for instance, high enthusiasm but low emoji use).

The Broader Context of AI Controllability

Steerability — the ability for a user to have some control over style without losing substance — is an emerging battleground. Microsoft’s writing assistants and productivity tools already include controls for tone, like Formal or Casual, as enterprise buyers increasingly demand governance features that lock down voice and guard against behavioral drift. Analysts at organizations such as Gartner have described controllability as a cornerstone in scaling responsible generative AI, because it helps maintain brand consistency, cut prompt variance and achieve compliance expectations.

OpenAI’s decision does not halt arguments about how models should behave, but it does alter the balance of power toward users. Rather than suffering through a one-size-fits-all personality, you can set the vibe once and then get on with it. For everyone who is sick of getting encouraged when they just wanted the facts — or conversely, wished the bot sounded less like a tax memo — that’s a welcome change.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/openai_adds_passion_controls_to_chatgpt_tone_setti_edited_1766268246.png,N,,2025-12-20 20:58:42.900827

It’s another record for the sector, and further evidence that concerns around an AI slowdown haven’t dampened investor enthusiasm.

AI Infrastructure Demand Drives Record Deals

S&P Global credits the increase to hyperscale buildouts intended to service compute-hungry training and inference workloads. Cloud providers and AI platform operators are locking up multi-year capacity, usually pre-leasing entire campuses prior to breaking ground. Sorry, there are no AI applications in the world that prove killer at scale. However, industry consultants speaking to CNBC noted that demand for these kinds of AI workloads is robust in the data center: GPU clusters, high-density racks, and specialized networking still fetch premium prices.

Markets with available power and fiber—such as Northern Virginia’s “Data Center Alley,” Phoenix, Dallas, or parts of Ohio—still attract mega-campuses, while Europe’s main hubs like Frankfurt and Dublin are limited by permitting constraints and grid capacity. Developers are also branching out in so-called second-tier metros where utilities can act more quickly, and combining sites with long-term renewable power contracts to help businesses meet corporate sustainability goals.

Private Equity Drives the Financing Wave

Behind the headline number, a majority of financing is private equity and structured debt, S&P Global notes. That’s partly because of the sheer capital intensity of modern campuses — often billions per site — and rising interest rates, making buyers with cash and flexible balance sheets more attractive. Big infrastructure funds and alternative asset managers have swooped down through platform acquisitions, joint ventures, and sale-leasebacks, exchanging stable, contracted cash flows for more leverage.

The model is not foolproof. These debt-laden structures rely on fast delivery schedules, consistent lease-up, and cheap power. Running behind schedule for utility interconnections, the supply of GPUs, or a halt in AI spending could reduce returns. Yet with committed anchors in place and 10- to 20-year power and land strategies, many operators argue that, at their core, the fundamentals look more like those of infrastructure than cyclical tech.

Power and Land Limits Define Development Strategy

Capacity is as much a question of electricity — no longer just real estate. An S&P Global outlook predicted that data center power draw — currently on pace to grow by around 22% over the planning period, and potentially triple by decade’s end — accounted for roughly 2% of global electricity demand last year. That is in line with trends monitored by the International Energy Agency and Uptime Institute that indicate longer interconnection queues, transformer constraints, and competition with industrial loads.

Operators are adapting with multi-pronged strategies:

Secure a renewable PPA several years ahead of time

Design for liquid cooling to support high-density AI nodes

Co-locate facilities next to generation

Investigate on-site resources like battery storage or fuel cells to work around grid constraints

In some metros, utilities have made queuing reforms or phased caps a condition for interconnection, which has forced developers to divide campuses between service territories in order to spread risk.

Community Pushback and the Policy Response

As investors rush ahead, local opposition is gaining strength. A coalition of more than 300 environmental and civic groups recently asked governors and state regulators to pause approvals of large-scale data centers until they could demand better assessments of water use, emissions, and grid impacts. In some cases, community challenges have delayed or altered projects in locales like Virginia and Wisconsin, where residents and advocacy organizations have voiced concerns about noise, diesel backup generators, and tax incentives.

Policymakers are pulling in divergent directions. Some state and federal officials are trying to expedite permits for AI infrastructure; others are adding guardrails on siting, water withdrawals, and energy acquisition. European regulators, meanwhile, are raising the bar for efficiency reporting and heat-reuse requirements that might also affect design decisions worldwide.

Investor and Operator Outlook for Data Centers

What follows will depend on three variables: the availability of power, the supply of chips, and the cost of capital. If utilities can add capacity quickly enough, and if buyers of AI maintain multi-year commitments, today’s pipeline may translate into reliable cash flows linked to inflation. If not, the dollars will probably increasingly flow to markets equipped with faster interconnects and modular design, as well as hybrid models that offer wholesale, colocation, and build-to-suit capabilities.

For now, the number that counts is $61 billion. It’s a portrait of an industry in full buildout mode, with capital pursuing compute as AI moves from pilots to production. As the researchers and market analysts of S&P Global point out to CNBC and other outlets, the bottlenecks are real — but so is the demand.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/featured_edited_1766264524.png,N,,2025-12-20 22:00:39.817370

Airports in New York, Tampa, Chicago, Dallas, Des Moines, and more are seeing widespread impacts as flight schedules are heavily affected. Weather conditions, airport congestion, and increased air traffic volumes are major contributors to these delays. Passengers are experiencing long wait times and frustration, with many flights being delayed or canceled at some of the busiest airports in the country.

As a result, travelers are being advised to stay updated on their flight statuses and contact airlines for rebooking options. With major cities like New York, Chicago, and Dallas reporting significant disruptions, this has become one of the most challenging travel days of the year for many.

Disruption Causes: Reasons Behind the Delays

Today, travelers across the U.S. are facing significant disruptions with 4,603 delays and 257 cancellations reported. These widespread travel issues, affecting major airports and airlines, are primarily caused by factors like weather conditions, airport congestion, and increased volumes, leading to longer wait times for passengers.

At Aspen/Pitkin County Airport (ASE), low ceilings are causing an average delay of 112 minutes, as poor visibility forces aircraft to hold or delay departures. Akron-Canton Airport (CAK) is experiencing delays due to deicing procedures, essential for flight safety when ice forms on aircraft. Eagle County Airport (EGE) reports 100-minute delays due to high airport volume, especially during peak travel times, leading to congestion and slower processing. Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) is dealing with 45-minute delays (and increasing), as both high air traffic volume and weather-related factors intensify the situation.

Westchester County Airport (HPN) has an average 30-minute delay caused by departure volume, as the number of departing flights exceeds capacity. San Diego International Airport (SAN) is also affected by high volumes, leading to progressively longer delays. At Teterboro Airport (TEB), traffic management initiatives are causing 90-minute delays, while Van Nuys Airport (VNY) is experiencing delays due to compact demand, as a high volume of flights operates within limited time frames.

Airports affected across U.S.

Major airports across the U.S. are facing significant disruptions today. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International (ATL) leads with 30 cancellations and 402 delays, making it one of the hardest-hit airports. Los Angeles International (LAX) follows closely with 19 cancellations and 233 delays, contributing to widespread travel challenges. Newark Liberty International (EWR) is also affected, reporting 17 cancellations and 155 delays, highlighting the busy airport’s struggle to manage traffic. Dallas-Fort Worth International (DFW) is experiencing 14 cancellations and 223 delays, impacting travelers flying in and out of Dallas. Similarly, Orlando International (MCO) reports 14 cancellations and 155 delays, leaving many passengers frustrated as they face long wait times.

U.S. Airlines affected

Today, several major U.S. airlines are experiencing significant disruptions with cancellations and delays affecting thousands of passengers. PSA Airlines, operating for American Airlines, has experienced the highest number of cancellations today, with 43 cancellations and 125 delays. Delta Air Lines is one of the most impacted, reporting 35 cancellations and 370 delays. Southwest Airlines follows closely, with 29 cancellations and a staggering 727 delays, significantly affecting its extensive domestic network. Spirit Airlines has also been hit hard, with 37 cancellations and 166 delays, while American Airlines is managing 3 cancellations and 423 delays. United Airlines reports 12 cancellations and 308 delays, contributing to widespread frustration at major airports.

Impact on Passengers: What Travelers Can Do Now

U.S. Travelers facing delays today due to low ceilings, deicing, airport congestion, and increased volumes should take several steps to manage the situation. First, it’s essential to stay informed about flight status by regularly checking updates, as departure times may change depending on airport conditions. If experiencing extended delays or cancellations, contact your airline for rebooking or compensation options, as many airlines offer alternate flights or vouchers.

Conclusion

Today’s flight disruptions across U.S. airports are largely due to factors such as weather conditions, airport congestion, and high volumes of air traffic. Passengers traveling through affected airports like ASE, EWR, HPN, SAN, and VNY should be prepared for delays and make sure to stay informed about the status of their flights. With over 4,603 delays and 257 cancellations, flexibility, and communication with airlines are key to managing the day’s challenges.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/US-travel.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 22:00:26.613993

FCMB posts strong earnings, recapitalization on track Founded in 1982 by Otunba Subomi Balogun, FCMB has grown into one of Nigeria’s leading financial groups, serving retail, commercial and institutional clients.
Under Ladi Balogun, the bank has expanded its income base and posted solid results in a high-interest-rate environment.
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, FCMB reported gross earnings of N828.1 billion ($570 million), up 40.9 percent from a year earlier.
Total assets stood at N7.23 trillion ($4.97 billion), while assets under management rose to N1.59 trillion ($1.09 billion).","FCMB Group, a financial services holding company led by Nigerian banking executive Ladi Balogun, has secured shareholder approval to raise up to N400 billion ($274 million), a move that clears a major hurdle as the Nigerian financial services holding company works to retain its international banking license and comply with new regulatory capital requirements.

The approval was granted at an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), where shareholders endorsed an expanded capital plan that management says will place the group well ahead of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s March 2026 recapitalization deadline. For FCMB, this offers both regulatory breathing room and a vote of confidence after a year of strong earnings growth.

FCMB funds growth, tech, offshore expansion

In a filing with the Nigerian Exchange, the group said its banking subsidiary is already on course to meet the higher capital threshold. FCMB noted that it has completed a public offer and expects to close the sale of a minority stake in one of its units before the end of December.

“Subject to capital verification by the CBN, shareholder approval and the required regulatory consents, we are positioned to deliver the N500 billion capital target ahead of the March 2026 deadline for FCMB Limited,” the company said in the filing.

Speaking at the meeting, Group CEO Ladi Balogun thanked shareholders for their backing and said the additional funds would be used carefully, with a focus on balance sheet strength and long-term returns. He added that the capital will help improve capital adequacy, lower reliance on expensive deposits, and support investments in staff, technology and its offshore operations.

Strong returns expected for shareholders

Balogun also outlined expectations for shareholder returns, saying the group expects earnings per share to rise by more than 50 percent on average over the next two years. He added that a stronger capital position should support higher dividend payments, with the capital adequacy ratio projected to remain above 20 percent.

Shareholders also approved the acceptance of oversubscription from the group’s 2025 public offer, subject to limits set by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory approvals. FCMB said the oversubscription reflects strong investor demand for its shares.

As part of the resolution, FCMB’s issued share capital will increase from N30 billion through the creation of additional ordinary shares required to complete the capital raise. The new shares will rank equally with existing shares.

For the nine months ended Sept. 30, FCMB reported gross earnings of N828.1 billion ($570 million), up 40.9 percent from a year earlier. Interest income climbed 64.7 percent, offsetting a decline in non-interest income caused by lower currency revaluation gains. Profit after tax rose 52 percent to N125.45 billion ($86.2 million), lifting return on average equity to 22.4 percent.

Total assets stood at N7.23 trillion ($4.97 billion), while assets under management rose to N1.59 trillion ($1.09 billion). Retained earnings increased to N291.9 billion ($200.6 million). With capital verification underway and regulatory approvals pending, FCMB says it remains on track to complete its recapitalization well before the 2026 deadline, positioning the group for growth.",https://www.billionaires.africa/content/images/2025/12/Ladi-Balogun-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 13:00:51.430959

And any hiccups — a winter storm or a computer outage — can snowball into massive disruptions.That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have “interline agreements” that let them put stranded customers on another carrier’s flights.This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That’s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.“When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,” said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.“They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,” and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said.Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays — Delta, United and JetBlue, for example — are now using the government standard.Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page.Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn’t pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks into a government shutdown that started in December 2019.“While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,” TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.AAA advises travelers to “continue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,” spokesperson Diaz said. “Airport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.”Planning ahead for 2025Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year’s trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.“Because travel is so popular, you’re not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,” Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. “If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.”

Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it: it’s beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S.

The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home between Saturday and New Year’s Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019.

Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Monday, Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year.

A government shutdown that could start as soon as Saturday would likely be too close to the holidays to immediately affect flights and airport operations, but that might change if a shutdown dragged on.

What will be the busiest travel days?

Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year — by a wide margin — was Thanksgiving Day.

The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through January 2.

About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.

“Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,” AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.

This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.

Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That’s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive.

“When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,” said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet.

People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight.

“They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,” and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said.

Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays — Delta, United and JetBlue, for example — are now using the government standard.

Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page.

Would a government shutdown affect flights and airports?

A government shutdown could occur if Congress doesn’t pass a funding bill with a midnight Friday deadline. Most TSA workers at airports, air traffic controllers and customs agents are considered essential and would be required to work without pay in the event of a shutdown.

More uncompensated workers might call out sick the longer a shutdown lasts, which could lead to longer security lines and other delays. That appeared to be the case several weeks into a government shutdown that started in December 2019.

“While our personnel have prepared to handle high volumes of travelers and ensure safe travel, an extended shutdown could mean longer wait times at airports,” TSA spokesman Carter Langston said in a statement.

AAA advises travelers to “continue with their holiday plans, even if the shutdown materializes,” spokesperson Diaz said. “Airport operations will continue as normal, but perhaps run a bit slower than usual, so travelers should be aware of that.”

Planning ahead for 2025

Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year’s trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations.

“Because travel is so popular, you’re not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,” Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. “If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.”","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/xna-travelers-november-2025-692372bb42fd7.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-12-20 17:02:11.299151

And yet many of the same questions and challenges remain: Who gets left behind when public health systems collapse under political pressure or moral panic?
In a time of renewed political backlash and public health failures, GMHC’s story is more than history – it’s a guide.","The story of the AIDS movement is one of regular people: students, bartenders, stay-at-home mothers, teachers, retired lawyers, immigrants, Catholic nuns, newly out gay men who had just arrived in New York, and many others. Some had lost friends or lovers. Some felt a moral calling. Some were just trying to balance their sexual karma. Many were angry. Most had no medical background or professional credentials – just a sense of urgency, tenacity and an unwillingness to look away.

When Gay Men’s Health Crisis, the world’s first AIDS service organization, was founded in 1982, it was regular people trying to meet the needs of all people living with AIDS. Its workforce of volunteers provided HIV prevention education as well as physical, emotional and legal support.

At the start of the epidemic, AIDS was considered a “gay plague,” and to be openly queer was to risk abandonment, eviction, assault or worse. Families disowned their children. Hospitals turned patients away. Funeral homes refused bodies. And many people with AIDS found themselves alone and in need.

Public officials didn’t just fail to act – they refused to acknowledge that anything was happening at all. Elected leaders such as President Ronald Reagan and Sen. Jesse Helms stoked the moral panic guiding public policy by declaring people with AIDS “perverted human being(s).”

In 2025, with the Trump administration cutting federal funding for HIV research and support services and restricting protections and services for LGBTQ+ people, studying how everyday people approached the early AIDS crisis provides a model for surviving through innovation, commitment and community.

Stories informing the present

“I think 26,000 people died before (Reagan) even bothered to utter the word ‘AIDS,’” said Tim Sweeney, former executive director of Gay Men’s Health Crisis.

This quote is featured in the GMHC Stories Oral History Project, a collection of over 100 interviews with former volunteers, staff and donors from the first 15 years of the organization. Along with our colleague Julia Haager, we and our team at Binghamton University’s Human Sexualities Lab compiled these interviews. Acquired by the Manuscripts and Archives Division of The New York Public Library, the collection is scheduled to open in fall 2025, showcasing how everyday people responded to the AIDS crisis.

These stories document how a community presented with a set of circumstances threatening their very existence built a self-sustaining organization to advocate for and provide care to each other outside institutional support. They did this while enduring grief, standing up to external threats and navigating internal tensions.

Improvisation for survival

The work was an ongoing challenge. Organizations dedicated to aiding people affected by AIDS such as Gay Men’s Health Crisis were left to fund their own survival – and defend their right to do the work. When North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms moved in 1988 to eliminate federal support for AIDS service programs that mentioned homosexuality, it severely limited AIDS prevention efforts nation wide. However, GMHC had the foresight to fund its more explicit education materials with private donations.

At the beginning of the epidemic, queer New Yorkers and their allies had to improvise new systems of care in the absence of state and federal support. “People often (ask) me, what was the model you worked off of?” said Sweeney. “And I said, there was no model, there was just a muddle. We just made it up the whole time.”

What they created almost overnight was staggering. “There were over 1,000 volunteers in the agency,” recalled staff member Tom Weber, who started at GMHC as an office volunteer in 1988. “We would have orientations every single week, and they would flood in.”

One of the most well-known expressions of that volunteer labor was the buddy program, where lay caregivers provided emotional and practical support to people living with AIDS. “A lot of people were not alone in their death because of the work that we did,” said Barbara Danish, who led the buddy program from 1996 to 2002.

Education and prevention were also grounded in queer culture and community. Unlike early depictions of AIDS in the media that reduced patients to “vectors” of transmission, it was defiantly sex-positive. “We came up with shit that no one in the world had ever done,” Sweeney said. “Because finally it was gay men saying … we’re going to talk to each other about how to stay safe, healthy and sexy.”

When that sense of mission extended to emotional survival, humor and unapologetically queer culture were critical to bearing the weight of the work. “Sometimes you just break down and cry for an hour. But that’s how you survive it – by staying authentic to your emotions,” said Tommy Thomson, former director of client programs. She recalled how staff member “Carolotta,” or Carl, would sometimes put condoms and chocolate in a basket and go from office to office, frequently in drag. He would offer either or both to make people feel better. “He’d make you remember that you weren’t alone, and that we all know how hard it is. That’s part of what held you together.”

Internal tensions

Although Gay Men’s Health Crisis remained mission-driven, its internal politics were never simple. As it grew in size and national stature, it confronted the limits of its founding identity.

Founded by, and initially serving, primarily white gay men, GMHC sometimes struggled to adapt to the emerging realities of the epidemic. While AIDS also affected people of color, women and intravenous drug users from the outset, much of the agency’s early prevention and outreach work was designed with gay men in mind.

By the late 1980s, the increase in AIDS cases among white gay men had begun to plateau, while rates among Black and Latino people, women and IV drug users continued to rise sharply into the next decade. Women and people of color who were deeply embedded in GMHC’s operations nonetheless had to navigate assumptions about whose needs were prioritized – assumptions that often manifested in how resources were allocated and services were designed. As GMHC expanded its outreach to Black and Latino populations, it struggled to be culturally responsive and build trust in communities that had long been underserved and stigmatized.

As GMHC grew, it became more and more successful in fundraising and visibility, while smaller organizations sometimes struggled to access resources. This led to growing tensions, particularly in communities of color, where local groups feared that GMHC’s expansion would limit funding and undercut their efforts at community-specific approaches to care and prevention. In addition, efforts to address racism, sexism and cultural insensitivity encountered both support and indifference.

Yet, staff and volunteers continued to push – reshaping messaging, fighting for inclusive programming, and holding conversations about race, gender, power and public health. For staff and volunteers, the agency was a complicated institution that could both empower and marginalize. Its strength, and its struggle, was learning how to expand without losing sight of the legacy and history it was built on.

A guide for today

Forty years later, LGBTQ+ people face a new set of crises in a landscape riddled with dangers.

Trans health care is being banned in multiple states. Book bans and surveillance laws are targeting queer youth. Anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric is fueling violence and censorship. Funding for HIV prevention and research is disappearing even as new infections persist. Black and brown communities still face disproportionate barriers to health care and housing. Decades of scientific progress and medical discoveries are coming to a halt with funding cuts under the Trump administration.

And yet many of the same questions and challenges remain: Who gets left behind when public health systems collapse under political pressure or moral panic? Who will do the work when institutions fail? What does it mean to care for one another in the midst of the wreckage? How do people come together across differences?

The history of GMHC is more than memory – it is a lesson in the possibility of care, creativity and community, especially in the face of fear and uncertainty today. It shows how people can come together – not just to demand policy change, but to directly meet one another’s needs with whatever resources they have. It is a reminder that mutual aid is powerful; that grief can coexist with joy; and that queer resilience has always included laughter, desire and shared vulnerability. In a time of renewed political backlash and public health failures, GMHC’s story is more than history – it’s a guide. Today, the staff and volunteers at GMHC continue their work to confront the epidemic and uplift the lives of all people affected by AIDS.

“We’d say to them, ‘You’re just ordinary citizens doing extraordinary things,’” Sweeney said. “And we really meant that.”

What was once met with caution, policy debates and outright bans is now being woven into the daily rhythm of academic life. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is emerging as an early beneficiary of that shift, quietly securing a foothold in higher education as universities rethink how students learn, research and work.

Across public university systems, ChatGPT is no longer treated as a fringe study tool. Institutions are increasingly licensing the platform for broad use among students and faculty, signaling a move away from enforcement toward education. The change reflects a growing belief that generative AI is not a temporary disruption but a permanent presence in modern learning.

ChatGPT finds early footing on campuses

OpenAI has sold more than 700,000 ChatGPT licenses across about 35 public universities, according to Bloomberg. These agreements typically cover both students and faculty, positioning the software as a general-purpose academic assistant rather than a single-use product.

On campuses, ChatGPT is being used for writing support, coding help, data analysis and research preparation. Faculty members rely on it to streamline administrative tasks and curriculum planning, while students turn to it as an everyday aid for organizing ideas and solving problems. That wide range of uses has helped normalize the tool within academic environments that once viewed AI with skepticism.

Unlike earlier educational technologies that arrived through top-down mandates, ChatGPT has spread partly through student demand. Many undergraduates arrive already familiar with the platform, having used it before enrolling. Universities that adopt it formally are often responding to existing behavior rather than introducing something entirely new.

Why students gravitate toward ChatGPT

While major competitors also offer AI tools, adoption patterns suggest a divide in how those products are used. Microsoft’s Copilot, often bundled into enterprise software agreements, tends to see heavier use among faculty and administrative staff. ChatGPT, by contrast, has gained traction as a standalone product that students actively seek out.

That distinction matters. Tools chosen voluntarily are more likely to shape habits, especially during formative years. As students integrate ChatGPT into their workflows, faculty are adjusting assignments and expectations, reinforcing its role rather than attempting to restrict it.

OpenAI appears intent on reaching users early, before academic routines and professional habits are firmly established. The strategy mirrors how other digital platforms gained long-term influence by becoming familiar during school years.

Teaching responsible use instead of bans

Universities are increasingly framing AI as something to be taught responsibly rather than prohibited. Many institutions now focus on guiding students in ethical use, verification of outputs and understanding limitations. This approach reflects a broader shift in academic culture, one that recognizes AI literacy as a necessary skill.

The change also acknowledges reality. Policing AI use has proven difficult, while thoughtful integration offers a chance to shape how students engage with emerging technology. For administrators, the question is no longer whether students will use AI, but how.

Education’s role in OpenAI’s bigger ambitions

OpenAI’s expanding presence in higher education comes as the company’s ambitions continue to grow. Separate reports indicate it has held early discussions with investors about raising up to $100 billion at a valuation near $750 billion, up sharply from the roughly $500 billion figure tied to a secondary share sale earlier this year.

The company is also widely reported to be laying groundwork for a future initial public offering, potentially as soon as 2026, with some projections placing its value close to $1 trillion. Those figures highlight how central scale and long-term adoption are to OpenAI’s strategy.

Education plays a unique role in that vision. If ChatGPT becomes the default AI assistant for students today, it may influence how future workers write, code and think. In a crowded AI market, familiarity can translate into loyalty.

For now, OpenAI’s growing presence on campuses reflects a broader reality. Artificial intelligence is no longer an experiment in higher education. It is becoming part of the infrastructure.",https://rollingout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2378605551.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 19:01:40.727693

The forecast arrives as content leaders face escalating demands—95.2% consider visual content critical for business communications, according to Adobe research cited in the report. Content needs are growing between five and twenty times current levels.

The report synthesized extensive internal and external research alongside feedback from Adobe Creative Cloud communities. According to Deepa Subramaniam, Vice President of Product Marketing for Creative Professionals at Adobe, creativity now faces a ""perfect storm"" of soaring content demands, reduced resources, and transformative AI capabilities. ""The most forward-thinking teams aren't just adding new tools,"" Subramaniam stated in the report. ""They're building systems that bring people, ideas, and workflows together in a more connected, collaborative way.""

Four trends emerged from Adobe's analysis. Each addresses different aspects of visual communication, from sensory engagement to cultural authenticity.

Multisensory visual experiences

The first trend emphasizes creating content that engages multiple senses simultaneously through texture, motion, sound, and implied sensory qualities. Research cited by The Drum showed 82% of global consumers expect their senses engaged when experiencing new content.

Brenda Mills, Principal of Consumer and Creative Insights at Adobe, explained the shift in the report. ""Our lives are so screen-focused that, since the Covid shutdown, people have had an insatiable desire to have all their senses engaged,"" Mills stated. ""We are living in a crowded visual landscape, so people expect images to deliver more than ever before.""

WGSN research referenced in Adobe's report indicated 68% of customers want brands to create remarkable out-of-the-box campaigns. An additional 78% demonstrate higher likelihood to purchase from brands making them feel joy.

The technical implementation requires designing AI prompts describing more than visual appearance. Prompts must suggest how content might feel, sound, or smell. Audio elements become essential components rather than supplementary additions.

Corporate Reputation Review published research finding that engaging multiple senses significantly enhanced brand experience and customer satisfaction among Chinese consumers. The study suggested this pattern extends globally.

Adobe's GenStudio platform received significant expansions in October 2025, introducing proprietary AI model customization through Adobe Firefly Foundry. The platform integrated with major advertising systems including Amazon Ads, Google Marketing Platform, Innovid, LinkedIn, and TikTok.

Emotional connection through intentional craft

Adobe's second trend focuses on deliberately crafting moments that evoke shared human emotions. The approach, termed ""Connectioneering"" in the report, emphasizes authentic emotional resonance over promotional messaging.

Mills explained the fundamental motivation in the report. ""People really want to feel what connects us all to the special, valuable things that make us human,"" she stated.

Gallup research cited in Adobe's document indicated 95% of consumer decisions stem from emotional factors. Greenbook research found 70% of purchase decisions are shaped by an average of ten emotional needs.

The implementation requires setting up moments bridging regions and industries through universal emotional takeaways. Video content particularly benefits from music selection that captures and amplifies the intended mood. Every element reinforces the core spirit of the work.

The approach contrasts with purely informational advertising. Viewers stop noticing branding elements and instead experience the message directly through emotional engagement with shared joy, inspiration, or connection.

Research from multiple advertising studies throughout 2025 demonstrated consumer preferences for personalized content addressing emotional needs. Adobe's May 2025 study of over 1,000 Americans revealed specific preferences for brand engagement frequency and content personalization.

Surreal and playful design execution

Adobe's third trend encourages deliberately strange, humorous visual approaches that intrigue and entertain audiences. The surreal design strategy leverages generative AI capabilities to create imagery that stretches logic and bends physics.

VICE research cited in the report showed 68% of global youth actively search for humorous content providing escapism from reality.

Mills characterized the approach in the report. ""These are strange times, and if you can pivot and present strangeness in a humorous way, it's outrageously engaging and entertaining,"" she stated. ""It's an extremely clever approach I truly admire.""

Kantar research referenced in Adobe's forecast indicated brands described as fun and playful demonstrate significantly better performance in building future demand. Nutter Butter's TikTok series earned Social Campaign of the Year at the 2025 AdAge Creativity Awards by captivating Generation Z audiences through unexpected creative execution.

The technical enabler involves allowing generative AI tools like Adobe Firefly to operate without constraints forcing mimicry of existing visual conventions. Brands can discover entirely new aesthetic territories when AI systems imagine what doesn't currently exist rather than reproducing familiar patterns.

Industry research on creative trends throughout 2025 identified shifts toward dense, layered content particularly appealing to younger demographics. YouTube's September 2025 Culture & Trends report revealed ""Creative Maximalism"" as a dominant format incorporating multiple visual and audio information layers.

Local cultural authenticity

Adobe's fourth trend emphasizes partnering with local creators and spotlighting regional craftsmanship to achieve authentic representation. The approach positions locally rooted stories on global stages.

The trend emerges as Generation Z increasingly embraces ""appstinence""—conscious breaks from constant connectivity. This shift makes discovery of local cultures and communities more appealing than generic global content.

Mills explained the personalization aspect in the report. ""I work with a lot of enterprise customers for Adobe, and they're constantly asking for more authentic regional and local imagery so they can appeal to specific regions where their customers live,"" she stated. ""When people see themselves or their communities represented, it humanizes the company.""

Implementation requires stories belonging to communities rather than simply being about them. Collaboration with local talent both behind and in front of cameras becomes essential. Authentic cultural voices should remain unfiltered by translation or external interpretation.

Nike launched women's footwear in partnership with Delhi-based brand NorBlack NorWhite, according to CNN coverage cited in Adobe's report. The campaign used ancient tie-dyeing techniques and documented the work with Indian photographer Bharat Sikka.

Corona's ""Impossible Plants"" campaign in Japan addressed widespread vitamin D deficiency by encouraging sun exposure through imagery of plants sprouting through concrete, according to Muse by Clios coverage referenced in the forecast.

Visual discovery platforms like Pinterest introduced tools throughout 2025 enabling localized creative production. Pinterest announced AI-powered auto-collages in June 2025, transforming product catalogs into culturally relevant visual content.

AI's expanding role in creative production

The report positioned artificial intelligence as an enabler rather than replacement for human creativity. Tor Myhren, Vice President of Marketing Communications at Apple, stated in Adobe's forecast: ""While AI is the most exciting creative tool we have seen in our lifetime, the human touch is our superpower and the path to long-term brand love.""

Adobe emphasized commercially safe AI foundations trained on proprietary brand content. The approach addresses intellectual property concerns affecting some generative AI implementations.

Research from WPP Media in September 2025 found 71% of industry experts view AI-produced creative content as likely by 2030, with 29% considering it highly likely. The shift represents the largest positive movement from baseline measurements across any scenario examined.

Adobe's research cited in the trends report indicated 99% of Fortune 100 companies have used AI in Adobe applications. Nearly 90% of the company's top 50 enterprise accounts adopted AI-first innovations including GenStudio offerings.

Brands including The Coca-Cola Company, dentsu, The Estée Lauder Companies, Henkel, IBM, IPG Health, Lumen Technologies, Monks, The National Football League, Newell Brands, PepsiCo/Gatorade, Prudential Financial, Publicis Groupe, Qualcomm, Stagwell, and Tapestry have implemented Adobe's AI-powered systems, according to the report.

Adobe research indicated 62% of marketers surveyed experienced increased content production volume during the past year. Nearly two-thirds believe content demand will grow by at least five times between now and 2026.

Implementation considerations for marketing teams

Adobe's forecast provided practical guidance for applying each trend. The multisensory approach requires customizing brand colors, fonts, and textures while incorporating audio elements that complement visual content.

Emotional connection execution involves using collaborative AI-powered moodboards to spark new ideas within teams. Quick design tools can transform rough concepts into polished deliverables within minutes.

Surreal design implementation leverages diverse ecosystems of Adobe Firefly and partner models, providing choice and flexibility. Advertisers can maintain brand consistency while exploring imaginative creative territories through customized look-and-feel kits.

Local authenticity requires content localization to accommodate language and visual preferences regionally. Template customization enables adaptation while preserving core brand identity.

The report emphasized that successful implementation requires understanding authentic local voices rather than imposing external interpretations. When brands cannot physically access specific locations, collaboration with local talent becomes essential.

Marketing technology developments throughout 2025 demonstrated AI's transformation of customer engagement. Smartly's November 2025 research showed 92% of surveyed marketers reporting AI fundamentally redefines consumer connections.

Industry context and competitive landscape

Adobe's trends report arrives during significant advertising industry transformation. Global advertising spending reached $1.14 trillion in 2025, with commerce advertising surpassing television for the first time at $178.2 billion, according to WPP Media projections.

The creative production challenge intensifies as platforms demand increasing content variations. Facebook's advertising algorithms require minimum ten versions of ad images to optimize performance for specific users, demonstrating the scale of creative variation needed.

Brazilian agency GALERIA.ag announced in July 2025 a partnership committing R$10 million to Adobe GenStudio implementation. Adobe data cited in that announcement indicated GenStudio optimization delivers up to 70% reduction in go-to-market time for campaigns while centralizing asset management.

Industry research on AI adoption revealed cautious optimism among media professionals. Integral Ad Science's December 2025 report showed 61% of surveyed media experts expressed excitement about AI developments while 53% simultaneously cited unsuitable adjacencies as a top 2026 challenge.

The convergence of increasing content demands with expanding AI capabilities creates both opportunities and challenges. Adobe positioned its trends forecast as guidance for navigating this complexity while maintaining authentic human creativity.

Platform consolidation continues reshaping competitive dynamics. Google's advertising innovations and Meta's AI optimization systems demonstrate major platforms' commitment to automated creative production and optimization capabilities.

Market implications for creative professionals

The four trends identified by Adobe reflect broader shifts in consumer expectations and technological capabilities. Each trend addresses specific audience needs while leveraging AI tools to achieve scale impossible through manual production alone.

The multisensory approach responds to screen fatigue and desire for richer experiences. Emotional connection addresses automation anxiety by emphasizing human-centered storytelling. Surreal design provides entertainment value in attention-saturated environments. Local authenticity counters homogenization by celebrating cultural specificity.

Implementation requires balancing efficiency gains from AI automation with authentic human creativity that builds long-term brand relationships. The report emphasized that tools enable rather than replace creative talent.

Adobe provided curated collections, AI-powered moodboards, and customizable templates supporting each trend. These resources aim to accelerate adoption while maintaining creative quality standards.

The forecast aligns with broader industry predictions for 2026, which identified agentic AI, privacy-first identity infrastructure, and owned channel transformation as dominant themes reshaping marketing operations.

NewsNation's implementation of Adobe Express demonstrated practical applications of creative automation. The broadcaster reduced production time from hours to minutes using Adobe's tools, according to case study materials referenced in the trends report.

The creative trends forecast positions 2026 as a year where innovation and authenticity coexist rather than compete. Adobe emphasized that successful execution requires understanding both technological capabilities and enduring human creative principles.

The high three-year median payout ratio of 87% (that is, the company retains only 13% of its income) over the past three years for Medtronic suggests that the company's earnings growth was lower as a result of paying out a majority of its earnings.

In addition, Medtronic has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 47% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 16% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.

Summary

Overall, we would be extremely cautious before making any decision on Medtronic.

We recently published 10 Firms in the Limelight. Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) is one of the best performers on Friday.

Rocket Lab rallied for a second day on Friday, surging 17.69 percent to close at $70.52 apiece after bagging a potential billion-dollar contract to develop and produce satellites for the US Space Development Agency.

Touted as its largest single contract to date, Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) said that the partnership includes an $806 million base contract, $10.45 million in options, and opportunities for the supply of other items.

Under the base contract, Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) would manufacture 18 satellites equipped with advanced missile warning, tracking, and defense sensors to provide global, persistent detection and tracking of emerging missile threats, including hypersonic systems.

Each satellite will feature its Phoenix infrared sensor payload, a wide field-of-view (WFOV) solution designed to meet the evolving missile defense needs of national security space, as well as advanced StarLite space protection sensors, designed to safeguard the constellation against directed energy threats.

Meanwhile, it would also supply items such as payloads, solar solutions, attitude determination and control components (ACDS), software, among others.

The contract forms part of the Tracking Layer Tranche 3 (TRKT3) program under the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA).

“Demand for resilient, scalable, and affordable space systems continues to grow, and this award demonstrates that Rocket Lab is uniquely positioned to lead the charge in delivering solutions that meet the needs of national security,” said Rocket Lab Corporation (NASDAQ:RKLB) CEO Peter Beck.

The fast-fashion giant is now using AI to tweak images of real models, showing them in different outfits without having to reshoot everything again and again.
Together, these moves show how fashion brands are turning to tech to keep up with the industry’s relentless pace.
Isabelle Doran, CEO of the Association of Photographers in London, has warned that wider use of AI could reduce how often photographers, models, and production teams are hired.
Advt As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder.","Zara has quietly joined the growing list of fashion brands experimenting with artificial intelligence, and it’s already stirring conversation. The fast-fashion giant is now using AI to tweak images of real models, showing them in different outfits without having to reshoot everything again and again. The goal is pretty straightforward: faster visuals, fewer shoots, and quicker rollouts. But it also signals a bigger change in how fashion imagery is being made.

Zara isn’t alone in this. Earlier this year, H&M revealed it had created AI-generated versions of models for its marketing work, and Zalando has been using similar tools to speed up campaign production. Together, these moves show how fashion brands are turning to tech to keep up with the industry’s relentless pace.

Advt

Zara’s parent company, Inditex, has been quick to clarify that AI isn’t here to replace humans. “We are using artificial intelligence only to complement our existing processes,” a company spokesperson said. They added that models are kept in the loop, their consent is taken before any AI edits are made, and payments follow industry standards.

The details first came out through a report by London-based outlet CityAM. According to the report, a model said Zara asked for approval before using AI to digitally show them wearing different outfits. The model also shared that they were paid the same amount they would have earned if they had travelled for another shoot, which suggests brands are trying to tread carefully, at least for now.

H&M and Zalando have made similar statements, saying AI is meant to support creative teams, not replace them. Photographers, stylists, makeup artists, and production crews are still part of the process, even if technology helps brands work faster and cut costs behind the scenes.

What makes Zara’s move especially interesting is that Inditex chair Marta Ortega is known to be a big supporter of fashion photography. The daughter of Zara founder Amancio Ortega has often spoken about her love for the art form. Since 2021, her MOP Foundation gallery in A Coruña, the Spanish city where Zara began, has hosted exhibitions celebrating legendary photographers.

Advt

Right now, the gallery is showing Annie Leibovitz’s work, and previous exhibitions have highlighted names like Steven Meisel, a long-time Zara collaborator, and Helmut Newton. At the same time, Ortega has been pushing Zara towards a more premium feel, shutting down smaller stores and focusing on larger, more polished flagship spaces.

Still, not everyone is convinced this AI shift is harmless. Isabelle Doran, CEO of the Association of Photographers in London, has warned that wider use of AI could reduce how often photographers, models, and production teams are hired. Her concern is that this won’t just affect big names in the industry, but also young creatives trying to get their first break.

Advt

As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder. And for now, the industry is still figuring out where exactly the line should be drawn.

Whether the plan requires a veto, in Johnson’s eyes, is the question of the hour.
Should Johnson follow through, he would be the first Chicago mayor to veto a budget plan since 1985, when Mayor Harold Washington rejected a revenue package approved by a majority bloc of aldermen.
And Johnson meanwhile introduced a revised budget plan of his own Friday that would replace the debt sale plan with the head tax.
But some holdouts are also reluctant to approve Johnson’s borrowing plan to cover firefighter backpay and police misconduct settlement costs.","The budget counterproposal crafted by opponents of Mayor Brandon Johnson won a critical first full City Council vote Friday, setting up the mayor to soon concede their remarkable weekslong fight — or issue Chicago’s first mayoral veto of a budget in decades.

Aldermen voted 29-19 to approve the revenue piece of an alternative 2026 spending plan that does not include Johnson’s corporate head tax. That’s shy of the 34-vote threshold needed to override a potential mayoral veto, however, leaving the door open for the City Hall standoff to escalate further still. And with under two weeks until an end-of-year deadline to approve a budget, all factions agree Chicago is inching too close for comfort to a government shutdown.

When the moment came Friday, aldermen debated for mere moments before quickly passing the plan.

“The city of Chicago’s financial position is at a critical juncture,” said Ald. Pat Dowell, Johnson’s handpicked Finance chair who played a critical role in the effort that outmuscled him. “And I think we have emerged today with a budget plan that protects programs which are vital to those most in need while setting on the right path toward a stronger fiscal future.”

The $16.6 billion aldermanic package contains a debt sale measure that Johnson has called Thursday “morally bankrupt” and his “red line.” His budget team warned such a novel proposal should not be counted on to raise any money at all, on top of attacking other components of the alternative budget that they argue is unbalanced and would require midyear amendments next year.

Whether the plan requires a veto, in Johnson’s eyes, is the question of the hour.

The rest of the budget package could face a vote as soon as Saturday. But in his post-council presser, the mayor sought to pump the brakes by insisting “negotiations are still prevalent. This process is not over just yet.”

“I haven’t made that decision yet,” Johnson said about a possible veto.

Johnson adviser Kennedy Bartley told reporters after the news conference that the administration believes the mayor would be able to make line item vetoes in key budget legislation, a sign he is weighing such a possibility.

Should Johnson follow through, he would be the first Chicago mayor to veto a budget plan since 1985, when Mayor Harold Washington rejected a revenue package approved by a majority bloc of aldermen. Johnson first threatened a mayoral veto last month on any budget that hikes property taxes or garbage fees but has been less committal about his council rivals’ current plan.

But he also took pains in his news conference Friday to try to frame the revenue package aldermen passed as a compromise, despite the fact the council has so far rejected his key corporate head tax provision and instead embraced the debt sale he has railed against.

He pointed to the increased and new taxes on leased personal property and social media companies to argue the passed plan pulls from businesses.

The mayor has also taken credit for his aldermanic opponents backing off a plan to increase garbage fees.“These are gains that, had we not put forth this fight, they would not exist,” he said.

And Johnson meanwhile introduced a revised budget plan of his own Friday that would replace the debt sale plan with the head tax. In the plan, the city would make a full advance pension payment Johnson had earlier proposed halving, not legalize video gambling terminals and count on slot machines being placed at a Midway Airport lounge.

Aldermen opposed to Johnson used a legislative maneuver to delay consideration of the mayor’s tweaked proposal.

Johnson’s head tax idea remains at a monthly $33-per-employee surcharge for companies over 500 workers in his latest ordinance, even after a majority of aldermen have repeatedly rejected versions of the levy in votes and letters. But the mayor on Friday refused to move on, comparing his fight to tax corporations to crusades for racial justice, gender equality and suffrage movements throughout American history.

“That fight is not over. Do you know how many times people fought for civil rights, women’s rights, the rights to vote?” Johnson said when asked why he won’t accept defeat. “Wouldn’t that have been a shame if we would have had that same question for people a generation ago? That you’ve lost it, why not give up?”

The mayor and his leftist allies have been admonishing the majority council bloc for weeks, say they are siding with rich corporations and billionaires. The war of words has also stood out from other budget fights in its campaign-style messaging from outside interests, pitting wealthy business-backed groups against the Johnson-allied Chicago Teachers Union and other progressive organizations.

But even the progressives were not united with Johnson, who first introduced his own $16.6 billion package in October but failed to make the case that his pitch to reinstate the city’s head tax, among other new revenue measures, was Chicago’s best hope to stand up to President Donald Trump. That his aldermanic rivals gained such ground over Johnson was not just because of his focus on the head tax but because they championed a full advance pension payment from the start.

That’s a requirement for many council members who say Chicago must stop kicking the can down the road with its fiscal obligations — or else risk a catastrophic credit downgrade. But some holdouts are also reluctant to approve Johnson’s borrowing plan to cover firefighter backpay and police misconduct settlement costs. The council counterproposal preserves that part of Johnson’s budget.

On Friday, Progressive Caucus members Aldermen Desmon Yancy, Ronnie Mosley and Ruth Cruz voted with the mayor’s opposition, while Ald. Andre Vasquez abstained. He later said on the floor he would have voted no but encountered technical difficulties.

Though progressive Ald. Matt Martin voted against the rival revenue package, he stressed that was because he wants to leverage both sides to nix the borrowing plan to pay for firefighter backpay and police settlements. Like his colleagues, he agreed a government shutdown “is the worst outcome, and that’s not going to happen.”

Asked if relations between the mayor’s office on the fifth floor and City Council had any hope of improving given that doomsday scenario, he took a long pause before saying, “I don’t know, honestly. I don’t know.”

Yancy, meanwhile, answered, “I guess the question is ‘Better than what?’ Right? The last couple of years has been really difficult. I think that has shown up in the way this budget conversation has gone.”

For his part Ald. Jason Ervin, Johnson’s pick to lead the powerful Budget Committee, argued afterward the vote did not signify an end to negotiations.

“I think that once the temperature dies down, folks go home for Christmas, take their pictures in their onesies and come back, I think we have a better result,” he said.

Asked if he believes the mayor should reject the spending plan he has criticized as unbalanced, he said “there are elements of it that should be vetoed.”

Outside chambers, Johnson’s empowered foes took a muted victory lap, with Ald. Brendan Reilly claiming the coalition was “awfully close” to winning over a veto-proof bloc of the council.

Dowell said that discussions should continue, as “a budget is a living document. It is a document that can be changed and modified, and if there are opportunities to do that or need to do that, we will.” She and her colleagues also disagreed with the mayor’s harsh rhetoric of that document.

“I don’t know what ‘morally bankrupt’ means,” Dowell said about Johnson’s ongoing criticism of their debt sale idea. “If you can explain that to me, I’ll answer the question.”

That Johnson’s third budget fight has gotten this combative shows how much the freshman mayor has lost control of the City Council. But Johnson himself may have inadvertently seen this coming months ago.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ctc-l-city-council-budget-1.jpg?w=1024&h=664,N,,2025-12-20 13:00:25.715226

Фінальна мораль банальна і сто разів пережована: багатим теж несолодко, гроші руйнують їхній звʼязок з реальністю і з близькими.","Скандал, що лежить в основі подій фільму, свого часу прогримів на всю Європу. Головна акціонерка косметичної мегакорпорації L'Oréal Ліліан Беттанкур, чиї статки сягали майже 40 млрд доларів США, дійсно була найбагатшою жінкою світу. У 1987 році Беттанкур познайомилася з письменником, художником, світлиняром, відкритим ґеєм Франсуа-Марі Баньє, коли він фотографував її для французького журналу Égoiste. Вони стали дуже близькими друзями, по суті, платонічними коханцями — разом виходили у світ, розважались, подорожували.

Ліліан засипала Франсуа-Марі дуже коштовними подарунками (картини Пікассо, Матісса, Мондріана, Делоне і Леже, поліс страхування життя на суму € 253 млн — сума витрат склала € 1,3 млрд), навіть хотіла всиновити його. Дочка Ліліан, Франсуаза, яку вже давно непокоїв цей звʼязок, у 2007 році подала позов проти Баньє, звинувативши його в експлуатації фізичної або психологічної слабкості з метою особистої вигоди. Після розслідування і допитів справу передали до суду. Баньє засудили до двох з половиною років позбавлення волі та зобов'язали виплатити Ліліан 158 мільйонів євро як відшкодування збитків. Франсуа подав апеляцію. Другий судовий розгляд підтвердив вирок, але зупинив виконання тюремного ув'язнення та скасував відшкодування.

Режисер Тьєррі Кліф і його співсценаристи Седрік Анжер і Жак Фієскі змінили імена, але не обставини. Ліліан Беттанкур стала Маріанною Фаррер (Ізабель Юппер), Франсуа-Марі — П'єром-Аленом (Лоран Лафітт), Франсуаза — Фредерікою (Марина Фуа). Пролог тривожний: поліція проводить обшук у маєтку Фаррер, П'єра-Алена затримано, господиня спантеличена. Після цього режисер відступає в часі, аби показати, як поважна бізнес-леді дійшла до такого життя.

Цікаво, що на Netflix позаторік вийшов документальний мінісеріал про справу Беттанкур: «Мільярдерка, дворецький і бойфренд» (The Billionaire, the Butler and the Boyfriend). У ньому частину сцен проілюстровано ігровими реконструкціями за участю акторів. Тьєррі Кліф діє симетрично: вставляє в сюжет стилізовані під документальну зйомку інтервʼю з головними дійовими особами, що пригадують, як усе було. Щоправда, драматургічно це нічим не обумовлено: ЗМІ, медіа чи якась документалістська група в сюжеті не представлені. Здається, що режисер зробив ці «інтерв’ю», просто щоб переказати ті частини сюжету, які не вмістилися в основну історію. Загалом це, мабуть, головна біда фільму: в ньому багато слів, чимало персонажів, але повідомляє він недостатньо.

Юппер грає звичний для неї типаж жорсткої, уїдливої, зарозумілої героїні. Лоран Лафітт блискуче відпрацьовує таку собі комбінацію Тартюфа і Трумена Капоте, як його побачив Гас Ван Сент у серіалі «Капоте проти лебедів» (2024). Його П'єр-Ален — веселий цинік, зухвалий трикстер, чарівний у своєму нахабстві, артистично-безцеремонний. Його гасло — «Сміливим бути краще». Він вміло комбінує маскулінний натиск і жіночну кокетливість. Лафітт з Юппер створюють яскраву хімію між персонажами, і це, мабуть, найкраща частина фільму — єдина, правду кажучи, яка не викликає запитань.

А запитання є. Зрозуміло, чим П'єр-Ален приваблює Маріанну, але важливіше те, чому в неї взагалі виникла потреба в ньому. Що не так у її шлюбі? Чи надламав її тягар наступництва в бізнес-імперії? Чому вона настільки холодна і відсторонена з дочкою? Яку роль у цьому всьому зіграли пронацистські симпатії її батька, якого вона обожнювала? Відповіді, що визначають мотивації героїв, є у вищезазначеному серіалі Netflix, але не у фільмі.

І з цього випливає прикра драматична змазаність «Найбагатшої жінки світу». Юппер практично не змінюється, що б не відбувалося: на її обличчі не читається ані розгубленість, ані лють, ані умиротворення. Емоційні півтони заміщуються мелодраматичними прийомами (чого лише варта сцена в нічному клубі, коли знайома П'єра-Алена співає сльозливий шансон). Фінальна мораль банальна і сто разів пережована: багатим теж несолодко, гроші руйнують їхній звʼязок з реальністю і з близькими.

Але нащо було заради такого набору очевидностей витрачати аж дві години екранного часу?",https://i.lb.ua/119/53/694514e970bb9.jpeg,N,,2025-12-20 11:03:07.070402

He died of old age complications at 10:35 am on Saturday, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR). He was 95 years (Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un).

AK Khandker, deputy chief of staff of the Mukti Bahini during the Liberation War, was the first chief of the Bangladesh Air Force.

The former Air Vice Marshal later entered politics and served as a minister on two occasions.

AK Khandker was born in 1930 in Rangpur, where his father was posted for work.

His ancestral home was in Puran varenga village of Bera Upazila in Pabna District. He passed his matriculation examination in 1947 and his higher secondary examination in 1949.

In 1952, he was commissioned into the Pakistan Air Force. As a group captain, he joined the Bangladesh War of Liberation and was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Mukti Bahini.

Immediately prior to the Liberation War, he was the second-in-command of the Pakistan Air Force in East Pakistan.

He later left that position and joined the War of Liberation.

On 16 December 1971, at the historic moment of the surrender of the Pakistani forces at the Racecourse Ground in Dhaka, he was present as a representative of the Mukti Bahini.

After independence, he was appointed the first chief of the Bangladesh Air Force and under his leadership the war-ravaged Air Force was reorganised and rebuilt. He served as Air Force chief until 1975.

In recognition of his outstanding contributions to Bangladesh’s War of Liberation, AK Khandker was awarded the gallantry title of Bir Uttam in 1973 and the Independence Award in 2011. He also served as president of the Sector Commanders’ Forum.

AK Khandker first served as a minister in the government of HM Ershad. Later, after being elected a member of parliament from the Awami League in 2008, he again held ministerial office.

The Coastguard initiated the Anstruther RNLI pagers at 9.48pm and requested the launch of the Anster lifeboat.
The large fishing vessel was continuing to take on water and there was significant concern that the boat could sink, with an estimated 2000 litres of fuel onboard.
The Anstruther RNLI crew were able to leave the incident by 1.15am and were back in Anstruther Harbour by 1.35am.

The Coastguard initiated the Anstruther RNLI pagers at 9.48pm and requested the launch of the Anster lifeboat.

However, at the time of the initial request there was no reported or assumed risk to life. Therefore, in accordance with RNLI policy, the Anstruther RNLI Duty Launch Authority declined the request and did not provide authority for the lifeboat to launch, as there was no risk to life.

The large fishing vessel was continuing to take on water and there was significant concern that the boat could sink, with an estimated 2000 litres of fuel onboard.

Further information was received from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service teams from Anstruther and St. Monans, who were in attendance at the scene, that a member of the public had boarded the sinking vessel in an attempt to shore up the cause of the leak, which now constituted a potential risk to life. Furthermore, the Scottish Fire and Rescue service were not equipped to board the vessel safely to rescue a casualty.

At 10.15pm the Coastguard again requested the launch of the Anstruther RNLI all-weather lifeboat and the Anster volunteer crew were able to launch immediately, as they had already assembled and were kitted out, prepped and briefed for an immediate launch to the incident.

By 10.27pm the Anster Shannon, with its volunteer crew of six aboard, were in the water and heading out in a rough sea, against a Force 6, South Westerly wind. The Anstruther RNLI lifeboat crew arrived on the scene at 10.43pm and liaised with both the Scottish Fire and Rescue Teams and the Coastguard Rescue Teams from St. Andrews and Leven, who had initiated a cordon around the harbour area.

It was established that the member of the public who had boarded the vessel had voluntarily disembarked safely from the sinking vessel and was now being supported by the emergency services in attendance.

There was no longer a risk to life, but the combined rescue teams in attendance were still faced with the prospect of a large fishing vessel taking on water, with 2000 litres of fuel onboard, which could have created an environmental spill if the fuel tanks flooded. It was jointly assessed by the RNLI Anstruther Coxswain, Michael Bruce, and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service that the Anstruther RNLI volunteer crew would board the vessel and use their combined pumps to keep the vessel afloat and attempt to shore up the cause of the leak to prevent the fishing boat sinking.

By 12.32am the fishing vessel had been emptied of water, with the leak temporarily plugged and it was assessed as being made safe for a later inspection and repair. The Anstruther RNLI crew were able to leave the incident by 1.15am and were back in Anstruther Harbour by 1.35am.

However, due to the state of the tides it was not possible to conduct a high-water recovery of the all-weather lifeboat, so the lifeboat was moored up on the pier. The tides enabled the lifeboat to be recovered and rehoused by 3am; however, when considering the work commitments of the volunteer boat and shore crew it was decided to leave the Anstruther Shannon afloat, but still on stand-by, until a planned recovery and rehouse at 8am.

Michael Bruce, Coxswain for Anstruther’s RNLI Lifeboat, said: ‘Fortunately, the member of the public who boarded the unsafe fishing vessel managed to get themselves to safety, without the incident developing into a rescue, or worse.

‘The RNLI will always launch and respond where there is a potential risk to life, but we urge members of the public to not place themselves at risk, despite how well intentioned they are, but to leave incidents like this to the Emergency Services, who will seek support from the RNLI if the situation warrants our involvement.

‘If you are intending to spend the festive period on, or near the water, please enjoy yourselves safely, but make sure you take notice of published tide times, the weather forecast and any warning and information signs at the location.

‘The RNLI, alongside our colleagues in the Emergency Services will remain on standby 24/7 throughout the Festive and Hogmanay period in support of our local coastal community and visitors.’

Strategic Push: Confluent Acquisition Bolsters AI Ambitions IBM's strategic direction continues to emphasize the expansion of its AI and data platforms.","A fresh analyst downgrade is applying pressure to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) shares, shifting investor focus squarely onto valuation concerns. This comes despite the technology giant reporting robust quarterly results and aggressively advancing its artificial intelligence strategy through multi-billion dollar acquisitions.

The company's strong operational foundation was highlighted in its third-quarter 2025 report, where it surpassed market expectations. Earnings per share (EPS) reached $2.65, outperforming the consensus forecast of $2.45. Revenue totaled $16.33 billion, exceeding estimates of $16.10 billion and representing a year-over-year growth rate of 9.1%. A key metric, IBM's AI-related ""book of business,"" now stands at over $9.5 billion.

Bolstered by this performance, management raised its full-year outlook. The company now targets constant-currency revenue growth exceeding 5% and has increased its projected free cash flow to approximately $14 billion.

Downgrade Highlights Valuation Skepticism

Against this backdrop of operational strength, Wall Street Zen revised its rating on IBM shares from ""Buy"" to ""Hold"" on December 20, 2025. The firm cited increasing skepticism regarding the stock's valuation and its future growth trajectory. This move underscores a growing debate on Wall Street about whether the company's current share price already reflects its positive momentum.

The overall analyst consensus remains favorable but is not unanimous. The average rating stands at ""Moderate Buy,"" with a mean price target of $293.38. The distribution of recommendations reveals a mixed field:

* 1 ""Strong Buy""

* 9 ""Buy""

* 6 ""Hold""

* 1 ""Sell"" (UBS Group)

Diverging views are evident. Stifel maintained its ""Buy"" recommendation and raised its price target from $295 to $325 on December 9. In contrast, Sanford C. Bernstein reiterated a ""market perform"" rating on December 10. This spectrum of opinion suggests that while IBM's business execution is convincing, the entry point for new investors is becoming a more cautious consideration.

Premium Multiples Under Scrutiny

Valuation metrics are now a central focus. IBM currently trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 36.0 and a PEG ratio of 2.99. These multiples position the stock notably above the industry average for ""Computer-Integrated Systems,"" where the forward P/E ratio sits at 24.95.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

This premium is the core reason for the emerging analyst hesitation. A sustained higher valuation multiple requires correspondingly accelerated growth to justify it. The recent downgrade reflects a concern that the stock may have already priced in much of the company's recent positive news.

Market reaction has been measured so far. Shares closed at 257.85 euros on Friday, representing a solid year-to-date gain of over 20%. However, this price remains roughly 5% below the stock's 52-week high.

Strategic Push: Confluent Acquisition Bolsters AI Ambitions

IBM's strategic direction continues to emphasize the expansion of its AI and data platforms. On December 8, the company announced a major move in this arena: the acquisition of Confluent for approximately $11 billion. The goal is to construct an enterprise-grade ""Smart Data Platform"" tailored for generative AI applications.

This purchase aims to solidify IBM's standing in the competitive and investment-heavy AI infrastructure market. It follows a series of other AI initiatives, including partnerships with Anthropic and Grok, designed to enhance the capabilities of the Watson-X platform.

For shareholders, the message is clear: IBM is willing to commit significant capital to build out its AI ecosystem. While this is intended to drive long-term growth, it also intensifies short-term questions about valuation and integration.

Conclusion: Robust Story Meets Price Sensitivity

In summary, IBM operates from a position of fundamental strength, evidenced by its Q3 beat, raised guidance, and a clearly articulated AI strategy punctuated by the major Confluent deal. Nevertheless, the spotlight has turned to the stock's price.

The sustainability of its current elevated valuation will largely depend on IBM's ability to deliver on its higher growth targets within the AI segment and for total revenue in coming quarters. Investors will also be watching closely for tangible synergies to emerge from the integration of Confluent.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2411716_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 07:59:29.103786

The company said on Friday that it will train 5 million learners in the country by 2030 in frontier technologies such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and quantum computing. The initiative is part of its plan to build a future-ready workforce and expand access to digital skills.

The skilling effort will be delivered through IBM’s ‘SkillsBuild’ programme. The company said the aim is to support both students and adult learners with training that matches the demands of emerging industries.

The focus will be on employability and developing practical skills that help people enter the technology workforce.

AI, QUANTUM AND CYBERSECURITY TRAINING TO SHAPE INDIA'S NEXT TECH WORKFORCE

IBM said it will expand its education outreach across schools, colleges and vocational institutions. A key part of the initiative is a collaboration with the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).

Through this partnership, IBM plans to introduce hands-on learning pathways in AI and other technologies. It will also offer faculty training programmes, hackathons and internship opportunities.

The company’s target for India is part of a wider global mission. IBM aims to train 30 million people worldwide by 2030. The India programme will form one of the largest national components of that goal.

Education experts say the need for such skilling programmes has increased as companies demand workers who understand AI systems, data models, security tools and automation.

India’s rapid digital expansion has further pushed the need for a trained workforce that can adapt to changing technologies.

With this initiative, IBM joins a growing list of global technology companies investing in skilling programmes in India. The company said that by working with institutions and government bodies, it hopes to reach learners across different regions and economic backgrounds.

The IBM SkillsBuild programme already has a presence in several Indian states.

The expanded plan will cover more campuses and community-level centres, allowing learners to access free courses, certifications and project-based modules.

As India looks to strengthen its digital economy, the coming years will test how effectively such mass skilling efforts can translate into job opportunities and industry-ready talent. IBM’s long-term target signals a belief that the next wave of technological leadership will depend on how well countries prepare their workforce today.

I wish I could say I was surprised by DOGE — which for me was the full culmination of the long-simmering libertarian basis of the Silicon Valley worldview being enacted at scale by the federal government.","A tech worker turned art critic, Mike Pepi has carefully chronicled how Silicon Valley’s true evolution since the dot-com era has been defined not by the development of new digital tools, but rather by a fundamental rethinking about how society should be structured. His latest book, Against Platforms: Surviving Digital Utopia, traces the downfall of the egalitarian ideals from the earliest days of the internet. Pepi talks to us about his proposal for a Slop Tax, and why the pursuit of artificial general intelligence is doomed. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What’s one underrated big idea?

That nothing is inevitable. I’m starting to see this more in the critique of Silicon Valley and their deployment of technology. “Technology” itself, as a standalone term, is a misnomer. It’s always about its design and deployment by people, and people are political animals: they use institutions and have and cede power. The Silicon Valley techno-determinists want you to think that “technology” is on an inevitable march, but this is just a total fiction unraveling before our eyes.

DIGITAL FUTURE DAILY readers: We want to hear from you! What do you like in your afternoon tech newsletter? What do you want more of? Please take a few minutes and fill out this survey.

What’s a technology you think is overhyped?

AGI, and to a larger extent AI in general. Not only is it simply statistically likely output — math that basically just guesses at response — the implementations of it are coming back down to reality. In the office, it’s sowing chaos and most AI projects blow up, and in terms of its “creative applications,” we’re seeing mostly slop produced by some of the least interesting people on earth.

In 10 years’ time, we’ll look back on AI as an extremely overhyped homework help tool. As for AGI, where do we start? Even the most frontier models continually hallucinate, and worse, they lack context about tasks that only humans can provide. AGI is basically religion for a very small minority of people; on the other hand, it’s a myth manufactured by Silicon Valley to rationalize increased investment and to stoke fear into anyone who seems semi-critical of the increasing encroachment of AI in everyday life.

What could the government be doing regarding technology that it isn’t?

Taxing AI companies and platforms that produce and host AI slop, and redistribute that money to sustain the institutions and creators that AI has stolen from. I call it the Slop Tax and I’ve drafted a whitepaper to advocate for this policy. We are looking for groups to pilot this with.

What book most shaped your conception of the future?

Imaginary Futures: From Thinking Machines to the Global Village by Richard Barbrook. Not only does this book provide a handy history of digital utopianism, [but] the thing that struck me most about [it] is just how often the history of 20th-century technology involves its boosters describing the potential benefits of a tool far before that capability is a reality. Then, once the tech arrives, the utopian ground has already been seeded, and a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy takes hold.

What has surprised you the most this year?

I wish I could say I was surprised by DOGE — which for me was the full culmination of the long-simmering libertarian basis of the Silicon Valley worldview being enacted at scale by the federal government. I could not have predicted, however, the brazenness. The way that [Elon] Musk sold this was also concerning, as it tapped into the very American strain of small-government ideology, though this time with a heavy layer of a vague AI-inflected anti-humanism.

I take heart that the entire thing failed, and that it led to a kind of counter-revolution in which everyday citizens now realize the full extent to which so many government institutions and federal funds ensure our most basic necessities.

Democrats go hard on Instacart

Democratic senators want the Federal Trade Commission to exert pressure on Instacart.

Seven senators sent a letter to FTC Andrew Ferguson, which was first shared with POLITICO’s Morning Tech team, urging him to launch an investigation into its alleged use of dynamic pricing — the practice of continuously changing prices based on fluctuations in demand or the time of day.

The senators cite a report by the Groundwork Collaborative, Consumer Reports and More Perfect Union suggesting that Instacart has experimented with using AI to determine food prices. As the letter, helmed by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), reads: “We are deeply concerned that Instacart’s pricing tactics may result in higher food prices, less competition, fewer opportunities to comparison shop, more incentive for companies to collect sensitive personal data, and increased customer confusion[.]”

Another stab at national privacy rules

Republican House members are gearing up to introduce data privacy legislation as early as January, POLITICO’s Gabby Miller was the first to report.

The House Energy and Commerce Committee is putting the final touches on a law that would protect consumers’ data. If passed, the law would likely preempt state statutes on data protection, and finally end Congress’s protracted quest to establish a national privacy framework.

“There’s a consensus standard composed of, I would say, the majority of the states that would try to kind of conglomerate them all together,” Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-Calif.), a member of the the committee’s all-Republican data privacy working group, told Gabby. “I think people aren’t going to be surprised, it’s a lot of ideas that have been tried successfully elsewhere, which the states are supposed to be the laboratories of democracy.”

But a user under the name @Kakashii posted on X December 7 disputing the claims, a thread Burry chose to amplify and double down on.

Claims of Inconsistent Numbers

Kakashii explained the calculations he performed to confirm Huang’s statements.

“Since Blackwell is out, Nvidia reported 111B in revenue in GPU datacenters,” he wrote. “If you do simple math, 6 million Blackwell GPUs within the reported 111B revenue of datacenters since Blackwell started to ship is not matching, because it represents only between 2.5 to 3.5 million Blackwell chips.”

Even when giving Huang the benefit of the doubt and assuming he is “always telling the truth,” @Kakashii said, the numbers track for just four million units. He claims millions are unaccounted for.

He concluded that the claim is inconsistent with Nvidia’s reported revenue and with data center power capacity. So, the question would be that if a large portion of Nvidia Blackwell GPUs aren’t being used in data centers, as the thread claims, where are they?

Nvidia’s announcement with Nokia mostly focused on using GPUs at the base of wireless towers to run both radio access network (or, RAN) applications alongside AI workloads. But while Nvidia seems eager to tap into this new market, there are a few problems.

First, there are a ton of questions about whether the use case Nvidia is targeting even requires GPUs. And second? AI-RAN isn’t just one thing. And plenty of AI-RAN workloads are running today on existing hardware – that is, on CPUs.

It’s a bit complicated, but with a player as big as Nvidia shining a spotlight on the topic, it’s worth taking a deep dive to really understand what’s happening in this space.

With help from Orange’s Director of Innovation in Radio & Environment Atoosa Hatefi and Dell’Oro Group’s Stefan Pongratz we’ll dig into the different flavors of AI-RAN, what would compel telecom operators to spring for GPUs and what the overall market forecast looks like.

Speaking in a recently released episode of ""On with Kara Swisher"" podcast, Khosrowshahi said that while tech CEOs might see AI making their engineers less productive, he has a different point of view. ""I just think they become superhumans,"" he said. ""So we are actually hiring more engineers because every engineer got more valuable to me,"" he added. Khosrowshahi further revealed that around 80% to 90% of Uber's developers now use AI tools. This, he said, has done away with the need to keep scores of engineers on call to fix issues, and have them spend ""hours and hours"" figuring out what's gone wrong and where. Instead, AI agents are ""constantly looking at all of our systems"" and helping to diagnose problems, he said. ""And then the human can look over the shoulder of the AI agent,"" Khosrowshahi added. Describing his mobility, delivery, and freight company as an ""applied AI"" business, Khosrowshahi said that Uber is harnessing the tech for everything – from setting prices and payments to matching, routing, identification, and dealing with customer complaints.

During the podcast, Khosrowshahi also touched upon topics such as the AI bubble. He said that while AI stocks may look frothy, but Uber's embrace of the technology is transforming its operations and yielding huge financial benefits. “You can debate whether or not there's a bubble in terms of valuation,” he said adding “The spending on the data centers, etc., is massive.” Khosrowshahi also revealed that the AI has created a lot of value for Uber, ""not in the space-age stuff"" but in ""very practical"" ways. He also gave examples of the practical usage of AI for Uber which included “determining what's shown next to a customer on their Uber Eats app after they select a carton of oat milk. ” He said that the latest AI models are ""enormously more effective"" than previous ones, and are producing ""hundreds of millions of dollars of benefit to us"". Uber's AI spend ""has been well worth it and then some,"" he said. ""We are not building the picks and shovels but we're riding on top of that spend, absolutely.”

$5,000,000 Barclays Bank PLC Trigger Callable Yield Notes

Linked to the lesser performing of the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index due March 22, 2027

Investment Description

The Trigger Callable Yield Notes (the “Notes”) are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations issued by Barclays Bank PLC (the “Issuer”) linked to the lesser performing of the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index (each an “Underlying” and together the “Underlyings”). On a monthly basis, unless the Notes have been previously called, the Issuer will pay you a coupon (the “Monthly Coupon”) on each Coupon Payment Date regardless of the performance of either Underlying. The Issuer may, at its election, call the Notes on any monthly Optional Call Notice Date, beginning on March 17, 2026, regardless of the Closing Level of either Underlying on that Optional Call Notice Date. If the Issuer elects to call the Notes prior to maturity, the Issuer will pay the principal amount of your Notes plus the Monthly Coupon due on the Coupon Payment Date that is also the Call Settlement Date, and no further amounts will be owed to you under the Notes. If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes prior to maturity and the Closing Level of each Underlying on the Final Valuation Date (the “Final Underlying Level”) is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold, the Issuer will pay you a cash payment at maturity equal to the principal amount of your Notes plus the final Monthly Coupon. However, if the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, at maturity, the Issuer will pay the final Monthly Coupon, but will repay less than the principal amount, if anything, resulting in a percentage loss of principal equal to the negative Underlying Return of the Underlying with the lower Underlying Return (the “Lesser Performing Underlying”). In this case, you will have full downside exposure to the Lesser Performing Underlying from its Initial Underlying Level to its Final Underlying Level, and could lose all of your principal. Investing in the Notes involves significant risks. You may lose a significant portion or all of your principal. You will be exposed to the market risk of each Underlying and any decline in the level of one Underlying may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the level of the other Underlying. The Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is observed relative to its Downside Threshold only on the Final Valuation Date, and the contingent repayment of principal applies only if you hold the Notes to maturity. Generally, the higher the Coupon Rate on a Note, the greater the risk of loss on that Note. Your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Monthly Coupons paid on the Notes until maturity or earlier call, and you will not participate in any appreciation of either Underlying. Any payment on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party. If Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its payment obligations or become subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power (as described on page PS-4 of this pricing supplement) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, you might not receive any amounts owed to you under the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement and “Risk Factors” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

NOTICE TO INVESTORS: THE NOTES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY RISKIER THAN CONVENTIONAL DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THE ISSUER IS NOT NECESSARILY OBLIGATED TO REPAY THE FULL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES AT MATURITY, AND THE NOTES CAN HAVE THE FULL DOWNSIDE MARKET RISK OF THE LESSER PERFORMING UNDERLYING. THIS MARKET RISK IS IN ADDITION TO THE CREDIT RISK INHERENT IN PURCHASING A DEBT OBLIGATION OF BARCLAYS BANK PLC. YOU SHOULD NOT PURCHASE THE NOTES IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS INVOLVED IN INVESTING IN THE NOTES.

YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE RISKS DESCRIBED UNDER “KEY RISKS” BEGINNING ON PAGE PS-8 OF THIS PRICING SUPPLEMENT AND “RISK FACTORS” BEGINNING ON PAGE S-9 OF THE PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT BEFORE PURCHASING ANY NOTES.

Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Notes

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Trade Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Trade Date is less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes results from several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Trade Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Trade Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Trade Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the initial issue date of the Notes because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Key Risks” beginning on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement.

PS- 3

Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

Selected Purchase Considerations

The considerations identified above are not exhaustive. Whether or not the Notes are an appropriate investment for you will depend on your individual circumstances, and you should reach an investment decision only after you and your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors have carefully considered the appropriateness of an investment in the Notes in light of your particular circumstances. You should also review carefully the “Key Risks” beginning on page PS-8 of this pricing supplement and the “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the prospectus supplement for risks related to an investment in the Notes. For more information about the Underlyings, please see the sections titled “Russell 2000® Index” and “EURO STOXX 50® Index” below.

Final Terms1

Issuer: Barclays Bank PLC Principal Amount: $10 per Note (subject to minimum investment of 100 Notes) Term2: Approximately 1.25 years, unless called earlier at the election of the Issuer. See “Key Dates” on the cover of this pricing supplement.2 Reference Assets: The Russell 2000® Index (Bloomberg ticker symbol “RTY<Index>”) and the EURO STOXX 50® Index (Bloomberg ticker symbol “SX5E<Index>”) (each an “Underlying” and together the “Underlyings”) Issuer Call: The Issuer may elect to call the Notes on any monthly Optional Call Notice Date, beginning on March 17, 2026, regardless of the Closing Level of either Underlying on that Optional Call Notice Date. If the Notes are called, the Issuer will pay the principal amount of your Notes plus the Monthly Coupon due on the Coupon Payment Date that is also the Call Settlement Date, and no further amounts will be owed to you under the Notes. Optional Call Notice Dates: March 17, 2026, April 17, 2026, May 18, 2026, June 17, 2026, July 17, 2026, August 17, 2026, September 17, 2026, October 19, 2026, November 17, 2026, December 17, 2026, January 19, 2027 and February 17, 2027 Call Settlement Dates2: The Coupon Payment Date immediately following the applicable Optional Call Notice Date Monthly Coupon: The Monthly Coupon is a fixed amount payable monthly based on the per annum Coupon Rate, regardless of the performance of either Underlying, subject to an earlier call at the discretion of the Issuer. Coupon Rate: The Coupon Rate is 9.20% per annum. Accordingly, the Monthly Coupon payable on each Coupon Payment Date is equal to $0.0767 per Note. Coupon Payment Dates2: January 22, 2026, February 19, 2026, March 19, 2026, April 21, 2026, May 20, 2026, June 22, 2026, July 21, 2026, August 19, 2026, September 21, 2026, October 21, 2026, November 19, 2026, December 21, 2026, January 21, 2027, February 19, 2027 and the Maturity Date Payment at Maturity (per Note):

If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold, the Issuer will pay you a cash payment on the Maturity Date equal to $10 per Note plus the final Monthly Coupon.

If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, on the Maturity Date, the Issuer will pay you the final Monthly Coupon, but will repay less than your principal amount, resulting in a percentage loss of principal equal to the negative Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying. You will receive a cash payment on the Maturity Date per Note, calculated as follows:

[$10 × (1 + Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying)] + final Monthly Coupon

Accordingly, you may lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity, depending on how much the Lesser Performing Underlying declines, regardless of the performance of the other Underlying. Any payment on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party.

Underlying Return:

With respect to each Underlying:

Final Underlying Level – Initial Underlying Level

Initial Underlying Level

Lesser Performing Underlying: The Underlying with the lower Underlying Return Downside Threshold: With respect to each Underlying, a percentage of the Initial Underlying Level of that Underlying, as specified on the cover of this pricing supplement Initial Underlying Level: With respect to each Underlying, the Closing Level of that Underlying on the Trade Date, as specified on the cover of this pricing supplement Final Underlying Level: With respect to each Underlying, the Closing Level of that Underlying on the Final Valuation Date Closing Level: With respect to each Underlying, Closing Level has the meaning set forth under “Reference Assets—Indices—Special Calculation Provisions” in the prospectus supplement.

Investment Timeline

Trade Date: The Closing Level of each Underlying (the Initial Underlying Level) is observed and the Downside Threshold of each Underlying is determined. Monthly (callable by Issuer at its election beginning March 17, 2026):

The Issuer will pay you the applicable Monthly Coupon.

The Issuer may, at its election and upon written notice to the trustee, call the Notes on any monthly Optional Call Notice Date, beginning on March 17, 2026, regardless of the Closing Level of either Underlying on that Optional Call Notice Date. If the Issuer elects to call the Notes, the Issuer will pay the principal amount of your Notes plus the Monthly Coupon due on the Coupon Payment Date that is also the Call Settlement Date, and no further amounts will be owed to you under the Notes.

Maturity Date:

The Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is determined as of the Final Valuation Date.

If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold, the Issuer will pay you a cash payment on the Maturity Date equal to $10 per Note plus the final Monthly Coupon.

If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, on the Maturity Date, the Issuer will pay you the final Monthly Coupon, but will repay less than your principal amount, resulting in a percentage loss of principal equal to the negative Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying. You will receive a cash payment on the Maturity Date per Note, calculated as follows:

[$10 × (1 + Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying)] + final Monthly Coupon

Accordingly, you may lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity, depending on how much the Lesser Performing Underlying declines, regardless of the performance of the other Underlying.

Investing in the Notes involves significant risks. You may lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount. You will be exposed to the market risk of each Underlying and any decline in the level of one Underlying may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the level of the other Underlying. The Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is observed relative to its Downside Threshold only on the Final Valuation Date, and the contingent repayment of principal applies only if you hold the Notes to maturity. Generally, the higher the Coupon Rate on a Note, the greater the risk of loss on that Note. Your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Monthly Coupons paid on the Notes until maturity or earlier call, and you will not participate in any appreciation of either Underlying. Any payment on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party. If Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its payment obligations or become subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, you might not receive any amounts owed to you under the Notes.

Key Risks

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in either or both Underlyings or the securities composing the Underlyings. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

¨You may lose a significant portion or all of your principal — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily pay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes, at maturity, the Issuer will pay you the principal amount of your Notes only if the Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold and will make such payment only at maturity. If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, you will receive the final Monthly Coupon, but you will be exposed to the full decline in the Lesser Performing Underlying and the Issuer will repay less than the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity, if anything, resulting in a percentage loss of principal equal to the negative Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying. Accordingly, you may lose a significant portion or all of your principal.

¨Your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Monthly Coupons paid on the Notes until maturity or earlier call, and you will not participate in any appreciation of either Underlying — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified per annum Coupon Rate, regardless of any appreciation of either Underlying. If the Notes are called at the election of the Issuer, you will not receive Monthly Coupons or any other payment after the applicable Call Settlement Date. Because the Notes could be called as early as approximately three months after the Trade Date, the total return on the Notes could be minimal. If the Notes are not called, you may be subject to the decline in the level of the Lesser Performing Underlying even though you will not participate in any appreciation of either Underlying. As a result, the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in either or both Underlyings or the securities composing the Underlyings.

¨You are exposed to the market risk of each Underlying with respect to the payment at maturity, if any — Your return on the Notes (other than the Monthly Coupons) is not linked to a basket consisting of the Underlyings. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Underlying. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Underlying. Poor performance by either Underlying over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the level of the other Underlying. If the Notes have not been called prior to maturity and the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, you will be exposed to the full decline in the Lesser Performing Underlying. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Underlying.

¨Because the Notes are linked to the Lesser Performing Underlying, you are exposed to greater risk of sustaining a significant loss of principal at maturity than if the Notes were linked to a single Underlying — The risk that you will lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Underlying. With two Underlyings, it is more likely that the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying will be less than its Downside Threshold and, therefore, it is more likely that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. In addition, the performance of the Underlyings may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between two Underlyings, the greater the potential for one of those Underlyings to close below its Downside Threshold on the Final Valuation Date. See “Correlation of the Underlyings” below.

It is impossible to predict what the correlation between the Underlyings will be over the term of the Notes. The Underlyings represent different equity markets. The Russell 2000® Index represents the small-capitalization segment of the United States equity market and the EURO STOXX 50® Index represents equity markets in the Eurozone. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes.

Although the correlation of the Underlyings’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Coupon Rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Underlyings’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Coupon Rate is generally associated with lower correlation of the Underlyings, which reflects a greater potential for a loss of principal at maturity. The correlation referenced in setting the terms of the Notes is calculated using our internal models and is not derived from the returns of the Underlyings over the period set forth under “Correlation of the Underlyings” below. In addition, other factors and inputs other than correlation may impact how the terms of the Notes are set and the performance of the Notes.

¨If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes, the payment at maturity, if any, is calculated based solely on the performance of the Lesser Performing Underlying — If the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes pursuant to the Call Feature, the payment at maturity (other than the final Monthly Coupon), if any, will be linked solely to the performance of the Lesser Performing Underlying. As a result, in the event that the Final Underlying Level of the Lesser Performing Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold, the Underlying Return of only the Lesser Performing Underlying will be used to determine the payment at maturity (other than the final Monthly Coupon) on your Notes, and you will not benefit from the performance of the other Underlying, even if the Final Underlying Level of the other Underlying is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold or Initial Underlying Level.

¨Call and reinvestment risk — The Issuer may, in its sole discretion, call the Notes on any monthly Optional Call Notice Date, beginning on March 17, 2026, regardless of the Closing Level of either Underlying on that Optional Call Notice Date. If the Issuer elects to call the Notes early, the holding period over which you would receive the per annum Coupon Rate could be as short as approximately three months. In the event the Issuer calls the Notes, there is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds at a comparable return and/or with a comparable Coupon Rate for a similar level of risk.

It is more likely that the Issuer will call the Notes at its election prior to maturity to the extent that the Monthly Coupons payable on the Notes are greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments issued by the Issuer of comparable maturity, terms and

PS- 8

credit rating trading in the market. The greater likelihood of the Issuer calling the Notes in that environment increases the risk that you will not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the called Notes in an equivalent investment with a similar Coupon Rate. The Issuer is less likely to call the Notes prior to maturity when the Monthly Coupons on the Notes are less than the interest that would be payable on other comparable instruments issued by the Issuer. Therefore, the Notes are more likely to remain outstanding when the Monthly Coupons on the Notes are less than what would be payable on other comparable instruments.

¨Any payment on the Notes (other than Monthly Coupons) will be determined based on the Closing Levels of the Underlyings on the dates specified — Any payment on the Notes (other than Monthly Coupons) will be determined based on the Closing Levels of the Underlyings on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Underlyings determined at any other time.

¨Contingent repayment of principal applies only at maturity or upon any call at the election of the Issuer — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any call at the election of the Issuer. The market value of the Notes may fluctuate between the date you purchase them and the Final Valuation Date. If you are able to sell your Notes prior to maturity in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell them at a loss relative to your principal amount even if at that time the level of either or both Underlyings is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold.

¨A higher Coupon Rate and/or a lower Downside Threshold may reflect greater expected volatility of the Underlyings, which is generally associated with a greater risk of loss — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the levels of the Underlyings over a period of time. The greater the expected volatilities of the Underlyings at the time the terms of the Notes are set, the greater the expectation is at that time that you may lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity. In addition, the economic terms of the Notes, including the Coupon Rate and the Downside Threshold, are based, in part, on the expected volatilities of the Underlyings at the time the terms of the Notes are set, where higher expected volatilities will generally be reflected in a higher Coupon Rate than the fixed rate we would pay on conventional debt securities of the same maturity and/or on otherwise comparable securities and/or a lower Downside Threshold as compared to otherwise comparable securities. Accordingly, a higher Coupon Rate will generally be indicative of a greater risk of loss while a lower Downside Threshold does not necessarily indicate that the Notes have a greater likelihood of returning your principal at maturity. You should be willing to accept the downside market risk of each Underlying and the potential loss of a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity.

¨Owning the Notes is not the same as owning the securities composing either or both Underlyings — The return on your Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the securities composing either or both Underlyings. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the securities composing either Underlying would have.

¨No assurance that the investment view implicit in the Notes will be successful — It is impossible to predict whether and the extent to which the level of either Underlying will rise or fall. There can be no assurance that the level of either Underlying will not close below its Downside Threshold on the Final Valuation Date. The level of each Underlying will be influenced by complex and interrelated political, economic, financial and other factors that affect that Underlying. You should be willing to accept the downside risks associated with equities in general and each Underlying in particular, and the risk of losing a significant portion or all of your principal amount.

¨Tax treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “What Are the Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes?” on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

¨Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

¨You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlyings

¨Each Underlying reflects the price return of the securities composing that Underlying, not the total return — The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Underlyings, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing each

PS- 9

Underlying. Each Underlying is not a “total return” index that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing the applicable Underlying. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature.

¨Adjustments to the Underlyings could adversely affect the value of the Notes — The sponsor of an Underlying may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Underlying or make other methodological changes to that Underlying that could affect its performance. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Level of an Underlying in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Underlying. In addition, the sponsor of an Underlying may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Underlying at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the discontinued Underlying or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Level of that Underlying. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the relevant Underlying and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

¨The Notes are subject to small-capitalization companies risk with respect to the Russell 2000® Index — The Russell 2000® Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore securities linked to the Russell 2000® Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.

¨Non-U.S. securities markets risks with respect to the EURO STOXX 50® Index — The equity securities composing the EURO STOXX 50® Index are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

¨No direct exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the euro with respect to the EURO STOXX 50® Index — The EURO STOXX 50® Index is composed of non-U.S. securities denominated in euros. Because the level of the EURO STOXX 50® Index is also calculated in euros (and not in U.S. dollars), the performance of the EURO STOXX 50® Index will not be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the euro. In addition, any payments on the Notes determined based in part on the performance of the EURO STOXX 50® Index will not be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Therefore, holders of the Notes will not benefit from any appreciation of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar.

¨We may accelerate the Notes if a change-in-law event occurs — Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or an Underlying or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

¨Dealer incentives — We, the Agents and affiliates of the Agents act in various capacities with respect to the Notes. The Agents and various affiliates may act as a principal, agent or dealer in connection with the Notes. We will not pay compensation to the Agents in connection with the distribution of the Notes.

¨Potentially inconsistent research, opinions or recommendations by Barclays Capital Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc. or their respective affiliates — Barclays Capital Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc. or their respective affiliates and agents may publish research from time to time on financial markets and other matters that may influence the value of the Notes, or express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any research, opinions or recommendations expressed by Barclays Capital Inc., UBS Financial Services Inc. or their respective affiliates or agents may not be consistent with each other and may be modified from time to time without notice. You should make your own independent investigation of the merits of investing in the Notes and each Underlying.

¨Potential Barclays Bank PLC impact on the levels of the Underlyings — Trading or transactions by Barclays Bank PLC or its affiliates in the securities composing the Underlyings and/or over-the-counter options, futures or other instruments with returns linked to

PS- 10

the performance of either or both Underlyings or the securities composing the Underlyings, may adversely affect the level of either Underlying and, therefore, the market value of the Notes.

¨We and our affiliates may engage in various activities or make determinations that could materially affect your Notes in various ways and create conflicts of interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to an Underlying or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Underlyings and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlyings” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

¨There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.

¨Many economic and market factors will impact the value of the Notes — Structured notes, including the Notes, can be thought of as securities that combine a debt instrument with one or more options or other derivative instruments. As a result, the factors that influence the values of debt instruments and options or other derivative instruments will also influence the terms and features of the Notes at issuance and their value in the secondary market. Accordingly, in addition to the levels of the Underlyings on any day, the value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

¨the expected volatility of the Underlyings;

¨correlation (or lack of correlation) of the Underlyings;

¨the time to maturity of the Notes;

¨the market prices of, and dividend rates on, the securities composing the Underlyings;

¨interest and yield rates in the market generally;

¨supply and demand for the Notes;

¨a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory and judicial events;

¨the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro; and

¨our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

¨The estimated value of your Notes is lower than the initial issue price of your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Trade Date is lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

¨The estimated value of your Notes might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Trade Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in

PS- 11

the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Also, this difference in funding rate as well as certain factors, such as sales commissions, selling concessions, estimated costs and profits mentioned below, reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you.

¨The estimated value of the Notes is based on our internal pricing models, which may prove to be inaccurate and may be different from the pricing models of other financial institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Trade Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

¨The estimated value of your Notes is not a prediction of the prices at which you may sell your Notes in the secondary market, if any, and such secondary market prices, if any, will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes and may be lower than the estimated value of your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

¨The temporary price at which we may initially buy the Notes in the secondary market and the value we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Trade Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Trade Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

Hypothetical Examples

Hypothetical terms only. Actual terms may vary. See the cover page for actual offering terms.

The examples below illustrate the payment upon a call or at maturity for a $10 principal amount Note on a hypothetical offering of the Notes under various scenarios, with the assumptions set forth below.* You should not take these examples as an indication or assurance of the expected performance of the Notes. The examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes. Numbers appearing in the examples below have been rounded for ease of analysis. In these examples, we refer to the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index as the “RTY Index” and the “SX5E Index,” respectively.

Term: Approximately 1.25 years (unless called earlier at the election of the Issuer) Coupon Rate: 9.20% per annum (or 0.7667% per month) Monthly Coupon: $0.0767 per month Hypothetical Initial Underlying Level: 100.000 for the RTY Index and 100.00 for the SX5E Index Hypothetical Downside Threshold: 70.000 for the RTY Index and 70.00 for the SX5E Index (which, with respect to each Underlying, is 70.00% of the hypothetical Initial Underlying Level of that Underlying) Optional Call Notice Dates: Monthly, beginning on March 17, 2026, as set forth under “Final Terms” in this pricing supplement

*Terms used for purposes of these hypothetical examples do not represent the actual Initial Underlying Levels or Downside Thresholds. The hypothetical Initial Underlying Levels of 100.000 for the RTY Index and 100.00 for the SX5E Index have been chosen for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the actual Initial Underlying Levels for the Underlyings. The actual Initial Underlying Level and Downside Threshold of each Underlying are set forth on the cover of this pricing supplement. For historical Closing Levels of the Underlyings, please see the historical information set forth under the sections titled “Russell 2000® Index” and “EURO STOXX 50® Index” below. We cannot predict the Closing Level of either Underlying on any day during the term of the Notes, including on the Final Valuation Date.

The examples below are purely hypothetical. These examples are intended to illustrate (a) the effect of an Issuer-elected call, (b) how the value of the payment at maturity on the Notes will depend on whether the Final Underlying Level of either Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold and (c) how the total return on the Notes may be less than the total return on a direct investment in either or both Underlyings in certain scenarios. The “total return” as used in this pricing supplement is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the total payments per Note over the term of the Notes to the $10 principal amount.

Example 1 — Issuer Elects to Call the Notes on the First Optional Call Notice Date

Payment on Call Settlement Date: $10.0767 ($10.00 + $0.0767) Prior Monthly Coupons: $0.1534 ($0.0767 × 2) Total: $10.2301 Total Return: 2.301%

On the first Optional Call Notice Date (which occurs approximately three months after the Trade Date), the Issuer elects to call the Notes. The Issuer will pay you on the Call Settlement Date $10.0767 per Note, which is equal to your principal amount plus the Monthly Coupon due on the Coupon Payment Date that is also the Call Settlement Date. No further amounts will be owed to you under the Notes.

In addition, the Issuer has previously paid the Monthly Coupon of $0.0767 on each of the first two Coupon Payment Dates. Accordingly, the Issuer will have paid a total of $10.2301 per Note for a total return of 2.301% on the Notes.

PS- 13

Example 2 — Notes Are NOT Called and the Final Underlying Level of Each Underlying Is At or Above Its Downside Threshold

Payment at Maturity: $10.0767 ($10.00 + $0.0767) Prior Monthly Coupons: $1.0738 ($0.0767 × 14) Total: $11.1505 Total Return: 11.505%

In this example, the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Notes remain outstanding until maturity. Because the Final Underlying Level of each Underlying is greater than or equal to its Downside Threshold, the Issuer will pay you on the Maturity Date $10.0767 per Note, which is equal to your principal amount plus the final Monthly Coupon.

In addition, the Issuer has previously paid the Monthly Coupon of $0.0767 on each of the fourteen Coupon Payment Dates that occur prior to the Final Valuation Date. Accordingly, the Issuer will have paid a total of $11.1505 per Note for a total return of 11.505% on the Notes.

PS- 14

Example 3 — Notes Are NOT Called and the Final Underlying Level of At Least One Underlying Is Below Its Downside Threshold

Payment at Maturity: $4.5767 ($4.50 + $0.0767) Prior Monthly Coupons: $1.0738 ($0.0767 × 14) Total: $5.6505 Total Return: -43.495%

In this example, the Issuer does not elect to call the Notes and the Notes remain outstanding until maturity. Because the Final Underlying Level of at least one Underlying is less than its Downside Threshold on the Final Valuation Date, at maturity, the Issuer will pay the final Monthly Coupon, but will repay less than the principal amount, resulting in a loss of principal proportionate to the decline of the Lesser Performing Underlying. The payment at maturity will be calculated as follows:

[$10 × (1 + Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying)] + final Monthly Coupon

Step 1: Calculate the Underlying Return of each Underlying:

Underlying Return of the RTY Index:

Final Underlying Level – Initial Underlying Level = 45.000 – 100.000 = -55.00% Initial Underlying Level 100.000

Underlying Return of the SX5E Index:

Final Underlying Level – Initial Underlying Level = 110.00 – 100.00 = 10.00% Initial Underlying Level 100.00

Step 2: Determine the Lesser Performing Underlying. The RTY Index is the Underlying with the lower Underlying Return.

Step 3: Calculate the Payment at Maturity:

[$10 × (1 + Underlying Return of the Lesser Performing Underlying)] + final Monthly Coupon

= [$10 × (1 + -55.00%)] + $0.0767

= $4.50 + $0.0767

= $4.5767

In addition, the Issuer has previously paid the Monthly Coupon of $0.0767 on each of the fourteen Coupon Payment Dates that occur prior to the Final Valuation Date. Accordingly, the Issuer will have paid a total of $5.6505 per Note for a total return of -43.495% on the Notes.

What Are the Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes?

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Put Options and Deposits” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Notes.

Due to the lack of direct legal authority, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes. Our special tax counsel believes that it is reasonable to treat a Note for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a put option (the “Put Option”) written by you to us with respect to the Lesser Performing Underlying, secured by a cash deposit equal to the initial issue price of the Notes (the “Deposit”), which will have an annual yield based on our cost of borrowing, as shown below. If this treatment is respected, only a portion of each Monthly Coupon will be attributable to interest on the Deposit; the remainder will represent premium attributable to your grant of the Put Option (“Put Premium”). By purchasing the Notes, you agree to treat the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes consistently with the treatment and allocation as described above. We will follow this approach in determining our information reporting responsibilities, if any.

Assuming the treatment and allocation described above are respected, interest on the Deposit will be taxed as ordinary income, while the Put Premium will not be taken into account prior to the taxable disposition of the Notes (including upon early redemption or at maturity). Assuming that you are an initial purchaser of Notes purchasing the Notes at the initial issue price for cash, (i) if your Notes are called or held to maturity and the Put Option expires unexercised (i.e., you receive a cash payment—not including the final Monthly Coupon—at maturity equal to the amount of the Deposit), you will recognize short-term capital gain in an amount equal to the total Put Premium received, and (ii) if, instead, the Put Option is deemed to be exercised at maturity (i.e., you receive a cash payment at maturity—not including the final Monthly Coupon—that is less than the amount of the Deposit), you will recognize short-term capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (x) the total Put Premium received and (y) the cash settlement value of the Put Option (i.e., the amount of the Deposit minus the cash you receive at maturity, not including the final Monthly Coupon).

There are, however, other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt for the Notes, in which case the timing and character of your income or loss could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses on a number of issues, the most relevant of which for investors in the Notes are the character of income or loss (including whether the Put Premium might be currently included as ordinary income) and the degree, if any, to which income realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax. While it is not clear whether the Notes would be viewed as similar to the typical prepaid forward contract described in the notice, it is possible that any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice. Purchasers who are not initial purchasers of Notes at the initial issue price should also consult their tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments, as well as the allocation of the purchase price of the Notes between the Deposit and the Put Option.

The discussions above and in the accompanying prospectus supplement do not address the consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b).

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, our special tax counsel is of the opinion that these regulations should not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.

Consistent with the position described above, below are the portions of each Monthly Coupon that we intend, in determining our reporting responsibilities (if any), to treat as attributable to interest on the Deposit and to Put Premium:

Coupon Rate

per Annum Interest on Deposit

per Annum Put Premium

per Annum 9.20% 4.05% 5.15%

Russell 2000® Index

The Russell 2000® Index (the “RTY Index”) measures the capitalization-weighted price performance of 2,000 U.S. small-capitalization stocks listed on eligible U.S. exchanges and is designed to track the performance of the small-capitalization segment of the U.S. equity market. For more information about the RTY Index, see “Indices—The Russell Indices” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

Historical Information

The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the RTY Index from January 2, 2015 through December 17, 2025, based on the daily Closing Levels of the RTY Index. The Closing Level of the RTY Index on December 17, 2025 was 2,492.295. The dotted line represents the Downside Threshold of 1,744.607, which is equal to 70.00% of the Initial Underlying Level of the RTY Index.

We obtained the Closing Levels of the RTY Index from Bloomberg Professional® service (“Bloomberg”), without independent verification. Historical performance of the RTY Index should not be taken as an indication of future performance. Future performance of the RTY Index may differ significantly from historical performance, and no assurance can be given as to the Closing Level of the RTY Index during the term of the Notes, including on the Final Valuation Date. We cannot give you assurance that the performance of the RTY Index will not result in a loss of your principal amount.

Historical Information

The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the SX5E Index from January 2, 2015 through December 17, 2025, based on the daily Closing Levels of the SX5E Index. The Closing Level of the SX5E Index on December 17, 2025 was 5,681.67. The dotted line represents the Downside Threshold of 3,977.17, which is equal to 70.00% of the Initial Underlying Level of the SX5E Index.

We obtained the Closing Levels of the SX5E Index from Bloomberg, without independent verification. Historical performance of the SX5E Index should not be taken as an indication of future performance. Future performance of the SX5E Index may differ significantly from historical performance, and no assurance can be given as to the Closing Level of the SX5E Index during the term of the Notes, including on the Final Valuation Date.

Correlation of the Underlyings

The following graph sets forth the historical performances of the Russell 2000® Index and the EURO STOXX 50® Index from January 2, 2015 through December 17, 2025, based on the daily Closing Levels of the Underlyings. For comparison purposes, each Underlying has been normalized to have a Closing Level of 100.00 on January 2, 2015 by dividing the Closing Level of that Underlying on each day by the Closing Level of that Underlying on January 2, 2015 and multiplying by 100.00.

We obtained the Closing Levels used to determine the normalized Closing Levels set forth below from Bloomberg, without independent verification. Historical performance of the Underlyings should not be taken as an indication of future performance. Future performance of the Underlyings may differ significantly from historical performance, and no assurance can be given as to the Closing Levels of the Underlyings during the term of the Notes, including on the Final Valuation Date. We cannot give you assurance that the performances of the Underlyings will not result in a loss of your principal amount.

PAST PERFORMANCE AND CORRELATION OF THE UNDERLYINGS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR CORRELATION.

The correlation of a pair of Underlyings represents a statistical measurement of the degree to which the returns of those Underlyings were similar to each other over a given period in terms of timing and direction. The correlation between a pair of Underlyings is scaled from 1.0 to -1.0, with 1.0 indicating perfect positive correlation (i.e., the value of both Underlyings are increasing together or decreasing together and the ratio of their returns has been constant), 0 indicating no correlation (i.e., there is no statistical relationship between the returns of that pair of Underlyings) and -1.0 indicating perfect negative correlation (i.e., as the value of one Underlying increases, the value of the other Underlying decreases and the ratio of their returns has been constant).

The closer the relationship of the returns of a pair of Underlyings over a given period, the more positively correlated those Underlyings are. The graph above illustrates the historical performance of each Underlying relative to each other over the time period shown and provides an indication of how close the relative performance of each Underlying has historically been to the other Underlying. However, the graph does not provide a precise measurement of the correlation of the Underlyings. Moreover, any historical correlation of the Underlyings is not indicative of the degree of correlation of the Underlyings, if any, that will be experienced over the term of the Notes.

The lower (or more negative) the correlation between the Underlyings, the less likely it is that the Underlyings will move in the same direction at the same time and, therefore, the greater the potential for one of the Underlyings to close below its Downside Threshold on the Final Valuation Date. This is because the less positively correlated the Underlyings are, the greater the likelihood that at least one of the Underlyings will decrease in value. However, even if the Underlyings have a higher positive correlation, one or both of the Underlyings might close below its Downside Threshold on the Final Valuation Date, as both of the Underlyings may decrease in value together.

Although the correlation of the Underlyings’ performance may change over the term of the Notes, the Coupon Rate is determined, in part, based on the correlation of the Underlyings’ performance calculated using our internal models at the time when the terms of the Notes are finalized. A higher Coupon Rate is generally associated with lower correlation of the Underlyings, which reflects a greater potential for a loss of principal at maturity. The correlation referenced in setting the terms of the Notes is calculated using our internal models and is not derived from the returns of the Underlyings over the period set forth above. In addition, other factors and inputs other than correlation may impact how the terms of the Notes are set and the performance of the Notes.

INDIANAPOLIS — Eli Lilly and Co. announced Thursday, Dec. 18 that its experimental daily GLP-1 pill, orforglipron, successfully helped patients maintain significant weight loss after they stopped using popular injectable treatments like Wegovy and Zepbound.

The Phase 3 ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial is the first of its kind to demonstrate that a “small molecule” oral drug can prevent the weight regain that often occurs when patients cease injectable incretin therapies. Lilly confirmed it has submitted the drug to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval.

In the 52-week study, participants who switched from Wegovy to orforglipron maintained almost all of their progress, seeing an average weight change of less than one kilogram. Those who switched to the pill from Zepbound saw a modest average increase of 5 kilograms but fared significantly better than those on a placebo, who experienced rapid weight regain.

“Obesity is a chronic, progressive disease, and sustaining weight loss remains a significant challenge,” said Kenneth Custer, Lilly’s executive vice president of cardiometabolic health in a press release. He noted that the pill offers a “convenient alternative” for long-term weight management without the need for weekly needles.

Orforglipron works as a GLP-1 receptor agonist, similar to the active ingredients in current injectables, but its chemical structure allows it to be absorbed effectively through the digestive tract. Current blockbuster treatments are peptides, meaning short chains of amino acids. Because they are large, fragile molecules, the human stomach would digest them like the protein in steak or eggs before they could enter the bloodstream. This is why they must be injected into the fatty tissue to bypass the digestive system.

Orforglipron is a small molecule drug. Unlike peptides, these are chemically synthesized to be much smaller and more stable. They are designed to survive the harsh, acidic environment of the stomach and pass through the intestinal wall into the blood.

The study reported that side effects were primarily gastrointestinal, such as nausea and constipation, and were generally mild to moderate. No new safety concerns or liver issues were identified.

If approved, orforglipron would represent a major shift in the obesity market, providing a shelf-stable, easy-to-take option for millions of individuals transitioning out of the intensive weight-loss phase of their treatment.",https://www.inkfreenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eli-Lilly-Adverum-Biotech-researcher-scientist-lab-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-20 08:58:00.323110

WASHINGTON – Friends of the Earth released its 2025 Bee-Friendly Retailer Scorecard, the leading national assessment of how the largest U.S. grocery retailers are addressing toxic pesticides in their supply chains. Several companies have recently strengthened their pollinator health policies, but widespread inaction continues to expose the industry to mounting financial, ecological, and consumer trust risks.

The Scorecard evaluates 25 of the country’s top grocery retailers on their commitments and progress toward reducing pesticides linked to the decline of bees, biodiversity, soil health, and human health. This year, Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc (NASDAQ: SFM) became only the second company to score in the “A” range, joining Whole Foods. Sprouts revealed a new commitment to pollinator health this December. The policy aims to reduce use of toxic pesticides in the company’s supply chain and build on the its industry-leading organic sales.

Organic sales are a key differentiator for retailers on the scorecard: the USDA Organic seal remains the most trusted benchmark for reduced pesticide use, prohibiting more than 900 synthetic pesticides — including many linked to risks for pollinators, soil health, and human well-being.

Costco (NASDAQ: COST) also advanced notably, rising from a “C” to a “B+” due to strong organic sales and reported progress toward implementing itspollinator health policy. Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) improved from an “F” to a “D-” based on Amazon Fresh sales of organic and other meaningful thirdparty certifications.

Laggards fall behind despite rising consumer concern about pesticides

While progress from top performers signals a shifting landscape, many retailers remain far behind. Six companies—Albertsons (NYSE: ACI), Aldi, CVS (NYSE: CVS), Kroger (NYSE: KR), Southeastern Grocers, and Target (NYSE: TGT)—lost points for failing to communicate meaningful progress toward meeting their pollinator health commitments.

Target fell from a “D-” to an “F,” joining Wegmans, BJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE: BJ), H-E-B, Walgreens (NASDAQ: WBA), Hy-Vee, Dollar General (NYSE: DG), Publix, and Wakefern.

The Scorecard’s findings come amid intensifying public concern about pesticide exposure. National polling consistently shows that consumers — especially parents — are increasingly seeking organic and pesticide-free options and expect retailers to be transparent about chemical use in their supply chains.

Recent investigative testing underscores these concerns: a Friends of the Earth-commissioned study detected multipletoxic pesticides in Target’sGood & Gather baby food, including neurotoxins, hormone disruptors, and PFAS “forever chemicals.”

Pesticides pose growing financial and supply-chain risks for retailers

A recent analysis commissioned by Friends of the Earth estimates that the U.S. food retail sector faces $219 billion in climate, financial, and biodiversity risks stemming from pesticide-dependent agriculture on just four major crops.

Retailers are also likely to face supply constraints and price volatility as pollinator populations decline. Research has already linked pollinator loss to reduced yields in key crops such as apples and cherries — products central to grocery produce departments.

“Pesticides are a linchpin in an industrial food system that is destroying the web of life — from pollinators to soil to human health,” said Kendra Klein, deputy director of science at Friends of the Earth. “Retailers have both the power and responsibility to accelerate a transition to safer, more resilient agriculture. The leaders on this Scorecard prove that progress is possible — and consumers are demanding it.”

Pesticide impacts extend beyond pollinators

All major classes of commonly used pesticides threatenthe soil organisms essential for carbon sequestration, water conservation, and climate resilience. These chemicals also harm human health—from the farmworkers who face daily exposure to consumers who encounter dozens of pesticide residues in their diets. A growing body of research shows even low-level exposures can pose serious risks to infants and children, yet federal standards fail to adequately protect vulnerable populations.

Retailers hold the key to systemwide change

The sector’s largest players — including Walmart, Kroger, Costco, Amazon, Albertsons, and Target — control an estimated $754 billion in annual grocery sales, giving them immense leverage to drive pesticide reduction across U.S. agriculture.

The Bee-Friendly Retailer campaign is supported by more than 100 beekeeping, farming, farmworker, consumer, and environmental organizations, including the Campaign for Healthier Solutions, which works with dollar stores to eliminate hazardous chemicals from store shelves.

Know Your Rights: According to Canada’s Passenger Bill of Rights, you may be entitled to compensation for significant delays and cancellations, especially when caused by reasons within the airline’s control.

Contact the Airline for Rebooking: If your flight is delayed or cancelled, contact the airline directly to rebook or arrange for accommodations if necessary.

Sign Up for Notifications: Most airlines offer text message or email alerts for flight status changes. Make sure you’re signed up so you can react quickly to any further disruptions.

Consider Alternative Routes: If your flight is cancelled or heavily delayed, ask the airline about potential alternative routes or connections. Consider flying from other nearby airports if possible.

Prepare for Extended Wait Times: With the continued weather disruptions, long wait times at airport terminals may occur. Pack essentials like snacks, medications, and entertainment to make your wait more comfortable.

As winter storms continue to impact major airports across Canada, travelers are urged to plan accordingly and monitor updates from their airlines. With ongoing snow, wind, and cold temperatures, disruptions are likely to persist in the coming days. Be sure to stay informed, check for cancellations, and take the necessary steps to ensure your travel plans proceed smoothly.

NEW YORK/TOKYO/SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 19 (Reuters) – SoftBank Group is racing to close a $22.5 billion funding commitment to OpenAI by year-end through an array of cash-raising schemes, including a sale of some investments, and could tap its undrawn margin loans borrowed against its valuable ownership in chip firm Arm Holdings, sources said.

The “all-in” bet on OpenAI is among the biggest yet by SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, as the Japanese billionaire seeks ‍to improve his firm’s position in the race for artificial intelligence. To come up with the money, Son has already sold SoftBank’s entire $5.8 billion stake in AI chip leader Nvidia, offloaded $4.8 billion of its T-Mobile US stake, and slashed staff.

Son has slowed most other dealmaking at SoftBank’s Vision Fund to a crawl, and any deal above $50 million now requires his explicit approval, two of the sources told Reuters.

Son’s firm is working to take public its payments app operator, PayPay. The initial public offering, originally expected this month, was pushed back due to the 43-day-long U.S. government shutdown, which ended in November. PayPay’s market debut, likely to raise more than $20 billion, is now expected in the first quarter of next year, according to one direct source and another person familiar with the efforts.

The Japanese ‌conglomerate is also looking to cash out some of its holdings in Didi Global, the operator of China’s dominant ride-hailing platform, ‌which is looking to list its shares in Hong Kong after a regulatory crackdown forced it to delist in the U.S. in 2021, a source with direct knowledge said. Investment managers at SoftBank’s Vision Fund are being directed toward the OpenAI deal, two of the above sources said.

SoftBank’s scramble to marshal funds offers a window into the strain faced even by the world’s biggest dealmakers as they scramble to finance ambitious AI data center projects worth hundreds of billions of dollars.

SoftBank declined to comment.

SOFTBANK HAS OPTIONS

OpenAI has not yet received the remaining funding, ​but expects the money to come in by the end of 2025, as stipulated in the contract, sources said.

SoftBank has multiple sources of capital it could tap, including margin loans, cash on its balance sheet, stakes in listed companies, and corporate bonds or bridge loans, sources said.

Son has strong reasons to draw on a range of funding mechanisms to fulfill ‍those obligations. SoftBank secured a deal to invest in OpenAI at a $300 billion valuation in April. Since ​then, the valuation of OpenAI has risen dramatically and the company is in talks to raise additional funding from investors, including Amazon, tripling ​its valuation to close to $900 billion, one of the sources added, which would give SoftBank a significant paper gain once the transaction is completed.

A major pool of capital for SoftBank ‍is its undrawn capacity of margin loans borrowed against its ownership of British semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings. SoftBank recently expanded its margin loan capacity by $6.5 billion, bringing the total undrawn capacity to $11.5 billion. Arm’s stock has since tripled from its IPO price, providing SoftBank with additional collateral headroom to expand its borrowing capacity.

SoftBank reported parent-level cash of 4.2 trillion yen ($27.16 billion) as of September 30. The group still owns about 4% of T-Mobile US, remaining the wireless carrier’s second-largest shareholder, a stake worth roughly $11 billion at the end of September, according to LSEG data.

Despite investing at a less active pace, it has continued to back AI startups such as Sierra and Skild AI.

OPENAI NEEDS THE ‍MONEY

Both OpenAI and SoftBank are investors in Stargate, a $500 billion initiative to build AI data centers for training and inference that executives say is crucial to the U.S. government’s ambitions to keep ahead of China in AI.

The rush to build data centers has also prompted tech giants including Meta Platforms to commit unprecedented sums to these buildouts – which need chips, ‍power, cooling, and servers – and they have brought in deep-pocketed ‍partners to spread the risk. Their hefty capital outlays have sparked concerns about what happens if the investments fail to bring commensurate ​returns, raising the specter of an “AI bubble” bursting.

SoftBank promised in April to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI – $10 billion of which ​the startup would receive ⁠the same month. The rest of the payment was contingent on the AI startup transitioning to a for-profit corporation by ‌the end of the year, an ambitious feat that OpenAI achieved in October.

The new funding is crucial for covering OpenAI’s rising costs to train and run its AI models as competition from Alphabet’s Google ratchets up. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told employees recently that the company is now entering a “code red” phase to improve ChatGPT — delaying other product rollouts to fend off the momentum behind Google’s Gemini.

In October, Altman said OpenAI aimed to build 30 gigawatts of computing capacity for $1.4 trillion. He said he ultimately wants OpenAI to add 1 gigawatt of compute every week – an enormous target given that each gigawatt currently comes with a capital cost of more than $40 billion.

What's inspiring creatives in 2025

Apple continues to shape how creative professionals think and build. In Adobe’s survey, 29% of respondents named Apple the most creatively inspiring brand, far ahead of Adidas (17%) and Google (16%). The brand’s blend of visual minimalism, product consistency, and emotional resonance keeps it front and center across industries.

On the public figure side, Beyoncé and Rihanna tied at 19% each, followed by Taylor Swift (17%), Billie Eilish (15%), and Bad Bunny (14%). Each has built a visual and cultural brand that extends far beyond music.

Minimalism and nostalgia are tied at the top when it comes to aesthetic inspiration, each scoring 25%. Creators are clearly split between forward-looking simplicity and throwback familiarity.

The platforms and formats driving content ideas

TikTok is now the go-to platform for creative inspiration. Nearly one in three creatives (29%) said they turn to the app first, followed by Instagram (25%) and YouTube (20%). The constant stream of trend-driven content on these platforms helps creators stay plugged into what’s resonating in real time.

Short-form video dominates as the most inspiring content type. Over half of the creatives surveyed (56%) cited it as their top source of inspiration, outpacing memes and pop culture (35%) and long-form video (33%).

What’s notable is how many creatives actively reverse-engineer content. Half said they analyze social posts to understand what works. Another 42% look at branding and visual elements, while 35% study videos. Dissecting what resonates has become a core part of the ideation process.

Why brand identity is getting a refresh

Looking ahead to 2026, 48% of creatives said they plan to update their brand identity. Eleven percent are going further and planning a full rebrand. This reflects a broader need to adapt to shifting audience expectations and rising visual standards.

But staying relevant isn’t easy. Over half of respondents (56%) said they feel pressured to follow design trends. Thirty percent said they feel overwhelmed by the volume of new trends surfacing across platforms.

Despite that, creatives are aiming for balance. While 39% prioritize originality, 50% said the key is blending original thinking with trend awareness. Only 11% said following trends should take priority.

What marketers should know

Here’s what brand strategists and creative leads should take away from Adobe’s findings:

1. Treat TikTok as a trend engine, not just a channel

If your team isn’t using TikTok to monitor visual trends and content formats, you’re missing a major source of inspiration. It’s where ideas start, not just where they’re shared.

2. Build systems for fast creative iteration

With short-form content and visual remixing taking over, speed matters. Use tools like mood board makers and video templates to test and scale ideas quickly.

3. Anticipate a rebranding wave in 2026

If nearly half of creatives are preparing to update their brand identity, your competitors might be among them. Now is the time to evaluate your own branding and decide whether it’s built for the next wave of visual trends.

4. Don’t choose between minimalism and nostalgia

Both styles are peaking. Minimalism offers clarity in noisy feeds, while retro design taps into emotional storytelling. Experiment with both to see what resonates with your audience.

5. Support originality with structure

Original content doesn't mean starting from scratch. Encourage your team to study top-performing content, then layer in unique brand elements. Reverse-engineering is part of the process now.

Today’s creators are working in a space that’s moving faster than ever, but they’re not chasing trends blindly. They’re blending what works with their own creative DNA, whether that means leaning into Apple-level design polish or borrowing TikTok’s fast-cut energy.

For marketers, the message is clear. Watch what’s inspiring creators, and build flexible systems that help your brand move at the speed of culture.",https://www.contentgrip.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/12/What-inspires-today---s-creators-Apple--TikTok--and-minimalist-design-trends.webp,N,,2025-12-19 22:58:24.688398

(KDP, Financial) has announced a major financial move by entering into a Term Loan Agreement on December 18, 2025. The agreement, involving lenders and Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc. as the administrative agent, provides KDP with a 364-day term loan facility amounting to €10.35 billion. This strategic financial arrangement is set to support the company's planned acquisition of JDE Peet's.

The loan will bear interest at a rate tied to the EURIBO rate, with an additional margin ranging from 0.750% to 1.750%, contingent on the rating of certain index debt of KDP. Additionally, undrawn commitments will incur a commitment fee starting December 23, 2025, ranging from 0.060% to 0.200%, also dependent on the debt rating.

Obligations under this agreement are backed by KDP's subsidiaries that guarantee its revolving credit facility and outstanding senior notes. The agreement includes provisions for mandatory reductions or prepayments of the term loans with net cash proceeds from non-ordinary course asset sales, debt issuances, and equity issuances, subject to specific qualifications and exceptions.

The Term Loan Agreement encompasses customary representations and warranties for investment-grade Dutch certain funds financings. It also includes affirmative covenants imposing reporting and operational obligations on KDP and its subsidiaries, alongside negative covenants that restrict certain actions, such as incurring liens and executing fundamental changes. Financial covenants include a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00 and a maximum total net leverage ratio of 6.25 to 1.00, applicable under specific conditions.

In conjunction with this, KDP has amended its Bridge Credit Agreement, reducing the lenders' commitment by €10.35 billion, from €16.2 billion to €5.85 billion. This amendment ensures that certain debt proceeds will first reduce amounts under the Term Loan Agreement before affecting the Bridge Credit Agreement.

This strategic financial maneuver positions Keurig Dr Pepper to effectively fund its acquisition of JDE Peet's, potentially using proceeds from other debt or financings as alternatives to the Term Loan Agreement.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C000013NW.png?5,N,,2025-12-20 14:00:43.031996

With revenues of €6,2 billion in 2024, Dassault manages considerable volumes of data, a significant portion of which directly or indirectly relates to defense.","Data security is no longer a secondary issue for the defense industry. It has become a strategic lever in its own right. By announcing on December 16, 2025, its choice to rely on the Bleu trusted cloud to host its collaborative solutions, Dassault Aviation is taking a further step in the digital protection of its military programs. Behind a seemingly conventional technological decision lies a profound evolution in operational requirements, where infrastructure sovereignty directly conditions industrial security. The collaborative environments used by Dassault concentrate some of the group's most sensitive information. They include design data, exchanges between engineers, contractual documents, and elements related to the monitoring of civil and military aeronautical programs, sometimes spanning several decades. In this context, the choice of cloud infrastructure is no longer simply a matter of IT convenience. It commits the company to controlling access to its data and protecting itself against any external legal constraints. Dassault Aviation explains that using Bleu allows it to benefit from the advanced technologies of Microsoft Azure and Office 365 while ensuring that the environment remains exclusively governed by European law. This clarification directly addresses concerns related to extraterritorial legislation, which could impose access to data hosted by non-European entities. For a group at the heart of strategic programs, this exposure now constitutes an unacceptable risk.

Blue, a technological compromise under French control

Bleu is a company owned by Capgemini and Orange, operating a cloud infrastructure in France and governed by French law. For Dassault, this architecture allows for the combination of modern digital tools with strict access control, enhanced traceability, and governance compatible with the constraints of military programs. The group is not abandoning next-generation collaborative solutions, but is integrating them into a controlled framework designed for long-term sustainability. This operational continuity is a key point. Defense aeronautical programs require the stability of digital tools over extended periods, well beyond traditional technology cycles. The cloud must therefore be both scalable and sufficiently secure to support these projects without disruption or excessive dependence on external providers. The choice of Bleu is also based on the SecNumCloud 3.2 qualification, which the operator is currently pursuing. This label, awarded by the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), represents the highest French standard for hosting sensitive data. It imposes strict requirements regarding sovereignty, physical security, cybersecurity, and governance, in line with the expectations of the Ministry of the Armed Forces and state authorities. Dassault Aviation also indicates that it is considering ""restricted distribution"" certification for certain functionalities hosted on Bleu. This graduated approach allows the digital architecture to be adapted to the different levels of sensitivity of the information processed, without systematically switching to completely isolated environments. It reflects a pragmatic evolution of the digital defense doctrine, which accepts the cloud subject to rigorous and certified compartmentalization.

Digital sovereignty and industrial resilience

Beyond the technical aspects, Dassault Aviation's decision is part of a broader strategy of strategic autonomy. By securing its collaborative solutions on a trusted French cloud, the group reduces its dependence on foreign infrastructure while maintaining access to cutting-edge technologies. In a context of proliferating state-sponsored and hybrid cyber threats, the protection of industrial data is becoming an indirect factor in operational superiority. With revenues of €6,2 billion in 2024, Dassault manages considerable volumes of data, a significant portion of which directly or indirectly relates to defense. Securing this data is essential for the design of weapons systems, industrial coordination, and the ability to meet the requirements of the armed forces. By partnering with Bleu, the company is also contributing to the development of a credible sovereign cloud ecosystem, aligned with French priorities in cybersecurity, digital sovereignty, and defense.",https://entrevue.fr/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Logo_E.png,N,,2025-12-20 13:00:09.216064

Earlier this year, CoreWeave became an NVIDIA Exemplar Cloud for NVIDIA H100 GPU using up to 1,024 GPUs and a 30 billion parameter Llama 2-style model.

Why participating in the Exemplar Cloud Initiative matters

By examining benchmark data, developers, researchers, and engineers are empowered to optimize their deployments with confidence and hold providers accountable for delivering on performance. This transparent approach to performance measurement is essential for running mission-critical AI workloads.

The most recent results demonstrate how CoreWeave’s multi-generation approach to fine-tuned GPU performance with full stack observability and relentless automated performance optimizations yields consistent peak performance and reliability. This means having the ability to deploy demanding AI applications, such as large-scale pretraining or disaggregated multi-node inference with the confidence that the AI workloads will run efficiently and as expected. This minimizes guesswork and surprises with each generation of GPUs, providing the predictability and reproducibility AI pioneers need as they evolve models and scale training.

Quantifiable performance: key benchmark results

GPU performance was measured using Model Flops Utilization (MFU), the independent gold standard for measuring efficiency in large model training. CoreWeave’s clusters demonstrated superior utilization compared to reference targets, validating the strength of our architecture and integrated software stack. Key results include:

DeepSeek v3 (BF16): Achieved a 1.9% greater MFU than the NVIDIA reference target on 512 GPUs, confirming CoreWeave’s optimizations for unmatched performance.

Llama 3 70B (FP8): Posted a 2.4% greater MFU on 512 GPUs, proving enhanced efficiency even on widely adopted open-source models.

Unlocking predictability for AI pioneers

This milestone affirms the performance customers consistently receive from CoreWeave’s platform across generations of software and hardware. Predictable, highly efficient performance is essential for today’s long running training workloads, and this commitment to excellence is how CoreWeave helps customers achieve results faster and accelerate development timelines.

The certification process rigorously tests performance and stability under extreme load, focusing on:

Cluster goodput and efficiency for optimal training: Maximizing the amount of useful work achieved by the GPU cluster, ensuring resources are not wasted on idle time or I/O bottleneck.

Performance scaling for faster training completion: Demonstrating predictable and efficient scaling across large, distributed GB200 NVL72 clusters.

Hardware and system resilience for uninterrupted training: Validating the underlying infrastructure's ability to maintain stability during intense, prolonged training sessions.

Deep dive into CoreWeave’s groundbreaking results

To achieve these groundbreaking results, we didn't rely on a ""cherry-picked"" performance lab environment. Instead, the Exemplar Cloud benchmarks were conducted on a standard CoreWeave cloud cluster. The environment consisted of 8 racks of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 systems, seamlessly integrated via high speed NVIDIA Quantum-2 InfiniBand networking platform.

CoreWeave Mission Control was the key to operating the cluster with the utmost efficiency. It uses a massive dataset gathered from operating hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs to enable predictive failure detection and mitigation instead of passive monitoring. The system constantly tests and identifies suboptimal components, replacing them proactively before they can impact a customer's workload. This ensures that only the highest-performing, most reliable hardware is ever part of a cluster.

Our architecture is built to maximize performance, resiliency, and efficiency with deep integration between hardware and software. The runtime environment leverages a unified stack with performance optimizations across every layer from metal to model:

CoreWeave Bare Metal servers are fast, reliable, and performant, providing direct access to GPU computing resources without hypervisors that slow down processing, add overhead and latency. In addition, our network fabric enables high bandwidth memory and rapid data access for low latency, high throughput interconnects for the cluster.

CoreWeave Kubernetes Service (CKS) provides the base runtime environment and is fully integrated with CoreWeaveMission Control to minimize overhead and maximize compute performance.

CoreWeave Slurm on Kubernetes (SUNK) enables topology aware scheduling which optimizes performance and utilization for large scale training clusters. Based on a battle-tested Slurm distribution scaled to handle tens of thousands of nodes and hundreds of thousands of concurrent jobs, SUNK is also fully integrated with CoreWeaveMission Control. This allows maintenance and predictive fault management to happen without interrupting active jobs.

During the training run, CoreWeave Cabinet Visualizer was used to monitor the health of our full rack systems. The dashboard displayed statistics and historical data of each cabinet, including its cooling system, node pools, and NVIDIA NVLink bandwidth usage.

CoreWeave Cabinet Visualizer dashboard displays health status and performance metrics for each NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 Rack. CoreWeave Mission Control constantly monitors signals, and determines an individual component as production quality in real time.

During the training run, jobs were tracked using CoreWeave Mission Control observability for infrastructure level monitoring, and Weights & Biases for job level monitoring.

During the displayed iteration of the Exemplar Cloud benchmark job, an underperforming component was intentionally added to the cluster to demonstrate always-on GPU straggler detection.

To ensure performance remained uniform across all 8 racks, we utilized a recently launched CoreWeave Mission Control feature, CoreWeave GPU Straggler Detection. This tool provides real-time collective metrics, including Bus Bandwidth, ensuring all GPUs and communication paths perform equally. GPU Straggler Detection also automatically detects any hardware lockups and pinpoints the root cause.

The continuous performance monitoring provided by CoreWeave Mission Control enabled the benchmark to complete successfully with no actions taken by the cluster administrators to isolate faults or underperforming components. When the system detected any potential hardware faults, CoreWeave Mission Control automatically isolated the issue, surfaced the data in the SUNK and Weights & Biases dashboards, and activated an automatic job restart on healthy nodes, providing an exceptional level of hardware and system resilience.

MLIPs enable atomistic simulations that combine the fidelity of computationally expensive quantum chemistry with the scaling power of AI.

Yet, developers working at this intersection face a persistent challenge: a lack of robust, Pythonic toolbox for GPU-accelerated atomistic simulation. For use cases such as running a large number of simultaneous, GPU-accelerated simulations, robust and well-supported tools are either missing in the current software ecosystem or are fragmented across several open source software tools.

Over the past few years, available software for running atomistic simulations with MLIPs has been CPU-centric. Core operations such as neighbor identification, dispersion corrections, long-range interactions, and their associated gradient calculation have traditionally supported only CPU computation, which often struggles to deliver the speed that contemporary research demands. High-throughput simulations of small- to medium-sized atomic systems quickly become bottlenecked by inefficient GPU usage in hybrid workflows where the model is GPU-accelerated in PyTorch but the simulation tooling is serial and CPU-based.

While developers have attempted to implement these operations directly in PyTorch over the years, the general-purpose design of PyTorch leaves performance on the table for the specialized spatial and force calculation operations required in atomistic simulation. This fundamental mismatch between PyTorch capabilities and the demands of atomistic modeling raises an important question: What’s needed to bridge this gap?

NVIDIA ALCHEMI (AI Lab for Chemistry and Materials Innovation), announced at Supercomputing 2024, provides chemistry and materials science developers and researchers with domain-specialized toolkits and NVIDIA NIM microservices optimized on NVIDIA accelerated computing platforms. It is a collection of high-performance, batched and GPU-accelerated tools specifically for enabling atomistic simulations in chemistry and materials science research at the machine learning framework level.

NVIDIA ALCHEMI delivers capabilities across three integrated layers:

ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops: A repository of GPU-accelerated, batched common operations for AI-enabled atomistic simulation tasks, such as neighbor list construction, DFT-D3 dispersion corrections, and long-range electrostatics.

ALCHEMI Toolkit: A collection of GPU-accelerated simulation building blocks, including geometry optimizers, integrators, and data structures to enable large-scale, batched simulations leveraging AI.

ALCHEMI NIM microservices: A scalable layer of cloud‑ready, domain‑specific microservices for chemistry and materials science, enabling deployment and orchestration on NVIDIA‑accelerated platforms.

This post introduces NVIDIA ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops, the accelerated batched common operations layer of ALCHEMI. ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops uses NVIDIA Warp to accelerate and batch common operations in AI-driven atomistic modeling. These operations are exposed through a modular PyTorch accessible API (with a JAX API targeted for a future release) that enables rapid iteration and integration with existing and future atomistic simulation packages.

Figure 1 shows the accelerated batched common operations for atomistic simulations included in this initial release of ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops. This beta release includes two versions of neighbor lists (naive and cell), DFT-D3 dispersion correction, and long-range coulombic (Ewald and Particle Mesh Ewald) functions.

Figure 2 demonstrates the performance of accelerated kernels in ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops versus popular kernel-accelerated models like MACE (cuEquivariance) and TensorNet (Warp) to achieve fully parallelized performance and scalability. The blue MLIP baseline allows comparison with advanced features like neighbor lists and dispersion corrections (DFT-D3). Test systems consisted of ammonia clusters of increasing size packed into various cells using Packmol. Timing results were averaged over 20 runs on an NVIDIA H100 80 GB GPU. The DFT-D3 calculation does not include 6Å due to the long-range nature of D3.

ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops ecosystem integration

ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops is designed to integrate seamlessly with the broader PyTorch-based atomistic simulation ecosystem. We are excited to announce in-progress integrations with leading open source tools in the chemistry and materials science community: TorchSim, MatGL, and AIMNet Central.

TorchSim

TorchSim, a next-generation open source atomistic simulation engine, is adopting ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops kernels to power its GPU-accelerated workflows.TorchSim is a PyTorch-native simulation engine purpose-built for the MLIP era, enabling batched molecular dynamics and structural relaxation across thousands of systems simultaneously on a single GPU. TorchSim will leverage our optimized neighbor lists to drive high-throughput batched operations without sacrificing flexibility or performance.

MatGL

MatGL (Materials Graph Library) is an open source framework for building graph-based machine learning interatomic potentials and foundation potentials for inorganic, molecular, and hybrid materials systems. By integrating ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops, MatGL significantly accelerates graph-based treatments of long-range interactions, enabling large-scale atomistic simulations that are both faster and more computationally efficient without compromising accuracy.

AIMNet Central

AIMNet Central is a repository for AIMNet2, a general-purpose MLIP capable of modeling neutral, charged, organic, and elemental-organic systems with high fidelity. AIMNet Central is leveraging ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops to further enhance the performance of its flexible long-range interaction models. Using NVIDIA-accelerated DFT-D3 and neighbor list kernels, AIMNet2 can deliver even faster atomistic simulations for large and periodic systems without compromising accuracy.

Feature highlights

This section dives into three ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops initial features: high-performance neighbor lists, DFT-D3 dispersion corrections, and long-range electrostatic interactions.

Neighbor lists

Neighbor list construction is the backbone of atomistic simulations enabling calculation of energies and forces with local or semi-local MLIPs. ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops delivers state-of-the-art GPU performance in PyTorch, achieving performance scaling to millions of atoms per second for batches of many small to medium atomic systems or single large atomic systems.

Capabilities

Both O(N) (cell list) and O(N²) (naive) algorithms with batched processing

Periodic boundary support for triclinic cells with arbitrary cell dimensions and partial periodicity

Supports end-to-end compute graph compilation

Direct API compatibility with PyTorch

API example

import torch from nvalchemiops.neighborlist import neighbor_list # Water molecule water_positions = torch.tensor([ [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], # O [0.96, 0.0, 0.0], # H [-0.24, 0.93, 0.0], # H ], device=""cuda"", dtype=torch.float32) # Ammonia molecule (NH3) ammonia_positions = torch.tensor([ [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], # N [1.01, 0.0, 0.0], # H [-0.34, 0.95, 0.0], # H [-0.34, -0.48, 0.82], # H ], device=""cuda"", dtype=torch.float32) # Concatenate positions for batch processing positions = torch.cat([water_positions, ammonia_positions], dim=0) # Create batch indices (0 for water, 1 for ammonia) batch_idx = torch.cat([ torch.zeros(3, dtype=torch.int32, device=""cuda""), # Water torch.ones(4, dtype=torch.int32, device=""cuda""), # Ammonia ]) # Define cells for each molecule (large enough to contain them without PBC) cells = torch.stack([ torch.eye(3, device=""cuda"") * 10.0, # Water cell torch.eye(3, device=""cuda"") * 10.0, # Ammonia cell ]) # non-periodic molecule case pbc = torch.tensor([ [False, False, False], # Water [False, False, False], # Ammonia ], device=""cuda"") # Cutoff distance in Angstroms cutoff = 4.0 # Compute neighbor list; here we explicitly request a batched cell list algorithm neighbor_matrix, num_neighbors, shift_matrix = neighbor_list( positions, cutoff, cell=cells, pbc=pbc, batch_idx=batch_idx, method=""batch_cell_list"" ) print(f""Neighbor matrix: {neighbor_matrix.cpu()}"") # [7, num_neighbors.max()] print(f""Neighbors per atom: {num_neighbors.cpu()}"") # [7,] print(f""Periodic shifts: {shift_matrix.cpu()}"")

DFT-D3 dispersion corrections

Realistic molecular modeling must fully account for van der Waals interactions, which standard DFT functionals do not account for systematically. DFT-D3 uses empirical pairwise corrections, leading to substantial improvements in binding energies, lattice structures, conformational analysis, and adsorption studies for common DFT functionals.

Capabilities

Becke-Johnson (BJ) rational damping variant

Supports batched and periodic calculations

Supports smoothing at cutoff distance

Joint energy, forces, and virial calculation

API example

from nvalchemiops.interactions.dispersion import dftd3 batch_ptr = torch.tensor([0, 3, 7], dtype=torch.int32, device=""cuda"") atomic_numbers = torch.tensor( [6, 1, 1, 7, 1, 1, 1], dtype=torch.int32, device=""cuda"" ) # For this snippet, assume d3_params is loaded as: # d3_params = D3Parameters(rcov=..., r4r2=..., c6ab=..., cn_ref=...) # Users can refer to the documentation to source DFT-D3 parameters # and understand the expected data structure d3_params = ... # call the DFT-D3 functional interface energy, forces, coordination_numbers = dftd3( positions=positions, numbers=atomic_numbers, a1=0.3981, a2=4.4211, s8=0.7875, # PBE parameters neighbor_matrix=neighbor_matrix, neighbor_matrix_shifts=shift_matrix, batch_idx=batch_idx, d3_params=d3_params ) print(f""Energies: {energy.cpu()}"") # [2,] print(f""Forces: {forces.cpu()}"") # [7, 3]

Limitations

The current implementation computes two-body terms only (C6 and C8). Three-body Axilrod-Teller-Muto (ATM/C9) contributions are not included. This generally leads to some over-estimation of dispersion energies.

Long-range electrostatic interactions

Accurate modeling of electrostatic interactions is critical for simulations involving ions/charged species and polar systems. Currently, the most common approach for MLIPs is to learn Coulomb interactions within the short-ranged model. Systematic underestimation of long-range Coulombic effects leads to loss of accuracy in binding energies, solvation structures, and interfacial phenomena.

ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops provides fully GPU-accelerated Ewald summation methods—both standard Ewald and particle mesh Ewald (PME)—enabling GPU-accelerated, efficient and accurate treatment of long-range electrostatics in PyTorch.

For large periodic systems, Ewald-based methods separate electrostatic interactions into short-range and long-range components, each computed in the domain best suited for performance. ALCHEMI Toolkit-Ops provides a dual-cutoff strategy that dramatically reduces redundant neighbor queries and memory overhead compared to naive all-pairs approaches, making high-throughput simulations of charged systems practical on modern GPUs. Users can choose between standard Ewald for smaller systems or PME for larger periodic systems, depending on their specific performance and accuracy needs.

Capabilities

Ewald summation method

Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) using B-splines

Supports batched and periodic systems

GPU-optimized computation, leveraging cuFFT for fast reciprocal-space evaluation

PyTorch integration provides native tensor support for end-to-end differentiable workflows

API example

from nvalchemiops.interactions.electrostatics import particle_mesh_ewald # charges for each atom are randomly generated here atomic_charges = torch.randn( positions.size(0), dtype=torch.float32, device=""cuda"" ) # compute energy and forces with particle mesh ewald energy, forces = particle_mesh_ewald( positions, atomic_charges, cells, alpha=0.3, # adjust Ewald splitting parameter batch_idx=batch_idx, neighbor_matrix=neighbor_matrix, neighbor_matrix_shifts=shift_matrix, compute_forces=True ) print(f""Energy: {energy.cpu()}"") # [2] print(f""Forces: {forces.cpu()}"") # [7, 3]

In an online announcement this week, DoorDash said its new app in ChatGPT lets users discover recipes, turn ingredients into shoppable grocery lists and complete purchases through DoorDash’s own app for delivery.

For now, the ChatGPT experience is limited to groceries and select users, the delivery giant said, with broader access and additional categories planned over time. Participating retailers include grocery giants such as Kroger and Safeway, along with regional chains including Wegmans, Bi-Rite, Schnucks and Fairway Markets.

Reaching shoppers earlier in the decision process

More broadly, DoorDash is positioning the integration as a way to reach consumers earlier. This can occur at the moment they’re deciding to make a meal, before they’ve opened a grocery app or typed in a search query.

By showing up inside conversational AI tools like ChatGPT, DoorDash said it’s effectively creating another discovery channel — one that surfaces grocery options in real time and gives consumers and merchants another entry point.

The move follows a similar rollout by Instacart earlier this month. Unlike Instacart’s integration, however, DoorDash’s experience stops short of supporting checkout directly inside the chat.

To get started with DoorDash in ChatGPT, users can go to their account settings, open the “apps” section and sign in to their DoorDash account. From there, DoorDash can be toggled on directly within a chat.

Shoppers can ask ChatGPT for meal or recipe ideas — such as “easy, hearty soups to make for dinner tonight” — and receive tailored recommendations, DoorDash said.

Once a recipe is selected, users can prompt ChatGPT to shop for those ingredients. The app then converts those items into a shoppable grocery list directly within the chat.

When shoppers are ready to place an order, they move into the DoorDash app to review the cart, make changes and complete the purchase from a nearby store. Unlike Instacart’s integration, DoorDash’s experience does not support OpenAI’s Instant Checkout feature.

What DoorDash brings — and what comes next

The launch also comes as OpenAI rolls out its new in-chat app directory. There, users can discover and enable third-party apps, including DoorDash, Instacart and Uber Eats.

DoorDash said its app is currently available to a subset of users and will roll out more broadly in the coming weeks across iOS, Android, desktop and mobile web. The company did not specify which additional categories could follow groceries.

“As we expand this experience to more shopping categories, our focus is on building AI tools that give people time back and make local shopping easier,” said Andy Fang, DoorDash’s co-founder, in a statement.

The timing also coincides with DoorDash’s broader push to scale grocery delivery. In September, Kroger said it would extend its partnership with DoorDash to include full grocery delivery from roughly 2,700 stores in the U.S.

The deal increases DoorDash’s role in Kroger’s third-party delivery mix alongside Instacart and Uber. Kroger ranks No. 6 in Digital Commerce 360’s Top 2000. The database ranks North America’s largest online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales.

Why DoorDash is launching inside ChatGPT now

For grocery and food retailers, the shift marks a move from AI as a discovery tool to more of an execution layer. That shift accelerated in July, when OpenAI introduced its ChatGPT agent framework. The move has fueled experimentation with so-called agentic commerce.

“These new systems can analyze household budgets, scan weekly promotions, suggest recipes, and even check what’s already in your pantry,” wrote Doug Baker, vice president of industry relations at FMI, the Food Marketing Institute, in a recent blog post.

He cautioned that the technology is still early.

“It’s nowhere near perfect yet because the content is not organized,” he said.

But said the pace of change signals how quickly the marketplace could move.

DoorDash’s ChatGPT app follows a separate, but related, step from OpenAI. Earlier this fall, the company opened ChatGPT more broadly to third-party apps, allowing developers to create in-chat experiences that let the AI handle more tasks on users’ behalf.

DoorDash, Instacart, Target and Uber were among the early partners named — a signal that delivery and commerce are emerging as early use cases.

How consumers view AI-assisted shopping

Survey data suggests consumers are increasingly open to using AI to shop, although with clear guardrails.

PwC’s 2025 Future of Consumer Shopping Survey found that 48% of respondents expect their online ordering of groceries and related categories to increase by 2030. Among millennials, that figure climbs to 62%.

Interest in AI-driven shopping is also growing. PwC found that 40% of respondents expect to increase their use of AI to find and compare products. Meanwhile, 33% expect to rely more on AI to make purchases. Among millennials, those figures rise to 54% and 47%, respectively.

Trust, however, remains a constraint. When asked what would make them comfortable letting an AI assistant make purchases, 29% of respondents would want to approve purchases before they happen. Others pointed to safeguards such as a 100% money-back guarantee (28%), the ability to revoke access at any time (25%) or strict spending limits (18%). Still, 32% said they would never trust an AI assistant with their financial access.

Nearly 80% of detections in CrowdStrike’s 2025 Global Threat Report were malware‑free, indicating that attackers relied on other techniques, such as social engineering and stolen credentials, to impersonate legitimate users, bypass controls, and escalate privileges.

[SC Media Perspectives columns are written by a trusted community of SC Media cybersecurity subject matter experts.Read more Perspectives here.]

To better understand the challenges organizations face today, we gathered insights from attendees at three major global cybersecurity conferences in 2025: Black Hat USA in Las Vegas; Infosecurity Europe in London; and the it-sa Expo&Congress in Nuremberg. Across all regions, practitioners cited identity as the new perimeter.

Why all the focus on identity?

Survey respondents consistently reported that identity‑based threats now surpass all other cyber risks. Phishing, credential theft, deepfakes, and privilege misuse ranked ahead of ransomware as the most likely sources of major breaches over the coming year. At Black Hat USA, 45% identified phishing as their primary concern and 41% cited deepfakes. Infosecurity Europe mirrored those results with phishing as the top identity-based threat for 50% of respondents and deepfakes for 42%.

These statistics reflect real‑world, costly incidents. The September 2025 Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) cyberattack demonstrates how identity‑based techniques, including vishing and credential theft, can cripple an organization’s global operations. Threat actors from Scattered Spider, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters infiltrated JLR’s IT environment, causing severe production shutdowns and supply chain disruptions.

Digital identities have proliferated as hybrid, multi‑cloud and AI‑enabled environments expand. Every user, device and non‑human identity (NHI) represents a potential entry point. Outdated authentication methods and incomplete identity governance heighten exposure, making modernization an urgent priority.

AI: a double-edged sword

Cybercriminals now use AI to create more convincing phishing campaigns, generate deepfakes, automate ransomware and escalate privileges at scale.

However, confidence in defending against AI‑enhanced attacks remains low across regions. Only 12% of Infosecurity Europe respondents and 16% at Black Hat USA said their organizations are fully prepared. At it-sa Expo&Congress, readiness was slightly higher at 28%, but nearly one‑third of respondents expressed only partial confidence.

AI‑enhanced attacks are mainstream threats. Financial institutions report AI-driven voice cloning that circumvents authentication, and enterprises face increasingly targeted spear phishing attacks. Low‑level criminals can now impersonate executives with off-the-shelf deepfake tools.

While AI creates new risks, it also unlocks defensive advantages. Organizations adopt AI‑driven identity validation and behavioral analytics to validate identities, detect anomalies and terminate high-risk behavior in real time.

More than half of respondents across all three regions cited AI‑driven validation as the most impactful innovation for identity security, with 53% at Infosecurity Europe, 57% at Black Hat USA and 60% at it-sa Expo&Congress. Organizations that embed AI into identity and access frameworks can potentially gain visibility and resilience. Those that hesitate to adopt AI-enabled technologies risk falling behind amid accelerating threats and rising automation.

The importance of privileged access management

Despite universal agreement that identity has become central to cybersecurity, privileged access controls remain inconsistent. Security leaders know the path forward: strengthen privileged access, enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) and operationalize zero-trust.

Yet gaps persist. Across all three conferences, four in 10 organizations lack consistent MFA enforcement or comprehensive privileged access management (PAM) coverage. At Black Hat USA alone, 40% said their organization does not consistently enforce MFA for privileged accounts.

The February 2024 Change Healthcare attack, which compromised the data of more than 190 million Americans, stemmed from a single server lacking basic MFA. Bridging the divide between awareness and execution demands disciplined processes, continuous measurement and responsible use of AI across every layer of defense.

Achieving cyber resilience requires converting awareness into action. Here's what to do: secure identities, enforce least privilege, and embrace intelligent automation.

Modernizing identity controls and integrating AI thoughtfully into their security stack can help organizations withstand today’s threats and build secure, scalable growth for the future.

The collaboration extends behavioral measurement tools to Shopify's commerce platform, which powers millions of businesses across more than 175 countries.

The partnership addresses friction identification in digital shopping experiences. More than 1.3 million websites worldwide currently use Contentsquare's analytics platform, and the Shopify integration gives merchants access to session replay, heatmaps, zone-based analysis, performance monitoring, and AI-powered insights specifically within checkout flows.

""Shopify gives brands the foundation to grow, and Contentsquare shows them how to make every customer interaction count,"" said Jean-Christophe Pitié, Chief Marketing and Partner Officer at Contentsquare. ""With this partnership, teams finally get full visibility into the moments that drive revenue — and the ones that create friction — so they can fix issues faster and deliver the kind of shopping experience customers actually come back for.""

The technical implementation centers on a new Contentsquare Shopify Partner app that enables data collection without requiring engineering work, custom pixel implementations, or manual tagging plans. Installation occurs through a streamlined process designed for rapid deployment.

Measurement capabilities across checkout infrastructure

The Contentsquare platform captures granular behavioral data throughout Shopify checkout flows. Session replay functionality records individual customer sessions, showing exact navigation paths, click patterns, and points where shoppers abandon transactions. This visual playback capability operates independently of aggregate analytics, providing teams with detailed views of specific user experiences.

Heatmaps display which page elements attract engagement and which areas customers ignore. The zone-based approach breaks pages into discrete components, measuring performance at element-level granularity. Teams can analyze how placement, merchandising strategies, and cross-sell implementations affect engagement and sales outcomes.

Frustration scoring represents a core measurement methodology within the platform. The system detects signals indicating customer struggle, including rage clicks, repeated form field attempts, and error encounters. AI-powered analytics platforms score these frustration indicators, ranking sessions by business impact to prioritize technical resolutions.

Performance monitoring surfaces technical issues affecting revenue. The platform tracks page load speeds, broken elements, and errors that create friction during checkout processes. These signals combine with behavioral data to quantify how technical problems impact conversion rates.

Shopify Plus enterprise brands gain access to journey visualization showing how shoppers browse, search, and navigate across product categories. The complete view spans from first interaction through post-purchase, connecting disparate touchpoints into unified customer paths.

Integration mechanics and data architecture

The Shopify Partner app installation process eliminates traditional implementation barriers that require developer resources. Automatic data capture begins immediately after activation, tracking all interactions within the checkout environment without manual configuration requirements.

Zoning functionality automatically segments each page into measurable components. Teams can examine individual element performance without creating custom tracking specifications. This automated approach reduces the setup time typically associated with granular analytics implementations.

The platform processes event-scoped data, session-scoped measurements, and user-level aggregations. Event data captures specific interactions like button clicks or form submissions. Session data encompasses complete visit sequences. User data tracks behavior across multiple sessions, enabling lifecycle analysis and repeat purchase pattern identification.

Data flows into Contentsquare's analysis infrastructure where AI models process behavioral signals. The system identifies highest-impact optimization opportunities, flagging specific pages, elements, or flows where improvements would generate measurable conversion increases. Teams receive prioritized recommendations rather than undifferentiated data sets requiring manual interpretation.

Voice of customer capabilities integrate survey responses with behavioral data. When customers provide feedback, teams can access session replays showing the exact experience that prompted the response. This connection between qualitative feedback and quantitative behavior enables more precise diagnostic work.

Market context for ecommerce analytics

The Shopify partnership arrives as analytics platforms expand capabilities for measuring digital commerce. Google Analytics expanded ecommerce dimensions and metrics availability in reporting tools on August 25, 2025, addressing limitations in how merchants access product performance data. That enhancement enabled secondary dimensions, filters, comparisons, and customization options for ecommerce measurements that previously remained restricted.

Shopify's platform evolution has emphasized merchant tools and infrastructure components. The company launched Commerce Components on January 6, 2023, providing enterprise retailers with modular access to checkout systems and flexible APIs for custom integrations. That approach allowed retailers to adopt specific Shopify capabilities without migrating entire technology stacks.

More recently, Shopify announced the Product Network on December 10, 2025. The system enables product displays from third-party merchants across multiple storefronts, creating unified checkout experiences. Analytics capabilities within Product Network remain limited in initial documentation, though demonstration materials showed performance tracking across placements and category analysis.

Platform consolidation trends affect commerce infrastructure decisions. Meta phased out Facebook and Instagram shops checkout by August 2025, redirecting transactions to merchant websites. That shift eliminated payment processing responsibilities while maintaining advertising value propositions. For Shopify merchants specifically, Meta indicated order attribution would be temporarily lost during transition periods.

Analytics platform selection increasingly depends on integration depth and measurement granularity. Google Analytics published a reporting playbook in October 2025 addressing platform complexity across five reporting surfaces: Reports, Explore, Advertising, Data API, and BigQuery export. The documentation explained data scope hierarchies spanning user-level, session-level, event-level, and item-level measurements.

Technical specifications and use cases

Session replay within Contentsquare operates through smart capture technology that records all journey data while automatically masking personal information including payment details. Teams can review individual sessions or examine aggregated patterns across customer segments.

Event stream functionality highlights specific moments within replays. The system automatically identifies events affecting business outcomes—form submissions, site errors, checkout abandonment points—and creates timeline markers enabling teams to skip directly to relevant moments rather than reviewing complete sessions.

The platform provides session replay summaries using AI to distill single or multiple user sessions into concise overviews. This condensed format accelerates analysis by presenting key insights without requiring teams to review hours of footage.

Event-triggered recording captures sessions related to specific behaviors. Teams can configure the system to record only sessions containing negative feedback, cart abandonment, or error encounters. This selective approach reduces data volume while ensuring capture of high-priority interactions.

A/B testing analysis connects directly to session replay and heatmap data. When teams run experiments, they can examine why specific variants outperform others by reviewing actual customer behavior within each version. This behavioral context supplements statistical significance measurements with actionable insights about what elements drive performance differences.

Form analysis specifically addresses checkout friction. The platform measures completion rates, identifies frequently abandoned fields, and surfaces confusion indicators. Teams can examine heatmaps showing where customers hesitate or struggle, then access replays demonstrating actual form navigation patterns.

Impact quantification ranks sessions by business consequences. Rather than presenting all sessions equally, the system prioritizes replays where customers experienced significant friction, completed high-value purchases, or represented important segments. This filtering enables teams to focus analytical efforts on interactions with meaningful revenue implications.

Zone-based heatmaps extend beyond click tracking to attribution modeling. The platform calculates exposure rates, click rates, conversion rates, and revenue attribution for each page element. These measurements enable comparisons showing which images, calls-to-action, or product placements generate optimal outcomes.

Side-by-side heatmap analysis supports temporal comparisons, traffic source evaluations, and device-type assessments. Teams can examine how page element performance varies across different time periods, referral sources, or mobile versus desktop contexts.

Broader industry implications

The partnership reflects convergent trends around friction detection, AI-powered analysis, and checkout optimization. Customer experience platforms face mounting pressure to demonstrate clear return on investment. Sprinklr reported implementation difficulties with larger Contact Center as a Service projects on June 4, 2025, resulting in customer dissatisfaction and revenue recognition delays.

Analytical capabilities increasingly differentiate commerce platforms. Data governance challenges create barriers to AI implementation across industries. Research from Publicis Sapient showed 63 percent of energy sector leaders identified poor data quality as a top barrier to drawing insights, while 61 percent of telecommunications executives cited technical data debt delaying customer experience innovation.

The Contentsquare-Shopify integration addresses these concerns through automatic data capture eliminating manual configuration requirements. Clean, structured behavioral data flows into analysis systems without depending on merchant data governance practices.

Platform ecosystems continue expanding analytical tool access. Google Analytics added nine new data sources for cost data import on June 24, 2025, including BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, Amazon S3, and Snowflake. That expansion enabled marketers to consolidate advertising spend data from multiple platforms into unified interfaces.

Similar integration strategies appear across the martech landscape. Optimizely acquired NetSpring on September 30, 2024, bringing warehouse-native analytics capabilities to its experimentation platform. The acquisition enabled customers to connect experimentation activities directly to business metrics stored in data warehouses, processing analysis within existing data infrastructure.

Measurement methodologies emphasize connecting digital interactions to revenue outcomes. Traditional analytics platforms track page views, session durations, and bounce rates as proxy metrics. Behavioral analytics platforms like Contentsquare attempt more direct connections between specific customer actions and conversion events.

This shift from descriptive to diagnostic analytics changes how teams approach optimization. Instead of observing that conversion rates declined, teams can identify which page elements, technical errors, or checkout steps caused the decline. This diagnostic precision accelerates resolution cycles and focuses development resources on highest-impact fixes.

Privacy considerations and data handling

The Contentsquare platform implements automatic personal information masking. Payment card details, banking information, and other sensitive data undergo redaction during session recording. Teams can review customer behavior without accessing personally identifiable information.

Data processing occurs within Contentsquare's infrastructure rather than exposing raw behavioral data to merchant systems. This architecture reduces merchant responsibilities for behavioral data governance while maintaining measurement capabilities.

The platform operates within Shopify's ecosystem, avoiding third-party data sharing concerns that complicate retail media partnerships with external advertising platforms. All transactions and measurements occur within Shopify-managed systems with existing merchant relationships and user consent frameworks.

Cookie consent and tracking permission management remain merchant responsibilities. Contentsquare respects browser-level privacy controls and consent management platform configurations. When users decline tracking, behavioral monitoring ceases.

Implementation timeline and availability

The Contentsquare Shopify Partner app became available on December 17, 2025. Installation requires Shopify Plus for enterprise brands seeking complete feature access across checkout flows. Standard Shopify plans receive experience analytics features across storefronts excluding specific checkout measurement capabilities.

The partnership includes experience monitoring, user lifecycle analysis, and voice of customer features extending beyond checkout. These capabilities apply across the entire merchant storefront, providing comprehensive visibility into customer behavior from site entry through post-purchase.

Merchants using the platform can configure alerting for sudden frustration increases or technical error spikes. These proactive notifications enable rapid response to emerging issues before they significantly impact conversion rates.

The collaboration positions Contentsquare within Shopify's partner ecosystem alongside other analytics, marketing automation, and customer experience vendors. Merchants can combine Contentsquare behavioral insights with complementary tools addressing email marketing, advertising attribution, inventory management, and customer relationship management.

Technical requirements specify JavaScript compatibility and browser cookie support. Mobile app analytics extend to Shopify mobile commerce implementations, capturing touch interactions, swipe patterns, and mobile-specific navigation behaviors.

Data retention policies determine how long session recordings and behavioral measurements remain accessible. Merchants can configure retention periods balancing analytical needs against storage costs and privacy considerations.

Strategic positioning within commerce infrastructure

The announcement reflects Shopify's strategy of expanding merchant capabilities through partner integrations rather than building all functionality internally. This approach enables rapid feature deployment while allowing Shopify to focus engineering resources on core commerce platform development.

For Contentsquare, the partnership provides distribution to Shopify's merchant base. The company already serves more than 1.3 million websites globally, and Shopify represents substantial expansion opportunity within the ecommerce vertical.

Competing analytics platforms include Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics 4, Amplitude, Mixpanel, and Heap. Each platform emphasizes different measurement methodologies—product analytics, marketing analytics, behavioral analytics—creating segmented market positioning.

Session replay capabilities specifically have become standard features across customer experience platforms. However, implementation quality, AI-powered analysis, and integration depth vary significantly. Contentsquare differentiates through automated friction detection and impact quantification rather than providing undifferentiated session recording.

The focus on checkout flows addresses critical conversion points where small improvements generate outsized revenue impacts. Cart abandonment rates typically range from 60 to 80 percent across ecommerce sites, representing substantial recovery opportunities for merchants identifying and resolving specific friction sources.

The partnership arrives during peak shopping season preparation periods when merchants configure analytics and optimization tools for holiday traffic. Timing the announcement for December 17 positions the platform for implementation ahead of 2026 planning cycles.

Reis Nordland was saddled with repetitive customer service requests and the requirement to provide travel data around the clock.

All conversational data, agent telemetry and configuration metadata persist in IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL.","With the initial euphoria surrounding generative AI settling into a more realistic search for ROI, many businesses face the challenge of moving beyond prototypes. An overwhelming majority—95%, according to a recent MIT study—struggle to move from pilot to production with gen AI.

To help its clients buck the trend of high adoption with little to no meaningful business transformation, Frontkom, a Norway-based digital innovation firm, built a scalable, modular AI platform that delivers conversational assistants, search interfaces and retrieval applications for a range of customers—each with different data, scale and governance requirements.

One such client is Reis Nordland, the regional public transport provider for Nordland County in Norway. The company operates bus and ferry services across a vast northern region, managing schedules, ticketing and route information for travelers.

Frontkom developed and delivered a gen AI travel assistant that enables riders to ask natural-language questions, such as “When is the next ferry from Bodø?” or “Is route 300 delayed?” and receive accurate, up-to-date answers from a conversational assistant in multiple languages. Just weeks after launch, the application has cut inquiries to Reis Nordland’s customer service representatives by more than half.

Reis Nordland was saddled with repetitive customer service requests and the requirement to provide travel data around the clock. Frontkom’s conversational AI assistant connects to real-time transit feeds and structured internal data, such as timetables, traffic updates, FAQs and service policies. The goal was to provide factual, context-grounded responses, while keeping operators in full control of the responses a model provides.

This deployment improved traveler experience for the transit service provider, but it also demonstrated a template architecture that Frontkom reuses across other domains, including education, sustainability and municipal services.

To support rapid iteration while maintaining control and observability, Frontkom built a component-based architecture centered on IBM technologies and open-source tooling.

At the front end, a lightweight embeddable chat widget—built with JavaScript and React—integrates directly into the Reis Nordland website and mobile applications. This widget is paired with a secure dashboard interface built on Supabase, allowing Reis Nordland operators to manage their AI agents, datasets and knowledge bases from a single, user-friendly console.

The orchestration layer is powered by Langflow, IBM’s low-code visual environment for building AI agent applications. Langflow manages the logic, prompt design and response shaping behind each AI agent. This enables Frontkom to update components, including LLMs, data connectors or workflows, independently without affecting production stability.

After some research, the Frontkom team settled on the Gemini 2.5 Flash model for Reis Nordland’s use case. Should new or different models (or tools) become more appropriate in the next six months, updating will be a simple task, thanks to Langflow’s drag-and-drop modularity.

Langflow runs on Frontkom PaaS, a Kubernetes-based infrastructure hosted on AWS. It uses Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB) to maintain reliability under variable traffic loads. A Fastly CDN sits in front of the system to ensure fast global delivery for both end users and administrative interfaces.

All conversational data, agent telemetry and configuration metadata persist in IBM Cloud Databases for PostgreSQL. This choice provides both scalability and governance, with version control that tracks every flow and dataset used in production

Reis Nordland’s assistant now handles thousands of daily interactions, providing travelers with fast, multilingual responses. Updating the app is a far simpler process; The team can roll out new features or datasets in hours rather than weeks.

Support tickets have dropped significantly: in the first week alone, the new system resolved over 1,300 support tickets, prompting Reis Norland to describe its AI assistant as a “very valuable employee.” And the results keep getting better.

Four weeks after launch, the number of inquiries to the customer center decreased by 37% compared to last year. After six weeks, that statistic improved to 55%. At the same time, customer center response times were cut nearly in half (to about one day), despite fewer resources for manual answering. This is a result of fewer inquiries, as the chatbot is taking on the burden of answering many questions.

More importantly, the same architecture is being reused for other Frontkom clients—demonstrating that production-grade gen AI is repeatable when the foundation is modular, observable and governed.

With capital markets set for a slowdown through the year-end holidays, corporate issuers are laying the groundwork for a potential roadshow launch in early 2026 when the IPO market kicks back into action.

Fuel distributor ARKO Petroleum and drug developer Aktis Oncology also publicly filed paperwork for a New York IPO on Friday.

U.S.-listed IPOs have raised $75.3 billion as of December 17, the biggest yearly haul since 2021, according to data from Dealogic.

""We expect the rebound to continue in 2026, in part because there's a lot of recent news of private companies planning 2026 IPOs,"" said Nicholas Einhorn, director of research at Renaissance Capital, a provider of IPO-focused research and ETFs.

Northridge, California-based MiniMed, whose offerings range from insulin delivery devices to glucose monitors, was founded in 1983 by Alfred Mann and bought by Medtronic in a nearly $3.3 billion deal in 2001.

The diabetes unit has grappled with regulatory concerns over quality management and cybersecurity issues related to its certain devices in the recent years, but has since returned to growth.

In May, Medtronic said it planned to spin off its diabetes unit through an IPO, followed by a subsequent split-off.

MiniMed reported a net loss of $21 million on net sales of $1.48 billion in the six months ended October 24, compared with net loss of $23 million on net sales of $1.30 billion a year earlier.

Goldman Sachs, BofA Securities, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are the lead underwriters for the IPO. MiniMed, which has tapped more than 10 underwriters for the offering, will list on the Nasdaq under the symbol ""MMED"".

Over the last few months, Mr. Trump has announced similar agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.
To help patients navigate that process, the Trump administration plans to create a site called TrumpRx.gov, which will direct patients to the manufacturers’ direct-buy websites.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose punishing tariffs on imported medicines but has not followed through.
The agreements also stop short of regulation that would force drugmakers to lower their prices, an approach Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully in his first term.","President Trump on Friday announced deals with nine pharmaceutical companies to reduce some drug prices, the latest step in his bid to try to align U.S. costs with the lower drug prices in European countries.

Mr. Trump has now reached deals with 14 of the 17 drugmakers to which he sent letters in July demanding that they lower prices. The nine companies participating in Friday’s announcement are Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Roche’s Genentech unit, Gilead, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi.

Drugmakers have been eager to strike voluntary deals with the administration in hopes of avoiding punitive regulatory action that could cut deeply into their profits. Over the last few months, Mr. Trump has announced similar agreements with Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

The three major drugmakers that have yet to announce deals with the administration are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron. Alexandra Bowie, a spokeswoman for Regeneron, said her company was still in talks with the administration.

Under the arrangements, the manufacturers will offer some of their drugs through websites where Americans can bypass insurance and use their own money to buy the products.

To help patients navigate that process, the Trump administration plans to create a site called TrumpRx.gov, which will direct patients to the manufacturers’ direct-buy websites. Officials put up a promotional version of the TrumpRx website this fall and said they plan for it to be operational in January.

The drugmakers also agreed to sell most of their products to state Medicaid programs, which provide health insurance for low-income Americans, at the prices they offer to other wealthy countries.

Medicaid is already legally required to get the lowest drug prices in the United States, which are often comparable to those in European countries. But administration officials said the deals would bring significant savings for some drugs.

The drugmakers also said they would introduce new medicines in the United States at prices comparable to what they ask other wealthy countries to pay.

In exchange, the companies secured three-year exemptions from any tariffs that Mr. Trump might impose on imported pharmaceuticals, administration officials said. Mr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose punishing tariffs on imported medicines but has not followed through.

In the United States, prices for brand-name drugs are three times as high, on average, as those in peer nations. Mr. Trump has long complained that the United States is unfairly subsidizing lower prices in European countries, a view echoed by many pharmaceutical executives.

The deals announced on Friday do not address the high costs of most drugs already on the market covered under private insurance or other government health insurance programs like Medicare. Those costs are borne by U.S. employers and consumers who pay in the form of taxes, health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.

The agreements also stop short of regulation that would force drugmakers to lower their prices, an approach Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully in his first term.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/19/multimedia/19hs-drug-pricing-twjb/19hs-drug-pricing-twjb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 17:02:02.735831

The House Judiciary Committee has contacted JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and BNY Mellon, demanding financial records related to Epstein’s accounts and transactions.","Two class-action lawsuits against Bank of America and BNY Mellon could shed new light on how convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein allegedly financed his abuse network, and the role major financial institutions may have played in enabling it.

The lawsuits, filed by an anonymous Jane Doe plaintiff, accuse the banks of ignoring red flags, failing to report suspicious transactions and, in doing so, providing Epstein with the financial infrastructure needed to sustain his operation.

However, at a motions hearing Monday, a federal judge expressed skepticism, suggesting he may dismiss them before they go to trial unless the lawyers revise their cases with more specific details about their allegations.

RELATED STORY | Lawmakers threaten legal action over delayed Epstein files release

The lawsuit against Bank of America alleges the company ""knowingly provided the financial support and the veneer of institutional legitimacy"" that allowed Epstein to operate under the ""guise"" of legitimate business activity.

The complaint claims the bank failed to file required Suspicious Activity Reports, or SARs, despite signs that Epstein’s financial behavior warranted closer scrutiny. The lawsuit describes that failure as ""wrongful and purposeful.""

Trial attorney Stacy Schneider, who is not involved in the case, told Scripps News in an interview that excessive cash withdrawals are a well-known trigger for mandatory reporting under federal banking regulations.

""Jeffrey Epstein apparently had so many excessive high cash withdrawals that it was causing some suspicion with the banks,"" Schneider said. ""And what happens when someone is doing excessive cash withdrawals is the bank is required to file an SAR, which is a suspicious activity report.""

A separate class-action lawsuit against BNY Mellon makes similar allegations, asserting the bank had a ""plethora of information"" about Epstein's operation.

EPSTEIN TIMELINE | From arrest and death to push for public release of DOJ files

The filing claims Epstein's crimes were enabled not only by his personal wealth and influence, but through ""access to funding and financial support from both individuals and institutions, including B-N-Y.""

""The bank could face severe penalties from the federal government for not doing proper reporting of suspicious activity,"" Schneider told Scripps News. ""But proving what was suspicious and what isn't suspicious is done by a case-by-case basis.""

Both Bank of America and BNY Mellon have asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuits, calling the claims “threadbare and meritless.”

The cases come amid mounting scrutiny of Wall Street’s past relationships with Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.

The recent litigation follows major settlements by other financial institutions accused of overlooking Epstein’s conduct.

JPMorgan Chase agreed last year to pay $290 million to sexual abuse survivors who alleged the bank ignored warnings about Epstein’s behavior, though the bank did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement.

Deutsche Bank also reached a $75 million settlement, acknowledging it made a ""critical mistake"" in taking Epstein on as a client.

The House Judiciary Committee has contacted JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and BNY Mellon, demanding financial records related to Epstein’s accounts and transactions. Lawmakers allege the banks failed to take action for years, even as warning signs mounted.

A source familiar with the investigation confirmed to Scripps News that the Committee did receive responses from each bank, though they were largely non-responsive to the Committee’s questions. When pressed about whether they would provide documents, the banks either refused to answer or declined to do so absent a subpoena.

Committee Ranking Member Rep.

""Am I excited for OpenAI to be a public company? In some ways, I am, and in some ways I think it'd be really annoying,"" Altman said on an episode of the ""Big Technology Podcast"" published Thursday.

Leadership seems to be one of the sticking points for Altman: ""Am I excited to be a public company CEO? 0%.""

""It's wonderful to be a private company,"" Altman said, but he added that OpenAI needs lots of capital and is going to ""cross all of the shareholder limits and stuff at some point.""

""I do think it's cool that public markets get to participate in value creation,"" Altman said.

Altman cofounded OpenAI alongside eleven others in 2015, and the company's value has soared since the launch of its AI-powered chatbot, ChatGPT, in 2022.

ChatGPT has 800 million weekly users, and the company has inked $1 trillion worth of deals with tech giants like Oracle, Nvidia, and AMD.

In October, the company reached a $500 billion valuation after a secondary share sale, briefly overtaking Elon Musk's SpaceX to become the most valuable private company in the world, a crown that SpaceX regained in recent days.

The Information reported on Wednesday that OpenAI is seeking to raise billions more at a $750 billion valuation.

There are signs the company is preparing for a potential IPO. In October, Reuters reported that OpenAI is considering filing with securities regulators as soon as the second half of 2026.

But asked during the podcast if OpenAI would IPO next year, Altman responded, ""I don't know.""

Trump this month said he would allow sales of Nvidia's H200 chips to China, with the US government collecting a 25 per cent fee, and that the sales would help keep US firms ahead of Chinese chipmakers by cutting demand for Chinese chips.

The move drew fire from China hawks across the US political spectrum over concerns the chips would supercharge Beijing's military and erode the US ‍advantage in artificial intelligence. But questions have remained about ⁠how ‍quickly the US might approve such sales and whether Beijing would allow Chinese firms to purchase the Nvidia chips.

The US Commerce Department, which oversees export policy, has sent license applications for the chip sales to the State, Energy and Defense Departments ⁠for review, the sources said on condition of anonymity because the process is not public.

Those agencies have 30 days to weigh in, according to export regulations.

One of ‍the sources, an administration official, emphasised the review would be thorough and ""not some perfunctory box we are checking"".

But under the regulations, the final decision rests with Trump.

The start of the inter-agency licensing review has not been reported previously. The Commerce Department and Nvidia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A White House spokesperson did not comment on the review, but said ""the Trump administration is committed to ensuring the dominance of the American tech stack – without compromising on national security"".

BIDEN HAD BANNED ADVANCED AI CHIP SALES TO CHINA

The Biden administration had imposed a raft of restrictions on advanced AI chip sales to China and countries it ‌feared could become conduits for smuggling into the rival nation, citing national security fears.

Trump's move represents a departure from that policy and a dramatic reversal from his first term, when he drew international attention by cracking down on Chinese ‍access ‌to US technology. Back then, he cited claims that Beijing steals American intellectual property and harnesses commercially obtained technology to bolster its military, which Beijing denies.

Exporting large numbers of the chips to China would be ""a significant strategic mistake"", said Chris McGuire, a former White House National Security Council official under President Joe Biden and senior fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations.

McGuire described the chips as ""the one thing holding China back in AI"".

""I cannot possibly fathom how the departments of Commerce, State, Energy, and Defense could certify that exporting these chips to China is in ‌the US national security interest,” he said.

Led by White House AI czar David Sacks, several members of the Trump administration now argue that shipping advanced AI chips to China discourages Chinese competitors like Huawei from redoubling efforts to catch up with Nvidia's and AMD's most-advanced chip designs.

Reuters reported last week that Nvidia was considering an increase in production of the H200, the immediate predecessor to its current flagship Blackwell chips, after initial orders from China outstripped the current capacity.

While the H200 chips are slower than Nvidia's Blackwell chips at many AI tasks, they remain in wide use in the industry and have never been allowed for sale in China.

Trump had previously opened the door to sales of a less-advanced version of Nvidia's Blackwell chips, its cutting-edge offering, but backed away from the ‌move and approved sales of the H200 instead.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--qp2d4c8B--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-12-19T013853Z_1_LYNXMPELBI02N_RTROPTP_3_USA-CHINA-NVIDIA.JPG?itok=lZInAkcT",N,,2025-12-19 16:05:35.475525

While Nvidia wants to secure GPU demand from the next generation of AI applications, Alphabet’s CapitalG aims to push AI tools that could challenge traditional software monopolies.","Stockholm-based AI startup Lovable has some admirers, with two of them being tech heavyweights Nvidia and Google.

The vibe coding noob has closed a $330 million Series B funding round, catapulting the company to a healthy $6.6 billion valuation. This figure represents more than triple the company’s worth from five months ago, when it was valued at $1.8 billion following its July funding round. The round was led by CapitalG (Alphabet’s venture arm) and Menlo Ventures, with participation from Nvidia’s NVentures, creating an alliance of AI powerhouses.

Back in 2023, this Swedish startup was founded by Anton Osika and Fabian Hedin, and has since become one of the fastest-growing companies in tech history. Lovable reached $200 million in annual recurring revenue last month, achieving this milestone in under a year after hitting its first $1 million in ARR. With fresh funding exceeding $500 million raised in 2025 alone, Lovable is probably loving life.

I’m worth billions in prizes

Behind Lovable’s meteoric rise lies vibe coding—an approach that transforms simple text descriptions into fully functional applications. Users can generate complete websites or applications by typing casual prompts into a chatbot interface, with no coding knowledge required.

Numbers from the announcement reveal Lovable’s user base creates over 100,000 new applications daily, with more than 25 million projects built on the platform in its first year. Major enterprise customers including Klarna, Uber, and Zendesk are already using the platform, with some teams reducing development time from six weeks to just three hours.

Investment frenzy

The funding announcement signals a massive shift in how tech giants view AI development tools. Nvidia’s investment strategy focuses on backing startups it considers game changers and market makers to expand the AI ecosystem. The company has already participated in 50 venture capital deals this year, surpassing its entire 2024 activity.

Market data from earlier this quarter shows vibe coding exploding across the board. Combined valuations of leading startups in this space grew 350% year-over-year, jumping from roughly $7-8 billion in mid-2024 to over $36 billion in 2025. Competitor Cursor raised $2.3 billion at a $29.3 billion valuation last month, while Replit hit a $3 billion valuation in September.

Strategic positioning reveals competing interests converging around this Swedish startup. While Nvidia wants to secure GPU demand from the next generation of AI applications, Alphabet’s CapitalG aims to push AI tools that could challenge traditional software monopolies. When these competing tech giants agree on backing the same company, something transformative is clearly happening.

Sweet software development

The announcement arguably represents more than just another AI success story—it validates a fundamental shift in how software gets built. The company’s mission to become “the last piece of software” companies ever need to buy reflects growing demand for platforms that eliminate traditional development bottlenecks.

The platform addresses the global shortage of skilled programmers by transforming millions of non-technical users into developers. When you examine the implications, Lovable has transformed a latent market of tens of millions of people into developers.

Enterprise adoption signals are undeniable. Lovable’s demand from Fortune 500 companies signals a fundamental shift in how software gets built. The company plans to use its new funding to enhance collaboration and governance capabilities, add more third-party software integrations, and application hosting features.",https://assets.techrepublic.com/uploads/2025/12/Love-2-Adobe.jpeg,N,,2025-12-19 16:05:40.084690

About original equipment manufacturers

Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are companies that design, manufacture, and sell complete vehicles under their own brand names. Because they bring complete vehicles to market, unlike component suppliers and aftermarket manufacturers, OEMs bear full regulatory responsibility for their products, meaning they must ensure compliance with safety standards, emission regulations, and other governmental requirements across their operating markets. The designation “original” reflects the fact that OEMs are primary brand owners and market-facing entities.",https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2649488227-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 14:02:14.662934

""With BioMarin's unwavering commitment to patients, along with greater resources and scale, Amicus' medicines will reach even more patients around the world, faster.

The boards of both companies unanimously approved the agreement, and Amicus' board of directors unanimously recommended that Amicus' stockholders vote to adopt the agreement.1

""Amicus, like BioMarin, is a company that has been profoundly dedicated to transforming care for patients with rare diseases since its founding, developing and bringing to market important therapies for individuals living with Fabry disease and Pompe disease. BioMarin's scale of operations, including our global commercial footprint and industry-leading, in-house manufacturing capabilities make the combination of these companies an exceptional strategic fit,"" said Alexander Hardy, president and chief executive officer of BioMarin.

What benefits will the acquisition bring BioMartin?

Amicus’ acquisition aims to strengthen BioMarin's commercial portfolio by adding two new treatments to the company's existing portfolio of medicines targeting lysosomal storage disorders, including Galafold, the first oral treatment for Fabry disease, and Pombiliti in combination with Opfolda , a two-component therapy for Pompe disease.1 Based on the recently announced Galafold litigation settlements, BioMartin is expected to have exclusivity for Galafold through January 2037.

BioMartin can also add DMX-200 (another treatment that Amicus has rights to in the U.S.). The drug is a potential first-in-class investigational small molecule for the treatment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a rare and fatal kidney disease currently in Phase III development.

The acquisition is also expected to increase BioMarin's long-term compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 and beyond, as both Galafold and Pombiliti plus Opfolda hold high-growth potential having generated a combined net product revenue of $599 million over the past four quarters.1

Following the closing of the agreement, it is expected to add revenue immediately, being accretive to Non-GAAP Diluted EPS in the initial 12 months after close, with substantial accretive beginning in 2027.1 Strengthening its cash flow generation and its commitment to deleveraging, BioMarin is targeting gross leverage above two and half times within two years after close.

""Immediately upon close, this transaction is expected to accelerate BioMarin's revenue growth and strengthen our financial outlook, delivering significant value to patients, employees and stockholders. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Non-GAAP Diluted EPS in the first 12 months following close,"" said Hardy.

What are the financial details of the agreement?

Per the terms of the agreement, BioMarin will acquire Amicus for a price of $14.50 per share, in an all-cash transaction, which represents a 33% premium to Amicus' last close, a 46% premium to the 30-day volume-weighted average stock price, and a 58% premium to the 60-day volume-weighted average stock price, for a total equity value of upwards of $4.8 billion.1

""I am enormously proud of our Amicus team. Together with our partners in the rare disease community, we created a truly patient-centric biotech and successfully developed two transformative medicines for people living with rare diseases, which impacted the lives of more than 3,400 patients around the world,"" said Bradley L. Campbell, president and chief executive officer of Amicus. ""With BioMarin's unwavering commitment to patients, along with greater resources and scale, Amicus' medicines will reach even more patients around the world, faster. We are confident that this agreement is in the best interests of our shareholders by providing compelling, certain and premium value, and will accelerate progress for the rare disease community.""

From the article:

IBM’s data strategy for the AI era included multiple changes to longstanding approaches, enabling it to build what (Vice President and Chief Data Officer Ed) Lovely calls an integrated enterprise data architecture. For example, the company retained the concept of data owners but “helped them understand that the data is an IBM asset, and if we’re able to democratize it in a controlled, secure way, we can run the business in a better, more productive way,” Lovely says.

As a result, IBM moved from multiple teams managing siloed data to a common team using common standards and common architectures. Enterprise leaders also consolidated 300 terabytes of data, selecting needed data based on the outcomes the company seeks and the workflows that drive those outcomes. ...

Rethink Data Ownership

“Traditional models that treat data ownership as a purely IT issue no longer work when business units, product teams, and AI platforms are all generating and transforming data continuously,” (research manager for IDC’s Global DataSphere) Adam Wright explains. “Ideally, clear accountability should sit with a senior data leader such as a CDO, but organizations without a CDO must ensure that data governance responsibilities are explicitly distributed across IT, security, and the business.”

It’s critical to have “a single point of authority for defining policies and a federated model for execution, so that business units remain empowered but not unchecked,” he adds.

The approval allows PLSE to begin a multicenter clinical trial evaluating its proprietary Nanosecond Pulsed Field Ablation (nsPFA) technology, marking an important regulatory milestone for the cardiac portfolio.

For investors, the IDE clearance de-risks the clinical pathway, builds on encouraging European feasibility data and positions PLSE to generate meaningful U.S. clinical evidence that could support broader adoption and future commercialization.

Likely Trend of PLSE Stock Following the News

Following the announcement, the company's shares closed flat at yesterday’s market closing. Shares of the company have lost 4.5% in the year-to-date period compared with the industry’s 16.4% growth. The S&P 500 has gained 14.8% in the same time frame.

Over the long run, the FDA IDE approval strengthens PLSE’s business by advancing its nPulse system toward U.S. commercialization in the fast-growing AF ablation market, while validating its differentiated nanosecond PFA technology versus competing microsecond-based systems. Successful execution of the study could generate pivotal clinical data to support regulatory approval, drive physician adoption and establish PLSE as a next-generation ablation platform with potential workflow, safety and durability advantages, ultimately expanding revenue opportunities.

PLSE currently has a market capitalization of $966.4 million.

More on the News

The FDA IDE approval enables Pulse Biosciences to formally launch its NANOPULSE-AF study, a single-arm, multicenter, prospective trial designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the nPulse Cardiac Catheter Ablation System in patients with recurrent, drug-resistant paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The study plans to enroll up to 145 patients across as many as 30 sites, including leading centers in the United States and three sites outside the country, giving PLSE broad geographic exposure and clinical diversity. The trial’s design aligns with regulatory expectations for early-stage cardiac device validation and represents a meaningful step forward in PLSE’s U.S. clinical strategy.

A key differentiator highlighted in the announcement is PLSE’s use of nanosecond pulsed field ablation, which delivers substantially lower total energy compared with traditional microsecond PFA systems. Management believes this approach may further reduce collateral damage to surrounding cardiac structures while maintaining effective lesion formation. The nPulse catheter is also engineered to create a complete circumferential pulmonary vein isolation lesion in a single energy application, eliminating the need for repeated repositioning and stacked lesions — an advantage that could simplify workflows, reduce procedure times and improve consistency in real-world EP labs.

Importantly, the IDE builds on encouraging clinical momentum in Europe, where PLSE’s ongoing feasibility study has already enrolled 150 patients with follow-up underway. Positive early outcomes from that experience provide real-world validation for the technology and help de-risk the U.S. study. With strong support from prominent electrophysiologists and plans to share follow-up data in 2026, PLSE is positioning its nsPFA platform as a next-generation ablation solution that could enhance safety, procedural efficiency and durability, key attributes that matter for long-term adoption and commercial success.

Favorable Industry Prospects for PLSE

Per a report by Grand View Research, the global atrial fibrillation market size was estimated at $26.89 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $65.33 billion by 2033, registering a CAGR of 10.44% from 2025 to 2033.

The atrial fibrillation market is driven by a growing disease burden, rapid technological evolution in treatment and diagnostics and the shift toward remote patient monitoring.

Other Recent Development for PLSE

Recently, PLSE announced that it initiated a research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to test its nPulse technology — Vybrance — for treating malignant thyroid tumors. The FDA has given approval for PLSE’s IDE application so they can commence human trials. The clinical trial is scheduled to begin in early 2026 and will enroll 30 patients across two sites.

This data center project is part of the Stargate data center project by OpenAI and Oracle, which aims to deliver more than 5GW of computing capacity.
This move meant that DTE Energy did not have to go through a lengthy hearing, wherein opposing groups could seek expert testimony and present evidence to challenge DTE’s claims.
This ready-to-serve provision in the power agreement helps ensure the power utility’s expenditure on additional infrastructure to support the AI data center will not be passed on to the average consumer.
Furthermore, if the data center fails to pay for its energy costs, DTE cannot pass them on to other consumers.","The Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) has given DTE Energy permission to deliver 1.4 gigawatts of power to a planned data center that will be built in Saline Township, about 40 miles southwest of downtown Detroit. This data center project is part of the Stargate data center project by OpenAI and Oracle, which aims to deliver more than 5GW of computing capacity. According to the Detroit Free Press, DTE filed an “ex parte” motion with the MPSC to get the nod for its contract without contest, with the commission voting 3-0 for its approval.

This move meant that DTE Energy did not have to go through a lengthy hearing, wherein opposing groups could seek expert testimony and present evidence to challenge DTE’s claims. Many residents are concerned that this massive project would cause electricity prices to spike and affect the water quality in the area — issues that several U.S. senators are also looking into. On the other hand, the utility company argued that it didn’t need to prove that this project would affect energy prices for local residents, especially as a 2024 state law prevents data centers from passing on energy costs to the community to qualify for preferential tax treatment.

Aside from this, DTE’s contract with Green Chile Ventures, an Oracle subsidiary, requires that the latter will pay 80% of the contracted capacity, whether or not it actually uses it. This ready-to-serve provision in the power agreement helps ensure the power utility’s expenditure on additional infrastructure to support the AI data center will not be passed on to the average consumer. The contract will also last for at least 19 years, giving the power provider ample time to recoup its expenses from the data center and not from the community. Furthermore, if the data center fails to pay for its energy costs, DTE cannot pass them on to other consumers.

Despite these mechanisms, opponents of the plan were still dismayed about not being heard. “I, along with everyone here… probably don’t feel like they’ve been publicly served today. When you make these decisions, you’re eliminating the very necessity of what public service bodies are all about,” Wendy Albers, a resident of nearby Augusta Township, told the MPSC. “I appreciate the protections you put in place, but I just don’t trust them.”",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dGxeQZ7bfxsrBwxMCC4r7N-1920-80.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 13:02:11.937698

Customers deserve stronger, more connected freight rail, and our merger will make that happen.” Mark George, president and CEO of Norfolk Southern, said, ““This combination will bring together Union Pacific’s expansive Western reach and Norfolk Southern’s unparalleled access to Eastern manufacturing and population centers in an end-to-end combination.
Based in Atlanta, Georgia, US, Norfolk Southern moved 18,107 carloads of grain and grain mill products in 2024, according to its weekly performance reports.
If a merger does occur, grain shippers could benefit from single-line service, the USDA noted.

The railroads first announced they had entered into a merger agreement on July 29, and the board of directors of both companies unanimously approved the transaction. It is subject to STB review and approval within its statutory timeline. The companies are targeting early 2027 for closure.

“We look forward to working with the Surface Transportation Board as it reviews our historic application to create America’s first transcontinental railroad,” said Jim Vena, chief executive officer of UP, based in Omaha, Nebraska, US. “As time and technology continue to transform how freight is delivered, our industry must keep pace and move forward, reaching underserved markets with new rail solutions and strengthening the US supply chain. Customers deserve stronger, more connected freight rail, and our merger will make that happen.”

Mark George, president and CEO of Norfolk Southern, said, ““This combination will bring together Union Pacific’s expansive Western reach and Norfolk Southern’s unparalleled access to Eastern manufacturing and population centers in an end-to-end combination. It will create a cohesive freight rail solution with 50,000 route miles that connect 43 states and more than 100 ports.”

Union Pacific transports about 1.3 billion bushels of grain annually, with exports accounting for 30% to 40% of those shipments, according to the company. The railroad serves most of the US major grain markets, connecting the Midwest and Western production areas to export terminals in the Pacific Northwest and Gulf Coast, as well as Mexico. It also serves significant domestic markets, including grain processors, animal feeders and ethanol producers in the Midwest and West.

Based in Atlanta, Georgia, US, Norfolk Southern moved 18,107 carloads of grain and grain mill products in 2024, according to its weekly performance reports. Agriculture products shipped include soybeans, wheat, corn, feed, flour and ethanol.

Faster, more comprehensive freight service to US shippers by eliminating interchange delays, opening new routes, expanding intermodal services, and reducing distance and transit time on key rail corridors are key components of the merger, the companies said.

The US Class I rail network is divided so that no single railroad reaches from the East Coast to the West Coast. Cross-continental rail traffic must interchange between railroads, and Chicago, Illinois, US, is the main interchange point, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

If a merger does occur, grain shippers could benefit from single-line service, the USDA noted. However, the combination also could result in less competition where merging railroads overlap.

Novo Nordisk on Thursday said it filed an application for U.S. approval of CagriSema, its weekly injectable for obesity. Earlier this year, the Danish drugmaker disappointed investors when the drug, a combination of an amylin-targeting medicine and semaglutide, missed the mark in a closely watched late-stage study. Still, its application is based on data from that trial, which found that patients shed an average of 23% of their body weight over 68 weeks, as well as a secondary study. Novo hopes to position CagriSema as a follow-up to the success of Wegovy, and to take the edge off the threat of its competitor Eli Lilly, which recently submitted an application for approval of its oral GLP-1 orforglipron. It would be the first amylin-targeting and GLP-1 combination on the market if approved. — Gwendolyn Wu

Camp4 Therapeutics, an RNA-targeting biotechnology company, has inked a deal with GSK worth as much as $440 million to make medicines for neurodegenerative and kidney diseases. In a Thursday announcement, Camp4 said GSK would hand over $17.5 million in upfront costs, and could pay tiered royalties if any of the programs that emerge from the collaboration are commercialized. The partnership is focused on antisense oligonucleotide drugs that boost gene expression, which could be beneficial in genetic disorders caused by loss of function. Camp4 also announced the pricing of a $30 million public stock offering on Thursday. — Gwendolyn Wu

A San Francisco-based AI drugmaker, Chai Discovery, has raised $130 million in a Series B financing to support its ambitions of speeding up the drugmaking process. The company claims its technology can predict how biochemical molecules interact with one another and find new ways to pursue “hard-to-drug” targets. Its investor syndicate included Oak HC/FT and General Catalyst, which co-led the round, as well as others such as Thrive Capital, OpenAI and Yosemite. Chai raised its $70 million Series A funding just four months ago. — Gwendolyn Wu

A combination of Merck & Co.’s immunotherapy Keytruda and the Pfizer/Astellas antibody-drug conjugate Padcev succeeded in another bladder cancer study, helping people who are otherwise eligible for chemotherapy live longer than those who got chemo, the companies said Wednesday. Trial enrollees had muscle-invasive bladder cancer that hadn’t spread outside the bladder, and were undergoing surgery with curative intent. Participants were randomized to receive either Keytruda and Padcev before and after surgery or platinum-based chemo before surgery. Trial investigators then measured event-free survival, overall survival and remission rates. Beyond stating that the Keytruda-Padcev combination had a “statistically significant and clinically meaningful” benefit on those three measures, the companies didn’t release specifics but said they will disclose data at a coming medical meeting. The combination has also improved survival for those who can’t receive chemotherapy as well as those whose disease spread beyond the bladder. — Jonathan Gardner",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/EK5xKj0ydykvmwFmBqsauREtdhrHAUsAiyI6JgDkO1s/g:nowe:0:0/c:1207:682/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNDgzOTIxNzkzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-12-19 14:02:01.585346

The decision comes after VRG50635, the company’s lead asset for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), failed a pre-specified efficacy analysis in a phase 1 trial, Effie Bruzik, Verge’s vice president of operations, told Fierce Biotech.

“A no-go decision was made,” Bruzik said, so the trial was terminated and did not advance to an open-label extension stage. On clinicaltrials.gov, the reason given for the termination is “lack of risk-benefit data.”

The move away from VRG50635 leaves a preexisting deal with Ferrer in limbo. The Spanish pharma licensed the ex-U.S. rights to the ALS asset in March 2024 in a pact potentially worth more than 112.5 million euros (then worth roughly $121.7 million).

Bruzik did not respond to questions from Fierce Biotech about the status of Verge’s deal with Ferrer. At the time of publication, Ferrer had not responded to Fierce's request for comment.

With no more candidates in the clinic, Verge is pivoting to focus solely on its machine learning drug discovery platform Converge, Bruzik added.

“Recent breakthroughs in AI foundation models has meaningfully increased demand for Verge’s multi-modal human datasets in the last 18 months, and we see a clear opportunity to drive industry-wide impact by enabling partners to improve pipeline success rates,” Bruzik said.

Verge intends to use a “leaner cost structure” and continued investment in its technology to scale up Converge as a means to achieve “sustainable profitability,” Bruzik explained. The company plans to divulge more details on the “strategic re-focus,” including new hires, early next year, she said.

VRG50635 itself was originally discovered with Converge, and the tech company’s success at bringing an AI-discovered candidate into the clinic earned Verge a spot on the Fierce 15 list in 2022.

ID28,Levi Strauss,2025-12-19 16:04:39+00:00,Technology Record | The best of enterprise solutions from the Microsoft partner ecosystem,How Microsoft is helping businesses turn AI and data into real-world impact,Alice Chambers,,,,,https://www.technologyrecord.com/article/how-microsoft-is-helping-businesses-turn-ai-and-data-into-real-world-impact,"In agriculture, Land O’Lakes, a farmer-owned cooperative, built its Oz assistant on models within Azure AI Foundry to provide fast, accurate, mobile-friendly responses to agricultural questions.
These companies aren’t just deploying tools, they are embedding intelligence into every workflow, decision and process to amplify insight across their business.” Microsoft identifies four key trends that set frontier companies apart from others.
The company built Ask Ralph, an AI-powered conversational styling companion using Azure AI.
“With the Microsoft AI tools, we put a lot of power in the hands of our employees.
“In financial services, for example, we’re helping partners like BlackRock modernise operations by re-architecting its Aladdin platform on Azure AI,” says Taylor.","When a client requests an urgent fund transfer, financial advisors need instant access to account details and approvals, as delays can affect revenue and client trust. The same urgency applies to farmers, who must decide the optimal time to harvest to maximise yields, and to warehouse operators, who rely on real-time insights to manage stock and keep supply chains flowing. In every sector, speed, accuracy and actionable data – and the intelligence to interpret it – are more than just operational concerns, they are key to organisations achieving a competitive edge in fast-moving markets.

“Across every industry, generative and agentic AI are deriving insights from data and redefining how organisations operate, compete and grow,” says Alysa Taylor, chief marketing officer for commercial cloud and AI at Microsoft.

In finance, investment banking firm UBS is innovating with AI through its Smart Technologies and Advanced Analytics Team (STAAT), which combines advanced data analytics with machine learning to power intelligent insights. Built on Microsoft Azure, STAAT Assist automatically extracts key client information and populates transfer requests, enabling advisors to review and approve them with a single click, surfacing opportunities and speeding up the client experience. In agriculture, Land O’Lakes, a farmer-owned cooperative, built its Oz assistant on models within Azure AI Foundry to provide fast, accurate, mobile-friendly responses to agricultural questions. Meanwhile, American clothing firm Levi Strauss & Co. is using an Azure-native orchestrator agent embedded in Microsoft Teams to coordinate multiple subagents, enabling employees across corporate, retail and warehouse environments to access fast, accurate answers to questions like ‘what are the upcoming corporate holidays?’, ‘what is the travel and expense policy?’ and eventually ‘how do I process a return for an online order?’.

“These are examples of what we call ‘frontier firms’,” says Taylor. “They are organisations blending human ambition with AI-first innovation to maximise their potential and impact on society. These companies aren’t just deploying tools, they are embedding intelligence into every workflow, decision and process to amplify insight across their business.”

Microsoft identifies four key trends that set frontier companies apart from others.

“First, they empower employees to automate repetitive work so they can focus on creativity and strategy,” explains Taylor. “Second, they reimagine customer engagement through personalised, data-driven experiences. Third, they transform business processes for greater accuracy, speed and efficiency. Fourth, they accelerate innovation by bringing new product and experiences to market faster.”

One practical example comes from Lucerne Cantonal Hospital in Switzerland. Working with Microsoft and partner Polypoint, the hospital built an AI-powered shift-scheduling solution within Teams to cut planning time by two-thirds and free up caregivers to focus on patient care. Before the solution, nurses described creating monthly schedules for three daily shifts, seven days a week as “a game of Tetris”, where moving one cell triggered a cascade of adjustments.

More than 100 nurses spent two to three days each month organising these schedules. With AI handling the planning, staff now have time to provide better patient care and manage their teams more effectively.

“We have too few nurses and too much work, so if there is a way to give time back to the nurses, we want to do it,” says Michael Döring, the hospital’s chief nursing officer.

Frontier firms like Lucerne Cantonal Hospital are seeing measurable results, achieving up to three times higher returns from AI investments than late adopters, according to Taylor.

“This isn’t just about efficiency, it’s about unlocking new markets, business models and revenue streams,” she says. “AI is transforming how organisations engage with customers through personalisation at unprecedented scale. Ralph Lauren is a powerful example. The company built Ask Ralph, an AI-powered conversational styling companion using Azure AI. It delivers real-time outfit recommendations, styling tips and gift ideas, turning every customer interaction into a data driven, high-margin engagement that deepens loyalty and drives new revenue opportunities.”

German automotive manufacturer Mercedes Benz is using Azure AI to optimise its global production network across more than 30 plants.

“Innovation is deeply rooted in our DNA and fast forward to today, AI for us is our best colleague,” said Daniela Dimitrova, chief information officer at Mercedes, at Microsoft Ignite 2025. “With the Microsoft AI tools, we put a lot of power in the hands of our employees. We are bringing AI to the factory floor so we can analyse production data and improve efficiency across our factories.”

For example, Mercedes employees are alerted when there is a decrease in efficiency and can ask Digital Factory Chat, a self-serve platform to investigate the cause and analyse potential machine malfunctions. By deploying the AI solution, Mercedes reduced energy consumption by more than 20 per cent.

Mercedes is not alone in realising these kinds of gains; organisations across different sectors are accelerating similar outcomes and entering new markets with the support of Microsoft partners.

“Our partner ecosystem is the force multiplier,” says Taylor. “Partners design and build AI apps and agents, stand up secure data foundations, deploy and manage solutions at scale, and co-sell through our programmes and marketplace so customers realise value faster. That end-to-end motion – from advising on strategy to operating the solution – is how customers move from pilots to production and unlock new growth.”

For example, in the highly regulated life sciences sector, pharmaceutical company Hetero needed more than a basic infrastructure upgrade – it required a secure, scalable foundation that could support AI-driven insights and streamline complex quality and compliance processes. Working closely with Hetero and its subsidiary Audree Infotech, Cloud4C deployed a cloud-native architecture on Azure, addressing long-standing challenges around data fragmentation, manual reporting and operational bottlenecks.

The new architecture gave Hetero a single environment capable of supporting advanced analytics, automation and real-time decision making across 11 manufacturing plants. By modernising its core systems and introducing AI-powered workflows for root cause analysis and quality control, Hetero has cut infrastructure costs by 40 per cent, automated more than 4,000 documents each month and saved 13,500 working hours.

“Cloud4C’s work with Hetero is a clear example of partner-led transformation that improves operations and creates headroom to enter new markets,” says Taylor.

Hetero’s shift to a unified cloud architecture demonstrates the first step every organisation must take in bringing data into one governed, accessible environment so AI can generate meaningful impact.

“We’re starting to see a new set of technology patterns take shape across every sector,” says Taylor. “They’re not tied to a single product or workflow but to a fundamental shift in how organisations operate. The companies leading in this era of frontier firms aren’t just experimenting with AI; they’re embedding it into every workflow, decision and product.

“They’ve shifted from running IT to running intelligence. Cloud and AI are no longer technology choices; they’re becoming the business model itself. That’s exactly what Microsoft Foundry was designed for. It’s a unified Azure platform-as-a-service that brings together everything organisations need to build, customise and deploy AI solutions at scale.

Foundry enables teams to design and manage intelligent applications and agents that unlock insights from data, generate meaning at scale and continuously improve through iteration.”

Working with Foundry, Microsoft Fabric was built to break down siloed data and provide organisations with a single, unified view across all operations.

“At its core is OneLake, a logical data lake that provides a consistent, secure foundation for discovery, sharing and policy enforcement, enabling teams to collaborate on one trusted source of truth,” says Taylor.

Fabric also integrates a range of database services – including Azure HorizonDB, Azure DocumentDB, SQL Database and Cosmos DB – so organisations can run workloads across hybrid and multi-cloud environments without switching platforms. And with Azure Copilot, teams can manage specialised agents across the cloud lifecycle, streamlining AI-powered workflows and data-driven insights so products move from concept to market more efficiently.

Customers can use Microsoft’s broad library of AI models – from Microsoft, OpenAI, Hugging Face, Meta and Anthropic – to build customer copilots, autonomous agents or enhance their apps.

“This is all about deepening our commitment to bringing the best infrastructure, model choice and applications to our customers,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and CEO of Microsoft, when speaking about the addition of Anthropic’s Claude to Foundry. Now, Azure is the only hyperscaler to offer both OpenAI and Anthropic models to empower organisations to build the best possible AI applications. Across industries, Microsoft ensures its AI solutions meet the specific challenges and regulatory requirements each sector faces.

“These technology patterns – unified cloud foundations, secure AI integration and domain-specific copilots – are repeatable across industries,” says Taylor. “Whether in healthcare, manufacturing or retail, we help organisations apply the same architecture to streamline supply chains, ensure compliance and accelerate innovation. By tailoring our approach to each industry’s unique needs, we enable companies to deploy AI responsibly at scale while driving measurable business impact.

“In financial services, for example, we’re helping partners like BlackRock modernise operations by re-architecting its Aladdin platform on Azure AI,” says Taylor. “Aladdin Copilot allows analysts and portfolio managers to query complex financial data in natural language and get immediate, actionable insights, all within a secure, fully governed workflow that meets strict compliance requirements.”

The AI pattern for BlackRock integrates model reasoning, data orchestration and compliance checks within a single, governed workflow, ensuring every insight meets strict financial regulations. This means financial services professionals can get accurate replies when asking questions like ‘what is my exposure to companies building AI processors?’. For Microsoft, the real opportunity isn’t just using AI but about embedding intelligence into the DNA of a business.

“That’s when transformation truly happens,” explains Taylor. “It’s how organisations unlock new value, reshape processes and set the pace for what’s next. And this is exactly where our partners play a critical role. They bring deep industry expertise and an understanding of each customer’s unique challenges, helping them apply AI in ways that create measurable impact. Together, we’re not just deploying technology, we’re helping every organisation reimagine what’s possible and build the future of their industry.”

Partner perspectives

Three Microsoft partners share how they are helping customers leverage Microsoft technologies and AI tools to unlock new markets, create innovative products and reach audiences more effectively

“At Cisco, we’re enabling our customers to unlock new value by integrating advanced AI and Microsoft technologies into every workspace,” says Snorre Kjesbu, senior vice president and general manager of collaboration at Cisco. “With innovations like RoomOS 26 and our partnership on the Microsoft Device Ecosystem Platform, organisations can harness secure, AI-powered collaboration across Microsoft Teams Rooms and Webex.”

“The Public Key Infrastructure industry is undergoing massive change,” says John Murray, vice president of sales for the Americas at GMO GlobalSign. “To prepare for it, GlobalSign customers are shifting from traditional certificate payment models to new options such as subject alternative name (SAN) licensing. We use Copilot to help quickly and accurately summarise unique SAN values per certificate, replacing time-consuming pivot table work and enabling precise license recommendations.”

“At Intermedia, we’re helping organisations get more from their Microsoft investments by unifying communication and collaboration into one intelligent experience,” says Mark Sher, senior vice president or product marketing at Intermedia. “Our Intermedia Intelligent Communications platform, Unite, integrates with Microsoft Teams so users can connect with customers and colleagues through high-quality voice, SMS and contact centre interactions without leaving Teams.”",https://www.technologyrecord.com/Portals/0/EasyDNNnews/6754/TechnologyRecord-outnow-spread-975x548-1-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 12:04:51.362961

The mixed verdict came after almost eight hours of deliberation, following a three-day trial.
The charges stem from Feb. 22, when hundreds of people gathered in the CHS auditorium for a legislative town hall organized by the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee.
Defense counsel for Trouette argued that he could not have committed any crimes by touching or detaining town hall attendees because he was acting at the sheriff's behest.
Forsgren testified that she was leaving the town hall when she saw Trouette and two other men drag Borrenpohl into the hallway.","COEUR d'ALENE — A Kootenai County jury found that security company owner Paul Trouette battered two people who spoke out when a woman was dragged from a chaotic legislative town hall at Coeur d'Alene High School, but committed no crimes against the woman herself.

The six-person jury voted unanimously Thursday to convict Trouette of two counts of battery against Gregg Johnson and Sarah Forsgren, as well as security agent uniform and duties violations, all misdemeanors.

Jurors found Trouette not guilty of two additional counts of battery against Teresa Borrenpohl and Ben Stallings. They also acquitted him of two counts of false imprisonment related to his detainment of Borrenpohl and Johnson during the town hall. The mixed verdict came after almost eight hours of deliberation, following a three-day trial.

""Justice was done,"" said Ryan Hunter, chief deputy prosecutor for the city of Coeur d'Alene.

Trouette and his attorney hurried out of the courtroom after hearing the verdict. They declined to comment.

The charges stem from Feb. 22, when hundreds of people gathered in the CHS auditorium for a legislative town hall organized by the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee.

Defense counsel for Trouette argued that he could not have committed any crimes by touching or detaining town hall attendees because he was acting at the sheriff's behest. In Idaho, sheriffs have the authority to command citizens to aid them in the execution of their duties.

Prosecutors contended that this immunity did not apply to Trouette because Norris gave him no specific commands to remove or detain anyone.

Witnesses said the atmosphere was tense as the event got underway, with people in the audience cheering, jeering and speaking out of turn in response to legislators.

Ben Stallings testified that Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris directed him to leave the auditorium after he spoke out of turn. He complied, but when he paused to wait for his visually-impaired wife, he said Trouette and another security guard put their hands on him.

Trouette and three employees of his business, Lear Asset Management, provided security services for the event. No contract existed between the company and the KCRCC; instead, Trouette said, he provided the services on a volunteer basis.

Prosecutors said Trouette violated city ordinances requiring him to have a contract authorizing him to perform security work on behalf of a third party and to wear a uniform clearly identifying him as a security guard. Trouette and the other security personnel wore plainclothes during the event and never identified themselves as security when attendees asked who they were.

Video recordings showed Norris approached Borrenpohl after she spoke out of turn and told her to leave the event. When she refused, he took hold of her arm and tried to pull her from her seat, then threatened to pepper-spray her. He then directed security personnel to remove her.

The men hauled Borrenpohl from her seat and wrestled her to the ground. One sat on top of her, while another knelt on her back. She said they twisted her limbs and pulled her hair.

""It was incredibly painful,"" she testified this week. ""I was just trying to keep my airway open.""

With Trouette's help, the men dragged Borrenpohl out of the auditorium by her arms as many people cheered. She lost her shoes, and her shirt came up, fully exposing her bra.

Johnson, who rose from his seat near Borrenpohl and stepped aside at Norris' direction, told the court he was alarmed to see the men force Borrenpohl to the ground.

""Hey, leave her alone,"" he said.

Norris said those words ""encouraged"" Borrenpohl to ""keep resisting,"" so he grabbed Johnson and threatened to arrest him. He marched Johnson out of the auditorium, soon joined by Trouette. The pair pushed Johnson against a wall, kicked his legs to force them open and restrained his hands behind his back.

Forsgren testified that she was leaving the town hall when she saw Trouette and two other men drag Borrenpohl into the hallway. She said she told the men to get their hands off Borrenpohl.

That was when Trouette approached her. Video footage showed him pushing her into a wall. The two struggled briefly as Trouette appeared to try to turn Forsgren around to restrain her hands.

Hunter said he believes the jury put considerable thought and effort into reaching their decision.

""I'd be hard-pressed to say I'm not a little disappointed,"" he said. ""I'm mostly disappointed for the victims named in the not guilty verdict. At the same time, I respect the jury's verdict.""

The jury's decision, while mixed, was a victory for prosecutors.

""This is a good outcome,"" Hunter said.

Sentencing in the case will take place at a later date. The combined charges carry a maximum possible sentence of two years in jail and fines of up to $4,000.",https://hagadone.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/12/18/PaulTrouette_t1200x630.JPG?b488907419a4f4bb2699a58f7dac3d0615975bd7,N,,2025-12-19 13:01:56.177163

GPT-5.2-Codex is designed to perform tasks that normally require a lot of time and human coordination.
Thanks to context compaction, GPT-5.2-Codex can execute multi-step processes without losing track.
GPT-5.2-Codex can interpret screenshots, technical diagrams, and user interfaces more accurately and translate that information into working code.
On benchmarks that measure realistic software development, such as SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0, GPT-5.2-Codex achieves the highest scores to date, according to OpenAI.","OpenAI has released GPT-5.2-Codex, a new version of its agentic AI model for software development that focuses specifically on professional software engineering and cybersecurity.

The model builds on GPT-5.2 but has been further optimized to work independently within complex development environments. With this release, OpenAI is positioning Codex not just as a programming assistant but as a broader support technology for the entire software development process.

GPT-5.2-Codex is designed to perform tasks that normally require a lot of time and human coordination. The model can analyze, modify, and maintain large codebases, while summarizing relevant context concisely to continue working consistently over time. This makes it suitable for refactoring, migrations, and other major code changes that often occur in enterprise environments.

According to OpenAI, the model can improve existing applications without adding new functionality, for example by reducing memory usage or optimizing performance.

GPT-5.2-Codex can perform multi-step processes

An important technical difference from previous Codex versions is its improved handling of long and complex tasks. Thanks to context compaction, GPT-5.2-Codex can execute multi-step processes without losing track. Integration with development tools and terminals has also been further refined, making the model more reliable in realistic development scenarios. In addition, explicit attention has been paid to better support for Windows environments, a frequently cited limitation of previous AI development tools.

OpenAI also emphasizes the model’s improved visual capabilities. GPT-5.2-Codex can interpret screenshots, technical diagrams, and user interfaces more accurately and translate that information into working code. This makes it possible to convert software designs and mockups into functional prototypes more quickly, which is particularly relevant for teams in which design and development work closely together.

Cybersecurity is a central part of the announcement. OpenAI states that advances in programming logic and reasoning directly translate into better support for security research.

Earlier this year, a security researcher used an earlier version of Codex to analyze a known React vulnerability. During that process, several new security vulnerabilities were discovered, which were then responsibly reported. According to OpenAI, examples like these show how AI can help accelerate defensive security work, such as bug detection, testing, and mitigation.

At the same time, OpenAI acknowledges that these capabilities also carry risks. That is why the company has opted for a controlled rollout. GPT-5.2-Codex is now available to paying ChatGPT users via the Codex CLI and IDE extensions, among others. Access via the API will be expanded in phases. In addition, OpenAI is launching an invitation program for trusted security professionals, focused on defensive applications within cybersecurity.

On benchmarks that measure realistic software development, such as SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0, GPT-5.2-Codex achieves the highest scores to date, according to OpenAI. This underscores the company’s claim that the model is not only theoretically stronger, but also performs better in practice on real development and management tasks.",https://www.techzine.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2463475985.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 13:02:18.119217

Wall Street could be missing opportunities to gauge executive sentiment toward AI, and with it potential signals about corporate demand for the technology.","Wall Street is asking technology companies a lot of questions about how artificial intelligence is being developed and financed. It’s showing less curiosity about how other companies are using it, even as business customers in the US alone spent $86 billion this year on AI systems.

Fewer than half the companies in the S&P 500 Index received questions from analysts about generative AI on earnings calls in 2025, according to an analysis of call transcripts by Bloomberg News. In the most recent quarter, when more than 80% of tech companies in the index were asked about AI, the topic was put to just under a third of S&P 500 companies overall.

The scant questions about AI may come as a surprise three years into a $30 trillion bull run for the S&P 500, the start of which coincided with the debut of ChatGPT. The release of the OpenAI chatbot invited stark predictions that AI would revolutionize office work, customer service and other business operations.

“I’m shocked anybody can host an earnings call and not talk about it right now or not be asked about it by an investor,” said Heath Terry, global head of technology and communications research at Citigroup Inc. “To me it’s one of — if not the most important question — that you should be asking a company because if they don’t have a strategy for this, they’re probably going to get left behind.”

Bloomberg’s review of more than 7,000 earnings call transcripts, performed with the help of a large-language model, tallied questions about AI meant to mimic or augment human abilities to think, reason, solve problems, make decisions or complete complex tasks. The analysis excluded questions about factory automation, self-driving vehicles, and leases or funding for data centers.

Energy and utility providers — along with select industrials, materials companies and real estate firms — are getting questions about how they’ll profit from the massive infrastructure investments required to power and house new AI capacity. But these companies are rarely pressed by analysts on how they’re using AI themselves.

Management teams in sectors including finance and real estate are starting to get more questions about their AI strategies. But that line of inquiry remains rare.

Typically on earnings calls, analysts prioritize what they consider to be the biggest or most immediate concerns for the companies they follow.

Outside of tech, AI “doesn’t really matter that much, it’s not big enough to move the needle,” said Ohsung Kwon, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo & Co.

That may change, though.

In a recent Bloomberg Intelligence survey of more than 600 senior executives from large companies across nine sectors, predictions for a high degree of disruption from AI came from every industry represented in the poll. And respondents from five sectors — financial services, media and cable, hospitals, pharmaceuticals and telecoms — said the impact of AI would include a “high” or “very high” near-term rise in operating costs.

Excluding firms that are building the AI industry, US companies spent an estimated $86 billion on the technology in 2025, according to Rick Villars, vice president at market research firm IDC. Next year, that sum is expected to surge to $131 billion.

Analysts are asking the architects of the AI industry, who are spending many times that amount to build the technology, to demonstrate a path to financial returns on their investment. On calls with companies in other sectors, however, they often seem to be searching for use cases.

Most AI discussion, when it comes up during the question-and-answer portion of earnings calls for non-tech companies, relates to adoption and development. Some analysts are asking about expected returns and spending plans tied to AI. Management, meanwhile, is more likely to bring up productivity gains associated with the technology.

Wall Street could be missing opportunities to gauge executive sentiment toward AI, and with it potential signals about corporate demand for the technology. As veterans of the dot-com bust remember, information from users can help investors judge the correct pace and scale for the expansion of a new technology.

“The internet ultimately was game changing, but what caused the bubble to grow and then burst was there was too much investment too fast. People weren’t adopting the tech quickly enough,” said Bloomberg Intelligence equity strategist Gillian Wolff.

The same danger exists with AI, she said. “Not that it won’t ultimately be game changing, but that there could be too much investment right now and investors are going to demand ROI faster than people are willing to adopt — that’s probably the biggest risk.”",https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2025-wall-street-ai-questions-beyond-tech/img/social_gfx.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 17:02:13.359105

That same day, The Leader posted a story on their Facebook about Senedd (The Welsh Parliament) politicians getting a £12,000 pay increase. This received a meagre 84 comments of outrage in comparison.

How strange?

'Who are the real scroungers?'

My 40-year-old friend, whom I won't name, has been on Universal Credit for three months. Whilst still actively looking for work, he has been struggling financially.

He lives near Chester Zoo, is a Flintshire local, and described the reaction as 'mental'.

""I'm not sure what the problem is?"" he said.

""If they're online complaining about less fortunate kids going to the zoo, they've got too much time on their hands. Access to places like Chester Zoo isn’t just leisure; it’s educational, cultural, and supports children’s development.

""UC often leaves families with very little disposable income after rent and bills. A day out at the zoo could be impossible without support.""

Of his own experiences on Universal Credit, he told me: ""The main thing is, as a person living on my bill, I get just under £720 a month, and my rent is £625. I have to go to regular meetings and demonstrate that I'm applying for jobs.

""With papers like The Daily Mail avoiding millions of tax a year and not paying their share, it's very rich how they attack people. Who are the real scroungers?

""Private schools enjoy tax‑funded privileges far greater than any UC claimant. Why are they paying less tax than public schools?""

Universal Credit myths

Many of the comments on the Facebook post seemed to convey the same general sentiment here and there.

Let's take a closer look at them.

“People on benefits are unemployed"" No, over 40% of Universal Credit claimants are in work.

""People choose to be on benefits"" No, as my friend demonstrated, Universal Credit is well below the poverty line; who'd want to be on that?

""Claiming benefits is easy"" No, the PIP or ESA process is an extremely lengthy one. A lot of people who should have a right to the benefit are often rejected.

""People need to budget better"" No, despite what 50p Lee (Anderson) claims, the cost of living has shot up by 22% in the last four years. Making it extremely hard for people in general to get by, let alone people on benefits.

The bean soup theory truly is a depressing reality. ""We're letting kids in for £1, ""BUT WHAT ABOUT ME I'M 78!""

Hang Lung Properties, the blue‑chip landlord that owns Fashion Walk, declined to comment on individual leasing matters.
Since 2021, however, H&M has streamlined its Hong Kong footprint from 13 stores to three: Fashion Walk in Causeway Bay, Festival Walk in Kowloon Tong and Tsuen Wan Plaza.

The Swedish fashion group said it remains committed to the Hong Kong market, will continue serving customers online at hm.com, and is actively exploring new, suitable locations while optimising its retail network.

In a statement attributable to an H&M spokesperson, the company said: “Due to the expiration of our lease agreement, H&M’s Fashion Walk store in Hong Kong will officially close on 21st February, 2026. We remain committed to the Hong Kong market and will actively explore new and suitable locations to serve our customers locally while gradually optimising our retail network. Our customers will continue finding the best H&M has to offer in our stores in Hong Kong or shop online at hm.com.”

Positioning Hong Kong as a key city within the Greater Bay Area (GBA), H&M said it will upgrade its GBA presence through an enhanced store portfolio delivering elevated product offerings and brand experiences tailored to local customers. “Looking ahead, H&M will continue to accelerate its growth across Greater China, including Hong Kong and the Greater Bay Area, by opening new stores in key cities and locations, upgrading high‑potential existing stores — such as the Shenzhen 1234 Space renovation this summer — and optimising our store network for long‑term profitability and relevance,” the spokesperson added.

Market sources indicate the Causeway Bay premises, historically one of H&M’s most prominent Asian locations, will be subdivided and re‑let. Local health and beauty group Lung Fung is understood to be in advanced talks for about 10,000 square feet on the ground floor at a reported monthly rent above HK$1.2 million, with the basement and upper floors to be marketed separately. Hang Lung Properties, the blue‑chip landlord that owns Fashion Walk, declined to comment on individual leasing matters.

Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.64 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for U.S. Bancorp has grown since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to fall in the near-term but traders should be aware that more shares are being shorted.

Comparing U.S. Bancorp's Short Interest Against Its Peers

Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.

According to Benzinga Pro, U.S. Bancorp's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 0.80%, which means the company has more short interest than most of its peers.

Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.

GPT-5.2-Codex is now available for paid ChatGPT subscribers.","OpenAI has released GPT-5.2-Codex, a groundbreaking advancement in AI-driven software engineering and defensive cybersecurity.

This new model represents a significant leap forward in agentic capabilities, designed to handle complex, long-horizon tasks that previously required sustained human oversight.

The most advanced coding model to date, GPT-5.2-Codex, is optimized for developers and security researchers working on extended projects.

Unlike earlier iterations that excelled only at short code snippets, this version maintains context through entire workflows.

The model uses context compaction technology to preserve memory across long sessions, enabling it to handle large-scale code refactors, migrations, and feature implementations without losing focus on core objectives.

Enhanced Performance and Capabilities

GPT-5.2-Codex demonstrates exceptional performance on industry-leading benchmarks, including SWE-Bench Pro and Terminal-Bench 2.0.

The model also features improved support for Windows environments and significantly stronger vision capabilities.

These enhancements enable the AI to interpret technical diagrams, UI screenshots, and architectural documentation to automatically generate functional prototypes.

The architecture’s ability to understand complex visual inputs makes it particularly valuable for security professionals analyzing system designs and threat landscapes.

This visual comprehension extends beyond simple screenshots to include a comprehensive interpretation of technical documentation.

Revolutionary Impact on Vulnerability Research

The most significant advancement lies in cybersecurity applications. OpenAI reports substantial improvements in threat detection and vulnerability analysis capabilities.

A real-world case study illustrates this potential: security engineer Andrew MacPherson from Privy used GPT-5.1-Codex-Max to investigate the React2Shell vulnerability (CVE-2025-55182).

By guiding the AI agent through standard defensive workflows, including setting up a local test environment and fuzzing for malformed inputs, MacPherson’s team uncovered previously unknown vulnerabilities in React Server Components.

These discoveries were responsibly disclosed to the React development team.

GPT-5.2-Codex significantly strengthens these capabilities. The model achieves substantially higher accuracy in professional Capture-the-Flag competitions that simulate authentic cyberattack scenarios.

This improved performance in CTF environments directly translates to enhanced real-world vulnerability detection and threat analysis.

OpenAI acknowledges the dual-use nature of powerful AI tools, recognizing that such systems can support both defensive security research and malicious activities.

Consequently, the company is implementing a cautious deployment strategy with additional safeguards.

Kmet and Johnson — along with kicker Cairo Santos — are the only players remaining from the Bears’ last playoff team in 2020.
“This is what you dream about — the opportunity to play prime-time football, a rivalry game, playoff implications, seeding implications.
It’s also an indication of how new these dynamics are and how, collectively, the Bears still need to gain experience within big games.","This might sound wild to the long-timers at Halas Hall, who know all too well the struggles of a Chicago Bears franchise that’s almost 15 years removed from its last postseason victory and more than three decades past the team’s last stretch of three consecutive playoff seasons. But Bears newcomer C.J. Gardner-Johnson has never known anything other than this current existence. Important late-season games. A big stage. So much at stake. In line to be playoff-bound.

“It’s cool to know you’ve played meaningful football with a good group of guys every year,” Gardner-Johnson said Wednesday, his attention locked in on Saturday night’s spotlight game against the Green Bay Packers. “When you get to this stage, the focus level dials up a little more. You start to realize and feel that dynamic of win or go home.”

Gardner-Johnson is nearing the end of his seventh NFL season. Each of the previous six has included a trip to the postseason. Three appearances with the New Orleans Saints, one with the Detroit Lions, two with the Philadelphia Eagles.

Gardner-Johnson has been to the Super Bowl twice. He lost the first to the Kansas City Chiefs, a scar that still hasn’t fully healed. But he finally won the big one with the Eagles last winter, a 40-22 triumph over Kansas City in New Orleans.

So, yes, he is qualified to speak on the dynamics these Bears have stormed into.

“This,” Gardner-Johnson said, “is where teams separate themselves from good to great. And the way you’re locked in, you put all the focus on what’s going to help you continue to win. And you take care of your teammates.”

Center stage

The Bears find themselves in an interesting and unfamiliar place in mid-December, currently the No. 2 seed in the conference with a half-step on Green Bay in the chase for the NFC North championship. That’s why the meaning of Saturday night’s game has become so heightened.

For many inside the locker room, this is new territory. Defensive tackle Andrew Billings, for example, is in his eighth season and, through various roller-coaster rides with the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns, Las Vegas Raiders and Bears, he has never known the existence of playing for a team with 10 victories. He and Bears coach Ben Johnson talked about just that earlier this week.

“If you’re someone who hasn’t experienced it a whole lot, you’re just grateful,” Johnson said. “You’re grateful for this.”

Receiver DJ Moore, Year 8, has also never been on a team that finished above .500 before this season. “People say the lights get brighter around this time,” Moore said. “I can’t wait to see that and be a part of it.”

Tight end Cole Kmet and cornerback Jaylon Johnson? They were the headliners of the Bears’ 2020 draft class. Which means that they are playing for their fourth head coach in their sixth season together.

Kmet and Johnson — along with kicker Cairo Santos — are the only players remaining from the Bears’ last playoff team in 2020. But even that felt little like this. That squad started the season 5-1, skidded to an 8-8 finish, backed into the 7 seed in the NFC and got blown out in the playoffs.

That was also during the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning the biggest crowd the Bears played for was 5,240 during an October road win at the Carolina Panthers. The attendance for the wild-card round in New Orleans was capped at 3,000.

This is not that. The buzz leading up to Saturday night is exploding.

“I’m excited about this, man,” Kmet said. “I’m really excited. This is what you put all the work in for, for these types of games. Obviously, we want to go in here and win the game. But there will definitely be a moment where you take it in. I’m sure Soldier Field is going to be rowdy. Saturday night. A lot of playoff implications. This is why you do it.”

‘No pressure’

At the start of this week, Ben Johnson dismissed the idea of galvanizing his players with a direct pep talk on the significance of Saturday night.

Bears-Packers. Soldier Field. First place on the line.

“There doesn’t need to be much of a message here this week,” Johnson said. “They know. They know what’s at stake.”

On Thursday, the Bears coach zoomed out a little, acknowledging the need for a carpe diem mentality. Johnson coached in playoff games with the Lions the last two seasons, and Detroit was alive for a postseason berth into the final hours of the 2022 season. But before that, Johnson, too, had been a part of an inordinate amount of losing across his previous 10 seasons with the Lions and Miami Dolphins.

Johnson is fully aware of what the Bears have set themselves up to be a part of. “You want to take advantage of the opportunity,” he said. “You just don’t know when it’s going to happen again. That’s the nature of the NFL.”

Jaylon Johnson dismissed the suggestion that these Bears will have to respond favorably to pressure over the final three weeks of the regular season and beyond.

“Respectfully,” he said, “we ain’t got no pressure. Everybody else was telling us we were not supposed to be here. So for us it’s just sticking true to what we know we can do and who we are.”

The Bears have a handful of veteran players who understand what is ahead, both with this critical closing stretch of regular-season games and then, hopefully, with playoff action.

Captain Joe Thuney, for example, has won four Super Bowls. Kevin Byard is pushing to play in the postseason for the sixth time. Grady Jarrett reached the Super Bowl as a rookie with the Atlanta Falcons — and lost in overtime to Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.

Jarrett isn’t hiding his eagerness for Saturday night,

“This is what you play football for,” he said. “This is what you dream about — the opportunity to play prime-time football, a rivalry game, playoff implications, seeding implications. … You can’t ask for a better moment.”

Juice squeeze

Still, Jarrett’s push to the team is to keep things simple. “It’s just believing we are built for this moment,” he said. “It’s getting back to the basics, especially late in the season, knowing we don’t have to reinvent the wheel.”

In front of his locker after Thursday’s practice, Kmet was asked to describe the electricity of being in this position with nothing but big games left on the docket.

“The juice of this is not maybe as heightened as you think it would be,” he said. “I think everyone in here has a really good demeanor. We’ve taken this approach of going game to game.

“I think going into the last game that we played against (Green Bay), I thought there was more juice going into the week. Like, almost too much — to where I felt like maybe there was a little pressing going on early in the game. Then you get in there at halftime, and you realize this is football. That’s all it is.”

That’s valuable perspective. It’s also an indication of how new these dynamics are and how, collectively, the Bears still need to gain experience within big games.

Gardner-Johnson has been there and done that.

“I thrive in big games,” he said. “You find that balance of being able to be assertive in making an impact without going outside the team.”

When Gardner-Johnson arrived at Halas Hall in October, he immediately sensed positive vibes in the locker room. Those have only heightened over the past eight weeks. So, too, has the sense of purpose.

“To get to that biggest stage, you have to be locked in,” Gardner-Johnson said. “The teams that get there understand that all criticism around this time of year is great criticism. … You’re also aware of the margin for error. It’s small. And it’ll jump up and bite you if you’re not careful.”

To that end, as weird as it sounds, the Bears have leaned into their flaws as a strength. Heading into a meaningful weekend, they’re also now feeding off the energized anticipation that has been created. “This,” Gardner-Johnson said, “is going to be fun. That’s how it’s supposed to be.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/09193735/GettyImages-2245871211-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-19 13:01:58.821563

The FTC says Instacart misled shoppers about “free delivery,” satisfaction guarantees, and automatic enrollment into its Instacart+ subscription program.

A proposed court order would bar the company from deceptive pricing and subscription tactics and require clearer disclosures and express consumer consent.

The Federal Trade Commission has announced that grocery delivery provider Instacart has agreed to pay $60 million in refunds to consumers as part of a settlement resolving allegations that the company engaged in widespread deceptive practices.

According to the FTC, those practices harmed shoppers and increased the overall cost of grocery delivery for Americans.

Under the proposed settlement, Instacart must also stop the misleading conduct identified by the agency. Consumers who were charged for Instacart+ memberships without their express, informed consent will be eligible for refunds.

“Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services, and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered, and failing to disclose to consumers who signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,” said Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. He added that the agency is closely monitoring online delivery services to ensure companies compete transparently on price and delivery terms.

As of now, the FTC has not yet provided detailed specifics about how affected consumers will receive their refunds in the Instacart settlement. The agency typically releases that information — including the refund distribution process and whether consumers need to file a claim — only after the court approves the final order and the refund program is established.

Not so free

The FTC alleges that Instacart falsely advertised “free delivery” on first orders, even though consumers were still required to pay mandatory service fees. Those fees, which can add up to 15% to the cost of an order, were not clearly disclosed to shoppers, according to the agency.

Regulators also took issue with Instacart’s claims of a “100% satisfaction guarantee.” The FTC says the language suggested consumers would receive full refunds if they were dissatisfied, but in practice, customers who experienced late deliveries or poor service were often offered only small credits for future orders rather than refunds. In addition, the FTC alleges that Instacart obscured refund options within its self-service menu, leading many consumers to believe credits were their only option.

Another major focus of the complaint was Instacart’s handling of its Instacart+ subscription program. The FTC alleges that the company failed to clearly disclose that consumers who signed up for a free trial would be automatically charged at the end of the trial period. The agency also says Instacart did not adequately explain its restrictive refund policies, resulting in hundreds of thousands of consumers being charged membership fees without receiving benefits or refunds.

As part of the proposed settlement order, Instacart would be prohibited from misrepresenting delivery costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company would also be required to clearly and conspicuously disclose subscription terms and obtain express informed consent before enrolling consumers in programs that involve automatic charges unless customers actively opt out.

The FTC approved the stipulated final order by a 2–0 vote and filed it in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. If approved and signed by a federal judge, the order will carry the force of law.",https://media.consumeraffairs.com/files/news/Instacart_GPT_CA-2025_o9ZD8jf.png,N,,2025-12-19 16:05:20.594042

The company also supplies sample-prep automation, QC instruments, and informatics solutions that help labs standardize long-read workflows, including those built around PacBio SMRT systems. With a broad footprint in clinical and translational labs, Thermo Fisher is well-positioned to support the move toward integrated DNA–RNA–protein analysis, in which SMRT sequencing provides high-fidelity, long-read genomes. At the same time, Thermo’s tools handle complementary assays and routine diagnostics.

Agilent Technologies, Inc. (US) contributes to the SMRT sequencing market primarily as an upstream and QC partner, offering high-precision LC, GC, electrophoresis, and Bioanalyzer/Fragment Analyzer platforms widely used for SMRT library quality control and sizing. Its target-enrichment kits, automation solutions, and analytical instruments help researchers optimize sample quality and focus on difficult genomic regions before running long-read SMRT experiments. By focusing on robust front-end prep, method development, and data validation, Agilent enables smoother adoption of SMRT workflows in research and clinical labs that require reliable, audit-ready results.

Apps are not simple plugins; they bring context and action into conversations, enabling tasks like creating playlists, ordering groceries or browsing real-estate listings without switching platforms.

This launch comes after a broader rollout of the ChatGPT Apps SDK earlier in 2025, which invited developers to build and test “chat-native” applications that respond to natural language and engage users within the conversational flow, extending ChatGPT’s role from answering queries to facilitating workflows, as reported by PYMNTS.

Developer Details

At the heart of the app store is the OpenAI Apps SDK, a developer toolkit that builds on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and allows external service providers to embed structured logic and interfaces into ChatGPT itself. Developers can now design applications that react contextually to user prompts, display interactive elements, and operate within a unified AI experience instead of siloed environments.

Verified developers can submit apps for review through the OpenAI Developer Platform. Submitted applications undergo a quality and safety review process; those that meet the guidelines can be published in the App Directory and become discoverable to the global ChatGPT user base.

OpenAI has also published detailed app submission guidelines, example apps and an open-sourced UI library to assist developers in building experiences that are intuitive within chat.

Apps can be triggered during conversations when users call them by name or select them through the tools interface. OpenAI is experimenting with ways to surface contextually relevant apps based on conversational signals like intent, usage patterns and user preferences.

While developers can currently link out from apps to complete transactions on external sites or native mobile applications, OpenAI is exploring new monetization methods over time, including the sale of digital goods and in-app commerce features, though specifics remain under development.

User Experience and Strategic Implications

For users, the ChatGPT app store means access to specialized tools and services without downloading standalone software. Instead of switching between native mobile apps or browser tabs, users can perform tasks like listening to curated playlists, ordering food or planning travel, all within the same chat interface.

This “AI-centric” user experience reduces friction and reimagines digital task flow around conversational intent. According to PYMNTS Intelligence data, nearly one-third of surveyed consumers say they would allow an AI agent to help with everyday planning and organization.

Early apps in the directory include integrations from Spotify, DoorDash, Zillow and Apple Music.",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/OpenAI-artificial-intelligence-ChatGPT.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 11:02:18.726361

As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder.","Zara is now using AI to digitally alter model images, showcasing new outfits without costly reshoots. This move, mirrored by H&M and Zalando, aims for faster visual production. While brands assure AI complements human roles and respects model consent and pay, concerns linger about potential job displacement for creatives.

Zara has quietly joined the growing list of fashion brands experimenting with artificial intelligence, and it’s already stirring conversation. The fast-fashion giant is now using AI to tweak images of real models, showing them in different outfits without having to reshoot everything again and again. The goal is pretty straightforward: faster visuals, fewer shoots, and quicker rollouts. But it also signals a bigger change in how fashion imagery is being made. Zara isn’t alone in this. Earlier this year, H&M revealed it had created AI-generated versions of models for its marketing work, and Zalando has been using similar tools to speed up campaign production. Together, these moves show how fashion brands are turning to tech to keep up with the industry’s relentless pace. Zara’s parent company, Inditex, has been quick to clarify that AI isn’t here to replace humans. “We are using artificial intelligence only to complement our existing processes,” a company spokesperson said. They added that models are kept in the loop, their consent is taken before any AI edits are made, and payments follow industry standards. The details first came out through a report by London-based outlet CityAM. According to the report, a model said Zara asked for approval before using AI to digitally show them wearing different outfits. The model also shared that they were paid the same amount they would have earned if they had travelled for another shoot, which suggests brands are trying to tread carefully, at least for now. H&M and Zalando have made similar statements, saying AI is meant to support creative teams, not replace them. Photographers, stylists, makeup artists, and production crews are still part of the process, even if technology helps brands work faster and cut costs behind the scenes. What makes Zara’s move especially interesting is that Inditex chair Marta Ortega is known to be a big supporter of fashion photography. The daughter of Zara founder Amancio Ortega has often spoken about her love for the art form. Since 2021, her MOP Foundation gallery in A Coruña, the Spanish city where Zara began, has hosted exhibitions celebrating legendary photographers. Right now, the gallery is showing Annie Leibovitz’s work, and previous exhibitions have highlighted names like Steven Meisel, a long-time Zara collaborator, and Helmut Newton. At the same time, Ortega has been pushing Zara towards a more premium feel, shutting down smaller stores and focusing on larger, more polished flagship spaces. Still, not everyone is convinced this AI shift is harmless. Isabelle Doran, CEO of the Association of Photographers in London, has warned that wider use of AI could reduce how often photographers, models, and production teams are hired. Her concern is that this won’t just affect big names in the industry, but also young creatives trying to get their first break. As more fashion brands bring AI into their creative process, the conversation around creativity, fair pay, and the future of fashion imagery is only getting louder. And for now, the industry is still figuring out where exactly the line should be drawn.

The French beauty giant’s final 25.8% stake in the professional hair care brand has been divested to KKR’s managed capital accounts and investment affiliates.

Under the terms of the transaction, Coty will receive an upfront cash consideration of US$750m.

This also includes 45% of any proceeds from a further sale or an initial public offering (IPO) of the business, after KKR’s preferred return has been met.

Coty stated it sees “strong potential” for additional cash proceeds, based on Wella’s “strong recent and expected performance”, as well as current market valuations.

The stake divestment rounds off Coty’s optimisation programme, initiated in 2020 to simplify its portfolio and operations, while also realising the full value of its Wella business.

“This transaction marks a pivotal milestone for Coty – both in our transformation and in our long running deleveraging commitment,” said Laurent Mercier, Coty’s CFO.

“Our strategic partnership with KKR has proven highly value accretive.

“We have benefited from Wella’s strong growth by progressively monetising our stake, allowing us to strengthen Coty’s financial foundations year after year.”

Coty intends to use the majority of the Wella upfront cash proceeds related to this transaction to pay down its short-term and long-term debt.

American multinational investment bank Citi is serving as financial advisor to Coty.

Mercier added: “Completing this transaction exactly in line with our original target to fully divest Wella by the end of CY25 underscores our focus on delivering on our financial commitments and crystallising value from non-core assets, all while sharpening our strategic focus.”

OpenAI entered ""code red"" earlier this month, about two weeks after Google released its latest AI chatbot, Gemini 3.
Since OpenAI entered ""code red,"" the company has moved quickly to ship new upgrades and features.
The state of ""code red"" has also been a precedent for other tech companies.
In 2022, Google declared an internal ""code red"" after ChatGPT's debut.","""Code red"" isn't a one-off at OpenAI.

CEO Sam Altman said on an episode of the ""Big Technology Podcast"" published Thursday that the company has entered emergency mode multiple times in response to competitive threats — and expects to continue doing so as rivals close in.

""It's good to be paranoid and act quickly when a potential competitive threat emerges,"" Altman said.

""My guess is we'll be doing these once maybe twice a year for a long time, and that's part of really just making sure that we win in our space,"" he added.

Altman said that OpenAI had gone ""code red"" earlier this year when China's DeepSeek emerged. DeepSeek shocked the tech industry in January when it said its AI model matches top competitors like ChatGPT's o1 at a fraction of the cost.

OpenAI entered ""code red"" earlier this month, about two weeks after Google released its latest AI chatbot, Gemini 3. The model drew widespread praise after its release in November, with Google touting it as its most advanced model to date. Altman reportedly told staff in an internal Slack memo that OpenAI would prioritize ChatGPT while pushing back other product plans.

Altman said in the podcast episode that Google's Gemini 3 did not have ""the impact we were worried it might.""

""But it did — in the same way that Deepseek did — identify some weaknesses in our product offering strategy, and we're addressing those very quickly,"" he added.

Since OpenAI entered ""code red,"" the company has moved quickly to ship new upgrades and features.

Last week, it rolled out a more advanced AI model aimed at improving ChatGPT's performance across professional work, coding, and scientific tasks. OpenAI also unveiled a new image-generation model earlier this week.

Altman said the company will not be in code red ""that much longer.""

""Historically, these have been kind of like six- or eight-week things for us,"" he added.

The state of ""code red"" has also been a precedent for other tech companies. In 2022, Google declared an internal ""code red"" after ChatGPT's debut.

The view that emerging markets are high-risk destinations for investment has long shaped the global marketplace, keeping a disproportionate share of capital in wealthier countries.

This mismatch is increasingly untenable. Where public and private investment is scarce, jobs will not flourish — with profound implications for prosperity and security, as hundreds of millions of young workers enter the labour force over the next decade across developing countries.

Greater clarity around emerging market risks is needed not simply to change well-worn beliefs but to have a tangible impact on where capital is deployed.

There are some positive signs. Recently announced changes to the S&P Global Ratings methodology for rating multilateral lending institutions and other supranational institutions — those owned or established by the governments of two or more countries — are one of the latest signs of that trend.

The rating agency recently reviewed how it evaluates international development institutions — like the World Bank and the European Investment Bank — that lend to governments. After five months of consultations with stakeholders, it updated its methodology, resulting in improved credit ratings for these institutions. The changes specifically adjusted how S&P weighs the risks when these multilateral lenders provide loans to sovereign governments.

According to the agency, the revised methodology could unlock between $600bn and $800bn in sovereign lending by multilateral development banks to emerging markets and developing economies. This would support better infrastructure, more food security, reliable electricity and job creation at a time when it is needed most.

This decision is underpinned by data from GEMs: the Global Emerging Markets Risk Database. Developed by the World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation, it is the largest credit risk database of its kind.

By pooling credit risk data from multilateral development banks, GEMs offers unprecedented transparency on emerging market credit risks. In doing so, it is separating fact from perception and demonstrating that emerging markets are not nearly as risky as previously thought, especially when investing alongside MDBs.

The most recent GEMs statistics, published in October 2025, highlight that direct lending by MDBs to 167 sovereign emerging market and developing economies have shown strong loan performance over the past four decades.

Between 1984 and 2024, the annual default rate averaged less than 1 per cent, significantly lower than that observed by international credit rating agencies for sovereign lending from non-MDB lenders. And on the flipside, recovery rates on loans to sovereign and sovereign-guaranteed entities averaged more than 95 per cent. The data from GEMs is also compelling when looking at MDB lending for private and public sector entities in emerging markets.

These statistics speak for themselves. The data demonstrates that evidence-based investing in emerging markets and developing economies, particularly alongside MDBs, could be win-win for everyone. And the change to S&P’s rating methodology shows the support for, and confidence in, the multilateral institutions’ ability to scale public and private finance investments in emerging markets.

Most importantly, it sets the stage for a broader shift in investment strategies that allows other key rating agencies and investors to take evidence-based reviews of their risk methodologies in favour of increased lending and potential new capital where it is needed most.",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/19997689-1cb0-4d1b-90b1-61276bca4f80.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 08:01:51.484050

Booking Holdings, Expedia and Airbnb are accused of allowing money to be made from bookings on seized Palestinian land.
Result of unbiased, ongoing review - ASB ASB said it had spent ""significant time"" completing a review of Motorola Solutions.
""We are now specifying Motorola Solutions as an excluded investment from the funds.","ASB has dropped Motorola Solutions from its investment funds, including KiwiSaver, after pressure from pro-Palestine groups.

Motorola provides telecommunications, surveillance and military technology to the Israeli military and illegal Israeli settlements.

But ethical investment platform Mindful Money says the big banks are still investing in companies that are exposed to human rights violations in Palestine.

Founder Barry Coates said it was welcome that ASB had divested from Motorola.

""At last ASB has agreed to sell their investments in Motorola Solutions, over two years after the information was disclosed on Mindful Money's website and after campaigning by Justice for Palestine, Amnesty International Aotearoa and others.

""This is welcome news.

""However, each of the big four bank-branded KiwiSaver funds still invest in companies that contribute to violations of human rights in Palestine, despite Kiwis saying they want to avoid those investments. The banks are not listening to the thousands of Kiwis who have invested in their funds.""

He said, before the divestment, ASB had 0.87 percent of its KiwiSaver growth fund in companies Mindful Money identified as problematic in the conflict with Israel including IBM, Palantir, Motorola, Booking Holdings, Airbnb and Cemex.

ANZ had 0.54 percent of its growth fund in Booking Holdings, Airbnb, Motorola, Volvo and IBM.

BNZ had 0.79 percent in Palantir, IBM, Booking Holdings, Glencore, Airbnb, Rheinmetall AG, Holcim, Volvo, Expedia, Heildelberge Materials, Cemex and Maersk.

Westpac had 0.57 percent in Booking Holdings, Caterpillar, Palantir Technologies, IBM, Holcim, and Heidelberg Materials.

Booking Holdings, Expedia and Airbnb are accused of allowing money to be made from bookings on seized Palestinian land.

""The ongoing crises in Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem are affecting the lives of millions of Palestinian people. Our KiwiSaver funds should not be invested in companies that are supporting violations of their rights,"" Coates said.

Result of unbiased, ongoing review - ASB

ASB said it had spent ""significant time"" completing a review of Motorola Solutions.

""Previously, we have been able to meet with Motorola and they had engaged openly with us to answer any questions we've had,"" it said in a statement.

""In October this year, as part of our latest review, we reached out to Motorola again to discuss their inclusion on the updated UN OHCHR database, and request that they meet with us to provide an update.

""Motorola has failed to respond to this request, despite multiple follow ups. This lack of engagement and our inability to receive an update is a concern to us and one of the factors underpinning our decision to divest.

""We are now specifying Motorola Solutions as an excluded investment from the funds. This decision is the result of our unbiased and ongoing review as part of our own due diligence, and not a result of external pressure from any group or organisation, which is not new with regards to this issue.

""We condemn all violence, and as we have said previously, our position on this particular holding doesn't represent support, or otherwise, for any group or people, of any identity.""

Westpac, ANZ and BNZ have been approached for comment.

'Huge win'

""ASB's divestment from Motorola is a huge win for the fight in Aotearoa New Zealand for Palestinians to have equal human rights in their homeland,"" Justice for Palestine spokesperson Kate Stone said.

""Israel is only able to maintain its apartheid regime of systemic discrimination against Palestinians and expand its illegal settlements because of the material support of the international community. This includes investments of financial institutions like ASB and other New Zealand banks and KiwiSaver fund managers.

""Over 8500 people signed the petition calling on ASB to divest, and hundreds of customers moved their KiwiSavers, mortgages and banking services away from ASB because they support Palestinians having the same rights to freedom, justice and equality as the rest of humanity,"" Stone said.",https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--RhMzSKeW--/t_tohu-badge-facebook/v1668055945/4LIJ0NT_ASB_2_jpg?_a=BACCd2AD,N,,2025-12-19 04:03:09.205735

The stock's change was more than the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.79%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.14%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.38%.

Shares of the upscale clothing company witnessed a gain of 10.53% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Consumer Discretionary sector with its gain of 2.39%, and the S&P 500's gain of 0.87%.

Market participants will be closely following the financial results of Ralph Lauren in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $5.75, showcasing a 19.29% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $2.3 billion, indicating a 7.27% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.

For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $15.41 per share and revenue of $7.75 billion, which would represent changes of +24.98% and +9.54%, respectively, from the prior year.

Investors should also take note of any recent adjustments to analyst estimates for Ralph Lauren. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the business and profitability.

Empirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.

Investors should also note Ralph Lauren's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 23.74. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry average Forward P/E of 17.93.

Also, we should mention that RL has a PEG ratio of 1.77.

Ideally, by the time the press gets their hands on a new product or service, all the kinks have already been worked out.

Not so for “Claudius,” an AI-operated vending machine that Anthropic lent to The Wall Street Journal for testing in November.

The end results were hilariously disastrous. Claudius was supposed to order inventory, set prices and respond to customer requests. Instead it bought a Playstation 5 and a live betta fish, gave away items in what it referred to as an “Ultra-Capitalist Free-For-All” and spent more than twice its allotted budget.

Anthropic, for its part, considers the experiment a success, or so its reps told the Journal. These kinds of stress tests, after all, give them insight into what needs fixing.

But the question remains: Why test it with journalists, of all people?

Sure, highlighting the WSJ’s red team efforts would’ve been fun a few years ago, back when the internet was still giggling over DALL-E memes. But now that so many companies are actively trying to capitalize on this technology – and encountering similar, albeit less absurd performance issues – all publicity might not be good publicity anymore.

Put more simply, if AI agents can’t reliably buy snacks yet, then what hope do marketers have in making them work right now?

Ads vs. AIs

Personalized advertising allows tons of content to be free and accessible while enriching companies up and down the supply chain. The downside is that everybody hates it.

For example, Meta is correct to keep its focus relentlessly on improvements to its digital advertising flywheel, writes Eric Seufert at Mobile Dev Memo. His hot take is in response to a New York Times story about tensions between Meta’s AI lab team and Facebook-era leaders.

The flip side of the coin is OpenAI, which, as The Information reports, has an awkward “ChatGPT problem.” Its cutting-edge AI research team is frustrated, too, because new stakeholders within OpenAI are pushing for more monetization. The latest updates to OpenAI’s core models prioritize capability gains over monetization metrics like user retention and subscriptions.

Seufert writes that this imbalance favors Meta and Google. Their large ad businesses grow as the companies add users and improve the proficiency of their ad systems. OpenAI’s API revenues go up when its models improve – but not nearly enough to meet its revenue projections.

That shortfall must be made up by advertising revenue at some point.

All Fun And Games

Will in-game advertising ever really happen? The idea remains tantalizing yet illusive.

No online platform has a better shot at it, though, than Roblox, as Digiday reports.

The rationale for in-game ads is pretty straightforward. Engagement is through the roof. Roblox has 151 million daily active users who spend close to three hours per day on average in the app.

And Roblox wouldn’t have to saturate players with ads to see a healthy return. Snapchat’s average revenue per user, for instance, is in the $12 to $15 per year range. Less than half of that would mean an instant multibillion-dollar business line for Roblox.

On the other hand, Roblox’s user base is young – like tweens and younger. This complicates the picture, because there are extra rules governing how data can be used for targeting, which shrinks the pool of possible advertisers.

So while the potential is massive, Roblox’s path to ad billions still feels more like a pipe dream than a pay day.

Lululemon's approach didn't sit well with its founder, Dennis “Chip” Wilson, who saw it as a sign of insufficient planning.","Lululemon needs a new CEO. One investor's preferred candidate might not be a a stretch.

Less than a week has passed since Lululemon announced it was seeking a CEO, and one of its biggest stakeholders is already floating a candidate who—based on the market's reaction—seems to appeal to fellow investors: Jane Nielsen, who contributed to turnarounds at Ralph Lauren (RL) and Coach, now part of Tapestry (TPR).

Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has put forward Nielsen, the notion which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Elliott has acquired a more than $1 billion stake in the retailer, according to a person familiar with the matter, giving it sway in a company with a market value of about $25 billion.

Lululemon Athletica (LULU) didn't respond to a request for comment in time for publication. But investors appear to be considering the involvement of Elliott—and its pick of Nielsen, previously CFO at Ralph Lauren and now a board member at Mondelēz International (MDLZ)—warmly: Company shares were recently up more than 4%. (They remain down more than 40% this year, part of why a new chief is needed in the first place.)

“Lululemon is one of the most powerful brands in retail, defined by exceptional products, deeply engaged communities and significant global potential,” Nielsen told The Journal. “I would welcome the chance to discuss this opportunity with the Lululemon board.""

The Canada-based retailer last week said CEO Calvin McDonald will leave his post at the end of January, and that it was seeking a successor with growth and restructuring experience. The move stood out in a time when a number of other well-known consumer-facing companies, such as Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT) and Nike (NIKE) have named successors without a public search.

Lululemon's approach didn't sit well with its founder, Dennis “Chip” Wilson, who saw it as a sign of insufficient planning. Wilson has a more than 8% stake in Lululemon. He also has a history of publicizing when he disagrees with the retailer, including voicing concern about Lululemon moving far beyond its yoga-focused roots. He didn't respond to Investopedia's request for comment in time for publication.

However, the increased demand during this festive time often leads to longer wait times at coffee shops and drive-thrus. Despite the delays, many customers feel that the indulgence is worth their time.

On a less festive note, the coffee industry has faced significant challenges throughout the year, particularly for major players like Starbucks and Peet’s. In September, Starbucks announced plans to close hundreds of stores as part of a restructuring effort expected to cost the company $1 billion. The coffee giant revealed it would reduce its North American store count by about 1%, decreasing from 18,734 to 18,300 locations by the end of fiscal year 2025. The decision came after a thorough review of its North American portfolio, targeting underperforming stores or those that cannot meet new design standards.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol emphasized the necessity of this decision, stating that some locations did not meet the physical standards expected by customers and employees, or lacked a clear path to financial viability. In addition to store closures, the company will invest in remodeling a thousand locations at a cost of $150,000 each by 2026.

Peet’s Coffee, which operates over 250 locations in the U.S., has also experienced closures, including recent shut-downs in several California cities. However, optimism surrounds Peet’s as its parent company, JDE Peet’s, is set to be acquired by Keurig Dr Pepper in an $18 billion deal expected to finalize in the first half of 2026.

In contrast, Compass Coffee is facing dire circumstances, having recently closed its Washington, D.C. roastery amid financial distress. The coffee company has indicated potential plans to file for bankruptcy protection by the end of the year. Following a court ruling, Compass Coffee has been mandated to pay approximately $744,000 in back rent to its landlord and has not been able to cover rent since January 2025. If the company cannot negotiate a rent reduction, it may have to vacate its premises altogether.

Despite these challenges, Compass Coffee continues to operate 25 locations across Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland, although the current financial situation casts uncertainty over its future.

He served in the U.S. Army from 1964 to 1967, stationed overseas and reaching the rank of E-6. In Kankakee, Thomas was a longtime member and supporter of St. Patrick Church, and owner-operator of AC Forms Inc. for 35 years.

Thomas is survived by his loving wife of 56 years, Patricia (Newman) Johnson. They were married in May 1969 and built a life filled with love and laughs.

His legacy lives on through his children and their partners: Kimberly Zaccone and her partner Tom Castro, Danette Johnson and her husband Mark Switzer, Darren Johnson, Jeffery and his wife Erica (Simmons) Johnson, Samantha and her husband Kyle Johnson. The sparkle in his eyes was always brightest when he was with his grandchildren: Alyssa, Nick, Brooke, and Max Zaccone; Kylie, Jax, and Lilliann Johnson; and his great-grandchildren, Paxton and Alexander Zaccone.

Thomas devoted his life to providing for his family, offering steady support, strength, love, and humor. While his family grieves his loss, they take comfort in knowing he is at peace and that his spirit will live on in the countless memories they shared. He will be deeply missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing him.

A service will be held at St. Patrick Church, 428 S. Indiana Ave., Kankakee, at 11 a.m. on Saturday, December 20th. A visitation will follow at Jensen Funeral Home, 3639 E.

As kids go, Monica Santamaria was always on the move.

“She absolutely loved swimming, volleyball, decorating and painting,” said her father, Roberto. “Her passion was contagious. She wore us out in a good way. We never saw any hints of physical problems. She was perfectly healthy.”

That all changed when Monica turned 6.

Her parents noticed her body curved to the left when she walked, and a similar curve began forming in her back. Doctors in Monica’s hometown of Managua, Nicaragua did a variety of tests and eventually diagnosed her with scoliosis, a severe and painful curvature of the spine that sometimes afflicts children, generally girls, during growth spurts.

“We had never heard of scoliosis and so the news was devastating,” Roberto remembers. “The more we learned, the more frightened we became.”

Monica experienced many symptoms: back pain, pain in her lower limbs, cramps, fatigue, headaches, and trouble sleeping. Suddenly the girl with so much energy and love for sports couldn’t participate in gym class or play games that might hurt her back.

“I felt sad because I had so much fun doing those things but then I couldn’t,” Monica said. “Sometimes I had to play by myself because the teachers didn’t want my classmates to hurt me accidentally.”

From desperation to hope

Scoliosis can often be treated through spine surgery, but such care is not available in Nicaragua. The Santamarias learned through their spine specialist about the medical missions of SpineHope, a U.S. based nonprofit that brings together surgeons, donated medical and surgical equipment, and teams of volunteers to take scoliosis treatment to various countries, including Nicaragua.

“It’s the most altruistic thing I’ve ever seen,” said Toby Hernandez, a sales rep in the Medtronic Cranial and Spinal Technologies Operating Unit who volunteers with SpineHope. “These children, these families, have no other options. They’re desperate. When they learn their child is going to get help, it’s a very emotional moment. Everybody in the room is crying, including us.”

The volunteer teams typically take two to four mission trips every year. Three missions are planned for 2025. Each trip involves prepping, packing, shipping and setting up an entire, functioning operating room in another country — roughly 30 bins of precision medical equipment and spine implants.

“It’s hard work, but it’s life-changing work and it’s all for these families and these children,” said Whitney Scurlock-Wood, a Medtronic spinal sales representative who has volunteered with SpineHope for the last four years. “Seeing the difference we make in people’s lives is just amazing. I take away something from every mission trip I go on.”

The team often performs several procedures on each mission. Occasionally, SpineHope’s case assessment concludes the patient should be brought to the U.S. for surgery, and that’s what happened with Monica.

“It didn’t hurt anymore”

For a month before surgery, Monica wore a halo-gravity traction device, which is a way of gently stretching the spine before surgery. Doctors attached a metal ring to Monica’s head and slowly added weights to a pulley system to apply traction to her spine. Eventually the system weighed 35 pounds, almost half of Monica’s body weight. But the process reduced her spine curvature by almost 50 percent, from 127 degrees to 73 degrees, and prepared her for the surgery.

Then, volunteer surgeons used donated Medtronic spine products in the procedure to straighten her curved spine.

Several Medtronic volunteers participated in the eight-hour operation.

Monica’s recovery started almost immediately. “The medical assistants helped her stand up the day after surgery and she took her first steps,” Roberto said. “It was incredible. Amazing.”

Seven days later, Monica left the hospital, no longer in pain and walking on her own. “It didn’t hurt anymore and I could do the things I liked to do again,” she said.

Today, Monica is back to swimming, playing volleyball, skating, and painting — activities she always loved but had to limit due to her condition. Her mood changed drastically; her smile is back and she’s happily looking forward to a life full of new possibilities.

“I’m grateful to everyone on my care team for everything they’ve done for me,” Monica said. “They gave me my life back.”

Medtronic has partnered with SpineHope ever since its formation in 2008—helping change the lives of more than 200 young patients.

“Medtronic is so committed to doing the right thing for the right people, Hernandez said. “It’s amazing and inspiring to be a part of it.”

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates, and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes may be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is a result of several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-15 of this pricing supplement.

SELECTED PURCHASE CONSIDERATIONS

The Notes are not appropriate for all investors. The Notes may be an appropriate investment for you if all of the following statements are true:

●You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and you can tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

●You understand and accept that you will not participate in any appreciation of the Reference Asset, which may be significant, and that your return potential on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons and Unpaid Coupon Amounts, if any, paid on the Notes.

●You can tolerate a loss of a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes, and you are willing and able to make an investment that may have the full downside market risk of an investment in the Reference Asset.

●You are willing and able to accept the risks associated with receiving shares of the Reference Asset at maturity.

●You do not anticipate that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Coupon Barrier Value on any Observation Date or below the Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date.

●You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure.

●You understand and accept the risks that (a) you will not receive a Contingent Coupon if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date and (b) you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity if the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value.

●You understand and accept the risk that you will not receive any Unpaid Coupon Amounts unless a Contingent Coupon becomes payable on a subsequent Observation Date.

●You understand and accept the risk that, if the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, the payment at maturity, if any, will be based solely on the Reference Asset Return of the Reference Asset.

●You understand and are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Asset.

●You are willing and able to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield.

●You can tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes prior to scheduled maturity that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Reference Asset.

●You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and you are willing and able to hold the Notes to maturity if the Notes are not redeemed.

●You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

●You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

The Notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if any of the following statements are true:

●You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income, and/or you cannot tolerate receiving few or no Contingent Coupons over the term of the Notes in the event the Closing Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more of the specified Observation Dates.

●You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of the Reference Asset rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Contingent Coupons and Unpaid Coupon Amounts, if any, paid on the Notes.

●You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose some or all of the principal amount of the Notes in the event that the Final Value of the Reference Asset falls below the Barrier Value.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with receiving shares of the Reference Asset at maturity.

●You anticipate that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will decline during the term of the Notes such that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Coupon Barrier Value on one or more Observation Dates and/or the Final Value of the Reference Asset will fall below the Barrier Value.

●You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Reference Asset.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of the Reference Asset may cause you to not receive Contingent Coupons (and thus, Unpaid Coupon Amounts) and/or suffer a loss of principal at maturity.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the Notes may be redeemed prior to scheduled maturity.

●You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE UPON AUTOMATIC CALL

The following examples demonstrate the hypothetical total return upon an Automatic Call under various circumstances. The “total return” as used in these examples is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the aggregate payments per $1,000 principal amount Note to $1,000. The hypothetical total returns set forth below are for illustrative purposes only and may not be the actual total returns applicable to a purchaser of the Notes. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumption:

■For each Observation Date that is not also a Call Valuation Date, the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value. Accordingly, you will NOT receive Contingent Coupons on those Observation Dates, unless indicated otherwise below.

Example 1: The Notes are redeemed on the first Call Valuation Date.

Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the first Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date.

The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes.

The total return on investment of the Notes is 5.375%.

Example 2: The Notes are redeemed on the third Call Valuation Date.

** Any Unpaid Coupon Amount has been paid on a previous Contingent Coupon Payment Date.

Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the third Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date.

The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes.

The total return on investment of the Notes is 10.75%.

Example 3: The Notes are redeemed on the final Call Valuation Date.

** Assumes NO Contingent Coupons have been previously paid. Accordingly, this amount includes the Contingent Coupon that is payable on this Contingent Coupon Payment Date plus the Unpaid Coupon Amounts that have accrued.

Because the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the final Call Valuation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Value, the Notes are redeemed and you will receive the Redemption Price on the related Call Settlement Date. Example 3 demonstrates that the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date prior to the final Call Valuation Date. Accordingly, no Contingent Coupons are payable on the Notes until the final Call Valuation Date.

The Notes will cease to be outstanding after the Call Settlement Date, and you will not receive any further payments on the Notes.

The total return on investment of the Notes is 18.8125%.

Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on the Notes upon an Automatic Call will be limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable on the Notes up to and including the applicable Call Settlement Date.

Each of the examples above demonstrate that the return on your Notes will be limited to the Contingent Coupons and any Unpaid Coupon Amounts that may be payable on the Notes. Each of these examples also demonstrate that, if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on an Observation Date, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date. If a Contingent Coupon does not become payable with respect to an Observation Date (and instead becomes an Unpaid Coupon Amount), you will receive payment of such amount only if a Contingent Coupon becomes payable with respect to a future Observation Date. If a Contingent Coupon fails to become payable with respect to an Observation Date, and if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each subsequent Observation Date, you will never receive payment of the Unpaid Coupon Amount(s). If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any coupon payments during the term of the Notes.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES OF AMOUNTS PAYABLE AT MATURITY

The following table illustrates the hypothetical payment at maturity under various circumstances. The examples set forth below are purely hypothetical and are provided for illustrative purposes only. The numbers appearing in the following tables and examples have been rounded for ease of analysis. The hypothetical examples below do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the Notes and make the following key assumptions:

■You hold the Notes to maturity, and the Notes are NOT redeemed prior to scheduled maturity.

** per $1,000 principal amount Note, excluding the final Contingent Coupon that may be payable on the Maturity Date, and assumes we do not elect to exercise our physical settlement option. For an example demonstrating the amount of shares and cash that you would receive if (a) the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value and (b) we elect to exercise our physical settlement option, please see the final example below.

The following examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated:

Example 1: The Final Value of the Reference Asset is $210.00.

Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus (i) the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date and (ii) any Unpaid Coupon Amounts that have not previously been paid).

Example 2: The Final Value of the Reference Asset is $90.00.

Because the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold (plus (i) the Contingent Coupon that will otherwise be payable on the Maturity Date and (ii) any Unpaid Coupon Amounts that have not previously been paid).

SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Asset or its components, if any. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

●Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss — The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Notes are not redeemed prior to scheduled maturity, and if the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Reference Asset from the Initial Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

●The Notes Are Subject to Risks Associated with our Physical Settlement Option — As described on the cover of this pricing supplement, you may under certain circumstances receive shares of the Reference Asset at maturity. If we exercise our physical settlement option, the market value of the shares that you receive may be less than the amount of the cash payment that you would have received had we not exercised such option because of fluctuations in the value of the Reference Asset between the Final Valuation Date and the Maturity Date.

●Potential Return is Limited to the Contingent Coupons, If Any, and You Will Not Participate in Any Appreciation of The Reference Asset — The potential positive return on the Notes is limited to the Contingent Coupons, if any, that may be payable during the term of the Notes (whether paid as Contingent Coupons on the Contingent Coupon Payment Date following an Observation Date or as Unpaid Coupon Amounts on a subsequent Contingent Coupon Payment Date). You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the Reference Asset, which may be significant, even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the Reference Asset if the Notes are not redeemed and the Final Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Barrier Value.

●You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupon Payments on the Notes — The Issuer will not necessarily make periodic coupon payments on the Notes. You will receive a Contingent Coupon on a Contingent Coupon Payment Date only if the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on the related Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Coupon Barrier Value. If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier Value, you will not receive a Contingent Coupon on the related Contingent Coupon Payment Date and you will only receive the related Unpaid Coupon Amount if a Contingent Coupon becomes payable on a future Observation Date. If a Contingent Coupon fails to become payable on an Observation Date (and instead becomes an Unpaid Coupon Amount), and no Contingent Coupon becomes payable on any future Observation Date, you will never receive payment of the Unpaid Coupon Amount(s). If the Closing Value of the Reference Asset is less than the Coupon Barrier Value on each Observation Date, you will not receive any Contingent Coupons during the term of the Notes.

●The Notes Are Subject to Volatility Risk — Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of an asset (or level of an index) over a period of time. The amount of any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes is based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the Reference Asset. The amount of such coupon payments will be paid at a per annum rate that is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would have been had the expected volatility of the Reference Asset been lower. As volatility of the Reference Asset increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the Closing Value of the Reference Asset on one or more Observation Dates will be less than the Coupon Barrier Value and (b) the Final Value of the Reference Asset will be less than the Barrier Value.

Accordingly, you should understand that a higher coupon payment amount reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive coupon payments with respect to one or more Observation Dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the amount of such coupon payments been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the Notes may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the Notes were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive coupon payments and/or that you will lose some or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above.

●Early Redemption and Reinvestment Risk — While the original term of the Notes is as indicated on the cover of this pricing supplement, the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity, as described above, and the holding period over which you may receive any coupon payments that may be payable under the Notes could be as short as approximately six months.

The Redemption Price that you would receive on a Call Settlement Date, together with any coupon payments that you may have received prior to the Call Settlement Date, may be less than the aggregate amount of payments that you would have received had the Notes not been redeemed. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the Notes in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the Notes are redeemed prior to the Maturity Date. No additional payments will be due after the relevant Call Settlement Date. The fact that the Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity may also adversely impact your ability to sell your Notes and the price at which they may be sold.

●Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Reference Asset on the Dates Specified — Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Reference Asset on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Reference Asset determined at any other time.

●Contingent Repayment of Any Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity or upon Any Redemption — You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity or any redemption. Although the Notes provide for the contingent repayment of the principal amount of your Notes at maturity, provided that the Final Value of the Reference Asset is greater than or equal to the Barrier Value, or upon any redemption, if you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of the Reference Asset has increased from the Initial Value. See “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

●Owning the Notes is Not the Same as Owning a Reference Asset or Any Securities to which a Reference Asset Provides Exposure — The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights that holders of a Reference Asset or any securities to which a Reference Asset provides exposure may have.

●Tax Treatment — Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Tax Considerations” below.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

●Credit of Issuer — The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

●You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority — Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Reference Asset

●Historical Performance of the Reference Asset Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Reference Asset Over the Term of the Notes — The value of the Reference Asset has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of the Reference Asset is not an indication of the future performance of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of the Reference Asset.

●We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs — Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or a Reference Asset or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●Single Equity Risk — The value of the Reference Asset can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the Reference Asset, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the Reference Asset. We have not undertaken any independent review or due diligence of the SEC filings of the Reference Asset or of any other publicly available information regarding the Reference Asset.

●Anti-Dilution Protection Is Limited, and the Calculation Agent Has Discretion to Make Anti-Dilution Adjustments — The Calculation Agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the Notes upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the Calculation Agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the Reference Asset. However, the Calculation Agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect the Reference Asset. The occurrence of any such event and any adjustment made by the Calculation Agent (or a determination by the Calculation Agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect any amounts payable on the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●Reorganization Or Other Events Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes Or Result in the Notes Being Accelerated — Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of the Reference Asset, the Calculation Agent may replace the Reference Asset with shares of another company identified as described in the prospectus supplement or, in some cases, with shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of the Reference Asset upon the occurrence of that event. In the alternative, the Calculation Agent may accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent or may make other changes to the terms of the Notes to account for the occurrence of that event. Any decision by the Calculation Agent to replace the Reference Asset, to accelerate the Notes or to otherwise adjust the terms of the Notes could adversely affect the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes, perhaps significantly, and could result in a significantly lower return on the Notes than if the Calculation Agent had made a different decision. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

●We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Reference Asset or its components, if any. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Reference Asset and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, the Calculation Agent may be required to make discretionary judgements relating to the Reference Asset, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and this pricing supplement. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes is Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees (including any structuring or other distribution related fees) to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might be Lower if Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

●The Estimated Value of the Notes is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to be Inaccurate and May be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions — The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes — The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

●The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy The Notes in the Secondary Market And the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements At All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes — Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

●Lack of Liquidity — The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your Notes to maturity.

●Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes — The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe market price of, dividend rate on and expected volatility of the Reference Asset or the components of the Reference Asset, if any;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

INFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE ASSET

We urge you to read the following section in the accompanying prospectus supplement: “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Reference Asset Issuer and Reference Asset Information.” Companies with securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “Exchange Act,” and the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, which is commonly referred to as the “’40 Act,” are required to periodically file certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information provided to or filed with the SEC electronically can be accessed through a website maintained by the SEC. The address of the SEC’s website is http://www.sec.gov.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” This discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the ownership or disposition of the Reference Asset that you may receive at maturity. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential U.S. federal tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Reference Asset.

In determining our reporting responsibilities, if any, we intend to treat (i) the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with associated contingent coupons and (ii) any Contingent Coupon payments as ordinary income, as described in the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward or Derivative Contracts with Associated Coupons” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, has advised that it believes this treatment to be reasonable, but that there are other reasonable treatments that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may adopt.

Sale, exchange or redemption of a Note. Assuming the treatment described above is respected, and except as described below, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption for cash upon an automatic call or at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes (assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position referred to above). This gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss unless you hold the Notes for more than one year, in which case the gain or loss should be long-term capital gain or loss, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of the Notes at the issue price. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. If you sell your Notes between the time your right to a Contingent Coupon payment is fixed and the time it is paid, it is likely that you will be treated as receiving ordinary income equal to the Contingent Coupon payment. Although uncertain, it is possible that proceeds received from the sale or exchange of your Notes prior to an Observation Date but that can be attributed to an expected Contingent Coupon payment could be treated as ordinary income. You should consult your tax advisor regarding this issue.

If you receive shares of the Reference Asset upon the maturity of your Notes, you should be deemed to have applied the purchase price of your Notes toward the purchase of the shares of the Reference Asset you receive. You should not recognize gain or loss with respect to the shares of the Reference Asset you receive. Instead, assuming Contingent Coupon payments are properly treated as ordinary income, consistent with the position described above, your basis in the shares (including any fractional share) should equal the price you paid to acquire your Notes, and that basis should be allocated proportionately among the shares. Your holding period for the Reference Asset should begin on the day after receipt. With respect to any cash received in lieu of a fractional share of the Reference Asset, you should recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of the cash received and the tax basis allocable to the fractional share.

As noted above, there are other reasonable treatments that the IRS or a court may adopt, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments and the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Non-U.S. holders. Insofar as we have responsibility as a withholding agent, we do not currently intend to treat Contingent Coupon payments to non-U.S. holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) as subject to U.S. withholding tax. However, non-U.S. holders should in any event expect to be required to provide appropriate Forms W-8 or other documentation in order to establish an exemption from backup withholding, as described under the heading “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. If any withholding is required, we will not be required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts withheld.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, our special tax counsel is of the opinion that these regulations should not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.

SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

We have agreed to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “Agent”), and the Agent has agreed to purchase from us, the principal amount of the Notes, and at the price, specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The Agent commits to take and pay for all of the Notes, if any are taken.

VALIDITY OF THE NOTES

In the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, as special United States products counsel to Barclays Bank PLC, when the Notes offered by this pricing supplement have been issued by Barclays Bank PLC pursuant to the indenture, the trustee has made, in accordance with instructions from Barclays Bank PLC, appropriate entries or notations in its records relating to the master global note that represents such Notes (the “master note”), and such Notes have been delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such Notes will be valid and binding obligations of Barclays Bank PLC, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith) and possible judicial or regulatory actions or application giving effect to governmental actions or foreign laws affecting creditors’ rights, provided that such counsel expresses no opinion as to (i) the effect of fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar provision of applicable law on the conclusions expressed above or (ii) the validity, legally binding effect or enforceability of any provision that permits holders to collect any portion of the stated principal amount upon acceleration of the Notes to the extent determined to constitute unearned interest. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the laws of the State of New York. Insofar as this opinion involves matters governed by English law, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP has relied, with Barclays Bank PLC’s permission, on the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP, dated as of May 15, 2025, filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement on Form F-3ASR by Barclays Bank PLC on May 15, 2025, and this opinion is subject to the same assumptions, qualifications and limitations as set forth in such opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell London LLP. In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustee’s authorization, execution and delivery of the indenture and its authentication of the master note and the validity, binding nature and enforceability of the indenture with respect to the trustee, all as stated in the opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, dated May 15, 2025, which has been filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement referred to above.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2025-12-19 04:03:04.553089

As those closely following this field will know, in April 2025 HMT published a draft statutory instrument (SI), on which we wrote an earlier briefing highlighting key issues, as well as an unapologetically technical and detailed formal submission to HMT on the drafting. This article summarises how HMT has responded (or not) to our concerns, as well as touching on an important widening of the scope of the legislation to cover the introduction of a regime covering market abuse and admission to trading. The key point on the former topic is that HMT has, as it promised throughout its engagement with the sector, taken onboard the most fundamental critiques of the mistakes in the draft SI, but some issues remain. In addition, the FCA chose the following day to publish three consultation papers relevant to cryptoassets (merry Christmas!), which will be the subject of separate briefings.

The view suggests that leading PC manufacturers such as Lenovo, Dell, HP Inc, Apple, and Acer, with healthy inventory levels, advantages in procurement scale due to superior market share, and the ability to pass costs onto customers, are well-positioned to mitigate the effects of DRAM price increases in the second half of 2026.

With procurement volume and economies of scale, the five major PC manufacturers—Lenovo, HP Inc, Dell, Apple, and Acer—are expected to gain a slight increase in market share. Additionally, given their leadership positions in the server, smartphone, and enterprise storage markets, these companies are anticipated to enhance their purchasing power and secure priority access to memory supplies.

Other manufacturers, accounting for approximately 25% of the market share or around 65 to 70 million PCs, may face higher premiums for memory procurement, making it difficult to implement competitive pricing strategies. This presents an opportunity for leading vendors to further expand their market share in the mid-to-low price segments.

The report forecasts that AI-powered PCs are expected to account for 54% of total shipments in 2026, up from 34% in 2025; among these, AI PCs with computational power below 40 TOPS will represent 32% of total shipments and 62% of AI PC demand.

Beyond AI, the Windows 11 upgrade is expected to remain a key catalyst for shipments by Dell, Lenovo, and HP Inc in 2026. The current progress of the Windows 11 upgrade has lagged behind previous cycles. At present, approximately 35%-40% of Windows PCs still operate on older operating systems. This upgrade should help support shipments amid rising PC prices, particularly benefiting these three companies that hold leading positions in the commercial PC sector.

Over the past 12 months, Dell, Lenovo, and HP Inc collectively accounted for 75% of global commercial PC shipments. Despite strong brand loyalty among commercial customers and lower elasticity of demand in this segment compared to the consumer market, PC manufacturers will continue to optimize configurations to sustain demand and maximize sales.",https://pubimg.futunn.com/2022050900000233719bee4b9bc.jpg,N,,2025-12-19 03:00:46.269166

“We are deeply alarmed by reports that Instacart is using AI to hike prices on unsuspecting customers based on their shopping habits. People shouldn’t be charged higher prices than their neighbors for the same milk or eggs because their grocery app is profiling them. This is personalized price gouging, plain and simple.

“While hardworking Americans struggle to afford groceries, corporations like Instacart are inventing new ways to rip them off. Surveillance pricing is a blatant abuse of power by big tech — automating greed and making consumers pay the price.

“Enough is enough. With Instacart processing hundreds of millions of orders yearly, these practices warrant urgent action. The FTC and state regulators must immediately investigate Instacart and hold it accountable for ripping off its customers. And we need to ban personalized price gouging to ensure that everyone pays a fair price.”

Background

Instacart’s pricing tactics are detailed in a new report from Groundwork Collaborative and Consumer Reports, “Same Cart, Different Price.” The report describes how Instacart uses AI-driven “price experiments” to maximize margins by charging different customers different prices for identical items at the same store. According to the report, Instacart deploys software from its subsidiary Eversight to identify the highest price an individual is willing to pay.

Ralph Lauren Investment Narrative Recap

To own Ralph Lauren, you need to believe in its ability to pair a resilient premium brand with disciplined execution, even as macro and pricing risks linger. The latest dividend declaration reinforces the appeal for income-focused holders, but does not materially change the near term balance between strong earnings momentum as a key catalyst and demand sensitivity to higher prices as a central risk.

Among recent developments, the stronger than expected Q2 2026 results stand out in the context of this dividend news, with revenue up 17% and adjusted EPS rising 49% year over year. Management’s upgraded full year outlook for 5% to 7% constant currency revenue growth and operating margin expansion frames the dividend as one part of a broader capital return story supported by current operating performance.

Yet despite this strength, investors should also be aware of how rising tariffs and consumer price sensitivity could...

Please let us know if you have feedback.

Johnson Matthey has opened its first hydrogen internal combustion engine (H₂ICE) facility in what appears to be a healthy bet ahead of the European Union’s delay of zero-tailpipe vehicle sales previously slated for 2035.

A Dec. 16 statement published by Europe’s trade body, the European Commission, said lawmakers have agreed to allow “plug-in hybrids (PHEV), range extenders, mild hybrids, and internal combustion engine vehicles to still play a role beyond 2035.”

The move is the culmination of growing warnings by both automotive industry leaders and politicians, such as German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, that an ICE ban could decimate Europe’s legacy brands.

So, Johnson Matthey’s Dec. 11 announcement that it has opened a new center of H₂ICE excellence in Gothenburg, Sweden, to strengthen its world-class heavy-duty vehicle testing capabilities places the company ahead of the curve.

Interest in burning hydrogen in traditional engines has increased this year, with companies including South Korean automaker KGM and Mahle Powertrain seeing the technology as a fast way to expand hydrogen infrastructure ahead of the rollout of hydrogen fuel-cell powertrains.

Johnson Matthey said in its release that the tried-and-tested engine technology, presents “a viable path for decarbonizing medium and heavy-duty transport, such as trucks and buses.”

The center has been completed on time and on budget, representing a £2.5 million ($3.35 million) investment over three years.

The facility, already a test site for medium and heavy-duty diesel engines, supports H₂ICE engines up to 600 kW (800 hp).

It will now test the performance of catalysts within the wider engine after-treatment and control systems, providing key insights into the development of hydrogen mobility solutions, said the company.

“For more than two centuries, JM has helped tackle some of the world’s biggest challenges,” said Tauseef Salma, Johnson Matthey’s chief technology officer for clean air, in a statement. “We continue to do so today because it’s in our DNA,” she added.
