ASML stands out as the fastest-growing employer, with more than 21,000 full-time jobs in the Netherlands, up more than 76 percent in five years.","Defense has become by far the largest employer in the Netherlands, overtaking the police after rapid expansion driven by geopolitical tensions following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, according to new research by de Volkskrant. At the same time, the civil service has grown sharply, and chipmaker ASML has emerged as the fastest-growing private employer.

Defense employed 74,333 full-time equivalent positions at the end of last year, nearly 20 percent more than five years earlier. In the previous de Volkskrant survey, defense and the police were roughly equal at about 62,000 full-time jobs each. Police staffing has since risen by 5.5 percent to 64,618.

“The armed forces face the task of strengthening themselves at high speed,” a Defense Ministry spokesperson said. “It is therefore positive to see that there is a lot of interest in a job with defense.”

Ahold Delhaize ranks third overall and is the largest private employer, with about 97,000 workers in the Netherlands, equivalent to roughly 38,000 full-time jobs. That is 6,000 more than five years ago. The Ministry of Justice and Security follows with nearly 37,000 full-time positions, while Rabobank has about 31,000, a decline of roughly a quarter over five years.

For others, it was a fitting conclusion to a year defined by circular upheaval: consolidation without clarity, innovation without confidence, and regulation without resolve.","With 2026 just days away, take a look at the major stories of 2025 - and their impact across the ad tech landscape…

Mergers old and new reshaped the agency landscape; regulators pushed back against the giants; and Google quietly admitted something few thought possible - that the cookie era might be here to stay after all.

Omnicom and IPG: The year’s defining merger

Last December’s news that Omnicom would acquire IPG sent shockwaves through Madison Avenue. The deal, worth an estimated USD$25bn, promised to create the world’s largest agency network - a marketing behemoth with combined billings dwarfing even WPP’s. Unsurprisingly, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stepped in, flagging concerns that the tie-up could limit competition across media buying, creative services, and data management.

For months, the transaction hovered in limbo. But a revised framework for “cross-stack ad competition” introduced midyear gave the merger new life. By late summer, the FTC cleared the deal, followed in December by unconditional approval from the European Commission. Almost immediately, Omnicom announced a sweeping restructure: 4,000 roles set to go before year-end as it moves to consolidate overlapping units and unify its data strategy under a single global platform.

Consolidation everywhere you look

The mergers kept coming. French-based Equativ sealed its long-discussed union with Sharethrough, forming one of the largest independent ad tech platforms outside the walled gardens. The combined group now boasts significant reach across CTV, programmatic, and supply optimisation.

Meanwhile, Publicis made headlines with its acquisition of Lotame. The move adds Lotame’s data reservoir - roughly 1.6 billion user profiles - to the Groupe’s increasingly ID-driven data stack. Publicis wasted no time folding those audience graphs into its Epsilon offering, pitching enhanced precision targeting just as fragmentation across identifiers reached new highs.

The battle for Warner Bros

In media, the year’s most extraordinary rumour mill centred on Warner Bros Discovery, which officially put itself up for sale. Both Netflix and Paramount Skydance made plays - and Netflix seemed to have the agreement in place. Paramount then lobbed in a USD$108.4bn hostile bid, aiming to outmuscle Netflix’s already massive USD$72bn offer. The board, though, recommended rejecting Paramount’s offer - but few expect this story to end before 2026.

TikTok survives again - with a new flag

Across the Atlantic, political drama continued to define TikTok’s fate. In September, a newly re-elected Donald Trump signed an executive order forcing Chinese parent company ByteDance to transfer US ownership to American investors. The move, framed as a national security measure, effectively prevented a TikTok shutdown in the States - and marked the culmination of a years-long tug of war over the app’s future.

ByteDance eventually reached a binding deal with groups including Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. If completed in early 2026, the agreement will create a separate joint venture for TikTok’s US business, finally putting the app’s legal limbo to rest - at least for now.

Google’s rough year in court

No year-in-review would be complete without Google’s legal woes, and 2025 delivered them in spades. The search giant faced a crushing verdict in April, when Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that it maintained two illegal monopolies across ad tech - one in publisher ad servers, another in exchange technology.

The decision unleashed fresh lawsuits from Magnite and PubMatic, both seeking damages for what they describe as years of exclusionary practices.

Yet the more draconian remedies - a forced breakup or Chrome divestiture - seem increasingly unlikely. Judge Amit Mehta spared the browser from sale in Google’s parallel search antitrust trial, and Brinkema has signalled similar hesitation in the ad tech case. Pending verdicts aside, the industry’s response has been pragmatic: frustration, but little shock. The perceived imbalance between regulators’ power and Big Tech’s legal muscle remains, for now, intact.

AI upends traffic and trust

While courts debated competition, the open web faced a different kind of existential challenge. As AI chatbots and search tools proliferated, referral traffic to publishers cratered. Appfigures and SimilarWeb both recorded steep double-digit declines in click-throughs to news sites across major markets, with much of that traffic diverted to AI-generated summaries.

Publishers responded with lawsuits, block lists, and pleas for licensing deals. Yet the scraping continued and 2025 became, by consensus, the year that open access content was effectively subsumed into large language model training data. One board member of the Independent Publishers Alliance estimated that Google’s new AI-powered search could push a third of its members into closure within a year.

What AI giveth in efficiency, it taketh away in discoverability.

The cookie that wouldn’t crumble

And finally, the year’s most unexpected twist: the third-party cookie lived to see another day. After half a decade of phased plans, pilot schemes, and developer summits, Google officially scrapped its deprecation timeline. Privacy Sandbox was quietly wound down, its core tools shuttered.

The decision, reportedly tied to both antitrust pressure and publisher backlash, sent shockwaves across the ecosystem. After years spent preparing for a “post-cookie world”, advertisers and platforms alike found themselves back where they started - albeit older, wiser, and more cynical about Google’s willingness to change its own rules.

For some, that retreat marked the end of an era. For others, it was a fitting conclusion to a year defined by circular upheaval: consolidation without clarity, innovation without confidence, and regulation without resolve.

The move was orderly on below-average holiday volume, extending a recent winning streak. But with the stock already up over 11% in the prior six sessions, is this merely a tactical news-driven pop or the start of a new leg higher into year-end?

The Groq licensing agreement is a significant strategic move, reinforcing NVIDIA’s dominance in the AI inference market. By acquiring talent and access to Groq’s high-performance technology, NVIDIA is proactively neutralizing a potential competitor and widening its competitive moat.

NVIDIA will pay $20 billion to license Groq’s AI inference technology and hire key personnel.

The deal integrates Groq’s expertise in Language Processing Units (LPUs), enhancing NVDA’s capabilities.

This move is seen as a defensive strategy to address threats from specialized ASIC chip manufacturers.

But here is the interesting part. You are reading about this 1.0% move after it happened. The market has already priced in the news.

Trade Mechanics & Money Flow

Trade Mechanics: What Happened?

The trading mechanics on December 26th suggest a quiet, holiday-thinned market, with institutional players making targeted bets rather than a broad retail chase. The relatively low volume indicates a lack of aggressive, widespread participation, typical for the period between Christmas and New Year’s.

Trading volume was subdued at approximately 137-139 million shares, well below the daily average.

Options activity shows strong bullish sentiment, with significant open interest in calls at the $195 and $200 strike prices.

A large block trade of 26,000 calls expiring in September 2025 suggests institutional conviction in long-term upside.

How Is The Money Flowing?

The footprint of this move appears to be primarily institutional. The subdued volume combined with large, strategic options trades points towards smart money positioning for future growth rather than a retail-driven frenzy.

The quiet nature of the 1.0% move on low volume is characteristic of institutional accumulation.

Retail participation was noted, but the significant block trades in the options market indicate a larger institutional hand.

The stock closed near the psychologically important $190 level, setting up a potential test of higher resistance.

What Next?

FOLLOW. The next key level to watch is $200. This is not just a psychological barrier but also where a significant cluster of call option open interest resides. A decisive break above this level, particularly on increasing volume, would signal a continuation of the uptrend, likely forcing options market makers to hedge their positions and potentially creating a gamma squeeze that could accelerate the move higher.

I think President Trump, you know, his his, he's not a career politician.

American Airlines Is Focusing On Better Connections And Airport Experience Apart from the new schedule, American Airlines has also announced a few other changes to make connections easier and improve the airport experience for travelers.
The press release also reminded passengers that American Airlines is investing in several projects at DFW airport.","This holiday season has been particularly stressful for those planning to catch a flight. A major winter storm, Storm Devin, hit many parts of the Northeast and Midwest immediately after Christmas, leading to thousands of cancellations nationwide — although many U.S. airlines reacted to the storm in the best way possible for passengers.

Meanwhile, on Friday, December 26, American Airlines was forced to cancel 109 flights, one of the highest numbers of cancellations, according to FlightAware. This was in part due to its high number of departures compared to other carriers.

American Airlines has since issued a press release announcing a new flight schedule for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), which will provide “greater resilience and less adverse impact” in the event of bad weather. Here's a closer look at this new plan and how it will affect passengers.

American Airlines Reacts To 109 Cancellations With A New Flight Schedule

On Friday, December 26, American Airlines announced significant changes at its largest and busiest hub, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. The carrier plans to invest millions of dollars to offer a smoother airport experience, enhance connections for travelers on layovers, and improve resilience in case of weather disruptions.

For years, American Airlines’ schedule at its Dallas hub has been divided into nine banks, a term referring to a group of flights operating roughly at the same time. Beginning in April, the airline will introduce a 13-bank structure, adding new time options. Changes to the schedule will become visible today, Saturday, December 27.

What does this mean for passengers?

American Airlines customers will be able to choose from more departures during ""highly desired"" time windows, as well as fewer early-morning flights. According to the carrier, this is ""especially good news for customers making morning connections through DFW.""

These changes will also help the airline recover better when bad weather hits.

“No other airline recovers from bad weather and irregular operations better than American, and the airline has demonstrated that time and time again,"" the company's press release states.

Now, the airline has stated that its new schedule structure will ensure it will ""recover even quicker and get customers on their way as soon as the weather clears."" American Airlines is also investing millions of dollars in remote deplaning capability, which will help the carrier divert fewer flights away from DFW.

American Airlines Canceled 3% Of Its Flights On Boxing Day

On Boxing Day, Friday, December 26, New York, along with many parts of the Northeast and Midwest, was hit by a heavy winter storm, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations. According to the latest advisory from the National Weather Service, published at 5:20 a.m. EST on Saturday, December 27, a winter storm warning will remain in effect until 10 a.m.

Delta Air Lines was the U.S. carrier with the most cancellations on Friday, with 254 flights canceled, representing about 7% of its scheduled departures for the day. JetBlue followed it with 232 cancellations, representing 23% of its total flights.

American Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest only had to cancel 3% of their scheduled departures. The airports that were hit hardest were John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), which reported 159 and 107 cancellations, respectively.

At the moment, it seems that travel disruptions will continue today. Flight Radar reports 131 cancellations at JFK, 85 at La Guardia Airport (LGA), and 70 at Newark Liberty (EWR). For now, American Airlines has been forced to cancel 1% of its departures, for a total of 57 flights, while JetBlue is at the top with 159 cancellations. However, American, along with United Airlines and JetBlue, have responded in kind to passengers amid all the Storm Devin cancellations; the three told Reuters they have waived change and re-booking fees.

According to American Airlines’ press release, bad weather is a serious issue for the carrier, especially at DFW, where thunderstorms have recently forced the entire airport to pause. Apart from the new flight schedule at DFW, the carrier is also investing in a better airport experience for its customers and smoother connections.

American Airlines Is Focusing On Better Connections And Airport Experience

Apart from the new schedule, American Airlines has also announced a few other changes to make connections easier and improve the airport experience for travelers. The new schedule is now reducing extremely short layovers, leading to a less stressful travel experience.

In addition, the company launched an AI tool at DFW Airport in May 2025. This helps connecting passengers get to their second flight by ensuring pilots wait for them in case of delays, when possible. The company has recently announced it will now use this technology in five additional airports.

The press release also reminded passengers that American Airlines is investing in several projects at DFW airport. These include modernizing its airport facilities and adding extra piers, resulting in 31 new gates by 2030.

While American Airlines claims to be the best U.S. carrier at handling flight disruptions caused by bad weather, on December 27, it reported the same cancellation rate as United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. Only time will tell whether this new schedule will make a real difference.",https://static0.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2233806869-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-28 04:57:54.001434

Ethiopian Airlines has marked a significant milestone by completing Africa’s first full strip-and-paint process on its Airbus A350-900 fleet, setting a new standard in aircraft maintenance on the continent. This achievement highlights the airline’s advanced maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) capabilities, reinforcing its leadership in operational efficiency and fleet durability.

Advancing Maintenance Capabilities

The full strip-and-paint procedure involves the meticulous removal of all existing paint layers, followed by a comprehensive repainting of the aircraft. This complex process is essential for preserving the structural integrity of the aircraft, enhancing its aesthetic appeal, and improving fuel efficiency by reducing aerodynamic drag. By investing in the necessary technology and infrastructure to perform such high-level maintenance internally, Ethiopian Airlines has significantly reduced its dependence on external service providers, thereby strengthening its competitive position within the aviation sector.

The airline’s technical team ensured that the process adhered to stringent international standards, underscoring Ethiopian Airlines’ unwavering commitment to safety and operational excellence. The Airbus A350-900, renowned for its fuel efficiency and cutting-edge technology, forms a critical component of the airline’s long-haul fleet. Maintaining these aircraft in optimal condition is vital to delivering a safe and comfortable experience for passengers.

Industry Context and Strategic Implications

This development occurs amid heightened industry scrutiny over quality and software issues affecting Airbus’s A320 family. While Ethiopian Airlines’ current focus remains on the A350-900, the broader concerns surrounding Airbus products may prompt competitors and regulators to intensify their examination of fleet maintenance practices. Such scrutiny could influence investor confidence, as apprehensions about potential operational disruptions and the impact on Airbus’s reputation may affect purchasing decisions and fleet management strategies across the global aviation industry.

Ethiopian Airlines’ successful execution of the full strip-and-paint process on both its Boeing 787 and Airbus A350-900 fleets places it among a select group of global carriers capable of conducting such advanced maintenance in-house. This strategic initiative aligns with the airline’s broader vision to expand its MRO capabilities, fostering greater self-sufficiency and resilience in an increasingly competitive market.

Why it matters: Social media has been full of questions about what the unusual arrangement means for Groq employees — both those heading to Nvidia and those staying put.

Catch up quick: Groq and Nvidia on Wednesday announced a ""non-exclusive licensing agreement,"" with media reports accurately pegging the deal value at around $20 billion.

The companies said that Groq CEO Jonathan Ross and president Sunny Madra would join Nvidia, while Groq would continue to operate as a standalone company led by new CEO Simon Edwards (who had been CFO).

It's an unusual structure, but the latest in a recent spate of Big AI deals that seem designed to avoid tripping antitrust wires.

Behind the scenes: Most Groq shareholders will receive per-share distributions tied to the $20 billion valuation, according to sources.

Around 85% will be paid up-front, while another 10% is paid midyear 2026 and the remainder at the end of 2026.

Around 90% of Groq employees are said to be joining Nvidia, and they will be paid cash for all vested shares. Their unvested shares will be paid out at the $20 billion valuation, but via Nvidia stock that vests on a schedule.

There are also around 50 members of that group whose entire stock packages are being accelerated and paid out in cash.

Remaining Groq employees will also be paid for vested shares, plus will receive a package that includes economic participation in the ongoing company.

Any Groq employee — staying or leaving — with the company for less than one year will have their vesting cliff dropped, so they can get some up-front liquidity.

By the numbers: Groq had raised around $3.3 billion in venture capital funding since its 2016 founding, including a $750 million infusion this past fall at nearly a $7 billion post-money valuation.

Backers include Social Capital, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, Samsung, 1789 Capital, Cisco, D1, Cleo Capital, Altimeter, Firestreak Ventures, Conversion Capital and Modi Venture.

The company has never done a secondary tender for either employees or investors.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) is one of the one of the stocks Jim Cramer was bullish on due to share buyback activity. Cramer said, “we think the world of” the company’s CEO, as he commented:

“Fourth is a bank that I’ve come to like very much over the past couple years, and that’s BNY, the old Bank of New York Mellon. BNY shrunk its share count by 36.2% since the end of 2015, even if the stock wasn’t a real outperformer until more recently. Under CEO Robin Vince, we think the world of him, a Goldman Sachs alum who’s been leading BNY for the past three years or so. The nation’s oldest bank has found new life. They focus on selling their entire suite of financial services to investors rather than marketing this stuff as one-off products. And they’ve also leaned heavily into technology, including AI, maybe the most of all the banks I follow. It’s truly working as the stock’s nearly tripled in a little more than two years.”

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) provides financial services, including investment management, custody, clearing, and wealth planning. The company also offers banking, trading, and cash management solutions. Cramer mentioned the company during the July 15 episode and remarked:

“This morning, everybody was focused on the numbers from the big banks, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup, but they were also watching the report from BNY, and that’s the old Bank of New York Mellon. This is one of the top custodial banks in America. And this morning, BNY reported another strong quarter with easy top and bottom line beats, not to mention a stunning nearly 28% return on something called tangible common equity. That’s one of the best results I’ve ever seen from a bank. BNY even raised its full-year net interest income forecast with the quarter. Very few did that.”

ID32,Nvidia,2025-12-21 15:02:12+00:00,The Motley Fool,1 Big Reason Why Today's Value Investors Won't Find Tomorrow's Nvidia | The Motley Fool,"Jon Quast, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/12/20/1-big-reason-why-todays-value-investors-wont-find/,"But many value investors would have never invested in Nvidia because they think about value in the wrong way.
Why value investors missed Nvidia Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks.
Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.
Returning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019.
The takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability.","In his 1992 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, said, ""We think the very term 'value investing' is redundant."" In other words, seeking value is the only way to invest. Given Buffett's affinity for value investing and his incredible success over the years, many investors seek to emulate his approach to stocks.

Unfortunately, most value investors miss the forest for the trees. And I'll explain how by using Nvidia (NVDA +3.80%) -- the best-performing large-cap stock of the past decade -- as an example.

Yes, I know it's a cherry-picked example. But many value investors would have never invested in Nvidia because they think about value in the wrong way. It's important to recognize the misconception that holds investors back from life-changing opportunities.

Why value investors missed Nvidia

Value investing aims to buy cheap stocks. And cheapness is measured by comparing the value of the company with something from its financial results, including profits.

Let's say a company is valued at $50 billion and only has $50 million in net income. This stock would be valued at 1,000 times its earnings. In other words, its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio (a popular valuation metric) would be 1,000. Another $50 billion company that earns $5 billion in net income would have a P/E of 10, which would be 100 times cheaper.

In 2019, Nvidia's market cap, the value of the company, was around $100 billion. But its average P/E ratio for the year was 35, as the chart below shows.

The average P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is somewhere around 25. Anything above that has an above-average valuation and is considered expensive by value investors. Nvidia in 2019, therefore, would have been too pricey to buy.

Value investors believe that the best value stocks to buy trade at a P/E ratio below the average. And often, value investors think that the cheaper a stock is, the better.

However, Nvidia has gone on to outperform virtually every other publicly traded company since the start of 2020, despite having an above-average P/E ratio. In short, value investing, as traditionally approached, prevented some investors from buying one of the greatest stocks of our time.

How to improve the value mindset

There's another important quote from Buffett that needs to be considered here. In the same letter, he wrote, ""Growth is always a component in the calculation of value."" In other words, value investors must look ahead when looking for a bargain.

Herein lies the problem with value investing as it's usually done: The P/E ratio (and others) measures past results. But investors must buy stocks today, looking ahead to what the business results could be tomorrow.

Returning to Nvidia stock, the P/E ratio looked pricey in 2019. But the P/E ratio didn't reflect the company's superb future earnings growth. As the chart below shows, the stock price is up nearly 3,000% in the last five years, but its earnings per share (EPS) are up even more than that.

Nvidia has earned $100 billion in net income over the past year. The stock traded at 35 times trailing earnings in 2019, which looked expensive. But for those with foresight, the entire value of the company then was equal to its profits right now, which is about as cheap as a stock could possibly be.

On a personal note, I missed Nvidia stock in 2019, not because of its pricey P/E ratio, but rather because I didn't foresee earnings growth of this magnitude. I didn't believe that the current build-out for AI infrastructure would be so big and last for so long. And in a traditionally cyclical space, I worried that overestimating demand would lead to lower margins at Nvidia.

I was dead wrong, and that underscores why investing is hard. Looking at a P/E ratio or a market cap is easy. Predicting where the world is going, how a company is positioned, and what that means financially is a tall order. It's why even the best investors often make mistakes.

The takeaway is that, to find tomorrow's Nvidia, investors must balance backward-looking valuation metrics with a forward-looking outlook for the business, such as how it will grow and what growth will do for profitability. The best stocks for the next 10 years might not look like value stocks right now. But they will be a tremendous value in hindsight.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F847355%2Fyoung-man-sitting-pensively-at-his-computer-looking-thoughtfully-at-the-screen-in-front-of-him.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-21 11:01:15.684515

“These segments are best suited for electrification because of their economics, limited charging needs and alignment with urban mobility patterns.” In India, electric two-wheelers will remain the backbone of EV adoption due to their affordability and daily-use economics.
“Battery localisation is not just a manufacturing challenge—it is a strategic imperative,” Bharadwaj said.
“Electrification has moved firmly into the mainstream, but battery localisation has not kept pace.
“Whoever cracks scale, cost efficiency and supply resilience in batteries will define the next phase of EV leadership in India,” Bharadwaj said.","Electric two-wheelers will continue to anchor electric vehicle (EV) adoption in India, while passenger cars are set to emerge as the fastest-growing segment from 2026, according to a recent assessment by Capgemini. The consulting firm said strong total cost of ownership benefits, improving charging access and rapid digitisation of vehicles will drive the next phase of EV growth across regions and city tiers.

“Globally, passenger cars will still dominate EV volumes, but in markets like India the deepest penetration will come from two- and three-wheelers and last-mile commercial vehicles,” said Anuraag Bharadwaj, Industry Platform Leader for Automotive – India at Capgemini. “These segments are best suited for electrification because of their economics, limited charging needs and alignment with urban mobility patterns.”

In India, electric two-wheelers will remain the backbone of EV adoption due to their affordability and daily-use economics. At the same time, passenger EVs are expected to see sharp year-on-year growth as charging infrastructure expands and product options widen across cities.

Beyond the Sale

Technology is also reshaping the two-wheeler segment. Digital display clusters are increasingly mirroring car infotainment systems, offering connected features such as navigation, diagnostics and content playback. Alongside this, software-defined vehicles (SDVs) are beginning to alter OEM business models in India. “OEMs are clearly looking beyond one-time vehicle sales,” Bharadwaj said. “Subscriptions, connected services and feature-led monetisation will become increasingly important revenue streams as consumers become more value-conscious.”

Profitability Gap

However, even as adoption accelerates, Capgemini cautioned that EV profitability in India remains constrained by weak battery localisation. Batteries account for nearly 40% of an EV’s total cost, making them the most expensive component. While localisation has improved in vehicle assembly and electronics integration, domestic battery cell manufacturing remains limited, forcing automakers to rely on imports from China and other markets.

“Battery localisation is not just a manufacturing challenge—it is a strategic imperative,” Bharadwaj said. “Electrification has moved firmly into the mainstream, but battery localisation has not kept pace. Without a strong domestic ecosystem for cell manufacturing and raw material processing, EV profitability in India will remain structurally constrained.” In the interim, mainstream automakers such as Mahindra are sourcing advanced battery technologies like Blade cells from BYD, a configuration expected in upcoming models including the Maruti eVitara and the Toyota Urban Cruiser EV.

Government incentives under the Production Linked Incentive scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell batteries have triggered gigafactory announcements, but Capgemini said their impact on vehicle costs will be felt only over the medium term. “Whoever cracks scale, cost efficiency and supply resilience in batteries will define the next phase of EV leadership in India,” Bharadwaj said.",https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/12/capgemini.reuters_20250918174936_20251218154439_20251221142311.jpg?quality=100,N,,2025-12-21 11:00:59.375773

What Walled Gardens Look Like in 3D Printing The 3D printing walled garden is the hardware, firmware, cloud slicer, material profiles, model repositories, and support resources, among other elements.
Privacy issues are a real concern in a world increasingly reliant on 3D printers for manufacturing, and studies have shown that IP theft is a significant risk in 3D printing.
A Buyer’s Guide to Walled Gardens in 3D Printing Which Printers Are 'Open' and Which Are 'Closed'?
3D printing is going mainstream, and mainstream means “make it easy.” Easy usually comes with walls.","Remember when desktop 3D printing felt like the Wild West? A decade ago, anyone with a printer, some filament, and a free weekend could grab models from Thingiverse, tweak a few slicer settings, and let the machine run overnight. The process—and the prints that resulted from it—were chaotic, messy, and often frustrating, but it was also…fun? It felt like the Mos Eisley Cantina on Tatooine, and it was, arguably, glorious.

That free-for-all experimentation era is fading fast, though. In its place? Carefully curated, tightly controlled “walled gardens” where companies make not only the hardware but also the software, the consumables, and the very marketplace where files are shared. It’s the iOS ecosystem, but for 3D printers. And the kicker? While there are protests from the edges, for the most part, it actually works, and people are growing to love it.

Keep Them Coming Back for More

When I was a young engineer starting out, I worked for an automated machinery company that serviced the sewing goods industry. Sewing machines have hundreds of moving parts, and they wear out over time. My employer took me aside once and showed me one of those parts in a spare bin. He rolled it in his hand like a poker chip. The tone in his voice grew somber as he said to me, “See this plate? This costs us $15 to import. We sell it for $400. It wears out, on average, every 4 to 6 months. Always remember: Whenever possible, sell the stapler and the staples.”

He explained to me that for the business to continue running—and to grow and keep everyone employed—the initial purchase of the machinery couldn’t be a customer's only purchase. Parts and supplies like these, with incredibly high markups, were what kept the lights on. A customer who bought a machine from us could spend upward of five to 10 times more than the cost of the machine itself over its lifespan.

Fast-forward to now. I'm no longer hawking sewing machine parts. Instead, I'm writing this story in my home office, where I tinker with and test all sorts of gadgets, including 3D printers. The office is filled with not just printers, but also filament, resin, and spare parts: ""staples,"" from floor to ceiling. Plenty of other hobbyists' and entrepreneurs' home offices look just like mine, which makes you quickly realize the oodles of cash that are up for grabs selling 3D printing accessories.

So it's only natural that the walled gardens of 3D printing are growing taller, as the big players have emerged and dug in. Depending on where you stand, that’s either a long-overdue correction or the beginning of a slow suffocation. A feature, or a fetter.

What Walled Gardens Look Like in 3D Printing

The 3D printing walled garden is the hardware, firmware, cloud slicer, material profiles, model repositories, and support resources, among other elements. If you want to print, you’re encouraged—and sometimes forced—to use only what the company that made your printer sells. This is happening in two universes at the moment: The consumer side, which is what we mostly cover at PCMag, and the professional side, where many American and European companies have found respite from Chinese competitors for the time being.

Compare that to the “open” 3D printing world that I, along with many other pioneering hobbyists, grew up in, and which still exists but is fading rapidly. In that world, you can download models from a dozen free sites, slice them in Cura or PrusaSlicer, and run whatever filament happens to be on sale this week. Need a new gasket for a DIY repair, perhaps? Don't order it from Amazon or even McMaster-Carr. Just print your own on an open-source printer. It’s cheaper, but it’s also messier and more time-consuming.

This phenomenon isn't novel, of course. Printer—paper printer—manufacturers have been pulling this trick for decades by making proprietary ink cartridges. A decade ago, HP tried to block the use of third-party ink via firmware, making you fear bricking your own printer if you tried to use another vendor’s ink. (HP later abandoned this effort, at least in part.) Apple’s App Store lives on the same principle. I can’t share songs I purchase on my Android phone with my wife, who is browsing the iTunes store next to me as I write this.

The difference, though, is that in 3D printing, the stakes involve not just money but reliability, safety, and speed—things that can make or break a newbie’s first impression.

Why Companies Are Raising the Walls

If you’re wondering why companies are doubling down on lock-ins and gathering as many customers as they can into their respective gardens, the answer is simple: control.

Support Costs Drop When You Control Every Variable

Think about it from the company's perspective: Fewer random filaments means fewer angry customers sending failed print photos to your support team—the “Why is this piece of junk not working?” tickets. It also means fewer nozzles you have to ship out, at your cost, to keep their flaming fingers out of the forums and Facebook groups long enough to get them past the jam they caused with bargain-basement filament.

Safety Improves When Resins and Filaments Are Vetted

Fewer toxic fumes mean fewer mechanical misfires. Formlabs, maker of the Form 4 I recently reviewed, claims to have eliminated the dangerous VOCs found in many resins and uses ISO certification in its resins and other ancillary products to maintain consistency. The Form 4 is therefore a favorite of pros who know exactly why things like tensile strength, tensile modulus, elongation, and heat deflection are critical.

Performance Is More Consistent

Tuned profiles mean smoother prints and fewer headaches. When I was coming up in the hobby, it was assumed that you were always tweaking and adjusting; printing calibration cubes, Benchies, and temperature towers. If you didn’t know how to do those things, you were a newbie to be pitied, and most of your prints probably failed.

Those days are long gone. I recently tested the Bambu Lab H2S, which not only comes with pre-tuned slicer settings for every Bambu Lab filament but also includes equivalent settings for nearly every major filament supplier. I tested both, with flawless results and no tuning or futzing required.

Recurring Revenue From Accessories Keeps the Lights On

Printers are often sold at razor-thin margins; filament and resin make up the difference. Here's some napkin math: Assuming we’re talking about a larger brand, the gross margin on filament sales is somewhere between 40% and 70%. The net margin on 3D printers, on the other hand (after all costs and overhead), is maybe 20% or 25%. When you buy a $1,500 printer, the company makes $300 in profits. Assuming you use 50 spools of filament a year per printer, that’s another $500 per year for the life of the machine. Keeping you in the garden is good for business.

Data Loops Build Better Machines

Telemetry on what succeeds and fails feeds back into better slicers, better defaults, and tighter ecosystems. Web-connected slicers like Bambu Studio bring files offsite to a cloud server and back again, which has me concerned about possible IP theft, but let's face it: If Bambu Lab knows all about the file you were printing in a machine that can measure (via cameras and sensors) how the print went, it can learn from failed prints. Tesla monitors all the data from cars using its Full Self-Driving feature to improve the AI that makes driving decisions, and 3D printer companies can take a similar approach. Instead of telemetry data and speeds, it’s g-code and video. No one I’ve ever met who owns a Tesla is mad that their driving data goes back to the corporation, because they know it’s improving their experience. Data loops within the walled garden perform the same function.

If you were raised like me, printing your 3D bits from USB keys instead of via a web app, this can be a hard leap to make. But let's not forget that life outside the garden isn't free from data-sharing pitfalls, either. In 2021, a Thingiverse data breach potentially exposed data from hundreds of thousands of users.

The Upside for Users

Let’s be honest: most people don’t want to fiddle with firmware, PID tuning, or slicer voodoo. They want the print to work the first time. Walled gardens are delivering that in spades. People are loyal to their brands as a result, with the term “fanboy” tossed around more frequently than ever. If you are a Prusa, Bambu Lab, or Creality convert, you know that the energy in those forums is akin to football fans arguing over which team is going to win the Super Bowl this year. And fandom has its concrete benefits.

First-Print Success Rates Skyrocket

A beginner can unbox, click Print, and hold a finished part hours later. I’ve met people who’ve never had a first-layer issue, while back in the day, I would spend hours fighting with my Creality Ender 3, invoking all sorts of remedies, including hairspray, glue sticks, and prayers to whatever deity was listening, to get to the second layer.

Time Savings Are Real

No more spending 3 hours browsing a forum thread to fix a stringing issue: The maker world moves faster than it ever has. I met three vendors at a maker festival in September who cumulatively had about 500 articulated figurines for sale: $5 for three. These people earn their living from these fairs and don’t have time to spare fixing things.

Quality Is Better

Tuned profiles and real-time monitoring reduce the likelihood of failure. I recently had a client come to me asking to reverse-engineer the transparent dome light on his cooking range. The manufacturer didn’t make replacement parts, and so I scanned it and printed it with the Form 4 using Formlabs' Transparent V3 resin, which I know to be dimensionally accurate. The part measured 2.95 inches wide (75.05mm, to be exact), and it was a perfect fit.

I happily pay more for the resin, knowing I can take on those types of jobs and produce an engineered replacement that measures up to what I designed in my CAD software. There's no Wild West aspect, so the experience isn't a nail-biter, but I get great prints with pre-tuned dimensional accuracy.

Safety

Certified materials and built-in interlocks aren’t just marketing; they prevent accidents. When I load the 10-watt laser module into the Bambu Lab H2S and go to cut a part from 3mm-thick birchboard, there’s a QR code sticker in the corner that tells the cutter exactly what material I’m using. It knows what power levels to use and how fast to move the laser through the wood—all the things it needs to avoid setting the board on fire and burning my house down. I trust that over my late-night intuition just before I go to bed, with best guesses driving my g-code. I’ll pay more for that, as will most people, especially when I first start working with new materials I’m unfamiliar with.

The Downsides

Of course, just like an actual wall, the walled-garden approach has multiple sides, and there are plenty of negative ones.

Costs Creep Upward

Proprietary filaments and resins cost more, and some companies use DRM chips to prevent you from using third-party resin. It can get even more extreme than that: The Form 4 and other Formlabs printers prevent owners from using whatever resin they want in their machines unless they pay hefty unlocking fees.

Innovation Slows

When companies dictate what’s allowed, experimental materials and techniques get buried. Once a company can build a large enough user base, it controls the pace of development, as opposed to the early days when innovation leaps were required to punch through into the market.

It takes a ""black swan"" innovator to force everyone with a walled garden to catch up quickly. I believe we’re seeing this now with Snapmaker’s U1 multi-toolhead printer, which has raised more than $20.6 million on Kickstarter at this writing. Bambu Lab is now attempting to compete with its upcoming Vortek tool-changing accessory.

Marketplaces Gatekeep

File visibility isn’t always merit-based; it’s algorithmic. That means the best designs don’t always win—the best thumbnails do. When you control the keys to the kingdom, you control what files people are potentially printing on your machines.

Data Is Extracted

Every print you slice in the cloud reveals information about you, your projects, and your habits to the vendor. Privacy issues are a real concern in a world increasingly reliant on 3D printers for manufacturing, and studies have shown that IP theft is a significant risk in 3D printing. The larger the garden and the more dependent users are on it compounds the possibility of theft or hacking. There’s a tremendous element of trust involved.

Longevity Questions Loom

What happens if the company shuts down its servers or moves on from your model of printer? Suddenly, your “ecosystem” is a paperweight. This has plenty of precedent, too: Google recently discontinued the smart features of older Nest thermostats.

The only company currently providing a robust path forward for upgrades is Prusa, which is arguably being left behind in terms of features as a result. While you can turn a Prusa MK3 or MK4 into a Core One, the Core One simply doesn’t compare to an H2D or H2S, Bambu Lab’s latest models.

A Buyer’s Guide to Walled Gardens in 3D Printing

Which Printers Are 'Open' and Which Are 'Closed'?

Prusa printers are arguably the most un-walled mainstream printers out there. The company's Printables is free and open-source, though it lacks the same monetized incentive structure of Bambu Lab's MakerWorld.

Formlabs is mostly closed. Its resin and software ecosystem is locked tight, but its users largely accept it because the quality is unmatched, with dimensionally tuned and accurate outputs. Want your parts to fit together properly? You need Formlabs resin.

Stratasys has always been closed. For enterprise buyers, that’s the point: certifications, compliance, security, and contracts matter more than tinkering. Like Formlabs, Stratasys—and subsidiaries like Ultimaker—have largely retreated to the educational and professional space, with a dwindling number of consumer models available.

Elegoo, Anycubic, Qidi, and Creality occupy a fuzzier space. They've largely been open, but are moving toward curated slicers and marketplaces. Everyone sees where the market is headed, and no one wants to be left behind. Each of these companies has its own filament and resin lines, with virtually every possible color and polymer available, and “pre-tuned” slicer settings in Cura or Orca to get you started quickly without fiddling.

So, should you buy into one of these gardens? It depends on what you want.

If you prioritize reliability, enter the garden. You’ll spend more, but you’ll save time and frustration. If someone were to ask me what a good first 3D printer to buy is, and I wanted them to have the easiest setup and most enjoyable experience, I would drop them off from a theoretical helicopter directly into the middle of Bambu Lab’s garden.

If you love tinkering, stay outside. Cheap filament, third-party slicers, wild mods—the Wild West is disappearing, but it's not gone. If I were on a spaceship that needed to survive a 100-year mission, I would bring a Prusa with me, along with 10,000 rolls of Prusament. Blessed are the tinkerers, and they all wear black-and-orange shirts.

If you have the space and budget for two printers, buy one of each. Use the polished ecosystem for mission-critical prints, and reserve the tinkerer’s machine for experiments with unconventional filaments and techniques. My LulzBot TAZ 5 has been printing for 10 years now. I can put any filament I want into it (I create a makeshift heated chamber by throwing an emergency blanket over it) and keep the earliest phases of my IP private in my office. Just keep your eyes open for red flags: consumables with DRM, printers that function only via cloud slicing, or companies with a history of abandoning products.

What Will the Walled Garden of the Future Bring?

I’d bet on more walls, not fewer. Expect:

Creator subscriptions and “pro” packs. This seems inevitable to me. Platforms like MakerWorld will become more like Spotify, and designers will rise as a result.

Smarter, telemetry-driven auto-profiles. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, it’s hard to envision a world where it isn’t embedded in a machine's ROM to monitor prints via sensors and cameras.

Partially walled gardens, in which vendors still allow escape hatches but prefer you don’t use them. Bambu Lab and Formlabs provide exit hatches for third-party filaments and resins, and I suppose see the necessity of a door in and out of the garden.

Lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny. If it’s illegal for HP to stop people from loading third-party ink cartridges, as some customers have (so far unsuccessfully) argued in court, it’s inevitable that regulation will catch up to what is arguably an analogous situation with 3D printers.

The genie’s out of the bottle. 3D printing is going mainstream, and mainstream means “make it easy.” Easy usually comes with walls. The walled gardens of 3D printing aren’t inherently evil. In many cases, they make the tech more reliable, safer, and far more approachable for the average hobbyist. Without them, adoption would stall.

But make no mistake: Every convenience comes at a cost. If you step into a garden, know the price of admission, and know that the gate may not always stay open. The best gardens don’t just protect the company—they protect the users and the creators, too.

If vendors get that balance right, maybe a wall doesn’t have to feel like a prison. Maybe it can feel like an amusement park—curated, safe, and pleasant, but just exciting enough to be worth wandering into.",https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/05w23Zdc93miv2kx7tU2mqh-7.fit_lim.size_1200x630.v1766003609.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 08:59:52.091490

But in the spirit of the festive season, here are a few reasons to hope for a happier new year.

The first is that, barring external forces, 2026 should not involve a repeat of this year’s fiscal drama.

Rachel Reeves more than doubled the margin of error, or headroom, against her fiscal rules at last month’s budget, and that should gift the Treasury a quieter 2026.

The chancellor’s spring statement should be a non-event for another reason, too: she announced that while the Office for Budget Responsibility will still carry out a forecast, it will not formally assess her against the rules.

So as some wise men – and women – advised her to do last year, even if there has been a marked deterioration in the outlook, Reeves intends to stand firm until the autumn budget. That would mark a welcome contrast with the tax and spend saga of the past year (though if Labour MPs choose to change the top team in Downing Street, the drama would be very much back on).

A second reason for optimism is that after a gloomy year, recent surveys have included glimmers of hope.

Official figures show Britain’s economy unexpectedly shrank in October. But the snapshot is backward-looking, assessing how activity had fared through the rear-view mirror. The latest flash purchasing managers index for December, published by data provider S&P Global, suggests things could be improving. The reading on its monthly index jumped to 52.1, from 51.2 in November – with 50 marking the divide between growth and contraction.

In the private sector, S&P said, “the rise in new business was the strongest for 14 months and mainly reflected a solid improvement in demand across the service economy”.

It would make sense that if, as many business groups have claimed, the chaotic budget buildup killed confidence, we should get a modest uptick in activity now that it is over.

Neil Carberry, the chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, says that chimes with what he is hearing from member companies.

“There was a general sense that things got quite a lot better from the first week of September, and October, then the brakes went on a little bit in November, because of pre-budget chat.”

He adds: “[Hiring] won’t come back this month because it’s December, but quite a few people are quite hopeful about what comes through in January and February.”

A third source of optimism is the hope that consumers could respond positively to the latest Bank of England rate cut, the government’s £150-a-year energy bills relief package, and an end to months of tedious speculation over tax.

There are plenty of reasons for caution here. Not least a reluctance at the Bank to cut rates much further, despite weakness in the labour market.

But if cheaper mortgages and energy bills do help to ease the squeeze, and – whisper it – restore a bit of feelgood factor, the evidence suggests some consumers could have some financial capacity to respond.

The household savings rate – the share of income workers put away for a rainy day – has jumped to well above the long-run average since the Covid pandemic. In the second quarter of this year, it was running at 10.7% – about 2.5 percentage points higher than the 1987-2019 average.

Analysis by Michael Saunders, a former Bank rate setter, now of the consultancy Oxford Economics, suggests a heightened sense of financial insecurity is one explanation. After the jarring shock of Covid shutdowns, the energy price spike, and soaring interest rates, that would make sense.

He is concerned this higher propensity to save could “cap consumer spending growth” for some time to come, dampening the economic recovery. But viewed in a festive spirit of optimism, it does indicate a capacity for some households to loosen their belts a little, if the mood should take them.

The fourth reason for hope is even more tentative, but potentially significant: recent productivity data has been improving.

In what Andrew Wishart of Berenberg bank called recently “the good news story of the year”, the key measure of economic output per worker (vital for lifting wages and living standards) rose by 1% in the first half of 2025. This puts productivity “on course to record one of its better years since the global financial crisis of 2008-2009”.

In some labour-intensive sectors, where there have been job cuts following Reeves’s changes to employer national insurance contributions (NICs), that is little more than a mathematical effect – fewer workers for a given level of GDP means more output per worker.

But Wishart’s early analysis also suggests productivity gains in other sectors, including IT. “We could plausibly be witnessing the beginnings of a boost from artificial intelligence,” he argues.

As Reeves’s former chief economic adviser, the London School of Economics academic John Van Reenen has long argued, UK businesses have tended to underinvest in technology and innovation, leaning instead on the plentiful supply of cheap workers.

Part of the largely unspoken logic of raising the minimum wage and employer NICs – which drove up the cost of hiring – was to tip the balance towards productivity-enhancing investment and innovation, which should be good for growth. Much, though, depends on the labour market’s capacity to re-absorb the workers laid-off in the process.

Lower interest rates from the Bank would help here, plus there are some indications that wage inflation is falling away. That could perhaps open the door to more rapid reductions.

While the headlines point to a bleak midwinter for the UK economy, if you apply enough festive cheer it is just about possible to imagine a better 2026.
