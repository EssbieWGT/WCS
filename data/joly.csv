Risks

Distribution transition costs -- Ongoing transition to a new US third-party logistics center increased transitory costs, with continued impact expected through fiscal 2026.

Q1 operating margin contraction -- Operating margin for fiscal Q1 2026 projected to contract versus prior year, primarily due to timing of marketing spend and the continuing tariff impact.

Inventory increase -- Year-end inventory dollars increased 9%, primarily because of tariffs, which may pressure margins if not managed as planned.

Summary

Levi Strauss (LEVI 3.67%) reported broad-based 7% organic net revenue growth for the fiscal year, with strong performance across DTC and diversification in non-denim categories contributing meaningfully. DTC accounted for roughly half of sales, expanding 11% with notable margin gains and high single-digit comps. The company achieved its highest annual gross margin and announced a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program, signaling capital return confidence. DTC growth was driven by digital initiatives, including proprietary AI tools, and enhanced operational leverage, while supply chain transitions and tariffs posed headwinds but were countered by price increases and efficiency gains. Looking forward, management guided for 4%-5% organic revenue growth, high single-digit DTC growth, flat-to-slightly-up wholesale, and EBIT margin expansion in fiscal 2026, with gross margin pressured by tariffs but mitigated with pricing actions.

Adjusted SG&A expenses rose due to increased selling costs, distribution transition, and foreign exchange, but are targeted for 40-60 basis point rate improvement in fiscal 2026 through AI adoption and restricted headcount growth.

Diversification efforts resulted in a third of fiscal 2025 growth originating from non-denim categories, particularly in tops and international markets, with women's business outperforming at 11% growth.

Europe outperformed with 10% revenue growth in the quarter and operating margin rising 330 basis points, while the UK and Germany posted double-digit gains.

Inventory management focused on reducing SKU count by 20%-25% and globalizing product lines, as end-to-end lead time fell from 16-17 months to 14 months.

Major consumer pricing actions were launched in the US, and the company asserted brand-driven pricing power after observing no negative consumer response to increases.

New global campaign debuting at the Super Bowl marks increased marketing investment and brand emphasis, which will front-load Q1 expenses but position the brand for continued momentum.

Please note that Michelle and Harmit will be referencing organic net revenues or constant currency numbers unless otherwise noted, and information provided is on continuing operations. Finally, this call is being webcast on our IR website, and a replay of this call will be available on the website shortly.

Today's call is scheduled for one hour, so please limit yourself to one question at a time to allow others to have their questions addressed. And now I'd like to turn over the call to Michelle.

Michelle Gass: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to today's call. The fourth quarter punctuated a strong year defined by progress against our strategy, accelerating brand momentum, and solid financial performance. Over the past two years, we've taken bold steps on our journey to become a DTC-first head-to-toe denim lifestyle retailer. We've made deliberate strategic choices to maximize the potential of the Levi's brand, narrow our focus by exiting non-core businesses, and vigorously pursue our highest return growth opportunities. We are becoming a more consumer-focused DTC-centric lifestyle company, which has led to faster growth and higher profitability. These efforts led to strong full-year financial results.

In 2025, we delivered organic net revenue growth of 7%, which was broad-based across all facets of our business. Here are a few key highlights for the year. As a reminder, all numbers Harmit and I will reference are on an organic basis. First, the Levi's brand grew 7%. Levi's strengthened its standing as the number one denim brand in the world and today holds more market share than the next two global competitors combined. Second, we took a big step forward in our evolution to becoming a true lifestyle apparel brand by bringing to market our most robust head-to-toe product pipeline to date. This drove growth across channels and meaningfully increased our total addressable market.

Third, we accelerated our DTC transformation, growing 11%, which now comprises approximately half of our total business. Importantly, we saw significant DTC margin expansion in 2025, as we delivered high single-digit comp growth for the year and a more efficient operating structure in both stores and e-commerce. Fourth, our wholesale channel continued to deliver more stable growth, ending the year up 4%, fueled by our expanded lifestyle assortment as well as new distribution. Fifth, our growth in women's continued to accelerate, up 11% for the year, with both tops and bottoms delivering double-digit growth in addition to 5% growth in men's.

And while we drove significant top-line growth, we also delivered our highest ever gross margin as well as adjusted EBIT margin expansion. Now turning to details of the fourth quarter. Total company revenues increased 5% on top of 8% growth last year. And this momentum continued through the holidays, with 7% growth during the November holiday season, reflecting strength across both DTC and wholesale channels. This marked our highest revenue for the holiday period in at least a decade. First, I will walk you through the progress made against our brand-led strategy, which centers around how we're amplifying the power of the Levi's brand through an innovative and fresh product pipeline and culturally relevant marketing.

The Levi's brand grew 4%, driven by strength in men's and even in Q4, higher growth in women's. Growth in men's and women's continues to be driven by both our core as well as the newness we've introduced throughout our assortment. A testament to the strength of the brand, in 2025, we cemented our number one position in men's, women's, and in our key youth demographic of 18 to 30-year-olds in the US. These share gains are supported by strong brand heat, reflected by higher social media engagement and meaningful gains in brand equity versus last year. In Q4, we continue to fuel our global brand momentum while strengthening our relevance in local markets.

We unveiled a number of unique collaborations. Examples of these include a premium collection with FarBor and a limited edition footwear launch with Nike and Japanese streetwear icon, Nego. We celebrated our final chapter of the reimagined campaign with Beyonce, and launched our global campaign targeted at men featuring Shabuzy, and Maddie Mathison. And we also reinforced our long-standing link to music culture by celebrating a full decade as an official sponsor of Corona Capital, Mexico's largest music festival. Putting the brand front and center in our second largest market. Moving to product. Our evolution into denim lifestyle is resonating, and the Levi's brand is gaining even more share of the closet as our tops business continues to accelerate.

The tops reset we initiated a few years ago, bringing in new internal talent, new vendors, and enhanced capabilities is paying off today. In Q4, tops grew double digits, driving nearly half of our revenue growth and meaningfully higher AURs versus last year. Strength was broad-based, reflecting growth across men's and women's which was driven by strong demand in our elevated assortment of sweaters, wovens, and outerwear. Tops will continue to be instrumental to our denim lifestyle strategy. And while we're pleased about our progress to date, we are just getting started as a destination for the tops category.

Within our bottoms business, we are showcasing our most diversified portfolio yet with everything from our core icon to our innovative fashion fits and non-denim bottoms, all delivering growth. While skinny and straight fits remain popular, loose and baggy styles continue to accelerate. New styles like the 578 baggy for him, and our expanding Barrel family for her are fueling momentum as we own more of the denim market in both his and her closet. In Q4, we successfully completed the global rollout of our blue tab collection, which represents the most premium expression of our brand.

While we are still in the early stages, the strong consumer response to this collection gives us conviction in the opportunity in the premium segment of the market, which is sizable and largely underpenetrated by the Levi's brand. In 2026, we will further expand the assortment and roll it out more broadly across our DTC business as well as select premium wholesale accounts. Looking to 2026, we enter the year with a robust product pipeline and a brand that's more culturally relevant than ever.

For the first time in more than twenty years, Levi's will debut its newest ad during the Super Bowl which will be hosted at Levi's Stadium, marking the launch of our new global campaign that will run through 2026. With this kickoff and more major global moments to come, including several World Cup Games To Be Held At Levi's Stadium this summer, we are energized by the runway ahead and confident in our ability to keep driving the Levi's brand forward. Now shifting to our next strategy to be DTC first. In Q4, our global direct-to-consumer business delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, up 10%, and posted its fifteenth consecutive quarter of positive comps.

We generated another quarter of high single-digit comp growth, reflecting positive performance across all store KPIs, including traffic, conversion, and UPT. In addition to AUR growth across every segment. In Q4, we opened 47 net new system stores, including mainline locations in Japan, India, Thailand, and Korea, as we continue to expand our DTC presence in Asia. Over the past year, we have transformed our retail operations both in stores and online, improving the consumer experience and store productivity. We've enhanced our in-store lifestyle merchandising, highlighting our broader assortment of head-to-toe looks. We've improved our assortment planning and life cycle management resulting in lower promotions and higher full-price selling.

And we're rolling out a new global selling model for our store team which will deliver operational efficiencies and improved consumer engagement. We are still in the early stages of what we believe is an opportunity to continue to improve our DTC margins, which will be a key driver of our overall company margins. Our efforts to build a strong digital foundation have enabled us to accelerate our e-commerce business. And in Q4, we delivered another quarter of very strong e-commerce growth up 22%. We are leveraging AI to make online shopping easier and more inspiring for our fans.

We recently launched Outfitting, an AI-powered feature in the Levi's app that creates style looks using our full assortment, purchasing behavior, and product imagery. This year, we'll evolve outfitting with even more consumer-centric customization, and we'll launch a new consumer-facing AI stylist chatbot that enables personalized recommendations through conversation. We are also continuing to scale the use of AI and advance analytics across the organization as we accelerate our shift to a best-in-class direct-to-consumer retailer. For example, we recently announced our plans to develop and deploy an integrated AgenTeq AI platform to simplify and automate task-driven work throughout the organization, driving efficiency, productivity, and enabling growth.

Built in partnership with Microsoft and as a frontier firm in the industry, we're currently testing this technology and plan to roll it out to employees this year. These initiatives are rewiring the company for a bold future, creating meaningful opportunities to enhance consumer experiences while unlocking additional operational efficiencies. While DTC continues to drive outsized growth, wholesale continues to be an important channel for us to amplify the brand and reach our consumers where they choose to shop. Our global wholesale business was flat for the quarter and ended the year up 4%. The channel has stabilized over the past year as our efforts to elevate the brand and broaden the assortment gain traction.

Now turning to our third strategy, powering the portfolio. In Q4, our international business grew 8% led by an acceleration in Europe and solid growth in Latin America. International comprises nearly 60% of total sales. And given the strength of the brand and our expansion into lifestyle, we see an immense opportunity for continued profitable growth outside the US. Beyond Yoga was up 45% in Q4, fueled by the positive response to our Seek Beyond campaign launched in Q3, and product expansion into new categories across active lifestyle. DTC performed particularly well and we opened four new stores in the quarter. Beyond Yoga ended the year up 17%.

And as we look to 2026, the brand will continue to expand its retail presence in new markets, and launch the next iteration of our broadened lifestyle assortment. Looking ahead, I am more confident than ever in our future potential. While we continue to navigate a dynamic global environment, we do so from a position of strength with an iconic brand, deep connection with our fans, and the agility to adapt and grow. Our strategies are working. And we have the right capabilities and team in place to continue to drive momentum in the year ahead.

We'll keep building our denim lifestyle leadership by bringing fans fresh new product across every category while continuing to celebrate the iconic styles that have shaped generations. And we'll continue to keep Levi's at the center of culture through a focus on sports, music, and youth, showing up powerfully on the world's biggest stages and sparking excitement that deepens our cultural relevance globally. All of this is supported by our continued commitment to drive operational excellence and to strengthen our execution grounded in a focus on discipline, accountability, and performance. I'd like to thank our incredible, talented, and passionate team for driving our transformation into the world's denim lifestyle leader and delivering outstanding service to our fans every day.

Together, we're building a stronger foundation for sustainable, long-term value creation. And with that, I will turn it over to Harmit to review our performance in the fourth quarter, the year, and expectations for 2026. Harmit?

Harmit Singh: Thank you, Michelle. 2025 was a strong year with continued consistent profitable growth for our company. I'm pleased that our growth has accelerated over the last three years and we have established ourselves as a consistent mid-single-digit growth company which we expect to continue in 2026. We've also made progress each year on expanding margins both gross and operating, while driving higher returns on invested capital ending the year at approximately 16%. Our 2025 financial results reflect the strength of our business and demonstrate that we have the right building blocks in place to drive long-term sustainable growth.

Our focus on denim lifestyle has enabled us to accelerate growth by expanding our total addressable market with our broadened assortment of non-denim bottoms, tops, dresses, and skirts which contributed to almost a third of our growth in 2025. Our disciplined approach to converting growth into profitability improved adjusted EBIT margin by 70 basis points in 2025. And we achieved this while navigating higher tariffs and investing in remapping our distribution network as we build the roadmap towards becoming a $10 billion DTC-first company. In 2026, we will continue to grow adjusted EBIT margins through our relentless focus on driving higher revenue flow through while making the right investments for our long-term growth.

Including growing our store base, AI capabilities, and marketing. In addition, we're making meaningful progress on mitigating tariff impacts on our P&L through targeted pricing actions, higher full-price selling, lower product cost, and prudent management of our cost base. Now let me walk you through the specifics of our fourth-quarter performance. Organic net revenues grew 5% and were up 13% on a two-year stack. Our outperformance was driven by better-than-expected results across channels and geographies. As we have seen throughout the year, both AURs and units contributed to our growth this quarter. We expect both price and unit growth to drive the top line in 2026 and beyond.

Gross margin for the quarter was 60.8% of net revenues, contracting 100 basis points relative to last year, in line with our expectations, primarily due to the impacts of tariffs which were partially offset by pricing actions and higher full-price selling. In the first quarter, we implemented additional pricing actions to further mitigate tariffs and while it's early, we are not seeing any impact on consumer demand thus far. Adjusted SG&A dollars grew 2.6% due to the sales upside driving higher selling and incentive expenses, higher costs associated with the transition of our US distribution network, and unfavorable foreign exchange. A brief update on our distribution network transformation in the US.

While we're making progress, the transition to the new third-party distribution center has taken longer than we expected. We've been working to fulfill our high demand, by continuing to operate our own distribution center which has led to higher transitory distribution costs, which we expect to continue to incur through '26. We successfully executed a distribution transition from owned and operated to a hybrid model in Europe last year, enabling us to fulfill our strong demand as evidenced by the double-digit revenue growth in the quarter, while improving our profitability in the region. This gives us confidence that we will successfully complete the transition in the US this year.

Moving down to the EBIT line, adjusted EBIT margin contracted 180 basis points to 12.1% related to the impact of lapping the fifty-third week and tariffs. This was slightly lower than our expectations due to the three reasons I mentioned before within SG&A. That is unfavorable effects, higher distribution cost, and incentive compensation. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was 41¢ higher than expectation. This includes a 3¢ headwind from a higher tax rate. We ended the year with reported inventory dollars up 9% to prior year and units up 2%. The year-over-year dollar increase was primarily driven by tariffs.

We continue to believe our inventory, quantity, and quality are well positioned globally and expect inventory levels ending fiscal '26 to be below revenue growth. Turning to dividend and share repurchases. In quarter four, we returned $55 million to shareholders and for the full year, we returned $363 million up 26% versus prior year. This included a 7% increase in the dividend versus last year. And the $150 million share buyback in '25 was the highest annual buyback since the IPO. And today, we're announcing a $200 million ASAP program which will be completed within three months but no later than six months, reflecting our confidence in our future and continued efforts to drive shareholder value.

Now let's review the key highlights by segment for the quarter. The Americas net revenues were up 2%. Our US DTC business grew 6% driven by strength in both brick and mortar and e-commerce. US wholesale was down, due to capacity constraints in our new 3PL as well as strong growth from a key digital wholesale customer in the prior year. Our LATAM business was up 8%, fueled by growth across most markets. And continued strength in DTC. Operating margins, which were up for the year, contracted 460 basis points in the quarter primarily due to the lapping of the fifty-third week and the impact of the tariffs.

Europe net revenues accelerated up 10% in Q4, led by double-digit growth in our largest European markets, the UK and Germany. We delivered strong holiday performance and growth across all categories, including men's, women's, tops, and bottoms. Gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage resulted in operating margin growing 330 basis points versus prior year. Europe's operating margin for the full year grew 180 basis points. Asia net revenues grew 4% year over year, fueled by strong DTC performance. Key markets, including Japan and Turkey, delivered double-digit growth this quarter as a head-to-toe lifestyle offerings continue to resonate with consumers and drive growth. Operating margin expanded 140 basis points versus prior year, driven by gross margin strength.

For the full year, Asia grew 7% and operating margin expanded 60 basis points. Now let's turn to outlook for fiscal '26 and Q1. We are pleased with our Q4 results and with our trends in the first quarter, including a successful holiday period. Looking to '26, we expect organic net revenue growth of four to 5% with one point favorability from foreign exchange resulting in reported net revenue growth of five to 6%. By segment, we expect the Americas to grow low single digits, Europe mid-single digits, and Asia mid to high single digits.

By channel, we expect DTC to grow high single digit fueled by positive comp sales, opening 50 to 60 net new system dose and continued growth in e-commerce. Global wholesale is expected to be flat to slightly up given plans to rationalize our wholesale footprint particularly a few nonstrategic accounts in the US, in support of our brand elevation strategy. Gross margin is expected to be flat to prior year. This includes an approximate 150 basis points gross impact from tariffs which we plan to offset with pricing actions, higher food price selling, product cost reduction, driven by lower cotton rates, and vendor negotiations. SQ rationalization and favorable mix.

FX is expected to be a 20 basis point headwind to gross margin. While these mitigation factors will begin to flow through the P&L early in the year, we anticipate the pace of benefit realization will accelerate as we progress through 2026 with a more meaningful contribution emerging in the later part of the year. The fundamental drivers of our gross margin expansion, which are mix higher full price selling, continued product cost reduction, remain intact. Positioning us well for resume full year expansion in 2027. We expect our fully adjusted SG&A rate to improve by approximately 40 to 60 basis points as the organization is increasingly focused on driving operating leverage.

This is driven by cost actions to mitigate tariffs, expansion of our global talent hubs, limited headcount increases as we drive productivity, and efficiencies by expanding AI usage and easing costs from running parallel distribution centers in the second half of the year. For the year, we expect marketing spend to be approximately 7% of total revenues flat to $20.25. As a result, adjusted EBIT margin is expected to expand 40 to 60 basis points in the range of 11.8 to 12%. Given our mid-single-digit growth, and our focus on growing gross profit dollars ahead, of SG&A dollars we do expect to leverage for the full year.

We expect the full year tax rate to be around twenty-three percent two points higher than twenty-five. And interest expense is expected to be approximately $12 million a quarter. Full year adjusted diluted EPS is expected to grow and be in the range of $1.40 to $1.46. This includes a 4¢ headwind from a higher tax rate and a 20¢ drag from the higher gross impact from tariffs which we are fully mitigating. CapEx should be approximately $230 million, 3.5% to 4% of revenues. Primarily to support store openings, fleet improvements, and our digital investment. Before I discuss our Q1 guidance, I wanted to give some color on the cadence of the P&L for the year.

We expect consistent mid-single-digit revenue growth throughout the year with Q2 slightly lower due to seasonality. We expect gross margin to improve in the second half as we realize the benefit of pricing and lap the impact of tariffs. On a full-year basis, as previously mentioned, we expect marketing spend to be 7% of total revenue. However, this spend will be Q1 weighted given the timing of a global marketing campaign which kicks off in February with the Super Bowl. Because of this, we expect Q1 spend to be approximately a 160 basis points than Q1 twenty-five and lower in the remaining three quarters of the year.

As a result of the Q1 marketing phasing, operating margin is expected to contract versus prior year in Q1 'twenty-six, and then expand as gross margin expansion and operating cost leverage take hold driving full-year growth. Now turning to the 2026. We expect organic net revenue growth of 4% to 5% consistent with our full-year forecast. And a three-point FX tailwind resulting in seven to 8% reported net revenue. On a two-year basis, this is an acceleration from Q4 twenty-five. And demonstrates that we are maintaining momentum. Gross margin is expected to be slightly down versus Q1 twenty-five, primarily due to the continued impacts of tariffs.

As noted earlier, we have already implemented pricing actions earlier this month and additional pricing actions will occur in February. Adjusted EBIT margin is expected to be down 140 basis points versus Q1 twenty-five to 12% primarily driven by the timing of the marketing campaign. While the production costs and expense in the first quarter we expect to benefit from the campaign through the course of the year. Excluding A&P timing, adjusted EBIT margin leverages and in Q1, we expect adjusted diluted EPS in Q1. be between 35 to 38¢. This includes a 7¢ drag for from A&P. In closing.

2025 was another solid year for us while accelerating top line and bottom line, evidencing the success of our strategies and our transformation to a denim lifestyle DTC first company. We entered '26 with strong momentum. And a maniacal focus on expanding operating margin. With a robust product pipeline, growing TAM, and clear plans to mitigate tariffs along with a talented and experienced management team will look forward to another year of consistent growth and margin expansion. Beyond '26, we are confident about what's ahead. Iconic brand, global reach, and relentless focus in growth and cost management will continue to create lasting shareholder value well beyond 2026. And with that, Latif, let's open up the line for Q&A.

Operator: Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. Please press star then the numbers 11 on your telephone keypad. Due to time constraints, the company requests that you ask only one question. If you have an additional question, please queue up again. If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself from the queue by Our first question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu of BNP Paribas. Your line is open, Laurent.

Laurent Vasilescu: Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I'd love to ask about gross margins. Harmit, you've historically beaten your initial gross margin guide. Are you taking the same conservative stance as in prior years with this guide of flat gross margins? How should we I think you talked about sequential improvement on the gross margin for the year, but can you maybe just put a finer point how do we think about the first quarter gross margin? I think expectations were a little bit higher for 4Q. And can you maybe just unpack a little bit more the drivers on Cotton Transit and the offset on tariffs for the bridge for the year.

Thank you very much, Harmit.

Harmit Singh: Thanks, Laurent. I was it's a gross margin question for you is right on the money. But let's start with a little bit of history. Gross margin, you know, we have established a track record of consistent gross margin expansion as you said. Our algorithm talks about expanding gross margin regularly. Every year. Last year, '25 we grew gross margins a 110 basis points. And over the past three years, it's grown about a 400 basis points. And I'll talk a little bit about the structural drivers, which are intact. Talking about '26, our guidance is at this time, flat to prior. What we have done nicely is offset the full impact of tariffs. You know, as the year progresses.

So tariffs, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, impacts gross margins adversely by about a 150 basis points. And we have an FX headwind of about 20. We're fully offsetting this with higher pricing, you know, most of it's been implemented. We have we're not seeing any initial demand reaction to it. So the last thing is pretty good. More full-price selling, which is something that we've been focusing now for about twelve to eighteen months. Especially as a product, you know, newness is resonating well with the consumer. And then lower product cost.

Which is a combination of lower you know, better and lower cotton, as well as queues the negotiation with the vendors as we rationalize you know, reduce unproductive you know, assortment, etcetera, etcetera. So the only thing I would say is the structural benefits, which is growing you know, more aggressively things like women's, is higher gross margin than men's. DTC, which is high gross margin in wholesale. And international, which is high gross margin than US. That's intact. So as we think about twenty-six, I think the way we flow this is first quarter will be slightly down than a year ago.

Because the pricing gets effectuated and improves and accelerates in terms of year-over-year performance as the year progresses, and we start lapping tariffs. And as we think about '27, Laurent, you know, our view is, you know, this is we don't guide '27 right now, but our view is the structural aspects that we're focused on growing which is through mix, which is DTC, women's, and international will resume the acceleration of gross margin in the years to come. So that's how we're thinking of gross margins you know, and I hope that answers your quest.

Laurent Vasilescu: It does. Thank you very much, and best of luck.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Your line is open, Matthew.

Matthew Boss: Thanks, and congrats on another nice quarter.

Harmit Singh: Thanks, Matt. So Michelle, how does your mid-single-digit organic outlook for this year size up to the denim category? Maybe where do you see opportunity to increasingly move to offense this year? And then Harmit, on that topic, you elaborate on the acceleration to 7% organic growth in November and December? Think that's on top of 8% growth a year ago, so a mid-teens two-year stack. Just could you speak to the strength that you're seeing? And have you seen any softening in top-line momentum post-holiday?

Michelle Gass: Okay. Great. Matt, I'll yeah. I'll start with your first one. We feel really good heading into 2026. I mean, I'd say it's clear that our strategies are working, and just as '25 was a strong year, plus 7% organic growth, we're expecting 2026, as you said, mid-single-digit. Four to five organic, five to six on a reported set basis. You know, highlights from my standpoint are number one, you know, I'd say that we are in the best shape that we've been in decades. Both operationally and financially. '25 is certainly a good proof point of that. Our strategies of being brand-led, DTC first, empowering the portfolio are clearly working, and they're driving broad-based growth across channels, categories, genders.

And I think what's really exciting is we're making this big transformation, as you know, from a denim bottoms business to a true head-to-toe denim lifestyle company. So when you think about four to 5% mid-single-digit growth ahead, you know, we do expect Matt to outperform the category. I mean, the category, and as you're talking just denim, it is accelerating globally. And as a leader, we are fueling that growth. You know, on that note, in the US, which is also growing we have cemented our position as the number one share for men's women, and youth. And it's the first time that we can remember that all three of these targets have grown share and are number one.

So it gives us tremendous confidence that strategies aren't changing. We're leaning in and we're executing. And the last point I would make is you know, just as we plan to continue to fuel the denim category, we've expanded our total addressable market. Right? We're no longer just in denim bottoms and in fact, as Harmit mentioned earlier, about a third of our growth this past year was driven by categories outside of denim bottoms. So speaking to top, which had a really fantastic year of double-digit, we expect that tailwind to continue. Non-denim, again, it's growing fast. We expect that to continue. And then, of course, we think about the women's business, women's had a great year, up 11%.

But that head-to-toe dressing from, yes, being relevant in fashion and loose, baggy, all the icons, but then also in skirts and dresses. Tops. So there's a lot of runway as we look into 2026 and beyond.

Harmit Singh: And your second question, Matt, I think, you know, holiday was strong for us. It centered around two strategies. One is DTC. So as you become a DTC-first company, as a team, we're really focused on making sure we win in holiday. We made sure you know, there's newness on the flow, we made sure the product that, you know, is you know, being innovative was both with our wholesale customers as well as in our stores and on e-commerce platform. Then the team's really executed really well. So that's, fact number one. Fact number two is just building on the standpoint that Michelle talked about. That's centered around the denim lifestyle. You know, focus.

The myth I would like to bust you know, is that we are we're just not only denim bottoms. We are more than denim bottoms. I mean, this is more of a head-to-toe lifestyle denim-focused company. So think about the outerwear. Our teams shout out to our product teams and merchants, product team led by Karen Hellman and lead merchants. We sold a lot of sweaters. You know, more than we have sold in a long time. You know, we sold a lot of chinos. So I can go and just talk about the different products that were introduced in holiday that really helped.

So that's what gives us the confidence that we can grow Q1 and a two-year stack at 14%. You talked about November and December at 15, but, you know, for the quarter, you know, that gives us the confidence. And sustaining the 7% organic growth with you know, four or five organic growth in 2026.

Matthew Boss: It's a great color. Best of luck. Thank you.

Harmit Singh: Thank you.

Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole of UBS. Your line is open, Jay.

Jay Sole: Thank you. You know, Michelle, in the prepared remarks, you made a comment that you believe that the direct-to-consumer channel margins can move higher. Can you just dive into that a little bit and tell us what are the drivers and where do you think the margin can go from where they are today?

Michelle Gass: Yeah. Absolutely. Thanks, Jay, for the question. We believe that there's a lot of upside in DTC from a revenue standpoint and margin. You know, as I commented earlier, 15 quarters of positive comp growth. So first of all, margin growth will come from leverage, you know, call it sales productivity. As we continue to drive higher volumes, we'll clearly leverage off of the fixed costs in our store, which includes, you know, your real estate, your fixed labor, just a lot of, you know, a lot of those, like I said, fixed costs. Secondly, I would say is, you know, we are really focused on retail excellence.

That had a big impact in expanding our store margins this past year, and that will continue. So we're stepping up our operations capabilities. That includes things like enhanced lifestyle merchandising. So when the consumer is coming in, they're not just buying a pair of bottoms, they're also buying the top. So driving UPTs, driving average ticket price, etc. Improved assortment planning and life management. You know, we talk about rewiring this company to be a retailer and that's happening. We put new systems in place. We're in the midst of rolling out a new planning allocation system that's gonna benefit sell-through. Keeping us in stock.

So and I would say historically, you know, that wasn't a core strength growing up as a wholesale company. That wasn't a core strength of ours. It has to be now. And you see it in the numbers to date. You'll see it going forward. And then lastly, would say, again, operating with a retail merchant mindset, is the selling model, and we have a new global selling model that's rolling out worldwide. So, you know, our expectation, the margin expansion that we saw this past year, we expect that to continue. We feel really good.

Jay Sole: Got it. Okay. Thank you so much.

Michelle Gass: Thanks, Jay.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Durbel of BTIG. Please go ahead, Bob.

Bob Durbel: Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on a nice quarter. I guess, was wondering if you could focus in on Europe a little bit more. Either country trends or the blue tab business have a big impact and those results over there? Looks pretty good. Thanks.

Harmit Singh: Thanks, Bob. So first, a big shout out to the Europe team. You know, they had a phenomenal year. They were up in the mid-single digit. The strength in Europe for the quarter was up 10%. End of the year really strong. And entering '26 with momentum. The strength was you know, evident. I talked about UK and Germany, my remarks being up double digit. But you think about the channels, both channels are up wholesale actually led the way with 13% growth. Growth and you look at the other markets, Bob, most markets grew in Europe again, very strong holiday. The team in Europe does a great job executing against the strategies. You know, women's was up 10.

Men's was up nine. As an example. And then e-commerce was up, you know, in a big time. So overall, really strong results. It translated you know, driving growth is one thing, but it's important as the growth translates to profitability, and it translated with operating margins up 380 basis points. So let's think forward. 26 with you know, we are signaling Europe growth mid-single digit. And you think of the prebook, which is the first sign of you know, how the wholesale customer will shop. Our prebook is up mid-single digit. So I think that's just, you know, just thinking about Europe for '26 and, you know, what drove 25.

Bob Durbel: Great. Thank you.

Michelle Gass: Thanks, Bob. Okay. And on BluTab, do you wanna take a question? No. Happy to talk. So Blue tab is clearly a global opportunity for us. So yes, in Europe, but across the globe. And we're really excited about this because we think this presents a new business for us. The premium category is largely untapped for us. It's sizable. It's growing, and we're significantly underpenetrated. So early signs for BluTab are very positive. We just rolled it out early in 2025, and it is the pinnacle expression of our brand. Very elevated, you know, commanding price points for bottoms for $200 to $350. Truckers, $250 to $400 the list goes on.

And we're early in the early stages, we're testing, we're learning, we're scaling, but it is showing that the consumer is responding and that we have permission to play in this elevated premium market. And, you know, we have we've also had green shoots through the collaborations that we've done for a long time, which have commanded those really elevated price points. But now we're really going to lean in. It isn't going to be you know, these in and out collaborations. We see it as an ongoing business, that not only will represent a commercial opportunity, but it's a great halo to the entire line.

So I think more to come, but you know, we're bullish on really getting into this premium category.

Bob Durbel: Good luck. Thank you, Michelle.

Michelle Gass: Thanks, Bob.

Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen of TD Cohen. Please go ahead, Oliver.

Gabriela Gar: Hi. This is Gabriela Gar on for Oliver. Thanks for taking our question. We think to hear a little bit more about any improvements that you're seeing within supply chain and progress that you're making on shortening go to market within your products I know you mentioned AI being an efficiency driver within the corporate setting, but would love to hear any additional color on supply chain. Thank you.

Michelle Gass: Why don't why don't Harmit and I both take this one? Let me talk about kind of end-to-end chain as it relates to product development. And I think Harmit can speak to our distribution transformation. So, as you know, we've been on this journey as we pivot to become a DTC retailer to shorten our timelines, drive global consistency, etcetera, and we're making good progress. We've taken a few months out of our end-to-end lead time, so we've shortened that. From, you know, what was sixteen, seventeen months down to fourteen months. We're now focused on creating different tracks of products.

So for example, in tops, we're going after shorter cycle times, looking at vendors who are closer to the point of distribution, etcetera. We have a new head of supply chain, Chris Caliari, who comes with deep experience in vertical retail and has a very, you know, very strong strategy to go after those opportunities. So that's point number one. Point number two, a key enabler to that is driving greater global consistency. So what used to be we've always developed our products here in San Francisco, but it was more kind of a bottoms-up approach. Now what we've seen is really more of a top I'll say tops down, but having a globally directed line.

For perspective, back in like twenty-three early twenty-four, our globally directed line was about 20%, we're now 50%. On our way to 70%. And with that, it clearly drives a lot of efficiency. So over time you'll see that show up in, you know, an inventory turn and sell-through and productivity, and also it allows us to really get behind those big bets from a marketing standpoint and leverage our resources. So the second and then the third piece somewhat related is we continue to be really focused on reducing our SKU count. And we are we are still ranging in the reduction of about 20%, 25%. Again, all of these things will help enable margin accretion over time.

Harmit Singh: Yeah. And on the Gabriela, to the question on distribution, just by context, you know, two years ago, we began remapping both US and distribution network. To a more hybrid automated omnichannel model largely done with the intent to support our long-term growth. And ensure we meet growing consumer demand. Europe, as I mentioned in my script, is fully transitioned, and we're seeing clear top line and bottom line opportunities. In the US, the ramp-up has taken a little longer than we expected.

And so we supplemented this by ensuring that one of our own facilities stayed open a little longer, as well as increase the manual operation because to be honest, the demand outstripped our expectations given the wonderful product that we have and, you know, we have introduced in the marketplace. We brought in distribution experts into our organization. Helping us complete the transformation. We're working with our third-party leading logistic partners, you know, and so we're confident of completing this by the end of the year. And as you saw from the Europe numbers, you know, when it is complete, it does make a big difference to top line and bottom line.

Gabriela Gar: Thank you. Thank you, both.

Operator: Thank you. Rick Patel of Raymond James. Your question, please, Rick.

Rick Patel: Thank you. Good afternoon, and congrats on wrapping up a strong year. Related to the new DC. So we wanted to double click on the delays you provide additional color there? And what gives you confidence it will come online in the back half? And then as we think about the SG&A impact, what's the right way to think about the impact that DC will have as we think about the transitory cost in the first half versus what should be a sizable opportunity to drive leverage from efficiency in the back half?

Harmit Singh: Yeah, sure. Thanks for asking the What gives us confidence is a couple of things. One, we've got a great team on our side and a great team with our third-party logistic partners. Working together to try and solve it and do it in a way that we are able to meet consumer demand while setting ourselves for the long term. So that's fact number one. Fact number two is you know, I mean, this is a daily, if not a weekly, discussion. And Michelle and I and the top teams, you know, management teams on the other side are directly in conversation. And the other only proof point I would have there is we've seen it happen in Europe.

There's no reason why it shouldn't happen. In the US. So that's addressing your question to the question on SG&A. Know, our focus on SG&A has risen to an all-time high within the company. I think you can ask the entire management team in the company, they'll say, this is a group that really wants to drive more leverage. And the best way to explain this Rick, is to say, let's convert a higher percentage of our growth, our gross profit dollars into EBIT dollar. You know, what gives us confidence in 2026 is a few things. One, you know, a higher volume, four to 5% organic or five to 6% reported. Should leverage.

Second is, I think, Jay, you asked the question about DTC product. Productivity. You know, again, a mid to bust, higher DTC doesn't mean lower EBIT margin. So you think about last year, our DTC margins were up 300 basis points. So EBIT margins were up. We've got plans to grow DTC margins even in 2020. In 2026. The other thing is have limited headcount increases. And the way we're doing it so that we manage growth with resources is really leverage the user AI and we've got global talent hub. Which is centered around the world across all functions. Where we're leveraging talent. And that should help us you know, offset some of the cost increases.

And your question about distribution cost we feel the parallel running of the DC that pressure eases by the first half of the year. So you start seeing some of the benefit in the second half of the year, and you see that in the P&L. And overall, our SG&A rate as a percentage of revenue, which we have always said will be around 50%, we think in '26 will be lower than that.

Rick Patel: Very helpful. Thank you.

Harmit Singh: Thanks.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tracy Kogan of Citi. Your question, Tracy.

Paul Lejuez: Hey. It's actually Paul Lejuez from Citi. Hey, Paul. You mentioned you mentioned several rounds of price increases I was wondering if you could just talk about where those are happening and the magnitude and maybe tie that into your assumptions for growth by geography in F twenty-six as you think about the breakdown between price versus units in each of the three geographies you mentioned?

Michelle Gass: Sure. Paul, I'll take that one. So, yeah, as we talked about earlier, we are taking, call it, thoughtful, targeted pricing actions. As part of our tariff mitigation. And that's largely happening in the US, although as ordinary course of business, we do take pricing around the world as we mitigate things like inflation and the like. But, you know, our focus for the most part was here in the US. I will say we have not seen any consumer or customer reaction to date, which I think is a testament to the strength of the business and the momentum we have and the consumer responding to our product or marketing efforts.

And I would say that we have pricing power given how strong the brand is right now, the market share gain, so, you know, where it's appropriate, especially in our higher tiered and newness innovation, we're leveraging that pricing power. While at the same time taking more modest pricing and being very diligent on, call it, those tier three lower priced entry-level prices. So the teams, you know, we have more data and more sophisticated models than we've ever had leveraging AI as a matter of fact. Informed by market analyses, demand elasticity, and, like I said, being very targeted on how we took that pricing. We took some last year fairly modestly.

We have more and that was mostly from a to the to our customers. Now from a consumer-facing standpoint, we do have pricing going in. Both in DTC and in wholesale in February. We'll be staying really close, but again, we have confidence as we head into 2026. And to your point on AUR versus units, we're expecting like we saw this last year, we're expecting both to grow in the coming year.

Paul Lejuez: And so is there is there any difference by geography in terms of the AUR versus units? Would imagine with the US, price increases or don't.

Harmit Singh: We don't necessarily guide at that level by geography, but the fact that we're expanding TAM and we're really focused on driving higher units per transaction. Which means that know, we are saying, you come in to buy a denim bottom or non-denim bottom there is now a great top available for you. That should drive units. Around the world.

Paul Lejuez: Thanks, guys. Good luck.

Harmit Singh: Thanks, guys.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, Brooke.

Brooke Roach: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Harmit, Michelle, I was hoping we could drill down a little bit deeper into your growth assumptions for the Americas business in 2026. It sounds like you have some strong momentum in DTC. You're taking a little bit of price. You sound pretty positive on units. But the growth would suggest that things are a little bit more challenged there. I think you mentioned that US wholesale is going to go through a bit of a rationalization this year. Can you help us understand what's happening there? And where the opportunity for upside is in your Americas business this year? Thank you.

Harmit Singh: Sure. So, Brooke, overall, the US grew the you know, in '25 by 4%. DTC, you know, was the standout. You know, growing 6%. But wholesale also grew you know, in the year. I think in the quarter, the, you know, US was flat. That is largely driven by, you know, as I mentioned in the call, two factors. One was we were lapping you know, a high sale in '24 from a large digital customer that was just timing. And the capacity constraints on the DC. And if you if you, you know, exclude that, or you, you know, adjust for the impact of that, in the quarter, US and US wholesale would have been uploaded mid-single digits.

So US has had a great year. To your question about next year, you know, our expectation is the US grows low to mid-single digit. Wholesale globally, our view is, you know, flat to slightly up. That's largely driven by the rationalization of some nonstrategic accounts in the US. I mean, you know, as we you know, focus on elevating the brand, and, you know, taking this business to the next level. Our view on wholesale is that it's an important channel for us, in fact, key channel allows us to reach a lot of fans. And, you know, the broader assortment that Michelle referred to in her prepared remarks.

Etcetera, as a resonate with the consumer and DTC, we're able to take to wholesale. And I think that should drive growth over time.

Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Nikic of Needham. Your line is open, Tom.

Tom Nikic: Hi. Hey, everyone. Thanks, John. Want to follow-up on Brooke's question there. Recognizing that there's the headwinds from some of the wholesale rationalization in the US, I'm just wondering what the business looks like in your strategic wholesale accounts in the US, how have sell-through rates been, you know, how will the order book shaking out, you know, etcetera, just, you know, what does it look like among the strategic accounts in the US?

Michelle Gass: You bet. Tom, I'll take that one. Thanks for the question. First, I think it's important to reiterate that we believe in the wholesale channel. You know, this is really an and story versus an or. Yes, DTC, we expect to continue to outperform, but over the long term, we expect wholesale to be slightly positive over time. You know, we've guided about flat for next year, and I think we're guiding that despite the fact. That we are rationalizing in some nonstrategic accounts, things like, I would say, the grocery channel that we're we show up in today in the US.

So I think it's a good thing for the brand and again we're driving to flat even despite some of these account decisions. As it relates to our core strategics, I think the partnership are really strong. These accounts are embracing denim lifestyle. Tops, men's and women's, I mean really Levi's getting into the top category. In wholesale in a meaningful way is a new step forward for us. Women's accounts have really embraced our women's strategy and you'll see that in key accounts where they've expanded the footprint. In some cases, we've expanded doors. And then this head-to-toe denim lifestyle getting into new categories like skirts, dresses, etc.

So we really do see it as a compliment, and I think one of the really great things is that in DTC, we can launch products first and they get to see the results and then we can take them to wholesale. And we've seen that model play out. One of our big hits of the year was the Cinch Baggy and that took off both in DTC and in wholesale. As we look ahead, you know, around the world, for example, you know, we had positive growth in Europe even in the quarter. We the order books are positive for next year. Latin America, again, for the quarter.

So net, I think it's a really good story as we've expanded our addressable market to expand these categories. And let's not forget, even in Q4, from a total business standpoint, grew market share in men's, women's, that youth target. I'll wrap it up by saying, you know, we're bullish across all channels and there's so much opportunity for Levi's in our core denim bottoms business and head-to-toe lifestyle.

Tom Nikic: Great to hear. Thanks very much, Michelle, and best of luck this year.

Michelle Gass: Thank you.

What does that suggest about the strength of China's, you know, homegrown domestic AI chip chip companies right now?
Um, not everybody thinks we should be selling uh AI chips to to China.","We did get news and you are in fact chip just the guy to talk about this with.

So the journal reporting, okay, China has approved purchases of Nvidia's popular H200 AI chips for the first time.

Uh, Alibaba, bytedance, they received the initial batch of approvals.

You saw that headline, Chris, you saw that report. What what do you make of it?

Well, I think it's not a surprise that China wants some volume of these chips. They're more capable than Chinese chips that can be produced at home and they're available in much larger

uh quantities. So the leading Chinese firms really need these chips to deploy their AI systems at scale.

But I think at the same time, China is dead set on trying to become self-sufficient or at least as close to self-sufficient as it can when it comes to AI chips.

And so the Chinese government's going to keep pursuing its efforts to build up its own uh chip ecosystem to try to wean itself off reliance on foreign and especially American chip suppliers.

What what does Chris that the sort of green lighting here? What does that signal? What does that suggest about the strength of China's, you know, homegrown domestic AI chip chip companies right now?

Well, I think any uh objective estimate shows that they're far behind, especially in the quantity of chips that they can actually produce.

The best estimates we have are that the US plus partners in Taiwan, Korea are going to produce something like 30 times the number of AI chips uh as China will this year.

So that's a massive gap, especially given China's uh aspirations to be uh one of the two largest players in AI.

And so China needs these chips, they know it. Uh but they also uh know that in the long run they don't want to be reliant on foreign chips, which is why they're they are so focused on trying to improve their own domestic chip manufacturing ecosystem.

Even though I think it's going to be some time before they can rival the chip manufacturing capabilities of Taiwan.

You know, not everybody, Chris, as you know, thinks this is such a smart move, such a smart strategy. Um, not everybody thinks we should be selling uh AI chips to to China.

Anthropic CEO Dario Amoday, um, you saw this Chris recently, here was his take on this.

says it's a mistake, says, I think this is crazy, he says, says, it's a bit like selling nuclear weapons to North Korea.

What did you make of those comments?

Well, I I think it is true that chips will be used for and already are being used for defense and intelligence applications.

The United States does it, China does it, all the world's great powers do it.

I think the other aspect of the export control debate is, you know, which part of the technology stack do you want to support?

Obviously, if you restrict US firms' chip sales to China, it's bad for US chip firms, but if you enable the next generation of Chinese model firms or cloud computing firms, well that could be a challenge for Open AI or Microsoft or AWS.

And so the balance that we got to strike is to make sure that yes, you don't want to be too punitive against a chip firm, but you also don't want to be giving the capabilities that will enable Deepseek or Alibaba or bytedance to train their next generation of models and provide a tougher competition to US firms.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/u1nqECCulVmkaDEduW2B4A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/4efafcae-52f3-4b88-8491-ee37050efcd7,N,,2026-01-28 19:27:51.800560

Other companies that have taken job cuts recently 1.","NEW YORK (AP) — As layoffs pile up, workers are feeling increasingly anxious about the job market.

In the U.S., economists have said that businesses are largely at a “no-hire, no fire” standstill, leading many to limit new work, if not pause openings entirely amid economic uncertainty. Hiring has stagnated overall — with the country adding a meager 50,000 jobs last month, down from a revised figure of 56,000 in November.

But a growing list of companies are also cutting jobs. Employers have initiated layoffs across sectors — with many pointing to rising operational costs that span from President Donald Trump’s barrage of new tariffs, stubborn inflation and shifts in spending from consumers, whose outlook on the U.S. economy recently plummeted to its lowest level since 2014. At the same time, some businesses are reducing their workforces as they redirect money to artificial intelligence, often baked into wider corporate restructuring.

Beyond the private sector, thousands of federal government employees lost their jobs in cuts taken by the Trump administration last year — forcing many to look for new work. That’s further strained workers’ overall sentiment about finding stable employment today.

Here are a few companies that have announced some of the largest job cuts recently.

Amazon

E-commerce giant Amazon slashed about 16,000 corporate roles on Wednesday — just three months after laying off another 14,000 workers. In its latest round of layoffs, Amazon cited restructuring aimed at “removing bureaucracy” in its operations, but the cuts also arrive as the company continues to ramp up spending on AI. CEO Andy Jassy previously said that he anticipated generative AI to reduce Amazon’s corporate workforce.

UPS

On Tuesday, United Parcel Service said it plans to cut up to 30,000 operational jobs this year — notably as the package company continues to reduce the number of Amazon shipments it handles amid wider turnaround efforts. UPS said these cuts will be made through a voluntary buyout offer for full-time drivers and attrition. The reductions come on top of a combined 48,000 job cuts that the company disclosed in 2025.

Tyson Foods

Late last year, Tyson Foods said it would be closing a plant that employed 3,200 people in Lexington, Nebraska — bringing job losses for nearly a third of the small town’s population of 11,000. The layoffs began on Jan. 20, but the company notified state officials that it was temporarily retaining under 300 workers to help complete the closure. Tyson in November also announced plans to cut one of two shifts at an Amarillo, Texas plant, eliminating an additional 1,700 jobs.

HP

Also in November, HP said it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year.

Verizon

Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees in November. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and “reorient” the entire company.

Nestlé

In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years.

Novo Nordisk

In September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition.

Intel

Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs as the struggling chipmaker works to revive its business. Last year, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end 2025 with 75,000 “core” workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That’s down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of 2024. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction.

Procter & Gamble

Last summer, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company’s global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures.

Microsoft

Microsoft initiated two rounds of mass layoffs last year — first impacting 6,000 and then another 9,000 positions. The tech giant cited “organizational changes,” but the cuts also arrived as the company spends heavily on AI.

Other companies that have taken job cuts recently

1. General Motors cut about 1,700 jobs across manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio last fall, in addition to hundreds of temporary layoffs for other employees.

2. Skydance-owned Paramount initiated roughly 1,000 layoffs in October, and later announced plans to cut another 1,600 jobs as part of divestures in Argentina and Chile.

3. Target in October moved to eliminate about 1,800 corporate positions.

4. ConocoPhillips announced plans to lay off up to a quarter of its workforce, or between 2,600 and 3,250 workers, taking most of the cuts before the end of 2025.

5. Lufthansa Group says it will shed 4,000 jobs by 2030.

Levi Strauss Financial Performance Overview

By Neil J Kanatt

Impact of Tariffs on Revenue

Jan 28 (Reuters) - Levi Strauss beat Wall Street estimates for fourth‑quarter sales and profit on Wednesday, helped by growth in direct-to-consumer sales channels and a sharper focus on popular styles as the denim maker fights tariff-related challenges.

Sales Performance by Region

Shares of the company were up 2% in extended trading.

Future Earnings Outlook

The retailer sources most of its products from Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan, which face high U.S. tariffs. To soften the hit, it limited its holiday season selection to products most popular among Gen Z and younger millennials, raised prices modestly, secured holiday inventory early, and leaned heavily on direct‑to‑consumer channels that support sales at full price.

Levi expects an impact of about 150 basis points on annual gross margin, which it aims to fully mitigate.

""We'll fully offset the tariffs through pricing actions, most of which we have implemented in the U.S., (and) some overseas,"" CFO Harmit Singh told Reuters on Wednesday.

Higher full-price sales and lower product costs through vendor negotiations and operational efficiencies will also help minimize the hit, Singh added.

The company has exited lower‑margin businesses such as Denizen and Dockers in North America and introduced its premium Blue Tab line to tap higher‑income shoppers.

Quarterly net revenue rose 1% to $1.77 billion, topping estimates of $1.71 billion. Adjusted earnings of 41 cents per share also beat expectations, according to LSEG data.

However, revenues in the U.S. segment fell 7%, as inflation and economic uncertainty pressure consumer spending among low- and mid-income earners in the U.S.

""Weaker sales in the U.S. could point to falling demand as uncertainty dampens interest in discretionary purchases,"" eMarketer analyst Rachel Wolff said.

Revenue in Europe and Asia rose 8% and 2%, respectively, while overall DTC revenues increased 8%.

Levi expects annual adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.40 to $1.46, below analysts' average estimate of $1.48, hurt by a 4-cent hit from a higher tax rate.

The apparel maker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.41 for the fourth quarter, exceeding analyst estimates of $0.39.

Revenue came in at $1.8 billion, surpassing the consensus forecast of $1.71 billion and representing 1% reported growth and 5% organic growth compared to the same period last year. The company cited ""broad-based strength"" in its business, including high-single digit comparable sales in its direct-to-consumer channels.

""Over the past few years, we’ve taken bold steps toward becoming a DTC-first, head-to-toe denim lifestyle brand,"" said Michelle Gass, President and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. ""We have narrowed our focus, improved operational execution and built greater agility across the organization.""

Despite the strong quarterly performance, investors reacted negatively to the company’s fiscal 2026 earnings outlook. Levi forecasts earnings per share between $1.40 and $1.46 for the upcoming fiscal year, below the analyst consensus of $1.48. The company did note that its guidance includes expectations for mid-single digit revenue growth and adjusted EBIT margin expansion.

The results cap what management described as a strong fiscal 2025, which delivered ""accelerated revenue growth and margin expansion"" as the company continues its transformation toward a more direct-to-consumer business model focused on lifestyle offerings beyond its traditional jeans products.

SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE: LEVI) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended November 30, 2025.

“Over the past few years, we’ve taken bold steps toward becoming a DTC-first, head-to-toe denim lifestyle brand,” said Michelle Gass, President and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. “We have narrowed our focus, improved operational execution and built greater agility across the organization. As a result, we’ve elevated the Levi’s® brand and delivered faster growth and higher profitability, as reflected by our Q4 and full year 2025 results. While we still have important work ahead, the company is at an inflection point—emerging as a stronger, more resilient global business ready to define the next chapter of LS&Co.”

“We are sustaining our momentum, delivering 5% organic growth in the fourth quarter on top of an 8% increase in the prior year. Our success in denim lifestyle has enabled us to expand our addressable market, positioning us for mid-single digit growth in 2026 and beyond,” said Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer of Levi Strauss & Co. “Our disciplined approach to converting growth into profitability has improved adjusted EBIT margin in 2025 for the third year in a row, and we are on track to expand margins further as we strive toward 15%. Our confidence in this trajectory is reflected in a new $200 million ASR program.”

Operating margin was 11.9% in both Q4 2025 and Q4 2024. Adjusted EBIT margin was 12.1% compared to 13.9% last year primarily due to the impact of lapping the 53rd week and tariffs.

Fiscal 2026 Guidance

Guidance for 2026 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Guidance assumes U.S. tariffs on imports from China remain at 30% and Rest-of-World at 20%.

The following guidance is provided for the year ending November 29, 2026:

Reported net revenues growth: 5% to 6%

Organic net revenues growth: 4% to 5%

Gross margin: flat to prior year

Adjusted EBIT margin: expanding to 11.8% to 12%

Tax rate: approximately 23%, 2 points higher than prior year

Adjusted diluted EPS: $1.40 to $1.46. This includes an approximate $0.04 headwind from a higher tax rate.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, potential tariffs or currency fluctuations. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, potential tariffs, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management’s view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company’s core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-Currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions, divestitures or wind downs impacting the comparable reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. These measures exclude the results of our Dockers® business, which is classified as discontinued operations.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company’s operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company’s financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

“Over the past few years, we’ve taken bold steps toward becoming a DTC-first, head-to-toe denim lifestyle brand,” said Michelle Gass, President and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. “We have narrowed our focus, improved operational execution and built greater agility across the organization. As a result, we’ve elevated the Levi’s® brand and delivered faster growth and higher profitability, as reflected by our Q4 and full year 2025 results. While we still have important work ahead, the company is at an inflection point—emerging as a stronger, more resilient global business ready to define the next chapter of LS&Co.”

“We are sustaining our momentum, delivering 5% organic growth in the fourth quarter on top of an 8% increase in the prior year. Our success in denim lifestyle has enabled us to expand our addressable market, positioning us for mid-single digit growth in 2026 and beyond,” said Harmit Singh, Chief Financial and Growth Officer of Levi Strauss & Co. “Our disciplined approach to converting growth into profitability has improved adjusted EBIT margin in 2025 for the third year in a row, and we are on track to expand margins further as we strive toward 15%. Our confidence in this trajectory is reflected in a new $200 million ASR program.”

Operating margin was 11.9% in both Q4 2025 and Q4 2024. Adjusted EBIT margin was 12.1% compared to 13.9% last year primarily due to the impact of lapping the 53 rd week and tariffs.

Fiscal 2026 Guidance

Guidance for 2026 is based on continuing operations, reflecting the Dockers® business being reported in discontinued operations. Guidance assumes U.S. tariffs on imports from China remain at 30% and Rest-of-World at 20%.

The following guidance is provided for the year ending November 29, 2026:

Reported net revenues growth: 5% to 6%

Organic net revenues growth: 4% to 5%

Gross margin: flat to prior year

Adjusted EBIT margin: expanding to 11.8% to 12%

Tax rate: approximately 23%, 2 points higher than prior year

Adjusted diluted EPS: $1.40 to $1.46. This includes an approximate $0.04 headwind from a higher tax rate.

This outlook also assumes no significant worsening of macro-economic pressures on the consumer, inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, potential tariffs or currency fluctuations. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, potential tariffs, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The company reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital to provide investors with additional useful information about its financial performance, to enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and to allow for greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for financial and operating decision-making. The company presents these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing its financial performance from management's view and because it believes they provide an additional tool for investors to use in computing the company's core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in its industry. The tables found below present Adjusted SG&A, Adjusted SG&A margin, Adjusted EBIT (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBIT margin (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), Adjusted diluted earnings per share (both reported and on a constant-currency basis), organic net revenues, Adjusted free cash flow, and return on invested capital and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Certain items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities; (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP forward looking information to the corresponding GAAP measures cannot be provided without unreasonable efforts due to the challenge in quantifying various items including but not limited to, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, taxes, and any future restructuring, restructuring-related, severance and other charges.

Organic Net Revenues and Constant-Currency

The company reports net revenues in accordance with GAAP, as well as on an organic net revenues basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of our revenues which excludes the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates from the change in reported net revenues, net revenues derived from business acquisitions, divestitures or wind downs impacting the comparable reporting date and the estimated impact of any 53rd week. The company reports certain operating results in accordance with GAAP, as well as on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. These measures exclude the results of our Dockers® business, which is classified as discontinued operations.

The term foreign currency exchange rates refers to the exchange rates used to translate the company's operating results for all countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar into U.S. Dollars. Because the company is a global company, foreign currency exchange rates used for translation may have a significant effect on its reported results. In general, the company's financial results are affected positively by a weaker U.S. Dollar and are affected negatively by a stronger U.S. Dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which it conducts its business. References to operating results on a constant-currency basis mean operating results without the impact of foreign currency translation fluctuations.

The company calculates constant-currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign currency exchange rates for the current period. Constant-currency results do not eliminate the transaction currency impact, which primarily includes the realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized from the measurement and remeasurement of purchases and sales of products in a currency other than the functional currency and of forward foreign exchange contracts.

The company believes disclosure of organic net revenues and Adjusted EBIT constant-currency, Adjusted EBIT Margin constant-currency and Adjusted Net Income constant-currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of its results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates. However, organic net revenues and constant-currency results are non-GAAP financial measures and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP, are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should be read in conjunction with the company's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Organic net revenues and constant-currency results have limitations in their usefulness to investors and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be directly comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.

RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER AND FISCAL YEAR 2025

The following information relates to non-GAAP financial measures, and should be read in conjunction with the investor call held on January 28, 2026, discussing the company’s financial condition and results of operations as of and for the quarter and year ended November 30, 2025. Because the results of our Dockers® business are classified as discontinued operations, those results are not reflected in our non-GAAP measures.

We define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:

Adjusted SG&A:

The following table presents a reconciliation of SG&A, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted SG&A for each of the periods presented.

____________________

Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented.

____________________

Adjusted Net Income:

The following table presents a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted net income for each of the periods presented.

____________________

Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share:

The following table presents a reconciliation of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for each of the periods presented.

____________________

Adjusted Free Cash Flow:

Adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, includes net cash flow from operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is an important liquidity measure of the cash that is available after capital expenditures for operational expenses and investment in our business. We believe Adjusted free cash flow is useful to investors because it measures our ability to generate or use cash. Once our business needs and obligations are met, cash can be used to maintain a strong balance sheet, invest in future growth and return capital to stockholders.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow from operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted free cash flow for each of the periods presented.

Return on Invested Capital:

We define Return on invested capital (“ROIC”) as the trailing four quarters of Adjusted net income before interest and after taxes divided by the average trailing five quarters of total invested capital. We define total invested capital as total debt plus shareholders' equity less cash and short-term investments. We believe ROIC is useful to investors as it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business.

Our calculation of ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROIC using the non-GAAP metric Adjusted net income. Although ROIC is a standard financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROIC. As a result, the method we use to calculate our ROIC may differ from the methods used by other companies. This metric is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings measures defined by GAAP.

The table below sets forth the calculation of ROIC for each of the periods presented.

Transcript

We're going to front page. Opening Eye has launched Prism, a free cloud based workspace designed to help scientists write and collaborate on research using artificial intelligence as the company pushes deeper into tools for academic and scientific work. Open. I just deployed the patch. They took the quick set architecture, that cloud native Latex platform if you remember, which they had acquired without a lot of noise, and fused it with GPT 5.2. The model has root access to your project directory. It parses dot TX files. It maps the dependency tree of your arguments. So basically when you change a variable in equation 3, let's say, it flags that. Your conclusion in Section 5 is now mathematically invalid. It runs a diff. On your logic, the way a linter runs on your code, it handles the grunt work, citation formatting, bib text management. The context window holds the entire thesis, not just the abstract. The real disruption that we have seen is actually in the visual stack. So when you draw a system architecture, let's say on a white board, you snap a photograph of the same, drop it into the console. The multimodal engine generates the Tikz code, it renders A vector perfect. Diagram inside your document. Zero shot. So if you have course have ever wasted hours mapping coordinates in Tikz, you pretty much understand that the value proposition here becomes infinite. It adds multilayer latency comparable to Google Docs, but with version control, unlimited collaborators, real-time commits to the draft. So now of course, if you're thinking I don't have a PhD, I don't wear a lab coat, so why should I? OK, because the biggest secret about prison is that it's not just for scientists. And Open the Eye has admitted it. They are already seeing 8.4 million queries a week on hard science. If you are of course in undergrad and have a 20 page paper due on, let's say, the geopolitics of lithium. What you do is feed prism the rod PDFs and it will of course format the citations perfectly. Let us say you draw a terrible sketch on a napkin, pretty much like me. Don't worry, feed it to prism. It will turn your Sorry to say this again but your chicken scratch off a doodle into a vector perfect schematic. So I guess no need to learn SCAD. Just draw the box. If you are, let's say arguing on Reddit and trying to make. A credible point about, let's say, metabolic health without disappearing into the Google Scholar, that's exactly where PRISM makes a grand entry. PRISM basically goes into the literature, pulls the papers, synthesizes the findings, and figures out what actually holds up. And of course, what comes back from PRISM is the kind of argument usually built over years of academic work. But of course it is minus the timelines, the jargon. And most definitely minus the student debt. So what do we feel? Well here on front page, this is our thought. Open AI is giving us a GT 5.2 powered lab for free. They don't care so much about your subscription. No, what they actually want are your traces. They conquered code with GitHub. They conquered chat with ChatGPT. Prism is the wager they're putting up for reasoning data by hosting the process of science, the complicated iterative red line drafts. They are actually building the training set for the next model. They are capturing the chain of thought of the smartest people on earth to optimize their weights. The tool is steer, it deprecates the old stack and alongside that, the friction of course is gone. But please, let's not make any mistakes here because we are not just writing a paper, we are performing our LHF, which of course stands for reinforcement learning from human feedback on their infrastructure. So please make sure that when we use the tool and ship the discovery, we have our local backups intact. This, ladies and gentlemen, is front page by the AIM network and you know what to do. Yes, think a, I think a I am.

NVIDIA also intends to tap into Intel's EMIB technology for its chiplet interconnectivity, the report says.

The ""Feynman"" AI GPU will still be majorly TSMC-based, with its core IP being built on die(s) leveraging TSMC A16 (1.6 nm) foundry node, which is expected to make up 75% of the chip's value. The remaining silicon content will be built on Intel 18A or Intel 14A nodes, and the chip's final packaging is expected to take place in U.S. soil, at Intel Foundry. This way, it will be Intel handling the EMIB chiplet bonding. ""Feynman"" is expected to implement a newer memory standard, such as HBM4e or even HBM5, and significantly increase memory per package, so each chip can handle trillion-parameter scale models.

Many investors were likely scratching their heads, wondering what’s going on, especially when the company’s fundamentals seem so solid, buoyed by the incredible success of drugs like Mounjaro and Zepbound. But as it turns out, the reasons behind LLY’s recent downturn are a complex weave of what’s happening in the wider market, shifts within the pharmaceutical sector, and specific company news.

The Broader Market's Shadow

First off, let’s talk about the big picture. The stock market, as a whole, has been a bit of a rollercoaster lately. You’ve probably seen headlines about the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experiencing more ups and downs. A big part of this is due to those persistent inflation worries and the resulting rise in Treasury yields. When interest rates climb, it makes those safer, fixed-income investments look a lot more appealing. This often leads investors to pull back from high-growth stocks, particularly in sectors like healthcare and biotech, which have been favorites for a while. It’s a classic case of sector rotation, where money moves out of what’s been hot and into more defensive or value-oriented plays.

And Eli Lilly, with its impressive growth, has been trading at a premium. As of late 2024, its forward P/E ratio was well over 40. When the ‘risk-free’ return from bonds goes up, even fundamentally sound companies can find their valuations being squeezed. So, a sustained increase in the 10-year Treasury yield can definitely put pressure on stocks like LLY.

A Closer Look at Eli Lilly's Recent News

Digging into Eli Lilly’s own recent developments, the latest quarterly earnings report, which came out in late April 2024, was actually quite good. They beat earnings estimates and saw revenue jump 18% year-over-year, with tirzepatide-based therapies (Mounjaro and Zepbound) raking in over $3.5 billion. That’s impressive, right?

However, during the earnings call, management did offer a note of caution. While demand is soaring, they acknowledged the ongoing challenges in scaling up manufacturing to meet that demand. CEO David Ricks mentioned they were “working around the clock to scale manufacturing.” This isn’t necessarily bad news, but it does highlight a potential bottleneck that could temper near-term revenue growth. The company also slightly revised its full-year guidance, maintaining its outlook but emphasizing that supply chain improvements would be gradual. While not a downgrade, some analysts were hoping for a more optimistic forward-looking statement, and the absence of an upward revision might have disappointed.

As Sarah Chen, a Senior Biotech Analyst at Morningstar, put it, “Eli Lilly delivered another stellar quarter, but the market is pricing in perfection. Any hint of execution risk—even if temporary—can trigger a pullback.” It’s a good reminder that even the best companies face scrutiny.

Navigating the Competitive and Regulatory Seas

Beyond market forces and company-specifics, the competitive landscape is also heating up, particularly in the GLP-1 drug space. Eli Lilly’s main rival, Novo Nordisk, recently got FDA approval for Wegovy in adolescents, opening up a new patient group. Plus, there are whispers about Pfizer and Zealand Pharma making strides with oral GLP-1 candidates, which could eventually challenge the dominance of injectable therapies.

Eli Lilly is certainly working on its own next-generation treatments, including an oral version of tirzepatide, but the timeline for these is still a bit fuzzy. Any delays in clinical trials could chip away at their first-mover advantage. And then there’s the ever-present regulatory scrutiny. The FDA is signaling it might require more extensive, long-term cardiovascular studies for obesity drugs before approving broader uses. If new data requirements slow down approvals or hike up development costs, it could eventually impact profit margins.

What's Next for LLY?

Looking ahead, there are a few key events that investors will be watching closely. The FDA decision on Zepbound for cardiovascular risk reduction, expected in the third quarter of 2024, is a big one. We’ll also be keeping an eye on the Phase 3 results for orforglipron, their oral GLP-1 candidate, which should be out around mid-2025. Any announcements about expanding manufacturing capacity will also be crucial, as will updates on the early-stage research into tirzepatide for Alzheimer’s disease.

A Quick Look at the Charts

From a technical perspective, LLY has been consolidating after a pretty significant rally. It hit an all-time high around $900 in March 2024 and has since pulled back to the $800-$830 range – a correction of about 8-10%, which isn't too alarming for a growth stock. The recent dip saw a spike in trading volume, suggesting some institutional selling or profit-taking after those big gains. The RSI has moved from overbought territory into more neutral ground, indicating momentum has cooled but not that the stock is oversold. Interestingly, short interest remains quite low, suggesting this sell-off isn't being driven by a surge in bearish bets.

So, while the dip might be unsettling, it’s a confluence of factors – market sentiment, competitive pressures, and the inherent complexities of scaling up production for groundbreaking drugs – that are likely at play. For long-term investors, understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the inevitable fluctuations of the market.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-28 16:36:32.830266

In the U.S., economists have said that businesses are largely at a ""no-hire, no fire"" standstill, leading many to limit new work, if not pause openings entirely amid economic uncertainty. Hiring has stagnated overall — with the country adding a meager 50,000 jobs last month, down from a revised figure of 56,000 in November.

But a growing list of companies are also cutting jobs. Employers have initiated layoffs across sectors — with many pointing to rising operational costs that span from President Donald Trump's barrage of new tariffs, stubborn inflation and shifts in spending from consumers, whose outlook on the U.S. economy recently plummeted to its lowest level since 2014. At the same time, some businesses are reducing their workforces as they redirect money to artificial intelligence, often baked into wider corporate restructuring.

Beyond the private sector, thousands of federal government employees lost their jobs in cuts taken by the Trump administration last year — forcing many to look for new work. That's further strained workers' overall sentiment about finding stable employment today.

Here are a few companies that have announced some of the largest job cuts recently.

Amazon

E-commerce giant Amazon slashed about 16,000 corporate roles on Wednesday — just three months after laying off another 14,000 workers. In its latest round of layoffs, Amazon cited restructuring aimed at ""removing bureaucracy"" in its operations, but the cuts also arrive as the company continues to ramp up spending on AI. CEO Andy Jassy previously said that he anticipated generative AI to reduce Amazon's corporate workforce.

UPS

On Tuesday, United Parcel Service said it plans to cut up to 30,000 operational jobs this year — notably as the package company continues to reduce the number of Amazon shipments it handles amid wider turnaround efforts. UPS said these cuts will be made through a voluntary buyout offer for full-time drivers and attrition. The reductions come on top of a combined 48,000 job cuts that the company disclosed in 2025.

Tyson Foods

Late last year, Tyson Foods said it would be closing a plant that employed 3,200 people in Lexington, Nebraska — bringing job losses for nearly a third of the small town's population of 11,000. The layoffs began on Jan. 20, but the company notified state officials that it was temporarily retaining under 300 workers to help complete the closure. Tyson in November also announced plans to cut one of two shifts at an Amarillo, Texas plant, eliminating an additional 1,700 jobs.

HP

Also in November, HP said it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year.

Verizon

Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees in November. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and ""reorient"" the entire company.

Nestlé

In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years.

Novo Nordisk

In September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition.

Intel

Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs as the struggling chipmaker works to revive its business. Last year, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end 2025 with 75,000 ""core"" workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That's down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of 2024. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction.

Procter & Gamble

Last summer, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company's global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures.

Microsoft

Microsoft initiated two rounds of mass layoffs last year — first impacting 6,000 and then another 9,000 positions. The tech giant cited ""organizational changes,"" but the cuts also arrived as the company spends heavily on AI.

Corp.’s third-quarter fiscal 2026 results through the date of sale, as the transaction did not qualify for discontinued-operations treatment.","V.F. Corporation VFC reported third-quarter fiscal 2026 results, with a sales and earnings beat. While earnings fell year over year, revenues increased. Nevertheless, the company is on track with its Reinvent program and expects to deliver medium-term financial targets. The Reinvent program and VFC’s actions to boost operating profitability appear encouraging.

The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 58 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Earnings declined from 62 cents a share in the year-earlier quarter.

V.F. Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise

V.F. Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | V.F. Corporation Quote

Net revenues of $2.88 billion grew 1% year over year and surpassed the consensus estimate of $2.76 billion. Adjusted revenues (excluding Dickies) increased 4% year over year. The adjusted gross margin rose 10 bps to 57%.

V.F. Corp. reported solid third-quarter performance, delivering growth during the peak holiday season and beating revenue and operating income guidance. Strength was led by The North Face and Timberland, while the Americas region posted its strongest results in over three years. Global direct-to-consumer sales returned to growth, reinforcing management’s confidence in achieving its medium-term financial targets.

V.F. Corp.’s Revenue Details

On a regional basis, revenues in the Americas rose 2% year over year both on a reported basis and on a constant-currency basis. In the EMEA region, revenues were up 4% on a reported basis and down 4% on a constant-currency basis. Revenues in the APAC region were down 6% on a reported basis and 7% down on a constant-currency basis. The company’s International revenues grew 2% year over year on a reported basis and were down 4% on a constant-currency basis.

Channel-wise, wholesale revenues fell 1% on a reported basis. Direct-to-consumer revenues were up 4% year over year on a reported basis and 1% on a constant-currency basis. Our model estimated the wholesale revenues to fall 0.1% and direct-to-consumer revenues to dip 1% year over year.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, V.F. Corp. realigned its reportable segments into two main categories: Outdoor and Active. Operating segments not meeting disclosure thresholds are now grouped under an ""All Other"" category.

Based on reporting segments, revenues in the Outdoor segment improved 8% year over year on a reported basis and 5% on a constant-currency basis to $1,926 million. In the Active segment, revenues of $671.8 million declined 6% year over year on a reported basis and 9% on a constant-currency basis. Revenues in the All Other segment fell 18% year over year on a reported basis and 20% on a constant-currency basis to $278 million.

Financial Details of VFC

V.F. Corp. ended the fiscal third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.5 billion, long-term debt of $3.55 billion and shareholders’ equity of $1.78 billion. Net debt was down $0.5 billion from the year-ago period.

The company’s board has announced a quarterly dividend of 9 cents per share, payable March 19, 2026, to its shareholders of record as of March 10.

Other Details

The company announced a definitive agreement on Sept. 15, 2025, to sell the Dickies brand to Bluestar Alliance LLC and completed the divestiture on Nov. 12. Under U.S. GAAP, Dickies’ results remain included in V.F. Corp.’s third-quarter fiscal 2026 results through the date of sale, as the transaction did not qualify for discontinued-operations treatment. To better reflect ongoing performance following the divestiture, VFC also presents results “excluding Dickies” and “adjusted excluding Dickies,” which remove Dickies’ contribution from all periods and are intended to provide clearer insight into V.F. Corp.’s post-sale operating trends.

In the nine months ended December 2025, VFC spent $51 million on its Reinvent transformation program. These costs mainly covered severance and employee-associated gains and costs with respect to the engagement of a consulting firm to boost the company's transformation journey.

The program led to a net tax benefit of $11.9 million in the nine months of fiscal 2026. VFC has spent $207.7 million in restructuring charges under Reinvent, with all the substantial efforts completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2026.

What to Expect From VFC in Q4 & FY26?

For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026, VFC expects revenues to be flat to up 2% in constant currency compared with the prior year. Adjusted operating income is projected to range between $10 million and $30 million. Adjusted gross margin is likely to be flat to slightly up year over year. Adjusted SG&A are likely to be flat to slightly down.

For fiscal 2026, VFC expects adjusted operating income, operating cash flow and free cash flow to increase year over year, while ending fiscal 2026 with leverage at or below 3.5x. These projections reflect the company’s ongoing progress under its Reinvent transformation program, focused on cost reduction, margin improvement and strategic brand repositioning to drive long-term growth.

The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's shares have gained 27.5% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 5.4% growth.

From Feb. 5-7, the brand will host Levi’s Home Turf, an activation celebrating Bay Area culture through collaborative product drops, live music performances, retail experiences, and customization opportunities.

The activation, located in San Francisco’s financial district, takes place ahead of Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

Events kick off Thursday with a pep rally featuring performances by Bay Area rapper LaRussell and a marching band. On Friday, NPR is bringing the Tiny Desk Experience, sponsored by Levi’s, with Goapele, P-Lo, Souls of Mischief, and Ruby Ibarra. The Levi’s Home Turf experience will also feature an exhibition on local record label Empire celebrating their 15th anniversary.

On Feb. 4, San Francisco vintage retailer Big Time Vintage will host a special store takeover featuring curated vintage Levi’s products and throwback San Francisco 49ers merchandise. Levi’s latest collection with Jordan Brand as well as a collection of NFL team jackets with Starter will be available at the popup.

Levi’s Home Turf will also spotlight the brand’s commitment to denim customizability. Visitors can personalize Levi’s pieces with patches and chainstitching, or book one-on-one customization sessions with design consultants offering laser treatments, rhinestones, and screen printing.

The activation will also host a Wear Longer workshop, featuring a panel of Bay Area artists exploring the intersection of longevity, creativity, and local customization culture. Earlier this month, Levi’s launched Wear Longer, a national initiative developed in partnership with Discovery Education, designed to equip students with practical clothing repair and customization skills.

Levi’s stores will get in on the fun. Select Bay Area retail locations will offer Tailor Shop services, including team-color button swaps, chainstitch embroidery, splatter paint with stencils, foil treatments, and other options for creating one-of-a-kind fan gear. Select stores will also host appearances by rapper E-40 and other athletes and music artists throughout the week.

Though music continues play a large role in Levi’s storytelling, this year the brand said it is shifting gears with activations that celebrate athletes and moments that define competition. In addition to the Super Bowl, Levi’s Stadium will host the World Cup from June to July.

Quick Insights

Sector allocation, specifically an overweight to communication services and underweight to materials, was the main driver of underperformance relative to the benchmark.

Stock selection contributed positively, with strong picks in healthcare and information technology, though this was partially offset by weaker selection in industrials and utilities.

IHOIX will seek to exploit volatility by investing in companies with improving or sustainable returns on capital that are underappreciated by the market.

Other companies that have taken job cuts recently Copyright 2026 The Associated Press.","NEW YORK — As layoffs pile up, workers are feeling increasingly anxious about the job market.

In the U.S., economists have said that businesses are largely at a ""no-hire, no fire"" standstill, leading many to limit new work, if not pause openings entirely amid economic uncertainty. Hiring has stagnated overall — with the country adding a meager 50,000 jobs last month, down from a revised figure of 56,000 in November.

But a growing list of companies are also cutting jobs. Employers have initiated layoffs across sectors — with many pointing to rising operational costs that span from President Donald Trump's barrage of new tariffs, stubborn inflation and shifts in spending from consumers, whose outlook on the U.S. economy recently plummeted to its lowest level since 2014. At the same time, some businesses are reducing their workforces as they redirect money to artificial intelligence, often baked into wider corporate restructuring.

Beyond the private sector, thousands of federal government employees lost their jobs in cuts taken by the Trump administration last year — forcing many to look for new work. That's further strained workers' overall sentiment about finding stable employment today.

Here are a few companies that have announced some of the largest job cuts recently.

Amazon

E-commerce giant Amazon slashed about 16,000 corporate roles on Wednesday — just three months after laying off another 14,000 workers. In its latest round of layoffs, Amazon cited restructuring aimed at ""removing bureaucracy"" in its operations, but the cuts also arrive as the company continues to ramp up spending on AI. CEO Andy Jassy previously said that he anticipated generative AI to reduce Amazon's corporate workforce.

UPS

On Tuesday, United Parcel Service said it plans to cut up to 30,000 operational jobs this year — notably as the package company continues to reduce the number of Amazon shipments it handles amid wider turnaround efforts. UPS said these cuts will be made through a voluntary buyout offer for full-time drivers and attrition. The reductions come on top of a combined 48,000 job cuts that the company disclosed in 2025.

Tyson Foods

Late last year, Tyson Foods said it would be closing a plant that employed 3,200 people in Lexington, Nebraska — bringing job losses for nearly a third of the small town's population of 11,000. The layoffs began on Jan. 20, but the company notified state officials that it was temporarily retaining under 300 workers to help complete the closure. Tyson in November also announced plans to cut one of two shifts at an Amarillo, Texas plant, eliminating an additional 1,700 jobs.

HP

Also in November, HP said it expected to lay off between 4,000 and 6,000 employees. The cuts are part of a wider initiative from the computer maker to streamline operations, which includes adopting AI to increase productivity. The company aims to complete these actions by the end of the 2028 fiscal year.

Verizon

Verizon began laying off more than 13,000 employees in November. In a staff memo announcing the cuts, CEO Dan Schulman said that the telecommunications giant needed to simplify operations and ""reorient"" the entire company.

Nestlé

In mid-October, Nestlé said it would be cutting 16,000 jobs globally — as part of wider cost cutting aimed at reviving its financial performance amid headwinds like rising commodity costs and U.S. imposed tariffs. The Swiss food giant said the layoffs would take place over the next two years.

Novo Nordisk

In September, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk said it would cut 9,000 jobs, about 11% of its workforce. The company — which makes drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy — said the layoffs were part of wider restructuring, as it works to sell more obesity and diabetes medications amid rising competition.

Intel

Intel has moved to shed thousands of jobs as the struggling chipmaker works to revive its business. Last year, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said Intel expected to end 2025 with 75,000 ""core"" workers, excluding subsidiaries, through layoffs and attrition. That's down from 99,500 core employees reported the end of 2024. The company previously announced a 15% workforce reduction.

Procter & Gamble

Last summer, Procter & Gamble said it would cut up to 7,000 jobs over the next two years, 6% of the company's global workforce. The maker of Tide detergent and Pampers diapers said the cuts were part of a wider restructuring — also arriving amid tariff pressures.

Microsoft

Microsoft initiated two rounds of mass layoffs last year — first impacting 6,000 and then another 9,000 positions. The tech giant cited ""organizational changes,"" but the cuts also arrived as the company spends heavily on AI.

ID32,Nvidia,2026-01-28 17:30:17+00:00,Ars Technica,Report: China approves import of high-end Nvidia AI chips after weeks of uncertainty,Benj Edwards,,,,,https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/report-china-approves-import-of-high-end-nvidia-ai-chips-after-weeks-of-uncertainty/,"On Wednesday, China approved imports of Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence chips for three of its largest technology companies, Reuters reported.
ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent received approval to purchase more than 400,000 H200 chips in total, marking a shift in Beijing’s stance after weeks of holding up shipments despite US export clearance.
Chinese customs authorities had told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month, even as Chinese technology companies placed orders for more than two million of the chips.
While Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the H20’s performance, they still lag far behind the H200.
Beijing has previously discouraged domestic technology companies from purchasing foreign chips unless absolutely needed, according to earlier Reuters reporting.","On Wednesday, China approved imports of Nvidia’s H200 artificial intelligence chips for three of its largest technology companies, Reuters reported. ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent received approval to purchase more than 400,000 H200 chips in total, marking a shift in Beijing’s stance after weeks of holding up shipments despite US export clearance.

The move follows Beijing’s temporary halt to H200 shipments earlier this month after Washington cleared exports on January 13. Chinese customs authorities had told agents that the H200 chips were not permitted to enter China, Reuters reported earlier this month, even as Chinese technology companies placed orders for more than two million of the chips.

The H200, Nvidia’s second most powerful AI chip after the B200, delivers roughly six times the performance of the company’s H20 chip, which was previously the most capable chip Nvidia could sell to China. While Chinese companies such as Huawei now have products that rival the H20’s performance, they still lag far behind the H200.

Chinese tech giants want access to Nvidia’s higher-powered AI chips because they dramatically speed up the process of training large AI models, a computationally intensive task of feeding data through neural networks millions of times to tune their performance. More capable chips like the H200 allow companies to train larger models faster or run more AI queries (called inference) at a lower cost.

This has made high-end AI accelerator chips a flashpoint in the ongoing AI race between Washington, DC, and Beijing, with US policymakers caught between wanting to boost sales for American semiconductor companies and fearing that exports could help China close the gap in AI capabilities.

Still, Nvidia wants the business because China is a huge market. The latest approvals came during Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s visit to China this week, according to sources who spoke with Reuters on the condition of anonymity. Other Chinese firms are now waiting for their own approvals in future rounds, though Beijing is attaching conditions to the licenses that have not yet been finalized. One source told Reuters that the license terms were too restrictive and buyers had not yet turned their approvals into actual orders.

Beijing’s balancing act

The approval signals Beijing’s prioritization of its major Internet companies, which are spending billions of dollars to build data centers needed to develop AI services and compete with US rivals, including OpenAI. But regulators are also trying to nurture China’s domestic semiconductor industry, the South China Morning Post reported.

The first batch was expected to go to Big Tech companies in urgent need of the GPU, according to a source who spoke with that publication. However, access for state-backed firms, including telecom operators, was expected to stay tightly restricted.

Beijing has previously discouraged domestic technology companies from purchasing foreign chips unless absolutely needed, according to earlier Reuters reporting. One proposal authorities discussed in the past would require each H200 purchase to be bundled with a set ratio of domestic chips.

“Beijing’s approval of the H200 is driven by purely strategic motives,” Alex Capri, a senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore’s business school, told the South China Morning Post. “Ultimately, this decision is taken to further China’s indigenous capabilities and, by extension, the competitive capabilities of China tech.”",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2131985696-1536x864-1-1152x648.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 16:37:43.772411

Indianapolis-based market leader Eli Lilly spent about $131 million advertising obesity treatment Zepbound in the same period versus $2 million in 2024. It spent $83 million promoting diabetes medicine Mounjaro.

Combined, Novo spent about $487 million and Lilly an estimated $214 million on U.S. ads for these drugs. The companies declined to comment on their advertising budgets.

It is not known how much Novo plans to spend on advertising its new pill version of Wegovy.

David Moore, Novo's executive vice president of U.S. operations, said the company plans to advertise the pill immediately and push sales through its cash-pay, direct-to-consumer channels.

Insurance coverage in the U.S. is uneven for these drugs, prompting many people to pay out‑of‑pocket for them.

ADVERTISING BLITZ REFLECTS AMPLE SUPPLY

The U.S. is unusual in allowing direct‑to‑consumer advertising of prescription medicines, a system that has been criticized as driving up already high U.S. medical costs.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have tried to discourage drugmaker advertising with new disclosure rules.

Last year's advertising blitz reflects a shift in availability for the medicines that were in shortage for much of 2024, with the companies unable to meet unprecedented demand.

During the shortage, Novo halted its ads and then ramped them up in 2025 as supply increased, Moore said.

Also, data released by Lilly in late 2024 showed patients taking Zepbound lost 47% more weight than those who were given Wegovy in a large, head-to-head trial.

""When it comes to weight loss, Lilly has that edge with Zepbound, which is why, likely, Novo is looking to offset that with higher advertising investments,"" Rajiv Leventhal, senior analyst for digital health at market research firm Emarketer.

A Lilly spokesperson said the company is committed to providing information across multiple channels to ensure consumers receive accurate, timely information about its drugs.

U.S. prescriptions for Zepbound overtook Wegovy last year, giving the U.S. drugmaker about 60% of the obesity drug market for 2025, according to IQVIA data shared by a Wall Street analyst. IQVIA did not respond to a request for comment.

Novo and Lilly have also had to deal with telehealth companies selling compounded copies of their drugs. They were able to freely sell their copies while the branded versions were in short supply, but have since turned to selling personalized doses that differ from what the pharmaceutical companies offer in dose size and regimen.

Rae McMahan, senior vice president of payer solutions at Prescryptive, which helps patients find the lowest prices for drugs at pharmacies, said advertising has limits in guiding treatment decisions for the GLP-1 drugs.

""It's still a conversation that needs to be between the patient and their physician,"" McMahan said.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices.

Across EMEA, the customer experience landscape is changing fast — leaving many organisations racing to adapt. AI is reshaping every stage of the buyer journey while customer expectations are constantly evolving.

To understand how organisations are responding to these seismic shifts, we surveyed senior executives across the globe. But the global picture only tells part of the story. In EMEA, a new dynamic is unfolding — revealing unique challenges and opportunities. Here are four of the most significant takeaways.

Unpredictable customer journeys.

Customer journeys are no longer linear — buyers move across channels and devices, and expect personalised, consistent, and mobile-first experiences. AI-driven search, projected to grow from 1% today to 20% by 2027, is reshaping discovery. For EMEA organisations, regional compliance and market diversity make it even more complex. Adobe’s full global report takes a closer look at how top executives are earning customer trust today and building for AI discovery.

Navigating at the speed of AI.

Generative AI is accelerating content creation and personalisation at scale, but maintaining quality and brand consistency is essential. EMEA brands are prioritising compliance and brand safety as top areas of preparedness. While 87% of organisations in Europe are already exploring or adopting AI, the report shows that governance is the real accelerator. Brands can shorten review cycles and build trust in AI-driven content by embedding fact-checks, copyright safeguards, and standardised templates directly into workflows.

Fragmented data — the personalisation roadblock.

Disconnected data and systems are blocking personalisation. Few organisations have fully integrated, accessible data. Central Europe is setting the pace with 74% partial data integration, far ahead of the global average of 49%, while Western Europe sits just above at 50%, and the Middle East is just below at 44%. Confidence in technology is also muted — the study shows that only 28% of executives trust their current platforms, and 15% believe their journey orchestration tools will deliver. Without connected, real-time data, personalisation remains shallow and inconsistent, even as AI accelerates customer expectations.

Agentic AI — the next wave in CX.

Agentic AI is the next leap in automation, powered by intelligent systems that understand context and act autonomously — instead of just responding. It has the ability to anticipate needs, streamline workflows, and help teams move faster while delivering better customer experiences. Adoption across EMEA is projected to reach 30% by 2027, but Western Europe (38%) and Central Europe (39%) are setting the pace, while the Middle East targets 11%. Interestingly, the Middle East is ahead when it comes to learning and exploring agentic AI, at 63% — well above Western Europe at 47% and Central Europe at 42%. Ultimately, the success of agentic AI in CX depends on strong governance and trust.",https://business.adobe.com/uk/resources/sdk/media_17b6987fcd73555568e04564c3b0de45ad17b8498.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2026-01-28 16:35:01.738987

Seagate Smashed Earnings Expectations – What You Need To Know

Seagate reported earnings per share of $3.11, well above expectations of $2.83. From a year earlier, earnings jumped 53%.

Revenue reached $2.83 billion, topping the $2.74 billion consensus estimate and rising 21% year over year. Margins also surprised to the upside, with gross margin coming in at 42.2%.

The company guided for even stronger numbers ahead. For the current quarter, Seagate expects $2.90 billion in revenue at the midpoint, far ahead of the Street’s $2.81 billion. Operating EPS is projected at $3.40—above the consensus estimate of $3.03.

In a note on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider raised his price target on the stock from $310 to $385.

AI Boom Fuels Tight Supply, Firm Pricing

""Management noted that its production capacity is now sold out for 2026, and it expects key hyperscaler customers to begin placing orders for 2027 in the near future,"" Schneider said.

The tight supply-demand dynamic has allowed the firm to raise prices per terabyte and boost margins, with management forecasting sequential EPS and revenue growth through 2026.

“Seagate reported a modest increase in price per Terabyte in the quarter, and management expects a further increase this quarter,” Schneider added.

""We believe management’s intent to not add unit production capacity should underpin investor confidence in a tight supply environment for the foreseeable future,"" Goldman said.

Seagate also showed progress in its heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology. The company shipped 1.5 million HAMR drives last quarter, up from 1 million previously, and has now qualified its Mozaic 3 with all major U.S. hyperscalers.

Analysts remain bullish. ""We see Seagate as a key beneficiary of persistent industry tightness and firm pricing trends,"" Schneider said, though he flagged potential risks like supply overshoots or slow customer adoption of new tech.

Massport is looking to create cargo or logistics operations at Worcester Regional Airport and to grow the airport’s passenger count, part of a wider effort to expand the usefulness of the airport it took control of in 2010. In order to become self-sustaining, Worcester Regional needs to continue to increase its passenger count and capture new business opportunities, according to a draft version of the Massport 2025 Strategic Plan released Thursday. Worcester Regional served 230,000 passengers in 2024, marking the highest volume of passengers in 34 years, according to the strategic report, up from 193,000 in 2023. Worcester’s 549% passenger growth since 2009 is the second-highest growth rate among all New England airports, after Tweed New Haven Airport. Massport aspires to have more than 500,000 passengers using the Worcester airport annually by 2035, according to the report. However, a number of obstacles to further growth are present, including the airport’s relative proximity to Boston Logan International Airport and regional airports like Bradley International Airport in Connecticut, Manchester-Boston Regional Airport in New Hampshire, and Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport, all of which have more flight options and higher passenger counts. Both T.F. Green and Bradley benefit from state incentive programs that lower the barrier of entry for airlines. The report states Massport is examining incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to retain flights. The Worcester airport offers flights to Philadelphia by American Airlines, flights to New York’s LaGuardia Airport by Delta Air Lines, and flights to Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, and winter-spring seasonal flights to Fort Myers by JetBlue, according to the airport’s website. Speaking at a Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce event earlier in January, Massport CEO Rich Davey said four out of the five passenger flights leaving Worcester operate at a loss, according to Spectrum News 1. Davey said Worcester will continue to focus on airlines like Delta and JetBlue, rather than ultra-low-budget brands like Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines, which are struggling with current market conditions. Cargo operations at the airport involve niche uses like specialty pharmaceuticals and urgent medical logistics, according to the report, although cargo-specific flights seem to be rare; Worcester Regional did not have any all-cargo flights in 2024, according to the Federal Aviation Administration’s 2024 list of all-cargo landed weight at airports in the country. Cargo contained in the belly of passenger flights is not included among that data. This compares to other regional airports like Manchester-Boston, which saw 646.82 million pounds of landed cargo in 2024, and T.F Green, which saw 110.66 million pounds, according to FAA. The concept of growing Worcester Regional’s cargo operations has been floated for more than 25 years, with a 1999 Worcester Regional Research Bureau report studying what would need to be done in order to make that happen. The report cited the airport’s limited highway access, and noted that major cargo operators like FedEx and UPS already have well-established infrastructure for accepting cargo at Logan and then using trucks to move it to distribution sites in Central Massachusetts, something that has only increased in the years since. That report came before Massport took over ownership of the airport from the City of Worcester in 2010. Since then, Massport has invested $100 million in the airport, including the construction of a CAT III landing system, designed to make landings possible even with low visibility. Despite the investments, obstacles for both increasing passenger and cargo operations at Worcester Regional remain, including its inability to support large, wide-bodied aircraft like the Boeing 767 and Boeing 777, according to the report. Public comment on Massport’s 2025 strategic plan closes on March 6, with a virtual presentation on the plan scheduled for Feb. 5. Eric Casey is the managing editor at Worcester Business Journal, who primarily covers the real estate and banking & finance industries.

“Last year was about managing disruptions,” Abe Eshkenazi, CEO of the Association for Supply Chain Management, said in an interview with Supply Chain Dive.
Amid these factors and market dynamics, here’s a look at supply shortages to watch out for in 2026.
“The inflation outlook continues to be influenced by volatility in global trade and supply chain conditions,” Vizient’s Spend Management Outlook says.
“If I’m a supply chain manager, I’m looking at all the potential options and trying to build as much resiliency as I can,” Ganio said.","Supply chain professionals will find 2026 marked by shortages, rising costs and shifting trade dynamics. Navigating the pressures will make sourcing resilience a critical strategy in several sectors, including food, metals, healthcare and electronics.

Many companies sharpened their attention on resilience after President Donald Trump upended supply chains by using tariffs to address national security issues and drug trafficking.

In 2026, companies will build on those efforts with stronger partnerships with suppliers willing to invest in collaboration, innovation and joint problem-solving, experts said. Working together can improve reliability and reduce risk.

“Last year was about managing disruptions,” Abe Eshkenazi, CEO of the Association for Supply Chain Management, said in an interview with Supply Chain Dive. “Right now, it’s about redesigning your global network.”

Rearchitecting networks includes a deeper look at inventory levels to reduce the risk of shortages, Eshkenazi said.

“We’re seeing organizations pick up additional costs with moving inventory forward and building up inventory so they can mitigate short-term shocks to the system,” Eshkenazi said.

Companies are also adapting supply chains to product changes made necessary by component constraints, Amanda Khalaf, a partner at global management consultancy Argon & Co., said in an interview with Supply Chain Dive.

“Some companies are looking at rationalizing their actual SKU base and their product base in order to mitigate against some of the price increases that will come in 2026,” Khalaf said of computer manufacturers’ response to higher memory prices.

Amid these factors and market dynamics, here’s a look at supply shortages to watch out for in 2026.

Rising copper demand will squeeze global supply

In 2026, supply chain managers will confront a copper shortage and higher prices as global competition intensifies for the metal, which industries use in a growing number of electronic systems, including AI technology, data centers and military infrastructure.

J.P. Morgan Global Research expects the U.S. will face a refined copper deficit of 330,000 metric tons this year, tightening the market and raising prices to an average of $12,075 per metric ton for the full year.

Meanwhile, the potential for additional U.S. tariffs on refined copper imports could further boost demand this year, per Goldman Sachs Research.

President Donald Trump has already installed 50% levies on semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products, but an additional 15% duty could start on Jan. 1, 2027, depending on the outcome of a Commerce Department investigation. Copper imports to the U.S. could subsequently rise as companies build up stock ahead of possible levies, according to Goldman Sachs.

“Until there’s another substitute available for exactly what you need, it’s going to be a fight based on who can actually pay the most,” Rupal Deshmukh, a partner in the strategic operations practice at global management consulting firm Kearney, said.

Beyond higher demand, copper supply risks stem from the production dominance of a small set of countries, which gives a limited group of producers and processors outsized influence over prices and long-term offtake contracts, according to S&P Global’s Copper in the Age of AI report.

U.S. critical mineral supply will remain vulnerable

The potential disruption of the entire critical mineral supply that feeds advanced technologies across U.S. energy, military and commercial applications will remain a supply risk in 2026, according to experts. Adding to the pressure is the U.S.’s dependence on strategic competitor China for critical minerals it cannot produce itself, a dependence unlikely to change in the near-term, according to TD Economics, the research arm of TD Bank Group.

In 2025, China, a key source for mining and home to 85% of global critical mineral refining capacity, demonstrated a willingness to weaponize its position by tightening export restrictions on graphite, antimony and certain rare earths in retaliation for U.S. trade and technology controls, according to the Atlantic Council, a Washington, D.C., think tank.

Given the instability in U.S.-China trade relations over the last year, it’s difficult to predict the impact on mineral supplies in 2026.

“I think everyone is expecting that some of the downstream impact will be higher prices for some of the minerals,” Adam Borchert, a partner at Bain & Co., said, adding, “In fact, we expect in the next two to five years, we’ll see some shortages.”

Medical supply costs to rise, pressuring supply

Procurement executives trying to keep hospital shelves full can expect to pay more for medical and surgical supplies in 2026, according to Vizient, a healthcare performance improvement company.

Vizient’s latest Spend Management Outlook, published in July, estimates the full-year inflation rate for medical and surgical supplies will reach 2.58% in 2026. Vizient maintained the projection in its State of the Healthcare Industry 2026 report, published in January.

“The inflation outlook continues to be influenced by volatility in global trade and supply chain conditions,” Vizient’s Spend Management Outlook says. “Rising raw material costs—driven by supply constraints, increased global demand and geopolitical instability—are contributing to elevated prices across many healthcare categories.”

The paucity of manufacturers for some devices also contributes to supply constraints, Micah Parker, SVP of spend management solutions at Vizient, said.

“Especially in that medical device space, sometimes manufacturing locations are very limited on where they may produce those products,” Parker said, adding, “If it’s one or two locations in the world, that adds risk.”

Vizient also expects drug prices to rise in 2026. In fact, the projected inflation rate for overall pharmacy spend is higher than for medical and surgical supplies, according to the company, which expects overall drug price inflation to reach 3.35% between January and December.

Read More in Manufacturing

The dominance of specialty and complex medications in new drug approvals, along with higher-than-customary price increases for previously approved products, is behind the projected hike. Injectable drugs tend to account for the more severe shortages, according to Michael Ganio, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists’ senior director of pharmacy practice and quality.

“If I’m a supply chain manager, I’m looking at all the potential options and trying to build as much resiliency as I can,” Ganio said.

Memory chip constraints will test automakers

The auto industry is bracing for a tighter market for memory chips as suppliers such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix and Micron Technology reallocate wafer capacity toward higher-margin, high-bandwidth memory for AI data centers, according to an S&P Global Mobility Automotive Insights report.

“In 2026 and 2027, [dynamic random access memory] capacity will be constrained but elastic,” the report said. “If automotive clients are ready to pay more to match the wafer value DRAM makers would get from other industries, then they will get the volume they need.”

Deshmukh of consulting firm Kearney described the market environment more succinctly: “The highest bidder wins. It’s not going to be a question of supply magically appearing.”

Procuring the needed volume will be expensive. S&P Global Mobility predicts DRAM prices could rise by 70% to 100% in 2026 compared to 2025.

“In this environment, supply chain resilience is crucial,” S&P Global Mobility said. “OEMs and tier 1 suppliers may wish to build buffer inventory as DRAM makers pivot to data center applications, but this strategy offers limited long-term relief.”

Meanwhile, major memory manufacturers are preparing for quarterly price hikes of 20% to 70% across automotive memory, with lead times for new orders expected to exceed 58 weeks, according to Fusion Worldwide, an independent electronic components distributor.

The critical role semiconductor memory chips play in modern vehicle electronic systems is driving the high demand, Fusion said. Automakers use the chips in infotainment systems, sensor and image processing, and driver-assistance and autonomous-driving electronic control units.

Beginning in 2028, the supply of older DRAM generations, still widely used in the auto industry, will dry up rapidly, no matter how much carmakers are willing to pay, S&P Global Mobility said. Therefore, the industry has two years to change designs and migrate to newer memory technologies.

​Cattle shortages will keep supply tight

After enduring a 75-year low in cattle herds last season, food manufacturers could face even more stringent beef supply in 2026.

Driving the tight supply are ranchers hesitant to rebuild after years of drought, challenging economics and the resurgence of a flesh-eating pest known as the New World screwworm, which has led to restrictions on cattle imports from Mexico.

“The situation will continue to be monitored as tight cattle suppliers remain a focal point into the future, which will challenge packers’ ability to operate efficiently and profitably,” the USDA said in its December Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry Outlook.

The USDA projects U.S. production will decline by 1% year over year in 2026, with beef supplies tightening further as cattle raisers retain young female cattle for breeding rather than sending them to processing. Tyson Foods President and CEO Donnie King told investors in August that the industry won’t see the supply benefits of this maneuver for a couple of years.

The market turmoil has affected prices. In August, U.S. retail beef prices reached a record $9.18 a pound, according to RaboResearch, a unit of Rabobank, which specializes in agricultural financing.

“Additional price increases are expected to 2026 and 2027,” RaboResearch said in its Global Animal Protein Outlook 2026. “The U.S. is seeing a modest increase in heifer retention, but the more notable trend is a slowdown in herd liquidation.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Yho_pyNGD9bqHENgv_N96fH4LQS_Iq-z12luaDxzTzo/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMTc5NjUyODg0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2026-01-28 16:41:11.387893

China's government has given clearance to a few big tech companies in the country including ByteDance and Alibaba (BABA) to start placing orders for Nvidia's (NVDA) H200 AI chips, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.

The initial approval would allow the companies to buy hundreds of thousands of chips worth around $10 billion, according to the Journal. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.

Last month, President Donald Trump greenlighted the H200 chips, which were previously banned from export to China on national security grounds, for sale to the country in exchange for Nvidia agreeing to give the U.S. government a 25% cut of sales.

CFO Colette Kress said earlier this month that the U.S. government was ""working feverishly"" on ironing out the details of that deal, and that Nvidia expected to be able to ship to China soon. However, the company still faced some uncertainty about approval from the Chinese government, which has previously discouraged Chinese companies from buying chips over security concerns.

The report shows tips for UberEats and DoorDash Delivery Workers fell by more than $550 million, while holding steady on rival platforms that kept their interfaces unchanged.

Since the DCWP began enforcing the Minimum Pay Rate in December 2023, total pay to Workers has increased by $1.2 billion - and the industry has continued to grow.

With a new law protecting tips coming this year, the DCWP is committed to ensuring Workers earn the pay they deserve and consumers are restored the option to tip without barriers.

DCWP Commissioner Samuel A.A. Levine said: “Our report ‘blows the whistle on a massive scheme’ by Uber and DoorDash ‘to drive down’ Worker pay ‘by more than ($550 million).’ ‘That era has come to end.’ Under Mayor Mamdani, ‘the biggest corporations in the world will no longer be able to rake in record profits on the backs of’ Workers and consumers. ‘If’ these companies ‘do not follow new tipping laws going into effect later this month, they will face significant’ consequences.”

Ligia Gualla, the Executive Director of Worker’s Justice Project and Co-Founder of its Los Deliveristas Unidos Campaign, said: “This report confirms what Deliveristas ‘have lived for years:’ When Workers won a Living Wage, the App Companies ‘retaliated by intentionally blocking access to tips to keep’ Workers ‘vulnerable and dependent.’ ‘Time and again,’ when Deliveristas ‘fight for dignified pay and dignified work, these companies do everything they can to undermine those gains - but we will not be stopped.’ That is why we are grateful to Mayor Mamdani and DCWP Commissioner Levine ‘for standing with’ Workers ‘and announcing a new era’ of enforcement and accountability. We look forward to working with DCWP to ensure App Companies ‘fully comply’ with the protections Workers have won - including Minimum Pay, deactivation protections, and pay and tipping transparency - ‘and to shutting down every loophole the App Companies and their reckless algorithms may use to exploit’ Workers. Thank you DCWP for continuing to expose these abuses and for fighting alongside us to build ‘Deliverista Power.’""",,N,,2026-01-28 16:43:48.347938

Nvidia will reportedly use Intel for only some of its chips, namely the non-core bits.
It's said to be choosing between Intel Foundry's 18A or 14A process nodes, dependent on whether Intel has high enough yields to reliably produce enough chips on the latter.
That could go away at some point, and Intel Foundry will need something special to compete with TSMC in the long-run.","Intel has had a tough time convincing companies to come to its manufacturing division, Intel Foundry. Few are biting—preferring to go with tried-and-tested options, namely TSMC. Though the company may have just won a very important customer: Nvidia.

According to Digitimes, citing supply chain sources, Nvidia has signed on with Intel Foundry to manufacture some parts of its forthcoming Feynman chips.

Nvidia will reportedly use Intel for only some of its chips, namely the non-core bits. It's said to be choosing between Intel Foundry's 18A or 14A process nodes, dependent on whether Intel has high enough yields to reliably produce enough chips on the latter.

TSMC, the top dog in Taiwan, will still be leading the charge with the most important silicon, the GPU itself. Most likely on its A16 process node.

Feynman is the next major architecture on from Rubin and Rubin Ultra, which is set to arrive from 2028. Revealed at GTC last year, named after physicist Richard Feynman, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said very little about the tech specs of the new chip, but a slide behind him titled ""Nvidia Paves Road to Gigawatt AI Factories"" depicted the chip paired with a Vera CPU, IO, and network chips.

With gaming GPUs still on Blackwell, the architecture prior to Rubin, there's not much here for gamers as of yet.

Intel is in no hurry to tool up its fabs for 14A production. In an earnings call last week, Intel CFO David Zinsner confirmed that it's ""aggressively getting tools on Intel 7, 10, 3, 18A"" but ""holding back on is 14A.""

""14A is really linked to foundry customers, and it does not make sense to build out significant capacity there until we know that we have the customers that will accept that demand,"" Zinsner said.

This follows on from comments made in an SEC filing earlier in 2025 by the company's CEO, Lip Bu-Tan, that put investment into 14A and future cutting-edge process nodes into jeopardy.

""If we are unable to secure a significant external customer and meet important customer milestones for Intel 14A, we face the prospect that it will not be economical to develop and manufacture Intel 14A and successor leading-edge nodes on a go-forward basis.

""In such event, we may pause or discontinue our pursuit of Intel 14A and successor nodes and various of our manufacturing expansion projects.""

Though, since that time, both the US government and Nvidia have bought a stake in the business—Nvidia and Intel will team up on some chips in future—and the rhetoric from the White House has shifted to aggressively pushing companies to manufacture their chips within the United States. Hence why something once as unthinkable as Nvidia using Intel's manufacturing biz is now closer to reality—there's politics at play.

Intel is also reported to be involved in the packaging process for Feynman, taking on around 25% due to the use of its EMIB tech, which Intel uses to connect various dies together on its chips. TSMC will deal with the rest.

So, tentatively a win for Intel, though one surely derived in part from political pressure. That could go away at some point, and Intel Foundry will need something special to compete with TSMC in the long-run. As it stands today, 14A and subsequent process nodes are still on shaky ground.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b7T65ugLXkyJXFxDk73yNU-1920-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 16:38:11.836627

Both investors have acquired an undisclosed stake in the London-founded company, which launched in 2011 and has since grown into one of Europe’s largest renewable energy platforms. Low Carbon develops and operates solar, onshore wind and battery storage projects across multiple countries.

The announcement comes just days after Low Carbon revealed it had raised £500m in debt from a consortium of European and Japanese lenders, including Société Générale, Santander, Norway’s DNB, and UK banks Lloyds, NatWest and HSBC, among others.

LGPS Central said it was drawn to the firm’s regulated, government-backed income profile through Contracts for Difference (CfDs). As one of the UK’s largest recipients of CfDs, the platform offers predictable, long-dated cashflows and plays a significant role in the country’s renewable energy supply.

Nadeem Hussain, head of private markets at LGPS Central, said: “This investment sits at the heart of our infrastructure strategy. Low Carbon’s vertically integrated model and strong contract profile provide the kind of long-term, productive exposure we seek for our partner funds. At the same time, it supports the UK’s transition to clean energy, contributing to national resilience and the development of a modern, sustainable power system.”

LGPS Central currently has around £2bn invested in infrastructure but expects that allocation to grow as it takes on seven new partner funds, pushing its combined assets under management above the £100bn mark.",https://www.netzeroinvestor.net/images/uploads/ansel-content-images/shutterstock_2206413513-66e2d42b6b828-3094-1769613517.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 16:41:57.104108

Market Share Analysis - Gluten Free Food Market 3.","Dublin, Jan. 28, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Gluten Free Food Market Companies Analysis Key Players Analysis, Company Profiles, Product Developments, Mergers, Strategic Collaborations, and Revenue Forecast Insights"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The international market for gluten-free food was estimated at around US$ 7.22 billion in 2025. It is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.75% during the period 2025-2033 and reach an estimated value of around US$ 14.13 billion in 2033.

Products that don't include gluten, a protein present in wheat, barley, rye, and their derivatives, are referred to as gluten-free foods. Since gluten consumption can have negative health effects for those with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or wheat allergies, these foods are crucial. Cereals, bread, spaghetti, snacks, and baked goods produced with substitutes including rice, corn, quinoa, and almond flour are examples of common gluten-free products. Gluten-free goods have become more popular among health-conscious customers looking for cleaner, more natural diets, even outside of medical need. Consequently, the gluten-free market has moved from specialized diet items to general consumption.

The market for gluten-free foods is expanding due to growing awareness of gluten intolerance and celiac disease as well as the growing popularity of healthy lifestyles. Foods that are seen as natural, organic, and easy to digest are preferred by consumers who are growing more health concerned. The market appeal has increased due to product innovation by major food producers, such as fortified, plant-based, and clean-label gluten-free choices.

Better labeling laws and the expansion of e-commerce have also increased the accessibility and transparency of products. The popularity of weight-loss programs, social media influence, and celebrity endorsements have increased demand and fueled the global spread of gluten-free food options in a variety of sectors.

Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.54 days to cover their short positions on average.

Why Short Interest Matters

Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.

Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Comparing U.S. Bancorp's Short Interest Against Its Peers

Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.

According to Benzinga Pro, U.S. Bancorp's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 0.78%, which means the company has more short interest than most of its peers.

The collaboration with Lilly adds hearing loss to the as-yet-undisclosed internal therapeutic areas of focus for Seamless.","Eli Lilly plans to expand its hearing loss therapy pipeline by collaborating with Seamless Therapeutics to apply the company’s next-generation gene-editing approach, based on programmable recombinases, to develop and commercialize hearing loss treatments—a deal that could generate more than $1.12 billion for the German startup.

Under a strategic global research collaboration and licensing agreement with Lilly, Seamless has agreed to design and program site-specific recombinases directed toward correcting mutations in undisclosed genes of interest related to hearing loss. Seamless has agreed to grant Lilly an exclusive license to the programmed recombinases to advance through preclinical and clinical drug development and commercialization.

Lilly and Seamless will develop the treatments based on Seamless’s recombinase platform, which is designed to perform large, precise insertions of DNA in any target gene sequence, independent of the cell’s natural DNA repair pathway.

Seamless will use its platform to identify a programmable recombinase capable of inserting Lilly’s genes of interest.

“We’ll use a series of different models and bioinformatics to scan all the nucleotides in the region that they’re interested in. We’ll identify areas in there that are similar to, say, the wild-type binding site of these enzymes, or that we have optimism that we can evolve it to those particular sites,” Albert Seymour, PhD, Seamless’s president, CEO, and managing director, told GEN.

Seamless uses its platform to reprogram two recombinase families: Cre (short for causes recombination) and large serine recombinases.

“We’ll start in a region of the genome. We’ll pick nucleotide sequences in there, and then we evolve the enzymes specifically for activity at those particular sites,” Seymour said. “We evolve in bacteria, because they’re very fast, we can do a lot of cycles really quickly, and then we take those enzymes and then test in mammalian cell lines.”

TU Dresden spinout

Seamless is a Technische Universität Dresden (TU Dresden) spinout founded to commercialize the recombinase reprogramming discoveries of its scientific founders—Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Frank Buchholz, PhD, professor for medical systems biology and head of translational research at TU Dresden’s university cancer center, and Felix Lansing, PhD, co-founder and CTO of Seamless. Buchholz, who chairs Seamless’s Scientific Advisory Board, and his research team discovered they can use reprogrammed recombinases using directed evolution.

“They can take that enzyme and randomly mutate it and screen it and cycle it until you keep the properties that we all like about the recombinases, which are these seamless edits, but have it change its binding site. And you can change its binding site at the DNA level to sites that you want in the genome,” Seymour explained. “Seamless has taken that academic process, which used to take two years in order to find an enzyme, and really shortened it down to more industrial industry standards, which would be maybe six months.”

Seamless’s editing approach drew interest from Lilly, given its commitment in recent years to expand in genetic medicines. The pharma giant launched the $700 million Institute for Genetic Medicine in 2021 in Boston’s Fort Point section as part of a strategy of advancing gene and gene editing therapies, RNA- and other nucleic acid-based therapeutics. The Institute operates in Boston and New York City, where Lilly-owned neuroscience gene therapy developer Prevail Therapeutics is based. Prevail was acquired in 2021 for up to $1.04 billion.

The Lilly-Seamless collaboration is the culmination of talks begun in 2024 when a team from Lilly approached Seamless seeking to learn more about its recombinase technology.

“There was some recognition and knowledge of what Frank and his team were doing. So, Lilly came to us about the technology initially. And then through a series of discussions, showing them what progress we had been making, that’s when we got together and said, hey, maybe this could really be applied to a gene of interest that Lily was interested in,” Seymour recalled.

“We look at it as a great partnership for Seamless, because it gets us into a disease area that we were not working on, and allows us to bring the expertise in the recombinase discovery and the editing part. Lilly brings the expertise of the disease biology, the IND enabling, as well as the development and commercialization in these fields,” Seymour added. “It’s a win-win, if you will, putting the two companies together.”

Expanding hearing loss pipeline

The Lilly collaboration—Seamless’s first announced partnership with a biopharma giant—expands the portion of Lilly’s pipeline focused on hearing loss. That portion is anchored by AK-OTOF, a gene therapy designed to treat sensorineural hearing loss due to mutations in the otoferlin gene (OTOF). AK-OTOF was initially developed by Akouos, which became a subsidiary of Lilly after it acquired the hearing loss therapy developer in 2022 for up to $610 million.

Two years later, Lilly announced positive initial clinical results from the Phase I/II AK-OTOF-101 trial (NCT05821959) showing AK-OTOF to have restored hearing within 30 days of dosing in the trial’s first participant, a person said to have a decade-plus history of profound hearing loss.

AK-OTOF is one of several gene therapies in clinical-phase development for hearing loss indications. Others include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ DB-OTO, a dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy designed to treat children with profound, congenital hearing loss caused by mutations in the OTOF gene; and Sensorion Therapeutics’s OTOF-GT (SENS-501), a dual AAV gene therapy being developed to treat profound congenital deafness caused by otoferlin deficiency.

Akouos’ pipeline also includes another clinical phase gene therapy candidate—AAVAnc80-antiVEGF (also called AK-antiVEGF), an AAV-based treatment for vestibular schwannoma (also called acoustic neuroma) that targets vascular endothelial growth factor and uses the synthetic Anc80 capsid. The treatment is being assessed in the Phase I portion of a Phase I/II trial (NCT06517888) that has an estimated primary completion date of August 2029.

Beyond AAVAnc80-antiVEGF, Akouos’ pipeline, according to its website, includes preclinical programs designed to treat Usher syndrome type 3A by targeting CLRN1, GJB2-mediated hearing loss by targeting GJB2, and programs designed to treat autosomal dominant hearing loss and promote hair cell regeneration.

Lilly also expanded its footprint into treatments for sensorineural hearing loss last year by launching a collaboration with Rznomics to develop therapies based on the South Korean biopharma’s RNA-editing trans-splicing ribozyme platform technology. The collaboration could generate up to $1.3 billion for RZnomics, not counting royalties on product sales.

The collaboration with Lilly adds hearing loss to the as-yet-undisclosed internal therapeutic areas of focus for Seamless. The company’s goals for 2026 include identifying its first development candidate from its internal pipeline.

Seamless formally launched in 2023 with €12.5 million ($14.8 million) in seed financing co-led by Forbion and Wellington Partners, with nondilutive funding from Germany’s Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) through its GO-Bio initiative aimed at supporting innovative life sciences startups.

$40M in seed funding

That seed financing grew later that year to $25 million, then to $40 million, not including the upfront payment it will receive from Lilly, the amount of which is not being disclosed. Seamless also attracted two additional investors, 4Beyond and UCB Ventures, the venture capital arm of UCB.

In addition to the upfront cash, Lilly has agreed to pay Seamless funding committed to research and development, plus payments tied to achieving development and commercial milestones—all totaling more than $1.12 billion. That sum does not include tiered royalties on any successfully marketed drugs developed through the collaboration.

Seamless is based in Dresden, Germany, with offices in Lexington, MA, which are expected to grow as the company moves into development phases for its treatment candidates. Dresden is where Seamless carries out its directed evolution process for recombinase discovery, since many of its researchers emerged from Dresden University, from which Seamless licenses its technology. In Lexington, Seamless is building out R&D expertise to take its recombinases from pharmacology, disease biology, and other IND-enabling studies through clinical and regulatory development.

Lexington is a suburb within the Boston/Cambridge, MA, region—the nation’s leading cluster in GEN’s A-List of Top 10 U.S. Bioppharma Clusters. Seamless’ desire to tap into Boston-area expertise brought the company to Seymour’s attention in November 2023.

Three months later, he joined Seamless as its CEO after previously serving as CSO and later president and CEO of Homology Medicines, a rare disease genetic medicine developer that merged in 2024 with Q32 Bio. Earlier, Seymour served in senior leadership positions at Shire and Pfizer.

“The company really resonated with me because they were working on some enzymes that I knew a little bit about and was familiar with,” Seymour said. “I liked the idea that these are enzymes that have been around for a long time, so there was quite a bit known about them. I just felt it was a very differentiated approach to gene editing, and I had some of that experience.”",https://www.genengnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-888398810-copy-RESIZE6000-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 10:29:43.109580

With its ‘recombinase on demand’, Dresden has secured a place in the spotlight of the gene editing scene.","The Dresden biotech company Seamless Therapeutics GmbH (with its US Inc. subsidiary based in the Boston area) has signed a worldwide strategic research and licensing agreement with Eli Lilly and Company. The aim of the collaboration is the development and subsequent commercialisation of programmable, recombinase-based gene therapies for selected forms of genetically caused hearing loss.

As part of the collaboration, Seamless contributes its proprietary recombinase platform, which enables precise and large-scale DNA insertions and modifications independently of cellular DNA repair mechanisms. This is the key differentiator of the editing method devised by Prof Frank Buchholz at the Medical Faculty of TU Dresden compared with the more widely used CRISPR/Cas technology. Lilly brings its extensive development and clinical expertise in genetic hearing disorders, while Seamless focuses on identifying and designing the appropriate recombinase for the targeted DNA sequence.

Within the project, Seamless will develop tailored, site-specific recombinases designed to correct disease-causing mutations in selected target genes. Owing to the multiple activity centres of recombinases, both cutting and the insertion of very long DNA fragments can be achieved with high precision. Although the platform is still at an early preclinical stage, Eli Lilly is entering the collaboration with a substantial deal volume and, in return, receives an exclusive licence in the hearing loss field to advance the candidates preclinically and clinically and to commercialise them.

A platform in the shop window for further partners

Albert Seymour, CEO of Seamless Therapeutics, emphasised the strategic importance of the collaboration and the validation of the company’s technology platform. “Lilly is invested in advancing novel treatment approaches for genetic diseases and shares our vision of bringing genetic medicines to patients who currently have limited treatment options. This collaboration is a validation of our gene editing platform and its broad disease-modifying potential.”

Financially, the agreement includes a guaranteed upfront payment as well as committed research and development funding. In total, Seamless may receive payments of up to USD 1.1 billion, including development and commercial milestone payments. Tiered, sales-based royalties are not included. Further details of the agreement have not been disclosed.

Speaking to European Biotech News, Seymour added: “Our task is to identify and nominate the most suitable recombinase from several developed candidates for further development by Lilly. Lilly contributes the expertise in the genetics of hearing loss. This model also lends itself to further collaborations that fit our corporate strategy.”

Directed evolution delivers tools of choice

Recombinases have been used in basic research for decades. Seamless Therapeutics has, however, further developed and programmed this enzyme class to enable highly precise genetic changes such as the insertion, exchange or removal of DNA sequences at defined genomic loci. “What convinced Lilly was that we were able to present data from animal studies,” Seymour commented. “We are now truly at the point where we are moving beyond platform development and heading decisively towards the clinic.”

Seymour is primarily based in a suburb of Boston and has long been familiar with the US East Coast biotech scene. He sees Seamless as distinctly positioned compared with many other companies in the CRISPR field or broader gene therapy approaches. “With our ability to design recombinases for specific sequences and the various options a recombinase offers beyond cutting, we have opened up an entirely new field.”

Seamless does not intend to remain solely a service provider and development partner for the pharmaceutical industry, despite growing interest. The Dresden-based company also aims to advance its own recombinase programme as far as possible in a self-selected indication. Data and details on the exact target are expected to be presented later this year.

Stolt-Nielsen ( (SOIEF) ) just unveiled an announcement.

Stolt-Nielsen reported a fourth-quarter 2025 net profit of $59.6 million on revenue of $680.6 million, down from $91.4 million and $709.4 million a year earlier, while full-year 2025 net profit fell to $350.2 million on $2.77 billion in revenue from $394.8 million on $2.89 billion in 2024. Consolidated quarterly EBITDA declined to $186.0 million and earnings per share to $1.12, reflecting weaker freight rates and higher costs across its main divisions, even as the company remained within the upper end of its earnings guidance. Stolt Tankers’ operating profit dropped sharply amid a 19% fall in average time-charter equivalent earnings, Stolthaven Terminals saw lower profit despite stable utilisation in a sluggish chemical market, and Stolt Tank Containers faced margin pressure from intensifying competition, while smaller units, including Stolt Sea Farm and Stolt-Nielsen Gas, improved their combined operating result. Strategically, the group strengthened its position in liquid logistics by acquiring UK-based ISO tank operator Suttons International, adding 11,000 tanks to its fleet, and signalled a planned partial sell-down of its stake in Avenir LNG to support that business’s growth, moves that underscore a focus on scale, productivity and portfolio optimisation in a volatile macroeconomic and geopolitical environment.

The most recent analyst rating on (SOIEF) stock is a Hold with a NOK370.00 price target. To see the full list of analyst forecasts on Stolt-Nielsen stock, see the SOIEF Stock Forecast page.

AutoUnify has introduced AgentUnify, a groundbreaking artificial-intelligence commerce platform designed to transform how people buy and service vehicles online. This new technology makes it possible for consumers to complete almost every part of their car journey from researching vehicles and comparing options to booking test drives and service appointments directly through AI chat assistants such as ChatGPT, without ever leaving the conversation.

As more people turn to AI to help them explore products and make decisions, the automotive industry is rapidly adapting. Traditional dealership websites and lead forms are giving way to conversational experiences driven by AI assistants. AgentUnify taps into this shift by enabling automotive brands including manufacturers, dealerships, and service centers to become fully shoppable inside chatbots. Users can get real-time inventory details, schedule appointments, and even book services while chatting with their AI agent, making the buying and servicing process smoother and more intuitive.

AutoUnify’s solution is powered by its existing unified API platform, AppUnify, which seamlessly connects to the main dealership and service management systems across the industry. This lets AgentUnify provide accurate, up-to-date information and transactional capabilities straight into AI conversations. For dealers, the shift means receiving confirmed bookings and engagements not just cold leads which can significantly improve customer conversion and satisfaction.

Joel Milne, CEO of AutoUnify, says the company sees this as a major pivot in consumer expectations. As buyers increasingly rely on AI not just for discovery but for action, tools like AgentUnify aim to keep automotive commerce firmly in step with modern digital habits.

Société Générale Restructuring And Cost Cuts Tested Against Strong Share Gains

January 28, 2026

Société Générale Société anonyme has announced a major restructuring that includes a proposal to cut 1,800 positions.

The reduction is expected to occur through natural attrition and internal mobility rather than direct layoffs.

The move is framed as an effort to improve operational efficiency in light of broader pressures facing the banking sector.

Société Générale Société anonyme, traded under ENXTPA:GLE, enters this restructuring with its shares at €72.4. Over the past year the stock has delivered a 144.4% return, with a 206.0% return over three years and a very large gain over five years. Recent shorter term performance, including a 4.9% return over the past week and 6.5% over the past month, indicates that investors are closely watching the latest corporate moves.

For you as an investor, this restructuring highlights the importance of looking at how cost measures affect the bank's long term efficiency and service footprint. It is worth tracking management updates on which business units are affected, any changes to customer facing operations, and how the bank balances cost control with growth plans. These details can help you assess whether the new structure aligns with the type of exposure you want in your portfolio.

Key Considerations

📊 The 1,800 position reduction aims to lower costs. You may want to think about how leaner operations could influence profitability over time.

📊 Monitor updates on restructuring execution, capital ratios and how revenue holds up as the bank adjusts its workforce.

⚠️ A key risk is funding quality, with 65% of liabilities coming from higher risk sources alongside relatively high bad loans and a low allowance for those loans.

WeShop Holdings (WSHP) partners with Best Buy (BBY, Financial) to integrate the ShareBack program, enhancing customer engagement through rewards.

Best Buy Co Inc is a leading consumer electronics retailer in the US, with a significant market share in North America.

Best Buy's financial metrics indicate a strong balance sheet but highlight challenges in revenue and margin growth.

WeShop Holdings (WSHP) has formed a significant retail partnership with Best Buy (BBY) alongside other major tech companies including Samsung and Lenovo. This collaboration is designed to enhance the shopping experience by integrating WeShop's ShareBack program, which rewards consumers with WePoints for their purchases at participating retailers. These points can potentially be converted into ownership stakes in WeShop, promoting a community-focused ownership model.

Through this initiative, shoppers can earn WePoints while purchasing electronics like TVs, laptops, and audio systems. This approach not only enhances customer engagement but also aligns consumer purchases with the opportunity for equity participation in WeShop. The collaboration with Best Buy (BBY, Financial) serves as a crucial component of WeShop's strategy to redefine how customers interact with retail and investment.

Best Buy Co Inc, with over $41 billion in consolidated 2024 sales, stands as the largest pure-play consumer electronics retailer in the US, commanding roughly 8% of the North American market and about 33% of offline sales in the region. The company's primary revenue streams include mobile phones, tablets, computers, and appliances. Recent strategic investments in e-commerce fulfillment have doubled the US e-commerce channel from pre-pandemic levels, with expectations to maintain a mid-30% proportion of sales moving forward.

Best Buy operates within the Consumer Cyclical sector and the Retail - Cyclical industry, boasting a market capitalization of $13.77 billion. The company's stock is traded on the NYSE under the ticker BBY.

Balance Sheet Strength: The current ratio is 1.05, indicating adequate liquidity. However, the debt-to-equity ratio of 1.54 suggests a higher reliance on debt financing.

Warning Signs: The Altman Z-Score of 3.49 indicates strong financial health, while the Beneish M-Score of -2.76 suggests the company is unlikely to be a manipulator.

CoStar's stock price rose more than 6% in early trading as investors digested Third Point's plans.

Loeb has said the majority of CoStar's directors need to be replaced to help cut costs - including the CEO's compensation - and focus on boosting the share price, according to the letter.

Third Point wants the real estate data company to focus on its core commercial business and shut down or sell ‌its residential operation.

CoStar, which has a market capitalization of $28 billion, offers proprietary information and analytics to real estate developers and tenants.

Several years ago, ​it expanded into residential real estate to compete with market leader Zillow Group.

Loeb's plans for a board fight are emerging just hours after a standstill agreement - signed last year and designed to keep the hedge fund from airing its complaints publicly - expired at midnight.

For years, Loeb shocked and delighted Wall Street with harsh assessments of corporate America while pushing companies including ‍Walt Disney (DIS.N), opens new tab, Intel (INTC.O), opens new tab and Campbell's (CPB.O), opens new tab to perform better. Now he is taking aim at CoStar CEO Andy Florance and his decision to spend billions of dollars to expand into online classifieds in the residential real estate industry.

Earlier this month, CoStar said it expected to reduce its net investment in Homes.com by about $100 million a year until 2030. The company also unveiled a new $1.5 billion share repurchase plan, but did ⁠not provide details like when it will occur.

“We enter 2026 with considerable momentum and a clear plan to continue building our core platforms while scaling Homes.com, which is a ‍critical component to our comprehensive digital real estate platform and next chapter of profitable growth,"" a CoStar representative said by email.

""Our 2026 and long-term guidance – which represents sustained, accelerated revenue growth and margin expansion – ‌reflected the ‌Board’s confidence in our ability to enhance stockholder value,"" he added saying the company intends to continue to engage with shareholders, including Third Point.

In the letter, Loeb compared Florance to a young child who wins a prize for finishing last, calling the CEO's bonuses the ""costliest participation award"" he has ever seen, the sources said. By trying to make Homes.com compete with Zillow without offering a significantly different product, Florance and the board are responsible for a 27% drop in the stock price over the course of five years while the broader S&P ⁠500 stock index surged 94%, Loeb wrote in ⁠the letter.

Loeb said he wants new CoStar directors who ​can impose discipline on the CEO, reverse years of heavy spending and restore investor trust.

Third Point is sure that CoStar's core business, CoStar Suite, has room to improve its revenue if it raised prices and targeted investors and international customers, the letter said.

Third Point ranks among CoStar's 15 largest investors and has been engaging with the company for some time.

Last year it reached a settlement with CoStar, ‍paving the way for John Berisford, a former president of S&P Global Ratings, to join the board. At the same time, hedge fund DE Shaw also reached a settlement which allowed former Disney Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy to become a director. Etsy's ex-finance chief Rachel Glaser also joined the board.

The Third Point and DE Shaw directors joined a newly created four-person capital allocation committee, raising hopes among shareholders that the ​board and management might consider alternatives for the residential real estate business.

Loeb has been frustrated by a lack ‍of progress and a slide in CoStar's share price, which fell 14% over the past year to close at $65.81 on Monday. By mid-morning on Tuesday, the stock price traded at $68.41.

For Third Point, which oversees $24 billion in assets, the planned CoStar ​campaign marks a return to activism as more investors employ aggressive tactics and urge companies to sell all or parts of themselves.

Advertising Strategies in the U.S. Pharmaceutical Market

By Harshita Mary Varghese and Patrick Wingrove

Novo's Advertising Investment

Jan 28 (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk spent nearly $500 million on U.S. advertising for its GLP-1 drugs Wegovy and Ozempic in the first nine months of 2025, more than double what Eli Lilly shelled out for its rival medicines, as the Danish drugmaker fought for market share, data seen by Reuters shows.

Eli Lilly's Market Position

The data from advertising tracking firm MediaRadar, which has not been previously reported, shows Novo spent an estimated $316 million advertising its weight-loss drug Wegovy in the U.S. and $169 million on diabetes medication Ozempic from January through September last year. That's up 54% and 44%, respectively from the same period in 2024.

Impact of Advertising on Consumer Choices

Indianapolis-based market leader Eli Lilly spent about $131 million advertising obesity treatment Zepbound in the same period versus $2 million in 2024. It spent $83 million promoting diabetes medicine Mounjaro.

Combined, Novo spent about $487 million and Lilly an estimated $214 million on U.S. ads for these drugs. The companies declined to comment on their advertising budgets.

It is not known how much Novo plans to spend on advertising its new pill version of Wegovy.

David Moore, Novo's executive vice president of U.S. operations, said the company plans to advertise the pill immediately and push sales through its cash-pay, direct-to-consumer channels.

Insurance coverage in the U.S. is uneven for these drugs, prompting many people to pay out‑of‑pocket for them.

ADVERTISING BLITZ REFLECTS AMPLE SUPPLY

The U.S. is unusual in allowing direct‑to‑consumer advertising of prescription medicines, a system that has been criticized as driving up already high U.S. medical costs.

AbbVie, for example, spent more than $850 million in advertising for arthritis drugs Skyrizi and Rinvoq in the first nine months of 2025. AbbVie declined to comment.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have tried to discourage drugmaker advertising with new disclosure rules.

Last year's advertising blitz reflects a shift in availability for the medicines that were in shortage for much of 2024, with the companies unable to meet unprecedented demand.

During the shortage, Novo halted its ads and then ramped them up in 2025 as supply increased, Moore said.

Also, data released by Lilly in late 2024 showed patients taking Zepbound lost 47% more weight than those who were given Wegovy in a large, head-to-head trial.

""When it comes to weight loss, Lilly has that edge with Zepbound, which is why, likely, Novo is looking to offset that with higher advertising investments,"" Rajiv Leventhal, senior analyst for digital health at market research firm Emarketer.

A Lilly spokesperson said the company is committed to providing information across multiple channels to ensure consumers receive accurate, timely information about its drugs.

U.S. prescriptions for Zepbound overtook Wegovy last year, giving the U.S. drugmaker about 60% of the obesity drug market for 2025, according to IQVIA data shared by a Wall Street analyst. IQVIA did not respond to a request for comment.

Novo and Lilly have also had to deal with telehealth companies selling compounded copies of their drugs. They were able to freely sell their copies while the branded versions were in short supply, but have since turned to selling personalized doses that differ from what the pharmaceutical companies offer in dose size and regimen.

Rae McMahan, senior vice president of payer solutions at Prescryptive, which helps patients find the lowest prices for drugs at pharmacies, said advertising has limits in guiding treatment decisions for the GLP-1 drugs.

""It's still a conversation that needs to be between the patient and their physician,"" McMahan said.

The Uber effect Autonomous vehicles are a potential threat to Uber, which abandoned an earlier effort to develop its own self-driving technology in-house.
Yes, but: There are many unanswered questions about the Waabi/Uber robotaxi effort.
Uber sold ATG in 2020 to Aurora Innovation, another AV company working on autonomous trucks.
The bottom line: After years of hype, autonomous trucks and robotaxis are leading the way to the next phase of artificial intelligence.","A robot trained to drive an 18-wheeler can now drive a taxi, too, says Waabi — a Canadian autonomous trucking startup that just secured up to $1 billion from investors, including Uber.

Why it matters: Waabi says it's the first company to develop a shared AI ""brain"" that can operate both trucks and robotaxis — and eventually, other types of physical AI such as drones, warehouse robotics and humanoids.

""It's obvious that the physical AI moment is here,"" Waabi founder and CEO Raquel Urtasun tells Axios. ""Autonomy is the first application where scale is going to happen.""

Driving the news: The funding includes $750 million in a Series C round, plus a $250 million milestone-based commitment from Uber tied to a robotaxi partnership.

State of play: Uber's backing gives the new entrant instant weight in the race with Waymo, Tesla and overseas rivals to deploy driverless cabs.

As part of the agreement, Waabi has agreed to deploy at least 25,000 robotaxis powered by its driver system exclusively on Uber's global ride-hailing network.

The Uber effect

Autonomous vehicles are a potential threat to Uber, which abandoned an earlier effort to develop its own self-driving technology in-house.

Instead, it opted to partner with more than 20 AV companies worldwide to deploy small AV fleets alongside human drivers on its network.

Between the lines: The Waabi deal, and a similar deal with Nuro and Lucid for 20,000 robotaxis, represents an escalation of Uber's strategy.

By committing to deploy tens of thousands of AVs worldwide, Uber is signaling it plans to strongly defend its ride-hailing turf.

Yes, but: There are many unanswered questions about the Waabi/Uber robotaxi effort.

Waabi will supply the robot ""driver,"" but it's not clear what vehicles will be used.

In the Nuro-Lucid deal, Uber agreed to buy 20,000 Lucid electric robotaxis over six years and pay Nuro a per-mile licensing fee for its robot driver.

There is no such vehicle purchase agreement with Waabi yet.

It's also not known where and when Waabi's robotaxis will be deployed, and what the performance milestones are in order to unlock Uber's funding.

The backstory

Uber has had a stake in Waabi since its founding in 2021 by Urtasun, an AI pioneer who was previously chief scientist for Uber's Advanced Technologies Group.

Uber sold ATG in 2020 to Aurora Innovation, another AV company working on autonomous trucks.

Uber now has a stake in both Aurora and Waabi, which has a 10-year deal to autonomously haul cargo on the Uber Freight network.

The intrigue: Waabi's early AV efforts in Texas focused on a hub-to-hub model, in which automated trucks would drive only on the highway and then hand off to a human driver for local delivery.

But logistics companies complained that system just added costs and friction to their operations.

So Waabi trained the trucks to master surface streets, too, so they could deliver cargo directly to the customer's final location.

That street-level training, using self-learning AI technology, is what opened the door to urban robotaxis, Urtasun tells Axios.

""We've been pretty upfront for the last year and a half that our vision was to do more than self-driving trucks. We plan to do physical AI. Now it makes total sense for us to go to robotaxis next. Think about all the potential verticals you can do. This is ripe for scale.""

The bottom line: After years of hype, autonomous trucks and robotaxis are leading the way to the next phase of artificial intelligence.",https://images.axios.com/yS0rv3oUol04XftOHFUUYA389JA=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2026/01/27/1769549503866.jpeg,N,,2026-01-28 08:01:17.155569

The services include trading, custody, lending, and indirect exposure products. The research reviewed Bitcoin activity among banks ranked by total assets. It tracked custody services, trading access, and related client offerings.

The findings show a clear move toward Bitcoin after years of hesitation. Banks previously limited crypto exposure due to regulatory and reputational concerns.

Major Banks Expand Bitcoin Access

Several systemically important banks now offer Bitcoin-related services to select clients. JPMorgan Chase announced plans to add Bitcoin trading services. Wells Fargo provides Bitcoin-backed loans to institutional clients. Citigroup is exploring Bitcoin custody services for its customers. These three banks manage more than $7.3 trillion in combined assets.

Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley offer Bitcoin exposure to wealthy clients. Their services focus on high-net-worth and institutional investors. U.S. Bank and BNY Mellon provide Bitcoin custody to select customers. They rank among the earliest large banks to enter crypto safekeeping.

PNC Group launched both Bitcoin trading and custody services. This move sets PNC apart from many peers. State Street and HSBC’s U.S. units announced custody plans. Charles Schwab and UBS confirmed Bitcoin trading initiatives.

Swiss banking giant UBS also operates in the U.S. market. Bloomberg reported UBS plans Bitcoin and Ethereum trading for wealthy clients. This move marked the latest addition to River’s tracking list.

Momentum Grows Despite Holdouts

Several banks remain in early research or assessment stages. Citigroup and Fifth Third continue to study custody and trading models. Some institutions offer indirect Bitcoin exposure instead. American Express supports a Bitcoin rewards credit card.

USAA allows crypto access through exchange integrations. These steps expand access without direct custody involvement. Despite growing momentum, some major banks still stay on the sidelines. River identified nine banks without announced Bitcoin plans.

These include Bank of America, Capital One, and Truist Financial. TD Bank U.S., BMO Financial U.S., and First Citizens also appear. Citizens Financial, M&T Bank, and Huntington Bank round out the list. Barclays U.S. also has not disclosed Bitcoin service plans.

Bank of America holds $2.67 trillion in assets. Capital One manages $694 billion, while Truist controls $536 billion.

Still, even cautious banks show softer attitudes toward Bitcoin. Bank of America recently advised limited crypto exposure. The bank suggested clients allocate up to 4% of portfolios to cryptocurrencies. It also plans coverage of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. These ETFs include products from BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, and Bitwise.

Industry leaders echoed this shift during the Davos forum. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong spoke with banking executives at the event. Armstrong said most executives now see crypto as a business opportunity. One global bank CEO described crypto as an existential issue.

The Davos World Economic Forum ran from January 19 to January 23. Discussions highlighted growing competition between banks and crypto firms. Banks previously faced criticism during Operation Chokepoint 2.0 claims. That period involved alleged limits on crypto firm banking access.

The current expansion marks a clear reversal from that stance. However, banks remain cautious about yield-bearing stablecoins. They cite concerns about financial stability and systemic risk. Bitcoin adoption continues to advance despite those reservations.",,N,,2026-01-28 10:29:24.665813

The Register has asked HMRC if the ""direct award"" contract means it will once again go to Capgemini uncontested.
In 2024-25, HMRC spent £1.16 billion on IT and telecoms while collecting £858.9 billion in tax.","The UK's tax collector is budgeting to spend more than £2 billion on new tech deals in the next couple of years, including a contract set for AWS and another for Capgemini to be awarded without competition.

According to a spreadsheet of the procurement pipeline for this year and next, His Majesty's Revenue & Customs (HMRC) is starting with a data warehouse transformation program with a contract value estimated at £410 million.

The document says: ""HMRC intends to procure a single contract to deliver the transformation of its Legacy Data Warehouses (LDWs), combining existing run and change services with the migration and decommissioning of LDW platforms."" The planned procurement replaces no existing contract.

The legacy technology in question is most likely to be SAP ECC Business Warehouse, according to an earlier framework order. SAP is at the center of an ERP overhaul worth £246 million to the German vendor, which also won an award to upgrade the tax system technology in an uncontested deal worth £275 million.

The second-largest tech deal in the offing is for AWS Public Cloud Compute, with a value earmarked at £350 million. It is to replace an existing contract awarded to AWS for £350 million.

The third in terms of estimated value is ""Digital Platforms Run and Change Products,"" which asks for IT services to support application services including legacy live services. HMRC estimates this procurement will be worth up to £306 million. The winner will replace the current contract for ""Award of Digital Platforms Run (Platforms and Products),"" handed to Accenture in May 2024 for the same value.

There are four more procurements in the pipeline for more than £200 million in the next couple of years, including Mobility and Workplace services contract (support HMRC's devices including help desk for end users, £250 million), Digital Platforms Run and Change Platforms (IT services to support platform run applications for the Government Gateway, Multi-channel Digital Tax Platform, and Customer Insight Platform, £250 million), and Data Centre Services (£220 million).

Lastly, there is the Legacy - Retained HMRC Services Contract worth £214 million. HMRC promises this will be a ""direct award"" and will replace Core Business Platform Support and Maintenance Services, which was awarded to Capgemini for £214.5 million without prior publication of a call for competition. The French outsourcer later saw that deal extended without competition for another £107 million.

The Register has asked HMRC if the ""direct award"" contract means it will once again go to Capgemini uncontested.

Anthropic and OpenAI CEOs have been on the road, drumming up new investment to fund their ambitious expansion plans

For months now, America's tech sector has been beset by doubt and debate about the long-term viability of their business models. For OpenAI and Anthropic, however, two of the companies at the very forefront of AI's development and adoption, there are no qualms and they are accelerating investment into their businesses.

In the past few days, these two unlisted companies, fierce rivals with their ChatGPT and Claude flagship products, both of whom are reportedly considering going public in 2026, have been looking to secure new funding. Media speculation suggests OpenAI is seeking up to $100 billion while Anthropic is hoping to raise $20 billion.

Anthropic, helmed by founder and chief executive officer Dario Amodei, has outlined revenue guidance of $18 billion in 2026, $55 billion in 2027 and $148 billion by 2029, according to The Information in the course of wooing venture capitalists. The Financial Times reported that, owing to high interest, it had doubled the amount it had originally earmarked. At the same time, though, Amodei pushed back the timeline for going cash positive to 2028.

Investors have been drawn to Anthropic primarily because of its reputation as a provider of AI to business users and the favorable reviews garnered by its Claude chatbot. Among the list of high-profile investors in Anthropic are Sequoia Capital, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC.

OpenAI has been the subject of intense scrutiny since its co-founder and chief executive Sam Altman issued a Code Red warning to staff highlighting concerns about costs, competition and subscription rates. Nonetheless, despite this uncertainty, OpenAI's latest funding round is suggesting a valuation that could be as high as $830 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.

This is a dramatic uplift on the last reported transaction as recently as October which suggested a valuation of $500 billion. At the center of the latest investment influx is Japan's SoftBank (JP:9984) which has been increasing its stake in OpenAI and as recently as December injected $41 billion to bump it to 11%. In November, SoftBank fully divested all its shares in Nvidia for $5.8 billion, intending to reallocate the capital to OpenAI.

An indication of the funding commitment required by OpenAI.

According to industry reports, Altman is facing a funding requirement of $1.4 trillion by 2033, hence the urgency in finding new investors.

Over the past 60 years, with Buffett at the helm, Berkshire Hathaway has been one of the most reliable, best-performing stocks you can buy. In that time, the stock has beaten the S&P 500 (^GSPC +0.41%) in just about every time period you can imagine -- including five years, 10 years, 20 years, 30 years ... even 40 years.

And over the past 20 years, there were only three years when Berkshire Hathaway stock had a negative calendar-year return -- 2015, 2011, and 2008.

But if you look at the stock's analyst ratings right now, their views are mixed on Berkshire Hathaway. Among the analysts covering it, 57% rate it a hold, 29% a buy, and 14% a sell. The median price target for the B shares is $481 per share, which is basically where it's at now -- suggesting a flat return over the next 12 months.

In many respects, it's pretty surprising, but then again, the company is in the midst of a major transition, as Buffett retired in January and Greg Abel became the new CEO. Here's why this matters to investors.

There are a few reasons for the recent downturn, starting with the transition from Buffett to Abel. Quite simply, the Buffett premium that investors baked into their expectations, based on his track record, is probably not there for most investors with Abel at the helm, at least not yet.

I think this is a bit overblown -- in fact, I'm looking forward to some significant changes in a portfolio that has been extremely conservative in recent years.

Buffett had been selling off shares and hoarding cash, perhaps anticipating a massive downturn. But that left a record $382 billion sitting on the sidelines. That dwarfs the size of the $267 billion Berkshire portfolio.

A lot of that was moved into Treasury bills, and with interest rates likely to continue falling, that could create headwinds in the form of lower returns.

Berkshire Hathaway is now in Abel hands

I suspect that Buffett was likely stockpiling cash to let Abel and his team deploy it, knowing that he was leaving at the end of the year.

We've already had some indication that Abel may be making a major move by dumping Kraft Heinz (KHC +0.51%) stock, per an SEC filing by Kraft Heinz. Kraft Heinz is the ninth-largest position in the Berkshire portfolio and has long underperformed.

The mixed feelings on Berkshire Hathaway may, in fact, present a good opportunity for investors to buy the stock on the cheap, as it is trading at just 15 times earnings.

Abel and company have a lot of dry powder that they have probably been itching to deploy, and with more than 20 years at the right hand of the Oracle of Omaha, my guess is he'll know how to use it.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F849956%2Fgettyimages-168580604.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-28 08:01:09.877661

Walmart Builds New Customer Touchpoints With Dunkin MLS And Storm Support

January 28, 2026

Walmart (NasdaqGS:WMT) has opened its first in store Dunkin’ location in San Antonio, bringing a new food and beverage option directly into the retail experience.

The company has entered a new multi year partnership with Major League Soccer to launch the ""Walmart Saturday Showdown"" and expand its presence with US sports fans.

Walmart has also supported customers during Winter Storm Fern by focusing on access to essentials and disaster related assistance.

For investors watching NasdaqGS:WMT, these moves sit at the intersection of retail, entertainment, and community support. In store Dunkin’ locations echo what some competitors already offer with coffee chains or quick service restaurants, while the MLS partnership gives Walmart fresh exposure to a broad, younger fan base. The operational focus during Winter Storm Fern shows how the company looks to keep core goods available when local conditions are stressed.

Looking ahead, you can think of these developments as part of Walmart’s effort to make stores more of a destination and not just a weekly errand. How effectively the Dunkin’ rollout, MLS tie up, and severe weather playbook resonate with shoppers could influence how the company allocates capital between in store experiences, marketing partnerships, and logistics in the future.

Walmart narrative gets another chapter

Recent commentary already frames Walmart as an omnichannel retailer that leans on store fulfillment, e commerce, advertising, and membership. This news sits neatly in that story. Coffee, sports tie ins, and crisis response all give management more ways to reinforce the idea of Walmart as a default destination for budget conscious shoppers who still want breadth of choice and convenience.

Risks and rewards to keep in mind

🎁 These initiatives may support Walmart’s reputation as the go to value retailer at a time when inflation is pushing more consumers toward discount formats.

🎁 Deeper partnerships with brands, from Dunkin’ to beauty and personal care labels, could make better use of Walmart’s large store base and marketplace traffic.

⚠️ Execution risk exists if in store concepts, sports partnerships, or storm response efforts add costs without clear evidence of stronger customer satisfaction, especially given recent survey rankings.

⚠️ Investors also need to watch how much capital and management attention these programs require compared with core store operations and logistics.

What to watch next

From here, the key questions are how quickly Walmart scales the Dunkin’ concept, how visible the MLS partnership becomes to regular shoppers, and whether service focused efforts start to narrow the gap between financial results and low customer satisfaction scores.

Contingent Income Auto-Callable Securities due January 28, 2027

Based on the Performance of the Common Stock of Apple Inc.

Principal at Risk Securities

Unlike conventional debt securities, the securities do not guarantee the payment of interest or the return of the full principal amount at maturity. Instead, the securities offer the opportunity for investors to receive on the related contingent payment date a contingent quarterly payment equal to 2.5125% of the stated principal amount, plus all previously unpaid contingent quarterly payments, if any, if on any determination date the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to 80% of the initial underlier value, which we refer to as the downside threshold level. If the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to the initial underlier value on any determination date (other than the final determination date), the securities will be automatically redeemed for an amount per security equal to the stated principal amount plus the contingent quarterly payment and any unpaid contingent quarterly payments otherwise due. However, if on any determination date the closing price of the underlier is less than the initial underlier value, the securities will not be redeemed and if that closing price is less than the downside threshold level, investors will not receive the contingent quarterly payment applicable to that determination date on the related contingent payment date. If the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level, the payment at maturity due on the securities will be equal to the stated principal amount plus the contingent quarterly payment and any unpaid contingent quarterly payments otherwise due. However, if the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value is less than the downside threshold level, at maturity investors will lose 1% of the stated principal amount for every 1% that the final underlier value is less than the initial underlier value. Under these circumstances, the amount investors receive will be less than 80% of the stated principal amount and could be zero. The securities are for investors who are willing and able to risk their principal and forgo guaranteed interest payments, in exchange for the opportunity to potentially receive contingent quarterly payments at an above-market rate, subject to automatic early redemption. Investors will not participate in any appreciation of the underlier even though investors will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the underlier if the securities have not been redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value is less than the downside threshold level. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Barclays Bank PLC. Any payment on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and is not guaranteed by any third party. If Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its payment obligations or become subject to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power (as described on page 5 of this document) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority, you might not receive any amounts owed to you under the securities. See “Risk Factors” and “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document and “Risk Factors” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

FINAL TERMS* Issuer: Barclays Bank PLC Reference asset: Apple Inc. common stock (Bloomberg ticker symbol “AAPL UW<Equity>”) (the “underlier”) Aggregate principal amount: $10,527,000 Stated principal amount: $1,000 per security Pricing date: January 23, 2026 Original issue date: January 28, 2026 Maturity date†: January 28, 2027 Automatic early redemption: If, on any determination date (other than the final determination date), the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to the initial underlier value, the securities will be automatically redeemed for an early redemption payment on the contingent payment date immediately following that determination date. The securities will not be redeemed early if the closing price of the underlier is less than the initial underlier value on the related determination date. No further payments will be made on the securities after they have been redeemed. Early redemption payment: The early redemption payment will be an amount per security equal to (i) the stated principal amount plus (ii) the contingent quarterly payment and any unpaid contingent quarterly payments otherwise due. Contingent quarterly payment:

· If, on any determination date, the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level, we will pay on the related contingent payment date a contingent quarterly payment of $25.125 (2.5125% of the stated principal amount) per security, plus the amounts of all contingent quarterly payments, if any, that would have been paid on a previous contingent payment date had the closing price of the underlier been greater than or equal to the downside threshold level on the related determination date and that have not been previously paid (“unpaid contingent quarterly payments”).

· If, on any determination date, the closing price of the underlier is less than the downside threshold level, the contingent quarterly payment applicable to that determination date will not be payable on the related contingent payment date.

The closing price of the underlier could be below the downside threshold level on most or all of the determination dates so that you receive few or no contingent quarterly payments over the term of the securities.

Payment at maturity:

If the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, you will receive on the maturity date a cash payment per security determined as follows:

· If the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level:

(i) stated principal amount plus (ii) the contingent quarterly payment and any unpaid contingent quarterly payments otherwise due

· If the final underlier value is less than the downside threshold level:

stated principal amount × underlier performance factor

Under these circumstances, the payment at maturity will be less than the stated principal amount of $1,000 and will represent a loss of more than 20%, and possibly all, of an investor’s principal amount. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the securities. Any payment on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

U.K. Bail-in Power acknowledgment: Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” on page 5 of this document. Downside threshold level: $198.43, which is equal to 80% of the initial underlier value (rounded to two decimal places) Initial underlier value: $248.04, which is the closing price of the underlier on the pricing date Final underlier value: The closing price of the underlier on the final determination date Underlier performance factor: final underlier value / initial underlier value (terms continued on the next page)

(1)Our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date, based on our internal pricing models, is $978.40 per security.

(3)Reflects a structuring fee payable to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management by the agent or its affiliates of $5.00 for each security.

One or more of our affiliates may purchase up to 15% of the aggregate principal amount of the securities and hold such securities for investment for a period of at least 30 days. Accordingly, the total principal amount of the securities may include a portion that was not purchased by investors on the original issue date. Any unsold portion held by our affiliate(s) may affect the supply of securities available for secondary trading and, therefore, could adversely affect the price of the securities in the secondary market. Circumstances may occur in which our interests or those of our affiliates could be in conflict with your interests.

Investing in the securities involves risks not associated with an investment in conventional debt securities. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 12 of this document and beginning on page S-9 of the prospectus supplement.

In connection with this offering, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is acting in its capacity as a selected dealer.

Additional Information Regarding Our Estimated Value of the Securities

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the pricing date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the securities might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date is less than the initial issue price of the securities. The difference between the initial issue price of the securities and our estimated value of the securities results from several factors, including any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities. These other costs will include a fee paid to LFT Securities, LLC, an entity in which an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management has an ownership interest, for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.

Our estimated value on the pricing date is not a prediction of the price at which the securities may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the securities in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the pricing date for a temporary period expected to be approximately 40 days after the initial issue date of the securities because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the securities and other costs in connection with the securities that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the securities. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the securities and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the securities. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the securities based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read “Risk Factors” beginning on page 12 of this document.

Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the securities into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the securities of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the securities and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the securities, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the securities, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the securities solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the securities further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the securities are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the securities may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. bail-in power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in this document as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Investment Summary

Contingent Income Auto-Callable Securities

Principal at Risk Securities

The Contingent Income Auto-Callable Securities due January 28, 2027 Based on the Performance of the Common Stock of Apple Inc., which we refer to as the securities, provide an opportunity for investors to receive on the related contingent payment date a contingent quarterly payment, which is an amount equal to $25.125 (2.5125% of the stated principal amount), plus all previously unpaid contingent quarterly payments, if any, if on any determination date the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to 80% of the initial underlier value, which we refer to as the downside threshold level. However, if the closing price of the underlier is less than the downside threshold level on a determination date, investors will not receive the contingent quarterly payment applicable to that determination date on the related contingent payment date. The closing price of the underlier could be below the downside threshold level on most or all of the determination dates so that you receive few or no contingent quarterly payments over the term of the securities.

If the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to the initial underlier value on any determination date (other than the final determination date), the securities will be automatically redeemed for an early redemption payment equal to the stated principal amount plus the contingent quarterly payment and any unpaid contingent quarterly payments otherwise due. If the securities are automatically redeemed prior to maturity, investors will receive no further contingent quarterly payments. At maturity, if the securities have not previously been redeemed and the final underlier value is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level, the payment at maturity will be equal to the stated principal amount plus the contingent quarterly payment and any unpaid contingent quarterly payments otherwise due. However, if the securities have not previously been redeemed and the final underlier value is less than the downside threshold level, investors will lose 1% of the stated principal amount for every 1% that the final underlier value is less than the initial underlier value. Under these circumstances, the amount investors receive will be less than 80% of the stated principal amount and could be zero. Investors in the securities must be willing and able to accept the risk of losing their entire initial investment and also the risk of not receiving any contingent quarterly payment throughout the entire term of the securities. In addition, investors will not participate in any appreciation of the underlier.

Key Investment Rationale

The securities are for investors who are willing and able to risk their principal and forgo guaranteed interest payments, in exchange for the opportunity to potentially receive contingent quarterly payments at an above-market rate, subject to automatic early redemption. The securities offer investors an opportunity to receive on the related contingent payment date a contingent quarterly payment of $25.125 (2.5125% of the stated principal amount), plus all previously unpaid contingent quarterly payments, if any, if on any determination date the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level. In addition, the following scenarios reflect the potential payment on the securities, if any, upon an automatic early redemption or at maturity:

Selected Purchase Considerations

The securities are not appropriate for all investors. The securities may be an appropriate investment for you if all of the following statements are true:

§You do not seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income.

§You do not anticipate that the final underlier value will be less than the downside threshold level on the final determination date, and you are willing and able to accept the risk that, if it is, you will lose a significant portion or all of the stated principal amount.

§You do not anticipate that the closing price of the underlier will be less than the downside threshold level on any determination date, and you are willing and able to accept the risk that, if it is, you may receive few or no contingent quarterly payments over the term of the securities.

§You are willing and able to forgo participation in any appreciation of the underlier, and you understand that any return on your investment will be limited to the contingent quarterly payments that may be payable on the securities.

§You are willing and able to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the underlier, as explained in more detail in the “Risk Factors” section of this document.

§You understand and accept that you will not be entitled to receive dividends or distributions that may be paid to holders of the underlier, nor will you have any voting rights with respect to the issuer of the underlier.

§You are willing and able to accept the risk that the securities may be automatically redeemed prior to scheduled maturity and that you may not be able to reinvest your money in an alternative investment with comparable risk and yield.

§You do not seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market and you are willing and able to hold the securities to maturity if the securities are not automatically redeemed.

§You are willing and able to assume our credit risk for all payments on the securities.

§You are willing and able to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

The securities may not be an appropriate investment for you if any of the following statements are true:

§You seek an investment that produces fixed periodic interest or coupon payments or other non-contingent sources of current income.

§You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity.

§You anticipate that the final underlier value will be less than the downside threshold level on the final determination date, or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that, if it is, you will lose a significant portion or all of the stated principal amount.

§You anticipate that the closing price of the underlier will be less than the downside threshold level on some or all of the determination dates, or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that, if it is, you may receive few or no contingent quarterly payments over the term of the securities.

§You seek exposure to any upside performance of the underlier or you seek an investment with a return that is not limited to the contingent quarterly payments that may be payable on the securities.

§You are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the underlier, as explained in more detail in the “Risk Factors” section of this document.

§You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to, the underlier.

§You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the securities may be automatically redeemed prior to scheduled maturity.

§You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the securities to maturity if they are not automatically redeemed.

§You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the securities.

§You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the securities. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the securities after carefully considering, with your advisors, the appropriateness of the securities in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set forth in this document, the prospectus and the prospectus supplement. Neither the issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the appropriateness of the securities for investment.

How the Securities Work

The following diagrams illustrate the potential outcomes for the securities depending on the closing price of the underlier on the determination dates.

Diagram #1: Determination Dates Prior to the Final Determination Date

Diagram #2: Payment at Maturity If No Automatic Early Redemption Occurs

For more information about the payment upon an automatic early redemption or at maturity in different hypothetical scenarios, see “Hypothetical Examples” below.

Hypothetical Examples

The numbers appearing in the following examples may have been rounded for ease of analysis. The examples below assume that the securities will be held until maturity or earlier redemption and do not take into account the tax consequences of an investment in the securities. The examples below are based on the following terms:*

Hypothetical Initial Underlier Value: $100.00 Hypothetical Downside Threshold Level: $80.00, which is 80% of the hypothetical initial underlier value Contingent Quarterly Payment: $25.125 (2.5125% of the stated principal amount) Stated Principal Amount: $1,000 per security

* Terms used for purposes of these hypothetical examples do not represent the actual initial underlier value or downside threshold level applicable to the securities. In particular, the hypothetical initial underlier value of $100.00 used in these examples has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the actual initial underlier value. Please see “Apple Inc. Overview” below for recent actual values of the underlier. The actual initial underlier value and downside threshold level applicable to the securities are set forth on the cover page of this document.

In Examples 1 and 2, the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to the hypothetical initial underlier value of $100.00 on one of the determination dates prior to the final determination date. Because the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to the initial underlier value on one of the determination dates prior to the final determination date, the securities are automatically redeemed following the relevant determination date. In Examples 3 and 4, the closing price of the underlier on the determination dates prior to the final determination date is less than the initial underlier value, and, consequently, the securities are not automatically redeemed prior to, and remain outstanding until, maturity.

* If the securities are automatically redeemed, the early redemption payment will include the contingent quarterly payment and any unpaid contingent quarterly payments otherwise due.

In Example 1, the securities are automatically redeemed following the second determination date, as the closing price of the underlier on the second determination date is greater than or equal to the initial underlier value. Because the closing price of the underlier is less than the downside threshold level on the first determination date, you will not receive the contingent quarterly payment applicable to that determination date on the related contingent payment date. Following the second determination date, you receive the stated principal amount plus the contingent quarterly payment and the unpaid contingent quarterly payment otherwise due. Accordingly, the contingent quarterly payment that would have been paid on the first contingent payment date had the closing price of the underlier been greater than or equal to the downside threshold level on that determination date will be paid following the second determination date. You will receive the early redemption payment, calculated as follows:

stated principal amount + contingent quarterly payment + unpaid contingent quarterly payment(s)

= $1,000 + $25.125 + ($25.125 × 1) = $1,050.25

In this example, the automatic early redemption feature limits the term of your investment to approximately 6 months and you may not be able to reinvest at comparable terms or returns. If the securities are redeemed early, you will stop receiving contingent quarterly payments.

In Example 2, the securities are automatically redeemed following the third determination date, as the closing price of the underlier on the third determination date is greater than the initial underlier value. As the closing price of the underlier on the first determination date is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level, you receive the contingent quarterly payment of $25.125 with respect to that determination date. Because the closing price of the underlier is less than the downside threshold level on the second determination date, you will not receive the contingent quarterly payment applicable to that determination date on the related contingent payment date; however, because the closing price of the underlier on the third determination date is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level, the contingent quarterly payment that would have been paid on the second contingent payment date had the closing price of the underlier been greater than or equal to the downside threshold level on that determination date will be paid on the third contingent payment date. Following the third determination date, you receive an early redemption payment of $1,050.25, which includes the contingent quarterly payment and the unpaid contingent quarterly payment otherwise due.

In this example, the automatic early redemption feature limits the term of your investment to approximately 9 months and you may not be able to reinvest at comparable terms or returns. If the securities are redeemed early, you will stop receiving contingent quarterly payments. Further, although the underlier has appreciated by 25% from the initial underlier value on the third determination date, upon automatic early redemption, you receive only $1,050.25 per security and do not benefit from such appreciation.

Examples 3 and 4 illustrate the payment at maturity per security based on the final underlier value.

In Example 3, the closing price of the underlier is below the downside threshold level on each determination date throughout the term of the securities. As a result, you do not receive any contingent quarterly payments during the term of the securities. In addition, because the final underlier value is less than the downside threshold level, at maturity, your initial investment is fully exposed to the decline in the closing price of the underlier. Thus, investors will receive a cash payment at maturity that is significantly less than the stated principal amount, calculated as follows:

$1,000 × underlier performance factor

= $1,000 × (final underlier value / initial underlier value)

= $1,000 × ($55.00 / $100.00)

= $550.00

In this example, the cash payment you receive at maturity is significantly less than the stated principal amount.

In Example 4, as the closing price of the underlier on the first determination date is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level, you receive the contingent quarterly payment of $25.125 with respect to that determination date. Because the closing price of the underlier is less than the downside threshold level on the second and third determination dates, you will not receive the contingent quarterly payments applicable to those determination dates on the related contingent payment dates. In addition, the closing price of the underlier decreases to a final underlier value of $90.00. Although the final underlier value is less than the initial underlier value, because the final underlier value is still not less than the downside threshold level, you receive the stated principal amount plus the contingent quarterly payment and the unpaid contingent quarterly payments otherwise due. Accordingly, the contingent quarterly payments that would have been paid on the second and third contingent payment dates had the closing price of the underlier been

greater than or equal to the downside threshold level on those determination dates will be paid on the maturity date. Your payment at maturity is calculated as follows:

stated principal amount + contingent quarterly payment + unpaid contingent quarterly payment(s)

= $1,000 + $25.125 + ($25.125 × 2) = $1,075.375

In this example, although the final underlier value represents a decline of 10% from the initial underlier value, you receive the stated principal amount plus the contingent quarterly payment and any unpaid contingent quarterly payments otherwise due, equal to a total payment of $1,075.375 per security at maturity.

Risk Factors

An investment in the securities involves significant risks. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the securities. Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing directly in the underlier. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the securities are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the securities generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the securities unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the securities.

Risks Relating to the Securities Generally

§The securities do not guarantee the return of any principal. The terms of the securities differ from those of ordinary debt securities in that the securities do not guarantee the return of any of the stated principal amount at maturity. Instead, if the securities have not been automatically redeemed prior to maturity and if the final underlier value is less than the downside threshold level, you will be exposed to the decline in the closing price of the underlier, as compared to the initial underlier value, on a 1-to-1 basis and you will receive for each security that you hold at maturity an amount in cash equal to the stated principal amount times the underlier performance factor. Under these circumstances, your payment at maturity will be less than 80% of the stated principal amount and could be zero.

§You may not receive some or all of the contingent quarterly payments. The securities differ from ordinary debt securities in that they do not provide for regular interest payments. Instead, a contingent quarterly payment, plus all previously unpaid contingent quarterly payments, if any, will be payable on the related contingent payment date if on any determination date the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level. If the closing price of the underlier is less than the downside threshold level on any determination date, we will not pay the contingent quarterly payment applicable to that determination date or any unpaid contingent quarterly payments on the related contingent payment date. If a contingent quarterly payment is not paid on any contingent payment date, that contingent quarterly payment will be paid as an unpaid contingent quarterly payment on a later contingent payment date only if the closing price of the underlier on a subsequent determination date is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level. The closing price of the underlier could be below the downside threshold level on most or all of the determination dates so that you receive few or no contingent quarterly payments over the term of the securities. If you do not receive sufficient contingent quarterly payments over the term of the securities, the overall return on the securities may be less than the amount that would be paid on a conventional debt security of the issuer of comparable maturity.

§Your potential return on the securities will be different depending on the sequence of closing prices on the determination dates. Depending on the sequence in which the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level on specific determination dates (if at all), you could receive a lesser or greater return, regardless of the number of determination dates on which the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level. For example, if the closing price of the underlier is less than the downside threshold level on each of the first three determination dates but is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level on the final determination date, you will receive four contingent quarterly payments (three in the form of unpaid contingent quarterly payments). However, if the closing price of the underlier is greater than or equal to the downside threshold level on each of the first two determination dates but on no subsequent determination dates, you will receive only two contingent quarterly payments, even though the closing price of the underlier was greater than or equal to the downside threshold level on twice as many determination dates than in the previous example.

§You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the underlier. You will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the underlier from the initial underlier value even though you will be exposed to the depreciation in the value of the underlier if the securities have not been redeemed prior to maturity and the final underlier value is less than the downside threshold level. The return on the securities will be limited to any contingent quarterly payments that are paid on the securities.

§Automatic early redemption risk. The term of your investment in the securities may be limited to as short as approximately three months by the automatic early redemption feature of the securities. If the securities are redeemed prior to maturity, no further contingent quarterly payments will be made on the securities and you may be forced to reinvest in a lower interest rate environment. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the securities in a comparable investment with a similar level of risk in the event the securities are redeemed prior to the maturity date.

§Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the closing prices of the underlier on the dates specified. Any payment on the securities will be determined based on the closing prices of the underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the underlier determined at any other time.

§Contingent repayment of principal applies only at maturity or upon any automatic early redemption. You should be willing and able to hold the securities to maturity or any automatic early redemption. If you sell the securities prior to maturity in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell the securities at a loss relative to your initial investment even if the price of the underlier is above the downside threshold level.

§The securities are subject to volatility risk. Volatility is a measure of the degree of variation in the price of the underlier over a period of time. The contingent quarterly payment is determined based on a number of factors, including the expected volatility of the underlier. The contingent quarterly payment is higher than the fixed rate that we would pay on a conventional

debt security of the same tenor and is higher than it otherwise would be if the level of expected volatility of the underlier taken into account in determining the terms of the securities were lower. As volatility of the underlier increases, there will typically be a greater likelihood that (a) the closing price of the underlier will be less than the downside threshold level on one or more determination dates and (b) the final underlier value will be less than the downside threshold level.

Accordingly, you should understand that a higher contingent quarterly payment reflects, among other things, an indication of a greater likelihood that you will (a) not receive contingent quarterly payments with respect to one or more determination dates and/or (b) incur a loss of principal at maturity than would have been the case had the contingent quarterly payment been lower. In addition, actual volatility over the term of the securities may be significantly higher than the expected volatility at the time the terms of the securities were determined. If actual volatility is higher than expected, you will face an even greater risk that you will not receive contingent quarterly payments and/or that you will lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity for the reasons described above.

§Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing in the underlier. Investors in the securities will not own the underlier or have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the underlier.

§Tax treatment. Significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation. See “Additional provisions—Tax considerations” below.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

§Credit of issuer. The securities are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the securities, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the securities and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the securities.

§You may lose some or all of your investment if any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the securities or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the securities (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the securities), by acquiring the securities, each holder or beneficial owner of the securities acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the securities losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the securities or receiving a different security from the securities, which may be worth significantly less than the securities and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the securities. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the securities. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this document as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier

§No affiliation with the issuer of the underlier. The issuer of the underlier is not an affiliate of ours, is not involved with this offering in any way, and has no obligation to consider your interests in taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of the securities. We have not made any due diligence inquiry with respect to the issuer of the underlier in connection with this offering.

§Single equity risk. The price of the underlier can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the underlier and its issuer, such as stock price volatility, earnings, financial conditions, corporate, industry and regulatory developments, management changes and decisions and other events, as well as general market factors, such as general stock market volatility and levels, interest rates and economic and political conditions. We urge you to review financial and other information filed periodically with the SEC by the issuer of the underlier.

§Anti-dilution protection is limited, and the calculation agent has discretion to make anti-dilution adjustments. The calculation agent may in its sole discretion make adjustments affecting the amounts payable on the securities upon the occurrence of certain corporate events (such as stock splits or extraordinary or special dividends) that the calculation agent determines have a diluting or concentrative effect on the theoretical value of the underlier. However, the calculation agent might not make such adjustments in response to all events that could affect the underlier. The occurrence of any such event

and any adjustment made by the calculation agent (or a determination by the calculation agent not to make any adjustment) may adversely affect the market price of, and any amounts payable on, the securities. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

§Reorganization or other events could adversely affect the value of the securities or result in the securities being accelerated. Upon the occurrence of certain reorganization events or a nationalization, expropriation, liquidation, bankruptcy, insolvency or de-listing of the underlier, the calculation agent may replace the underlier with shares of another company identified as described in the prospectus supplement or, in some cases, with shares, cash or other assets distributed to holders of the underlier upon the occurrence of that event. In the alternative, the calculation agent may accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the calculation agent or may make other changes to the terms of the securities to account for the occurrence of that event. Any decision by the calculation agent to replace the underlier, to accelerate the securities or to otherwise adjust the terms of the securities could adversely affect the value of, and any amount payable on, the securities, perhaps significantly, and could result in a significantly lower return on the securities than if the calculation agent had made a different decision. See “Reference Assets—Equity Securities—Share Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Equity Security as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

§Governmental legislative or regulatory actions, such as sanctions, could adversely affect your investment in the securities. Governmental legislative or regulatory actions, including, without limitation, sanctions-related actions by the U.S. or a foreign government, could prohibit or otherwise restrict persons from holding the securities or the underlier, or engaging in transactions in them, and any such action could adversely affect the value of the underlier. These legislative or regulatory actions could result in restrictions on the securities or the de-listing of the underlier. You may lose a significant portion or all of your initial investment in the securities if the underlier is de-listed or if you are forced to divest the securities due to government mandates, especially if such de-listing occurs or such divestment must be made at a time when the value of the securities has declined. See “—Reorganization or other events could adversely affect the value of the securities or result in the securities being accelerated” above.

§We may accelerate the securities if a change-in-law event occurs. Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the securities or the underlier, or engaging in transactions in them, the calculation agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the maturity date for a payment determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the securities if they were not accelerated. However, if the calculation agent elects not to accelerate the securities, the value of, and any amount payable on, the securities could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

§We may engage in business with or involving the issuer of the underlier without regard to your interests. We or our affiliates may presently or from time to time engage in business with the issuer of the underlier without regard to your interests and thus may acquire non-public information about the issuer of the underlier. Neither we nor any of our affiliates undertakes to disclose any such information to you. In addition, we or our affiliates from time to time have published and in the future may publish research reports with respect to the issuer of the underlier, which may or may not recommend that investors buy or hold the underlier.

§Hedging and trading activity by the issuer and its affiliates could potentially adversely affect the value of the securities. Hedging or trading activities of the issuer’s affiliates and of any other hedging counterparty with respect to the securities could adversely affect the value of the underlier and, as a result, could decrease the amount an investor may receive on the securities at maturity, if any. Any of these hedging or trading activities on or prior to the pricing date could have increased the initial underlier value and, as a result, the downside threshold level, which is the price at or above which the underlier must close on a determination date in order for you to receive a contingent quarterly payment and any unpaid contingent quarterly payments or, if the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, in order for you to avoid being exposed to the negative performance of the underlier at maturity. Additionally, such hedging or trading activities during the term of the securities could potentially affect the price of the underlier on the determination dates and, accordingly, whether investors will receive one or more contingent quarterly payments, whether the securities are automatically redeemed prior to maturity and, if the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity, the payment at maturity, if any.

§We and our affiliates, and any dealer participating in the distribution of the securities, may engage in various activities or make determinations that could materially affect your securities in various ways and create conflicts of interest. We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the securities, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the securities, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to

the underlier. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the securities. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the securities into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the securities.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the securities, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the securities. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the securities and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the securities instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the securities for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, the selected dealer or its affiliates will have the option to conduct a material portion of the hedging activities for us in connection with the securities. The selected dealer or its affiliates would expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit would be in addition to any selling concession that the selected dealer realizes for the sale of the securities to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the selected dealer to sell the securities to you.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the calculation agent for the securities. As calculation agent, we will determine any values of the underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the securities. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the securities.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Securities and the Secondary Market

§The securities will not be listed on any securities exchange, and secondary trading may be limited. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market but are not required to do so and may cease any such market making activities at any time, without notice. Even if a secondary market develops, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the securities, the price, if any, at which you may be able to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the securities. In addition, Barclays Capital Inc. or one or more of our other affiliates may at any time hold an unsold portion of the securities (as described on the cover page of this document), which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the securities. The securities are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your securities to maturity.

§The market price of the securities will be influenced by many unpredictable factors. Several factors will influence the value of the securities in the secondary market and the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC may be willing to purchase or sell the securities in the secondary market. Although we expect that generally the value of the underlier on any day will affect the value of the securities more than any other single factor, other factors that may influence the value of the securities include:

othe volatility (frequency and magnitude of changes in value) of the underlier;

owhether the closing price has been, or is expected to be, below the downside threshold level on any determination date;

odividend rates on the underlier;

ointerest and yield rates in the market;

osupply and demand for the securities;

ogeopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, regulatory and judicial events that affect the underlier and that may affect the final underlier value; and

oany actual or anticipated changes in our credit ratings or credit spreads.

The value of the underlier may be, and has recently been, volatile, and we can give you no assurance that the volatility will lessen. See “Apple Inc. Overview” below. You may receive less, and possibly significantly less, than the stated principal amount if you try to sell your securities prior to maturity.

§The estimated value of your securities is lower than the initial issue price of your securities. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is lower than the initial issue price of your securities. The difference between the initial issue price of your securities and the estimated value of the securities is a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the securities, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the securities, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the securities. These other costs will include a fee paid to LFT Securities, LLC, an entity in which an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management has an ownership interest, for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.

§The estimated value of your securities might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated value referenced above might be lower if such estimated value were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

§The estimated value of the securities is based on our internal pricing models, which may prove to be inaccurate and may be different from the pricing models of other financial institutions. The estimated value of your securities on the pricing date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the securities may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of securities in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your securities may be materially different from the estimated value of the securities determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

§The estimated value of your securities is not a prediction of the prices at which you may sell your securities in the secondary market, if any, and such secondary market prices, if any, will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your securities and may be lower than the estimated value of your securities. The estimated value of the securities will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your securities in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the securities. Further, as secondary market prices of your securities take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the securities such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the securities, secondary market prices of your securities will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your securities. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the securities from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your securities, and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

§The temporary price at which we may initially buy the securities in the secondary market and the value we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may not be indicative of future prices of your securities. Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the pricing date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the securities, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the securities on the pricing date, as well as the secondary market value of the securities, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the securities. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the securities in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your securities.

Jan 27 (Reuters) - OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told employees in an internal message that ICE is “going too far” with its immigration crackdown, becoming the latest corporate executive to voice concerns about heavy enforcement actions in Minnesota.

Federal agents shot and killed a protester in Minneapolis over the weekend, the second such shooting this month, sparking widespread disapproval of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s actions. More than 60 CEOs have signed a statement calling for de-escalation after weeks of silence.

“What’s happening with ICE is going too far,” Altman wrote in a Slack message to employees of the ChatGPT maker, a source familiar with the matter said. “There is a big difference between deporting violent criminals and what’s happening now, and we need to get the distinction right.”

Apple CEO Tim Cook also weighed in on the incident and said that he was “heartbroken” by the events in Minneapolis and called for “de-escalation,” Bloomberg reported later on Tuesday, citing an internal memo to employees.

Cook also said he had discussed the matter with U.S. President Donald Trump, according to the report. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.

“I love the U.S. and its values of democracy and freedom and will be supportive of the country however I can; OpenAI will too,” Altman said in his message, which was first reported by the New York Times’ DealBook. “But part of loving the country is the American duty to push back against overreach.”

Altman’s comments come as a rift has emerged at Khosla Ventures, an early OpenAI backer. Founder Vinod Khosla and partner Ethan Choi disavowed comments from partner Keith Rabois over the weekend that law enforcement had not shot an innocent person and that illegal immigrants commit crimes on a daily basis.

A number of businesses have been hesitant to criticize Trump during his second term.

Since the beginning of “Operation Metro Surge” in Minneapolis in December, major Minnesota corporations had been largely silent about the effects of the immigration enforcement efforts on the city, a liberal Midwestern stronghold as well as a major corporate hub.

Leaders of companies such as 3M, UnitedHealth Group and General Mills have called for de-escalation since the second shooting over the weekend.

More than 450 employees from firms like Google, Meta Platforms, Salesforce and OpenAI signed a letter on Saturday urging their top executives to pressure the White House to withdraw ICE from U.S. cities, cancel all contracts with ICE and to speak out publicly against ICE’s violence.

“President Trump is a very strong leader, and I hope he will rise to this moment and unite the country. I am encouraged by the last few hours of response and hope to see trust rebuilt with transparent investigations,” Altman added.

The approval allows MedPal to purchase and dispense Eli Lilly’s medicines, including Mounjaro (tirzepatide), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist used in type 2 diabetes and weight management.
The company said Mounjaro is the UK’s leading weight loss medication, with around 79% of the UK GLP-1 market.

The approval allows MedPal to purchase and dispense Eli Lilly’s medicines, including Mounjaro (tirzepatide), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist used in type 2 diabetes and weight management.

The company said Mounjaro is the UK’s leading weight loss medication, with around 79% of the UK GLP-1 market. It added that research indicates around ten times more people in the UK buy Mounjaro privately than receive it through the National Health Service (NHS), pointing to a large private prescribing opportunity.

MedPal also noted that Wegovy, which MedPal.clinic already supplies, represents 20% of the market. The company said access to both products should allow patients to choose their preferred GLP-1 option.

MedPal said the UK prescription weight loss medications market is forecast to grow from around £340 million in 2025 to £2 billion by 2033, and that an estimated 3.4 million people in the UK are eligible for tirzepatide treatment.

The company said dispensing will be handled from its robotic distribution centre in Swaffham, Norfolk, which it believes supports scalable fulfilment as demand grows.

MedPal AI’s CEO Jason Drummond said: ""Securing direct supply rights with Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of the UK's leading weight loss medication, is an important milestone for MedPal AI. Access to Mounjaro strengthens our ability to serve patients through MedPal.clinic, where our AI triage technology connects individuals with appropriate clinical pathways for weight management. With our robotic dispensing facility in Swaffham, we are well positioned to meet growing patient demand.""

Direct purchasing rights for Eli Lilly products look like a meaningful step for MedPal’s private weight management ambitions, particularly given the company’s focus on AI-led triage and its automated dispensing infrastructure.

Die massiven Schneefälle zu Wochenbeginn haben den Abfuhrplan der Abfallwirtschaft im Landkreis Bamberg erheblich durcheinander gewirbelt. Während die Sammeltouren am 26. und 27. Januar 2026 nicht gestartet werden konnten, haben die beauftragten Entsorgungsunternehmen nun kurzfristig mitgeteilt, dass auch im weiteren Wochenverlauf keine Behälterleerungen, Sperrmüllabholungen oder „Gelbe-Sack-Abfuhren“ stattfinden sollen.

Als Gründe wurden arbeitsschutzrechtliche Vorgaben, angekündigte neue Niederschläge sowie – vor allem in den „Nebenstraßen“ – sehr schwierige Fahrbahnverhältnisse angeführt. Darüber hinaus erschweren aktuell vielerorts die Schneeberge an den Straßenrändern ohnehin erheblich die Zufahrt, sodass mitunter die Sicherheit der Bediensteten und anderer Verkehrsteilnehmer oder Passanten nicht gewährleistet werden kann.

Somit ergeben sich für die betroffenen Haushalte fraktionsbezogen folgende Änderungen:

Biotonnen

Die Abfuhren für die Kalenderwochen 5 und 6/2026 terminierten Biotonnenleerungen entfallen. Da die Witterung Gartenarbeiten momentan ohnehin nicht ermöglicht, werden Kundinnen und Kunden gebeten, ihr Biogut über die Restkapazität der Biomülltonnen zu entsorgen. Der reguläre Bio-Sammelbetrieb soll gemäß Abfuhrplan wieder mit Wirkung vom 9. Februar 2026 aufgenommen werden.

Restmülltonnen

Die in der 5. Kalenderwoche 2026 entfallenen Leerungen werden in den jeweiligen Kommunen laut Planungsstand der Entsorgungsunternehmen in der 6. Kalenderwoche 2026 am entsprechenden eigentlichen Biotonnen-Abfuhrtag nachgeholt. Dies bedeutet im Überblick:

Frensdorf, Pommersfelden, Schlüsselfeld

In allen übrigen Landkreisgemeinden sollen die Restmüllabholungen der Kalenderwoche 6/2026 regulär – wie im Abfallkalender 2026 veröffentlicht – stattfinden.

Altpapier

Die Entleerung der Altpapierbehälter soll ab 2. Februar 2026 wieder aufgenommen werden. Haushalte, deren Altpapiertonnen in der Kalenderwoche 5/2026 nicht geleert werden konnten, werden gebeten, entweder mögliche Restkapazitäten ihrer Sammelgefäße zu nutzen oder auf die Großbehälter der elf Landkreis-Wertstoffhöfe zurückzugreifen.

Standorte und Öffnungszeiten sämtlicher Wertstoffhöfe sind im Abfallkalender oder auf der Internetpräsenz www.landkreis-bamberg.de/abfallwirtschaft zu finden.

Sperrmüllabfuhr

Die für 28. bis 30. Januar 2026 terminierten Abfuhren können ebenfalls nicht durchgeführt werden. Sämtliche Anmelder erhalten in Kürze schriftlich einen Ausweichtermin zugeteilt.

Gelbe-Sack-Abfuhr

Wie bei den Altpapiergefäßen sind die Sammelteams bestrebt, auch hier ab 2. Februar 2026 wieder den Sammelbetrieb aufzunehmen. Haushalte, die in der 5. Kalenderwoche 2026 nicht bedient werden konnten, dürfen die Säcke – falls eine Zwischenlagerung bis zur nächsten turnusgemäßen Abfuhr nicht möglich ist – gerne auf den Wertstoffhöfen abgeben.

This raises some interesting questions about how traditional metrics line up with the current share price.
For Levi Strauss, the model uses last twelve months Free Cash Flow of about $283.8 million, then builds a two stage Free Cash Flow to Equity forecast.
Result: UNDERVALUED Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Levi Strauss is undervalued by 13.2%.
Approach 2: Levi Strauss Price vs Earnings For a profitable company like Levi Strauss, the P/E ratio is a useful way to see how much investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.","If you are wondering whether Levi Strauss shares still offer value at around US$21.25, it helps to step back and look at what the current price might already be factoring in.

The stock has returned 1.4% over the last 7 days, 0.7% over the last 30 days, 2.1% year to date and 19.2% over the past year, with a 26.1% return over 3 years and 21.7% over 5 years shaping how investors think about its potential and risks today.

Recent coverage of Levi Strauss has focused on how the brand is positioned in the global apparel sector and how it responds to shifts in consumer demand and retail channels. This context helps explain why the share price has moved in step with changing expectations about the business and its competitive position.

On our checks, Levi Strauss scores for undervaluation. This raises some interesting questions about how traditional metrics line up with the current share price. We will walk through those valuation approaches next, then finish with a broader way to think about what the stock might be worth.

Approach 1: Levi Strauss Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model estimates what a company might be worth today by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting those cash flows back to a present value.

For Levi Strauss, the model uses last twelve months Free Cash Flow of about $283.8 million, then builds a two stage Free Cash Flow to Equity forecast. Analyst inputs cover the next few years, and beyond that Simply Wall St extrapolates the trend to create a ten year path, reaching projected Free Cash Flow of about $796.7 million in 2035. Each of these future cash flows is discounted back, in dollar terms, to reflect the time value of money and risk.

On this basis, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of US$24.47 per share. Compared with the current share price of about US$21.25, the model points to an implied discount of roughly 13.2%, which indicates that the shares are considered undervalued on this cash flow view.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Levi Strauss is undervalued by 13.2%. Track this in your or , or discover .

Approach 2: Levi Strauss Price vs Earnings

For a profitable company like Levi Strauss, the P/E ratio is a useful way to see how much investors are paying for each dollar of earnings. A higher or lower P/E often reflects what the market expects for future growth and how much risk investors see in those earnings.

In simple terms, faster and more reliable earnings growth can justify a higher P/E, while slower growth or higher perceived risk usually calls for a lower, more conservative multiple. The question is what counts as a reasonable, or “fair,” P/E for Levi Strauss today.

Levi Strauss currently trades on a P/E of 15.90x. That sits below the Luxury industry average of about 19.57x and well below the peer group average of 35.50x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio model, which estimates what P/E might make sense given factors like earnings growth, industry, profit margin, market cap and risk, arrives at a Fair Ratio of 17.97x for Levi Strauss. Because this Fair Ratio is tailored to the company’s own profile, it can be more informative than simply comparing against broad industry or peer averages. With the actual P/E below the Fair Ratio, the shares screen as undervalued on this metric.

Result: UNDERVALUED

P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Levi Strauss Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, which simply means writing the story you believe about Levi Strauss and then tying that story to numbers like future revenue, earnings, margins and a fair value estimate.

On Simply Wall St, Narratives live in the Community page and let you spell out why you think the business will perform a certain way, link that view to a financial forecast, and see what fair value that forecast implies compared with the current share price.

The comparison of Fair Value versus Price helps you decide whether the stock looks attractive, fully priced or expensive based on your own assumptions. Your Narrative automatically refreshes when new news, earnings or other data arrive.

For Levi Strauss, one investor might build a Narrative that points to a high fair value based on optimistic revenue and margin assumptions, while another might land on a much lower fair value using more conservative estimates. Both can clearly see how their story connects to the numbers.

Dive Brief:

Data infrastructure issues are derailing enterprise AI investments, leading to $108 billion in wasted annual AI spend, according to a Hitachi Vantara analysis released Tuesday. The tech provider surveyed 1,200 IT decision makers for its report.

More than 4 in 5 businesses with mature data estates reported ROI on their AI investments, compared with less than half of what the firm described as “data laggards.” Only 43% of U.S. leaders believe that their companies have predictive or automated infrastructure operations.

Despite data limitations, surveyed IT leaders expect AI spending to rise by 76% in the next two years as businesses spin up in-house platforms and plan broader deployment efforts.

Dive Insight:

Data and infrastructure have been stubborn components of AI implementations, hindering the training of models for targeted use cases and creating bottlenecks for in-demand services.

Hyperscalers are sprinting to deploy capital, ramping up efforts in the past two years with plans to match available compute capacity with soaring demand for AI services. This year, the spending blitz continues — large cloud providers plan to increase their capital investments by nearly 40% in order to adequately service demand, according to a recent report from S&P Global.

In the enterprise, data sprawl could be hampering broader AI adoption, as data quality is the most commonly cited factor in successful AI implementations, according to Hitachi Vantara.

“The fastest way to waste AI budget is to chase models without fixing the data underneath them,” said Simon Ninan, SVP of business strategy at Hitachi Vantara, in an email to CIO Dive.

The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index fell as much as 0.4% to the lowest since March 2022. The world’s primary reserve currency fell for a fourth straight day, and is coming off its worst week since May.

The weakness reflects investor caution following a bout of unpredictable Washington policymaking, including President Donald Trump’s threats to take over Greenland. Longer-term, risks around Federal Reserve independence, a growing budget deficit, worries about fiscal profligacy and widening political polarization have all pulled the dollar lower.

“Structural drags on the dollar - fading confidence in US trade and security policy, politicization of the Fed, and worsening US fiscal credibility - could outweigh the more neutral cyclical dollar backdrop and pull the dollar lower,” said Elias Haddad, global head of markets strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.

The latest decline also follows signs of US support to boost the beleaguered yen, reopening speculation around the potential for coordinated currency intervention to guide the greenback lower against key trading partners. Reports from traders Friday indicated that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York contacted financial institutions to check on the yen’s exchange rate - a preliminary step that’s often taken before interventions.

Friday’s rate-checking of the dollar-yen rate by Fed officials “drove down the US dollar further,” George Catrambone, head of fixed income at DWS Americas, told Bloomberg Radio on Tuesday.

The yen rallied some 0.7% to 153.03 Tuesday in New York. The yen this month approached 160 per dollar, its weakest level since 2024, and has since rebounded on the speculation.

The drop in the dollar also buoyed the euro, which hit $1.1939 earlier, its strongest level since 2021. The pound rose 0.5% to $1.3748, its highest since July.

Dollar traders are now paying the most on record to hedge against a deeper selloff in the US currency. The premium for short-dated options that profit from a weaker US currency has widened to the highest level since Bloomberg began compiling the data in 2011.

Heavy volumes, meanwhile, underscore the extent to which the dollar outlook has soured. On Monday, trading volumes through the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation hit the second highest on record, surpassed only by the selloff on April 3, 2025.

“We see the risk premium on the dollar building up again,” a Barclays team including Mitul Kotecha and Lhamsuren Sharavdemberel wrote Tuesday, citing the currency’s underperformance following Trump’s Greenland threats.

The recent data from the US point to a solid economic performance, pushing traders to expect the Fed to keep rates unchanged Wednesday. For the rest of the year, the markets price in nearly two quarter-point cuts, which is a contrast with many other major central banks where forecasts are for no change or even chances of a rate hike.

Still, Trump’s pending choice for the next Fed chair has also buffeted the greenback, since speculation is that the next head will be more biased to lower borrowing costs. So too has the risk of a government shutdown as Democrats vow to block a spending package in Congress unless Republicans strip funding for the Department of Homeland Security.

“With a partial government shutdown now possible, there is still plenty to worry dollar bulls,” said Kit Juckes, head of foreign-exchange strategy at Societe Generale. “US growth is still likely to determine how much the Fed eases, and therefore, whether the dollar can weaken significantly from here.”

Berkshire Hathaway Kraft Heinz Exit Signals Post Buffett Portfolio Refit

January 28, 2026

Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) is preparing to sell its entire multibillion-dollar stake in Kraft Heinz.

The planned exit follows the recent appointment of Greg Abel as CEO and marks a major portfolio change after Warren Buffett's tenure.

The move would remove one of Berkshire's largest consumer-focused equity holdings from its public stock portfolio.

Berkshire Hathaway, through its mix of insurance, energy, rail, and a wide range of operating businesses, has long used large equity holdings to complement its core operations. Kraft Heinz has been a key consumer brands exposure within that mix, even as packaged food companies have faced shifting consumer preferences and scrutiny of their product portfolios. For you as an investor, a full exit from Kraft Heinz highlights how Berkshire is reassessing its role in the consumer staples space.

The timing of this planned sale, so close to Greg Abel taking over as CEO, puts extra attention on how Berkshire may handle legacy positions in the post-Buffett era. As more details emerge on execution, you will be able to see whether this is a one-off portfolio cleanup or the first sign of a broader rethink of how Berkshire balances long-term holdings with flexibility in its public equity book.

Stay updated on the most important news stories for by adding it to your or . Alternatively, explore our to discover new perspectives on Berkshire Hathaway.

The potential exit from Kraft Heinz would free up a sizeable amount of capital for Berkshire Hathaway and reduce its exposure to a packaged foods business that has already led to a US$3.76b writedown. For you, the key takeaway is that Greg Abel appears willing to act on long debated concerns about brand strength, consumer shifts toward private labels, and Kraft Heinz' planned split into two companies, rather than keeping a large but troubled position in place.

Berkshire Hathaway narrative: what this move says about the story

This move comes as Berkshire holds a very concentrated equity book, with six stocks making up about 65% of the portfolio and large positions in American Express, Bank of America, Chevron, and Coca Cola described as core holdings. A full or partial exit from Kraft Heinz could be read as Abel trimming legacy positions that no longer fit the long term story, while keeping capital available for areas where Berkshire has historically focused on strong business fundamentals and robust returns on equity.

Risks and rewards to keep in mind

⚠️ Execution risk if Berkshire struggles to redeploy several billions of Kraft Heinz proceeds into opportunities that fit its return and quality hurdles.

⚠️ Earnings are forecast to decline by an average of 0.2% per year for the next 3 years, so shrinking or reshaping the equity portfolio could interact with that outlook.

🎁 Trading at 39.8% below one estimate of fair value may give Berkshire room to realize value if selling is timed and structured carefully.

🎁 A sale could lift Berkshire's already large cash reserves, giving Abel more flexibility for future deals or buybacks.

What to watch next

Watch how quickly Berkshire sells, whether proceeds are held in cash or recycled into new holdings, and if other positions like Sirius XM follow Kraft Heinz onto the chopping block. For a broader sense of how different investors interpret these moves, you can read community views in and see how they connect this decision to the longer term Berkshire story.

New data from Obi, which tracks real-time ride prices and wait times, shows that Waymo has lowered its prices in the San Francisco Bay Area while Uber and Lyft fares have moved higher. Based on nearly 94,000 simulated ride requests collected between late November and early January, Waymo rides averaged $19.69, compared with $17.47 for Uber and $15.47 for Lyft. That’s a big change from April 2025, when Waymo rides were meaningfully more expensive.

According to Obi, the reason for this change is simple: the “novelty premium” for riding in a robotaxi is fading. Indeed, Obi CEO Ashwini Anburajan told TechCrunch that earlier data suggested that riders were willing to pay extra just to try Waymo, but that effect is wearing off in the Bay Area. As a result, Waymo may need to keep pricing more aggressively to stay competitive. Still, wait times remain an important difference. Waymo’s average wait was about 5.7 minutes, compared with three and five minutes for Uber and Lyft, respectively.

The biggest wildcard in the data, however, is Tesla (TSLA). Obi found Tesla’s ride-hailing prices appeared far lower than the others. However, Tesla is not operating a fully driverless robotaxi service in California and instead relies on employee drivers using Full Self-Driving software. Its Bay Area fleet is also small, with roughly 150 active vehicles, resulting in average wait times of over 15 minutes. Even so, consumer interest is strong. In a survey of 2,000 people, Tesla was the preferred autonomous brand for 31% of respondents, trailing Waymo’s 39.8%, with men showing a particularly strong preference for Tesla.

Which Robotaxi Stock Is the Better Buy?

Turning to Wall Street, out of the robotaxi stocks mentioned above, analysts think that UBER stock has the most room to run. In fact, UBER’s average price target of $113.76 per share implies more than 39.8% upside potential.

Does Ipsos (ENXTPA:IPS) Leadership Shift and Steady Outlook Redefine Its Governance Premium?

January 28, 2026

In January 2026, Ipsos SA confirmed its 2025 earnings guidance, expecting total revenue of about €2,525 million with organic growth of 0.6%, while also announcing that long-time Chairman Didier Truchot will step down for health reasons and remain on the Board as main shareholder.

The Board’s decision to appoint experienced insider Laurence Stoclet as Chair, supported by a new Lead Independent Director, highlights a governance structure that couples continuity in ownership with refreshed oversight and leadership.

We will now examine how the confirmed 2025 guidance and leadership transition to Laurence Stoclet shape Ipsos’ investment narrative.

What Is Ipsos' Investment Narrative?

To own Ipsos, you need to believe that a global research provider trading on modest multiples can steadily convert its large client base into resilient, if unspectacular, cash flows. The confirmed 2025 guidance of around €2,525 million in revenue with 0.6% organic growth suggests that, near term, the story is more about earnings quality, capital discipline and capital returns than rapid expansion. Recent share price strength after the update hints that the market did not see the guidance or dividend profile as a negative surprise, so the earnings outlook and valuation case remain broadly intact. Where the latest news really matters is governance: the transition from founder‑chairman Didier Truchot to long‑time insider Laurence Stoclet, supported by a Lead Independent Director, slightly reframes the risk/catalyst mix around board effectiveness and leadership cohesion rather than financial guidance itself.

However, the leadership reshuffle introduces governance questions that investors should not ignore. Ipsos' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Seven Simply Wall St Community fair value views span about €32 to almost €120 per share, underscoring how differently people see Ipsos. Set that against today’s gentle growth guidance and boardroom reshuffle, and you can weigh whether cautious execution risk justifies such a wide spread of expectations.

“While we await further updates from the company, a deal of this nature wouldn’t completely surprise us,” wrote Sam Eiber, a medtech analyst at BTIG.

Eiber noted that InMode’s stock has been under pressure for several years as revenue slowed and subsequently declined about 25% from its 2023 peak.

“There are few signs of a near-term recovery as the company continues to face a challenging market environment for aesthetic capital equipment,” Eiber wrote, adding that other medical aesthetic companies including Syneron, Lumenis, Cynosure, Lutronic, and Alma Lasers have also been acquired by private equity funds over the last decade.

What it means:

NEW American Jobs

The Kernersville Campus moved Manufacturing / Production from Overseas (Japan) to America

The Kernersville campus will produce the ONLY excavator designed, developed, and manufactured in the U.S.

In keeping with our strong tradition of building America, we are excited to announce plans to open two new U.S.-based facilities: a state-of-the-art distribution center near Hebron, Indiana, and a cutting-edge excavator factory in Kernersville, North Carolina, both set to open in the next year.

“Our investment in these new facilities underscores John Deere's dedication to strengthening the backbone of American industry and supporting local economies,” said John May, chairman and chief executive officer of John Deere. “We believe in building America, and these projects represent our intent to continue driving innovation and job creation in the United States.“

Expanding in Indiana: New Distribution Center

John Deere recently broke ground on a new distribution center near Hebron, Indiana, strategically located to enhance our supply chain capabilities nationwide. This facility will be designed to streamline operations and ensure timely delivery of equipment and parts. The Indiana project is anticipated to generate significant employment opportunities with approximately 150 jobs, contributing to the state’s economic growth.

“This new facility is an investment in customer expectations around world class product support through parts availability for our US based ag, turf, construction, forestry, mining and turf customers,” said Denver Caldwell, vice president, Aftermarket and Customer Support. “Indiana's strong workforce and central location make it an ideal choice for expansion.”

John Deere will continue to maintain its primary North American Parts Distribution Center in Milan, Illinois, which has been in operation since 1973 and employs about 1,200 people.

Kernersville, North Carolina: New Excavator Factory

The new $70M factory in Kernersville, North Carolina, will bolster John Deere's manufacturing capabilities, leveraging advanced technologies to produce industry leading excavators for the construction market. The North Carolina factory will assume production of future generation excavators previously produced in Japan.

This facility will employ over 150 people and will help meet equipment demand and strengthen our commitment to U.S. manufacturing innovation.

“We are excited to bring this new facility to our Kernersville campus and to be part of the region’s thriving manufacturing community,“ said Ryan Campbell, president Worldwide Construction and Forestry and Power Systems. “Our focus will be on delivering excellence, creating jobs, and advancing the legacy of John Deere in American manufacturing.”

Building America: Impact and Commitment

With the opening of these two facilities, John Deere will create hundreds of new U.S. jobs, further supporting local communities and advancing our mission to build a stronger America.

“These investments further demonstrate our commitment to invest $20B in U.S. manufacturing over the next 10 years,” May said. “It is a testament to our confidence in the future of U.S. manufacturing and our unwavering commitment to innovation, quality, and economic growth.”

The move, which occurred less than one month after Abel took the reins from predecessor Warren Buffett, comes in the wake of KHC shares kicking off the year by losing more than 3%, following a 2025 performance that saw the stock slide by more than 21%.

But for income investors whose dividend portfolios have relied on the company’s strong yield for years, does Berkshire’s move—which marks the end of its 10-year position—make Kraft Heinz an automatic sell?

The Root of Kraft Heinz’s Issues

Strictly from an earnings perspective, KHC shares have delivered on paper. The last time the company missed earnings expectations was Q4 of 2018. But earnings—in and of themselves—do not equate to profitability.

While bookended by two quarters of profitability in 2025, last Q2 Kraft Heinz posted an enormous loss of more than $7.8 billion. This loss was tied to a $9.3 billion non-cash impairment charge, in addition to falling sales fueled by sticky inflation.

The company, whose roots date back to 1869 (Heinz) and 1903 (Kraft), has leaned on aggressive cost-cutting measures for years, including the controversial zero-based budgeting strategy. A decade after the Kraft-Heinz merger, the food conglomerate is still struggling to get out from under the debt it incurred in that deal.

To put that challenge into perspective, as of Q3 2025, it was carrying more than $19 billion in long-term debt, which easily surpassed its cash position of $2.1 billion.

At the same time, a weak labor market, shifting consumer confidence, and ongoing U.S. dollar devaluation have forced cash-strapped consumers to turn away from brand names and toward private-label (a.k.a. store brand) alternatives.

Can KHC Reverse Course?

In September 2025, Kraft Heinz announced that it will be splitting into two scaled, focused independent companies. That division into two entities—tentatively named Global Taste Elevation Co. and North American Grocery Co.—will be finalized in the second half of 2026.

The plan is to divide the company into scalable businesses with separate focuses. Global Taste Elevation will focus on sauces and condiments, while North American Grocery will focus on meals and snacks.

But the plan is not without its critics, chief among them Warren Buffett, who expressed disapproval, particularly in light of the company’s split not being subject to a shareholder vote.

Long term, the two companies—both of which will be publicly traded under different tickers—may see relief from the problems that have been plaguing Kraft Heinz since its mega-merger 10 years ago. But in the short term, there is little reason to believe a turnaround is imminent.

While the consumer staples firm does not report its full-year and Q4 2025 earnings until Feb. 11, it wouldn’t be unexpected to see quarterly revenue contraction for the ninth consecutive quarter. That has contributed to a negative net margin of 17.35%, indicating that Kraft Heinz is currently spending more than it earns.

Meanwhile, its dividend payout ratio of nearly -43% demonstrates that the company is not generating enough earnings to cover its dividend payments, which could lead to future cuts. Currently, Kraft Heinz’s dividend yields an attractive 6.59%, or $1.60 per share annually. But given its payout ratio, income investors should be prepared for that yield to be reduced.

What Wall Street Thinks About Kraft Heinz?

Sentiment on Kraft Heinz is tepid at best. Of the 23 analysts currently covering the stock, only one assigns it a Buy rating, with 17 assigning it a Hold, and five assigning it a Sell. Overall, KHC receives a consensus Reduce rating.

The average 12-month price target for shares of Kraft Heinz is $26.16, or just more than 11% potential upside from where the stock is changing hands today. The company scores lower than one-third of the companies evaluated by MarketBeat, and ranks 73rd out of 149 stocks in the consumer staples sector. Compounding matters, Kraft Heinz’s financial health falls into the Red Zone, according to Tradesmith, where it has been for more than 19 months.

Institutional ownership remains strong at more than 78%, but that figure is likely to drop once Berkshire Hathaway completes its sale of KHC shares. Current short interest of 4.37% suggests that Wall Street’s bears are keeping an eye on Kraft Heinz in the anticipation of more potential downside in the year ahead.

Many mid-sized retailers now view localization as one of the most reliable ways to maintain healthy margins while keeping pace with consumer expectations around speed, tracking visibility, and seamless returns.
For mid-sized brands, the choice is clear: paying tariffs cuts into profits, while storing inventory closer to customers protects them.
Mid-sized brands are increasingly turning to logistics technology that combines warehouse management, cross-border brokerage, and parcel tracking into one system.
Mid-sized retailers, which often face tight margins and pressure to deliver quickly, feel the impact most.","According to a recent Accenture survey, nearly half of retail executives say an agile supply chain is their top priority, and for good reason. New tariffs and heightened customs scrutiny are reshaping how retailers plan, store, and move inventory across borders. For mid-sized and fast-growing brands, particularly those sourcing from Asia or selling into the United States and Canada, the rules of global commerce look very different from just a few years ago. What was once a reliable international fulfillment model is now vulnerable to rising duties and frequent inspections.

Retailers are now rethinking the fundamentals; this includes where inventory sits, how it flows, and how fulfillment choices directly affect landed cost. And they’re making these decisions under immense pressure. Accenture reports that 45% of retail executives view a flexible supply chain as the primary driver of operational resilience, while a 2025 PwC survey notes that 91% of operations and supply chain leaders plan to significantly alter their logistics strategies in response to U.S. trade policy.

Tariffs are no longer just an extra cost. They are forcing companies to rethink their entire logistics strategy, from where they store inventory and how they ship it to how they handle compliance and use technology. In this environment, the winners aren’t always the biggest companies. In fact, they are the ones that adapt the fastest.

The mid-market imperative: Balancing speed, savings and compliance

Big companies often have the financial cushion to handle sudden cost changes, but mid-size businesses feel the impact of tariffs much more. Even one change in duty rates or a new inspection can hurt profits quickly. Decisions that used to be routine, like where to store inventory or which shipping routes to use, now have major financial consequences.

This reality is driving a strategic shift. Mid-sized brands are discovering that long-term success depends on fulfillment models that balance speed, savings, and compliance simultaneously. Many are shifting from a single, centralized warehouse to multiple regional locations, creating a network that is stronger and more flexible.

It’s important to note that brands are adapting in three key ways.

First, they are spreading out their inventory to avoid repeated cross-border shipments, which can lead to extra duties and unpredictable costs.

Secondly, they are using in-country fulfillment partners who can meet service expectations without exposing every order to import complexity.

And last, they are leveraging integrated customs brokerage expertise to ensure goods are classified accurately and compliantly, which reduces the risk of delays, audits, or unexpected duty bills.

This shift isn’t only about cost savings; it’s also about controlling risk and protecting service continuity. Many mid-sized retailers now view localization as one of the most reliable ways to maintain healthy margins while keeping pace with consumer expectations around speed, tracking visibility, and seamless returns.

Uncertainty in global trade policy has only heightened this urgency. A recent Savanta survey found that only 26% of small business owners have high confidence in how the U.S. government is handling trade policy, while a third report low confidence. With policy signals shifting and tariff changes possible at any time, the appeal of greater control over inventory placement and compliance workflows becomes clear.

Why localizing fulfillment outperforms absorbing tariffs

Retailers that once relied heavily on centralized fulfillment—whether in Asia, the United States, or Europe—are facing escalating landed costs driven by tariff rate adjustments, stricter documentation, and tighter customs inspections. Inconsistent duties and unpredictable clearance timelines make it difficult to maintain stable pricing or reliable delivery promises.

This environment is driving the shift toward localized inventory strategies. By positioning goods closer to the end customer and reducing the number of border crossings, retailers can create predictable cost structures and minimize the risk of tariff-related shocks.

Consider how many brands are now using Canada-based fulfillment to serve U.S. consumers. By strategically routing shipments across the border only as needed—and at lower volumes—they can avoid repetitive import duties that inflate landed costs. Similarly, retailers expanding in Europe are increasingly shifting product storage into the EU itself, so orders can move freely across borders inside the union without incurring additional duties or customs processing.

Localized fulfillment also eliminates what many brands refer to as the “double-tax problem.” When inventory is warehoused in one country and then shipped into another for final distribution, products may incur duties at both entry points. Storing goods closer to the point of consumption prevents unnecessary reimports and stabilizes total supply chain cost.

Beyond cost mitigation, localized fulfillment delivers a customer experience advantage. When goods ship from in-country or nearshore locations, delivery windows shrink and reliability increases. Customs delays, which often frustrate consumers and damage trust, become less common. Returns also move more efficiently, improving customer satisfaction and lowering reverse logistics costs.

For mid-sized brands, the choice is clear: paying tariffs cuts into profits, while storing inventory closer to customers protects them. What started as a way to handle sudden duty increases is becoming a strategy that makes costs more predictable and keeps the business competitive.

The technology backbone: Visibility, forecasting and compliance integration

Localization gives retailers an advantage, but it only works with good technology. Today’s supply chains need real-time visibility across warehouses, shipping partners, and customs. Without a single, connected system, retailers risk misallocating inventory, and even worse, missing compliance requirements that trigger costly delays.

Mid-sized brands are increasingly turning to logistics technology that combines warehouse management, cross-border brokerage, and parcel tracking into one system. With this level of integration, retailers can track in-country inventory levels, monitor regional demand, oversee goods in transit, and identify opportunities to reroute or reallocate inventory to reduce costs or avoid delays.

This creates a real-time command center for supply chain decision-making. When data flows seamlessly across the network, brands can reforecast quickly—which helps to rebalance inventory proactively and anticipate disruptions before they impact customers.

Visibility also plays a central role in addressing one of the industry’s growing concerns: excess inventory. According to McKinsey, U.S. retailers held $740 billion in unsold goods in 2023, tying up massive amounts of working capital. Localization—supported by strong forecasting and demand-planning technology—helps mitigate this by enabling regional allocation, faster replenishment cycles, and more targeted inventory deployment.

Technology also ensures compliance accuracy and reduces the risk of misclassification. As customs authorities adopt more automated and data-driven enforcement practices, digital preparedness is quickly becoming a competitive differentiator.

A new global strategy built close to home

Tariffs aren’t just a short-term problem. In truth, they are becoming a permanent part of global trade. Mid-sized retailers, which often face tight margins and pressure to deliver quickly, feel the impact most. But within this challenge, there is also a big opportunity.

The brands emerging strongest today aren’t necessarily the ones with the largest footprints. At the end of the day, they are the ones that adapt the fastest. They rethink where inventory is stored, while building flexible fulfillment networks. They manage cross-border shipments carefully, and above all else, invest in digital tools that provide real-time visibility.

Localization is changing how global commerce works. Instead of using big central warehouses, retailers are turning to local and nearby fulfillment centers that lower risk and improve the customer experience. What used to be just an operational choice is now a key strategy for protecting profits, boosting resilience, and meeting the needs of more mindful customers.

Global trade isn’t slowing down. It’s simply reorganizing around more localized, digitally enabled, and flexible networks. For mid-market brands navigating the tariff era, this shift represents a path not just to stability, but to a stronger competitive edge.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/12/iqoncept-stockadobecom.YmWCV26WFH.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2026-01-27 19:02:39.604563

Supporters say the measure would protect consumers, crack down on fraud, and help lower insurance costs.
Personal injury attorneys have also voiced opposition, arguing the measure would limit what accident victims can recover — even when they are not at fault.
According to the campaign, those practices increase insurance premiums, raise health care costs, and contribute to higher taxes statewide.
Both supporters and opponents are preparing for a lengthy and expensive campaign, saying the outcome could have wide-ranging impacts on accident victims, medical providers, and insurance costs across California.","A proposed statewide ballot measure backed by Uber is drawing sharp criticism from medical providers and personal injury attorneys, who warn it could limit access to care for accident victims — especially those who are uninsured or underinsured.

The measure, titled the Protecting Automobile Accident Victims From Attorney Self-Dealing Act of 2026, would cap attorney fees at 25% and limit the amount medical providers can recover for treating patients after a car accident.

The Uber-backed proposal was first introduced in 2025 with an initial campaign investment of roughly $12 million.

Supporters say the measure would protect consumers, crack down on fraud, and help lower insurance costs. Opponents argue it would shift the financial burden of accidents from corporations and insurers onto injured patients.

The Providers for Patient Care Political Action Committee, or PPC PAC — a coalition of doctors, patients, and advocates opposing the measure — says the proposal would significantly limit compensation for medical expenses and make it harder for injured people to receive timely treatment after crashes.

Pamela Lopez, lead political consultant for PPC PAC, said the proposal would impose severe limits on medical payments, making it difficult for providers to offer care.

“These limits are so severe that in all likelihood, medical providers will not be able to care for patients after they’re injured in an automobile accident,” Lopez said.

Lopez pointed to a real-case example involving a young mother hit by a drunk driver who needed a cervical MRI costing about $2,300. Under the proposed measure, she said, that same procedure would be reimbursed at about $350, a fraction of the cost.

“Realistically, if you’re telling providers they can only be paid about 10% of the cost, they’re not going to be able to provide care,” Lopez said.

PPC PAC describes the ballot measure as a broader effort by corporate interests to cap medical recovery and weaken existing protections for accident victims, arguing that injured Californians could lose access to the doctors and care they rely on during recovery if the initiative passes.

Personal injury attorneys have also voiced opposition, arguing the measure would limit what accident victims can recover — even when they are not at fault.

Benjamin Drake, owner of the Drake Law Firm with offices in Fresno and Los Angeles, said medical bills can quickly add up after a crash, with emergency room visits often exceeding $20,000.

“You get a $20,000 hospital bill, and the insurance company pays a few hundred dollars based on Medicare rates,” Drake said. “Who pays the rest? Uber wants the patient to pay.”

Drake also pushed back against claims that attorneys drive up medical costs, saying lawyers often help victims receive immediate care without waiting weeks for insurance approvals.

If approved by voters, the measure would apply broadly to all insurers — not just Uber-related cases.

“They're realizing they're paying so much in Premium... insurance companies. They're paying so much for their driver's negligence. They can't limit the law to only apply to themselves because it would be self-dealing. It would be on the face of it. It would look like, hey, I mean I'm protecting just the multi-billion dollar company.”

Supporters of the measure say it would also ban financial relationships between medical providers and legal firms. They argue the initiative targets abusive practices within the legal system while protecting victims from excessive fees and inflated medical bills.

In a statement, campaign spokesman Nathan Click said the proposal would put consumers first.

“Californians deserve a system that prioritizes victims over ambulance lawyers, and that’s exactly what this measure does. Capping attorney fees, banning kickbacks, ending inflated medical billing, and putting in place whistleblower protections will protect auto-accident victims, and in addition to reducing costs for consumers,” Click said.

The campaign argues that “billboard lawyers” and other personal injury attorneys target auto accident victims with heavy advertising, then take a substantial share of settlements while steering clients to medical providers who inflate bills in exchange for kickbacks. Supporters say those practices harm victims and drive up costs across the system.

According to the campaign, those practices increase insurance premiums, raise health care costs, and contribute to higher taxes statewide.

The Protect California Consumers campaign says the initiative would ensure accident victims keep at least 75% of their award, ban kickbacks and hidden fee arrangements, protect whistleblowers who expose fraud, and limit recoveries to the amounts actually paid rather than inflated billed amounts.

The measure is expected to appear on the November 2026 ballot. Both supporters and opponents are preparing for a lengthy and expensive campaign, saying the outcome could have wide-ranging impacts on accident victims, medical providers, and insurance costs across California.

State analysts say the proposal could save California’s trial courts millions to tens of millions of dollars each year by reducing the number of car accident cases filed. However, those savings could be offset by higher Medi-Cal costs, as some crash victims may receive less compensation and rely more heavily on state-funded medical coverage.",https://kmph.com/resources/media2/16x9/3111/1320/0x163/90/152f6c2b-c7f2-4cb2-b622-f57d2e23fc99-AdobeStock_288083995_Editorial_Use_Only.jpeg,N,,2026-01-27 17:02:11.243597

Dan Diasio, the global consulting AI leader for EY, believes that for companies to successfully transform with AI, they need three things: mindset, skill set, and tool set.
Right now, most businesses are hyper focused on the AI tool set, but haven’t contemplated why the tool set is necessary.","A good metric for measuring the success of your AI rollout is how much people gripe about it. If no one’s pushing back on your AI strategy, that may be a sign you’re not going far enough. So says George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen in season nine of the WorkLab podcast, where we explore what it really takes to become a Frontier Firm: a human-led, agent-operated organization that buys intelligence like it’s electricity, puts it to work like an employee, and compounds it like interest. There’s no cheat code to getting there, but these insights, from Harvard Business School professors and consultants and public intellectuals, will jump-start the process.

1. AI reskilling isn’t a skills problem—it’s an identity shock.

Instructing your employees to remake their professions around AI is also a way of telling them to fundamentally change who they are. That’s why an online course or a PowerPoint playbook won’t sufficiently reskill your workforce. Harvard Business School’s Raffaella Sadun says an overhaul of your workflows starts with articulating the purpose and goals of AI adoption: “Start by specifying why is it that you want your people to be reskilled, what’s the business rationale,” she says. “Create some certainty for the organization that [let’s them think], ‘Okay, this is why we’re doing it. There might be a future for me because the organization is going in that direction.’”

2. Using AI isn’t the point.

Dan Diasio, the global consulting AI leader for EY, believes that for companies to successfully transform with AI, they need three things: mindset, skill set, and tool set. Right now, most businesses are hyper focused on the AI tool set, but haven’t contemplated why the tool set is necessary. “It’s kind of like going to the gym if you’re trying to run the New York Marathon,” Diasio says. Running on the treadmill is how you train, but it’s not the point. “Instead, start to think about what the main objective is and where value is going to be created.”

3. Your relationships are your greatest assets.

Judgment and persuasion will matter more than ever, says Cowen, the economist. AI can supplement or improve on what humans do, but it can’t replicate them outright. “You’ll need to build out your personal network much more. Who can actually vouch for you, recommend you, speak to what you’ve done with them or for them?” As author and AI expert Pascal Bornet points out, genuine creativity, critical thinking, and trust-built relationships are uniquely human characteristics. Ironically, strength in those areas is what makes someone best suited to working with agents: They’re the skills that determine how effectively you can design agents and write prompts.

4. If people complain, that’s good.

“This may sound counterintuitive,” Cowen says, “but the more unhappy people are, the better we’re doing.” Progress is inherently disruptive—it means less predictability, which makes people uncomfortable. The question for leaders isn’t how to eliminate confusion or disorientation. It’s how to recognize when it signals real progress.

Avenir LNG operates five small-scale LNG bunker vessels currently in service, with two more under construction.

Any transaction would leave Stolt-Nielsen with a significant holding. If a deal is agreed, the group plans to jointly own and operate Avenir LNG as a joint venture with the incoming partner.

The potential sale remains subject to final documentation and customary regulatory approvals, which are expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.

The move comes less than a year after Stolt-Nielsen Gas completed the compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares in Avenir LNG in April 2025, making it a wholly owned subsidiary. The latest talks suggest the group is now looking to bring in a partner to help fund growth and underline the value of the LNG segment.

Shipping analysts at Swedish investment bank SEB estimate Avenir LNG’s enterprise value at around $210m, based on a 9.0x EV/EBITDA multiple on 2026 forecasts. SEB said a deal at or above that level would help crystallise the unit’s value and could act as a positive catalyst for Stolt-Nielsen’s shares.

With a market capitalization of $274.48 billion, IBM is a major player in the technology sector, specifically within the software industry.

Financial Health Analysis

IBM's financial health is underscored by several key metrics:

Revenue growth over the past three years has been modest at 1.8%, with total trailing twelve-month sales reaching $65.4 billion.

The company's operating margin stands at 17.65%, indicating efficient cost management, while the net margin is 12.09%.

IBM's EBITDA margin is 24.79%, reflecting strong earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

On the balance sheet, IBM's current ratio is 0.93, and the debt-to-equity ratio is 2.39, suggesting a high level of leverage. The Altman Z-Score of 3.52 indicates strong financial health, while the Piotroski F-Score of 7 suggests a very healthy situation.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

IBM's valuation metrics are as follows:

The P/E ratio is 35.13, which is close to its 1-year low, indicating potential undervaluation.

The P/S ratio is 4.22, nearing its 10-year high, suggesting the stock may be overvalued relative to sales.

Analyst sentiment remains positive, with a recommendation score of 2.4, indicating a ""Buy"" consensus. Institutional ownership stands at 63.75%, reflecting strong interest from large investors.

Risk Assessment

Bridgestone, Michelin, Pirelli and 10 other tyre manufacturers in the United States are facing off in court against the Institute for Fisheries Resources and the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, who are represented by the environmental group Earthjustice.

Plaintiffs argue that usage of the additive 6PPD can devastate coho salmon and other fish populations who live off the coasts of California and Alaska.

The suit charges that the use of the additive constitutes an illegal “taking” under the US Endangered Species Act, affecting 24 populations of coho, Chinook salmon and steelhead trout listed as threatened.

The 13 tyre companies have argued that 6PPD provides an essential safety function by ensuring the integrity of tyres when they come into contact with ozone and oxygen.

But plaintiffs say the use of 6PPD, when combined with ozone, produces 6PPD-quinone or 6PPD-q, which moves into waterways after storm events, with devastating consequences for fish populations.

Scientific studies published by prestigious journals have shown such substances to be damaging to fish populations, even at low doses.

ALSO READ | City urges residents to keep drains clear as heavy rains continue

6PPD-q “can kill coho salmon within hours and the chemical is largely responsible for ‘urban runoff mortality syndrome,’ which can kill up to 100 percent of salmon returning to freshwater streams to spawn in the Pacific Northwest before they can lay eggs,” Earthjustice says on its website.

On Monday, researcher Edward Kolodziej testified before US Judge James Donato that just one automobile could do tremendous damage.

A car contains four tyres with enough of the chemical that, after interacting with ozone, could produce enough to 6PPD-q to kill more than 11 million salmon, said Kolodziej, whose testimony followed video of a salmon flailing in the water in distress.

Countering that testimony were remarks from scientist Tiffany Thomas of consultancy Exponent, who told the court that the findings presented by plaintiffs’ scientists were based on laboratory conditions rather than real life and therefore were “limited and speculative.”

Concentrations of 6PPD-q found in waterways are well below lethal doses, according to Thomas.

Tire companies maintain, further, that there is no substitute for 6PPD, adding that other possible options would have worse environmental impacts.

Hearings in the case will continue on Wednesday and Thursday with further testimony from scientists. A ruling is expected at a later time.

Beyond the California case, the European Chemicals Agency is also weighing potential restrictions on 6PPD in tyres.",https://witness.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/144/2026/01/Chinook-salmon-swimming-upriver.-Photo-from-Pexels.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 00:59:53.542544

Walmart Connect Mexico is partnering with Advertima for a large in-store audience intelligence rollout for in-store retail media.

Walmart Connect Mexico selected Advertima based on its exclusive focus on in-store retail media and its ability to deliver audience intelligence at hypermarket scale.

Each sensor captures the shop floor in 3D over distances exceeding 30 meters and supports multi-3D zoning, allowing a single sensor to inform multiple digital and non-digital media touchpoints in parallel.

The deployment will span hundreds of Walmart Supercenters with thousands of Audience AI sensors, according to a press release.

The deployment represents an evolution of Walmart Connect Mexico's In-Store Retail Media offering. Real-time audience intelligence will be introduced across both digital and non-digital in-store media touchpoints.

Walmart Connect Mexico will start with three initial use cases:

Audience measurement across non-digital in-store promotional spaces, primarily supporting trade and shopper marketing campaigns.

Audience measurement across digital in-store media, including digital signage.

Real-time audience targeting on digital in-store media via direct I/O bookings.

Secures 50 percent of SWM’s national electricity demand, supporting 2033 decarbonization goals

Demonstrates growing industrial demand for stable renewable procurement in energy-intensive sectors

TotalEnergies will supply 800 GWh of clean firm power to paper manufacturer SWM over ten years beginning in 2026, marking one of France’s stronger examples of heavy industry locking in stable renewable procurement to control costs and reduce emissions.

Contract Structure and Supply Profile

The agreement covers three SWM plants in France, located at Papeteries de Saint Girons, PDM Industries, and LTR Industries. TotalEnergies will deliver a constant renewable supply profile, drawing from roughly 50 MW of its operating renewable assets in the country.

Clean firm power remains a critical instrument for European industrial buyers that cannot compromise output due to intermittency. By blending renewables with flexible assets inside an integrated production portfolio, TotalEnergies aims to reduce balancing risk for customers as the continent tightens climate rules and electricity markets absorb higher volumes of variable generation.

“We are delighted to support SWM in its decarbonization efforts and pursuit of competitiveness through our ‘clean firm power’ solutions. This contract illustrates TotalEnergies’ ability to offer tailor-made solutions adapted to the specific needs of our industrial customers in France. These solutions are based on our integrated production portfolio combining both renewable and flexible assets,” said Sophie Chevalier, Senior Vice President Flexible Power & Integration at TotalEnergies.

Cost Stability for an Energy-Intensive Sector

For SWM, the agreement secures half of its electricity consumption in France. The company framed the contract as both an emissions lever and a financial hedge, with energy costs weighing heavily on industrial competitiveness across Europe as carbon policies tighten and power markets remain volatile.

“This agreement secures half of our French electricity needs from renewable sources for the next decade, a decisive step toward our commitment to significantly reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2033. For an energy-intensive industry like ours, this isn’t just an environmental milestone; it’s a strategic investment that gives us cost predictability and strengthens our ability to offer customers genuinely sustainable solutions,” stated Giuliano Scilio, Vice President & CIO at SWM.

Governance and Policy Context

France and the EU are intensifying efforts to decarbonize manufacturing supply chains under the Fit for 55 package, tightening state aid frameworks, and preparing for broader carbon border adjustment enforcement. Heavy industries are among the bloc’s priority targets for electrification and efficiency, raising demand for corporate power purchase agreements and long-duration renewable contracts.

Industrial PPAs are increasingly viewed as a core instrument for compliance with climate reporting obligations, both under EU sustainability disclosure requirements and emerging Scope 3 transparency expectations from multinational buyers.

Investor and C-Suite Takeaways

For investors, the contract reinforces an important structural trend: renewable procurement is shifting from discretionary sustainability branding toward balance sheet and risk management strategy. Energy-intensive manufacturers are among the fastest-growing buyers of firmed clean power in Europe as electrification deepens and carbon pricing erodes the viability of fossil-based power.

For corporates, firm renewable arrangements can support predictable input costs, hedge compliance exposure, and strengthen low-carbon product claims within downstream markets that are beginning to price emissions into procurement decisions.

Regional and Global Significance

Although national in scope, the SWM arrangement reflects broader industrial clean power demand across Europe, North America, and parts of Asia, where long-term procurement is becoming foundational to competitiveness.

On Jan. 26, a case brought by commercial fishing groups went before a judge, accusing major tire manufacturers of using a chemical additive that can be lethal to endangered fish once it washes into rivers and streams. The lawsuit targets companies including Bridgestone, Michelin, and Pirelli, along with several other U.S. tire makers.

At the center of the dispute is 6PPD, a compound used to prevent tires from breaking down when exposed to air and ozone. According to the plaintiffs, that same chemical transforms into a toxic byproduct known as 6PPD-quinone once tire particles are washed off roads during storms. They argue this runoff can devastate salmon populations along the California and Alaska coasts.

The suit, backed by the Institute for Fisheries Resources and the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations and represented by Earthjustice, claims the chemical’s use violates the Endangered Species Act by harming threatened populations of coho and Chinook salmon, as well as steelhead trout.

During testimony, University of Washington researcher Edward Kolodziej said 6PPD-quinone can kill coho salmon within hours and is a major driver of so-called “urban runoff mortality,” where salmon die before they can spawn.

Tire companies countered that the science relies heavily on lab studies and that real-world concentrations are far lower. They also argue there is currently no safer alternative to 6PPD.

IBD affects an estimated 3 million people globally and is a lifelong progressive condition that often leads to frequent hospitalizations and surgeries, significantly impacting patients' quality of life.1 Current standard of care options are unable to prevent to reverse common complications of IBD, leaving an unmet need in treatment.

""In IBD, too many patients continue to progress and experience severe complications despite currently available anti-inflammatory therapies. We are excited to join forces with Simcere to accelerate the development of this therapeutic as a potential life changing option for patients living with IBD,” said Carine Boustany, U.S. innovation unit site head and global head of immunology and respiratory diseases at Boehringer Ingelheim.

The collaboration marks Simcere's second out- licensing transaction in the autoimmune field, as of January 2026, Simcere has completed a total of five out-licensing deals for its self-developed novel drug technologies, with a total potential transaction value of approximately $4.6 billion.1

Over the past several months Boehringer has continued to enter both license and collaboration agreements in an effort to advance and strengthen its autoimmune and inflammatory disease pipelines, including its recent global licensing agreement with CDR-Life, developing CDR-Life’s antibody based molecule CDR111 designed to selectively target and deplete B cells with the goal of achieving immune system reset for autoimmune diseases.

What is SIM0709?

Simcere developed its long-acting humanized bispecific antibody SIM0709 using its proprietary multi-specific antibody platform.1 The antibody was designed to simultaneously target tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 15 (TL1A) and interleukin-23 (IL-23), thereby blocking two core pathways driving the onset and progression of IBD.1

SIM0709 has also demonstrated superior synergistic efficacy in both vitro primary cell studies and vivo animal studies, outperforming the combination of the two corresponding monotherapies.1

""Simcere's bispecific antibody SIM0709 was engineered with our proprietary multi-specific antibody platform with first-in-class potential for IBD treatment.

By Margaret Attridge, Courthouse News Service

A chemical additive in car tires is leaching into rivers and other waterways, killing protected fish species, lawyers for a conservation group and a fishing trade association told a federal judge during a bench trial in San Francisco, California, Monday.

After a three-day trial, the judge will determine whether tire manufacturers — including Bridgestone America, Goodyear Tires and Michelin North America — are violating the Endangered Species Act by harming protected and endangered fish species like coho salmon, steelhead trout and Chinook salmon.

The plaintiffs claim the tire manufacturers make or distribute products that contain an additive called 6PPD, a chemical that ultimately transforms into 6PPD-quinone when it reacts with ozone. As the tire interacts with the environment and roads, 6PPD-quinone leaches onto hard surfaces. When it rains, the chemical falls into rivers and other waterways, where it can kill fish in a matter of hours, they add.

After exposure, fish start displaying symptoms of urban runoff mortality syndrome, causing them to lose equilibrium and die within a few hours. Even if they’re transferred to non-polluted water before they die, they don’t recover from the syndrome, the plaintiffs say.

U.S. District Judge James Donato, a Barack Obama appointee, opened the first day of trial by cutting off the plaintiffs’ opening statements, opting to go right into witness testimony.

The plaintiffs’ primary witness, Edward Kolodziej, a scientist who studies urban runoff mortality syndrome, told the judge that tires are the main source of 6PPD-quinone in waterways and roadway runoff is likely to have high 6PPD-quinone concentrations.

He added that continued use of tires containing the chemical along the coast will cause harm or kill endangered coho salmon and other protected fish species, estimating that one car with four tires could theoretically create enough 6PPD-quinone to threaten the lives of an estimated 11 million coho salmon.

“6PPD-Q helps make tires more durable and crack less. When it reacts with ozone, 6PPD-Q forms on the surface of the tire; therefore, if the rubber surface gets wet, the 6PPD-Q leaches into water and moves with roadway runoff,” he said.

During Kolodziej’s testimony, the plaintiffs laid out how 6PPD-quinone was discovered and the effect it has on vulnerable aquatic populations.

Kolodziej said his team was contacted in 2018 after witnesses documented female coho salmon dying in urban streams before reproducing. His team identified a mortality signature for the chemicals that were present in the water when the fish perished, identifying the majority of the chemicals as derivatives from tire rubber. A 2021 study published by his team concluded that 6PPD-quinone was the primary toxic chemical in Urban Runoff Mortality Syndrome.

“It opened up our eyes that there are a lot of abundant tire rubber chemicals we knew little about,” he said. “Learning more and more about tires could explain this case of mortality.”

Kolodziej added that he was in communication with representatives from the tire industry throughout his studies, and in 2018, industry representatives met with scientists to discuss their latest findings.

“We did not want the industry to be surprised; they were obviously paying attention to our work,” he said.

In contrast, the defense’s main witness, Tiffany Thomas, a principal scientist at science consulting firm Exponent, testified that 6PPD-quinone is quick to degrade and has the opportunity to react with different chemicals and undergo many physical actions between the road surface and surface water.

She also testified that the concentration of 6PPD-quinone can vary widely depending on several factors, including storm conditions, the amount of organic carbon in the area and the path the water is subjected to, adding that any metrics of 6PPD-quinone concentration have to be “site-specific.”

“Without understanding all these factors, the ability to predict is speculation,” she said, adding that Kolodziej acknowledged the factors, but did not weigh them in his opinions.

“It’s not universally translatable to every location at every time,” she said.

Thomas further testified that the knowledge available on 6PPD-quinone was not enough to draw adefinitive line between the chemical and harmed fish populations.

“The data available on 6PPD-Q is inadequate to reliably predict the presence, phase, and concentration of 6PPD-Q in the streams and rivers in the salmonid populations identified in the complaint,” she said.

In a statement to Courthouse News, Sam Singer, a spokesman for the tire companies, said that “safety is the tire industry’s top priority.”

“For decades, 6PPD has been an essential ingredient in tires to prevent degradation and cracking that can jeopardize driver and passenger safety. There is currently no suitable alternative for 6PPD in tire manufacturing,” he said.

“The defendants remain committed to working with regulators and are actively participating in regulatory processes to identify a viable alternative to 6PPD. Any alternative must meet established standards for safety,” he continued.

Glen Spain, general legal counsel and northwest regional director of the Institute for Fisheries Resources and the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen’s Associations, told Courthouse News that families on the West Coast depend on salmon for their livelihoods.

“The use of 6PPD in tires has been shown to harm vulnerable salmon populations. Whether or not this should continue will be up to the court,” he said.",https://mavensnotebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tires-in-the-rain-DepositPhotos.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:12:11.299601

Study Overview

Boston Scientific is launching a clinical study titled “Gathering of Results in Eligible Asian Obese Populations About Safety and Effectiveness of OverStitch ESG Trial.” The goal is to test how safe and effective the OverStitch NXT Endoscopic Suture System is for weight loss procedures in obese patients, with a focus on Asian populations. The study matters because it could support regulatory approval for a less invasive weight loss option and open a new growth channel for Boston Scientific in the global obesity market.

Intervention/Treatment

The main treatment is the OverStitch NXT Endoscopic Suture System, a medical device used during endoscopy to place sutures inside the stomach. Doctors use it to perform endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), which reduces stomach size without traditional surgery. The aim is to help patients lose weight while lowering the risks and recovery time compared with surgical procedures.

Study Design

This is an interventional, randomized study. Patients are assigned to groups by chance. One group receives ESG with the OverStitch NXT device plus lifestyle support, another group serves as control with lifestyle support alone, and a roll‑in group helps sites gain experience with the procedure. The trial uses a parallel design, meaning groups are treated and followed at the same time. Masking is single, so patients do not know their assignment, while doctors do. The main purpose is treatment: to see if ESG with OverStitch NXT improves weight loss and safety versus lifestyle changes alone.

Study Timeline

The study is listed as “Not Yet Recruiting,” so enrollment has not started. The initial submission to the registry was on November 30, 2025, marking the formal planning and disclosure of the trial. The most recent update was filed on January 26, 2026, showing that Boston Scientific is actively maintaining the protocol and moving toward site activation and patient recruitment. Primary and final completion dates are not yet posted, which is typical before recruitment begins and means investors should expect data readouts several years after enrollment starts.

Market Implications

This update signals that Boston Scientific is investing for growth in obesity care, a large and expanding market that sits between drug therapies and bariatric surgery. If the study proves positive and leads to approval for ESG in Asian markets, it could support higher procedure volumes and recurring device revenue for BSX, improving the company’s mix of growth assets. Investors may see this as a long‑term catalyst rather than a near‑term earnings driver, since revenue impact will follow regulatory and reimbursement milestones. The move also positions Boston Scientific against competitors in endoscopic and robotic weight loss interventions, and adds another tool in a market now influenced by powerful obesity drugs. Success would likely boost sentiment around BSX’s innovation pipeline and diversification beyond traditional cardiology devices.

The study is ongoing at the planning stage and updated on the ClinicalTrials portal, where further details are available.

Elavon, a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Bank and one of the world's largest payment processors, is collaborating with Microsoft to introduce Elavon Live Payments, a groundbreaking payments app for Microsoft 365 offered through the Microsoft Marketplace.

Driven by the omni-channel capabilities of the Elavon Payments Gateway (EPG), Elavon Live Payments enables businesses and professional service providers to securely send invoices and collect customer payments with just a few clicks on a computer or mobile device. That means reducing the friction associated with old-school business payment processes and fewer days waiting for money owed. It is the first major embedded payments expansion on the EPG platform.

""Business professionals waste countless hours switching between multiple platforms to create invoices, send them to clients, and track payments,"" said Pari Sawant, global chief product officer at Elavon. ""Elavon Live Payments solves this challenge by eliminating traditional payment collection barriers allowing business owners to integrate payment workflows directly into commonly used Microsoft 365 applications like Outlook or Teams in real time, which can reduce Days Sales Outstanding and foster business growth.""

DUBAI, UAE, Jan. 27, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Dubai Media City, the Middle East's leading hub dedicated to the media and content creation sector, is marking its 25th anniversary of pioneering innovation and growth in the creative industries.

One of TECOM Group PJSC's 10 vibrant business districts, Dubai Media City has played an instrumental role in transforming Dubai into a global media hub and an international destination for talent, investment, and innovation.

Dubai Media City was launched to establish Dubai's reputation as a multi-dimensional Arab media capital offering a comprehensive, nurturing ecosystem and state-of-the-art infrastructure to spur industry growth. Curated to cement Dubai's position on the global media landscape, the district has a rich legacy of contributing towards economic transformation, and has played a key role in strengthening the knowledge economy by attracting strategic investments and reinforcing Dubai's position as a global hub for media innovation.

Dubai Media City was the stepping stone to the creation of TECOM Group's Media Cluster, which also includes Dubai Production City and Dubai Studio City. A complete ecosystem for more than 40,000 creative professionals, the Media Cluster is the address of more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies in the media sector. Home to a wide range of TV and radio companies as well as social media and digital content creators, the Media Cluster is the broadcasting base for news and entertainment content in some of the world's most spoken languages, including Arabic, English, German, Hindi, Chinese, and Tagalog.

""The visionary leadership of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has solidified Dubai Media City's position as a globally leading hub for the media sector,"" said Majed Al Suwaidi, Senior Vice President of Dubai Media City, Dubai Production City, and Dubai Studio City, part of TECOM Group. ""Dubai Media City has played a leading role in attracting and nurturing globally accomplished media leaders for more than 25 years, contributing to the nation's knowledge- and innovation-based economy.

""As the region's largest community for the media sector, Dubai Media City will continue to provide an advanced ecosystem for the industry that is supported by robust mechanisms, innovative solutions, and future-focused technologies, reinforcing Dubai's position as a global centre for the creative economy.""

Empowering content creation

Offering sector-specific infrastructure and a nurturing environment to enable sustainable business growth, Dubai Media City has attracted some of the world's largest media and advertising companies, such as CNN, Discovery Networks, WPP, and Publicis Groupe. The district is also home to globally renowned regional champions such as ITP Media Group, which has a portfolio of more than 75 brands reaching over 100 million people, as well as OSN Group, whose subsidiary OSN Streaming attracted a strategic investment from Warner Bros. Discovery last year.

The district has been instrumental in nurturing the progress of global industry leaders, homegrown content creators, and leading Arab media voices alike. Alongside Dubai Production City and Dubai Studio City, Dubai Media City is credited with contributing directly to Dubai's recognition as the Capital of Arab Media 2020 and 2021 by the Arab Information Ministers Council.

In 2024, Dubai retained its position as the top global destination for attracting Greenfield Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in cultural and creative industries for the third consecutive year, as reported by the Financial Times' 'fDi Markets' and its 'Creative Industries Cluster' classification. The city attracted 971 cultural and creative sector projects during the year, with total FDI capital inflows reaching AED 18.86 billion and resulting in the creation of 23,517 new jobs.

Empowering talent

Dubai Media City's contributions towards the creative economy are reinforced by its support for talent development initiatives such as the Emirati Media Talent Pledge signed by TECOM Group at the Arab Media Forum in 2024. The district also strengthens efforts to drive the creative economy's growth as the home of the UAE Ministry of Economy & Tourism's InstaBlock Lab, established through a memorandum of understanding with Spanish professional football league LaLiga. Inaugurated in 2025, the lab is designed to accelerate the blocking of websites that violate intellectual property (IP) rights.

Moreover, Dubai Media City connects professionals through community events such as Creative Brunch, as well as its role as Strategic Partner of Dubai Lynx, MENA's leading platform for creative excellence and effectiveness. Dubai Media City is also contributing towards the industry's knowledge-building pathways by championing strategic initiatives such as Dubai Press Club's Arab Media Outlook – Future Vision flagship report, for which the district is Knowledge Partner.

Empowering innovation

As part of TECOM Group's Media Cluster, Dubai Media City also contributes towards innovators by supporting start-ups through in5 Media – one of four sector-specific verticals under Dubai's leading incubator, in5. Since its inception in 2013, in5 has nurtured more than 1,100 start-ups that have raised over AED 9 billion in funding.

in5 Media offers access to creative spaces, training and mentorship, and networking opportunities, as well as sector-specific facilities such as recording and podcasting spaces and green rooms through its dedicated centre at Dubai Production City. The incubator offers pathways for collaboration within TECOM Group's ecosystem, including Dubai Studio City, which features infrastructure such as backlots, sets, production offices, and the region's largest sound stages.

Additionally, D/Quarters, TECOM Group's co-working platform offering world-class facilities adaptive to future-focused businesses, is also based at the heart of Dubai Media City and Dubai Internet City. D/Quarters provides a high-tech ecosystem that nurtures the growth of ambitious freelancers and large corporations alike.

Dubai Media City is part of TECOM Group's portfolio of 10 sector-specific business districts, which includes Dubai Internet City, Dubai Production City, Dubai Studio City, Dubai International Academic City, Dubai Knowledge Park, Dubai Science Park, Dubai Industrial City, and Dubai Design District (d3).

The plans call for a nearly 180,000 square foot retail or grocery store and an accompanying gas station and convenience store.
Some who have looked at the plans think that it looks similar to a Walmart or Sam’s Club.
That would add a lot of traffic to an already busy intersection.
We reached out to the City of Waukee for any news on potential development, and they referred us back to the concept plan and rezoning documents.","WAUKEE, Iowa — A rezoning plan in Waukee indicates a grocery store and associated gas station could be coming to an already busy part of the western suburb.

The plan indicates a request to rezone the plot of land on the northeast corner of Alice’s Road and Hickman Road for commercial development. The plans call for a nearly 180,000 square foot retail or grocery store and an accompanying gas station and convenience store.

Some who have looked at the plans think that it looks similar to a Walmart or Sam’s Club.

That would add a lot of traffic to an already busy intersection. A Hy-Vee already sits on the northwest corner of the intersection, and a Target was recently built in the area as part of the Waukee Town Center development.

Residents in the area have expressed a mixture of excitement for new shopping options and hesitation regarding the amount of traffic a new store would cause.

Courtney Clark, a Waukee resident expressed: “I was super excited, not necessarily for that spot. Just with it being so busy, I mean we’ve lived here for just over four years and it has grown immensely in that four years that we’ve been here. That intersection particularly … it’s always busy.”

She says a Walmart or Sam’s Club could make the intersection similar to other parts of the metro notorious for bad traffic.

“When I saw that that would possibly be going there I just instantly thought of Ankeny, like the Oralabor intersection that is just, it’s a mess. I mean I don’t go to Ankeny very often anymore but I avoid that exit, that intersection at all costs. And even being a Waukee resident, it drives me nuts to drive on Hickman half the time.”

Some residents expressed a desire for a new store farther south, such as along Grand Prairie Parkway near the interstate, or more to the west, closer to the Waukee Triangle.

We reached out to the City of Waukee for any news on potential development, and they referred us back to the concept plan and rezoning documents. We also spoke with Hurd Realty who currently own the plot of land in Waukee, and they declined our request for an interview.",https://who13.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2026/01/waukee-walmart.png?w=1280,N,,2026-01-27 13:13:38.057318

Organisers said they had introduced exemptions for certain humanitarian and security-related cargo categories, while passenger traffic was excluded from the action.
The scale of involvement has been described with high estimates, reaching into the thousands of trucks, although an exact figure has yet to be recorded.
The Western Balkans are fully integrated into EU manufacturing supply chains, including the automotive sector, where delays quickly translate into production costs and missed deliveries.
The protest continued on 27 January 2026, with the prospect of extending it throughout the week in the absence of negotiating openings.","On the afternoon of 26 January 2026, hauliers from Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and North Macedonia launched a coordinated blockade at more than twenty freight border crossings into the Schengen area, with simultaneous blocks starting at 12.00 and actions already under way from midnight on some inbound routes to the Balkan countries. The protest was organised by the main national road haulage associations and disrupted traffic continuity along the axis linking the European Union with Turkey and the Middle East, with immediate repercussions for transit times, vehicle availability and delivery reliability along regional corridors.

The protest stems from the strict application of the Schengen 90-days-in-180 rule to non-EU professional drivers and from the entry into operation of the digital Entry/Exit System (EES), which makes the verification of days of stay more stringent. The associations argue that a rule designed for short stays becomes, with automated enforcement, an operational constraint that drastically reduces workable days in the Schengen area and increases the risk of stops, refusals of entry and penalties. According to the Bosnia and Herzegovina hauliers’ association, in 2025 more than one hundred drivers were reportedly expelled for exceeding the limit, with further measures announced in the days preceding the blockade.

The blocks on 26 January affected the main freight terminals and road crossings along the Serbia–Hungary, Serbia–Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina–Croatia, North Macedonia–Greece and Montenegro–Croatia routes, with the addition of the port of Bar, where hauliers restricted access and operations at the terminal and in the free zone area. Organisers said they had introduced exemptions for certain humanitarian and security-related cargo categories, while passenger traffic was excluded from the action. The organisation was based on shifts, continuous blockss and logistical support for drivers waiting, with the aim of maintaining pressure for at least a week.

The scale of involvement has been described with high estimates, reaching into the thousands of trucks, although an exact figure has yet to be recorded. The visible effect at border crossings was an almost total reduction in crossing capacity for industrial vehicles, with queues, journey rescheduling and diversions onto alternative routes where available. In Hungary, diversions and exit restrictions towards the Serbian border were suggested, with real-time updates from the authorities.

The economic impact also appears significant. The president of the Serbian Chamber of Commerce, Marko Čadež, quoted by Agenzia Nova, estimated direct losses from blocked exports at €100 million per day and contractual penalties for delays of between €10,000 and €50,000 per day per company, with around 10,000 exporting firms involved on the Serbia–EU channel alone. In parallel, the Kosovo Chamber of Commerce warned of a potential impact on the regional value chain of almost €1 billion per day, a figure that includes delays, additional costs and supply disruptions.

The most exposed supply chains are those involving components and time-critical deliveries, as well as fresh produce. The Western Balkans are fully integrated into EU manufacturing supply chains, including the automotive sector, where delays quickly translate into production costs and missed deliveries. In this context, the border blockades affect not only Balkan exports but also return flows of semi-finished goods and components, as well as e-commerce logistics along south-east European and eastern Mediterranean routes. The network effect has also affected countries not taking part in the protest. Kosovo depends on transit via Serbia and North Macedonia, with impacts on imports and exports, and has issued an appeal for EU institutional intervention to restore circulation until a permanent solution is found.

One feature of the mobilisation on 26 January is institutional support, in some cases explicit. In North Macedonia, local sources reported the presence at the Blace crossing of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Transport Aleksandar Nikoloski, who described the protest as “a warning” ahead of the full operational launch of the EES scheduled for 10 April 2026 and indicated February and March as a useful window for a shared solution. In Serbia, Agenzia Nova reported Čadež’s visit to the Batrovci crossing, aimed at strengthening damage assessments and turning the issue into an economic priority, while in Bosnia and Herzegovina, European Western Balkans reported statements by the Minister of Communications and Transport, Edin Forto, expressing understanding of the hauliers’ reasons and the need for dialogue at EU level.

European Commission spokesperson Markus Lammert said that the EES does not change short-stay rules but allows for better enforcement, while acknowledging that there may be a need for flexibility for highly mobile professions such as hauliers and athletes. The response, however, contains no immediate operational proposal, and this point has been cited by organisers as a reason to maintain the blockade. The Secretariat of the Transport Community has reconstructed previous exchanges and the organisation’s limited room for manoeuvre, reiterating that the matter falls under the competence of the European Commission and the Member States.

The technical issue remains how stays are calculated and enforced. Hauliers’ associations particularly contest the fact that both the day of entry and the day of exit are counted as full days, further reducing effective availability for repeated missions. Hence the demand for a special status for professional drivers, or for an alternative counting mechanism that distinguishes cross-border work from personal stays. Among the options discussed is the creation of a separate category within the EES and tools comparable to dedicated work visas, seen as practical solutions to prevent border management from becoming a structural constraint on the continuity of international road haulage.

The protest continued on 27 January 2026, with the prospect of extending it throughout the week in the absence of negotiating openings. The timeline leading up to the actions of 26 January links them to previous protests in 2025 and to intensified institutional dialogue in the preceding weeks, culminating in warnings issued by some diplomatic representations and foreign ministries of neighbouring countries.

As capital flows heavily toward AI hardware infrastructure, established software firms are facing mounting pressure. In response to this evolving landscape, UBS has revised its outlook for the creative software giant.

As part of a wider sector re-evaluation, UBS analysts have reduced their price target for Adobe. The new target is set at $340, down from the previous $375, though the firm maintains its ""Neutral"" rating on the stock. Market observers note a significant rotation of investment away from pure-play application software and toward underlying infrastructure, a trend influencing this reassessment.

A core concern driving this caution is the competitive threat posed by artificial intelligence. Incumbent companies, including Adobe, are now tasked with demonstrating that their proprietary AI roadmaps are sufficiently robust to fend off new competitors and secure long-term revenue streams.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

Financial Forecasts Hold Steady Despite Headwinds

Adobe's management has reaffirmed its financial guidance despite the challenging environment. For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the company anticipates an earnings per share (EPS) range of $5.85 to $5.90. Its full-year revenue projection of approximately $26.03 billion suggests a growth rate of about 9.5%.

All attention now turns to March 12, 2026. The upcoming quarterly results will serve as a critical indicator for investors, revealing whether the integration of Adobe's ""Firefly"" AI tools can deliver the anticipated acceleration in growth.

Stock Performance Reflects Investor Hesitation

This climate of uncertainty is clearly visible in the share price performance. Closing at $303.49 on Monday, Adobe's stock has declined roughly 9% since the start of the year. The current price sits significantly below its 52-week high of $445.25, highlighting a pronounced correction phase.

ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Elavon, a wholly owned subsidiary of U.S. Bank and one of the world's largest payment processors, is collaborating with Microsoft to introduce Elavon Live Payments, a groundbreaking payments app for Microsoft 365 offered through the Microsoft Marketplace.

Driven by the omni-channel capabilities of the Elavon Payments Gateway (EPG), Elavon Live Payments enables businesses and professional service providers to securely send invoices and collect customer payments with just a few clicks on a computer or mobile device. That means reducing the friction associated with old-school business payment processes and fewer days waiting for money owed. It is the first major embedded payments expansion on the EPG platform.

“Business professionals waste countless hours switching between multiple platforms to create invoices, send them to clients, and track payments,” said Pari Sawant, global chief product officer at Elavon. “Elavon Live Payments solves this challenge by eliminating traditional payment collection barriers allowing business owners to integrate payment workflows directly into commonly used Microsoft 365 applications like Outlook or Teams in real time, which can reduce Days Sales Outstanding and foster business growth.”

According to the 2024 Professional Services Maturity Benchmark Report for Days Sales Outstanding (DSO), professional service providers often wait five to 15 days longer than other industries to convert credit sales into cash.

Inefficiencies in the collection process may lead to potential cash flow problems, and firms with a higher DSO may face operational challenges as they wait longer to convert their work into revenue, impacting their ability to cover costs or reinvest in the business.

“Microsoft 365 is more than a suite of apps – it’s the foundation for how millions of people work every day,” said Tyler Pichach, Global Head of Banking & Payments Strategy, Microsoft. “By embedding Elavon Live Payments directly into familiar Microsoft 365 experiences like Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Teams, we’re helping businesses streamline productivity and simplify payment workflows. And through Microsoft Marketplace, our single destination to find, try, buy, and deploy cloud solutions, Microsoft 365 users can quickly and easily access Elavon Live Payments.”

Key Features & Benefits Include:

Built for Microsoft 365

No need to switch between applications or platforms

In December, a staff report to council recommended changing the rules to require ride-hailing drivers to share their background checks with the city, bringing them in line with the taxi industry.

Earlier today, councillors voted against the proposal but endorsed a motion to have a committee prepare a report on what other jurisdictions are doing, particularly on training, auditing and compliance.

Uber Canada had opposed the proposed changes, saying Halifax already has the authority to request documents to determine whether ride-hailing drivers are complying with applicable laws.

The company had argued the proposed rules were redundant, full of red tape and would lead to higher fares.

“In the new year, a lot of people start questioning whether their job is offering them what they need.

The metals and minerals trader said this year’s refinancing brought an increase of US$135mn to the committed unsecured facility, now in its sixteenth year, following 2025’s US$230mn RCF.

Seven new banks joined the syndicate, which now counts 24 international lenders from around the world, while “several lenders” increased their commitment.

Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) acted as the sole active coordinator of the syndication, as well as joint mandated lead arranger and bookrunner alongside Deutsche Bank. The German lender also served as the facility agent.

Crédit Agricole’s coverage banker, Alexandre Laguian, said: “We are delighted to have closed this facility at an increased amount compared to the previous year, reflecting the robust fundamentals of Gerald Group’s metals business, the strength of our longstanding client relationship, and the excellent collaboration between all parties involved.

“We are particularly pleased to welcome seven new participants to the syndicate, including First Abu Dhabi PJSC and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC, who have joined directly at the bookrunner and mandated lead arranger level. This further underscores the market’s confidence in Gerald Group,” Laguian added.

The increased commitments come amid a boom in metals and minerals markets, partly driven by geopolitical competition for critical minerals used in AI technologies and decarbonisation efforts.

“We are very pleased with the exceptionally strong outcome of this year’s refinancing, which further enhances our financial flexibility in today’s dynamic market environment,” said Patricia Nikolopoulos, Gerald Group’s chief financial officer.

Airoldi,,,,,https://www.businesstravelnews.com/Transportation/Air/Delta-Launches-New-Delta-Business-Site,"Delta Air Lines has launched the new Delta Business site that will replace the Delta Professional platform, the carrier announced Tuesday.
The new site, which Delta previewed last August, will roll out to customers through February.
Reid said 40 early pilot customers praised the new site's simplicity and functionality, and called it ""a significant improvement"" over Delta Professional.
The new site after customer login offers a dashboard, ""which is truly a one-stop-shop for a quick comprehensive view of your entire Delta Business experience,"" Reid said.
The new site also includes operational performance metrics for Delta and its major competitors, including completion factor, on-time performance and mishandled bags.","Delta Air Lines has launched the new Delta Business site that will replace the Delta Professional platform, the carrier announced Tuesday. The new site, which Delta previewed last August, will roll out to customers through February.

Delta managing director of sales and distribution innovation Sara Reid, who demoed the platform for BTN, said some of the platform travel agency functionality will be developed through 2026.

Reid said 40 early pilot customers praised the new site's simplicity and functionality, and called it ""a significant improvement"" over Delta Professional.

The new site after customer login offers a dashboard, ""which is truly a one-stop-shop for a quick comprehensive view of your entire Delta Business experience,"" Reid said.

The dashboard includes a ""wallet"" that tracks three types of benefits:

Loyalty tokens, used to award medallion status

Amenity points, used for ticket purchases, changes or upgrades

Service points, used for unused ticket transfer fees and in the future to track agency actions ""as it relates to exceptions and things like that,"" Reid said.

As customers navigate through the site, the wallet will remain in the top right-hand corner.

Delta also introduced a ""partnership value"" figure that includes a customer's contract value—including global account savings, the total of a customer's service and amenity points—and their experience value. The latter figure includes loyalty tokens and experiences like corporate priority, preferred seats—which corporate customers have complimentary access to—and free Wi-Fi, ""which a lot of business travelers do pay for with other airlines,"" Reid said.

Delta is using the last 12 months of data to display in that area, Reid said.

Customers also will be able to complete ""quick actions"" to assess status, like unused tickets, for example, without leaving the dashboard. Eventually, Reid said, this feature could be used to resolve in-trip issues. In the future, ""you could as a travel manager or agency click to be able to give [a traveler at an airport] access to a drink voucher or something like that,"" Reid said. ""Our intent long-term is to upgrade the travel experience for customers through quick actions from the site.""

A new contract performance section allows users to track progress against their negotiated goals, including specific markets, Reid added.

""This is a level of transparency that we haven't really provided, but customers have been asking for, and we're really excited to be able to deliver it in a way that's very intuitive and actionable ... giving customers a clear view of performance and value,"" she said. ""We also want to shift into loyalty where they can get a deeper look into how their travelers are engaging with Delta and how they can strategically use this new wallet, specifically their loyalty tokens.""

In addition, customers will be able to see their travelers' loyalty status breakdown, including percentage who are SkyMiles members and their distribution across Medallion tiers. ""This is something that we've provided on reports before, but never alongside this wallet capability,"" Reid added.

The ability to use service points to waive the unused ticket transfer fee ""is one of the biggest wins"" for customers, ""as we heard a lot about the fee, so we incorporated that into the design,"" Reid said. Based on a customer suggestion, corporate clients now can choose to direct the value of unused tickets toward the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel.

Companies can use amenity points to support travelers with new tickets, ticket changes and see upgrades. ""This is the first time customers can initiate a seat upgrade without having to call into our global sales solutions center,"" Reid noted.

The new site also includes operational performance metrics for Delta and its major competitors, including completion factor, on-time performance and mishandled bags. Customers also can view their upcoming meetings and events, a section that ""we're looking to enhance even more this year,"" Reid said.

Reid acknowledged the data and reporting section of the site is ""still a work in progress,"" but said ""customers won't lose access to the reporting they have today"" while Delta invests in expanded analytics during the next 12 months.

As for support, customers will have the ability to chat directly with global sales solutions specialists from the homepage after login, Reid said.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTN/uploadedImages/2015_Site_Maintenance/BTN_Link_PreviewLogo.png?n=3260&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2026-01-27 13:10:31.139733

The company’s Storefront Pro, an enterprise commerce platform, now facilitates advanced e-commerce functions and offers Carrot Ads retail media tools to these retailers.

Instacart's AI-driven Caper Carts have already been deployed in locations such as Foodtown of Mt. Vernon, NY; Red Bank, NJ; and East Stroudsburg, PA, with further installations anticipated by 2026. In conjunction with AppCard, Allegiance’s loyalty program, Instacart plans to provide a seamless integration of loyalty rewards and digital promotions, enhancing both online and in-store customer experiences.

Maplebear Inc, operating as Instacart, is a grocery-focused delivery marketplace that connects national and regional grocers with consumers and couriers, and consumers with their favorite stores.

Instacart operates within the Consumer Cyclical sector and the Retail - Cyclical industry. The company boasts a market capitalization of $10.59 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the market.

Financial Health Analysis

Instacart's financial health is underscored by its impressive revenue growth and profitability metrics:

Revenue: $3.63 billion, with a 3-year growth rate of 20.8%.

Operating Margin: 15.3%, indicating efficient cost management.

Net Margin: 14.15%, reflecting strong profitability.

Gross Margin: 74.46%, showcasing robust pricing power.

The company's balance sheet is fortified by a current ratio of 3.64 and a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.01, indicating strong liquidity and minimal leverage. The Altman Z-Score of 6.56 further underscores its financial stability, while insider selling activity, with 17,949 shares sold over the past three months, warrants monitoring.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Instacart's valuation metrics suggest the stock is trading near historical lows, which may present opportunities for investors:

P/E Ratio: 22.17, close to its 3-year low of 20.19.

Risk Assessment

Instacart's financial health is robust, as evidenced by its strong Altman Z-Score and Beneish M-Score of -2.84, suggesting it is unlikely to be a manipulator.

The stock's volatility of 37.7% and beta of 0 indicate a relatively stable trading environment.

In conclusion, while Instacart's recent collaboration with Allegiance Retail Services enhances its market position, its financial metrics and valuation suggest potential opportunities for investors.

Plug Power-Aktie: Elektrolyseure in portugiesischer Raffinerie installiert

Kürzlich konnte das US-Unternehmen einen Meilenstein melden. Demnach hat Plug Power die Installation von 100 Megawatt GenEco‑Elektrolyseuren in der Sines‑Raffinerie des portugiesischen Energiekonzerns Galp Energia abgeschlossen. Das Projekt zählt zu den größten grünen Wasserstoffvorhaben Europas. Seit der ersten Lieferung im Oktober 2025 wurden alle zehn 10‑MW‑Module installiert; die Inbetriebnahme soll in den kommenden Monaten beginnen.

Nach dem Start soll die Anlage jährlich bis zu 15.000 Tonnen grünen Wasserstoff erzeugen. Damit kann Galp rund 20 Prozent seines bisherigen grauen Wasserstoffs ersetzen und dem Unternehmen zufolge 110.000 Tonnen CO2 pro Jahr einsparen. Laut Plug‑Manager Jose Luis Crespo zeigt das Projekt, wie großskalige Wasserstoffproduktion inzwischen technisch und praktisch umsetzbar sei. Für Europa sei die Installation ein „entscheidender Moment“ der Energiewende.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Plug Power?

Für Galp wiederum ist die Anlage ein wichtiger Schritt, um künftig kohlenstoffarme Kraftstoffe herzustellen und industrielle Prozesse zu dekarbonisieren, die sich nicht elektrifizieren lassen. Plug verweist zudem auf seine globale Lieferkette und die modulare PEM‑Technologie, die den schnellen Aufbau großer Elektrolysekapazitäten ermöglicht.

The grocery technology company, which boasts impressive gross profit margins of 74.46% and is currently trading at $40.35, appears undervalued according to InvestingPro analysis.

The expanded collaboration includes the deployment of Instacart’s AI-powered Caper Carts at select Foodtown locations in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, with additional rollouts planned throughout 2026.

Instacart’s Storefront Pro commerce platform is now active across all Allegiance retailers, providing e-commerce capabilities and retail media tools. The partnership also includes integration with AppCard, Allegiance’s loyalty provider, to unify rewards and promotions across online and in-store shopping experiences.

""By aligning e-commerce, loyalty, and in-store innovation, we’re helping independent grocers meet evolving customer expectations while strengthening their competitive position,"" said Donna Zambo, EVP and CMO at Allegiance Retail Services.

The technology integration extends to FoodStorm, Instacart’s order management system for catering and prepared foods, with additional store implementations scheduled for early 2026. Carrot Tags, Instacart’s electronic shelf label software, will be deployed in later phases.

In other recent news, Instacart has agreed to pay $60 million in refunds to consumers following allegations from the Federal Trade Commission regarding deceptive practices. This settlement requires Instacart to cease these practices and provide refunds to those charged for Instacart+ without informed consent. Additionally, the company faces scrutiny from the New York Attorney General over its algorithmic pricing practices, which were found to cause significant price disparities for identical products. Meanwhile, Instacart is also dealing with increased competition as Amazon announced an expansion of its same-day grocery delivery service to over 2,300 cities in the United States.

With the launch of AV Labs, the company aims to harvest rare, “long-tail” driving scenarios from its massive fleet to train third-party autonomous systems.

The focus is shifting from algorithm-centric development to a data-centric model, where the competitive advantage lies not in the software architecture, but in access to high-volume, real-world anomalies that cannot be simulated.

The AV sector is currently moving away from rules-based logic toward reinforcement learning; where data quality outweighs quantity. While companies often use simulations to hedge against risks, synthetic environments fail to replicate the unpredictability of actual public roads.

Recent operational struggles highlight this gap. Waymo, despite a decade of testing, has seen its robotaxis struggle with specific real-world scenarios, such as illegally passing stopped school buses. Fleet size creates a physical ceiling on how much data any single AV company can capture independently.

Uber is positioning AV Labs to fill this void. The company is not returning to robotaxi development (which it exited in 2020 after selling its division to Aurora) but is instead offering an infrastructure layer to partners like Waymo, Waabi, and Lucid Motors.

Targeted data harvesting using the Uber fleet

The core proposition is a data flywheel capable of capturing scenarios that are difficult to programme explicitly. Unlike Tesla, which relies on passive data collection from millions of consumer vehicles, Uber plans to use a targeted approach.

The new division can deploy sensor-laden vehicles to specific locations based on partner requirements. Danny Guo, Uber’s VP of Engineering, noted that the company can select from 600 cities for deployment, allowing them to target specific locations based on partner interest.

This operation is currently in a scrappy prototype phase. The team is manually outfitting vehicles (currently a Hyundai Ioniq 5) with lidars, radars, and cameras. Guo admitted the team is still determining the durability of these manual sensor installations, characterising the project’s current state as highly experimental.

Shadow mode validation

The technical implementation offers a distinct use case for validation teams: shadow mode. In this configuration, a partner’s autonomous driving software runs silently in the background of a human-driven vehicle from the Uber fleet.

When the human driver’s action diverges from the software’s decision, the system flags the discrepancy. This feedback loop serves two functions: it identifies shortcomings in the code and provides training data to align the model’s behaviour with human driving norms.

Partners will not receive raw data feeds. Instead, AV Labs processes the intake into a semantic understanding layer designed to improve real-time path planning.

Uber’s strategy is to become a utility provider for the autonomy ecosystem rather than a direct competitor. By democratising access to edge-case data, the company aims to accelerate the wider industry.

For the AV industry, this collaboration offers a way to bypass the capital-intensive process of building the kind of massive validation fleet that Uber already has. Guo argued that Uber must accept the responsibility of unlocking the ecosystem because the volume of data they can collect far exceeds what individual partners can generate independently.

By the early 2020s, strong seaborne car trade – especially from Japan, Korea and a rapidly expanding China export base – pushed owners to order larger tonnage. Today’s mega PCTCs routinely reach 8,500-9,500.

This growth has been driven by larger and heavier vehicles such as SUVs, pick‑ups, and EVs with big battery packs as well as, pressure to lower unit freight costs, and tighter emissions rules favouring newer, more efficient hulls, sometimes LNG‑ or methanol‑ready.

In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, the company highlighted how AI is already being used across technology, digital commerce and internal operations to make everyday work easier and more efficient. These tools are helping cut down manual effort, speed up processes and improve how teams get things done.

One clear example is software development. During the third quarter, more than 40% of new code was either generated or supported by AI. This points to faster development cycles and better productivity across Walmart’s technology teams. To make sure employees can use these tools effectively, the company has rolled out ChatGPT enterprise licenses along with AI-focused training programs, helping workers build skills and apply AI in their daily work.

AI is also playing a growing role in how customers shop online. Walmart is working toward a more personalized and conversational e-commerce experience that blends voice, text, image and video. The goal is to better understand what shoppers are looking for, offer more relevant suggestions and save time along the way. Advertising is expected to be more relevant and helpful, appearing as recommendations or sponsored bundles.

AI and automation are supporting efficiency gains across operations as well. The company pointed to technology-driven improvements in supply chain and fulfillment, which are helping boost productivity and lower the cost to serve.

As AI becomes more deeply embedded across the business, these efficiency gains are increasingly supporting cost control, suggesting that technology-led productivity could help support margin performance over time.

In a market where board oversight now spans cyber risk, activist pressure, capital discipline, and AI governance all at once, who sits in the boardroom matters more than ever. Today, JamesDruryPartners, a leading management consulting firm specializing in corporate board advisory services, released the 2026 edition of The Weight of America's Boards, its annual benchmark of how well America's largest public-company boards are built for modern governance.

For more than sixteen years, The Weight of America's Boards has tracked how board composition evolves as expectations on directors rise. The 2026 edition captures a clear shift in boardrooms: governance capacity is increasingly tied to directors with real operating and financial accountability, particularly CEOs, CFOs, and senior leaders with direct P&L ownership. Companies are responding to rising complexity by prioritizing leaders who have carried decision-making responsibility when outcomes and reputations were on the line.

The 2026 report evaluates governance capacity using Average Director Weight (ADW), an objective measure of the experience and business judgment represented on a board. JamesDruryPartners analyzed 6,264 directors serving on 654 public company boards, covering the 500 largest U.S. companies by revenue and the 500 largest by market capitalization. Boards with the strongest ADW scores consistently reflect a higher concentration of CEOs, CFOs, and senior leaders with direct P&L responsibility. Based on this analysis, Arrow Electronics, Uber Technologies and Elevance Health ranked highest in overall board governance capacity.

Top 10 Corporations with the Highest Average Director Weight (ADW):

Arrow Electronics

Uber Technologies

Elevance Health

Starbucks

Waste Management

PTC Inc.

Honeywell

Adobe

Parker-Hannifin

PPG Industries

These boards demonstrate the deepest concentration of executive leadership and serve as reference points for governance capacity among large public companies.

'Effective governance starts with real-world operating and financial experience,' said James Drury III, Chairman and CEO of JamesDruryPartners. 'Boards are being asked to make harder decisions, faster, and under greater scrutiny. CEOs and CFOs bring a level of judgment and accountability that is difficult to substitute, particularly as the pool of active executives willing to serve continues to narrow.'

Key findings: experience is thinning as the workload expands

Beyond the rankings, the numbers point to some practical constraints inside America's modern boardrooms:

34% of directors are active executives, while 66% are retired from their primary careers.

Outside active CFOs remain relatively scarce, appearing on only 16.1% of boards

62% of Audit Committee members meet the SEC's definition of a Financial Expert.

As boards take on more responsibility for capital decisions, controls, and risk, these figures highlight where experience may be thinner than the workload now requires.

AI oversight is rising, but boards are not solving it by adding narrow specialists

The study also looks at how boards are responding to the growing influence of artificial intelligence. Just 21% of boards currently include a director with explicit AI experience, but most companies are not trying to solve that gap by adding technical specialists. Instead, AI oversight is being handled by directors with deep operating and financial backgrounds, particularly CEOs, CFOs, and senior business leaders. Responsibility tends to sit within existing committee structures, mirroring how AI shows up across the business rather than in one isolated function. Boards with higher Average Director Weight appear better prepared for these discussions, relying on business judgment and financial discipline rather than narrow technical credentials.

A benchmark and a decision tool for nominating committees

As companies plan for the year ahead, the 2026 edition of The Weight of America's Boards is designed to function as both a benchmark and a decision tool for boards and nominating committees. With governance demands continuing to intensify, board composition is becoming a more consequential determinant of oversight effectiveness.

'Boards won't have the luxury of passive oversight in 2026,' said Jim Drury IV, Co-Managing Director of JamesDruryPartners. 'This research helps boards pressure-test a simple question: does our composition match the weight we are being asked to carry.'

As of Monday evening, about 24% of outbound flights from Cleveland were canceled, along with 21% of arrivals, according to FlightAware.
In total, the storm triggered nearly 13,000 flight cancellations and more than 22,000 delays on Sunday.
Cleveland Hopkins International Airport said: “During this weekend’s storm, we were fully staffed and successfully kept both landside and airside operations open and passable.
As of now, there are some cancellations and delays because of the winter storm.","CLEVELAND — Airlines are working to restore normal operations after this weekend’s winter storm caused widespread flight cancellations and delays across the country, including at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.

As of Monday evening, about 24% of outbound flights from Cleveland were canceled, along with 21% of arrivals, according to FlightAware. While conditions have improved since Sunday’s storm, travelers are still seeing ripple.

In total, the storm triggered nearly 13,000 flight cancellations and more than 22,000 delays on Sunday. There were 11,615 flights into and out of the United States canceled and 6,155 delayed.

Delta Air Lines was among the hardest hit, with almost half of its flights canceled that day, according to FlightAware.

One Northeast Ohio traveler said he was surprised his flight made it through.

“Images that we saw were catastrophic,” said Giles Mulard, who lives in Madison.

Mulard flew out of South Africa on Sunday and landed in Atlanta early Monday morning. Despite concerns about weather advisories, he said the flight landed safely.

“We were surprised we could land because we were told we had the advisory,” Mulard said.

His connecting Delta flight from Atlanta — the airline’s largest hub — to Cleveland was delayed by just 10 minutes. Mulard noticed something unusual while taxiing.

“Usually you have a long line of planes, there were no planes, so we assumed that there were a lot of cancellations,” he said.

Here in Cleveland, the impact was significant on Sunday. About 44% of outbound flights from Hopkins were canceled, and 36% were delayed. For inbound flights, 43% were canceled and 25% were delayed, according to FlightAware.

That made Mulard’s arrival feel especially fortunate.

“By the grace of God, it’s good to be back in Cleveland,” he said.

Airlines say recovery efforts are underway, but some disruptions may continue.

In a statement, Delta Air Lines said:

“Delta continues to make steady progress recovering from this weekend’s Winter Storm Fern, with flights resuming across key hubs in Atlanta and the Northeast as teams work safely and efficiently through residual weather impacts. Operations in the Northeast are expected to restart through late morning and midday, with service resuming around noon at New York–LaGuardia, New York–JFK and Boston, while Atlanta is seeing a stable recovery as our largest hub. Travel waivers remain in place, and customers traveling today are encouraged to check the Delta app or Delta.com for the latest flight status information.”

Southwest Airlines said customers should continue monitoring their flights:

“We encourage Customers to check Southwest.com and the Southwest app for the latest updates on weather-related delays and cancelations. Our travel advisory lists affected airports in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic and provides flexibility to accommodate our Customers.”

JetBlue said it is gradually restoring service after the storm:

“After Winter Storm Fern brought heavy snow and wintry conditions to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, we are focused on safely resuming our flight schedule, including in New York and Boston, our two largest focus cities impacted by the storm.

We plan to resume some flying in New York and Boston today as we work toward restoring our normal schedule. Given the large number of cancellations, we have added more than 35 extra flights across Monday and Tuesday to help customers with rebooking their travel and are looking for opportunities to add more.

The safety of our customers and crewmembers remains our top priority. We appreciate our customers’ continued patience and understanding, and we encourage them to check their flight status at jetblue.com or via the JetBlue mobile app before heading to the airport.”

United Airlines said it is also ramping operations back up:

“United will begin restoring its flight operations on Monday, following widespread cancellations on Sunday. While we expect significantly fewer cancellations on Monday as weather conditions improve, our teams in some parts of the country will have challenges with icy conditions, ongoing cold, and other residual impacts from this winter weather.

As always, United teams will put safety first as we take care of customers and each other. We’ll continue to communicate schedule changes as soon as possible so customers can change their plans with the flexibility offered by United’s weather waiver.”

Local airports say they were prepared for the storm.

Cleveland Hopkins International Airport said:

“During this weekend’s storm, we were fully staffed and successfully kept both landside and airside operations open and passable. Although conditions at times made it challenging to keep pace with the snowfall, staff performed exceptionally well by focusing on what they could control and recovering quickly after each significant accumulation.

Airlines cancelled flights in advance of the storm, resulting in light passenger traffic, as most guests were aware ahead of time not to travel to the airport.

Delays and cancellations at CLE were consistent with those experienced across the region.”

Akron-Canton Airport said weather-related disruptions there were limited:

“The airport snow removal team worked diligently throughout this weather event to keep the airport safe, open and operational. They did an exceptional job, and we are very proud of them.

As of now, there are some cancellations and delays because of the winter storm. None of the delays or cancelations are reflective of conditions at CAK.

Airlines will work with their customers to best reaccommodate them.

Over the next few days, travelers should check with their air carrier before heading to the airport. Even if flights are not impacted to or from CAK, there may be weather elsewhere that could change travel agendas.

We recommend signing up for text alerts or downloading the airline app for real-time updates.”

Several airlines, including Southwest and American, continue to list Cleveland Hopkins under travel alerts, meaning flights could still be delayed, diverted or canceled. Travelers may be eligible to change flights within a specific time frame without a fee.",https://media.wkyc.com/assets/WKYC/images/1f4d5331-84e2-4ec1-b4a9-130e73a1768b/20260126T234325/1f4d5331-84e2-4ec1-b4a9-130e73a1768b_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 19:02:52.692427

Am 11. Februar legt die Commerzbank ihre Q4-2025-Ergebnisse vor. Neben den reinen Zahlen dürfte vor allem der Ausblick für 2026 Aufmerksamkeit erhalten. Die Bank hatte zuletzt im Dezember 2025 ihr fünftes Aktienrückkaufprogramm seit 2023 abgeschlossen – im Volumen von einer Milliarde Euro.

Der vollständige Geschäftsbericht folgt am 25. März, die Hauptversammlung ist für den 20. Mai terminiert.

Die Aktie notiert aktuell bei 34,87 Euro und damit deutlich unter dem 52-Wochen-Hoch von 41,58 Euro. UniCredit hatte ihren Anteil seit September 2024 systematisch aufgebaut und dabei vom Teilausstieg des Bundes profitiert. Der deutsche Staat hält weiterhin rund 12 Prozent.

Stratasys often talks about additive manufacturing as “the new industrial literacy.” For Roitenberg, that shift became clear more than a decade ago.

“I’ve been with the company for 20 years, and about 13 years ago we started hearing it from customers and partners,” he said. “Certifications were emerging. Students wanted credentials. Schools were being asked to teach engineering and manufacturing without enough preparation. That’s when it stopped being just a cool tool and started becoming something people needed.”

Training the teachers first

One of the biggest mistakes schools make, Roitenberg explained, is buying a 3D printer without building a real program around it.

“A lot of schools get a printer and think they can only do one thing with it. They don’t realize the power of it: design, nursing, microfluidics, chemistry. All these areas can use this technology.”

That realization pushed Stratasys to build its education certifications: not to train students directly, but to train educators.

“We didn’t build it to sell training,” said Roitenberg. “We built it so educators are confident. They understand when to print, when not to print, what material to use, and what technology to use.”

That confidence matters. Schools that use certification-based programs end up using their machines more effectively and even calling for less technical support. As the expert noted, they understand the printers better, and they teach that knowledge to students.

From classroom to factory floor

Roitenberg now sees something unexpected happening: industrial companies using educational content to train their own employees.

“We’ve had companies like Rivian, Polaris, Parker Hannifin reach out,” he indicated. “They’re asking, ‘Who’s teaching this? Where is our next workforce coming from?’ In some cases, companies don’t even pursue the formal certification. They adapt the material into internal training programs because they want people to understand where additive fits, how it helps, and when it makes sense.”

Roitenberg described his role as part connector, part translator: “I joke that I’m like ‘match.com.’ We connect people who love additive with companies that need it.”

Seeing the impact up close

Because Roitenberg spends much of his time visiting schools, he often sees firsthand how AM changes the way students learn and work. For example, at the University of Southern California, he walked into a Formula SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) lab and met a student working on a race car. She wasn’t using AM yet, but after Stratasys provided materials, that changed.

“A year and a half later, she reached out from her new job at an EV company and told me they were using low-end printers, but that her experience working with Ultem showed they needed more capable systems,” Roitenberg remarked.

“That moment captures the problem,” he said. “If students only use PLA, they think 3D printing is just 3D printing. They don’t understand how materials change everything.”

Meanwhile, at the University of Minnesota, Roitenberg saw how 3D printed anatomical models are being used to educate students and encourage organ donation. By scanning real organs and reproducing them physically, programs can show students the real impact of disease on the body, making the learning experience far more tangible than images on a screen.

This approach is also reducing reliance on cadavers. Because most available cadavers come from much older donors, 3D printing allows educators to simulate younger bodies instead, an essential shift for medical training, military applications, and even veterinary science.

The biggest misconception about manufacturing

When asked about the skills gap, Roitenberg focused on how manufacturing is still misunderstood.

“People still think manufacturing is dirty, low-skilled. Pushing brooms. That couldn’t be more wrong. In fact, modern manufacturing requires creativity, programming, automation, and problem-solving. In one school I work with, every student must design, 3D print, and program a robotic end effector. That integration is the key,” he said. “Manufacturing today is high-level thinking.”

He sees the same mindset in robotics competitions such as FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology), where students learn to work within constraints and solve real engineering problems.

Roitenberg is especially enthusiastic about community and technical colleges. He explains that “They adapt quickly. They listen to industry advisory boards, and their students graduate and go straight into those companies.”

In some regions, community colleges are even producing parts for industrial partners. These schools already have trained technicians and hands-on additive experience, while many companies are still in the process of building those capabilities internally. The relationship gives students real-world exposure and helps companies bridge the gap.

What schools risk by waiting

Stratasys updates its education certifications every year: new materials, new technologies, new use cases.

In 2026, the company plans to roll out a Level 2 certification focused on PolyJet, with strong ties to healthcare. Future modules will focus on tooling, manufacturing, aerospace, drones, and dental applications.

“This industry changes fast,” Roitenberg said. “We have to keep listening.”

Meanwhile, for schools that still see 3D printing as optional, Roitenberg’s message is: “If you don’t build it into your curriculum, you’re losing students.”

Near the end of the conversation, Roitenberg shared a story that captured the human side of additive: a high school student who used 3D printing to create parts for her prom dress as a way to raise awareness about mental health after losing a friend to suicide.

Rather than designing the dress alone, the student asked her classmates, especially those affected by mental health issues, what they wanted in the design. She then used 3D printing to create custom elements that carried those messages into the finished dress. For Roitenberg, the project showed how AM can give students a way to translate personal experiences into something tangible that they can also share.

That’s the real takeaway, he told me: “Additive manufacturing isn’t just about machines or materials. It’s about giving students tools to solve problems and the confidence to use them. And when you see that, you know we’ll be okay.”",https://3dprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC00088.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:12:38.127715

The full U.S. Prescribing Information for MYQORZO includes a Boxed WARNING for the risk of heart failure. MYQORZO reduces left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and can cause heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. Echocardiogram assessments are required prior to and during treatment with MYQORZO to monitor for systolic dysfunction. Initiation of MYQORZO in patients LVEF <55% is not recommended. Decrease the dose of MYQORZO if LVEF <50% and ≥40%. Interrupt the dose of MYQORZO if LVEF <40% or if the patient experiences heart failure symptoms or worsening clinical status due to systolic dysfunction. Because of the risk of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, MYQORZO is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the MYQORZO REMS Program. Please see additional Important Safety Information including Boxed WARNING below.

Cytokinetics received U.S. FDA approval for MYQORZO on December 19, 2025. The approval was based on the positive results from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, SEQUOIA-HCM, published in the New England Journal of Medicine . 1

Cytokinetics is committed to supporting patients with MYQORZO & You™, a personalized program for patients prescribed MYQORZO in the U.S. to help navigate the treatment journey, provide disease and product education, and offer support with insurance benefits investigations or financial assistance for those eligible.

INDICATION

MYQORZO is indicated for the treatment of adults with symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) to improve functional capacity and symptoms.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

WARNING: RISK OF HEART FAILURE

MYQORZO reduces left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and can cause heart failure due to systolic dysfunction.

Echocardiogram assessments are required prior to and during treatment with MYQORZO to monitor for systolic dysfunction. Initiation of MYQORZO in patients with LVEF <55% is not recommended. Decrease the dose of MYQORZO if LVEF is <50% and ≥40%. Interrupt the dose of MYQORZO if LVEF <40% or if the patient experiences heart failure symptoms or worsening clinical status due to systolic dysfunction .

Because of the risk of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction, MYQORZO is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the MYQORZO REMS Program.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

MYQORZO is contraindicated with concomitant use of rifampin.

WARNING AND PRECAUTIONS

Heart Failure

MYQORZO reduces cardiac contractility, which can reduce LVEF and cause heart failure.

Patients who experience a serious intercurrent illness (eg, serious infection) or arrhythmia (eg, new or uncontrolled atrial fibrillation) may be at greater risk of developing systolic dysfunction and heart failure.

Assess patients’ clinical status and LVEF prior to and during treatment and adjust the MYQORZO dose accordingly. New or worsening arrhythmia, dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, leg edema, or elevations in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide may be signs and symptoms of heart failure.

Initiation of MYQORZO in patients with LVEF <55% is not recommended.

MYQORZO REMS Program

MYQORZO is available only through a restricted program called the MYQORZO REMS Program, because of the risk of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction.

Notable requirements of the MYQORZO REMS Program include:

Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the MYQORZO REMS Program

Patients must enroll in the MYQORZO REMS Program and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements

Pharmacies must be certified by enrolling in the MYQORZO REMS Program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive MYQORZO

Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies

Further information is available at www.MYQORZOREMS.com , or at 1-844-285-7367.

Cytochrome P450 Interactions Leading to Heart Failure or Loss of Effectiveness

MYQORZO is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 enzymes. Initiation of medications that inhibit multiple P450 pathways of MYQORZO elimination (eg, fluconazole, voriconazole, or fluvoxamine) or strong CYP2C9 inhibitors, and discontinuation of moderate-to-strong CYP3A inducers may lead to increased blood concentrations of aficamten and increase the risk of heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. Conversely, initiation of medications that induce P450 pathways of MYQORZO (eg, rifampin, moderate-to-strong CYP3A inducers) may lead to decreased blood concentrations of aficamten and potential loss of effectiveness. Assess LVEF 2 to 8 weeks after initiation of such inhibitors or after discontinuation of such inducers and adjust the dose of MYQORZO accordingly.

Advise patients of the potential for drug interactions. Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of all concomitant medications prior to and during MYQORZO treatment.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Hypertension (8% vs 2%) was the only adverse reaction occurring in >5% of patients and more commonly on MYQORZO than on placebo in the pivotal trial.

Please see full Prescribing Information , including Boxed WARNING and Medication Guide .

About MYQORZO™ ( aficamten )

MYQORZO™ ( aficamten ) is a cardiac myosin inhibitor approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of symptomatic obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM) to improve functional capacity and symptoms. MYQORZO is an allosteric and reversible inhibitor of cardiac myosin motor activity. In patients with HCM, myosin inhibition with MYQORZO reduces cardiac contractility and left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. MYQORZO was engineered to achieve a predictable exposure response, rapid onset of action and reversibility. 2

On December 17, 2025, the China National Medical Products Administration approved MYQORZO® ( aficamten ) for the treatment of oHCM. On December 12, 2025, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion recommending marketing authorization in the European Union for MYQORZO® ( aficamten ) with a decision expected from the European Commission in the first quarter of 2026.

Aficamten is also under clinical investigation in ACACIA-HCM, a Phase 3 trial in patients with non-obstructive HCM (nHCM) and CEDAR-HCM, in a pediatric population with oHCM. Aficamten has not been deemed safe or effective for use in either of these patient populations. In addition, aficamten is being studied in FOREST-HCM, an open-label extension clinical study.

About Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a disease in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick. HCM can be obstructive, when thickened muscle blocks blood flow, or non-obstructive, when blood flow is not blocked but heart function is still affected. In obstructive HCM, the thickening of cardiac muscle leads to the inside of the left ventricle becoming smaller, stiffer and less able to relax and fill with blood. Ultimately, HCM limits the heart’s pumping function, leading to reduced exercise capacity and a variety of symptoms.

HCM is the most common monogenic inherited cardiovascular disorder, with well over 300,000 patients diagnosed in the U.S. 3 However, there are an estimated 400,000-800,000 additional patients who remain undiagnosed. 4 , 5 , 6 Approximately half of patients with HCM have obstructive HCM (oHCM) and half have non-obstructive HCM (nHCM). 3

People with HCM are at high risk of also developing cardiovascular complications including atrial fibrillation, stroke and mitral valve disease. 7 People with HCM are at risk for potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmias and it is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death in younger people or athletes. 8 A subset of patients with HCM are at high risk of progressive disease leading to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure necessitating cardiac transplantation.

ABOUT THE ULTIMATE I & II PHASE 3 TRIALS

ULTIMATE I & II are two randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group, active comparator-controlled clinical trials of identical design, in patients with RMS treated for 96 weeks. Patients were randomized to receive either BRIUMVI, given as an IV infusion of 150 mg administered in four hours, 450 mg two weeks after the first infusion administered in one hour, and 450 mg every 24 weeks administered in one hour, with oral placebo administered daily; or teriflunomide, the active comparator, given orally as a 14 mg daily dose with IV placebo administered on the same schedule as BRIUMVI. Both studies enrolled patients who had experienced at least one relapse in the previous year, two relapses in the previous two years, or had the presence of a T1 gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesion in the previous year. Patients were also required to have an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score from 0 to 5.5 at baseline. The ULTIMATE I & II trials enrolled a total of 1,094 patients with RMS across 10 countries. These trials were led by Lawrence Steinman, MD, Zimmermann Professor of Neurology & Neurological Sciences, and Pediatrics at Stanford University. Additional information on these clinical trials can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03277261; NCT03277248).

ABOUT BRIUMVI ® (ublituximab-xiiy) 150 mg/6 mL Injection for IV

BRIUMVI is a novel monoclonal antibody that targets a unique epitope on CD20-expressing B-cells. Targeting CD20 using monoclonal antibodies has proven to be an important therapeutic approach for the management of autoimmune disorders, such as RMS. BRIUMVI is uniquely designed to lack certain sugar molecules normally expressed on the antibody. Removal of these sugar molecules, a process called glycoengineering, allows for efficient B-cell depletion at low doses.

BRIUMVI is indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of adults with RMS, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease and in several countries outside of the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients with RMS with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Contraindications: BRIUMVI is contraindicated in patients with:

Active Hepatitis B Virus infection

A history of life-threatening infusion reaction to BRIUMVI

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Infusion Reactions: BRIUMVI can cause infusion reactions, which can include pyrexia, chills, headache, influenza-like illness, tachycardia, nausea, throat irritation, erythema, and an anaphylactic reaction. In MS clinical trials, the incidence of infusion reactions in BRIUMVI-treated patients who received infusion reaction-limiting premedication prior to each infusion was 48%, with the highest incidence within 24 hours of the first infusion. 0.6% of BRIUMVI-treated patients experienced infusion reactions that were serious, some requiring hospitalization.

Observe treated patients for infusion reactions during the infusion and for at least one hour after the completion of the first two infusions unless infusion reaction and/or hypersensitivity has been observed in association with the current or any prior infusion. Inform patients that infusion reactions can occur up to 24 hours after the infusion. Administer the recommended pre-medication to reduce the frequency and severity of infusion reactions. If life-threatening, stop the infusion immediately, permanently discontinue BRIUMVI, and administer appropriate supportive treatment. Less severe infusion reactions may involve temporarily stopping the infusion, reducing the infusion rate, and/or administering symptomatic treatment.

Infections: Serious, life-threatening or fatal, bacterial and viral infections have been reported in BRIUMVI-treated patients. In MS clinical trials, the overall rate of infections in BRIUMVI-treated patients was 56% compared to 54% in teriflunomide-treated patients. The rate of serious infections was 5% compared to 3% respectively. There were 3 infection-related deaths in BRIUMVI-treated patients. The most common infections in BRIUMVI-treated patients included upper respiratory tract infection (45%) and urinary tract infection (10%). Delay BRIUMVI administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved.

Consider the potential for increased immunosuppressive effects when initiating BRIUMVI after immunosuppressive therapy or initiating an immunosuppressive therapy after BRIUMVI.

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Reactivation: HBV reactivation occurred in an MS patient treated with BRIUMVI in clinical trials. Fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death caused by HBV reactivation have occurred in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies. Perform HBV screening in all patients before initiation of treatment with BRIUMVI. Do not start treatment with BRIUMVI in patients with active HBV confirmed by positive results for HB surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HB tests. For patients who are negative for HBsAg and positive for HB core antibody [HBcAb+] or are carriers of HBV [HBsAg+], consult a liver disease expert before starting and during treatment.

Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML): PML is an opportunistic viral infection of the brain caused by the JC virus (JCV) that typically only occurs in patients who are immunocompromised, and that usually leads to death or severe disability. JCV infection resulting in PML has been observed in patients treated with anti-CD20 antibodies, including BRIUMVI, and other MS therapies.

If PML is suspected, withhold BRIUMVI and perform an appropriate diagnostic evaluation. Typical symptoms associated with PML are diverse, progress over days to weeks, and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, disturbance of vision, and changes in thinking, memory, and orientation leading to confusion and personality changes.

MRI findings may be apparent before clinical signs or symptoms; monitoring for signs consistent with PML may be useful. Further investigate suspicious findings to allow for an early diagnosis of PML, if present. Following discontinuation of another MS medication associated with PML, lower PML-related mortality and morbidity have been reported in patients who were initially asymptomatic at diagnosis compared to patients who had characteristic clinical signs and symptoms at diagnosis.

If PML is confirmed, treatment with BRIUMVI should be discontinued.

Vaccinations: Administer all immunizations according to immunization guidelines: for live or live-attenuated vaccines, at least 4 weeks and, whenever possible, at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of BRIUMVI for non-live vaccines. BRIUMVI may interfere with the effectiveness of non-live vaccines. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines during or following administration of BRIUMVI has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended during treatment and until B-cell repletion.

Vaccination of Infants Born to Mothers Treated with BRIUMVI During Pregnancy: In infants of mothers exposed to BRIUMVI during pregnancy, assess B-cell counts prior to administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines as measured by CD19 + B-cells. Depletion of B-cells in these infants may increase the risks from live or live-attenuated vaccines. Inactivated or non-live vaccines may be administered prior to B-cell recovery. Assessment of vaccine immune responses, including consultation with a qualified specialist, should be considered to determine whether a protective immune response was mounted.

Fetal Risk: Based on data from animal studies, BRIUMVI may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Transient peripheral B-cell depletion and lymphocytopenia have been reported in infants born to mothers exposed to other anti-CD20 B-cell depleting antibodies during pregnancy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during BRIUMVI treatment and for 6 months after the last dose.

Reduction in Immunoglobulins: As expected with any B-cell depleting therapy, decreased immunoglobulin levels were observed. Decrease in immunoglobulin M (IgM) was reported in 0.6% of BRIUMVI-treated patients compared to none of the patients treated with teriflunomide in RMS clinical trials. Monitor the levels of quantitative serum immunoglobulins during treatment, especially in patients with opportunistic or recurrent infections, and after discontinuation of therapy, until B-cell repletion. Consider discontinuing BRIUMVI therapy if a patient with low immunoglobulins develops a serious opportunistic infection or recurrent infections, or if prolonged hypogammaglobulinemia requires treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins.

Liver Injury: Clinically significant liver injury, without findings of viral hepatitis, has been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with anti-CD20 B-cell depleting therapies approved for the treatment of MS, including BRIUMVI. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes with elevated total bilirubin, have occurred from weeks to months after administration.

Patients treated with BRIUMVI found to have an alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 3x the upper limit of normal (ULN) with serum total bilirubin greater than 2x ULN are potentially at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury.

Obtain liver function tests prior to initiating treatment with BRIUMVI, and monitor for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury during treatment. Measure serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including new or worsening fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. If liver injury is present and an alternative etiology is not identified, discontinue BRIUMVI.

Most Common Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions in RMS trials (incidence of at least 10%) were infusion reactions and upper respiratory tract infections.

ABOUT MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

Relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and includes people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) who continue to experience relapses. RRMS is the most common form of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is characterized by episodes of new or worsening signs or symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of recovery. It is estimated that nearly 1 million people are living with MS in the United States and approximately 85% are initially diagnosed with RRMS. 1,2 The majority of people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to SPMS, in which they experience steadily worsening disability over time. Worldwide, more than 2.3 million people have a diagnosis of MS. 1

PURCHASE, N.Y., Jan. 27, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cognition Therapeutics, Inc. , (the Company or Cognition) (NASDAQ: CGTX), a clinical stage company developing drugs that treat neurodegenerative disorders, conducted a Type C meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on January 21, 2026. The objective of this meeting was to review plans for the proposed Phase 2b study of zervimesine in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), a disease with no FDA-approved therapies.

“We had a productive meeting with the FDA, during which we discussed clinically meaningful endpoints for the next Phase 2b study of mild-to-moderate DLB,” stated Anthony O. Caggiano, MD, PhD , Cognition’s chief medical officer. “We look forward to receiving meeting minutes later this quarter and continuing our dialogue with the FDA to advance clinical development in DLB.”

About Zervimesine (CT1812)

Zervimesine (CT1812) is an investigational, oral, once-daily pill in development for the treatment of CNS diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). While these diseases have different symptoms, both are associated with the buildup of certain proteins in the brain – Aβ and ɑ-synuclein. As these proteins bind to receptors on the surface of neurons, they can damage and ultimately destroy the neurons. This results in a progressive loss in a person’s ability to learn, recall memories, move efficiently, or communicate. These diseases progress relentlessly and ultimately result in death. Zervimesine has been shown to interrupt the toxic effects of Aβ and ɑ-synuclein, which may slow progression of disease and improve the lives of those suffering from Alzheimer’s and DLB. Zervimesine has been generally well tolerated in clinical studies to date.

The USAN Council has adopted zervimesine as the United States Adopted Name (USAN) for CT1812.

About Cognition Therapeutics, Inc.

Cognition Therapeutics, Inc. , is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing innovative, small molecule therapeutics targeting age-related degenerative disorders of the central nervous system. We recently completed Phase 2 studies of our lead candidate, zervimesine (CT1812) in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease and geographic atrophy secondary to dry AMD. The Phase 2 START study ( NCT05531656 ) in early Alzheimer’s disease is ongoing with $81 million in grant support from the National Institute of Aging (NIA) at the National Institutes of Health. We believe zervimesine can regulate pathways that are impaired in these diseases though its interaction with the sigma-2 receptor, a mechanism that is functionally distinct from other approaches for the treatment of degenerative diseases.

Discussion of Operating Results

Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin

Tax-equivalent net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 totaled $43.4 million compared to $43.6 million for the third quarter of 2025 and $41.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, the decrease was due to a $0.7 million decrease in loan income and a $0.5 million increase in interest expense, partially offset by a $0.6 million increase in investment securities income and a $0.4 million increase in overnight funds income. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, the increase was due to a $3.1 million increase in investment securities income, a $0.8 million increase in overnight funds income, and a $0.3 million decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease of $1.8 million in loan income.

For 2025, tax-equivalent net interest income totaled $171.8 million compared to $159.2 million for 2024 with the increase attributable to a $10.3 million increase in investment securities income, a $3.1 million increase in overnight funds income, and a $2.6 million decrease in deposit interest expense, partially offset by a $3.5 million decrease in loan income. New investment purchases at higher yields drove the increase in investment securities income. Higher average deposit balances contributed to the increase in overnight funds income. The decrease in deposit interest expense reflected the decrease in our deposit rates throughout 2025. The decrease in loan income was due to lower loan balances that were partially offset by favorable rate repricing.

Our net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2025 was 4.26%, a decrease of 8 basis points from the third quarter of 2025 and an increase of 9 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2024. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, the decrease in the margin reflected a lower yield on earning assets due to an unfavorable shift in mix and lower interest rates. For 2025, our net interest margin of 4.28% reflected a 20 basis point increase over 2024. The improvement in the net interest margin compared to both prior year periods was primarily due to a higher yield for investment securities driven by new purchases at higher yields, favorable loan repricing, and lower deposit cost. For the fourth quarter of 2025, our cost of funds was 82 basis points, an increase of 4 basis points over the third quarter of 2025 and a 6 basis point decrease from the fourth quarter of 2024. Our cost of deposits (including noninterest bearing accounts) was 82 basis points, 80 basis points, and 86 basis points, respectively, for the same periods.

Provision for Credit Losses

We recorded a provision expense for credit losses of $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to $1.9 million for the third quarter of 2025 and $0.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. For 2025, we recorded a provision expense for credit losses of $5.3 million compared to $4.0 million in 2024. Activity within the components of the provision (loans held for investment (“HFI”) and unfunded loan commitments) for each reported period is provided in the table on page 14. We discuss the various factors that impacted our provision expense for Loans HFI in further detail below under the heading Allowance for Credit Losses .

Noninterest Income and Noninterest Expense

Noninterest income for the fourth quarter of 2025 totaled $20.1 million compared to $22.3 million for the third quarter of 2025 and $18.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, the $2.2 million, or 10.0%, decrease was primarily attributable to a $0.8 million decrease in other income, a $0.6 million decrease in mortgage banking revenues and a $0.6 million decrease in wealth management fees. The decline in other income reflected the $0.7 million gain from the sale of our insurance subsidiary in the third quarter of 2025. The decline in mortgage banking revenues was due to a lower gain on sale margin. The decrease in wealth management fees was attributable to lower retail brokerage fees. The $1.3 million, or 7.2%, increase over the fourth quarter of 2024 was primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in mortgage banking revenues which reflected higher production volume and gain on sale margin.

For 2025, noninterest income totaled $82.4 million compared to $76.0 million for 2024, attributable to increases in mortgage banking revenues of $2.6 million, wealth management fees of $1.6 million, other income of $1.5 million, and deposit fees of $0.7 million. Higher production volume and gain on sale margin drove the improvement in mortgage banking revenues. The increase in wealth management fees was due to higher trust fees and reflected a combination of new business, higher account valuations, and fee adjustments. The increase in other income reflected the aforementioned $0.7 million gain from the sale of our insurance subsidiary in 2025. Fee adjustments implemented in mid-2025 contributed to the increase in deposit fees and other income.

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2025 totaled $42.9 million comparable to the third quarter of 2025 and $41.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2024. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, a $2.3 million increase in compensation expense was offset by a $2.4 million decrease in other expense. The increase in compensation was driven by higher performance-based pay and the decrease in other expense was primarily attributable to a $1.5 million pension settlement gain and to a lesser extent lower professional fees and processing fees. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, the $1.1 million increase was primarily attributable to a $2.3 million increase in compensation expense partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in other expense. The increase in compensation reflected higher performance-based pay and to a lesser extent higher health insurance cost. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to the aforementioned pension settlement gain of $1.5 million and a $0.8 million decrease in professional fees, partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in other real estate expense which reflected gains from the sale of banking facilities in the fourth quarter of 2024.

For 2025, noninterest expense totaled $167.0 million compared to $165.3 million for 2024 with the $1.7 million, or 1.0%, increase primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in compensation expense that was partially offset by a $4.7 million decrease in other expense. The increase in compensation was driven by higher performance-based pay and health insurance cost, and to a lesser extent an increase in 401k matching expense. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to a $3.4 million decrease in other real estate expense due to higher gains from the sale of banking facilities in 2025 and a $3.7 million decrease in pension expense (non-service component), partially offset by increases in processing expense of $1.2 million (outsource of core processing system) and charitable contribution expense of $0.9 million. The variance in pension expense included the aforementioned $1.5 million pension settlement gain that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Income Taxes

We realized income tax expense of $4.9 million (effective rate of 26.3%) for the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to $5.1 million (effective rate of 24.4%) for the third quarter of 2025 and $4.2 million (effective rate of 24.3%) for the fourth quarter of 2024. For 2025, we realized income tax expense of $20.2 million (effective rate of 24.7%) compared to $13.9 million (effective rate of 21.2%) for 2024. The increase in the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2025 was attributable to a higher than projected Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 162(m) limitation related to current and future compensation. A lower level of tax benefit accrued from a solar tax credit equity fund drove the increase in our effective tax rate compared to 2024. Absent discrete items or new tax credit investments, we expect our annual effective tax rate to approximate 24% for 2026.

Discussion of Financial Condition

Earning Assets

Average earning assets totaled $4.036 billion for the fourth quarter of 2025, an increase of $54.4 million, or 1.4%, over the third quarter of 2025, and an increase of $114.0 million, or 2.9%, over the fourth quarter of 2024. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, the change in the earning asset mix reflected an $81.4 million increase in overnight funds sold and a $12.2 million increase in investment securities, partially offset by a $38.1 million decrease in loans HFI and a $1.0 million decrease in loans held for sale (“HFS”). Compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, the change in earning asset mix reflected a $139.3 million increase in overnight funds sold and a $90.8 million increase in investment securities, partially offset by a $109.3 million decrease in loans HFI and a $6.8 million decrease in loans HFS.

Average loans HFI decreased by $38.1 million, or 1.5%, from the third quarter of 2025 and decreased by $109.3 million, or 4.1%, from the fourth quarter of 2024. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, the decline was primarily attributable to decreases in commercial real estate loans of $15.9 million, residential real estate loans of $12.9 million, and consumer loans (primarily indirect auto) of $8.8 million. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, the decline was driven by decreases in construction loans of $61.2 million, consumer loans (primarily auto indirect loans) of $23.3 million, and commercial real estate loans of $22.7 million.

Loans HFI at December 31, 2025, decreased by $35.9 million, or 1.4%, from September 30, 2025, and decreased by $105.4 million, or 4.0%, from December 31, 2024. Compared to September 30, 2025, the decline was primarily due to decreases in commercial real estate loans of $16.6 million, residential real estate loans of $16.4 million, and construction loans of $9.8 million. Compared to December 31, 2024, the decline was driven by decreases in construction loans of $73.1 million, consumer loans (primarily indirect auto) of $17.2 million, and commercial real estate loans of $10.4 million.

Allowance for Credit Losses

At December 31, 2025, the allowance for credit losses for loans HFI totaled $31.0 million compared to $30.2 million at September 30, 2025 and $29.3 million at December 31, 2024. Activity within the allowance is provided on Page 14. The increase in the allowance over both prior periods was primarily attributable to qualitative factor adjustments that were partially offset by lower loan balances. Net loan charge-offs were 18 basis points of average loans for the fourth quarter of 2025 comparable to the third quarter of 2025 and 25 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2024. For 2025, net loan charge-offs were 14 basis points compared to 21 basis points for 2024. At December 31, 2025, the allowance represented 1.22% of loans HFI compared to 1.17% at September 30, 2025, and 1.10% at December 31, 2024.

Credit Quality

Nonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and other real estate) totaled $10.6 million at December 31, 2025, compared to $10.0 million at September 30, 2025, and $6.7 million at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2025, nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets was 0.24%, compared to 0.23% at September 30, 2025 and 0.15% at December 31, 2024. Nonaccrual loans totaled $8.7 million at December 31, 2025, a $0.5 million increase over September 30, 2025 and a $2.4 million increase over December 31, 2024. Classified loans totaled $14.3 million at December 31, 2025, a $12.2 million decrease from September 30, 2025, and a $5.6 million decrease from December 31, 2024.

Deposits

Average total deposits were $3.648 billion for the fourth quarter of 2025, an increase of $35.2 million, or 1.0%, over the third quarter of 2025 and an increase of $47.1 million, or 1.3%, over the fourth quarter of 2024. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, the increase was primarily attributable to higher public funds balances (primarily NOW accounts) due to the seasonal inflow of funds from municipal clients as they receive their tax receipts beginning in late November. The increase over the fourth quarter of 2024 was primarily due to growth in core deposit balances (primarily business NOW accounts).

At December 31, 2025, total deposits were $3.662 billion, an increase of $47.4 million, or 1.3%, over September 30 2025, and a decrease of $9.7 million, or 0.3%, from December 31, 2024. The decrease compared to September 30, 2025 reflected the aforementioned seasonal inflow of public funds partially offset by lower core deposit balances, primarily noninterest bearing and NOW business accounts. Public funds totaled $654.7 million at December 31, 2025, $497.9 million at September 30, 2025, and $660.9 million at December 31, 2024.

Liquidity

We maintained an average net overnight funds (i.e., deposits with banks plus FED funds sold less FED funds purchased) sold position of $437.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared to $356.2 million in the third quarter of 2025 and $298.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Compared to the third quarter of 2025, the increase reflected growth in average public fund deposit balances and lower average loan balances. The increase over the fourth quarter of 2024 was primarily due to higher average core deposit balances and lower average loan balances, partially offset by higher average investment security balances.

At December 31, 2025, we had the ability to generate approximately $1.523 billion (excludes overnight funds position of $467.8 million) in additional liquidity through various sources including various federal funds purchased lines, Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, the Federal Reserve Discount Window, and brokered deposits.

We also view our investment portfolio as a liquidity source, as we have the option to pledge securities in our portfolio as collateral for borrowings or deposits and/or to sell selected securities in our portfolio. Our portfolio consists of debt issued by the U.S. Treasury, U.S. governmental agencies, municipal governments, and corporate entities. At December 31, 2025, the weighted-average maturity and duration of our portfolio were 2.57 years and 2.12 years, respectively, and the available-for-sale portfolio had a net unrealized after-tax loss of $9.4 million.

Capital

Shareowners’ equity was $552.9 million at December 31, 2025, compared to $540.6 million at September 30, 2025, and $495.3 million at December 31, 2024. For the full year 2025, shareowners’ equity was positively impacted by net income attributable to shareowners of $61.6 million, a net $9.1 million decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive loss, the issuance of common stock of $3.5 million, and stock compensation accretion of $2.4 million. The net favorable change in accumulated other comprehensive loss reflected a $10.7 million decrease in the investment securities loss that was partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in the fair value of the interest rate swap related to subordinated debt and a $0.3 million decrease in the pension plan loss from the year-end re-measurement of the plan. Shareowners’ equity was reduced by common stock dividends of $17.1 million ($1.00 per share) and net adjustments totaling $1.9 million related to transactions under our stock compensation plans.

At December 31, 2025, our total risk-based capital ratio was 21.45% compared to 20.59% at September 30, 2025, and 18.64% at December 31, 2024. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 18.54%, 17.73%, and 15.54%, respectively, on these dates. Our leverage ratio was 11.77%, 11.64%, and 11.05%, respectively, on these dates. At December 31, 2025, all our regulatory capital ratios exceeded the thresholds to be designated as “well-capitalized” under the Basel III capital standards. Further, our tangible common equity ratio (non-GAAP financial measure) was 10.79% at December 31, 2025, compared to 10.66% and 9.51% at September 30, 2025, and December 31, 2024, respectively.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Unaudited

We present a tangible common equity ratio and a tangible book value per diluted share that removes the effect of goodwill and other intangibles resulting from merger and acquisition activity. We believe these measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to more easily compare our capital adequacy to other companies in the industry. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives to GAAP-basis financial statements and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these non-GAAP measures or similar measures differently.

ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill., Jan. 27, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The largest live entertainment venue in the United States is making history as the first major arena to offer THC beverages. Chicago’s iconic United Center has entered a new multi-year partnership with Chicago-based brands Señorita and RYTHM to make THC beverages available at concerts and live events, expanding consumer options for attendees 21 and over.

United Center guests can now enjoy Señorita and RYTHM hemp-derived THC drinks at the majority of concerts, shows, and special events throughout the year with multiple points of sale throughout the venue, including grab-and-go stations, bars, and a dedicated Señorita mobile branded bar. The partnership with RYTHM, Inc., the parent company behind Señorita and RYTHM, marks a new chapter in modern drinking, launching alongside one of the venue’s most star-studded entertainment seasons, featuring global tours, major comedy acts, and Chicago’s most anticipated cultural moments.

“This partnership is a major milestone for the city of Chicago, and we are proud to partner with the United Center to offer Illinois’ leading THC beverages,” said Ben Kovler, RYTHM, Inc. Chairman and Interim CEO. “Bringing Señorita and RYTHM to the United Center reflects a simple truth: consumers want non-alcoholic options, and leading venues are responding. The United Center is one of the world’s premier venues and continues to set the standard for live entertainment with the introduction of these modern, responsible options.”

Señorita and RYTHM will officially kick off this historic partnership at the beginning of February with special giveaways and non-infused samples at two shows: The New Edition Way Tour with New Edition, Boyz II Men, and Toni Braxton on February 4, and the Life Is a Highway Tour with Rascal Flatts, Lauren Alaina, and Chris Lane on February 6. The partnership will continue to take the main stage throughout the year with branded elements in the venue, in addition to ongoing product sampling and branded giveaways at select events.

""We are excited to introduce Señorita and RYTHM to the live entertainment space,” said Joe Myhra, Chief Operating Officer, United Center. “As we continue to evolve offerings for our guests, RYTHM’s Chicago roots made its beverage line a natural fit for the United Center experience.”

The initial lineup will include four 5 mg hemp-derived THC options. Señorita will be available in three flavor-driven classics: Lime Jalapeño Margarita, Mango Margarita, and Grapefruit Paloma, designed for bright, refreshing taste and a smooth, social lift. RYTHM offerings will include its uplifting Sativa beverage, pairing mandarin orange with natural caffeine for a crisp, energizing boost that is perfect for live events.

This partnership marks a cultural moment, reflecting the growing demand for alternative drinking options. It also follows major distribution momentum for both THC beverages across Chicago, including placement at retailers such as Binny’s Beverage Depot, Woodman’s Food Markets, and Foxtrot Market. Now, with Señorita and RYTHM available at the United Center, guests can opt into an alcohol-free alternative, designed for connection, flavor, and a vibrant new way to experience live events.

FORT WORTH, Texas, Jan. 27, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ: AAL) today reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 financial results, including:

Record fourth-quarter revenue of $14.0 billion and record full-year revenue of $54.6 billion

The government shutdown negatively impacted revenue in the fourth quarter by approximately $325 million

Fourth-quarter and full-year GAAP net income of $99 million and $111 million, or $0.15 and $0.17 per diluted share, respectively

Excluding net special items 1 , fourth-quarter and full-year net income of $106 million and $237 million, or $0.16 and $0.36 per diluted share, respectively

Reduced total debt 2 by $2.1 billion in 2025

Full-year 2026 adjusted EPS 3 expected to be between $1.70 and $2.70

Company expects free cash flow 4 of more than $2 billion in 2026

“American Airlines is positioned for significant upside in 2026 and beyond,” said American’s CEO Robert Isom. “We have built a strong foundation, and we look forward to taking advantage of the investments we have made in our customer experience, network, fleet, partnerships and loyalty program. The strategy we have in place will put American in the right position as we celebrate our centennial and embark on our next 100 years as a premium global airline.""

Delivering on revenue potential

American delivered record fourth-quarter revenue of $14.0 billion, despite the $325 million negative impact from the government shutdown. Year-over-year passenger unit revenue performance improved sequentially versus the third quarter in each of the international entities.

That executive added that Bank of America did not think Nvidia's AI enterprise software was ""ready for their highly regulated banking industry.""
The struggles at Bank of America echo earlier issues with Nvidia's enterprise software efforts, including a need to educate prospective clients on what it is and isn't.","Nvidia ran into some resistance as one of the world's biggest banks struggled to adopt its AI enterprise software, signaling how hard it can be for massive, highly regulated companies to put cutting-edge technology to use.

Nvidia sales executives recapped conversations with key customers — including Bank of America — following a conference late last year, according to an internal email thread from November viewed by Business Insider.

The chip giant has been selling its ""AI Factory"" — a full setup of chips and software designed to build, train, and run large-scale AI systems — to large businesses.

Bank of America told Nvidia it was struggling with deployment, according to the email thread. The exchange reveals that while companies rush to purchase AI infrastructure, operational and regulatory hurdles make deploying it far harder — a key challenge for Nvidia as it expands from selling chips into enterprise software. On the thread, Nvidia executives also discussed how they can better work with customers in using its AI products.

""You sold us a Formula 1 race car,"" an Nvidia executive reported the bank said, comparing the AI Factory to the race car, ""and now you have to help us as local car mechanics drive the race car!""

Bank of America declined to comment. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

A second executive later responded that Nvidia ""can't just sell"" AI Factory hardware but needs to provide a software solution to help business customers succeed.

The gap between buying infrastructure and actually deploying AI is common across industries, said Rumman Chowdhury, who advises companies on responsible AI.

""Buying GPUs or signing a cloud contract is a business decision; deploying AI is an institutional change,"" she told Business Insider. ""It's much easier to approve a budget line item than to re‑architect workflows, retrain teams, and rewrite governance processes.""

Lacking 'MLOps skills'

Recapping its meeting with Bank of America, the first Nvidia executive said the bank lacked ""the MLOps skills in house."" MLOps refers to machine learning operations, or the processes for implementing AI models in real-world use cases.

That executive added that Bank of America did not think Nvidia's AI enterprise software was ""ready for their highly regulated banking industry.""

The executive also pointed to other concerns, including Bank of America's security and governance requirements, such as documentation and support for air gapping — isolating systems from other networks to improve security. They noted the challenges the bank faced in supporting multiple AI models and software systems to meet different needs.

Nvidia vice president Ian Buck subsequently jumped into the thread, signalling how senior leaders at the chip giant can step in when customer concerns surface.

""Looks like they need help and/or our product is coming up short,"" Buck wrote.

The struggles at Bank of America echo earlier issues with Nvidia's enterprise software efforts, including a need to educate prospective clients on what it is and isn't.

AI deployment obstacles aren't exclusive to banking; they are prevalent across sectors. While banks have a long history of using AI for tasks like credit decisioning, they may be the first to run into issues because of the scale of their data and customers, said Tom Davenport, an information technology and management professor at Babson College.

""The technology's out way ahead of what individual banks or most companies actually can implement quickly,"" he said.",https://i.insider.com/6977dccba645d118818802fb?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2026-01-27 09:00:26.134907

The chipmaker, already an investor in CoreWeave, said it had bought the company’s Class A shares at $87.20 per share. As part of the deal, CoreWeave and Nvidia plan to together build “AI factories” (data centers) that would use the chipmaker’s products.

CoreWeave will also integrate Nvidia’s products across its platform, including the new Rubin chip architecture (set to replace the current Blackwell architecture), Bluefield storage systems, as well as the chipmaker’s new CPU line, Vera.

The deal is a strong show of support for CoreWeave, which has come under scrutiny over the past few months for raising billions in debt to continue building out its data center operations. The company had $18.81 billion in debt obligations as of September 2025, according to PitchBook data, and it reported revenue of $1.36 billion in the third quarter.

The company’s CEO Michael Intrator has defended its business model (funding operations by raising debt with its GPUs as collateral), and has addressed concerns of circular deals in the AI industry by saying companies have to “work together” to address a “violent change in supply and demand.”

The company has managed to successfully ride the AI wave since its transition from a crypto mining company to a provider of data center services for AI training and inference. And since its IPO in March last year, it has been busy fleshing out its technology stack with a slew of acquisitions. It acquired Weights & Biases, an AI developer platform, in March, and then soon after bought reinforcement learning startup OpenPipe. In October, it agreed to acquire Marimo (an open source Jupyter notebook competitor) and Monolith, another AI company. It also recently expanded its cloud partnership with OpenAI.

The company currently counts several hyperscalers as customers, including OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft.

As part of the deal, Nvidia will also help CoreWeave buy land and power for data centers, and work with the smaller company to include its AI software and architecture within Nvidia’s reference architecture to sell to cloud businesses and enterprises.

CoreWeave’s shares were up more than 15% following news of the deal.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1468360413.jpg?resize=1200,857",N,,2026-01-27 13:12:21.258224

MICHELIN have launched a new tyre designed specifically to deliver the high-performance required by the latest generation of powerful mine and quarry wheel loaders. The Michelin Xtra Power L5** 26.5 R25 combines robustness and productivity in extreme and demanding conditions, while optimizing operator comfort. Following the initial version of the Michelin Xtra Power L5*** 35/65 R33 in 2021, this new size complements Michelin’s tyre offerings for loaders.

Clifford de Jager, CES technical manager, beyond road - mining, construction, material handling at Michelin, said: ‘At Michelin, we are always adapting and developing our products to ensure they match the needs of the latest machinery on the market. The Michelin Xtra Power L5** 26.5 R25 can handle the most challenging working environments, while delivering optimized load capacity and improved torque transmission in a stable, comfortable and safe manner.’

Acknowledging the new generation of larger vehicles with high-capacity buckets, the Michelin Xtra Power L5** 26.5 R25 allows for a load capacity increase of up to 18.5 tonnes, 23% more than the previous generation.

Michelin engineers have developed an innovative structure for this new tyre size. It features a curved design and improved support of the rubber blocks that reduce stress on the contact surface and maximizes protection. The tread and shoulders of the tyre have been reinforced for added protection against damage. Torque transmission is improved by the larger bead heel.

Thanks to its new tread design and unique rubber compound, the Michelin Xtra Power L5** 26.5 R25 possesses improved robustness, withstanding abrasive soils and aggressive surfaces, and facilitating movement on varied terrains such as stones, debris, and rock, thereby enhancing machine productivity. These innovations also contribute to reducing the risk of rim slip due to the larger bead heel preventing premature wear.

Designed to be retreadable, the Michelin Xtra Power L5** 26.5 R25 allows fleet managers to optimize its use, as well as operational costs, in the long term. The comfort and safety of users is a priority for Michelin in the design of their products. This new size can be used up to 7.5 bars, improving the stability of machines by 20% and further enhancing operator comfort, even during intensive loading cycles.

The focus on a higher-quality design has led to strengthening of the product through the addition of metal in the crown and protective layers, resulting in a more robust tyre that is highly resistant to damage.",https://www.agg-net.com/sites/default/files/styles/facebook/public/2026-01/michelin.jpg?h=bc3815d4&itok=MPye36DD,N,,2026-01-27 13:12:16.373970

“We expect a more supportive backdrop for U.S. travel in 2026,” said Aran Ryan, director of industry studies with Tourism Economics.","LOS ANGELES—CoStar and Tourism Economics made minimal adjustments to growth projections in the first 2026-27 U.S. hotel forecast just released at the Americas Lodging Investment Summit today here.

For 2026, occupancy, average daily rate and revenue per available room were each upgraded 0.1 ppts from the previous forecast. Supply growth was lowered 0.2 ppts, while demand was reduced 0.1 ppts.

Isaac Collazo, vice president of analytics at STR, shared the projections on stage at ALIS with some reservations. ""We still believe it's going to be a better year than 2025 but not a stellar year,"" he said. ""Even with the World Cup, you take out the 10 top 25 cities that are hosting the World Cup event, those are really going to be the drivers of the [growth] this year.""

“We expect top-line performance to strengthen in the second half of the year, although growth will remain moderate and concentrated among higher-tier hotels,” said Amanda Hite, STR president. “The early months of that period will be highlighted by notable gains in World Cup host markets and their surrounding areas. In addition, calendar shifts will provide a lift, especially as we move past the elevated comparables from the 2024 hurricane-affected markets.”

Growth rates are projected to rise further in 2027, but even the forecasted 1.4 percent increase in RevPAR would remain below the long-term average (+3 percent).

“We expect a more supportive backdrop for U.S. travel in 2026,” said Aran Ryan, director of industry studies with Tourism Economics. “While a softer job market weighs on younger and lower-wage households, real wage gains and household wealth should keep consumer spending resilient. Business investment will broaden beyond AI as borrowing costs ease and tax incentives support new projects. International travel faces near-term headwinds but will likely see a gradual rebound as global demand strengthens and the World Cup boosts summer arrivals.”

“Total revenues are expected to rise at a faster pace than last year, while expenses should follow a similar trajectory—though at a slower rate of growth than in 2025,” said Hite. “Even so, expense growth will continue to outpace inflation.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud1/media/image/6f94eb2e-387e-4b1c-bf66-662dc6547f4a.jpeg?VersionId=2LKAwl2uxkx5xJz3o5nqzaLinLgKUuaa,N,,2026-01-27 14:03:07.280200

The deal is still ongoing, and KDP has recently made an offer on all common JDE Peet’s stock as part of the takeover. Ahead of that, Peet’s has announced the sudden closure of multiple cafe locations around the San Francisco area.

As reported by SF Gate, the Berkeley-born coffee shop and roaster is scheduled to close an unknown number of cafes across the Bay Area by the end of January. Some reporting has the number of shops at two dozen while others state as high as 30. No information about which locations are scheduled to close was given. According to the Peet’s website, there are over 100 locations in the greater San Francisco area.

According to a spokesperson for the brand, the closures “reflect a broader effort to align our business with long-term growth priorities and current market conditions.” It correlates with moves being made by other corporate-owned entities in the coffee space, in particular, the move away from brick and mortar. In December, Nestle began exploring the sale of Blue Bottle as a means of divesting from retail (with Luckin Coffee of all companies being linked to the purchase). Coca-Cola meanwhile tried unsuccessfully to sell Costa Coffee.

The question remains if and/or how the downsizing will affect other specialty coffee institutions. JDE Peet’s owns Stumptown and Intelligentsia, though both brands act independently and operate within the higher end specialty coffee market. But if new owners KDP decide to continue moving away from retail, could that also trickle down to these two brands, Stumptown in particular given their larger presence outside of brick-and-mortar cafes, including retail cold brew and wholesale.",https://sprudge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/peets_creams.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:11:09.531893

take their potential shopping data and use it for ad targeting all over the internet, as many retailers are trying now?","Since the pandemic, e-commerce has been surging, and retail media has exploded - as people’s shopping habits have seemed to undergo a permanent shift.

Just a few years later, is the entire retail category, along with its RM cousin, about to be completely upended again?

Just in the past few weeks:

OpenAI announced plans to finally start introducing ads into ChatGPT

Google announced a partnership to incorporate Walmart into ChatGPT competitor, Google Gemini

These two moves come on the heels of Amazon, Walmart and others incorporating some version of AI-powered chat into their shopping experiences, along with lots of noise about agents shopping for us.

To be sure, this is still all very theoretical. Will ChatGPT ads work as well as search ads? What role will RM ads play, or not play? How will Google make Walmart, and every other potential shopping partners happy?

What do consumers actually want? I personally have major doubts about agentic shopping. I’m less certain that ads will be completely welcome in chat interfaces, where people are seeking ‘answers,’ not lists of choices (like in search). It’s not a layup that OpenAI will just turn on ads and be the next Facebook or Google.

I’m also not sure how Gemini and others will incorporate retailers, while maintaining perceived objectivity. How many Walmart-like deals can a Gemini have before it becomes a mess, for example.

To help break it all down, I chatted with Kiri Masters, host of Retail Media Breakfast Club, on the Next in Media podcast this week.

Masters founded and sold the eCommerce specialty agency Bobsled Marketing, has become a leading voice in the sector. She managed to challenge several of my assumptions, while providing an unvarnished take on where things might be headed.

On how AI Chat ads might actually work, and how they’d be different than standard internet fare:

“It all depends what these ads actually look like, right? As to whether people will engage with [these ads], if they will still feel like their AI assistant is a trusted collaborator rather than some sleazy salesperson trying to pitch things to them. I am personally am very optimistic.”

As Masters noted, for certain power users, their chat interface of choice might ‘know’ them better than even some of the highly intelligent social platforms. So the ad promise could represent a combination of strong intent (search) and a deep knowledge of what a person likes (social).

“All of the contacts that these LLMs have [with consumers], we’re sharing not just our requests for recipe ideas, but we’re sharing our hopes, dreams, fears, marital counseling questions. So I think that ads in LLMs have the potential to actually be really cool. And the big question is if they sort of take that direction and run with it, vesus just trying to sort of copy what has been done on other platforms.”

Ok, so what about shopping, and shopping-related advertising? Could that serious dent retail media’s footprint, as I’ve been wondering recently?

“This is the question, if AI-enabled commerce becomes one of these surfaces that people are using for transactions or very close to transaction behavior - I like to say brands are fair weather friends. They will just take whatever budget they have that’s not working as well somewhere else and they’ll move it right over. There is absolutely no loyalty that they have.”

That of course, assumes that AI shopping works well, and actually makes like easier for consumers. Which is TBD right now.

“I was just trying to do my grocery shopping last night on ChatGPT with Instacart. It was okay. It was an okay experience. There wasn’t anything really about it that was better than going to Instacart’s app. If anything, it was a little bit more tedious.”

What about deals like the Walmart one? How do Google or OpenAI balance making partners happy, and servicing consumers? Could these companies actually be making a play to take on Amazon in eCommerce?

“[When you talk to retailers], a line that they are not prepared to cross is, giving up being the merchant of record with. So they’re interested in [AI chat] being a new surface that shoppers use to engage with their assortment or even have an agent handle part of that transaction. There’s lots of different iterations, but what, they all, all said about the limitations is they want to be the merchant of record. They want to handle the returns, handle the customer service, handle the warranties, etc.”

Otherwise, what is the, what is the value being a retailer? Plus, as Masters pointed out to me, what makes Amazon Amazon isn’t just being the default shopping vehicle online, it’s the company’s ability to deliver - literally and figuratively. Do these AI giants really want to get into warehousing, logistics, etc.?

Getting back to ads, here’s an interesting Masters prediction/speculative idea. Could OpenAI, Gemini, etc. take their potential shopping data and use it for ad targeting all over the internet, as many retailers are trying now?

“I see that as being, as creating a big risk for retailers’ off-site media networks, because now another party has that transaction data and they have that intent data and the pre-purchase activity data.” That said, OpenAI has said it would never ‘sell’ people’s data. The company also said it had no interest in ads.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!H7Vg!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b3f8827-2995-4f67-8002-0b906efc8a60_1024x1024.png",N,,2026-01-27 13:12:25.392465

He was focused on getting on with his new and bigger job while repeating the mantra that ""change is hard"" and talking about growth stories at Davos. Yesterday, however, a new Sieg-related lawsuit was filed, and it seems more peculiar than the complaints preceding it.

The Financial Times reported that Julia Carreon, who was Citi Wealth’s global head of platform and experience until 2024, has filed a lawsuit in which she says Citi wrongly claimed that she had an inappropriate relationship with Sieg while she worked there.

Citi says Carreon's lawsuit has ""absolutely no merit"" and that it will be demonstrating this ""through legal process.""

Whereas earlier complaints about Sieg - which Citi insists it thoroughly investigated - focused on his alleged hard-charging approach, Carreon's suit portrays an isolated individual at the top of one of Citi's most challenging businesses who, she claims, called and texted her multiple times a week - sometimes from a burner phone - because he had no one to talk to.

Carreon says she wasn't having a relationship with Sieg, but claims that Sieg insinuated that they were. She says Sieg's insinuations included claiming that they shared a ""secret song."" The song is not divulged.

When Carreon and Sieg's alleged closeness was discerned by Citi and by colleagues, who the Wall Street Journal says assumed that she was having an affair with Sieg, Carreon says the bank conducted an investigation. She says this was biased against her and that the HR team sided with Sieg. In her complaint filed yesterday, she accuses the bank of having a “discriminatory and sexually harassing culture.” Citi denies this.

As Business Insider observed this week, Sieg is one of Citi CEO Jane Fraser's prize hires. Fraser said in September that the bank ""looked at the matter seriously"" when earlier complaints were made about him, and concluded that they were invalid. Sieg was tasked with cutting costs and restructuring the wealth business, where revenues have increased 22% in the past two years. Fraser said last September that Sieg had ""delivered"" on his mandate and that she was very pleased with both he and his team.

Separately, Sina Lashgari and Jon Paul seemed to be having a fine time at Goldman Sachs, where their 20-person program trading team made $700m a year for two years to 2022 and an unnamed individual received a $9m bonus.

Like many talented traders, the two decided to move to a hedge fund. Unfortunately, the move seems to have been fraught from the start. First, Goldman accused them of, ""accessing sensitive Firm proprietary computer software...without authorization or a valid business purpose, and attempting to remove or hide evidence."" Now, Bloomberg reports that Verition has closed their team three years after they joined.

The reason for the closure is unclear, but Bloomberg suggests it was down to the poor performance of some event-driven bets. Lashgari didn't respond to a request to comment.

Some Verition insiders have described the fund as being run by ""really nice people"" and having a fine culture. Others have told us that the London office is very nice and has good snacks. However, like all hedge funds, Verition has a limited tolerance for drawdowns. It is also not unfamiliar with hiring good people and letting them go again - Sara Nainzadeh, who spent 20 years at Milllennium, came and went within a year or so.

Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is included among the 12 Most Profitable Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2026.

On January 23, Guggenheim analyst Vamil Divan raised his price target on Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to $240 from $227. The firm reiterated a Buy rating. The move followed what he described as “solid” fourth-quarter results, along with initial 2026 guidance that came in slightly ahead of sell-side expectations.

After the quarter, Divan said he made several tweaks to his model. Those included lifting near-term forecasts for Tremfya, factoring in faster erosion for Stelara, and raising estimates for a number of newer products. Even with those adjustments, Johnson & Johnson remains a Top Pick in the large-cap biopharma space in his view.

The company reported its fourth-quarter 2025 earnings on January 21 and paired the release with a 2026 outlook that landed above Wall Street’s expectations. What stood out was that the guidance held up despite a few meaningful headwinds. Among them are a recent drug pricing agreement with the Trump administration and roughly $500 million in tariff-related costs tied to the medical devices business.

Johnson & Johnson said the pricing deal reached earlier this month, which is intended to lower costs for certain prescription drugs, could end up costing the company “hundreds of millions of dollars.”

Even with that pressure baked in, management is forecasting 2026 sales between $99.5 billion and $100.5 billion. That compares with analyst expectations of about $98.9 billion, according to LSEG. On earnings, the company expects full-year profit of $11.43 to $11.63 per share, slightly ahead of the Street’s $11.45 estimate.

Firefly Foundry can support the creation of new content that brings stories to life in these spaces across digital displays, mobile apps and more.
Driving efficiencies in post-production: Firefly Foundry helps editors and visual effects artists pick up shots, correct scenes and polish final frames without costly reshoots.
Among our partners are: Talent agencies, including Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency and William Morris Endeavor.","We live in a moment when stories move faster than ever. Audiences discover movies, TV shows, short‑form videos, long‑form content and social media across more platforms than ever, and increasingly expect each interaction to be fresh, relevant, and resonant. For creators, that demand is both exhilarating and unrelenting. Media and entertainment leaders, talent, directors and visionary storytellers are being asked to deliver more, at increasing speed, while honoring the craft, nuance and authenticity that defines great creative work.

For decades, Adobe has stood at the heart of filmmaking. Our technology has earned multiple Academy Awards for scientific and technical achievement, and acclaimed films across genres have been cut, shaped, and finished in our tools. This year, 85 percent of films premiering at the Sundance Film Festival were created using Adobe tools, underscoring the trust the industry and creative community places in our technology.

Putting the artist at the center has always been core to our company ethos and is why we intentionally chose to create commercially safe, ethically trained AI models. So, when the industry began grappling with tough questions about AI’s role in storytelling, such as “How do we keep creativity at the center?” “How do we protect the creative universes artists build?” “How do we scale responsibly without compromising on quality?” — they turned to Adobe for help.

Filmmakers turn to Adobe Firefly Foundry

Adobe Firefly Foundry is our answer. With Firefly Foundry, Firefly’s commercially safe AI models are deeply tuned with a company or IP owner’s unique, proprietary brand or franchise content. Those omni-models can generate high-fidelity images, video, audio, 3D and vector outputs with a complete understanding of a brand or franchise’s creative universe.Sean Bailey, founder and CEO of B5 Studios, said his company is partnering with Adobe in part because of its history in the creative community. “Adobe has always valued the creative process, championing artists and the worlds they bring to life,” Bailey said. “At B5 Studios, we share that commitment as a next-generation content and technology company, collaborating with creators to develop premium storytelling across film, television, and emerging formats. We’re thrilled to bring our creative and technical expertise to Firefly Foundry, advancing innovation that empowers artists and honors Adobe’s vision.”

Firefly Foundry helps the media and entertainment industry move faster while preserving artistry, authorship and ownership. Today, we’re sharing meaningful ways for enterprises, studios, creatives, talent and directors to unlock new possibilities throughout the filmmaking process — from pre- to post-production and everything in between:

Storytelling at the speed of culture: Studios can increase mindshare through scaling fresh, short-form social content. With Firefly Foundry, companies can bring stories to life for broader audiences (additional characters, story arcs and more) while ensuring creative control over how their IP is presented.

Expanding worlds beyond the screen: Brands continue to invest in immersive in-person experiences, from amusement parks to pop-up venues. Firefly Foundry can support the creation of new content that brings stories to life in these spaces across digital displays, mobile apps and more.

Transforming ideation and “fixing in Pre”: Firefly Foundry provides directors and storyboard artists with more robust tools to bring their ideas to life in the ideation stage and more accurately portray their original vision.

Empowering on-set creativity: Directors and their teams on set can ensure they are getting the right creative options for their shot list as filming progresses on set, while also ingesting and processing their dailies with more efficiency.

Driving efficiencies in post-production: Firefly Foundry helps editors and visual effects artists pick up shots, correct scenes and polish final frames without costly reshoots.

“Adobe has been part of the creative process for generations of filmmakers. Integrating Firefly Foundry into our workflow builds on that legacy by giving our artists the freedom to push ideas further, while giving co-production, client, and distribution partners confidence in how generative AI is being used.” – Jamie Byrne, co-founder, president and COO of Promise Advanced Imagination.

Putting studios in control with secure, brand‑specific AI

AI is already helping many enterprises, studios, creatives, talent and directors meet this challenge, but those leading the industry are clear that innovation must never come at the expense of the creative spirit; it must strengthen it while protecting originality and the brilliant human ingenuity behind the work.

Across entertainment, industry leaders are choosing Adobe because they want AI that elevates creators — not replaces them. They want a partner with technology that will help usher in a new era of responsible, AI-enabled storytelling.

For example, Bryan Lourd, CEO and co-chairman of Creative Artists Agency notes: “Adobe is a world-class technology company that recognizes the importance of protecting creators’ rights and intellectual property and is committed to building a responsible AI ecosystem. Firefly Foundry empowers artists with commercially safe tools that expand the possibilities of creative expression, and we look forward to bringing these capabilities to our clients.”

Adobe is collaborating with industry leaders who are eager to be on the forefront of this pivotal moment. Among our partners are:

Talent agencies, including Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency and William Morris Endeavor.

Hybrid and AI-native film studios, including B5 Studios and Promise Advanced Imagination.

Design and VFX studios, including Cantina Creative.

Visionary directors including David Ayer (“Fast and Furious”, “Suicide Squad”) and Jaume Collet-Serra (“Black Adam”, “Jungle Cruise”).

“Logic Film Group was born from a shared belief that the creative filmmaking process can excel by embracing innovative tools and approaches,” said Jaume Collet-Serra, co-founder of Logic Film Group and director of films “Black Adam” and “Jungle Cruise”. “Leveraging Firefly Foundry’s responsible AI models can support us in finding new, efficient ways to operate throughout production — freeing our mindshare to focus on artistry.”

We’re also partnering with Wonder Studios, Parsons School of Design and Whistling Woods Film School to develop research, educational resources and curriculum focused on the role of AI in creative fields, supporting the next generation of creators, artists and filmmakers.

“Parsons is proud to partner with Adobe on this exciting educational initiative that will help determine and shape the future of AI technologies and how they are utilized by creatives,” said Parsons Executive Dean Anne Gaines. “As a leader in design and technology, Adobe’s mission and vision are deeply aligned with Parsons, and we look forward to seeing what our talented students develop with these new tools.”

And it doesn’t just stop at entertainment. Adobe is transforming every industry, helping teams move from AI experimentation to value realization. In fact, 99 percent of Fortune 100 companies have used AI in an Adobe app. Brands including The Home Depot, HUMAIN and Walt Disney Imagineering are already working with Firefly Foundry to drive complex media production across creative and marketing use cases.

“Our mission is to protect the soul of the work as tools evolve,” said Justin Hackney, CCO and co-founder of Wonder Studios. “Partnering with Adobe removes the friction between imagination and execution, allowing creators to enter true flow states. This unlocks new visual languages and stronger emotional bridges, driving what has the potential to become the most transformative era in creative history.”

Across the industry, the consensus is clear: AI will shape the future of storytelling, but the real differentiator will be how responsibly it’s used to elevate the creative process. Adobe is committed to ensuring the future is shaped by and for creators.",https://cxotoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Adobe-Firefly-Foundry.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 04:59:18.137510

We welcome continued collaboration among organizations that rely on open source to help ensure its responsible and sustainable growth.” About Open Invention Network Open Invention Network (OIN) is the only institution focused on mitigating patent risk in open source software (OSS).","DURHAM, N.C., Jan. 27, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Since its founding in 2005, Open Invention Network (OIN) has been the only organization focused on mitigating patent risk in open source software (OSS). Its efforts have shielded the open source community from patent aggression, enabling open source to flourish. Today, OIN announces the launch of OIN 2.0 — a significant evolution of its model. Expanding support from a small, core group of funding members, OIN 2.0 introduces a shared and community-driven funding model designed to ensure the long-term sustainability of its mission. OIN 2.0 continues to provide free participation to small businesses and individuals, while medium-sized companies and large enterprises will support OIN’s future growth through a tiered annual participation fee based on revenue.

With investments from funding members IBM, Google, NEC, Philips, Red Hat, Sony, SUSE, and Toyota, OIN has built the largest active patent cross license in history, with more than 4,000 members that collectively hold more than three million patents and generate over $10 trillion in annual revenue. OIN 2.0 expands upon this legacy of clearing patent risk in open source at scale by offering community members continuously updated patent protection, while enabling it to address a broader spectrum of technologies and strengthening its model for the future.

“OIN 2.0 is a continuation of OIN’s long standing commitment to protect OSS from patent threats, modified to reflect today’s realities. Open source technologies have grown exponentially beyond Linux, into new and exciting sectors, and clearly beyond what was originally envisioned in the early 2000s when OIN was created. OIN 2.0 marks a transition and provides an opportunity for all who benefit from open source to contribute to OIN’s ongoing patent protection,” said Keith Bergelt, CEO of Open Invention Network. “OIN 2.0 fees will provide for OIN to update the scope of its patent protection coverage as OSS expands in the future, grow OIN’s network of participants to increase the breadth of its community, monitor patent threats to OSS, and support community members under patent threat in OSS with defensive strategies. The participation fee is structured so that large enterprises contribute more, medium-sized companies pay less, and small organizations remain free.” A full OIN 2.0 participation fee table is available on the OIN website at https://openinventionnetwork.com/join-oin-2-0/.

Linux System Table 13

In parallel with the launch of OIN 2.0 today, OIN has released Linux System Table 13, the first update to OIN’s patent protection coverage offered under the OIN 2.0 program. It covers over 650 new open source software packages, including smart technologies, security, networking, data centers, and automotive. It increases coverage for cloud computing, including for Kubernetes and Eclipse, and expands coverage for modern languages by adding many new libraries for Go, Python, and Rust. A full listing of Table 13 is available at https://openinventionnetwork.com/linux-system/.

OIN & OIN 2.0 Participation

Current OIN community members will continue to receive, free of charge, the protection provided by the first twelve Tables of software packages covered by the Linux System definition. To gain the expanded protection of Linux System Table 13 and future table expansions, current members must opt into OIN 2.0 by signing the OIN 2.0 license agreement. New organizations joining OIN will do so under the OIN 2.0 license agreement and gain access to both the historical coverage and new OIN 2.0 protections.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) has recently drawn investor attention after a period of mixed share performance, with the stock showing a decline over the past month but a gain across the past 3 months.

At a share price of US$67.50, Delta’s recent 7 day and 30 day share price declines contrast with its stronger 90 day share price return of 16.66%. Longer term total shareholder returns over 3 and 5 years remain much higher than the 1 year total shareholder return of 0.80%, suggesting momentum has cooled in the short term after a strong multi year run.

If Delta’s move has you reassessing airline exposure, it could be a good moment to compare it with other that are also tied to travel and global activity.

With revenue of US$63.36b, net income of US$5.01b and a recent share price of US$67.50 that sits at a discount to both analyst targets and some intrinsic estimates, investors may ask whether this represents a buying opportunity or whether potential future growth is already reflected in the price.

Most Popular Narrative: 9.5% Undervalued

At a last close of $67.50 versus a narrative fair value of $74.61, the most followed view in the market sees measured upside still on the table, driven by specific assumptions on revenue, margins and valuation multiples.

The analysts have a consensus price target of $67.81 for Delta Air Lines based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $90.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $59.0.

Want to see what underpins that fair value gap? The narrative leans on gradual revenue expansion, slightly slimmer margins and a richer future earnings multiple. Curious how those pieces fit together into $74.61 instead of $67.50?

Result: Fair Value of $74.61 (UNDERVALUED)

However, this story can change quickly if economic weakness hits main cabin demand or low cost rivals push harder on pricing and pressure Delta’s margins.

2026 RTIH Innovation Awards

EPoS solutions will be a key focus area at the 2026 RTIH Innovation Awards.

The awards will open for entries in April. They celebrate global retail technology innovation in a fast moving omnichannel world.

Our winners will be revealed at the 2026 RTIH Innovation Awards Ceremony, taking place at The HAC in Central London on Thursday, 15th October.

Check out our 2025 winners here.

Our 2025 hall of fame entrants were revealed during a sold out event which took place at The HAC on 16th October and consisted of a drinks reception, three course meal, and awards ceremony presided over by award winning comedian, actress and writer Tiff Stevenson.

In his welcome speech, Scott Thompson, Founder and Editor, RTIH, said: “This is the awards’ fifth year as a physical event. We started off with just 30 people at the South Place Hotel not far from here, then moved to London Bridge Hotel, then The Barbican, and last year RIBA’s HQ in the West End.”

“But I’m conscious of the fact that, to quote the legend that is Taylor Swift, You’re only as hot as your last hit, baby. So, this year we’ve moved to our biggest venue yet, and also pulled in our largest number of entries to date and broken attendance records.”

He added: “This year’s submissions have without doubt been our best yet. To quote one of the judges: The examples of innovative developments across both traditional and digital retail spaces were truly remarkable.”

Congratulations to our winners, and a big thank you to our sponsors, judging panel, the legend that is Tiff Stevenson, and all those who attended our 2025 gathering.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/590eeff5b8a79b2147a783be/590ef147e6f2e1fda30e84c5/6977a300c017f328db0c7653/1769493625899/Matalan.jpeg?format=1500w,N,,2026-01-27 04:59:23.595318

Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?
The firm was instrumental in orchestrating the merger that created the present-day Kraft Heinz conglomerate.
Shares Face a Persistent Overhang This development places Kraft Heinz equity in a challenging market position.
This looming supply could stifle any potential price recovery before it begins.","Investors in Kraft Heinz are facing a period of heightened uncertainty. The catalyst is a recent regulatory filing that has introduced significant doubt into the market, dampening investor sentiment. The core concern is the possible intention of a major, long-term shareholder to divest a substantial block of stock, a move that has already placed notable downward pressure on the share price.

The source of the anxiety is a prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 20. This document grants Berkshire Hathaway the potential to sell up to 325,442,152 common shares. The market's reaction was swift and pronounced. In after-hours trading following the news, the stock declined by 3.6 percent. The sell-off continued into the next trading session on January 21, with shares falling an additional 5.72 percent.

While Kraft Heinz was quick to clarify that the registration does not guarantee a sale and that Berkshire may retain its holdings—and that the company itself would receive no capital from any such transaction—market observers are reading the situation differently. The registration of such a massive volume, representing a significant portion of a position held since 2015, is widely seen as a strong indicator of a potential strategic retreat by the influential investor.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?

Historical Context Adds Weight

The situation carries extra significance due to Berkshire Hathaway's historical role. The firm was instrumental in orchestrating the merger that created the present-day Kraft Heinz conglomerate. For over a decade, this investment has ranked among the top ten holdings in Warren Buffett's portfolio.

Key facts of the filing:

* Volume Registered: 325,442,152 common shares are available for potential sale.

* Filing Date: The prospectus was submitted on January 20, 2026.

* Market Impact: Immediate and sharp declines in the share price followed the announcement.

* Portfolio Status: The stake has been a core, long-term Top-10 position for Berkshire Hathaway.

Shares Face a Persistent Overhang

This development places Kraft Heinz equity in a challenging market position. The mere prospect of a major shareholder liquidating a huge block of stock creates a substantial supply overhang. This looming supply could stifle any potential price recovery before it begins. In the coming weeks, the market's primary focus will likely be on monitoring for large block trades, which would signal the start of an actual sell-down. As long as the threat of this supply wave persists, the stock's valuation is expected to remain under pressure.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2445681_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 00:00:10.401817

The first earnings season of 2026 is underway, and results from several S&P 500 heavyweights are offering a snapshot of the U.S. economy. From banks navigating interest-rate dynamics and robust capital markets to airlines riding soaring travel demand, the tone thus far has been constructive.

Banks — Resilience Amid Policy Debate

Major banks kicked off earnings with solid results that generally surprised on the upside. Capital One (COF) reported a fourth-quarter earnings beat, with EPS of $3.26 topping FactSet consensus expectations of $3.14. Capital One completed the acquisition of Discover Financial just months ago, but the company is already thinking about how it can further develop its business. CEO Richard D. Fairbank highlighted Capital One’s strategic execution and ambitions: “Our fourth quarter and full year results reflect solid top-line growth… and put us in a strong position going forward. I’m struck by the number and quality of the opportunities we have before us.”

Goldman Sachs (GS) delivered a strong fourth-quarter report. Goldman posted net revenues of $13.45 billion and EPS of $14.01 — easily beating FactSet’s consensus estimate of $11.70 – driven by robust profitability across trading and investment banking revenues. CEO David Solomon underscored the firm’s strategic progress, saying, “We continue to see high levels of client engagement across our franchise and expect momentum to accelerate in 2026.” Goldman is widely regarded as a leader in initial public offering transactions, and this strength has helped it as IPO volumes normalized in 2025.

Over at JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the largest U.S. bank by assets, results on January 13 showed a solid earnings beat on both top- and bottom-line metrics. JPMorgan reported net income of $13 billion with EPS of $4.63 on $46.8 billion in revenue, up about 7 % year-over-year. Excluding a one-time reserve build related to the Apple Card transaction, adjusted earnings rose to about $5.23 per share – well above the FactSet consensus estimate of $4.86

CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the resilience of consumer and business activity, noting ongoing strength in deposit growth, card usage, and market revenues, even as geopolitical tensions and regulatory uncertainty persist. Dimon emphasized that ongoing investments — including JPMorgan’s planned role as the new issuer of the Apple Card — reflect a long-term view on growth.

Airlines — Premium Demand Lifts Results

United Airlines (UAL) posted a better-than-expected quarter with revenue climbing nearly 5% as premium and loyalty offerings led the way. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $3.10, above FactSet’s consensus estimate of $2.90. CEO Scott Kirby pointed to sustained momentum, saying strong demand trends extend into 2026 and underpin ambitious adjusted earnings-per-share forecasts.

Delta Air Lines (DAL) reported record revenue and impressive free cash flow in the December quarter. The airline reported adjusted EPS of $1.55, just above FactSet consensus expectations of $1.53. CEO Ed Bastian attributed much of that success to the carrier’s focus on premium travel and loyal customers, saying, “I don’t think we’ve ever had premium as a larger percent of our total revenues as we do right now.”

In total, earnings season is off to a good start for the S&P 500. Banks are showing strength in spending and lending while accelerating in capital markets. Airlines are benefiting from robust demand for premium offerings as travel hits record levels. These reports come ahead of the S&P 500’s biggest test, as many top tech firms report this week.

We’ll now examine how L’Oréal’s planned Hyderabad AI tech hub reshapes the company’s investment narrative and long-term competitive positioning.

The end of cancer? These like cancer and Alzheimer's.

What Is L'Oréal's Investment Narrative?

To own L’Oréal, you need to be comfortable paying a premium multiple for a global beauty leader whose growth profile is solid but not explosive, with earnings expected to rise in the high single digits and revenue in the mid single digits. Near term, the key catalysts remain the February 12 results, any color on the “Beauty Stimulus” plan, and how the refreshed leadership bench executes in North America. Against that backdrop, the new Hyderabad AI tech hub looks more like a long-term capability bet than a near-term earnings driver, although the size of the €350 million commitment underlines how seriously L’Oréal is treating data, AI and India as ingredients of its future. The main risk is that this level of innovation and capital spend does not fully justify the current valuation premium.

However, the premium price tag may already be baking in very optimistic execution. L'Oréal's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 6%. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly €286 to €409, underlining how differently private investors view L’Oréal’s premium pricing and AI push. You can weigh those views against the current reliance on upcoming results and execution in the US and India, which could influence how sustainable that premium really is over time.

- why the stock might be worth as much as 6% more than the current price!

The tech giant added that Maia 200 has three times the FP4 performance of Amazon's third-gen Trainium chip and better FP8 performance than Google's seventh-gen TPU.

FP4 and FP8 refer to 4-bit and 8-bit floating-point formats. FP8 is generally used for low-precision AI work because it balances accuracy and speed. NVIDIA has a full explainer on Floating Point and how it relates to AI.

Latest Videos From Windows Central

Microsoft states that in addition to having better performance in certain areas, Maia 200 is more efficient than competing chips. Maia delivers 30% better performance per dollar than the previous generation of hardware used by Microsoft.

Maia 200 has already been deployed in Microsoft's datacenter region near Des Moines, Iowa. The US West 3 datacenter region near Phoenix, Arizona will be the next to see Maia 200 used.

In a video explaining the Maia 200, Microsoft Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie noted that the chip is designed to be cooled with water, which is more efficient than air cooling. Guthrie also highlighted ""zero water waste"" by the chip and noted that Maia 200 can be used in a way that ""protects the environment and the communities that [Microsoft runs] in.""

Microsoft has been criticized for how much electricity and water is used by data centers. The company announced plans to build ""Community-First"" AI infrastructure, though the tech giant was mocked for the announcement.

Why this matters

OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is one of the hottest names in tech. It is also on pace to lose billions of dollars in 2026. Reports suggest the company could lose as much as $14 billion just this year.

Training AI models takes a tremendous amount of computing power, but that is far from the only cost of operating LLMs. Even after a model is trained, running that model costs money for each use.

Microsoft claims that Maia 200 is the most efficient inference system the company has deployed and that it delivers 30% better performance per dollar than the latest generation of hardware used by the tech giant.

Those figures could drastically reduce operation costs for OpenAI and other companies that use Maia 200.

""Maia 200 is part of our heterogenous AI infrastructure and will serve multiple models, including the latest GPT-5.2 models from OpenAI, bringing performance per dollar advantage to Microsoft Foundry and Microsoft 365 Copilot,"" said Microsoft.

Maia 200 is an inference accelerator. It is engineered to make AI token generation more affordable. Training a model is a massive one-time expense. Inference is the process of the AI actually answering a user. This is a continuous daily cost. Microsoft optimized this chip specifically for that task. The goal is to slash the ""per-token"" cost of running services like ChatGPT and Copilot.

If Maia 200 delivers in the way Microsoft described, the chip will help reduce the costs of operating LLMs, which could significantly help OpenAI and other companies that use the chip.

Microsoft says this chip will save money in token costs. Do you think custom silicon is enough to make AI profitable by 2027? Let us know in the comments.

What do you think?

Can custom chips like Maia 200 save OpenAI from its massive losses?

Yes, efficiency is the key.

No, the costs are growing too fast.

Only if OpenAI starts charging more.

Artificial intelligence (AI) companies are driving a spike in the price of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips as they build out data centres for their power- and processing-hungry applications. According to The Register consumer prices for the most common memory capacities jumped up 63 per cent in Europe during the final quarter of 2025.

Analysts from S&P Global and UBS say this will have a knock-on effect to the automotive sector as chip-makers are likely to prioritise high-margin data centre customers over automakers and automotive suppliers.

Matthew Beecham from S&P Global predicts prices for automotive-grade DRAM could jump 70 to 100 per cent, which will likely cause “panic buying and production disruptions across the industry”.

UBS believes automakers who prioritise autonomous driving systems, such as Tesla and Rivian, are more at risk than legacy manufacturers such as Ford and General Motors. The investment bank believes disruption to automotive supply chains could start as soon as the second quarter of this year.

Time will tell if this potential chip shortage is as disruptive to the automotive industry as the one experienced by the sector post-COVID.

At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 many automakers slashed their forward orders for computer chips in anticipation of a recession and a prolonged slump in demand.

When economies across the world bounced back faster than expected, automakers found themselves at the back of the queue for semiconductors, forcing them to wind back production.

As the year begins, the geopolitical situation surrounding Greenland's sovereignty dispute is expected to cool down, as President Trump of the United States refrains from imposing tariffs on several European countries. However, it remains difficult to foresee how a deal regarding Greenland would be reached, or what else President Trump could propose to ""win"" over Europe.

NEW YORK, NY – The New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) marks a workers justice milestone as key amendments to the City's Delivery Worker Laws go into full effect today, January 26, 2026.

The new laws strengthen rights for contracted grocery and food delivery workers. These include Local Law 113, which increases delivery worker pay transparency; Local Laws 123 and 124, which expand the minimum pay rate (MPR) to cover third-party grocery delivery workers, give timely and weekly payment rights to more contracted delivery workers, and improve bathroom access for contracted delivery workers; and Local Laws 107 and 108, which require restaurant and grocery apps to offer a tipping option at checkout. As a DCWP report revealed, DoorDash and Uber engineered design tricks in their interfaces that lowered workers’ tip earnings by $550 million. Those tricks are now illegal.

These reforms build on the City's pioneering 2023 minimum pay rate rule, which dramatically increased workers’ average hourly earnings without reducing deliveries. Today DCWP also announces a citywide inflation adjustment to worker pay under the framework established by Local Law 115 of 2021. The MPR will increase from $21.44 an hour to $22.13 an hour for both grocery and food delivery workers, a 3.2% increase that is set to take effect on April 1, 2026.

Key worker protection laws effective January 26, 2026 address:

Expanded minimum pay protections: Grocery delivery apps (including Instacart) must now pay workers at least $21.44 an hour (excluding tips) with annual increases, matching the rate for food delivery workers. In 2025, the City Council overrode Eric Adams’ initial veto of this legislation.

Timely payments and transparency: Apps must pay workers no later than seven calendar days after the end of a pay period and provide detailed, itemized written statements with compensation calculations.

Tipping fairness: Platforms must offer customers a clear tip option before or at checkout, including a suggested tip of at least 10% of the purchase price or a custom amount. This directly counters practices that hid or delayed tip prompts, which a recent DCWP report found cost workers over $550 million.

Today’s victory is buttressed by two recent federal court decisions. In 2025, DoorDash and Uber filed a federal lawsuit against DCWP challenging Local Laws 107 and 108 (tipping), while Instacart did the same to challenge Local Laws 123 and 124 (grocery delivery workers). On January 23, 2026, federal judges ruled decisively on the side of workers and denied the apps’ requests for a preliminary injunction in both cases.

These expanded Worker Protection Laws go into effect as the Mamdani Administration ramps up efforts to crack down on predatory delivery apps, reverse worker losses through aggressive enforcement of the Delivery Worker Laws, and hold companies and individuals accountable for ripping off the hardworking, majority immigrant deliveristas who keep New Yorkers fed. Earlier this month, Commissioner Levine announced a lawsuit against Motoclick and sent compliance warnings to over 60 companies including Instacart, DoorDash, Grubhub, Uber, and other app companies, warning them to adhere to the new laws.

The Minimum Pay Rate (MPR) for app-based delivery workers must be adjusted for inflation each year. The MPR will increase to $22.13 the first pay period on or after April 1, 2026. The $22.13 rate reflects a 3.2% adjustment for inflation between December 2024 and December 2025.

“Our administration has zero tolerance for corporate abuse, deceptive practices, or an economy that leaves working New Yorkers behind,” said Mayor Zohran Kwame Mamdani. “These laws move us closer to a city delivery workers can afford — a city where their labor is respected, their pay is fair and transparent, and they can earn tips without limitations. That’s what economic justice looks like in practice.”

""New York City refuses to let multi-billion-dollar corporations exploit hardworking deliveristas,"" said DCWP Commissioner Samuel A.A. Levine. ""Since we began enforcing the minimum pay rate in 2023, workers have taken home an additional $1.2 billion in earnings. The laws that go into effect today build on that success by closing loopholes, ending design tricks that depressed tips by hundreds of millions, and guaranteeing grocery workers the same baseline pay as food delivery workers. This is what a worker-centered economy looks like.""

The NYC Department of Consumer and Worker Protection (DCWP) is the nation’s leading municipal enforcement agency charged with delivering New Yorkers economic justice and an affordable city. DCWP leverages its authority to deliver real economic relief to New Yorkers and protect them from predatory, deceptive, and unfair practices that violate their consumer and workers’ rights. This includes pioneering cutting-edge protections, such as the City’s Consumer Protection Law, Protected Time Off Law, Fair Workweek Law, and Delivery Workers Laws, including the Minimum Pay Rate for delivery workers. While licensing more than 45,000 businesses in over 45 industries, we also ensure fair competition and a level playing field for responsible small businesses that are integral to New York City’s vibrant communities. DCWP also provides essential services, such as free tax preparation and financial counseling to ensure New Yorkers keep more of what they earn and can plan for their future. Across our mission, DCWP is committed to strengthening our communities and making New York City a fairer, more affordable place to live.

The vote of confidence from Wall Street comes, as investors are trying to parse whether they can expect a good year for U.S. airline stocks. Investors are wary of being burned again by the industry, after having had a bright outlook for 2025, only to see their plans undone by a series of unexpected, macro headwinds that were beyond their control.

Alaska Airlines' Promising Guidance

Even those like UBS, which maintained its previous price targets, saw substantial growth ahead for the stock, according to a research note published Sunday. UBS kept its $77 price target on the stock, which points to potential upside of more than 50%.

""We think the ALK stock has substantial upside from here,"" UBS analysts wrote. ""ALK's revenues are off to a strong start in January with [first quarter] corporate held bookings up 20% on a tough year over year compare.""

UBS's price target is one of the highest for Alaska Air Group stock. The mean price target is $70.87, according to FactSet.

The focus for the likes of UBS was on Alaska Air Group's 2026 guidance rather than its fourth quarter earnings. Alaska Air Group forecast earnings per share of between $3.50 and $6.50 for this year. In 2025, Alaska Air Group delivered EPS of $2.44.

Stock Market Today: Stock Market News And Analysis

The wide range in the earnings forecast maps the current extent in macroeconomic uncertainties, like jet fuel prices, consumer anxiety and another possible government shutdown, which could force cancellations. All could affect earnings, as they did in 2025, according to UBS.

""In our view, (the wide range) is prudent and limits the risk of any downward revision from here, especially given small movements in fuel can also swing Alaska Air Group's [full-year 2026] EPS,"" analysts wrote.

A 10-cent-per-gallon change in fuel prices equates to $0.75 in earnings per share, per UBS's estimates.

Airlines Reporting Later This Week

Several other airlines are set to report earnings this week. Their outlooks for the year will inform the degree to which investors believe U.S. airlines may recover after lagging their international peers in 2025.

On Tuesday, JetBlue (JBLU) and American Airlines (AAL) will both release earnings.

Analysts expect JetBlue's full-year 2025 results to be losses of $1.61 per share on $9.035 billion in revenue, according to FactSet. Both of those numbers would be worse than 2024, when JetBlue had losses of 71 cents a share and $9.279 billion in revenue.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Meanwhile, Wall Street expects American Airlines' revenue growth of just under 1% for 2025. Earnings per share are forecast at 56 cents apiece, below an October guidance of between 65 cents and 95 cents.

Two days later, on Thursday, Southwest Airlines (LUV) will report its latest results. Unlike its peers, Southwest comes into its upcoming earnings release with a rosier outlook. Earnings per share are projected to remain flat year over year at 96 cents, with revenue rising 2.3% to $28.116 billion, according to FactSet.

Airline Stocks

Southwest's promising forecasts come after a year in which its stock managed to perform well, when many of its rivals struggled.

Over the last 12 months Southwest stock is up more than 30%.

Meanwhile, its fellow budget carriers Alaska Airlines and JetBlue sank 26% and 33% over the same time frame. American stock decreased close to 14% over the past year.

That said, many U.S. airline stocks started to recover in the back half of last year. American and JetBlue are both up about 15% over the last six months, and Southwest just over 12%. Investors will be looking to see which of the airlines reporting this week will be able to maintain that momentum. Alaska remains down close to 6% over the same time frame.

The fourth quarter earnings season kicks into high gear this week, with Big Tech results from Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL) headlining the earnings calendar.

An optimistic consensus is forming: As of Jan. 23, 13% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies have reported fourth quarter results, according to FactSet data, and Wall Street analysts estimate an 8.2% increase in earnings per share for the fourth quarter. If that rate holds, it would represent the 10th consecutive quarter of annual earnings growth for the index.

Heading into the reporting period, analysts were expecting an 8.3% jump in earnings per share, down from the third quarter's 13.6% earnings growth rate. Wall Street has raised its earnings expectations in recent months, especially for tech companies, which have driven earnings growth in recent quarters.

Prediction Market powered by

Although Big Tech continues to set the tone, this earnings season promises to test the improved stock market breadth that has emerged at the start of 2026. Plus, the themes that drove the markets in 2025 — artificial intelligence, the Trump administration's tariff and economic policies, and a K-shaped consumer economy — will continue to provide plenty for investors to parse.

In addition to the reports from four of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, Wall Street will receive updates from a wide swath of companies across the economy, including UnitedHealth (UNH), Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), IBM (IBM), Starbucks (SBUX), Levi Strauss (LEVI), Visa (V), American Express (AXP), Mastercard (MA), Caterpillar (CAT), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), AT&T (T), and Verizon (VZ),

Nucor stock falls after steelmaker's earnings miss

Nucor's (NUE) fourth quarter results missed Wall Street expectations due to lower volumes and compressed margins from higher steel prices.

The Charlotte, N.C.-based steel manufacturer reported earnings per share of $1.64, compared to estimates of $1.77, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $7.69 billion also missed expectations for $7.9 billion in sales, led by quarter-over-quarter sales declines in the steel mills and steel products segments.

Nucor stock declined 3% in after-hours trading. The stock was down 2% during Monday's session following Steel Dynamics' (STLD) Q4 results.

Like Steel Dynamics, Nucor offered some optimism for the quarter ahead, saying that it's seeing ""robust demand"" in several end markets as well as ""strong backlogs."" The company also said it was encouraged by federal policies in place, such as import tariffs on steel and steel products.

The company said it expects earnings to rise in Q1 across all segments but did not offer specific guidance yet. Nucor's earnings call will take place on Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. You can listen to it on Yahoo Finance.

Baker Hughes stock rises on earnings beat

Houston-based oil field services company Baker Hughes (BKR) reported fourth quarter earnings on Sunday that beat analyst expectations as the company's focus on liquefied natural gas and industrial energy infrastructure paid off.

Baker Hughes reported earnings per share of $0.88, which was better than the $0.67 per share Wall Street was expecting, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $7.3 billion also came in higher than the Street estimate of $7 billion.

The stock rose more than 2% in premarket trading.

The Industrial & Energy Technology segment saw continued strength and secured a record backlog of $32.4 billion, the company said.

""Looking ahead, we expect IET orders to remain at robust levels, supported by continued momentum in LNG, a stronger year of FPSO [floating production storage and offloading] and gas infrastructure awards, and sustained strength for power systems,"" Baker Hughes CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said in the earnings release. ""Against this favorable backdrop, we project similar levels of organic IET orders in 2026.""

Big Tech expected to drive earnings growth for S&P 500 in Q4

Next week, four of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks report results: Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Apple (AAPL).

There are a couple of reasons why markets will be closely watching these reports. For one, anything related to artificial intelligence continues to drive the markets. And for another, the Magnificent Seven names have been the top contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth in recent quarters.

Those trends are expected to continue in the fourth quarter reporting season. According to a note by FactSet's senior earnings analyst John Butters, analysts expect Magnificent Seven companies to report earnings growth of 20.3% in aggregate for Q4. For the remaining 493 companies in the S&P 500, the aggregated earnings growth rate is expected at 4.1%.

Alaska Air stock jumps as airline touts growing demand for premium seats

Alaska Air Group (ALK) saw progress in its premium seat and international flight push in the latest sign of airline competition for high-income customers.

On Thursday, the airline reported adjusted earnings of $0.43, above consensus estimates of $0.11 per share, according to data compiled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Revenue of $3.6 billion was roughly in line with analyst estimates on annual capacity growth of 2.2%.

Alaska Air primarily operates routes along the US West Coast and plans to expand its international flights from two to five to eventually 12, including flights to London and Rome. The stock rose 6.6% on Friday afternoon.

Echoing results from Delta (DAL) and United (UAL), Alaska Air said it saw strong demand in its premium segment in its earnings call on Friday.

First Class and Premium Class revenues grew 7.1% year over year, compared to a 2.4% decline for Main Cabin revenues. However, even Main Cabin sales saw some improvement from the third quarter, the company said.

""We've really seen the improvement in the demand profile across every segment of the business, ... certainly, premium and loyalty are the biggest drivers of that,"" CFO Shane Tackett said on the earnings call. ""But I think we actually like the trends we're seeing in Main Cabin right now.""

Booz Allen Hamilton stock jumps as civil government business starts to 'reignite'

Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation (BAH) said its contract pipeline was accelerating again after a year of government cost-cutting efforts from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) pressured the defense consultancy's business.

""Our national security business continues to see good growth and very good prospects, but I think what's really exciting to us is our civil business is starting to reignite,"" CEO Horacio Rozanski said on the earnings call, adding, ""The market does feel like it's at an inflection point.""

The company's sales backlog rose 2% year over year to $38 billion in the third quarter.

Overall revenue in the third quarter declined 10% year over year to $2.6 billion, missing Wall Street estimates of $2.7 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. But adjusted profits rose to $1.77 per share, beating analysts' estimates of $1.27.

The stock jumped by 6% in premarket trading on Friday on Booz Allen Hamilton's upbeat earnings guidance.

The company slightly lowered the top end of its full-year revenue guidance to a range of $11.3 billion-$11.4 billion from $11.3 billion-$11.5 billion previously. But it raised its adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance to $5.95-$6.15 from $5.45-$5.65 previously.

Alcoa stock gains as aluminum prices boost earnings

Aluminum producer Alcoa (AA) stock gained in after-hours trading following top- and bottom-line beats, as higher aluminum prices boosted results despite lower shipments.

Alcoa posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 for the fourth quarter, above estimates for $1.01, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Unadjusted earnings of $0.85 per share missed estimates, which the company attributed to an $337 million investment loss from its Saudi Arabian mining company Ma’aden, $144 million goodwill impairment charge, and currency fluctuations.

Revenue increased 15% year over year to $3.4 billion, above estimates of $3.27 billion. The company said its aluminum production increased 5% while alumina production decreased 4% year over year. The increase in aluminum prices, more than offset the higher tariff costs on Canadian aluminum imported to the US, the company said.

Alcoa stock rose 1.6% on Thursday afternoon and is up 18% year to date.

Capital One (COF) stock slid in extended trading hours after the financial company announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire fintech company Brex Inc. for $5.15 billion in 50% cash and 50% stock.

Brex provides business credit cards, spending accounts, and expense management software. The acquisition is Capital One's latest expansion into fintech after it bought Discover for $35 billion last year.

Total net revenue increased 1% year over year to $15.6 billion, also coming in above estimates for $15.4 billion in revenue.

Gold and copper miner Freeport McMoRan reports earnings beat but production decline

Freeport McMoran (FCX) beat adjusted earnings and revenue estimates for the fourth quarter, but reported lower production of the copper, gold, and molybdenum it mines. The stock fell fractionally in midday trading on Thursday.

Freeport McMoran said it produced 640 million pounds of copper, 65,000 ounces of gold, and 25 million pounds of molybdenum in the fourth quarter, down from the 1.04 billion pounds of copper, 432,000 ounces of gold, and 22 million pounds of molybdenum it produced in the same quarter a year ago.

Copper production was severely hit after a deadly mudslide in September took out the company's Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia, the world's second-largest copper mine. On the earnings call, CEO Kathleen Quirk said the closure impacted copper volumes by 10% for the year compared to its forecasts going into 2025.

Quirk said the company is on track to resume operations at the Grasberg mine in the second quarter of 2026, and Freeport McMoRan COO of the Indonesia business Mark Johnson added that he doesn't see ""any real hurdles at this point to be able to start up as we planned.""

For the fourth quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings of $0.47 on revenue of $5.6 billion. Wall Street analysts were looking for adjusted earnings of $0.32 on revenue of $5.3 billion.

A rally in copper and gold prices last year helped boost the miner's results, though that boom is widely expected to slow or even backtrack in 2026.

""Global inventories of copper on exchanges have risen in recent months, during a period of sharp increases in copper prices,"" Quirk said on the earnings call. ""Most analysts are projecting that the market will be tightly balanced during 2026 with some projecting deficits and other small surpluses.""

Halliburton stock climbs after the oil services giant posts better-than-expected profits

Oil services provider Halliburton (HAL) posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter, sending its shares up 2%.

The Houston-based company reported profits of $0.70 per diluted share, beating Wall Street estimates of $0.55 per share, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Profits were flat from a year ago, when the company also posted earnings of $0.70 per share.

Revenue of $5.7 billion also came in stronger than the $5.4 billion estimated. It was also higher than the $5.6 billion in revenue reported a year ago.

Halliburton's revenue in its Completion and Production segment was roughly unchanged from a year ago at $3.3 billion, while revenue in the Drilling and Evaluation unit was $2.4 billion, also flat.

While the oil majors have shown reluctance in exploring Venezuelan oil following the US's removal of Nicolás Maduro (ExxonMobil's (XOM) CEO called it ""uninvestable""), oil infrastructure companies like Halliburton have shown more eagerness to revisit the country.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that the company has started looking at resumes for roles in the country, in a sign that Halliburton may be ready to reenter Venezuela.

Initial ads in ChatGPT are expected to cost about $60 per 1,000 views, comparable to live NFL games and targeted streaming inventory, per The Information.

Initial ads in ChatGPT are expected to cost about $60 per 1,000 views, comparable to live NFL games and targeted streaming inventory, per The Information.

The company is using premium pricing to do two things at once: Boost revenues to offset spending and set a high anchor price ahead of a larger advertising expansion.

Why it’s worth watching: OpenAI’s ad pricing comes in far above Meta’s, where CPMs average under $20. Meta’s typical CPM range is $10 to $15, with a “typical maximum” of $15 to $20 and an “extreme maximum” above $20, per Affect Group.

It can charge more because ChatGPT sits earlier in customers’ decision cycle. Prompts often show raw, brand-open intent, like “durable winter boots,” before a shopper commits to a retailer, keyword, or brand list.

OpenAI’s early advertiser outreach is going directly to large, established brands via agencies rather than building the business on small advertisers, per The Information. The ads, which will appear at the bottom of ChatGPT responses, will be clearly labeled and separated from organic answers—prioritizing trust while testing commercial viability.

The challenge: Early reporting is expected to include impressions and total clicks, not the deep context marketers use to justify premium spend at scale—like what prompt triggered the ad, what ChatGPT answered, and whether the ad led to a purchase.

Without query-level intent visibility and conversion tracking, brands can’t optimize confidently or validate what the channel is worth.

Implications for marketers: ChatGPT ads are expensive, but they put brands inside the moment a consumer is still deciding. That’s the benefit, but the risk is paying NFL-level rates for TV-style reporting.

Recommendations:

Test early to gain first-mover advantage. Low competition could make $60 CPMs tolerable.

Choose categories you want ads to appear in, test different creative for common prompts, and watch whether more people start searching for your brand or product by name.

Demand proof fast. If OpenAI can’t tie exposure to downstream outcomes, budgets won’t scale.

For more updates on the intersection of AI and enterprise tech, stay tuned to the Tech Buzz","As the ""AI-first"" era of enterprise technology moves from experimentation to massive deployment, IBM is doubling down on the engine that drives its market reach: its partners.

In a major strategic update announced today, Kareem Yusuf, Ph.D., IBM’s Senior Vice President of Ecosystems and Strategic Partners, unveiled a significant acceleration of the IBM Partner Plus program. The move is designed to streamline how businesses buy and deploy AI by empowering a global network of resellers, service providers, and ISVs with new incentives and AI-driven tools.

A New Blueprint for the AI Economy

The shift in how businesses consume technology—increasingly through hyperscaler marketplaces and automated platforms—has forced a rethink of traditional channel models. Yusuf noted that meeting current client demand requires ""more than great products,"" calling for an ecosystem that moves with ""speed, clarity, and shared outcomes.""

To meet this need, IBM is introducing several key enhancements for 2026:

AI-Driven Selling Experiences: Leveraging IBM’s own internal tech stack, partners will have access to new tools to identify opportunities and close deals with higher velocity.

Streamlined Routes to Market: IBM is prioritizing ""frictionless"" commerce by optimizing self-service, e-commerce, and major hyperscaler marketplaces.

The ""Agent Connect"" Initiative: A new focus on IBM Agent Connect aims to bridge the gap between IBM’s direct sellers and its partner network, ensuring better alignment on complex enterprise deals.

Scalable Co-Marketing & Incentives: Enhanced funding and automated incentive structures are being rolled out to help resellers and service partners scale their pipeline more aggressively.

Tailored Support for a Diverse Ecosystem

The 2026 strategy isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. IBM has recalibrated its coverage model to support different partner types:

For Resellers: The focus is on removing friction, automating business processes, and strengthening the product offers that drive high-volume pipeline.

For Service Partners: IBM is investing in resources to help consultants and integrators embed IBM technology (like watsonx) into their own proprietary service offerings.

For ISVs (Software Vendors): IBM is positioning itself as the foundational layer, providing the guidance and technical architecture for developers to build their own AI-competitive solutions on IBM tech.

Why This Matters for the Tech Sector

IBM’s aggressive pivot toward a partner-centric model highlights a broader trend in the industry: the complexity of GenAI deployment is too vast for any one company to handle alone. By tightening the bond between its technology and the thousands of partners who influence client decisions, IBM is positioning itself to be the ""infrastructure of choice"" for the next wave of AI adoption.

""The outcomes we’re driving toward—volume, velocity, and ultimately revenue growth and reach—remain straightforward and consistent,"" said Yusuf.

As we head further into 2026, the success of IBM’s AI ambitions will likely hinge on how well this ""vibrant ecosystem"" can translate raw AI power into real-world business results.

Context News

Regional lender U.S. Bancorp said on January 13 that it had agreed to buy banking and trading boutique BTIG for as much as $1 billion to expand in M&A and equities.

Under the terms of the transaction, U.S. Bancorp will pay $725 million in cash and about 6.6 million in shares upfront, with an additional $275 million in cash payable over three years, contingent on hitting certain performance targets. The addition of BTIG, founded in 2002, will bring U.S. Bancorp about $750 million of mostly fee-based revenue annually, it said.

Goldman Sachs, which invested in BTIG in 2007, is advising the firm on the deal.

Digital EURO STOXX 50® Index-Linked Global Medium-Term Notes, Series A, due

The notes will not bear interest. The amount that you will be paid on your notes on the stated maturity date (expected to be the second scheduled business day after the determination date) is based on the performance of the EURO STOXX 50® Index (which we refer to as the underlier) as measured from and including the trade date to and including the determination date (expected to be between 16 and 18 months after the trade date). If the final underlier level on the determination date is greater than or equal to 87.50% of the initial underlier level (set on the trade date and is expected to be the closing level of the underlier on the trade date), you will receive the maximum settlement amount, which is expected to be the threshold settlement amount (expected to be between $1,108.80 and $1,127.90 for each $1,000 face amount of your notes). If the final underlier level is less than 87.50% of the initial underlier level, the return on your notes will be negative.

You could lose your entire investment in the notes. Any payment on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power (as described on page PS-3 of this pricing supplement) by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

To determine your payment at maturity, we will calculate the underlier return, which is the percentage increase or decrease in the final underlier level from the initial underlier level. On the stated maturity date, for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, you will receive an amount in cash equal to:

·if the underlier return is greater than or equal to -12.50% (the final underlier level is greater than or equal to 87.50% of the initial underlier level), the maximum settlement amount; or

·if the underlier return is negative and is below -12.50% (the final underlier level is less than the initial underlier level by more than 12.50%), the sum of (i) $1,000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1,000 times (b) approximately 1.1429 times (c) the sum of the underlier return plus 12.50% (in which case you will receive less than $1,000).

Because we have provided only a brief summary of the terms of your notes above, you should read the detailed description of the terms of the notes found in “Summary Information” on page PS-2 in this pricing supplement.

Your investment in the notes involves certain risks, including among other things, our credit risk and the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” beginning on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement so that you may better understand those risks.

Pricing Supplement dated January , 2026

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The final terms for the notes will be determined on the date the notes are initially priced for sale to the public (the “trade date”) based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the trade date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables, such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the trade date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the notes on the trade date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the notes and our estimated value of the notes is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the notes. These other costs will include a fee paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering.

Our estimated value on the trade date is not a prediction of the price at which the notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another

PS- 2

affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the trade date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the trade date for a temporary period expected to be approximately three months after the initial issue date of the notes because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the notes and other costs in connection with the notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial issue date of the notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the notes at any time prior to the trade date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the notes prior to their trade date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the notes), by acquiring the notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the notes may have at law if

KEY TERMS

Issuer: Barclays Bank PLC

Underlier: the EURO STOXX 50® Index (Bloomberg ticker symbol, “SX5E <Index>”), as calculated, maintained and published by STOXX Limited

Specified currency: U.S. dollars (“$”)

Face amount: each note will have a face amount of $1,000; $ in the aggregate for all the notes

Purchase at amount other than face amount: the amount we will pay you at the stated maturity date for your notes will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for your notes, so if you acquire notes at a premium (or discount) to face amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, it could affect your investment in a number of ways. The return on your investment in such notes will be lower (or higher) than it would have been had you purchased the notes at face amount. Also, the stated threshold level would not offer the same measure of protection to your investment as would be the case if you had purchased the notes at face amount. See “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Notes Generally—If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Face Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Face Amount or a Discount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected” on page PS-12 of this pricing supplement.

Cash settlement amount (on the stated maturity date): for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, we will pay you on the stated maturity date an amount in cash equal to:

·if the final underlier level is greater than or equal to the threshold level, the threshold settlement amount; or

·if the final underlier level is less than the threshold level, the sum of (1) $1,000 plus (2) the product of (i) $1,000 times (ii) the buffer rate times (iii) the sum of the underlier return plus the threshold amount (in which case you will receive less than $1,000).

Any payment on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is not guaranteed by any third party and is subject to (a) the creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC, and (b) the risk of exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Initial underlier level (to be set on the trade date): , the closing level of the underlier on the trade date

Final underlier level: the closing level of the underlier on the determination date, subject to adjustment in limited circumstances as provided under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement; and subject to market disruption events and non-trading days as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

PS- 4

Underlier return: the quotient of (1) the final underlier level minus the initial underlier level divided by (2) the initial underlier level, expressed as a percentage

Threshold level: 87.50% of the initial underlier level

Threshold amount: 12.50%

Threshold settlement amount (to be set on the trade date): expected to be between $1,108.80 and $1,127.90

Cap level (to be set on the trade date): expected to be between 110.88% and 112.79% of the initial underlier level

Maximum settlement amount (to be set on the trade date): expected to be the threshold settlement amount

Buffer rate: the quotient of the initial underlier level divided by the threshold level, which equals approximately 114.29%

Trade date:

Original issue date (settlement date): expected to be three scheduled business days following the trade date

Determination date (to be set on the trade date): a specified date that is expected to be between 16 and 18 months after the trade date, subject to postponement in the event of a market disruption event or non-trading day as described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the determination date be postponed by more than five trading days.

Stated maturity date (to be set on the trade date): a specified date that is expected to be the second scheduled business day after the determination date. The maturity date will be postponed if the determination date is postponed due to the occurrence or continuance of a market disruption event or a non-trading day on the determination date. In such a case, the maturity date will be postponed by the same number of business days from but excluding the originally scheduled determination date to and including the actual determination date. The maturity date will also be postponed if that date is not a business day. See “Terms of the Notes—Payment Dates” on page S-46 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Reference Assets—Indices—Market Disruption Events for Securities with an Equity Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-87 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.

No interest: the notes will not bear interest

No listing: the notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or interdealer quotation system

No redemption: the notes will not be subject to redemption right or price dependent redemption right

Closing level: as provided on page S-86 of the accompanying prospectus supplement. The closing level of the underlier reported on the Bloomberg Professional® service (“Bloomberg”) page may be lower or higher than the official closing level of the underlier published by the underlier sponsor. In certain circumstances, the closing level of the underlier will be based on the alternate calculation of the underlier described under “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Business day: as defined under “Terms of the Notes—Business Day” on page S-47 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Trading day: notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the accompanying prospectus supplement, with respect to the underlier, a day, as determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion, on which the underlier is calculated and published by the underlier sponsor. Therefore, a day would be a trading day

PS- 5

regardless of whether one or more of the principal securities markets for the underlier stocks of the underlier are closed on that day, if the underlier sponsor publishes the underlier level on that day

Use of proceeds and hedging: as described under “Use of Proceeds and Hedging” on page S-115 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Tax consequences: you should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the notes.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, it is reasonable to treat the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the underlier. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the notes (including redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the notes. This gain or loss on your notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of notes at the original issue price. However, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

ERISA: as described under “Benefit Plan Investor Considerations” on page S-101 of the accompanying prospectus supplement

Supplemental plan of distribution: we will agree to sell to Barclays Capital Inc. (the “agent”), and the agent will agree to purchase from us, the face amount of the notes at the price specified on the cover of this pricing supplement. The agent will commit to take and pay for all of the notes, if any are taken. The agent proposes initially to offer the notes to the public at the initial issue price set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement.

We expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment for the notes on the original issue date, which is more than one business day following the trade date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in one business day, unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on any date prior to one business day before delivery will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own advisor.

We have been advised by Barclays Capital Inc. that it intends to make a market in the notes. However, neither Barclays Capital Inc. nor any of our affiliates that makes a market is obligated to do so and any of

PS- 6

them may stop doing so at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity or trading market for the notes.

Calculation agent: Barclays Bank PLC

CUSIP no.: 06749FEW5

ISIN no.: US06749FEW59

Conflicts of interest: Barclays Capital Inc. is an affiliate of Barclays Bank PLC and, as such, has a “conflict of interest” in this offering within the meaning of Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. Consequently, the offering is being conducted in compliance with the provisions of Rule 5121. Barclays Capital Inc. is not permitted to sell notes in this offering to an account over which it exercises discretionary authority without the prior specific written approval of the account holder.

FDIC: the notes are not bank deposits and are not insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) or any other governmental agency, nor are they obligations of, or guaranteed by, a bank.

SUPPLEMENTAL TERMS OF THE NOTES

For purposes of the notes offered by this pricing supplement, all references to each of the following terms used in the accompanying prospectus supplement will be deemed to refer to the corresponding term used in this pricing supplement as set forth in the table below:

Prospectus Supplement Term Pricing Supplement Term Reference asset underlier Payment at maturity cash settlement amount Maturity date stated maturity date Principal amount face amount Initial level initial underlier level Final level final underlier level Initial valuation date trade date Scheduled trading day trading day Reference asset sponsor underlier sponsor

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLES

The following table and chart are provided for purposes of illustration only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and are intended merely to illustrate the impact that the various hypothetical closing levels on the determination date could have on the cash settlement amount at maturity assuming all other variables remain constant.

The examples below are based on a range of final underlier levels that are entirely hypothetical; no one can predict what the closing level will be on any day throughout the term of your notes, and no one can predict what the final underlier level will be on the determination date. The underlier has been highly volatile in the past—meaning that the closing level has changed considerably in relatively short periods—and its performance cannot be predicted for any future period.

The information in the following examples reflects hypothetical rates of return on the notes assuming that they are purchased on the original issue date at the face amount and held to the stated maturity date. If you sell your notes in a secondary market prior to the stated maturity date, your return will depend upon the market value of your notes at the time of sale, which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the table below, such as interest rates, the volatility of the underlier and our creditworthiness. In addition, assuming no changes in market conditions or our creditworthiness and any other relevant factors, the value of your notes on the trade date will, and the price you may receive for your notes may, be significantly less than the initial issue price. For more information on the value of your notes in the secondary market, see “Risk Factors” on page S-9 of the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, if Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, if Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes” on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement. The information in the table also reflects the key hypothetical terms and assumptions in the following box.

Key Hypothetical Terms and Assumptions Face amount $1,000 Cap level 110.88% of the initial underlier level Threshold settlement amount $1,108.80 Threshold level 87.50% of the initial underlier level Buffer rate approximately 114.29% Threshold amount 12.50% Neither a market disruption event nor a non-trading day occurs on the originally scheduled determination date No change in or affecting any of the underlier stocks or the method by which the underlier sponsor calculates the underlier Notes purchased on original issue date for the initial issue price noted on the cover page of this pricing supplement and held to the stated maturity date

Moreover, we have not yet set the initial underlier level that will serve as the baseline for determining the underlier return and the amount that we will pay on your notes, if any, at maturity. We will not do so until the trade date. As a result, the actual initial underlier level may differ substantially from the closing level of the underlier prior to the trade date.

For these reasons, the actual performance of the underlier over the term of your notes, as well as the amount payable at maturity, if any, may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical closing levels of the underlier shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement. For information about the historical closing levels of the underlier during recent periods, see “The Underlier—Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier” below. Before investing in the notes, you should consult publicly available information to determine the levels of the underlier between the date of this pricing supplement and the date of your purchase of the notes.

PS- 9

Also, the hypothetical examples shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your notes, tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your notes to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the underlier stocks.

The levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical final underlier levels and are expressed as percentages of the initial underlier level. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical cash settlement amounts, each based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level), and are expressed as percentages of the face amount of a note (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus, a hypothetical cash settlement amount of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would deliver for each $1,000 of the outstanding face amount of the notes on the stated maturity date would equal 100.000% of the face amount of a note, based on the corresponding hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) and the assumptions noted above.

Hypothetical Final Underlier Level

(as Percentage of Initial Underlier Level) Hypothetical Cash Settlement Amount

(as Percentage of Face Amount) 150.000% 110.880% 140.000% 110.880% 130.000% 110.880% 120.000% 110.880% 110.880% 110.880% 110.000% 110.880% 105.000% 110.880% 102.500% 110.880% 100.000% 110.880% 95.000% 110.880% 90.000% 110.880% 87.500% 110.880% 87.499% 99.999% 80.000% 91.429% 75.000% 85.714% 50.000% 57.143% 25.000% 28.571% 0.000% 0.000%

If, for example, the final underlier level were determined to be 25.000% of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be approximately 28.571% of the face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date at the face amount and held them to the stated maturity date, you would lose approximately 71.429% of your investment (if you purchased your notes at a premium to face amount, you would lose a correspondingly higher percentage of your investment). In addition, if the final underlier level were determined to be 87.500% or more of the initial underlier level, the cash settlement amount that we would deliver on your notes at maturity would be limited to the threshold settlement amount, or 110.880% of each $1,000 face amount of your notes, as shown in the table above. As a result, if you purchased your notes on the original issue date and held them to the stated maturity date, you would not receive more than the threshold settlement amount for each $1,000 face amount of your notes, regardless of the extent to which the final underlier level may be greater than 87.500% of the initial underlier level.

The following chart also shows a graphical illustration of the hypothetical cash settlement amounts (expressed as a percentage of the face amount of your notes) that we would pay on your notes on the stated maturity date, if the final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) were any of the hypothetical levels shown on the horizontal axis. The chart shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) of less than 87.500% (the section left of the 87.500% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a hypothetical cash settlement amount of less than 100.000% of the face amount of your notes (the section below the 100.000% marker on the vertical axis) and, accordingly, in a loss of principal to the holder of the notes. The chart also

PS- 10

shows that any hypothetical final underlier level (expressed as a percentage of the initial underlier level) of greater than or equal to 87.500% (the section right of the 87.500% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a capped return on your investment.

The cash settlement amounts shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on closing levels for the underlier that may not be achieved on the determination date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your notes on the stated maturity date or at any other time, including any time you may wish to sell your notes, may bear little relation to the hypothetical cash settlement amounts shown above, and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the notes. The hypothetical cash settlement amounts on notes held to the stated maturity date in the examples above assume you purchased your notes at their face amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual issue price you pay for your notes. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in your notes will be affected by the amount you pay for your notes. If you purchase your notes for a price other than the face amount, the return on your investment will differ from, and may be significantly lower than, the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples.

Please read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes” on page PS-16 of this pricing supplement.

We cannot predict the actual final underlier level or what the market value of your notes will be on any particular trading day, nor can we predict the relationship between the closing level of the underlier and the market value of your notes at any time prior to the stated maturity date. The actual amount that you will receive, if any, at maturity and the rate of return on the notes will depend on the actual initial underlier level, cap level and threshold settlement amount that we will set on the trade date and the actual final underlier level determined by the calculation agent as described above. Moreover, the assumptions on which the hypothetical returns are based may turn out to be inaccurate. Consequently, the amount of cash to be paid in respect of your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date may be very different from the information reflected in the table and chart above.

PS- 11

Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes

An investment in the notes involves significant risks. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors before you invest in the notes. Investing in the notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the underlier or any of the underlier stocks, i.e. the stocks composing the underlier. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

You May Lose Your Entire Investment in the Notes

You can lose your entire investment in the notes. The cash payment on your notes, if any, on the stated maturity date will be based on the performance of the underlier as measured from the initial underlier level set on the trade date to the closing level of the underlier on the determination date (also referred to as the “final underlier level”). If the final underlier level is less than the threshold level, you will lose approximately 1.1429% of the face amount of your notes for every 1% that the final underlier level is less than the threshold level. Thus, you may lose your entire investment in the notes, which would include any premium to face amount you paid when you purchased the notes.

Also, the market price of your notes prior to the stated maturity date may be significantly lower than the purchase price you pay for your notes. Consequently, if you sell your notes before the stated maturity date, you may receive far less than the amount of your investment in the notes.

Your Maximum Payment on the Notes Is Limited to the Threshold Settlement Amount

Your ability to participate in any change in the value of the underlier over the term of your notes will be limited because of the maximum settlement amount (which is equal to the threshold settlement amount), which will be set on the trade date. The maximum settlement amount will limit the cash settlement amount you may receive for each of your notes at maturity, no matter how much the level of the underlier may rise beyond the initial underlier level over the term of your notes. Accordingly, the amount payable for each of your notes may be significantly less than it would have been had you invested directly in the underlier.

If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Face Amount, the Return on Your Investment Will Be Lower Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Face Amount or a Discount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will Be Negatively Affected

The cash settlement amount will not be adjusted based on the issue price you pay for the notes. If you purchase notes at a price that differs from the face amount of the notes, then the return on your investment in such notes held to the stated maturity date will differ from, and may be substantially less than, the return on notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount. If you purchase your notes at a premium to face amount and hold them to the stated maturity date, the return on your investment in the notes will be lower than it would have been had you purchased the notes at face amount or a discount to face amount. In addition, the impact of the threshold level and the cap level on the return on your investment will depend upon the price you pay for your notes relative to face amount. For example, while the threshold level will still provide for an increase in the return on the notes if the final underlier level is greater than or equal to the threshold level but less than the cap level, if the final underlier level is less than the threshold level you will incur a greater percentage decrease in your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount. Similarly, if you purchase your notes at a premium to face amount, the cap level will only permit a lower return on your investment in the notes than would have been the case for notes purchased at face amount or a discount to face amount.

PS- 12

The Stated Maturity Date of the Notes Is a Pricing Term and Will Be Determined By Us on the Trade Date

We will not fix the stated maturity date until the trade date. The term of the notes could be as long as the high end of the range set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. You should be willing and able to hold your notes for up to the high end of the range set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. The stated maturity date selected by us could have an impact on the value of the notes.

Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Levels of the Underlier on the Dates Specified

Any payment on the notes will be determined based on the closing levels of the underlier on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable value of the underlier determined at any other time.

No Interest or Dividend Payments or Voting Rights or Rights to Receive Any Underlier Stock

As a holder of the notes, you will not receive interest payments. As a result, even if the amount payable on the stated maturity date exceeds the face amount of your notes, the overall return you earn on your notes may be less than you would have earned by investing in a non-index-linked debt security of comparable maturity that bears interest at a prevailing market rate. In addition, as a holder of the notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the underlier stocks would have. Furthermore, investing in the notes will not make you a holder of any of the underlier stocks. Your notes will be paid in cash and you will have no right to receive delivery of any underlier stocks.

The U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain

There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the notes, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the IRS. Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the notes are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the notes as prepaid forward contracts, as described above under “Key Terms—Tax consequences.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the notes, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the notes could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the notes (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

Credit of Issuer

The notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the notes and, in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you might not receive any amount owed to you under the terms of the notes.

PS- 13

You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the notes), by acquiring the notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the notes or receiving a different security from the notes, which may be worth significantly less than the notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underlier

Adjustments to the Underlier Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes

The underlier sponsor may add, delete, substitute or adjust the underlier stocks or make other methodological changes to the underlier that could affect its performance. The calculation agent will calculate the value to be used as the closing level of the underlier in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to the underlier. In addition, the underlier sponsor may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of the underlier at any time. Under these circumstances, the calculation agent may select a successor index that the calculation agent determines to be comparable to the underlier or, if no successor index is available, the calculation agent will determine the value to be used as the closing level of the underlier. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the underlier and, consequently, the value of the notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” on page S-91 of the accompanying prospectus supplement, as modified by “Supplemental Terms of the Notes” above.

No Direct Exposure to Fluctuations in Exchange Rates Between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro

The underlier is composed of non-U.S. securities denominated in euros. Because the level of the underlier is also calculated in euros (and not in U.S. dollars), the performance of the underlier will not be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the euro. In addition, any payments on the notes determined based on the performance of the underlier will not be adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the euro. Therefore, holders of the notes will not benefit from any appreciation of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar.

Non-U.S. Securities Markets Risks

The underlier stocks are issued by non-U.S. companies in non-U.S. securities markets. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the notes, involve risks associated with the securities markets in the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities, including risks of volatility in those markets, governmental intervention in those markets and cross shareholdings in companies in certain countries. Also, there is generally less publicly available

PS- 14

information about companies in some of these jurisdictions than there is about U.S. companies that are subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC, and generally non-U.S. companies are subject to accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements and securities trading rules different from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

We and Our Affiliates, and Any Dealer Participating in the Distribution of the Notes, May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect Your Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest

We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the underlier or its components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

Furthermore, if any dealer participating in the distribution of the notes or any of its affiliates conducts hedging activities for us in connection with the notes, that participating dealer or its affiliates will expect to realize a projected profit from such hedging activities, and this projected profit will be in addition to any selling concession that the participating dealer realizes for the sale of the notes to you. This additional projected profit may create a further incentive for the participating dealer to sell the notes to you.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the calculation agent for the notes. As calculation agent, we will determine any values of the underlier and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underlier” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

Lack of Liquidity

The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell

PS- 15

the notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the notes. The notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be willing and able to hold your notes to maturity.

Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes

In addition to the level of the underlier, the value of the notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that may either offset or magnify each other, including: the expected volatility of the underlier; the time to maturity of the notes; the dividend rates on the underlier stocks; exchange rates; interest and yield rates in the market generally; supply and demand for the notes; a variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events; and our creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Expected to Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your notes and the estimated value of the notes is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the notes. These other costs will include a fee paid to iCapital Markets LLC, an electronic platform in which an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, who is acting as a dealer in connection with the distribution of the notes, holds an indirect minority equity interest, for services it is providing in connection with this offering.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions

The estimated value of your notes on the trade date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions that may be purchasers or sellers of notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes

The estimated value of the notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you

PS- 16

may be able to sell your notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions (described above under “Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of Your Notes”), and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the notes, secondary market prices of your notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your notes, and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.

The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market and the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements at All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the trade date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the notes on the trade date, as well as the secondary market value of the notes, for a temporary period after the initial issue date of the notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your notes.

PS- 17

The Underlier

The underlier is a free float market capitalization-weighted index composed of 50 of the largest stocks in terms of free float market capitalization traded on major Eurozone exchanges. For more information about the underlier, see “Indices—The STOXX Benchmark Indices” in the accompanying underlying supplement.

In addition, information about the underlier may be obtained from other sources, including, but not limited to, the underlier sponsor’s website (including information regarding the underlier’s sector weightings). We are not incorporating by reference into this pricing supplement the website or any material it includes. Neither we nor any agent or dealer for this offering makes any representation that this publicly available information regarding the underlier is accurate or complete.

Historical Closing Levels of the Underlier

You should not take the historical levels of the underlier as an indication of the future performance of the underlier. The closing level of the underlier has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. Any historical upward or downward trend in the closing level of the underlier during any period shown below is not an indication that the underlier is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time during the term of your notes. We cannot give you any assurance that the future performance of the underlier or the underlier stocks will not result in a loss on your initial investment on the stated maturity date.

Neither we nor any of our affiliates make any representation to you as to the performance of the underlier. The actual performance of the underlier over the term of the notes, as well as the cash settlement amount, may bear little relation to the historical levels shown below.

The following graph sets forth the historical performance of the underlier based on the daily closing levels from January 4, 2021 through January 23, 2026. The closing level of the underlier on January 23, 2026 was 5,948.20. The dotted line indicates a hypothetical buffer level of 87.50% of the closing level of the underlier on January 23, 2026. The actual buffer level will be equal to 87.50% of the initial underlier level.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-26 17:01:28.340624

And last year, federal agents detained 475 people during a raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.
Here's what we know about immigration enforcement in businesses.
And so can law enforcement agents — without a warrant,” said Jessie Hahn, senior counsel for labor and employment policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy nonprofit.
Still, she stressed the importance of speaking publicly about the impacts of immigration enforcement overall.","From family-run cafes to retail giants, businesses are increasingly coming into the crosshairs of President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign, whether it's public pressure for them to speak out against aggressive immigration enforcement or becoming the sites for such arrests themselves.

In Minneapolis, where the Department of Homeland Security says it's carrying out its largest operation ever, hotels, restaurants and other businesses have temporarily closed their doors or stopped accepting reservations amid widespread protests.

On Sunday, after the U.S. Border Patrol shot and killed Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, more than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies including Target, Best Buy and UnitedHealth signed an open letter calling for ""an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions.""

Still, that letter didn't name immigration enforcement directly, or point to recent arrests at businesses. Earlier this month, widely-circulated videos showed federal agents detaining two Target employees in Minnesota. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has rounded up day laborers in Home Depot parking lots and delivery workers on the street nationwide. And last year, federal agents detained 475 people during a raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia.

Here's what we know about immigration enforcement in businesses.

What ICE is allowed to do

Anyone — including ICE — can enter public areas of a business as they wish. This can include restaurant dining sections, open parking lots, office lobbies and shopping aisles.

“The general public can go into a store for purposes of shopping, right? And so can law enforcement agents — without a warrant,” said Jessie Hahn, senior counsel for labor and employment policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy nonprofit. As a result, immigration officials may try to question people, seize information and even make arrests in public-facing parts of a business.

But to enter areas with a reasonable expectation of privacy — like a back office or a closed-off kitchen — ICE is supposed to have a judicial warrant, which must be signed by a judge from a specified court, and can be limited to certain days or parts of the business.

Judicial warrants should not be confused with administrative warrants, which are signed by immigration officers.

But in an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press, ICE leadership stated administrative warrants were sufficient for federal officers to forcibly enter people's homes if there's a final order of removal. Hahn and other immigration rights lawyers say this upends years of precedent for federal agents' authority in private spaces — and violates ""bedrock principles"" of the U.S. Constitution.

Still, the easiest way for ICE to enter private spaces in businesses without a warrant is through consent from an employer, which could be as simple as letting an agent into certain parts of the property. The agency may also cite other “exigent circumstances,” Hahn notes, such as if they’re in “hot pursuit” of a certain individual.

Other actions ICE can take against employers

Beyond more sweeping workplace raids, enforcement against employers can also take the form of I-9 audits, which focus on verifying employees' authorization to work in the U.S.

Since the start of Trump’s second term, attorneys have pointed to an uptick in instances of ICE physically showing up to a place of business to initiate an I-9 audit. ICE has the authority to do this — but it marks a shift from prior enforcement, when audits more often began through writing like mailed notices.

David Jones, a regional managing partner at labor and employment law firm Fisher Phillips in Memphis, said he's also seen immigration agents approach these audits with the same approach as recent raids.

“ICE is still showing up in their full tactical gear without identifying themselves necessarily, just to do things like serve a notice of inspection,” Jones said. Employers have three days to respond to an I-9 audit, but agents behaving aggressively might make some businesses think they need to act more immediately.

The rights of businesses

If ICE shows up without a warrant, businesses can ask agents to leave — or potentially refuse service based on their own company policy, perhaps citing safety concerns or other disruptions caused by agents' presence. But there's no guarantee immigration officials will comply, especially in public spaces.

“That’s not what we’re seeing here in Minnesota. What we’re seeing is they still conduct the activity,” said John Medeiros, who leads corporate immigration practice at Minneapolis-based law firm Nilan Johnson Lewis.

Because of this, Medeiros said, the question for many businesses becomes less about getting ICE to leave their property and more about what to do if ICE violates consent and other legal requirements.

In Minneapolis — and other cities that have seen immigration enforcement surges, including Chicago and Los Angeles — some businesses have put up signs to label private spaces and set wider protocols for what to do when ICE arrives.

Vanessa Matsis-McCready, associate general counsel and vice president of HR at Engage PEO, says she's also seen a nationwide uptick in interest for I-9 self-audits across sectors and additional emergency preparation.

How the public is responding

ICE's increased presence and forceful arrests at businesses has sparked public outcry, some of it directed at the companies themselves for not taking a strong enough stand.

Some employers, particularly smaller business owners, are speaking out about ICE's impacts on their workers and customers. But a handful of bigger corporations have stayed largely silent, at least publicly, about enforcement making its way to their storefronts.

Minneapolis-based Target has not commented on videos of federal agents detaining two of its employees earlier this month — although its incoming chief executive, Michael Fiddelke, sent a video message to the company's over 400,000 workers Monday calling recent violence ""incredibly painful,"" without directly mentioning immigration enforcement. He said Target was doing ""everything we can to manage what's in our control."" Fiddelke also signed the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce's letter calling for broader de-escalation, which got support from the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group of CEOs from more than 200 companies.

Target is among companies that organizers with ""ICE Out of Minnesota"" have asked to take stronger public stances over ICE's presence in the state. Others include Home Depot, whose parking lots have become a known site of ICE raids over the last year, and Hilton, which protestors said was among brands of Twin City-area hotels that have housed federal agents.

Hilton and Home Depot didn't respond to comment requests over the activists' calls. Home Depot previously denied being involved in immigration operations.

Several worker groups have been more outspoken. Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for a chapter of the Culinary Union in Las Vegas, said members were shocked by a “widening pattern of unlawful ICE behavior” and “recognize that anti-immigrant policies hurt tourism, business, and their families.” United Auto Workers also expressed solidarity with Minneapolis residents ""fighting back against the federal government’s abuses and attacks on the working class.”

Hahn of the National Immigration Law Center noted some businesses are communicating through industry associations to avoid direct exposure to possible retaliation. Still, she stressed the importance of speaking publicly about the impacts of immigration enforcement overall.

“We know that the raids are contributing to things like labor shortages and reduced foot traffic,” Hahn said, adding that fears to push back on “this abuse of power from Trump could ultimately land us in a very different looking economy.”

For those considering Zepbound without insurance coverage, the 'Zepbound Self Pay Journey Program' offers a structured approach to managing the costs. This program, launched by Eli Lilly, aims to make this treatment more accessible to a wider range of patients who are facing the significant financial hurdles often associated with these groundbreaking therapies.

What does this 'journey' actually entail in terms of pricing? Well, Eli Lilly has recently made some notable adjustments to the program's pricing structure, a move designed to improve affordability. For instance, the starting dose of 2.5 mg is now available through LillyDirect, Eli Lilly's own online platform, for $299 per month. This is a reduction from the previous $349. For higher doses, the monthly average price has also seen a decrease, with the 5 mg dose dropping from $499 to $399, and even higher doses moving from $499 down to $449 per month. These adjustments are part of a broader effort by Eli Lilly to address the cost barriers that many patients encounter, as highlighted by their executives.

It's worth noting that the cost of tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound, can vary quite a bit. Without insurance, out-of-pocket costs can typically range from $300 to $600 per month, and this doesn't always include potential clinic membership fees, which can add another $40 to $100. This is where programs like Eli Lilly's become particularly relevant. They aim to provide a more predictable and potentially lower cost for those paying directly.

Beyond the brand-name medication and its specific programs, there's also the realm of compounded tirzepatide. While this can sometimes appear more affordable, it's crucial to approach it with caution. Compounded versions aren't FDA-approved, meaning their safety, quality, and potency aren't guaranteed in the same way as the name-brand drug. The FDA's temporary allowance for compounded GLP-1s has ended, and while some pharmacies can compound under specific regulations, it's still not the same as an approved medication. Prices for compounded versions can swing wildly, from under $100 to over $500, but extremely low prices should raise a red flag, as they could indicate unregulated sources. A more realistic price for compounded tirzepatide, when obtained through legitimate channels, is often in the $299-$399 range per month.

Ultimately, the 'Zepbound Self Pay Journey Program' represents Eli Lilly's commitment to enhancing access to their weight management treatment. It's a step towards making the financial aspect of this journey more manageable for patients who are navigating their health and wellness without the benefit of insurance coverage for these specific medications. Understanding these pricing structures and programs is a key part of making informed decisions about treatment.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-26 15:09:45.433234

It also includes the recently announced Avvance developer experience that enables clients to embed point-of-sale financing directly into their platforms.
“The U.S. Bank Developer Assistant is more than just a tool — it’s a catalyst for efficiency and growth,” said Bhatt.
“By making integration easier, faster and more reliable, the bank is helping clients stay ahead in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.”","Further empowering clients

The Developer Assistant is available to companies that are current or future clients of U.S. Bank and is part of the Developer Portal, an externally facing web experience for developer customers to access API documentation and integrate with U.S. Bank solutions.

With instant technical help, documentation and integration guidance, the Developer Assistant provides more self-sufficiency.

Offering smarter, advanced recommendations for APIs and code, this tool not only improves the developer experience but also reduces errors and increases the adoption of multiple APIs. It promotes best practices like account tokenization and validation, helping ensure that integrations are both secure and effective.

Laying the building blocks

The Developer Portal, which houses the Developer Assistant, was created in 2019 and updated in 2022 to support multiple branded portals – U.S. Bank, Elavon and Elan – from a single code base. As part of this work, the portal expanded beyond documentation to create self-service tools and implementation tracking to reduce onboarding times and enable program growth – helping facilitate hundreds of partnership opportunities.

In 2024, the Developer Portal was awarded Best Findability of Products in a Devportal by the Devportal Awards organization. It has been a hit with the bank’s partner developer community as well. Last year, the portal had 20,000-plus unique visitors and more than 149,000 sessions. It also includes the recently announced Avvance developer experience that enables clients to embed point-of-sale financing directly into their platforms.

Continuing to innovate

Collaborations through the portal support seamless and secure integration of banking capabilities for clients nationwide. The introduction of the Developer Assistant makes the experience even better.

According to a statement from the WCAA, authorities also arrested the driver but still had yet to determine the cause of the crash.
The Detroit Free Press reports that several videos posted on social media appear to show a man wearing a Detroit Lions jersey being taken into custody, but it can't confirm whether he was the driver who crashed into the airport.
Why didn't the Detroit airport have bollards in place to prevent a car from crashing into the terminal?
It's entirely possible there's a reason, but that also seems like pretty basic airport security stuff.","Air travel can be incredibly stressful, and it's understandable that you might get frustrated, but no matter how close you are to missing your flight, Jalopnik's official position is that you should not crash your car into the airport. Sure, you might be tempted, but you should resist that temptation. We'd also like to think that would be obvious, but ClickOnDetroit reports someone did exactly that on Friday night at the Detroit airport.

While airports usually place bollards to prevent something like this from happening, the driver reportedly crashed through the front doors and into the area that Delta Air Lines uses for check-ins and bag checks. Thankfully, the driver didn't kill anyone when they crashed their car into the airport, but the Wayne County Airport Authority did say in a statement that the fire department treated six people at the scene of the crash. According to a statement from the WCAA, authorities also arrested the driver but still had yet to determine the cause of the crash.

Even though the crash happened several days ago, information remains limited. The Detroit Free Press reports that several videos posted on social media appear to show a man wearing a Detroit Lions jersey being taken into custody, but it can't confirm whether he was the driver who crashed into the airport. Hopefully, we'll learn more in the next couple of days.

Initial reports also described the driver's car as a Mercedes-Benz S-Class, but upon closer inspection, it appears to instead be a much less expensive C-Class. In fact, I'm pretty sure it isn't even a particularly fancy C-Class and would be willing to bet it's nothing more than a C300. If you're scrambling to escape a car crashing into the building you assumed you'd be safe inside, that probably doesn't matter to you all that much, at least in the moment, but as a transportation site, it's still important for us to point out. The facts matter, you know?

Also, while I can't imagine anyone at Mercedes is thrilled to see one of its cars in the news after someone drove it into an airport, on a certain level, you have to imagine the design team is pleased a C-Class got confused with an S-Class. After all, that's the whole reason the C-Class looks like a smaller S-Class, right? Same sausage, different length? It's not like a car with a roughly $40,000 base price could ever be considered cheap, but at the time, a new S-Class cost more than twice as much as a base C-Class, and people don't usually confuse a $40,000 car with one that cost more than $90,000 when it was new.

Still, that's far from the biggest issue here. Why didn't the Detroit airport have bollards in place to prevent a car from crashing into the terminal? It's entirely possible there's a reason, but that also seems like pretty basic airport security stuff. Whether this was an intentional attack, or the driver simply experienced a medical emergency, you'd think there would be measures in place to stop something like this from happening.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/crashing-out-at-the-detroit-airport-is-understandable-but-actually-crashing-into-it-is-still-inadvisable/l-intro-1769444644.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 18:02:26.072487

It said lending will be drawn from banks’ balance sheets and will primarily target smaller enterprises.
The banks and UKEF have also agreed to provide advisory support to borrowers.
UK business secretary Peter Kyle, who convened today’s discussion, said: “Strengthening Britain’s export potential relies on British businesses having the means, motive, and opportunity to succeed in new overseas markets.
In 2024, UKEF announced it planned to support 1,000 SMEs per year by 2029, up from just over 200 across the previous financial year.","UK Export Finance (UKEF) will grant automatic guarantees to working capital facilities provided by Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest and Santander, as part of an £11bn lending package targeting British SMEs.

The UK government announced today that following talks in Westminster, the five lenders, which collectively serve half of all British businesses, agreed to a funding commitment aimed at helping companies expand into international markets and benefit from new trade deals.

It said lending will be drawn from banks’ balance sheets and will primarily target smaller enterprises. The banks and UKEF have also agreed to provide advisory support to borrowers.

UKEF will provide guarantees of up to 80% for eligible loans, and banks can apply the cover automatically for working capital facilities up to £10mn in value.

The government said the agreement “is one of the largest collective moves by the banking sector in over a decade”.

HSBC, which has pledged to make £3bn in lending available through the scheme, said its research shows that 82% of businesses that trade internationally expect to grow over the next two years.

“Yet many face barriers to accessing the capital and support they need to go global,” the bank said.

UK business secretary Peter Kyle, who convened today’s discussion, said: “Strengthening Britain’s export potential relies on British businesses having the means, motive, and opportunity to succeed in new overseas markets.

“The £11bn these banks are making available will help meet the ambitions of smaller British businesses to fully export, expand and exploit these international market opportunities.”

UKEF chief executive Tim Reid added the agreement “unlocks billions of pounds to help UK businesses compete to win overseas contracts”.

The announcement follows last year’s move by Westminster to increase UKEF’s capacity by £20bn, bringing its lending and guarantee limit to £80bn, part of the government’s first trade strategy since leaving the EU in 2020.

In 2024, UKEF announced it planned to support 1,000 SMEs per year by 2029, up from just over 200 across the previous financial year.

John Baldwin, chief executive of Santander’s corporate and commercial banking division, said the bank’s most recent Trade Barometer, its bi-annual research study, found UK businesses have “an ever-growing interest in international expansion – despite the various geopolitical challenges they face”.

“I’m proud to have worked with UKEF on the lending packages announced today, which will help power the overseas growth ambitions of businesses across the UK – and in turn boost the UK economy,” he said.",https://www.gtreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Felixstowe-port_resized.jpeg,N,,2026-01-26 15:09:40.055012

The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.

An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Similarly, Anthropic is on the verge of being given a $350 billion price tag as it happily raises $10 billion or more.
While public markets might raise eyebrows, none of this uncertainty is putting off the private markets.
At least until OpenAI or Anthropic decide they want public-market money badly enough to tolerate public-market questions.","Yet launching on to the AI-thirsty equity markets is not yet necessary for the makers of ChatGPT and Claude, because the cash continues to gush into them with the intensity of a firehose.

OpenAI was valued at $500 billion in October after an employee share sale saw investment by Softbank and Abu Dhabi’s MGX. Just last month, the chatter was that OpenAI was in another round of talks to raise another $100 billion which would value it at $750 billion. Similarly, Anthropic is on the verge of being given a $350 billion price tag as it happily raises $10 billion or more.

These businesses still have far too many unanswered questions to go public. Staying private keeps a comfortable cloak of secrecy over their operations and gives them time to unpick their devilishly complex corporate structures.

Being a listed business would require an unprecedented level of transparency, not least over whether their revenues can catch up with their spending.

Sure, they are growing at a rate of knots, but we are not quite sure at what cost. Anthropic’s revenues doubled from $4 billion to $9 billion last year. OpenAI’s annualised revenues (what the company is earning right now, scaled up as if that pace continued for a full year) rose above $20 billion in 2025, up from $6 billion in 2024.

Yet the mammoth outgoings on computing capacity dwarfs sales, and they need to keep spending because bigger models create more user demand and support more paying customers.

While public markets might raise eyebrows, none of this uncertainty is putting off the private markets. Asked by Brad Gerstner, his own investor, how OpenAI could commit to spending trillions while earning merely billions, Sam Altman, OpenAI’s chief executive, shut him down with sharp confidence.

“If you want to sell your shares, I’ll find you a buyer,” Altman snapped on the BG2 Pod. Who needs retail shareholders when private buyers are baying for equity?

• Will AI bubble trouble the stock markets in 2026?

A listing would mean the grind of quarterly reporting, exposing their detailed financials or as OpenAI’s chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, called it, getting “wrapped around an IPO axle”.

Unlike their private British counterparts who make annual filings with Companies House, the Americans need to reveal very little of what goes on beneath the bonnet to anyone, except their leading investors.

Perhaps more crucially, a float would mean revealing the details of the complex circular deals which have raised the spectre of the dotcom boom and bust. It would provide an answer to that well-worn question “are we in a bubble?” and it may not be an answer they want to give.

There’s a nervousness about being the first mover and suffering a spectacular flop. Then there’s the force majeure. The US federal government shutdown last year hurt IPOs as the administrative machine stalled while President Trump’s erratic behaviour is churning up the markets.

In the meantime, anyone keen to get exposure to these shares can do it the long way round, by buying into their heavyweight partners, Amazon or Microsoft. At least until OpenAI or Anthropic decide they want public-market money badly enough to tolerate public-market questions. Right now, that feels some way off.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Ff2a96e27-320f-4e9b-960b-a3765bc3efc8.jpg?crop=1500%2C844%2C0%2C78&resize=1200,N,,2026-01-26 13:03:27.556895

CEOs of more than 60 Minnesota-based organizations released a joint statement Sunday, through the state’s Chamber of Commerce, urging “immediate de-escalation of tensions” that have plagued Minneapolis for weeks amid the flood of Immigration & Customs Enforcement actions in the city. Tensions soared in the wake of the Jan. 6 killing of legal observer Renee Nicole Good by an ICE officer, with many fearing more escalation after Saturday’s shooting death of ICU nurse Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol agent.

The CEOs took a neutral tone in their letter, referencing how the “recent challenges facing our state have created widespread disruption and tragic loss of life.” But they urged definite action, including better collaboration among local, state and federal officials to find “real solutions.”

Pressure from employees is building

The coalition includes some of the state’s largest employers, such as Target, Cargill, 3M, Medtronic, Land O’ Lakes, United Health Group, Delta Dental and General Mills.

While the letter came on the heels of Pretti’s death, it also followed increasing pressure from employees for leadership to take a stand on ICE and the Trump administration’s targeting of Minneapolis.

Organizers of the Jan. 23 “ICE out of Minnesota” action say more than 75,000 residents walked out of work and school—and 700 businesses closed down—to take part in a march calling for the agency to vacate the state. Hundreds of Target workers issued a letter before the protest to the company CEO, urging the organization to take a stance.

Hilton has also found itself under intense scrutiny after one of its Minneapolis-area franchisees cancelled the reservations of a group of ICE officers. The chain severed ties with the property, prompting protests at its locations across Minneapolis and elsewhere.

The growing backlash, including from employees, mirrors the calls for organizations to speak out in the wake of the 2020 murder of George Floyd. That pressure led to significant growth in corporate DEI investments and agendas, much of which has abated in the last few years.

“The message to those most affected was clear: When the news cycle moves on, so do you,” Dr. Marcelle Moncrieffe-Newman recently wrote for HR Executive about DEI rollbacks.

Yet, many workers, particularly Gen Z, expect their employer to be unequivocal about cultural issues, including hot-button political topics.

A survey from Bentley University and Gallup last year found that 51% of Americans want companies to take a public stance on current events—a 13-point jump from 2024. In particular, 41% of those surveyed believe organizations should speak out on immigration, and 58% want to see companies comment on free speech issues—both 10 points higher than the previous year.

In an interview with The New York Times about the Minnesota CEO letter, New York University Professor Alison Taylor said the companies have been “backed into a corner.”

“Because obviously the situation going on is starting to have commercial consequences,” she said, noting, however, that the letter—which does not express outright opposition to ICE or tactics being used in Minneapolis—is likely going to draw criticism. Commentary in Axios has already labeled the effort “milquetoast.”

“Is it better than doing nothing?” Taylor questioned. “Probably. Is it sufficient? I don’t think anyone’s going to think this is sufficient.”

Calling for cooperation

While the CEOs’ open letter struck a neutral tone, it did suggest leaders are involved—albeit in a less visible way—in efforts to reduce the potential for further conflict. They wrote that representatives of the coalition have been working “every day behind the scenes” with local, state and federal officials, including remaining in “close communication” with Minn. Gov. Tim Walz, the White House, Vice President J.D. Vance and local mayors.

“There are ways for us to come together to foster progress,” they wrote, calling for “peace and focused cooperation” among leaders to achieve a “swift and durable solution that enables families, business, our employees and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future.”",https://hrexecutive.com/wp-content/uploads/Immigration-Enforcement-Minnesota-2-AP-Photo-Adam-Gray-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:03:18.278572

Hours before I slid into Celine’s presentation on Saturday, a designer who had already seen the clothes relayed to me that Mr. Rider’s first full men’s collection for Celine was cunning, inviting, good. He was right.

On the wall at Celine HQ were outfits rigged up by Mr. Rider. What stood out? An ivory field jacket with sleeves in a slightly different shade of cream, a navy half-zip with a key holder looped onto the zipper and a collarless overcoat that landed at the knees, like a Bar jacket that underwent limb-lengthening surgery.

I lingered over a black wool jacket, the offspring of a sport coat and a Harrington. It was dressy with roped shoulders, yet chopped straight across. I wanted to grab it off the wall and try it on, to feel its swing. I was less sold on the white jeans it was styled with. Great in theory, thorny to pull off. Ditto the ballet plimsolls, which looked too lithe for the cobblestones in the courtyard below.

Mr. Rider is making something fresh at Celine. It can’t be lumped in with the masses of vintage-ripping collections I’ve seen in Paris this week. It’s winky but wearable. Or in Mr. Rider’s words from the press notes: “Classics with bite.”

The distribution expands the algorithm’s accessibility to AWS users, providing a direct software-to-hardware pathway for industrial chemistry applications. HI-VQE is designed to execute on multiple quantum modalities available through Braket, including trapped-ion, superconducting, and neutral-atom processors from IonQ, IQM, QuEra, AQT, and Rigetti.

The HI-VQE algorithm utilizes a hybrid quantum-classical architecture specifically optimized for the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Unlike traditional VQE methods that rely on extensive Pauli word measurements—which often introduce significant overhead—Qunova’s “Handover” iteration reduces resource demands by simplifying the quantum-to-classical data transfer. This mechanism allows for molecular modeling and material reaction simulations to achieve “chemical accuracy” with fewer quantum resources, reportedly improving computational efficiency by several orders of magnitude compared to standard variational solvers.

The algorithm is strictly hardware-agnostic and has been validated on various quantum systems with scales reaching up to 56 qubits. By offering the tool via a cloud-native marketplace, Qunova aims to remove integration barriers for enterprises in the pharmaceutical, petrochemical, and materials science sectors. The platform supports multiple commercial models, including pay-as-you-go, annual subscriptions, and custom short-term project plans, intended to fit standard industrial R&D workflows.

The AWS launch follows the algorithm’s 2025 debut on the IBM Qiskit Functions catalog, marking a second major cloud distribution milestone. Qunova has also introduced a secondary optimization algorithm capable of handling up to 100,000 combinatorial variables on current NISQ hardware. These developments are precursors to a planned demonstration of “Industrial Quantum Advantage” scheduled for February 2026, which intends to show quantum-enhanced precision for computational chemistry tasks that are currently intractable for classical-only high-performance computing (HPC) systems.

The Maia 200 comes as major cloud computing firms such as Microsoft, Alphabet's Google and Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services - some of Nvidia's biggest customers - are producing their own chips that increasingly compete with Nvidia.

Google, in particular, has garnered interest from major Nvidia customers such as Meta Platforms, which is working closely with Google to close one of the biggest software gaps between Google and Nvidia's AI chip offerings.

For its part, Microsoft said that along with the new Maia chip, it will be offering a package of software tools to program it. That includes Triton, an open-source software tool with major contributions from ChatGPT creator OpenAI that takes on the same tasks as Cuda, the Nvidia software that many Wall Street analysts say is Nvidia's biggest competitive advantage.

But Microsoft has also taken a page from the playbook of some of Nvidia's rising competitors by packing the Maia 200 chip with a significant amount of what is known as SRAM, a type of memory that can provide speed advantages for chatbots and other AI systems when they field requests from a large number of users.

Cerebras Systems, which recently inked a $10 billion deal with OpenAI to supply computing power, leans heavily on that technology, as does Groq, the startup that Nvidia licensed technology from in a reported $20 billion deal.

In recent weeks, Medtronic reported multiple milestones for its Affera Sphere-360 pulsed field ablation catheter, including CE Mark approval in Europe and completion of first procedures in the U.S. Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial for treating paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

This progress highlights Medtronic’s push to integrate an all-in-one mapping and rotation-free ablation approach, potentially improving procedure efficiency and reinforcing its position in cardiac rhythm management.

We’ll now examine how this advancement in pulsed field ablation technology shapes Medtronic’s broader investment narrative and future growth priorities.

What Is Medtronic's Investment Narrative?

For Medtronic, you really have to buy into a story of steady, innovation-led growth backed by dependable cash returns. The company is already executing on mid single-digit revenue expansion and earnings growth in the high single digits, while funding a rising dividend and ongoing buybacks. The latest Affera Sphere-360 pulsed field ablation milestones fit neatly into that narrative as a potential medium-term growth driver in cardiac rhythm management, but probably do not change the near-term earnings catalysts that investors are watching, such as upcoming results and margin progress in diabetes and cardiovascular. More incrementally important, the MiniMed Go clearance and the Anteris and Precision Neuroscience deals underscore Medtronic’s push into higher-tech adjacencies, which can support its competitive position but also add integration, execution and capital allocation risk at a time when debt levels are already elevated.

However, one risk in particular could matter more than many shareholders might expect. Medtronic's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Ten Simply Wall St Community fair value estimates for Medtronic span roughly US$95 to just over US$110, underscoring how differently investors view the stock. Layer that dispersion over the company’s expanding pipeline in cardiac, diabetes and neurosurgery, and you get very different expectations for how much execution risk is acceptable.

- why the stock might be worth 6% less than the current price!

This commitment is embodied daily by its Corporate Foundation, which is dedicated to promoting equal opportunities and forstering a more inclusive and equitable society.

Why is education central to our mission?

Education is one of the main drivers of equal opportunity. It broadens horizons, enabling everyone to envisage their future and find their place, regardless of their background or personal journey. This is why the Societe Generale Corporate Foundation dedicates more than 50% of its budget to education.

Nearly 70 projects are supported in France and internationally each year. These projects support young people in vulnerable situations by helping them to acquire fundamental skills and financial literacy, and by providing them with opportunities to participate in sports, arts and music. These activities promote education and inclusion, as well as facilitating professional integration into careers related to ecological or digital transitions.

Underpinning all these activities is a shared ambition: to help every young person believe in their potential and build their future.

Fundamental skills: an essential foundation

Mastering the foundamental skills of reading, writing and arithmetic is essential for individual empowerment and social progress. This is why the Foundation supports initiatives led by associations such as 1001 Mots and Coup de Pouce that focus on prevention.

These foundational skills are not just academic; they are also vital for lifelong learning, developing autonomy and critical thinking, and adapting to a constantly changing environment.

In this spirit, Lumières sur l’info, a Foundation partner, offers media literacy workshops and carries out initiatives to combat misinformation and fake news.

Financial education: a pathway to autonomy

Knowing how to manage a budget, understand a contract, and evaluate the consequences of financial decisions is essential for gaining autonomy. However, not all young people have access to this kind of education. Societe Generale supports educational workshops and practical tools alongside associations such as Crésus, designed to help young people better understand daily financial issues and make informed choices.

Music and culture: disciplines of confidence and self-expression

Classical music and modern and contemporary art have long been central to Societe Generale’s cultural commitment. Since 1987, the Group has recognised the educational value of music, believing in its ability to foster skills that extend far beyond artistic practice. For many young people, access to culture and artistic activities can be a powerful driver of empowerment and is sometimes decisive in shaping their personal and professional journeys.

The Foundation supports several initiatives, including the Maîtrise Populaire de l’Opéra-Comique, the DEMOS orchestra led by the Philharmonie de Paris, the Classes Culture at the Musée d’Orsay and the Orchestre à l’École programme. These initiatives offer young people sustained access to challenging musical and cultural opportunities, fostering strong links with local communities and educational institutions.

Sport, a powerful educational and inclusive tool

Through practice and teamwork, it teaches valuable life lessons such as respect for rules, commitment, cooperation, and perseverance. The Societe Generale Foundation supports educational and social inclusion projects through sport, particularly those aimed at young people who are not on traditional pathways. These initiatives provide a structured environment, boost confidence, and open up new opportunities.",https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/image/2026-01/visuelsport-musique-1200x630.png.jpg?itok=y_EwG4XZ,N,,2026-01-26 15:10:04.678748

Nvidia is investing $2 billion in CoreWeave, extending their relationship as energy demand surges to support the buildout of AI data centers.

Key Facts

Key Background

Nvidia has been a major backer of CoreWeave, previously agreeing to buy over $6 billion in services from them, according to a September filing. CoreWeave, which went public in March after raising billions in debt and equity, has rapidly expanded its AI infrastructure, striking deals to supply more than $14 billion in AI cloud capacity to Meta and expanding its agreement with OpenAI to as much as $22.4 billion. Once best known for powering video games and crypto mining, Nvidia’s graphic processing units, GPUs, became a critical engine for artificial intelligence.

“Fortitude is at the forefront of a new era in therapeutic innovation,” said Chen, who serves as the biotech’s CEO.","What do you get when you insert a molecular glue degrader into an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC)? Fortitude Biomedicines is in the process of finding out.

The Waltham, Massachusetts-based biotech is launching with $13 million in seed funds, which are earmarked for the company’s lead preclinical immune cell targeting biologic program. Cash will also be used for GLUE-DAC, a drug discovery engine designed to attach molecular glue degraders as the payload in ADCs.

K2 Bio Partners and Shanghai Healthcare Angel Capital co-led the seed financing, while Elikon Venture, Everjoy Fortune and Taihill Venture also joined.

GLUE-DAC’s origins can be traced back to the Baylor College of Medicine lab of Jin Wang, Ph.D., where he directs the center for next-gen therapeutics. The concept is to “integrate the precision targeting of ADCs with the catalytic power of targeted protein degradation,” Fortitude explained in a Jan. 26 release.

Wang founded Fortitude alongside fellow Baylor Professor Michael DeBakey, M.D., and entrepreneur Jesse Chen, Ph.D., who has previously co-founded both Triana Biomedicines and Avilar Therapeutics.

“Fortitude is at the forefront of a new era in therapeutic innovation,” said Chen, who serves as the biotech’s CEO. “With proprietary antibody-based technology, we are unlocking the ability to precisely target diseases while engaging the body’s own biology in powerful, transformative ways.”

While ADCs like Enhertu are now a key part of the cancer treatment portfolio—and new options continue to attract Big Pharma buyers—the emergence of drug resistance has limited the efficacy of this modality.

Fortitude’s hope is that GLUE-DAC can meet this challenge by combining the validated delivery capabilities of antibodies with what Wang described as the “transformative potential of targeted protein degradation.”

“GLUE-DAC has the potential to expand the therapeutic window of ADCs, overcome resistance mechanisms and unlock new therapeutic targets,” the company explained in this morning’s release.",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-1473569087.jpg?VersionId=crtpsH0hlqBvWi6w3vQ5BICujFJwGCrS,N,,2026-01-26 14:02:17.709721

The Successful Year 2025 CEZ Group also performed well with other international rating agencies last year.
CEZ Group opened its first credit line tied to ESG rating in the summer of 2023, and currently has the opportunity to draw up to CZK 30 billion from six banks under ESG loans.","CEZ Group continues to gradually improve its ESG rating, i.e. the assessment of non-financial criteria related to the environment, social activities and transparent corporate governance. In recent years, investors, banks and insurance companies have been focusing on these types of parameters because they are an important indicator of whether a company’s business is sustainable in the long term. A better ESG score therefore opens the door to, for example, more favourable financing terms or insurance policies.

CEZ Group’s most recent rating success was achieved with the international non-profit CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), which evaluates more than 22,000 companies from 130 countries and whose data is crucial for hundreds of global investors. In the area of combating climate change, CEZ Group jumped three places, from a C to an A- in 2025.

“Producing clean and affordable energy better for the environment and better for people is one of the pillars of our strategy. I’m very happy that renowned foreign organisations appreciate our steps. With an A- score, we can proudly compare ourselves to the best-rated European energy companies,” said Michaela Chaloupková, Member of the Board of Directors and Chief Sustainability Officer at CEZ.

The improvement in the “climate grade” was mainly due to information from the 2024 Sustainability Report, prepared in accordance with the new European standards, and the detailed mapping and description of risks and opportunities in relation to the Clean Energy for Tomorrow strategy. CDP also appreciated the more detailed reporting of indirect emissions from energy consumption.

Last year, CDP also evaluated CEZ in terms of efficient and sustainable management of water resources—in this area, the company received a B score, which is also an improvement up from its last rating of C. The last area evaluated was forest care and protection, where the rating remained unchanged at a C. CEZ meets all the legal requirements in this category, but focuses primarily on the aforementioned areas of climate protection and water management.

The Successful Year 2025

CEZ Group also performed well with other international rating agencies last year. For example, S&P Global, which rates approximately 4,600 global companies, recognised an improvement of 9 points to 62 out of 100.CEZ also maintained its high AA rating with MSCI and saw a slight improvement with Morningstar Sustainalytics last year. According to CSRHub, which evaluates more than 43,000 companies by aggregating ratings from dozens of agencies and organisations into a single parameter, CEZ currently ranks among the top 6% of the best-rated companies in the world (value published in December 2025).

ESG ratings from international rating agencies and clear plans for decarbonisation are important, for example, for banks. CEZ Group opened its first credit line tied to ESG rating in the summer of 2023, and currently has the opportunity to draw up to CZK 30 billion from six banks under ESG loans. Since 2022, CEZ has also implemented a total of four sustainability-linked bond issues (specifically, a GHG emissions intensity target in 2025 or 2030) with a total value of EUR 2.9 billion.",https://www.cez.cz/webpublic/file/edee/2026/01/fve_1.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 14:02:33.584008

What is brelovitug?
A potential biologics license application submission and launch are expected in 2027 and are dependent on trial outcomes.1 “This program fits squarely within our core strengths in rare disease and builds on our deep expertise in rare liver conditions.
We believe Mirum’s global development and commercial synergies position us well to deliver for patients living with HDV,” Peetz said.
What are the financial details of the acquisition?","Mirum Pharmaceuticals announced the completion of its acquisition of Bluejay Therapeutics, adding a late-stage liver disease program to its pipeline and positioning the company for potential entry into the treatment of chronic hepatitis delta virus (HDV), a rare and severe condition with no approved therapies in the United States.1

HDV is a coinfection occurring in select people infected with the hepatitis B virus and is the most severe form of viral hepatitis due to its potential for rapid progression to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver-related death.1 The disease affects an estimated 230,000 people in both the United States and Europe, with estimates suggesting that more than 50% of individuals with HDV will die of liver-related causes within 10 years of diagnosis.1

The transaction brings Mirum the worldwide rights to brelovitug, a monoclonal antibody currently in Phase III development, reflecting Mirum’s strategy to expand within rare liver diseases through assets approaching potential registration.1

Brelovitug is currently undergoing evaluations for the treatment of HDV, and with no approved treatments for HDV in the United States and most countries worldwide, it marks the indication as an area of significant unmet medical need.

“With the acquisition now complete, our focus shifts to execution –adding the talented Bluejay team to Mirum as we complete the AZURE Phase 3 program for HDV and prepare for potential registrations and launches,” said Chris Peetz, chief executive officer of Mirum.

What is brelovitug?

Brelovitug received both Breakthrough Therapy designation from FDA and PRIME designation from the European Medicines Agency, signifying regulatory recognition of its potential based on earlier clinical data.1

Brelovitug is currently undergoing study in the global AZURE Phase III registrational program which is expecting topline data in the second half of 2026.1 The AZURE program consists of multiple open-label studies designed to evaluate a combined virologic and biochemical response, with the primary goal of supporting regulatory submissions in the United States and Europe.

In Phase II studies, brelovitug demonstrated strong antiviral activity in HDV, including a complete HDV RNA response, improvements in liver enzyme levels, and a safety profile characterized primarily by injection-site erythema.1 While Phase III data is expected to determine the drug’s ability to get approved, its existing dataset has continued to support its advancement into registrational studies.

A potential biologics license application submission and launch are expected in 2027 and are dependent on trial outcomes.1

“This program fits squarely within our core strengths in rare disease and builds on our deep expertise in rare liver conditions. We believe Mirum’s global development and commercial synergies position us well to deliver for patients living with HDV,” Peetz said.

What are the financial details of the acquisition?

Per the terms of the acquisition agreement, Mirum is set to acquire all outstanding shares of Bluejay Therapeutics through a combination of cash and Mirum common stock, with the potential for additional tiered sales-based milestone payments.1

In accordance with the acquisition, Mirum has also completed its previously announced private placement financings across both existing and new healthcare investors, generating upwards of $268.5 million in gross proceeds.1 The capital is expected to help support ongoing clinical development and future commercial activities related to brelovitug.

""Trust is a narrative problem first, and a technology problem second,"" added Hugh Taggart, CEO of Weber Shandwick's EMEA region.

Why it matters: Health care AI has the potential to help improve patient outcomes and lower the risk of physician burnout.

Axios' Courtenay Brown moderated the Expert Voices conversation, which was sponsored by Philips.

What they're saying: Trust in health care AI is particularly low, said Vanessa Parli, managing director of programs and external engagement at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI (HAI).

Using the word ""productivity"" about AI can be a deterrent to providers because it may imply less time seeing patients, according to Eric Cioè Peña, Northwell Health vice president and the founding director of its Center for Global Health.

""Trust is a narrative problem first, and a technology problem second,"" added Hugh Taggart, CEO of Weber Shandwick's EMEA region.

By the numbers: A survey from Philips found a gap between providers (63%) and patients (48%) when it came to optimism about AI improving patient outcomes.

Yes, but: Keeping humans in the loop has been key to successful implementation strategies at Mayo Clinic, said Matthew Callstrom, physician lead of AI and strategy at Mayo Clinic.

""When you start to explain to patients how we're using AI, they're like, put me in,"" Callstrom said.

This has helped on the provider side as well, he said. For instance, a volunteer innovation team at Mayo built and tested an AI-driven handoff tool for the transition between nurse shifts. It has since been adopted by 75% of the nurses, generating hundreds of thousands of summaries.

What's next: The industry should ""think about it in terms of what we know, from research, drives trust: accountability [and] transparency,"" American Psychological Association CEO Arthur Evans said.

Anthropic's Claude for Healthcare is ""building connectors to key data sources that we know are trusted, like the CMS coverage database or the National Provider identification registry,"" said Elizabeth Kelly, head of beneficial deployments.

""The systems should be very forthcoming with what they will not do,"" Peloton CTO Francis Shanahan said.

""You need to design [the technology] in a way so that the consumer understands what the implications of the technology are,"" Parli added.

""This expanded collaboration underscores the strength of demand we are seeing across our customer base and the broader market signals as AI systems move into large-scale production,"" CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator said in a statement.

Nvidia was already a major CoreWeave investor, owning about 6.6% of the company's shares outstanding as of the end of September, according to FactSet data.

The latest investment underscores a polarizing aspect of the AI trade. While Nvidia's move could be interpreted as a sign of confidence that the AI era is only just getting started, critics have deemed past moves as examples of ""circular financing,"" taking issue with how Nvidia has become so intertwined with some of its partners.

CoreWeave's stock is up more than 8% in premarket trades on Monday, while Nvidia's stock is down fractionally.

AI literacy and agentic AI fluency enable developers to build, train and manage AI agents that align with business logic and enterprise goals.

But as mainframes move deeper into these hybrid environments, developers cannot just rely on mainframe expertise alone. Integrating AI — especially agentic AI — in mainframe environments before your people and processes are prepared can create or worsen existing problems. A recent report found that even as companies invest in technology and skills to prepare mainframe developers for the future, 35% of those already working with AI on the mainframe say existing skills gaps are hindering progress, underscoring the need for a more multiskilled approach.

Developers need to be on top of the latest rules around AI deployment, build on their existing skills and technical fluency, and develop the confidence to experiment safely as new technologies enter the enterprise landscape.

Like learning to drive, deploying AI on the mainframe requires more than just knowing the mechanics. It takes confidence, real-world practice and trust in the system.

Learning the rules of the road

Enterprise security teams are increasingly concerned about AI-driven threats, which Gartner identifies as the fastest-growing category of attacks. However, governance and compliance efforts have not kept up with the rapid pace of AI development. Limited understanding, low prioritization and gaps in technical oversight are creating significant risks, especially since AI systems depend on sensitive data and continually evolving code. As with any transformative technology, the rules and regulations around AI are evolving, and developers must stay current, especially in regulated environments.

By gaining a better understanding and awareness of the latest information, developers will be able to monitor the mainframe using the latest organizational guardrails designed to protect systems and vulnerable data. Effective guardrails and governance frameworks ensure employees use AI responsibly, helping organizations avoid regulatory breaches, legal exposure, security risks and the financial or reputational damage that can result.

As experienced professionals retire and misconceptions around “legacy” systems persist, organizations face a growing skills gap. Investing in mainframe education isn’t just a technical necessity; it’s a strategic move to safeguard key business applications and infrastructure, ensure continuity and maintain competitiveness in a rapidly evolving landscape.

Security as the seatbelt for AI

As with any major technology shift, security must be a cornerstone of agentic AI adoption. These systems need robust safeguards to ensure safe and reliable operations. One critical measure is role-based access control, which limits agent permissions based on their specific functions, reducing the risk of unauthorized actions. This is reinforced by secure credential storage, encryption and multi-factor authentication to protect both system integrity and user authorization.

Equally important are controls governing how agents interact with data and execute tasks. Techniques such as input validation, output monitoring and behavioral constraints help prevent misuse of language model components, while human oversight for high-impact actions adds an extra layer of protection. Prompt engineering is equally critical, as poorly structured prompts can lead to unpredictable or unsafe actions by AI agents. By applying disciplined prompt design alongside input validation, organizations can ensure that AI-driven processes remain accurate, secure and aligned with business objectives. This ensures that sensitive or disruptive operations are carefully reviewed before execution.

Finally, continuous monitoring, observability and auditing provide transparency and accountability across the lifecycle of agentic systems. These practices strengthen trust and integrity, enabling organizations to deploy AI confidently while maintaining compliance and control.

Driving readiness through core skill integration

To succeed in the AI era, developers need a blend of core and future-ready skills grounded by foundational training. When used responsibly and thoughtfully, AI tools can be used for closing that gap and fast-tracking modernization efforts — provided they are deployed intentionally.

Mainframe fluency anchors AI deployments in deep system knowledge. AI literacy and agentic AI fluency enable developers to build, train and manage AI agents that align with business logic and enterprise goals.

The challenge isn’t a lack of educational resources — there’s an abundance of training available. The real barrier is perception: mainframe skills are often seen as outdated or ‘untrendy.’ Yet these skills remain highly valuable. In fact, specialized expertise in areas like COBOL often commands higher salaries than more common languages such as Java because qualified professionals are in short supply.

A study by the Futurum Group revealed that while educational institutions are producing more mainframe-trained graduates, 61% of the respondents still report a significant skills gap between what’s taught and what’s needed in practice. Showing the need for continued skill integration, and not just foundational training.

Confidence behind the wheel

In the same way drivers can know the rules of the road, without confidence out on the road, they are just as much at risk. The same goes for developers dealing with deploying a new technology like AI.

Mentorship, simulation tools and community learning can all help close the confidence gap, by giving mainframe developers safe-play zones where they can explore AI deployments without fear of impacting production.

Organizations can be critical enablers by creating the infrastructure and culture that support experimentation and skill growth. Building confidence is just as vital as building a strong skillset; both are necessary to move beyond cautious pilots to confident production-scale deployments.

Driving isn’t just about moving forward, it’s about being prepared for the unexpected, knowing when to accelerate and trusting your tools.

The rise of AI isn’t just about automating tasks, it’s about empowering people to engage with systems they once found intimidating. For many, mainframe modernization has been slowed not by lack of vision but by a lack of confidence, uncertainty around where to start, what might break or how to fill gaps left by retiring experts. But when AI agents become part of daily workflows, that fear starts to fade. Developers begin to trust their footing. And teams start making decisions with clarity instead of caution.",https://www.cio.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/4121590-0-87822200-1769428943-shutterstock_2671163531.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2026-01-26 11:06:11.286735

Steve Wylie, vice president and general manager, Northeast, for Cisco partner Trace3, is “excited” for the launch of Cisco 360.
Cisco first unveiled the new program in October 2024, 15 months ahead of Cisco 360 going into effect.
In its place will be two new designations: Cisco Portfolio Partner and Cisco Preferred Partner.
Additionally, Cisco Preferred partners will be eligible to earn two new specializations, Secure AI Infrastructure and Secure Networking, beginning next month, according to Cisco.","‘All along, [Cisco] stated their approach was to provide better capabilities to the customers and reward the partners that are investing in helping companies be successful with Cisco’s technology. The world that Cisco plays in is massively more competitive today than it’s ever been,’ one partner tells CRN as the new program went live.

Cisco 360, the overhaul of the networking giant’s nearly 25-year-old partner program, officially went live Sunday.

The objective of the new program, stacked with new resources, tools, and partner designations, is to help customers reach transformative AI outcomes faster through their trusted channel partners, Cisco said in a release issued Monday morning.

Steve Wylie, vice president and general manager, Northeast, for Cisco partner Trace3, is “excited” for the launch of Cisco 360. That’s because a positive byproduct of the new program is that it has required partners to uplevel their skills and training, a very important factor for partners in the age of AI and managed services.

“All along, [Cisco] stated their approach was to provide better capabilities to the customers and reward the partners that are investing in helping companies be successful with Cisco’s technology,” Wylie said. “The world that Cisco plays in is massively more competitive today than it’s ever been [and] the last thing they probably need is people out there selling Cisco that don’t have the core understanding of the in-depth capabilities and are just trying to push quotes. Pushing quotes doesn’t sell the AI factory-type things, it sells the things they’ve always sold, but Cisco is trying to get to a different place [and] to embrace new technology.”

Trace3 is going into the launch feeling prepared. The firm has dedicated resources in place for renewals, Cisco Black Belt trainings, and even a person on staff that was tasked with deeply understanding the requirements of the new program to ensure that Trace3 would be coming into Cisco 360 with the right skills. Trace3 is a Preferred Partner in each of the five core architectures that Cisco identified as part of the new program: Security, Networking, Cloud and AI, Collaboration, Services and Splunk/Observability.

“By requiring us to go through the process [or] discipline areas, it’s an opportunity to go and say: ‘OK, where are your gaps? Where can you go and improve? And also, where can you go and push your teams to train more?’” Wylie said.

Cisco first unveiled the new program in October 2024, 15 months ahead of Cisco 360 going into effect. Cisco’s early communications about 360 was beneficial for both Cisco and its partner community, said Wylie (pictured above).

“The runway was long. If you’re not prepared for it, you just haven’t put the time in,” he said. “I’m excited about it because with what we’re trying to do, the more knowledge our teams have the better. And I think this was a catalyst that pushed us towards that.”

Cisco 360 Details

Cisco 360 is simplifying the previously complex program structure via two new features: the Partner Value Index (PVI) to measure partners and the Cisco Partner Incentive (CPI), which will reward the investments that partners are making in Cisco’s broad portfolio, according to the company. Partners will receive a PVI measurement or score in each of the five core architectures.

The new Cisco Partner Locator tool will let customers search across the Cisco portfolios, such as security, networking, or Splunk, to identify the right partner, according to Cisco.

“With our partners, we’ve strengthened what is already a world-class ecosystem to deliver even greater value and help our mutual customers connect, protect and thrive,” Tim Coogan, Cisco’s senior vice president of global partner sales, said in a statement.

Also to be added soon to the PVI will be dedicated indexes for Developers/Advisors, Distributors, and Mass Scale Infrastructure, a portfolio that focuses on very large data center buildouts and service provider business, Cisco said.

The program will eliminate separate partner programs and incentives such as VIP—the company’s flagship rebate incentive program—Perform Plus and the Cisco Services Partner Program, or CSPP. These will be folded into a single structure, the CPI, which will measure partners across four areas: foundational, capabilities, performance, and engagement.

Another significant part of the new program is that Cisco is removing its illustrious Cisco Gold partner designation. In its place will be two new designations: Cisco Portfolio Partner and Cisco Preferred Partner. Cisco partners will be able to earn these designations for each technology portfolio. Additionally, Cisco Preferred partners will be eligible to earn two new specializations, Secure AI Infrastructure and Secure Networking, beginning next month, according to Cisco.

Cisco’s support for partners ahead of the launch has included frequent webinars and custom marketing programs. For Long View Systems, a Calgary, Alberta-based MSP and Cisco partner, work behind the scenes to ready the firm for the launch of the new program has included a focus on Black Belt trainings and PVI reviews to determine where the company will land within the new measurements.

Long View, a former Gold partner within Cisco’s former program, has achieved “Preferred” partner status in each of the five core architectures in Canada. While the firm is overall optimistic about Cisco 360 and its roadmap, Lane Irvine, network business solutions director for Long View, said the new program is currently lacking a way to recognize multi-architecture Preferred Partners.

“There isn’t a branding that helps customers see that you’ve got five Preferred [designations], something that highlights it as a different level of support than an individual Preferred Partner,” he said. “[A partner] who’s got Preferred in security, or Preferred in networking, is different than a partner that has Preferred in all five.”

He stressed that marketing activities will be important to educate customers on the new Preferred vs. the former Gold designation.

“Part of this is marketing it to our customers as well. What does this mean to them and helping them understand why it’s important for them,” Irvine said.

The focus has so far been on PVI, partners need Cisco to now switch gears and focus on CPI, or the incentive side, Irvine said.

“We generally understand PVI, but there’s a lot of information and data that’s got to come to out now to get this really dialed in … because of course the incentives, that’s a critical part of our profitability,” he said.

The good news is that the new program’s incentives and rebates so far “look pretty similar” to what Cisco’s VIP program previously offered, partners told CRN.

Now live, the CPI will simplify past program elements while offering partners clearer, more predictable earnings across Cisco’s portfolio. The CPI structure will help partners plan for growth by aligning forecasts and strategies with Cisco’s roadmap, according to the San Jose, Calif.-based company.",https://www.crn.com/news/networking/2026/media_1ade25d1dc0085cbacfca1b2bf0b0a697e2fa21a0.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2026-01-26 11:06:06.667607

On Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn.
“Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said.
“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.
The $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn.","A British AI startup that makes realistic video avatars has almost doubled its valuation to $4bn (£3bn), in a boost for the UK technology sector.

Synthesia was valued at $2.1bn last year and moved into new offices in central London, marking the moment with a ceremony attended by the Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor, and Peter Kyle, then technology secretary.

On Monday, it announced its latest funding round, led by an existing investor, Google Ventures, had raised $200m and valued the British company at $4bn. Google Ventures is the search firm’s venture capital arm.

Synthesia uses human actors to generate digital avatars of people and also offers employers the ability to create replicas of their staff. Those avatars are then deployed by organisations in corporate videos in a range of scenarios such as health and safety in the workplace, advising on cybersecurity and how to communicate better at work.

The company counts 70% of the FTSE 100 as clients, including NatWest, Lloyds Bank and British Gas. It is also used by non-corporate bodies including the NHS, the European Commission and the United Nations.

The startup is also developing new avatars that will help train employees and give them new skills, through scenarios such as role-playing and giving tailored explanations.

Synthesia’s co-founder, Steffen Tjerrild, said the increased valuation reflected the commitment of the company’s longstanding backers rather than the investment hype surrounding the AI sector. “Existing investors have seen the progress, have seen the numbers, have seen them compound year over year,” he said. “That is also telling a story that this is less [a case of] external investors trying to kind of hype it up, but more about validation from existing investors as well.”

Last year, a leading British tech investor, James Anderson, said he found sharp increases in valuations of AI startups such as OpenAI and Anthropic “disconcerting”. Tjerrild said Synthesia was focusing on executing its business plan, which, he added, was backed by investors who were long-term supporters.

“This round is led by insiders, or predominantly existing investors that deeply understand the business, have seen the execution and the improvement of the business over many years,” he said.

Synthesia generated revenues of $58.3m in 2024 but made a pre-tax loss of $59.2m, according to its latest published accounts, which the company said reflected its investment in headcount, its technology and new offices. Synthesia said it was on track to make $200m in revenues this year.

The $4bn valuation puts the company on a par with UK broadcaster ITV, which is worth £3.1bn. Tjerrild’s shareholding in Synthesia is now worth $160m, the same as its chief executive and fellow co-founder, Victor Riparbelli.

Synthesia was founded in 2017 by the two Danish nationals, as well as the computer scientists Matthias Niessner and Lourdes Agapito.

Last year, the London mayor said Synthesia was doing “incredibly well” as he opened its new offices. However, in a speech this month Khan said AI would “usher in a new era of mass unemployment” if used recklessly, as intelligent, autonomous systems proved cheap replacements for humans.

Tjerrild said he believed AI would enable businesses to hire more staff. “We’re an AI-first company, we have 600 employees and we hired 40% more people last year,” he said. “As a business owner myself, if my employees become more productive that means I can invest and hire more people.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f3830bbc58903f6db3ace02fd99c51fbdd1bd119/455_0_1956_1566/master/1956.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b9331eeb988edd9b025e527128f65fd3",N,,2026-01-26 10:01:05.590298

Newly constructed lines favor continuous modalities, reducing buffer consumption by up to 40% and minimizing water-for-injection needs. Regional governments view biomanufacturing as a strategic growth sector, as seen in Saudi Arabia's plan to contribute USD 34.6 billion to non-oil GDP by 2040. An oversupply in capacity among some CDMOs has temporarily reduced utilization below 50%, but the flexibility provided by intensified downstream skids allows for quick rescheduling without compromising quality. Vendors are bundling columns, resins, and analytical sensors to offer integrated platforms capable of switching between monoclonal and viral-vector products within hours.

Rising R&D Spending Among Big Pharma & Emerging Biotech

Large companies are increasing R&D budgets, while smaller firms face capital constraints. Eli Lilly allocated USD 4.5 billion to the Lilly Medicine Foundry to speed up clinical supply, resulting in increased demand for modular chromatography and tangential flow filtration systems. Venture-backed startups are focusing on cell and gene therapy pipelines, which require unique clarification and nuclease removal steps, contrasting significantly with traditional antibody workflows. This shift leads to diverse demand that benefits suppliers offering configurable skids and disposable flow paths. Continuous multicolumn chromatography is increasingly adopted, mitigating resin cost spikes with reduced bed volumes per kilogram of product.

High Capital Cost of Large-Scale Chromatography Skids and Resins

Protein A resin remains costly, consuming as much as 60% of downstream capital budgets. While Purolite's USD 200 million investment in a Pennsylvania plant aims to stabilize supply and prices, smaller firms remain challenged by costs. Intensified multicolumn operations cut resin usage by 50% and boost output per square foot, albeit with increased automation complexity. A bifurcation in the market is forming, where large pharma pays premiums for capture resins, while cost-sensitive companies seek mixed-mode or continuous alternatives.

Additional market drivers and restraints detailed in the report include:

The CMO/CDMO outsourcing surge and multi-year capacity agreements

mRNA and viral-vector vaccine platform scale-ups post-COVID

The purification bottleneck compared to upstream titers

Segment Analysis

The downstream processing market report segments include Technique (Purification Techniques, Solid-Liquid Separation, and others), Product (Chromatography Columns and Resins, among others), Application (Antibodies Production, Vaccines Production, etc.), End User (Biopharmaceutical & Bio-Similar Manufacturers, etc.), and Geography (North America, Europe, etc.). Market forecasts are presented in USD terms.

Purification techniques accounted for 32.05% of downstream processing market revenue in 2025, emphasizing their importance to biologics quality. Cell disruption is the fastest growing segment with a 14.88% CAGR, driven by the adoption of microbial and intracellular expression systems. The downstream market for purification is set to surpass USD 14.75 billion in 2026, potentially reaching USD 27 billion by 2031, supported by resin capacity expansions and innovations like multicolumn chromatography. Meanwhile, low-frequency acoustic methods gain traction in pilot-scale cell disruption trials due to reduced heat generation. Continuous chromatography's role in minimizing buffer usage supports sustainability goals that increasingly influence European procurement. Innovations such as single-use centrifuges and depth-filtration cassettes enhance throughput while reducing contamination risk in CDMO operations, contributing to improved facility productivity.

Chromatography columns and resins had a 35.10% revenue share in 2025, remaining the standard for antibody capture. However, filtration and membrane devices show the highest CAGR of 14.12%, driven by advancements in PFAS-free polymers, prompting replacement cycles. The market for filtration products achieved a size of USD 12.2 billion in 2026 and is expected to reach USD 23.6 billion by 2031. Multi-layer depth filters streamline processes by combining clarification and fine filtration, improving facility efficiency. Adaptive control valves and gamma-stable flow paths facilitate modular skids' reconfiguration, appealing to CMOs managing diverse client molecules. Chromatography suppliers are responding with high-throughput resin screening kits that cut development time by 30%. Despite debates over disposability costs, the adoption of single-use hardware continues to rise due to the reduced validation demands it offers.

Geographic Analysis

North America secured 32.50% of the revenue share in 2025, driven by substantial investments like Johnson & Johnson's USD 2 billion project in North Carolina. Continuous manufacturing processes were implemented in 75% of new lines, with plans for AI integration within three years. The downstream processing market benefits from the FDA's supportive stance on innovative manufacturing, boosting investor confidence in advanced purification platforms.

Asia-Pacific is the fastest growing region at a 14.35% CAGR, aided by large facilities in South Korea, China, Singapore, and India. With Samsung Biologics adding 180,000 L of capacity and Novartis expanding its Singapore site, a trend toward mega-facilities supporting global supply is manifesting. In response to the US Biosecure Act, Indian CDMOs are positioning themselves as alternatives. Regional governments are investing in workforce training to address process-engineering talent gaps and encourage local sourcing of essential supplies like filters and bags.

How Investors Are Reacting To CRH (CRH) Buybacks Amid Institutional Moves And US Infrastructure Push

January 26, 2026

In recent weeks, CRH plc has continued its US$300 million share buyback programme on the New York Stock Exchange, while the State of Alaska’s Department of Revenue disclosed an US$8.30 million new position in the company alongside other institutional portfolio adjustments.

At the same time, CRH Americas’ leadership has publicly pressed Congress to modernize US infrastructure, linking long-term economic activity to renewed investment in roads and bridges.

Against this backdrop of active buybacks, we’ll examine how CRH’s capital return focus shapes the company’s investment narrative for investors.

What Is CRH's Investment Narrative?

To own CRH, you need to be comfortable with a large, acquisitive building materials group whose fortunes are closely tied to construction cycles, public infrastructure spending and disciplined capital allocation. The ongoing US$300 million buyback, layered on top of years of sizeable repurchases and a growing dividend, reinforces a story built around returning cash while managing a high debt load and a relatively new executive team. The latest buyback trades and the State of Alaska’s US$8.30 million position do not materially change the near term catalysts, which still center on execution against 2025 earnings guidance and the health of North American construction. However, CRH Americas’ public push for renewed US infrastructure funding highlights a key swing factor: how quickly Congress acts on transportation bills could influence demand visibility and investor confidence over the next few years.

However, CRH’s reliance on policy support and leverage is something investors should not ignore. CRH's share price has been on the slide but might be up to 9% below fair value. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five Simply Wall St Community members place CRH’s fair value between about US$56.66 and US$140.00, underscoring how far opinions can diverge. Set that against CRH’s heavy buyback activity and policy sensitive earnings profile, and you can see why understanding different scenarios for US infrastructure spending and balance sheet risk really matters.

- why the stock might be worth as much as 14% more than the current price!

First, the medtech giant received CE mark approval for the first-of-its-kind, all-in-one mapping and single-shot PFA catheter. It also completed the first cases for the paroxysmal AFib treatment system in the Horizon 360 U.S. FDA investigational device exemption (IDE) trial.

It marks further milestones for Medtronic as it competes in the hot PFA space against the likes of Boston Scientific, Johnson & Johnson MedTech, Abbott and Kardium, all of whom have commercially available PFA systems.

“The achievement of CE Mark for Sphere-360, as well as the first cases in the U.S. IDE trial, mark two major achievements in our effort to deliver new and better treatments to AFib patients,” said Rebecca Seidel, president of the Cardiac Ablation Solutions business at Medtronic. “We’re committed to leading in PFA and bringing meaningful innovation at a regular cadence.”

Sphere-360, an investigational single-shot mapping and ablation catheter, uses pulsed field energy to treat patients with paroxysmal AFib. It integrates with the Affera mapping and ablation system. The Affera technology makes up a key component of Medtronic’s PulseSelect PFA system. It became the first such system FDA-cleared for treating AFib in 2024. Medtronic brought in these technologies through its $1 billion acquisition of Affera in August 2022.

Medtronic designed Sphere-360 with the goal of simplifying the AFib procedure while enhancing efficiency and providing high lesion durability. Sphere-360 features a large, tissue-conformable lattice tip for energy delivery. It requires no catheter rotation multiple times in one location as the entire lattice tip delivers PF energy. The company says it features the smallest sheath (8.5 Fr) in any single-shot PFA technology.

Other key features include the delivery of circumferential, consistent lesions and adaptation to the vein through the lattice tip. The all-in-one catheter can deliver navigation, mapping and ablation through a single transseptal puncture and zero catheter exchange. It provides easy access to pulmonary veins and enhanced stability with its over-the-wire design, too.

Medtronic supported its CE mark with data from its Sphere-360 European study, presented in April 2025. Findings demonstrated efficacy, safety and durability for the system.

The Horizon 360 IDE study, a prospective, single-arm clinical study across the U.S., will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Sphere-360 catheter with the Affera mapping and ablation system for treating paroxysmal AFib.

Doctors’ takes on the Medtronic Sphere-360 catheter

Dr. Tobias Reichlin, director of electrophysiology at Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland, said:

“The Sphere-360 catheter offers an excellent balance between ease of use and consistency in outcomes. Its design conforms to the pulmonary vein in a unique way that delivers consistent, effective and durable lesions for AFib patients, without any rotation of the catheter. With the full integration into the Affera mapping system, it’s an exciting step forward for patient care in Europe.”

Dr. Vivek Reddy, director of Cardiac Arrhythmia Services for the Mount Sinai Health System, New York, said:

“Advances in electrophysiology over the past several years are having a significant impact on care for arrhythmia patients, and Affera has been a key part of that impact. Now with Sphere-360, we have a new and differentiated single-shot PFA catheter with the potential to deliver the next phase of innovation. It’s an exciting time for physicians and patients and we’re not slowing down.”",https://wtwh-marketing.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/massdevice/2026/01/26062227/Medtronic-Affera-PFA-Sphere-360-catheter-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 09:01:12.454980

When do ​I get the AI drug?""","By Maggie Fick and Michael Erman

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence has yet to deliver on the ‌most ​challenging aspect of drug development -- finding new molecules that lead ‌to major medical advances -- but it is already streamlining less glamorous parts of the process, industry executives say.

AI is helping find participants and ​sites for clinical trials and drafting documents for regulators, shaving weeks off these labor-intensive processes, seven large drugmakers and six smaller biotech companies said at the recent JP Morgan Healthcare Conference.

It can take a decade and $2 ‍billion to bring a new drug to market, pharmaceutical ​companies say. Many, including Eli Lilly, which has partnered with leading chipmaker Nvidia, are betting AI can also improve the success rate of new drugs.

Drug companies have announced a slew of deals for tools to ​unleash the promise of ⁠AI, seen as the biggest technological upheaval since the internet, much as other industries are doing.

Agentic AI - or AI that is autonomous requiring little human intervention - could increase clinical development productivity by about 35% to 45% over the next five years, consultancy McKinsey predicted last year.

Israel-based Teva Pharmaceutical Industries said it is utilizing AI in multiple ways so it can focus on the big picture goal of successfully bringing new drugs to market.

""Everything else that's around that needs to be as efficient and as small as possible,"" Teva CEO Richard Francis said. ""This is where I ‌think AI digitization, modernization, process improvement, all the unsexy stuff that we get actually quite excited about, makes a difference.""

THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS

Executives from global pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca, Roche and ​Pfizer, ‌as well as smaller biotechs like Spyre and ‍Nuvalent, described tracking thousands of pages of ⁠documents for regulators, including clinical, safety and manufacturing records.

The documents must be compiled, cross-checked and kept consistent across geographies, often requiring the costly use of outside contractors, AstraZeneca Chief Financial Officer Aradhana Sarin explained.

Jorge Conde, a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, is investing in fixes to what he calls drug development's ""messy middle,"" including putting $4.3 million into startup Alleviate Health.

He described trial enrollment as a ""leaky funnel"" in which participants drop out along the way, and sees Alleviate using AI technology to help with patient outreach, education, screening and scheduling.

TD Cowen analyst Brendan Smith said the use of AI, including large language models like Microsoft Copilot, for administrative tasks has become fairly common in the pharmaceutical industry.

But it may take another one to three years before investors can measure how AI has begun speeding up drug development, he said. Quantifying savings ​is difficult, Smith said, as it depends on how and where the tools are deployed.

NOVARTIS USES AI FOR HEART DRUG

Swiss drugmaker Novartis turned to AI in 2023 when it was starting a 14,000-person, late-stage cardiovascular outcomes trial for its cholesterol drug Leqvio, Chief Medical Officer Shreeram Aradhye said.

The typical four- to six-week site selection process became a two-hour meeting, as AI helped identify higher-performing sites and allowed Novartis to close participant enrollment with only 13 patients above its trial target, Aradhye said.

""AI becomes augmenting intelligence, not artificial intelligence,"" he added.

A Novartis spokesperson said the time savings afforded by AI can add up to months over a drug-development program.

GSK, GENMAB, ITM PLAN FOR SAVINGS

British drugmaker GSK said it's using a mix of digital and AI tools to reduce manual data collection and aggregation and trial enrollment, and aims to speed up all clinical trials by 15% this way.

That helped save about 8 million pounds ($10.87 million) in costs for late-stage studies of asthma drug Exdensur last year, according to a GSK spokesperson. The drug won U.S. approval last month.

Danish antibody developer Genmab said it plans to deploy Anthropic's Claude chatbot-powered agentic AI to support clinical development priorities.

Hisham Hamadeh, Genmab's head of AI, said ​the goal is to automate post-trial work, including analysis of data and its transformation into graphs, tables, figures and clinical study reports.

German radiopharmaceuticals firm ITM told Reuters it has figured out how to use AI to convert long trial reports into U.S. FDA template formats, potentially saving weeks of effort requiring several staff, but has yet to deploy it.

Amgen research chief Jay Bradner said AI is delivering on multiple fronts in the drug development and regulatory document preparation process.

“What everybody's waiting for is the AI drug. When do ​I get the AI drug?"" he said. ""I actually think those molecules are in pipelines right now.""

WORLD

The Trump-Carney détente is over

It wasn’t just large swaths of the country getting snowed in this weekend — the relationship between Ottawa and the White House also went back into deep freeze.

What happened: Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on “all Canadian goods and products” if “Canada makes a deal with China,” and later suggested he would stop a Chinese “takeover” of Canada. Trump also referred to Mark Carney as “governor” for the first time, hauling that old chestnut out of storage.

What constitutes a “deal” is not clear. Canada’s minister responsible for U.S. trade tried to cast the recent agreement with China as a “resolution” and denied that the government was pursuing a broader free trade pact.

For Trump, it’s a sharp reversal from his initial reaction that “it’s a good thing for [Carney] to sign a trade deal” with China.

Elsewhere: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent blasted Carney over the China agreement, saying, “We can’t let Canada become an opening that the Chinese pour their cheap goods into the U.S.”

Bessent seemed to suggest that the tariffs would only apply if Canada struck a free trade deal with China, but — as is usually the case with this crew — his meaning was not totally clear.

Why it matters: Canada is back in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, and the escalation over the weekend is a preview of what’s to come as CUSMA comes up for renegotiation.

Our take: Unfortunately, the threat of ripping up CUSMA — which has so far kept most of our exports to the U.S. tariff-free — gives the Americans enormous leverage over Canada. Preserving that deal with a volatile administration in the White House while also expanding trade with other large economies, like China’s, will be a dangerous high-wire balancing act.—TS

🏦 Interest rate decisions in Canada, U.S. Both the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the U.S. Federal Reserve are expected to hold interest rates steady on Wednesday. BoC Governor Tiff Macklem said last month that the BoC would hold rates at 2.25% so long as inflation continued to stabilize, and that’s more or less what has happened since. There is more pressure for the Fed to cut rates, both from the Trump administration and some FOMC members, but Jerome Powell hasn’t shown much appetite to indulge demands from those quarters.

🇨🇦 Conservative Party convention. Pierre Poilievre faces a leadership review at his party’s convention later this week, with around 4,000 delegates voting on whether he should stay on as leader. Poilievre only needs the support of a majority of delegates to keep the job, but a close vote would certainly weaken his position. That’s a possible outcome, but without any obvious successor waiting in the wings, it would be a surprise.

🇺🇸 U.S. government shutdown deadline. The U.S. federal government could partially shut down (again) if a spending package isn’t approved by Friday. Odds of a shutdown increased dramatically (now around 75% on prediction markets) after a man was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis over the weekend. Democrats responded by promising to block any bill that includes funding for the Department of Homeland Security without reforms to the agency.

BUSINESS

Little League has turned into big money

It turns out, parents will pay a lot of money to watch their nine-year-old's soccer game on TV.

Driving the news: Montreal-based live sports streamer LiveBarn has been acquired by U.S. private equity (PE) firm GTCR for ~US$400 million, the latest in a string of PE buyouts in the youth sports space.

LiveBarn is kind of like ESPN for youth sports, with cameras capturing live games in over 4,000 arenas, courts, and fields across North America.

The company offers a streaming subscription that includes live game feeds, highlight packages of individual players, and even data analysis — a feature we’re confident has made life more difficult for the children of overly intense hockey parents.

Why it matters: Youth sports have evolved from a primarily non-profit-run space to become a US$40 billion a year industry, larger than the recorded music, box office, and sports betting sectors.

Eager parents have been a driving factor in this shift, paying tens of thousands of dollars for personal coaching, academies, scouting tournaments and other services that give their kid a better shot at going pro.

Whether it’s delusion or aspiration, one study found that ~20% of American parents believe their kid could play Division I college sports, while 10% believe their kid will make it to a pro league or the Olympics.

Our take: Canadian families already spend an average of over $3,000 a year on their kids' athletic endeavours. As private equity continues to move into the space, the goal of maximizing profits could make youth sports less accessible for Canadians.—LA",https://beehiiv-images-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/asset/file/446339a1-b302-43de-a95b-6cdec78763df/Newsletter_Graphics.png?t=1769371540,N,,2026-01-26 07:00:27.963280

Fitch has also assigned a 'B+' rating with a Recovery Rating of 'RR3' to the proposed first lien $1.25 billion senior secured term loan B issued under Industrial F&B Investments III, Inc. The ratings assume an additional $550 million of pari passu secured debt. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

The ratings reflect the company's weak performance trends, execution issues, high leverage, and modest scale with EBITDA in the high-$300 million range. The ratings consider the company's leading position in the North America private-label category.

Following the take-private transaction of Treehouse by Investindustrial, pro forma leverage is expected to be around 4.9x, with modest incremental debt, which is largely leverage neutral. Fitch expects leverage to trend around 5.0x over the medium term with ongoing investments in the business driving topline and volume stabilization, funded by anticipated operating efficiencies.

Key Rating Drivers

Execution Issues, Weak Volume Trends: Over the past decade, TreeHouse has undergone multiple transformations in efforts to reshape its portfolio for growth, with volume pressure since 2016. It acquired businesses to gain scale but struggled to achieve synergies. Despite various strategic efforts to reduce complexity through divestitures and shifting to higher-growth, higher-margin product categories, volumes declined in 2023 and 2024, driven by supply chain disruptions and product recalls. Fitch forecasts a 4% decline in organic sales in 2025, reflecting ongoing volume pressures and continued operational inefficiencies, driven by recalls and margin management initiatives.

Private-label products typically perform well during periods of financial strain, as consumers trade down from branded products for affordability and value. Industry private-label penetration grew in 2024 and 2025 given increased consumer focus on value following several years of high inflation. Despite this tailwind, Treehouse's volumes declined due to temporary facility closures and quality control issues. Fitch expects TreeHouse's organic sales to be relatively flat in 2026 as volume declines moderate to low single digits versus a projected 8% decline in 2025, driven by resolution of supply chain issues, investments in innovation and go-to-market strategies.

Take Private Acquisition: On Nov. 10, 2025, TreeHouse agreed to be taken private by Investindustrial in an all-cash deal valued at $2.9 billion, or around 8x Fitch-adjusted LTM September 2025 EBITDA. This is the second deal between the companies in four years, following Investindustrial's $950 million acquisition of the majority of TreeHouse's Meal Preparation business in August 2022.

The post-acquisition capital structure is expected to be largely leverage neutral, consisting of a $1.25 billion proposed Term Loan B and $550 million of other secured debt issued to repay the existing $1.7 billion debt, which includes outstanding borrowings under its A/R securitization program. Fitch believes that, under new management with experience in its legacy business, TreeHouse could realize cost savings and improve profitability over the medium term.

Relatively Small Industry Player: Although TreeHouse is a leader in the North American private label space, it is smaller than many branded packaged food competitors. The Campbell's Company (Campbell; BBB-/Stable), a direct competitor in broth and snacks, generated $10.3 billion of total net revenue and over $1.8 billion of EBITDA in fiscal 2025 (ended August 31), compared with Treehouse's 2024 revenue and EBITDA of around $3.5 billion and $370 million, respectively. Fitch expects TreeHouse's EBITDA to remain in the high-$300 million range over the next 12-24 months as the company focuses on improving supply chain capabilities and reducing business complexity.

Stable Margins, Modest FCF Generation: In 2025, Fitch expects margins to remain relatively flat at 11% versus 10.9% in 2024, driven primarily by ongoing cost-saving initiatives offsetting volume declines. With new management, Fitch expects margins to remain in 11% range with topline stabilization and investments in operational efficiencies. The company has historically generated positive FCF, excluding working capital swings from divestitures, due to minimal capex. Fitch expects FCF to be around $100 million in 2025 and modestly positive thereafter, driven by higher cash interest expenses, restructuring costs, and higher capex to fund operational capabilities.

Elevated Leverage: Fitch expects pro forma leverage for 2025 to be around 4.9x, in line with 2024, reflecting flattish EBITDA and modest incremental debt from the transaction. Beginning 2026, Fitch expects leverage to be flat at around 5.0x, reflect stable EBITDA and debt levels.

Peer Analysis

Treehouse's 'B' rating and Stable Outlook reflects the company's weak performance trends, execution issues, high leverage, and modest scale, with EBITDA in the high-$300 million range. Other rated peers include The Kraft Heinz Company (Kraft Heinz; BBB/Rating Watch Negative), The Campbell's Company (Campbell; BBB-/Stable), and Conagra Brands, Inc. (Conagra; BBB-/Stable).

Kraft Heinz's rating reflects its portfolio of strong brands and actions taken to strengthen its market position through portfolio optimization and repositioning efforts. The Negative Rating Watch reflects the company's announced plan to separate into two entities: Global Taste Elevation Co. (Remain Co) and North American Grocery Co. Fitch expects to resolve the Rating Watch when there is greater clarity on RemainCo's pro forma capital structure, operating and cash flow prospects and long-term financial policy.

Campbell's ratings reflect the company's strong brands, significant market share in several product categories and leverage sustained in the high-3x range. Fitch expects EBITDA could decline in the low- to mid-teens in fiscal 2026, driven by the weak topline, higher input costs and ongoing reinvestment into the business and recover modestly thereafter. Leverage is expected to be around 4.2x in fiscal 2026 and in the high-3x range in fiscal 2027, assuming FCF is used towards debt reduction.

Conagra's ratings reflect its position as one of the largest players in the U.S. packaged foods industry, with a strong presence in the frozen, refrigerated and snacking categories. Fitch expects EBITDA to trend toward the high $1 billion range in fiscal 2026, with EBITDA leverage approaching 4x.

Fitch's Key Rating-Case Assumptions

2025 organic sales is expected to decline by 4% driven by high-single digit volume declines offset by mid-single digit pricing actions. Beyond 2025, organic sales is expected to be flattish from volume stabilization.

EBITDA is expected to be $370 million in 2025 relative to $366 million in 2024 and remain relatively flat thereafter. EBITDA margin is expected to be 11% in 2025, a modest increase from 10.9% in 2024, as the company manages inflationary pressures with cost-savings initiatives. Margins are expected to remain in the 11% range from ongoing supply chain optimization and increased investment into marketing and innovation.

FCF is expected to be around $100 million in 2025 with capex of $125 million. Beyond 2025, FCF is expected to be minimal, driven by higher cash interest burden and capex of $150 million- $170 million annually.

Leverage is expected to improve in 2025 to 4.8x from 4.9x in 2024, before increasing to 5.0x in 2026, as the company continues to invest in operational excellence to stabilize topline and position for growth. Leverage is expected remain in the 5.0x range over the forecast period from flattish EBITDA and debt levels.

Corporate Rating Tool Inputs and Scores

Fitch scored the issuer as follows, using our Corporate Rating Tool (CRT) to produce the Standalone Credit Profile (SCP):

Business and financial profile factors (assessment, relative importance): Management (b+, Moderate), Sector Characteristics (b, Higher), Market and Competitive Positioning (b+, Moderate), Diversification and Asset Quality (b+, Moderate), Company Operational Characteristics (b, Higher), Profitability (b+, Moderate), Financial Structure (b+, Moderate), and Financial Flexibility (bb, Lower).

The quantitative financial subfactors are based on custom CRT financial period parameters: 20% weight for the forecast year 2025, 40% for the forecast year 2026 and 40% for the forecast year 2027.

B+ to CC considerations apply in our analysis and result in no adjustment.

The Governance assessment of 'Good' results in no adjustment.

The Operating Environment assessment of 'aa-' results in no adjustment.

The SCP is 'b'.

Recovery Analysis

Fitch conducts a bespoke recovery analysis when assigning and monitoring instrument ratings for issuers with IDRs of 'B+' and below. The recovery analysis assumes that TreeHouse would be reorganized in bankruptcy as a going concern (GC) rather than being liquidated. The recovery analysis further assumes the RCF will be fully drawn.

TreeHouse' recovery analysis is based on a going concern enterprise value. Fitch assumes a $250 million going concern EBITDA. The going concern EBITDA reflects a scenario of continued market share losses given ongoing execution issues and/or increased competition in its portfolio categories, which results in revenue declining about 25% to $2.5 billion from $3.4 billion of revenues estimated for 2025. EBITDA margins are assumed to be around 10%, reflecting continued operational issues and marketing efforts to improve sales, offset partially by cost cutting and supply chain optimization efforts achieved through bankruptcy.

TreeHouse's recovery analysis uses a 6.0x EV multiple. This compares to the 6.4x median bankruptcy multiple for food, beverage and consumer companies. The EV multiple considers the company's diversified product offerings, offset by its relatively small scale with a focus on private label compared to other branded peers.

RATING SENSITIVITIES

Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade

Revenue and EBITDA declines due to market share losses or margin pressures, operational issues or debt-financed dividends or acquisitions that would cause leverage to be sustained above 6.0x.

Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade

Stabilization in volume trends with EBITDA improvements such that leverage is sustained below 5.0x.

Liquidity and Debt Structure

Fitch views TreeHouse's post-closing liquidity as satisfactory, with approximately $400 million of ABL capacity. This is viewed relative to 1.0% amortization on the $1.25 billion term loan B, with payment commencing after the first full fiscal year. TreeHouse's proposed capital structure consists of approximately $400 million ABL revolver, a first-lien $1.25 billion term loan B, and $550 million of other secured debt. Proceeds are expected to be used towards repaying existing debt and outstanding borrowings under its A/R securitization program.

Prior to the announcement of the acquisitions, as of Sept. 30, 2025, TreeHouse had around $400 million in liquidity, including $21 million in cash and $372.2 million available under its $500 million secured RCF due Jan. 17, 2030 (netting $95 million of borrowings and $32.8 million of letters of credit). In addition to the revolver, the company's capital structure included a $422.9 million secured term loan A-1 due January 2030, a $480 million of secured term loan A due January 2030, and a $500 million unsecured bond due September 2028. The company also has a A/R securitization program in place and as of Sept. 30, 2025, the total outstanding borrowings on the facility was $221.7 million.

Issuer Profile

TreeHouse is the leading manufacturer and distributor of private label packaged foods and beverages in North America. The company has 24 production facilities and distributes both private label and regionally branded products to supermarkets, mass merchandisers, and specialty retailers.

Fitch adjusted historical EBITDA for stock-based compensation, restructuring expenses, other non-recurring items.

The deadline for submitting responses to the CMA’s interim report following its phase 2 investigation is 5pm on February 12.

Constellation, owner of auction giant BCA, first announced the deal to buy Aston Barclay in April 2025.

However, the deal has been subject to competition clearance through the CMA and was referred to a phase 2 investigation in October last year.

Now, the CMA’s interim report has said: “The CMA has provisionally found that the completed acquisition by Constellation of Aston Barclay…has not resulted, and may not be expected to result, in a substantial lessening of competition in the supply of business-to-business (B2B) used vehicle auction services in Great Britain.”

Aston Barclay may have excited market if not for Constellation deal

The CMA report also mentions that Aston Barclay was ""facing financial challenges prior to the merger"", so would most likely have exited the market without the deal with Constellation.

The CMA said that its provisional indication is “not our final decision” and has invited any interested parties to comment on the findings and its phase 2 report before the acquisition is fully cleared.

Further details from the report show: ""The CMA found that the merger does not raise competition concerns at a local or regional level, as there are a large number of B2B used vehicle auction providers with local or regional coverage.

As the company's stock price grapples with technical weakness, prominent asset managers are making substantial, yet contrasting, moves, highlighting a battle of convictions over the software giant's future.

Recent regulatory filings reveal a stark divide in how large investors are positioning themselves. In the most notable development, the renowned growth-oriented investment firm Baillie Gifford & Co. established a brand new position, acquiring 50,514 shares valued at approximately $17.82 million. This substantial entry signals a clear long-term confidence vote from the Scottish manager, despite the stock's recent performance.

This bullish stance was echoed by other institutional buyers. Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft FI increased its holdings by 25.4%, bringing its total to 18,144 shares. Similarly, Investment House LLC expanded its position by 7.1% to 95,506 shares.

Conversely, a separate cohort of investors is scaling back exposure. Quilter Plc reduced its stake by a significant 42.8%, selling 12,670 shares. Y Intercept Hong Kong Ltd also cut its position, executing a 30% reduction.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

Solid Fundamentals Meet Technical Headwinds

This institutional tug-of-war unfolds against a backdrop of robust business performance juxtaposed with challenging market mechanics. Adobe's latest quarterly results surpassed expectations, with earnings per share coming in at $5.50 against a forecast of $5.40. Revenue climbed 10.5% year-over-year to $6.19 billion, also exceeding the $6.11 billion consensus estimate. Looking ahead, the company has set an ambitious target for fiscal year 2026, guiding for earnings per share in the range of $23.30 to $23.50.

Technically, however, the equity faces pressure. The current share price trades notably below key moving averages, residing under both the 50-day average near $331 and the 200-day average around $344. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 32.38, the stock is technically in oversold territory. This disconnect between double-digit revenue growth—fueled in part by AI products like Firefly—and the weak price action reflects broader market skepticism regarding software valuations in the current AI-focused investment climate.

Analysts Maintain a Constructive Outlook

The analyst community remains largely optimistic. Consensus ratings from 25 to 34 covering analysts point to a ""Moderate Buy"" recommendation. Their average price targets, ranging from $421 to $450, suggest substantial upside potential from current trading levels. Institutional ownership of the float stands at 81.79%, indicating that despite the recent portfolio adjustments, the vast majority of institutional capital remains committed.

The critical question now is whether new large-scale investors like Baillie Gifford can help establish a support level around the $300 mark. Upcoming quarterly earnings reports will be pivotal in determining if Adobe can reaffirm its annual targets and demonstrate that its AI strategy is delivering the anticipated results.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2444315_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 01:59:20.783863

The project also supported the overall growth of the company by linking industry-academic cooperation institutions and professional support institutions.
In addition, technological competitiveness was enhanced through the recruitment of research personnel and joint R&D of industry-academia research and development.
In the second year of the project, which is being promoted this year, the connection between global expansion and technology commercialization will be further strengthened.
""The Legend 50+ 2.0 project is a corporate growth support model that organically links technology development, commercialization, exports, and digital transformation,"" said Kim Hyun-gon, head of the Korea Research Institute.","Gyeonggi Province's Advanced BioHealth Small and Medium Business Project Legend 50+ 2.0"" promoted by Gyeonggi-do Province and the Gyeonggi-do Economic Science Promotion Agency achieved the highest S grade among 16 participating regions in the regional specialization project 2.0 performance evaluation organized by the Ministry of SMEs and Startups.

According to the Korea Research Institute on the 26th, the ""Legend 50+ 2.0"" project is a mid- to long-term corporate growth support project that strengthens the growth base of the bio-health industry in the province for three years from 2025 to 2027 in connection with the regional specialization project of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups.

The Korea Research Institute selected 27 promising companies in the pharmaceutical, medical devices, and digital healthcare sectors in the province as participating companies and provided intensive support for the first year in 2025. The project also supported the overall growth of the company by linking industry-academic cooperation institutions and professional support institutions.

Over the past year, the Korea Economic Research and Extension Service has pushed for a total of 47 cases, worth about 3.2 billion won, in connection with the core policy projects of the Ministry of SMEs and Startups and the self-support projects of Gyeonggi Province.

It supported technology advancement and business expansion by linking innovation vouchers, export vouchers, and policy funds. In addition, technological competitiveness was enhanced through the recruitment of research personnel and joint R&D of industry-academia research and development.

It is characterized by a support structure that encompasses the entire business growth cycle from technology development to commercialization and export, such as AX and DX vouchers, participation in overseas exhibitions, support for overseas expansion of medical device companies, and response to trade crises.

This is expected to generate results such as an increase in sales of 37 billion won, an increase in exports of 9.8 million dollars, and job creation of 60 people, and is expected to lead to a growth base and strengthening industrial competitiveness of participating companies.

With the support of AX and DX vouchers, Korea BioSelf has advanced circulatory tumor cell analysis and counting technology in cancer patients' blood. It promoted the development of liquid biopsy-based AI analysis software to improve technology completion. In this process, three patents were applied and one was registered. Employment in related fields, including partner companies, has also been expanded.

Subsequently, medical device company Suil Development achieved entry into the European market by supporting participation in overseas exhibitions. He participated in the Society for Diabetes (EASD) held in Austria and signed a $500,000 field contract with Germany's Mediq. It also discussed cooperation with France's Air Liquide company in multi-regional expansion. This laid the foundation for European market expansion.

Gyeonggi-do Province and the Economic and Social Development Institute will manage sales growth, job creation, and export expansion of participating companies as key indicators and check policy effects based on performance indicators. In the second year of the project, which is being promoted this year, the connection between global expansion and technology commercialization will be further strengthened.

""The Legend 50+ 2.0 project is a corporate growth support model that organically links technology development, commercialization, exports, and digital transformation,"" said Kim Hyun-gon, head of the Korea Research Institute.

But if an agent is going to make decisions in a newsroom, it can’t be a black box.
This isn’t just about getting information—it’s about the context it relies on when taking action.
For organizations to truly advance into the agent era, they’ll need to adopt an old adage: trust, but verify.","The last couple of months have seen a lot of progress on this front. While I was at CES, I attended Lenovo’s keynote, which unveiled Qira, an always-on AI that will be built into its devices going forward. As I wrote about at The Media Copilot, the innovation with Qira is that the assistant is now an “orchestrator of agents,” seamlessly passing off the user to other services like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or others, depending on the user’s request.

The reason a device maker like Lenovo can do that is because it doesn’t compete with those services—Qira is a facilitator, not a do-everything AI service. It appears Apple has also finally woken up to that strategy now that it’s announced a multi-year deal to integrate Google’s Gemini models into a revamped Siri later this year.

Apple has colossally overpromised and underdelivered on AI over the past two years, partly because of its reluctance to rely on partners for parts of its AI experience. Now that there’s more clarity on the orchestrator vision—and on how AIs talk to each other—it looks like we’re past concerns over empowering competitors.

Assistants evolve into agents

Into all this come agentic tools like Claude Code and Claude Coworker. The buzz around these tools in the AI world has been insane, and a big part of the reason is they can do much more than code and build websites. They are effectively agents, able to take instructions, turn them into plans, and then execute on them, often with minimal guidance from the user. Whether it lives in the OS (Qira/Siri) or in a desktop app (Cowork), the effect is the same: decision-making moves closer to the interface people actually use.

Several people on X say the experience using Coworker is closer to working with a colleague rather than prompting an AI. But there are new worries, too: Anthropic is warning users about safety risks—like unclear instructions leading to file deletion—because that’s what happens when the model can act, not just talk.

All this is pointing in the same direction. Sometime soon, it seems likely that a significant and growing amount of device interactions will be essentially telling agents what to do. No apps, no browser—just the answer, output, or outcome you were looking for. It’s the Enterprise computer, just not on the bridge of a starship but in millions of pockets worldwide.

There are huge implications for the media, brands, and other content providers. In my Qira piece, I talked about how the battle for context is going to play out in the information space in the coming year, but agent-based work will also have an effect on information-based work itself, especially journalism. Embedding an agent—essentially a decision-making computer—into your workspace is potentially a huge accelerant, but it poses difficult questions around attribution, access, and how it treats sensitive data.

Auditability in the agent era

Sounds serious, and there’s a simple solution to those concerns: don’t use it. But that’s not a strategy. Like any tool, those who learn it, use it, and master it will have an advantage over those who don’t. As agentic work grows in popularity, the workplaces that figure out how to implement it safely and securely will have the best chance of success.

The media is particularly challenged, though, since information is their business. We’ve already seen this play out with regard to hallucinations. The propensity of AI systems to make things up out of the blue continues to persist, and it keeps many newsrooms from adopting AI, at least in any way that touches content.

The danger of a workplace agent is more insidious. The AI isn’t creating content per se, but it is making decisions such as what information sources to use, what services to help with a task, and what company knowledge to apply to any specific request. But if an agent is going to make decisions in a newsroom, it can’t be a black box.

Even without the AI making a mistake per se, the question of how the AI makes its decisions matters. Look at the corollary in search: When Google made a deal with Reddit, which led to Reddit appearing at the top of many more search results. That unquestionably had an influence on where people got their information, especially since Google is an effective monopoly on search.

Well, a device or workplace agent will have a similar monopoly. How an agent goes down a tree of decisions can’t be a black box. Certainly, steering workers toward sanctioned services and company software is an obvious first step. Following style guides and company policy in the actions it takes is another. But it’s in the parts of workflows that aren’t covered by that where things get strange. This isn’t just about getting information—it’s about the context it relies on when taking action.

The need for AI governance

While actions need to be seamless to the user, there needs to be an auditable paper trail for them. How the agent gets context from the web, and from which services, should be clear and traceable. When asked, in plain language, why it took a specific action, there should be a rabbit hole the user can go down if they wish, along with a method to correct any problems in its thinking (including bias). Disclaimers won’t cut it on agents—training how to both use them and audit your own use, should be standard.

In other words, governance matters. Agents like Qira and Claude Coworker might deliver on the dream of true AI assistants. But the potential they promise to unlock requires an equal amount of deference. If AI has shown anything over the past few years, it’s that it can do incredible things, but it can’t be trusted to always get it right. For organizations to truly advance into the agent era, they’ll need to adopt an old adage: trust, but verify.",https://fastcompanyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/The-agent-era-is-coming.-Newsroo.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 01:59:40.415509

Through the successful Soul Lot prototype and gaining certainty in 2nm production, I realized that miracles are not something that simply happens—they are created.
What must never be done in engineer development is damaging an engineer's confidence.","Rapidus is advancing at an extraordinary pace toward the mass production of the world's most advanced 2nm semiconductors. With mass production scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2027 and the pilot line having started operation in April 2025, time is of the essence. What supports the successful completion of this extremely challenging development within such a short time frame, are the engineers working on the front lines. Shigehiro Fujino, senior executive officer and deputy director of the Rapidus Engineering Center, shares the story of their struggles, growth and the path that led to confidence in achieving 2nm technology.

Career Path and Technical Goals Expected by the Company

――Can you tell us about your career and what Rapidus expected from you?

I come from a background in materials science. After working at a company in South Korea, I went to the United States to pursue my Ph.D. After earning my doctorate, I joined my previous employer—a flash memory manufacturer—because I was told I would be directly involved in materials development.

At the time, the company was still a small venture. It later formed a joint venture with a major Japanese manufacturer and established operations in Yokkaichi, Mie Prefecture.

After joining Rapidus, I was given two missions.

The first was to learn the gate-all-around (GAA) technology developed by IBM and establish the corresponding manufacturing processes for Rapidus. The second was to transfer the technology established at IBM's research facility in Albany, New York, to IIM-1 in Chitose, Hokkaido, and make it ready for production.

IBM's cooperation was essential to achieving this, and my experience in joint ventures is what led to my selection for this role.

Engineer Development Through Collaboration with IBM

――What do you tell engineers when they are first dispatched to Albany?

I always talk about three things: integrity, respect and perseverance.

Integrity means being honest with data and results. People sometimes feel tempted to make themselves look better, but I emphasize the importance of reporting results exactly as they are.

Respect is equally important. Achieving results requires cooperation with other engineers. Since someone else's success ultimately leads to your own success, I ask engineers to approach their work with a strong spirit of collaboration.

Perseverance might better be described as grit—the ability to persist until success is achieved. An engineer's job is to make what was once impossible possible, so I stress the importance of continuing until you grasp success.

――For many engineers, collaboration with IBM must have been a first-time experience. What kind of support did you provide?

The engineers assigned to Albany came from a wide range of backgrounds in terms of age and specialization. To move the project forward, we needed everyone aligned in the same direction.

After clearly showing that direction, I told them, ""I want you to think for yourselves about what needs to be done and act accordingly.""

IBM's cooperation was indispensable. To break down organizational barriers and truly function as one team, we named the project Titans, after a famous movie. We deliberately avoided dividing roles between Rapidus and IBM so that we could advance development as a single team.

We also arranged desks in an island layout, commonly seen in Japanese companies, to encourage open communication.

――For Japanese engineers, the language barrier can be a major challenge. What was necessary to overcome it?

You must never give up, and you must persist in communicating your own opinions.

At first, your English may be limited, and you may think you have communicated your point. However, to truly convey your opinion, you need to keep at it—sometimes repeating yourself several times. Only after that should you consider whether the issue lies with your own understanding or with the other person.

Through trial and error, opportunities for communication increase. That leads to the next action and creates a positive cycle. This is not limited to English—engineers who deliver results are those who persistently repeat their efforts.

When Confidence Turned into Certainty in 2nm Development

――Can you share an example that left a strong impression during the challenges leading up to 2nm development?

The most memorable moment occurred in July 2024.

At that time, we were forced to significantly revise our development strategy. We had to choose whether to pursue both the existing and new approaches in parallel, or to integrate them into a single approach.

The engineers made a committed decision themselves, fully aware of the risks, and chose the latter. Despite the limited time remaining, they ultimately achieved the required results within the deadline.

Had we pursued two approaches in parallel—one led by Rapidus and the other by IBM—the team we had built might have fallen apart. The engineers were able to make this decision because they shared a clear understanding that the goal was to develop the world's most advanced 2nm semiconductors at IIM-1. This achievement was possible only because we came together as one team—Titans.

――At what moment did you feel confident that 2nm development using Rapidus' unique approach was on track?

First, we confirmed transistor performance in Albany. At that moment, I felt that the core technology had been established.

Beyond that, we had a critical milestone to achieve by March 2025. When we reached it, my confidence deepened further.

Another major milestone was the Soul Lot, announced on July 18. We developed GAA transistors at IIM-1 and confirmed that their characteristics met expectations.

Four engineers who joined the company after completing their doctoral programs in 2024 returned to IIM-1. When I asked them, ""Can you really make 2nm semiconductors?"" they answered clearly, ""You don't need to worry. We will see this through to the very end."" Hearing that from engineers who had once seemed uncertain made everything feel attainable.

Engineers Grown in New York Shine at IIM-1

――Can you tell us about the engineers' achievements during the manufacturing of the Soul Lot?

First, I must express my gratitude to all the partners involved. The construction company that built IIM-1, the equipment manufacturers who installed tools and the materials suppliers who provided essential materials—all played vital roles in completing the Soul Lot.

Within Rapidus, the process engineers worked particularly hard. Producing 2nm semiconductors involves processes such as film deposition, lithography, etching and polishing. Each process has dedicated engineers, and their dedication truly stood out.

In December 2024, the EUV lithography equipment arrived from ASML in the Netherlands—like a long-awaited Christmas gift. However, production requires many other tools as well. Within just two and a half months, we installed more than 200 pieces of equipment and brought them online—making it possible to run lots, all without major incidents.

I am deeply grateful to the process engineers who made it possible to begin lot operations on April 1, 2025, exactly as planned.

――Do you have any memorable examples regarding the growth of engineers dispatched to New York?

Two engineers, in particular, exemplified the remarkable growth we witnessed through this project.

The first was an engineer who was entrusted with full responsibility for overseeing prototype operations while an IBM team member was away on a week vacation. This role required sound judgment, focus and a strong sense of ownership, which he embraced the opportunity with immense commitment.

Reflecting on the experience, he later told me, ""At Rapidus, the value of even one second feels completely different. I can truly feel myself growing at an incredible pace."" To me this really drove home, that by being given responsibility at a critical moment and delivering results within a limited time frame significantly accelerated his development as an engineer.

The second was a manager who demonstrated impressive growth over the course of his assignment.

From the early stages, he approached his role with a strong desire to improve the working environment and strengthen the team.

As the engineer responsible for lithography, he returned early to IIM-1 and, just as he had confidently stated—""We have built a strong team and we will run lots as scheduled on April 1.""—We accomplished this and proudly carried out Japan's first EUV lithography exposure.

Beyond this technical achievement, he consistently recognized the contributions of those around him, saying, ""This success was made possible by the engineers from the equipment manufacturer and by team members who prioritized the analysis of our lots."" Through his deep engagement with the project, he grew into a leader who actively fosters collaboration and values the collective strength of the team.

Future Outlook and the Mindset Needed for Success

――What would you like to focus on going forward?

Our primary goal is to begin mass production of 2nm semiconductors in fiscal year 2027. Beyond that, we aim to connect this achievement to mass production of the next generation of semiconductors.

We have established a roadmap for the next ten years, but the challenge of racing against time never disappears.

IIM-1 is a fab that enables the world's fastest production of advanced semiconductors through AI. Leveraging this strength, we are considering the development of a Virtual Fabrication Process. By fully utilizing simulations to predict semiconductor performance before production, we expect to reduce production time by 30 to 40 percent. Our goal is to complete basic development within three years and achieve practical application within five years.

――What do you value most in developing engineers who succeeded in prototyping within such a short period?

Through the successful Soul Lot prototype and gaining certainty in 2nm production, I realized that miracles are not something that simply happens—they are created. And it was engineers with passionate commitment who created this miracle.

What must never be done in engineer development is damaging an engineer's confidence. Challenges inevitably bring failures, but if a supervisor criticizes an engineer by saying, ""Why can't you do this?"" the engineer becomes discouraged and stops taking on challenges.

Innovation is not driven by factories or equipment. Ultimately, it is driven by people—engineers.

――You seem to enjoy challenges. How do you maintain motivation? And how do you apply that to organizational management?

No matter how difficult the situation, you have to endure it, share the facts with your team with a smile and solve problems together. It is precisely because the situation is difficult that people grow, and that is what gives challenges their value.

I like the phrase, ""Do or do not. There is no try."" When you decide to do something, you commit to it and see it through to the end.

I want engineers to become people who can work—but not people whose lives are only about work. About 150 engineers were assigned to Albany. Including their families, roughly 500 people moved to the United States.

We are able to work with smiles because we have families who support us.

Rapidus can realize the convenient and prosperous future we envision thanks to engineers who absolutely never give up. Looking ahead toward mass production in 2027, we will continue advancing technology at extraordinary speed together with engineers who embody integrity, respect and perseverance.",https://www.rapidus.inc/wp/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/og.png,N,,2026-01-26 05:00:34.792037

What Is U.S. Bancorp's Investment Narrative?

To own U.S. Bancorp here, you really have to believe in a steady, relatively low‑drama banking story that combines disciplined lending with growing fee income. The Q4 and full‑year 2025 beat, together with management’s 2026 guidance, keeps near‑term catalysts centered on net interest income trends, fee growth and expense control, rather than any single “home run” initiative. The BTIG acquisition and the US$2.25 billion of new fixed‑to‑floating senior notes fit that script: they point to a bigger push into capital markets and a tidier balance sheet, but do not look like thesis‑changing moves on their own. The recent buybacks and dividend track record also reinforce the role of capital returns, while credit quality, funding costs and integration risk around BTIG remain the main things I’d watch from here.

But the BTIG deal brings a new kind of risk that investors should not ignore. U.S. Bancorp's shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 40%. Find out what it's worth.

The chatter began on Friday, when one of the many prediction models forecasters use showed a classic nor’easter: a storm that would take shape in the Gulf of Mexico, sweep across southern Georgia and hug the Atlantic Coast as it trekked north. The hypothetical simulation bore a striking resemblance to the “Storm of the Century” in 1993, which brought widespread heavy snow and paralyzed the East Coast for days.

But hold on a moment.

First, an explanation of how meteorologists build a forecast. There are two main computer models used around the world — the American (GFS) model and the European (ECMWF) model — that can visualize the overall weather pattern up to 14 days in advance. That far ahead, most of the information they spit out is hypothetical, though not always.

The storm showed up on several runs of the American model on Friday. By Saturday and Sunday, that same model failed to replicate the scenario. Other models, including the European one, began to hint at a similar system, but they placed it too far offshore to produce meaningful precipitation.

Dylan Lusk, a meteorologist with the Atlanta office of the National Weather Service, addressed the speculation on Saturday in his morning forecast. After giving a brief summary of the ice expected in his region this weekend, he turned to what he called his “favorite PSA.”

“Friends don’t let friends share single model runs of 10:1 snow totals 8 to 9 days out on social media,” he scolded. “From any model. Yes, I am judging you for posting that GFS run.”

Luke Culver, also with the Atlanta Weather Service office, expressed similar skepticism that afternoon: “Storm Threat Late Next Week? (Spoiler: Very Unlikely),” he wrote.

Mr. Culver, too, sought to tamp down online speculation:

“You may have heard about or seen posts on social media regarding a snow or winter weather threat in Georgia late next week or next weekend,” he wrote. “Well, at this time, that threat appears to be very low.”

But with Arctic air bringing usually cold temperatures across the South this week, forecasters acknowledge that the atmosphere is primed for more winter weather.

They are currently navigating what Eric Fisher, the chief meteorologist for WBZ-TV in Boston and an author of a book on major storms, called a “funnel” of uncertainty. Seven days out, meteorologists rely on pattern recognition to suggest what a storm is likely to do. As a storm draws closer — within 24 to 48 hours of arrival — and its specific physics become clearer, meteorologists can focus on the most likely scenarios.

For now, the only circumstance forecasters are confident about is the bitter cold that is settling in across the United States that will remain in place for days.

Freezing temperatures are the primary ingredient for winter weather, and they will be present across the Southeast. While Sunday’s model runs show weak signals for snow in cities from Atlanta to New York during the first two days of February, these models are outliers in what is otherwise a dry, cold outlook.

The takeaway: Be wary of the snowflake icons on your weather app seven days out, and be skeptical of social media posts that promise feet of snow a week in advance.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/25/arts/25winter-storm-future-storm/25winter-storm-future-storm-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 23:59:04.723585

Several high-profile voices are also explicitly framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination and collaboration, not just automation.

Humans& will need endless large sums of cash to fund the expensive endeavor that is training and scaling a new model.","AI chatbots are getting better at answering questions, summarizing documents, and solving mathematical equations, but they still largely behave like helpful assistants for one user at a time. They’re not designed to manage the messier work of real collaboration: coordinating people with competing priorities, tracking long-running decisions, and keeping teams aligned over time.

Humans&, a new startup founded by alumni of Anthropic, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Google DeepMind, thinks closing that gap is the next major frontier for foundation models. The company this week raised a $480 million seed round to build a “central nervous system” for the human-plus-AI economy. The startup’s “AI for empowering humans” framing has dominated early coverage, but the company’s actual ambition is more novel: building a new foundation model architecture designed for social intelligence, not just information retrieval or code generation.

“It feels like we’re ending the first paradigm of scaling, where question-answering models were trained to be very smart at particular verticals, and now we’re entering what we believe to be the second wave of adoption where the average consumer or user is trying to figure out what to do with all these things,” Andi Peng, one of humans&’s co-founders and a former Anthropic employee, told TechCrunch.

Humans&’s pitch centers on helping usher people into the new era of AI, moving beyond the narrative that AI will take their jobs. Whether or not that’s just marketing speak, the timing is critical: Companies are transitioning from chat to agents. Models are competent, but workflows aren’t, and the coordination challenge remains largely unaddressed. And through it all, people feel threatened and overwhelmed by AI.

The three-month-old company, like several of its peers, has managed to raise its startling seed round off the back of this philosophy and the pedigree of its founding team. Humans& still doesn’t have a product, nor has it been clear about what exactly it might be, though the team said it could be a replacement for multiplayer or multi-user contexts like communication platforms (think Slack) or collaboration platforms (think Google Docs and Notion). As for use cases and target audience, the team hinted at both enterprise and consumer applications.

“We are building a product and a model that is centered on communication and collaboration,” Eric Zelikman, co-founder and CEO of humans& and former xAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the focus is on getting the product to help people work together and communicate more effectively — both with each other and with AI tools.

“Like when you have to make a large group decision, often it comes down to someone taking everyone into one room, getting everyone to express their different camps about, for example, what kind of logo they’d like,” Zelikman continued, chortling with his team as they recalled the time-consuming tedium of getting everyone to agree on a logo for the startup.

Zelikman added that the new model will be trained to ask questions in a way that feels like interacting with a friend or a colleague, someone who is trying to get to know you. Chatbots today are programmed to ask questions constantly, but they do so without understanding the value of the question. He says this is because they’ve been optimized for two things: How much a user immediately likes a response they’re given, and how likely the model is to answer the question it receives correctly.

Part of the lack of clarity around what the product is could be that humans& doesn’t exactly have an answer for that yet. Peng said humans& is designing the product in conjunction with the model.

“Part of what we’re doing here is also making sure that as the model improves, we’re able to co-evolve the interface and the behaviors that the model is capable of into a product that makes sense,” she said.

What is clear, though, is that humans& isn’t trying to make a new model that can plug into existing applications and collaboration tools. The startup wants to own the collaboration layer.

AI plus team collaboration and productivity tools are an increasingly hot field — for example, the startup AI note-taking app Granola raised a $43 million round at a $250 million valuation as it launched more collaborative features. Several high-profile voices are also explicitly framing the next phase of AI as one of coordination and collaboration, not just automation. LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman today argued that companies are implementing AI wrong by treating it like isolated pilots and that the real leverage is in the coordination layer of work — that is, how teams share knowledge and run meetings.

“AI lives at the workflow level, and the people closest to the work know where the friction actually is,” Hoffman wrote on social media. “They’re the ones who will discover what should be automated, compressed, or totally redesigned.”

That’s the space where humans& wants to live. The idea is that its model-slash-product would act as the “connective tissue” across any organization — be it a 10,000-person business or a family — that understands the skills, motivations, and needs of each person, as well as how all of those can be balanced for the good of the whole.

To get there requires rethinking how AI models are trained.

“We’re trying to train the model in a different way that will involve more humans and AIs interacting and collaborating together,” Yuchen He, a humans& co-founder and former OpenAI researcher, told TechCrunch, adding that the startup’s model will also be trained using long-horizon and multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL).

Long-horizon RL is meant to train the model to plan, act, revise, and follow through over time, rather than just generate a good one-off answer. Multi-agent RL trains for environments where multiple AIs and/or humans are in the loop. Both of these concepts are gaining momentum in recent academic work as researchers push LLMs beyond chatbot responses toward systems that can coordinate actions and optimize outcomes over many steps.

“The model needs to remember things about itself, about you, and the better its memory, the better its user understanding,” He said.

Despite the stellar crew running the show, there are plenty of risks ahead. Humans& will need endless large sums of cash to fund the expensive endeavor that is training and scaling a new model. That means it will be competing with the major established players for resources, including access to compute.

The top risk, though, is that humans& isn’t just competing with the Notions and Slacks of the world. It’s coming for the Top Dogs of AI. And those companies are actively working on better ways to enable human collaboration on their platforms, even as they swear AGI will soon replace economically viable work. Through Claude Cowork, Anthropic aims to optimize work-style collaboration; Gemini is embedded into Workspace so AI-enabled collaboration is already happening inside the tools people are already using; and OpenAI has lately been pitching developers on its multi-agent orchestration and workflows.

Crucially, none of the major players seem poised to rewrite a model based on social intelligence, which either gives humans& a leg up or makes it an acquisition target. And with companies like Meta, OpenAI, and DeepMind on the prowl for top AI talent, M&A is certainly a risk.

Humans& told TechCrunch it has already turned away interested parties and is not interested in being acquired.

“We believe this is going to be a generational company, and we think that this has the potential to fundamentally change the future of how we interact with these models,” Zelikman said. “We trust ourselves to do that, and we have a lot of faith in the team that we’ve assembled here.”

Stocks are considered an inflation hedge.

It makes sense when you think about it.

Consumers and businesses experience inflation through the higher prices of goods and services. And those goods and services are sold by companies. And many of those companies comprise the publicly traded corporations listed on the stock market.

These companies aren’t always raising prices. But when they do, it’s because they believe it’ll support earnings growth. Often, the increase occurs in the context of passing on their own rising costs to their customers.

All this speaks to how companies have been dealing with tariffs. From Morgan Stanley’s Jan. 13 research note addressing tariff costs:

US Corporates Are Leveraging Pricing Power — Bullish for Earnings and Supportive of the Labor Market

Hidden in the depths of the Q3 US GDP print was evidence that firms are now starting to raise prices. The data in the GDP release is corroborated by data from the National Federation of Independent Businesses. We believe that companies are raising prices to pass through tariff costs to consumers rather than absorb a hit to margins. We view this as bullish for corporate earnings, while also reducing downside risk to labor markets.

This is consistent with what companies had been saying for much of last year.* And analysts expect margins to expand this year and earnings to grow at a double-digit rate through at least 2027. Notably, earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.

This dynamic between inflation and stock prices is not new.

Last October, Deutsche Bank published a study on asset prices over the past 200 years. They considered the relationship over 25-year periods. From the report:

Nominal equity returns rise almost linearly with inflation, suggesting that equities serve as an effective inflation hedge—particularly relative to cash. However, real returns tend to decline slightly as inflation increases, indicating that equities perform best in lower-inflation environments. Over a 25-year horizon though, the difference in real returns between moderate deflation (around 0% to -2% inflation) and fairly strong inflation (around 8–9%) is relatively small; the sharp decline occurs only at very high inflation levels.

Therefore, if you expect a structurally higher inflation regime ahead, equities should remain a reasonable good nominal hedge over the long run, with real returns likely to stay relatively well protected.

In the context of stocks acting as a hedge against inflation, the key finding here is that nominal returns have moved “almost linearly with inflation.” The fact that real returns (i.e., returns adjusted for inflation) have held up under most inflation scenarios is a bonus.

In the words of Ritholtz Wealth’s Ben Carlson, it’s a “pretty darn good long-term hedge to me.”

The big picture 🖼️

Publicly traded companies are not charities.

Their approach to pricing — whether it’s lowering them or raising them — is about maximizing earnings.

Sometimes that means raising prices on the goods and services they sell to you.

And you don’t have to like it.

But if you are invested in the stock market, you have exposure to the side that’s raising those prices.

-

*A popular reaction to the claim that tariffs have boosted prices is to ask, “Then why hasn’t inflation been higher?” While inflation rates have generally been steady, they remain above the Fed’s 2% target rate. We have to consider the possibility that inflation rates would be much lower if not for tariffs.

10 truths about the stock market 📈

🎲🎰 See me in Las Vegas!

I’ll be leading a breakout session at The MoneyShow TradersExpo in Las Vegas. The conference runs from Feb. 23 to 25. Sign up here!

Review of the macro crosscurrents 🔀

There were several notable data points and macroeconomic developments since our last review:

🎈 Inflation could be cooler. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index in November was up 2.8% from a year ago. The core PCE price index — the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation — was up 2.8% during the month, up from October’s 2.7% rate. While it’s above the Fed’s 2% target, it remains near its lowest level since March 2021.

On a month-over-month basis, the core PCE price index was up 0.16%. If you annualize the rolling three-month and six-month figures — a reflection of the near-term trend in prices — the core PCE price index was up 2.3% and 2.6%, respectively.

⛽️ Gas prices tick higher, but remain relatively low. From AAA: “As winter weather grips much of the nation and fewer drivers hit the road, gas prices remain low with the national average at $2.85. Gasoline demand is lowest during this time of year, keeping the price of crude oil in the high $50 – low $60 range. Demand begins to ramp up toward the end of February and early March as the weather starts getting milder, and travelers take Spring Break trips.”

🛍️ Consumer spending ticks higher. According to BEA data, personal consumption expenditures increased 0.5% month-over-month in November to an annual rate of $21.4 trillion, an all-time high.

Adjusted for inflation, real personal consumption expenditures increased 0.6% from the prior month to another all-time high.

💳 Card spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: “As of 16 Jan 2026, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 5.5% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 16 Jan 2026, our estimate of the US Census December control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.47%.“

From BofA: “Total card spending per HH was up 3.3% y/y in the week ending Jan 17, according to BAC aggregated credit & debit card data. Lodging & grocery saw the biggest rise in y/y spending growth since last week. Furniture & clothing saw the biggest decline. 2026 is off to a good start. Part of the uptick in spending may be driven by HHs anticipating larger tax refunds this year.“

Consumer spending data has looked a lot better than consumer sentiment readings. For more on this contradiction, read: We’re taking that vacation whether we like it or not 🛫 and Consumer finances remain in good shape 💵

👎 Consumer vibes remain poor, but improve marginally. From the University of Michigan’s January Surveys of Consumers: “While the overall improvement was small, it was broad based, seen across the income distribution, educational attainment, older and younger consumers, and Republicans and Democrats alike. However, national sentiment remains more than 20% below a year ago, as consumers continue to report pressures on their purchasing power stemming from high prices and the prospect of weakening labor markets. Aside from tariff policy, consumers do not appear to be connecting foreign developments to their views of the economy.”

💼 New unemployment insurance claims remain low, total ongoing claims decline. Initial claims for unemployment benefits rose marginally to 200,000 during the week ending Jan. 17, up from 199,000 the week prior. This metric remains at levels historically associated with economic growth.

Insured unemployment, which captures those who continue to claim unemployment benefits, declined to 1.845 million during the week ending Jan. 10.

👎 Job growth has been lackluster. According to payroll processor ADP, private U.S. employers added 8,000 jobs in the four weeks ending Dec. 27.

🔨 Construction spending ticked higher. Construction spending increased 0.5% to an annual rate of $2.175 trillion in October.

🏠 Mortgage rates tick higher. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.09%, up from 6.06% last week: “With the economy improving and the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage nearly a percentage point lower than last year, more homebuyers are entering the market. Buyers always should shop around for the best rate, as multiple quotes can potentially save them thousands.”

As of Q3, there were 148.3 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.9 million were owner-occupied and about 40% were mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to the small weekly movements in home prices or mortgage rates.

For more on mortgages and home prices, read: Why home prices and rents are creating all sorts of confusion about inflation 😖

👎 Activity survey signals growth. From S&P Global’s January U.S. PMI report: “The survey is signalling annualised GDP growth of 1.5% for both December and January, and a worryingly subdued rate of new business growth across both manufacturing and services adds further to signs that first quarter growth could disappoint. Jobs growth is meanwhile already disappointing, with near stagnant payroll numbers reported again in January, as businesses worry about taking on more staff in an environment of uncertainty, weak demand and high costs. Increased costs, widely blamed on tariffs, are again cited as a key driver of higher prices for both goods and services in January, meaning inflation and affordability remains a widespread concern among businesses.”

Keep in mind that during times of perceived stress, soft survey data tends to be more exaggerated than actual hard data.

Putting it all together 📋

Earnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.

Demand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, although cooling, appears to be modestly positive, and the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.

But growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less “coiled” these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.

Actions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.

Stocks are not the economy: There’s a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy in the near term, thanks largely to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.

Mind the ever-present risks: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about, such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, and cyber attacks. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.

Investing is never a smooth ride: There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.

Think long-term: For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.

Key insights about the stock market 📈

Here’s a roundup of some of TKer’s most talked-about paid and free newsletters about the stock market. All of the headlines are hyperlinked to the archived pieces.

10 truths about the stock market 📈

The stock market can be an intimidating place: It’s real money on the line, there’s an overwhelming amount of information, and people have lost fortunes in it very quickly. But it’s also a place where thoughtful investors have long accumulated a lot of wealth. The primary difference between those two outlooks is related to misconceptions about the stock market that can lead people to make poor investment decisions.

The makeup of the S&P 500 is constantly changing 🔀

Passive investing is a concept usually associated with buying and holding a fund that tracks an index. And no passive investment strategy has attracted as much attention as buying an S&P 500 index fund. However, the S&P 500 — an index of 500 of the largest U.S. companies — is anything but a static set of 500 stocks.

The key driver of stock prices: Earnings💰

For investors, anything you can ever learn about a company matters only if it also tells you something about earnings. That’s because long-term moves in a stock can ultimately be explained by the underlying company’s earnings, expectations for earnings, and uncertainty about those expectations for earnings. Over time, the relationship between stock prices and earnings has a very tight statistical relationship.

Stomach-churning stock market sell-offs are normal🎢

Investors should always be mentally prepared for some big sell-offs in the stock market. It’s part of the deal when you invest in an asset class that is sensitive to the constant flow of good and bad news. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has seen an average annual max drawdown (i.e., the biggest intra-year sell-off) of 14%.

How the stock market performed around recessions 📉📈

Every recession in history was different. And the range of stock performance around them varied greatly. There are two things worth noting. First, recessions have always been accompanied by a significant drawdown in stock prices. Second, the stock market bottomed and inflected upward long before recessions ended.

In the stock market, time pays ⏳

Since 1928, the S&P 500 has generated a positive total return more than 89% of the time over all five-year periods. Those are pretty good odds. When you extend the timeframe to 20 years, you’ll see that there’s never been a period where the S&P 500 didn’t generate a positive return.

What a strong dollar means for stocks 👑

While a strong dollar may be great news for Americans vacationing abroad and U.S. businesses importing goods from overseas, it’s a headwind for multinational U.S.-based corporations doing business in non-U.S. markets.

Stanley Druckenmiller's No. 1 piece of advice for novice investors 🧐

…you don't want to buy them when earnings are great, because what are they doing when their earnings are great? They go out and expand capacity. Three or four years later, there's overcapacity and they're losing money. What about when they're losing money? Well, then they’ve stopped building capacity. So three or four years later, capacity will have shrunk and their profit margins will be way up. So, you always have to sort of imagine the world the way it's going to be in 18 to 24 months as opposed to now. If you buy it now, you're buying into every single fad every single moment. Whereas if you envision the future, you're trying to imagine how that might be reflected differently in security prices.

Peter Lynch made a remarkably prescient market observation in 1994 🎯

Some event will come out of left field, and the market will go down, or the market will go up. Volatility will occur. Markets will continue to have these ups and downs. … Basic corporate profits have grown about 8% a year historically. So, corporate profits double about every nine years. The stock market ought to double about every nine years… The next 500 points, the next 600 points — I don’t know which way they’ll go… They’ll double again in eight or nine years after that. Because profits go up 8% a year, and stocks will follow. That's all there is to it.

Warren Buffett's 'fourth law of motion' 📉

Long ago, Sir Isaac Newton gave us three laws of motion, which were the work of genius. But Sir Isaac’s talents didn’t extend to investing: He lost a bundle in the South Sea Bubble, explaining later, “I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men.” If he had not been traumatized by this loss, Sir Isaac might well have gone on to discover the Fourth Law of Motion: For investors as a whole, returns decrease as motion increases.

Most pros can’t beat the market 🥊

According to S&P Dow Jones Indices (SPDJI), 65% of U.S. large-cap equity fund managers underperformed the S&P 500 in 2024. As you stretch the time horizon, the numbers get even more dismal. Over three years, 85% underperformed. Over 10 years, 90% underperformed. And over 20 years, 92% underperformed. This 2023 performance follows 14 consecutive years in which the majority of fund managers in this category have lagged the index.

Proof that 'past performance is no guarantee of future results' 📊

Even if you are a fund manager who generated industry-leading returns in one year, history says it’s an almost insurmountable task to stay on top consistently in subsequent years. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, just 4.21% of all U.S. equity funds in the top half of performance during the first year were able to remain in the top during the four subsequent years. Only 2.42% of U.S. large-cap funds remained in the top half

SPDJI’s report also considered fund performance relative to their benchmarks over the past three years. Of 738 U.S. large-cap equity funds tracked by SPDJI, 50.68% beat the S&P 500 in 2022. Just 5.08% beat the S&P in the two years ending 2023. And only 2.14% of the funds beat the index over the three years ending in 2024.

The odds are stacked against stock pickers 🎲

Picking stocks in an attempt to beat market averages is an incredibly challenging and sometimes money-losing effort. Most professional stock pickers aren’t able to do this consistently. One of the reasons for this is that most stocks don’t deliver above-average returns. According to S&P Dow Jones Indices, only 19% of the stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the average stock’s return from 2001 to 2025. Over this period, the average return on an S&P 500 stock was 452%, while the median stock rose by just 59%.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MfOx!,w_1200,h_675,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa6a26a81-511f-4644-a168-6369eaa59c16_2426x1666.png",N,,2026-01-26 03:00:36.033334

Each Stargate site receives a community plan tailored to local needs

Cloud hosting and web hosting can benefit from predictable operational energy costs

OpenAI has unveiled a plan aimed at limiting the impact of its Stargate data centers on local electricity costs.

The new guidelines will see each site will operate under a community plan developed with input from residents and regulators.

This approach includes funding new power and storage infrastructure directly or investing in energy generation and transmission resources as needed.

Electricity investments aim to ease local energy strain

The goal is to ensure that local utility bills do not rise due to the operations of these large-scale data centers.

The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion, multi-year program to build AI data centers across the United States to support both AI training and inference workloads and handle some of the most demanding computational tasks in the industry.

OpenAI’s efforts mirror moves by other technology firms, such as Microsoft, which recently announced measures to reduce water usage and limit electricity cost impacts at its own data centers.

By funding energy infrastructure and working closely with local utilities, these companies aim to prevent added financial burdens on surrounding communities.

Each Stargate site will have a tailored plan that reflects the specific energy requirements of its location.

This could involve funding the installation of additional energy storage systems or expanding local generation capacity.

OpenAI claims it will fully cover energy costs resulting from its operations rather than passing them on to residents or businesses.

Cloud hosting and web hosting at these sites should benefit from predictable operating costs, while AI tools can run at scale without disrupting local infrastructure.

Reports indicate AI-driven data centers could nearly triple electricity demand in the United States by 2035, placing strain on regional power grids and pushing utility bills higher for consumers.

US lawmakers have criticized tech companies for relying on public utilities while residential and small business customers absorb the cost of grid upgrades.

Volatile demand from AI workloads, such as running large language models or other cloud-based AI services, further complicates energy planning.

Without proactive investment, electricity costs could rise sharply in regions that host multiple data centers.

OpenAI’s community plan also reflects the growing challenge of energy access for AI development.

Large-scale AI tools consume far more power than typical cloud services or web hosting workloads, making infrastructure planning essential.

By directly funding energy improvements and coordinating with local utilities, OpenAI aims to reduce risks to both the power grid and nearby communities.

Across the industry, a quiet tokenization wave is already reshaping how investors access private markets.

Still, its early entry into the tokenized‑equity space reflects a broader momentum that Forbes and others have begun to track as private‑equity giants experiment with tokenized funds and secondary liquidity.","As late-stage private giants stay off the public markets, a new class of tokenized products is emerging to give investors indirect exposure to the world’s most valuable startups.

In the 1980s, startups raced to ring the bell. In the 2010s, they raced to stay private. Today, they’re racing to tokenize and that shift could decide who gets into the next era of wealth creation, and who is left watching from the sidelines.

For decades, the IPO marked the moment a company “made it” from the passage from private innovation to public participation. Then cheap money and deep private markets changed the script. From 2012 to 2022, global private‑equity assets under management more than tripled to over $13.4 trillion, concentrating enormous financial clout in illiquid private companies.

That evolution has created a stark access gap. On one side: institutions and insiders with allocations into late‑stage giants like SpaceX and OpenAI. On the other: everyday investors locked out of the growth curve until much later, if ever. Private‑equity markets now run into the tens of trillions globally, yet only a tiny sliver is accessible via tokenized products, underscoring how early this market still is.

Some builders are now trying to turn that access gap itself into an index: a single instrument tied to a basket of late‑stage private tech companies worth more than $100 billion each. One emerging idea is to treat these giants as an indexable category, bundling exposure to several of them into a single tokenized product; Hecto Finance is one of the more aggressive experiments in that direction, testing a pre‑launch index built around a small set of these so‑called “Hectocorns.”

“We used to talk about unicorns, then decacorns,” says CEO Ultan Miller. “Now we’re in a world of $100 billion private companies and most people still can’t participate in their value.”

The Rise of the Hectocorns

Just as FAANG stocks once symbolized the dominance of public tech equities, a new informal club is taking shape behind the scenes. Call them the Hectocorns, OpenAI, SpaceX, ByteDance, Stripe, xAI and Anthropic, all privately held firms that have surpassed or are widely reported to be approaching $100 billion valuations without going public.

“Founders today don’t need to go public to scale. They can raise tens of billions privately while maintaining control,” says Miller. “For many, public markets are no longer where you go to grow; they’re where you go to exit.”

That inversion, public markets as endgame, not launchpad, is what Hecto is trying to price into a single instrument. Rather than betting on one name, the project aims to build a diversified, tokenized index that captures exposure to top private firms before they list.

A Structural Innovation, Not a Speculative One

Hecto Finance isn’t pitching a meme coin here. It is designing a regulated index product, with exposure built through tools like direct equity, forwards and total‑return swaps, all which are administered on Canton, a privacy‑focused blockchain backed by institutions including Goldman Sachs, Citadel Securities and HSBC.

The token is planned as a security offering under Dubai’s VARA framework, with the team aiming for distribution across both crypto exchanges and, eventually, traditional brokerages. Miller’s wager is that the infrastructure for global, compliant securities distribution has finally matured at the same time as investor appetite for high‑growth private equity has gone mainstream.

“The moment it clicked for me was getting offered a co‑investment in OpenAI—opaque fees, messy structure, and I still felt lucky,” Miller recalls. “Most people never get that text message. Tokenization, done right, is how we change that.”

The Quiet Tokenization Wave

Hecto’s strategy doesn’t emerge in a vacuum. Across the industry, a quiet tokenization wave is already reshaping how investors access private markets.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has publicly described tokenization as “the next generation for markets,” and the first wave has largely centered on real‑world assets like Treasuries, credit and real estate, where fractional ownership structures pair blockchain rails with regulated wrappers.

On the private‑equity side, companies like Securitize have partnered with managers including KKR, BlackRock, Apollo and Hamilton Lane to tokenize interests in private funds, presenting tokenization as a way to “democratize capital markets by making them more accessible, transparent and efficient.” Its launch of tokenized feeder structures for flagship strategies marked some of the earliest large‑scale institutional tokenization efforts in private markets.

In Singapore, ADDX CEO Oi‑Yee Choo has argued that tokenisation can “democratise access to private investments” by cutting minimum tickets from around $1 million to as low as roughly $5,000 equivalent and automating issuance, custody and secondary trading for accredited investors across more than 30 jurisdictions.

Ondo Finance, which focuses on tokenized securities like Treasuries, has framed tokenized assets as part of a broader “transformation for financial assets.” In a public letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in October last year, it urged regulators to adopt a “same activity, same risk, same regulatory outcome” framework rather than treat tokenized assets as a separate category, a stance that helped validate tokenized Treasuries and credit as viable on‑chain products as the SEC closed a probe into the project.

Other regions are taking a similar approach, with the recently announced amendments from South Korea’s National Assembly to the Capital Markets Act and the Electronic Securities Act, Singapore regulating tokenized assets under the Securities and Futures Act (SFA), Hong Kong integrating tokenization into its traditional securities framework under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO) and Japan regulating tokenized securities under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA).

While Hecto targets the high‑risk, high‑reward world of pre‑IPO giants, this infrastructure layer has already reached operational scale. Securitize runs a regulated stack of tokenized funds with blue‑chip partners; ADDX serves accredited investors across Asia; and Ondo has obtained U.S. registrations as it builds a network for tokenized Treasuries and securities. Together, they show that compliant, liquid tokenized securities can work, so far with mostly bonds, credit and diversified funds. The leap to late‑stage private equity introduces harder questions about cap tables, transfer restrictions and what it really means to “own” a pre‑IPO share onchain.

Despite real‑world assets totaling approximately $18–34 billion on‑chain in 2025, tokenized private‑equity exposure remains a tiny fraction of a multi‑trillion‑dollar PE market—underscoring how early experiments like Hecto still are. Analysts now routinely project tokenized assets could reach $2–4 trillion by 2030 in base‑case scenarios, with more aggressive estimates ranging much higher depending on regulation and infrastructure.

The Case for Access — and the Caveats

The upside is obvious: tokenization could unlock global access to an asset class historically reserved for pension funds, elite venture firms, family offices and sovereign wealth funds. Trillions of dollars in private markets sit structurally out of reach for ordinary investors; whoever cracks compliant, liquid exposure to late‑stage private equity will help redraw the line between “Wall Street” and everyone else.

But the risks are real. Pre‑IPO equity is illiquid, often highly concentrated, and legally complex. Tokenized exposure must grapple with custody, compliance and settlement—plus the reality that many jurisdictions still lack clear rules for secondary trading of security tokens. And if a structure fails, the question of who truly holds the bag: token holder, intermediary or issuer, remains largely untested in court.

Miller argues that’s precisely why the infrastructure needs to be designed with regulation in mind, not added later.

“We’re not just building for crypto‑native investors. We’re building for a future where a 23‑year‑old in Jakarta can access the same pre‑IPO exposure as a fund manager in Zurich,” he says. “But we only get there by embedding compliance into every layer—tech, legal, operational.”

To that end, Hecto plans to publish cryptographic proof of reserves and is exploring dual issuance under both VARA and a major European regulator to support cross‑border distribution.

A Generational Shift in What Gets Indexed

Beyond the plumbing, Hecto is tapping into a broader cultural shift. For much of the 20th century, innovation was measured by public stock tickers. Today, many of the companies shaping AI, fintech, space and digital infrastructure are years, or decades, from IPO.

“Each generation has its defining asset class,” says Miller. “In the 80s it was equities. In the 2000s, tech IPOs. In the 2010s, crypto. The 2020s could be defined by tokenized pre‑IPO access—where value is created before it’s public, and ownership starts earlier.”

Hecto Finance remains early‑stage, with a waitlist of over 25k people. No token has launched, no assets are held on‑chain, and the company has not yet disclosed its cap table or full go‑to‑market roadmap. Still, its early entry into the tokenized‑equity space reflects a broader momentum that Forbes and others have begun to track as private‑equity giants experiment with tokenized funds and secondary liquidity.

Whether Hecto or another player gets there first, the direction of travel is clear: more of the growth curve is happening off‑exchange, and investors, and regulators, are searching for a way in. If it works, Hecto won’t just give investors a new way into the next generation of great companies. It may blur the line between “private” and “public” so thoroughly that, by the time a ticker finally appears on screen, most of the real action will already have happened.

Continued resilience of growth to geopolitical developments is not guaranteed. S&P Global continues to expect slowdowns in China, India, Canada, Brazil, the eurozone and the UK in 2026.

One escalating concern is that developments that S&P Global would have previously considered to be ‘tail’ risks—for example, US-European Union (EU) tensions over Greenland—have become more probable. Another is the US administration introducing another layer of tariffs to those ‘doing business’ with Iran.

At the same time, the artificial intelligence (AI)-spending-related boost to growth could be giving a misleading impression of how resilient economic conditions would be to additional adverse shocks, S&P Global Market Intelligence said in a note.

The near-term prospects for commodity and ?nancial markets have become more uncertain accordingly and, in the case of the recent rise in crude oil prices, run counter to some key aspects of S&P Global’s predictions for 2026—namely, supply-driven oil price declines leaning down on in?ation rates, extending monetary policy easing cycles and supporting growth.

While our forecasts did not change materially in January’s update, S&P Global continues to expect slowdowns in China, India, Canada, Brazil, the eurozone and the United Kingdom this year.

National growth prospects differ, as do some of their drivers, although there are some common factors contributing to the expected slowdowns. Most are trade-related, including unfavourable base effects stemming from 2025’s tariff front-loading.

S&P Global’s purchasing managers indices (PMIs) have already shown some loss of momentum. While there were ups and downs over the course of 2025, the global composite index generally remained indicative of near-potential global real GDP growth.

Output expectations have been persistently weak, although this was not exerting a signi?cant drag on current activity. December 2025’s PMI data showed some tentative signs that this might be changing for the worse.

However, the stocks have been on two different paths lately.

If you're interested in investing in a retail stock and have to choose between the two for the long haul, Walmart stands out as the better choice.

Walmart has a few advantages over Target when it comes to long-term success. First, it has always positioned itself as the place to go for value and bargains, helping it cater to lower-income and budget-conscious shoppers. This helps Walmart thrive in both a thriving and a slumping economy.

Target, on the other hand, has positioned itself as a more premium brand, and many of its prices reflect that. If money is tight, consumers have no issue skipping Target and heading to Walmart for deals.

Target also can't compete with Walmart's overall reach. It has over 5,200 U.S. stores, compared to Target's roughly 2,000.

Will Earnings Upside and Aggressive Buybacks Change Medpace Holdings' (MEDP) Capital Allocation Narrative?

January 25, 2026

In its fourth-quarter 2025 investor letter, Vulcan Value Partners highlighted Medpace Holdings’ strong free cash flow, solid balance sheet, and management quality, following an earnings report that surprised Wall Street with faster growth.

The letter also underscored Medpace’s active share repurchase program, including buying back more than 8% of its shares at what Vulcan viewed as attractive valuations, illustrating how capital allocation is shaping the company’s profile for long-term shareholders.

Next, we’ll examine how this combination of earnings upside and disciplined share repurchases influences Medpace’s broader investment narrative.

What Is Medpace Holdings' Investment Narrative?

For Medpace, the big-picture belief is that its focused contract research model, strong free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation can keep compounding value in a competitive CRO market. Vulcan Value Partners’ recent letter reinforces that story, highlighting robust cash generation, a solid balance sheet and management that is willing to buy back more than 8% of the company at what it views as attractive prices. That kind of repurchase activity, on top of earnings that recently surprised Wall Street, increases the near term catalyst around capital allocation and any further upside surprises in bookings or margins when Q4 2025 results land on February 9. At the same time, after a very strong share price run and insider selling, valuation risk and expectations risk feel more front and center than before.

However, investors also need to weigh how richer expectations could magnify any disappointment. Despite retreating, Medpace Holdings' shares might still be trading 20% above their fair value. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Twelve Simply Wall St Community estimates span roughly US$288 to almost US$733 per share, underscoring very different views. Set against Medpace’s buyback-fueled momentum, this spread invites you to weigh capital allocation benefits against rising expectations risk.

- why the stock might be worth as much as 25% more than the current price!

Lawmakers’ blueprint—stress tests, oversight of third parties, and clear rules—aims to fortify the system without stifling growth, positioning Britain as a leader in responsible fintech.","LONDON—Britain’s financial regulators face mounting pressure to overhaul their approach to artificial intelligence after a parliamentary panel warned that the current “wait and see” stance exposes consumers and markets to serious harm. The Treasury Committee’s report, released January 20, 2026, calls for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Bank of England (BoE) to launch AI-specific stress tests, designed to simulate market shocks triggered by automated systems.

“Based on the evidence I’ve seen, I do not feel confident that our financial system is prepared if there was a major AI-related incident and that is worrying,” said Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Treasury Committee, in a statement quoted by Reuters. The report highlights that about three-quarters of British financial firms now deploy AI in core operations, from insurance claims processing to credit assessments, amplifying risks like opaque decision-making and algorithmic exclusion of vulnerable customers.

Experts testifying before the committee pointed to threats from heavy reliance on a handful of U.S. tech giants for AI and cloud services, warning that outages—such as the October 2025 Amazon Web Services disruption affecting banks like Lloyds—could cascade into systemic failures. AI-driven trading could exacerbate “herding behaviour,” where imitative decisions amplify market crashes, the panel noted.

Treasury Committee Targets Regulatory Gaps

The cross-party group criticized the FCA, BoE, and HM Treasury for inadequate oversight, urging the FCA to issue guidance by the end of 2026 on applying consumer protection rules to AI and clarifying senior managers’ responsibilities for understanding these systems. “By taking a wait-and-see approach to AI in financial services, the three authorities are exposing consumers and the financial system to potentially serious harm,” the report stated, as covered by The Guardian.

Firms struggle with AI’s “lack of explainability,” conflicting with requirements for executives to control risks, according to trade group Innovate Finance’s testimony reported by The Register. The committee also slammed delays in implementing the Critical Third Parties (CTP) regime, introduced in January 2025, which empowers regulators to oversee non-financial providers like AI and cloud firms. “Over a year since the regime was established, it is not clear to us why HM Treasury has been so slow,” the report said.

The FCA, which has resisted AI-specific rules due to technology’s rapid evolution, plans to review the recommendations. A spokesperson told The Paypers the regulator welcomes the focus but favors principles-based oversight. The BoE, meanwhile, has assessed AI risks and will respond formally.

Agentic AI Emerges as New Threat

A race among banks to adopt “agentic AI”—systems that autonomously make decisions, unlike basic generative models—poses fresh dangers to retail customers, the FCA warned Reuters late last year. This shift from chatbots to operational influencers in lending and fraud detection raises concerns over “black box” outcomes hard to challenge, potentially discriminating against vulnerable groups.

Fraud risks and unregulated advice from AI chatbots compound consumer perils, while financial stability hangs on diversified infrastructure. “If something has gone wrong in the system, that could have a very big impact on the consumer,” Hillier told Reuters. The report advocates incorporating AI scenarios into system-wide stress tests to probe resilience.

In parallel, HM Treasury appointed Starling Bank CIO Harriet Rees and Lloyds Banking Group’s Rohit Dhawan as unpaid “AI Champions” on January 20, 2026, to guide safe adoption, as announced via government channels and echoed in Ground News aggregation.

Global Echoes and Industry Pushback

The UK push mirrors international concerns, with India’s RBI voicing similar AI governance needs in financial services, per Economic Times BFSI. Jonathan Hall, BoE Financial Policy Committee member, endorsed tailored AI stress tests to spot risks early, cited in coverage by MEXC News.

Industry voices like EY’s Preetham Peddanagari stress defined regulation for competitiveness, as noted by Mortgage Strategy. The FCA’s existing tools, including its April 2025 AI live testing service and a planned June 2025 code with the Information Commissioner’s Office, represent steps forward but fall short of lawmakers’ demands.

Financial services, a cornerstone of the UK economy, must balance innovation with safeguards. The Treasury Committee insists proactive measures, including designating AI providers under CTP by year-end, to avert crises where tech failures morph into economic shocks, drawing from TechRepublic.

Path Forward for Regulators

The BoE’s Financial Policy Committee should monitor CTP progress and recommend acceleration if needed, the report urges. With no dedicated AI laws, reliance on legacy rules leaves gaps, especially as 75% of firms embed AI deeper than other sectors.

David Geale, FCA Executive Director for Payments and Digital Finance, emphasized individual accountability for AI-induced harm, yet committee evidence reveals governance shortfalls. Upcoming FCA guidance could bridge this, mandating executive AI literacy.

Carrier underwriting tightening is likely to remain part of the insurance landscape as insurers adapt to evolving risks.","Underwriting decisions today are influenced by broader market conditions, long-term loss patterns, and forward-looking risk models. These changes are structural, not temporary”

— Dan Burghardt

METAIRIE, LA, UNITED STATES, January 9, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — Insurance markets across the Gulf South are undergoing notable shifts as carriers adjust underwriting standards in response to changing risk conditions. Underwriting tightening refers to a more conservative approach insurers take when evaluating applications, renewals, and coverage terms. These changes affect how policies are written, priced, and maintained, particularly in regions exposed to weather-related and property risks.

Underwriting guidelines serve as the framework carriers use to assess risk. When those guidelines tighten, insurers may require more detailed property information, limit coverage options, increase deductibles, or decline certain risks altogether. These adjustments are often driven by loss history, reinsurance costs, regulatory pressures, and broader economic conditions rather than individual policyholder behavior.

In recent years, carriers operating in Louisiana and Mississippi have faced increased claims activity related to hurricanes, flooding, wind damage, and secondary losses such as water intrusion and mold. Even properties that have not experienced direct losses can be affected, as underwriting decisions are often made using regional data and modeling rather than isolated histories.

One of the most visible effects of underwriting tightening is increased scrutiny during renewals. Carriers may request updated property inspections, roof age documentation, mitigation details, or confirmation of building materials. Properties with older roofs, outdated systems, or deferred maintenance may encounter coverage restrictions or non-renewal notices as carriers attempt to limit exposure.

Another common outcome involves changes to deductibles and policy terms. Higher wind or named-storm deductibles have become more frequent, particularly in coastal and near-coastal areas. In some cases, coverage limits may be adjusted or endorsements added to clarify exclusions that were previously broader in scope.

Underwriting tightening also affects new policy applications. Certain property types, construction styles, or geographic zones may face limited carrier availability. This can result in fewer options for placement and longer processing times as carriers evaluate submissions more carefully. Documentation accuracy becomes increasingly important in these conditions, as incomplete or inconsistent information can delay decisions or lead to declinations.

Commercial policies are similarly impacted. Businesses may see changes in property valuations, occupancy classifications, or risk control requirements. Carriers may require updated appraisals, loss control recommendations, or operational details to better understand exposure. These steps reflect an effort to align coverage with actual risk rather than assumptions made years earlier.

According to Dan Burghardt, owner of Dan Burghardt Insurance, underwriting tightening has become a defining characteristic of the current insurance environment.

“Carriers are reevaluating how risk is measured and priced,” said Burghardt. “Underwriting decisions today are influenced by broader market conditions, long-term loss patterns, and forward-looking risk models. These changes are structural, not temporary.”

Burghardt noted that policyholders often first encounter underwriting tightening through renewal changes rather than initial applications. “Renewals that look different from prior years are becoming more common. Increased documentation requests or adjusted terms usually reflect carrier-wide guideline changes rather than individual account issues,” he said.

Geographic considerations play a major role in underwriting decisions. Areas with repeated storm activity, flood exposure, or aging infrastructure tend to experience tighter standards more quickly. This includes many communities throughout Southeast Louisiana and coastal Mississippi, where insurers must balance continued participation with long-term sustainability.

After more than four decades of operation, Dan Burghardt Insurance has observed multiple market cycles. Over that time, the agency has grown to be licensed in both Louisiana and Mississippi while maintaining a strong focus on communities including New Orleans, Metairie, Kenner, Gretna, St. Bernard, Slidell, Mandeville, Covington, Baton Rouge, Hammond, Houma, Thibodaux, LaPlace, Lake Charles, Bossier City, Central, Lafayette, Monroe, Shreveport, and Alexandria.

These regional patterns highlight why underwriting tightening often feels uneven. One area may see limited disruption, while another experiences significant carrier pullback. The variation reflects how insurers apply models to localized data, sometimes resulting in different outcomes across relatively short distances.

Understanding underwriting tightening helps set realistic expectations. Policyholders who recognize these trends are better prepared for documentation requests, inspections, or policy adjustments. Clear records, updated maintenance, and accurate property details support smoother underwriting reviews, even as standards become more restrictive.

Carrier underwriting tightening is likely to remain part of the insurance landscape as insurers adapt to evolving risks. While guidelines may continue to shift, awareness of the underlying factors provides context for changes that might otherwise seem abrupt. In a constrained market, understanding how and why underwriting decisions are made becomes an essential part of managing coverage continuity and long-term planning.

Pooja Dhingra and Palak Shah have both carved their unique paths to success, asserting themselves in fields where few dared to tread. Their stories exemplify the power of vision, determination, and a willingness to push boundaries. They are both part of the coveted Forbes India under 30 alumni, a testament to their achievements and influence.

""It was never just about the macarons; it was about proving that a dream can reshape an entire industry,"" shares Pooja Dhingra, the founder of Le15 Patisserie, brought a taste of Paris to Mumbai with her macarons, an idea that took root during her time in France. She broke away from the conventional path when she left law school to pursue her love for desserts. She defied societal norms of following a 'safer' career path, choosing to enter a bold industry often considered unconventional for women. After realizing that India lacked the delicacies she had come to love abroad, she set out to change that, overcoming the challenges posed by local ingredients and climate.

Her success didn’t come overnight; it took years of innovation, blending international techniques with local elements. Today, Dhingra is a pioneer in the Indian patisserie industry, growing her business with passion and precision, and setting the standard for aspiring entrepreneurs. Ms Dhingra proved that innovation and persistence can overcome obstacles.

""For me, it was about honoring tradition while simultaneously evolving it for the modern world,"" remarks Palak Shah, who stepped into her family’s traditional textile business but redefined its direction with her brand Ekaya. Shah challenged the conventional role women were expected to play, turning her vision into a thriving business that merged heritage with modernity.

Rather than simply continuing the legacy, she transformed it by bringing Indian handloom into the global fashion space. Her vision allowed her to step beyond expectations, facilitating collaborations with leading designers and creating contemporary collections that made heritage textiles relevant in modern wardrobes. Her outfit has managed to deliver output that is both timeless and modern in equal measure.

Both women have not only achieved success but have also created spaces where others can thrive. They defied convention, trusted their instincts, and followed their passions, proving that perseverance and innovation are the keys to longevity in competitive industries. While their paths were different, the driving force behind their success was the same: an unwavering belief in their ability to shape their future.

Their journeys reflect a shared belief that success comes from doing what is right for oneself, regardless of convention. L'Oréal Paris, along with Forbes India, celebrates the journey of these enterprising women. As they continue to grow their ventures, they remind us that no matter what choices we make, we are worth it.

Recent collaborations in autoimmune disease and oncology, along with preliminary fourth quarter revenue reported above guidance, have coincided with a sharp rebound in sentiment. The 30 day share price return is 35.72% and the 1 year total shareholder return is 51.11%, even though the 3 year and 5 year total shareholder returns of 54.00% and 86.92% respectively indicate a much weaker longer term record.

If this kind of research driven story interests you, it could be a good moment to widen the net and look at as potential ideas to research next.

After reaching a 52-week high, delivering a 51.11% 1-year total return, and reporting revenue of about US$642.8 million alongside a US$76.32 million loss, is 10x Genomics still underappreciated, or are markets already pricing in years of future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 22.8% Overvalued

With 10x Genomics last closing at $22.38 and the most followed fair value sitting at about $18.23, the narrative is clearly more cautious than the market.

The acquisition of Scale Biosciences broadens 10x Genomics' technical capabilities in single cell analysis, allowing integration of foundational innovations like combinatorial indexing and quantum barcoding, which may accelerate innovation, reduce costs, and open up new high value markets, positively impacting future revenue growth and margins.

Want to see what kind of growth and margin profile has to line up for that fair value? The narrative connects modest top line expansion with a very different earnings picture and a specific future earnings multiple. Curious how those ingredients combine to imply a lower value than today?

Result: Fair Value of $18.23 (OVERVALUED)

However, it is still worth remembering that softer 2026 outlooks across the tools group and ongoing operating losses could quickly challenge expectations if demand or margins disappoint.

Another Angle On Valuation

On simple price targets, 10x Genomics looks 22.8% above the US$18.23 fair value implied by the consensus narrative. Yet on a P/S of 4.4x, it trades below peers at 5.6x, although above the 3.5x fair ratio that our model suggests the market could gravitate toward. Is that a margin of safety or a warning sign if sentiment cools?

This isn't the first Nvidia Arm chip, since the Switch and the Switch 2 already use them.","Hi, hello, and welcome to a new edition of the overkill digest newsletter.

First things first, some housecleaning:

I'm slowly moving this website from Ghost to Kirby and Buttondown. Ghost is great, but it's limiting for what I want to do. Kirby is fully modular and, combined with Buttondown, lets me do some cool things. My personal blog runs on Kirby, too.

Using Buttondown for mailing also saves me around $350 a year. And since I don't run ads or other income here (Ko-Fi is the only money I accept for overkill), saving money is always welcome!

Another reason is that I want to write more during the week. I often hold thoughts for this newsletter, but I could publish them during the week and then pull them into the email. With Kirby and Buttondown, I can automate that workflow.

The switch to Kirby will take at least a few months. There will be a full redesign and, knowing me, a lot of custom development.

But I decided not to wait to start my ""link blogging"" (if you never heard of that term, read this). Instead, I'm doing it now on overkill. Here's what that means:

Whenever I find something interesting, I'll write a link post. You can read them on the website, via RSS, or on Bluesky or Mastodon.

My longer posts, be it a review, a guide, or an opinion piece, will appear on social and RSS, and I'll also share them via email to people signed up for the Full Feed list.

overkill digest still goes out every Sunday. It'll include that week's link posts, longer posts, weekly updates on what I'm up to, and the occasional extra commentary. The layout will change as I experiment with a cool format. I appreciate feedback. Just hit reply!

If you want everything as soon as I publish, the best way is RSS. (If you have no clue how to use RSS, get in touch. I'll personally help you set it up.) If you want all the content but don't mind waiting, overkill digest is the way to go.

This week was gaming-heavy for me.

For starters, I had my first round of Dungeons and Dragons on Monday, and I'm hooked. It was incredibly fun, despite (or because of?) all the shenanigans of our play group. I have the 2024 rulebooks in my cart, but haven't ordered them yet. I want to play a bit more of our DnD campaign before splurging. Also, I really wanna try my hand at being a Dungeon Master.

Yesterday, after a 10-hour session (don't ask), I finished Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. What a game. Truly. Immediately after finishing I went down a theory rabbit hole (spoilers, obviously!) and my hype levels for the third installment went through the roof.

Today, I'll be playing some Magic: The Gathering Sealed and Commander at a friend's place, and depending on how late it gets, I'll continue my Clair Obscur playthrough. Busy busy!

Ok, now to this week's updates. I changed the layout a bit, so hit reply with feedback.

📬 The Link List

Nvidia is about to challenge ‘Intel Inside’ with as many as eight Arm laptops Lenovo leaked six laptops with two Arm-based Nvidia chips, the N1 and the N1X, with the latter rumored to have as many CUDA cores as a desktop RTX 5070.

This isn't the first Nvidia Arm chip, since the Switch and the Switch 2 already use them. But putting them in real computers is intriguing, and I wonder if we'll see them in handhelds, too. Maybe one running SteamOS, thanks to FEX?

CachyOS releases first big update of the year. CachyOS is my main distro at the moment, and after hitting schedule on this newsletter, I'll update my machine. The big changes here are a switch to the new Plasma Login Manager (instead of SDDM), Limine as the default bootloader, and a whole bunch of quality-of-life improvements.

Nexus Mods is working on a Linux version after all. From a recent blog post:

We’re also committing to supporting Vortex on SteamOS. We’ll be targeting vanilla Steam hardware like the Steam Deck and Steam Machine. We won’t be officially supporting any other configurations, but as Vortex is an open source project community developers will be free to extend support for their preferred Linux distros as they please.

Since this is Linux, ""won't be officially supporting"" just means the community will make it work on other distros. I doubt that's an issue.

The new Fable has me excited. This looks great. It's still just a trailer, and there is a longer overview, but what I see looks good.

For all the other games shown, check out the full Xbox Developer Direct stream.

Moving beyond consoles. From Matt:

This video from Brendon Bigley resonated with me. A PC is really the ideal gaming platform in 2026, and it's only getting better.

I agree, but I don't think a living room PC is for everyone. There are just too many moving parts for some people.

The advantage of a console is that it's a plug-and-play experience. You don't have to mess with graphics drivers, launchers, or settings. The console handles that for you. Distros like Bazzite solve some of this, but you still need to dial settings in, which may already be too much for some.

I'd love to see a tool that actually works. (There's the Nvidia app on Windows, but I honestly don't know if it's any good.) Something that knows your hardware and changes the settings for you. Maybe it offers two options like on the PS5, performance and quality, and relies on the community for the right tweaks.

But with so much hardware, pulling this off might be impossible. Maybe on the Steam Machine it would be doable, since its specs are always the same. But in this case, I prefer devs to ship their games with a preset (like how Cyberpunk2077 has a Steam Deck preset).

The JDE Peet’s board has reportedly fully backed Keurig Dr Pepper’s acquisition and recommended that shareholders accept the deal.
For Keurig Dr Pepper, a company already known for its diverse portfolio including Dr Pepper sodas and Keurig single-serve coffee systems, the acquisition of JDE Peet’s would represent a significant expansion.
Investors in Keurig Dr Pepper (NasdaqGS:KDP), currently trading at US$27.55, are closely monitoring these developments.
Potential synergies from the JDE Peet’s acquisition are expected to come from procurement, overlapping back-office functions, and selective store consolidation.","SAN FRANCISCO (Azat TV) – Peet’s Coffee is set to close approximately 27 locations across California, with a significant concentration in the Bay Area, by the end of January 2026. These closures coincide with Keurig Dr Pepper’s pursuit of an US$18 billion takeover of Peet’s parent company, JDE Peet’s, signaling a broader strategic realignment within the global coffee and beverage industry.

California Locations Affected by Closures

The impending shutdowns will impact numerous Peet’s outlets, particularly within the greater Bay Area, including some in San Francisco. While specific details on all affected stores were not immediately available, reports from the San Francisco Chronicle and SFGATE confirmed closures across various downtown shops, with the notable exception of the Embarcadero location. Employees from at least two Market Street Peet’s outlets confirmed they were informed of their closure last week, despite some stores still displaying hiring signs.

A representative from Peet’s Emeryville headquarters confirmed the figure of approximately 27 closures across California. This represents a portion of the company’s 283 nationwide locations, with 135 stores currently situated in the Bay Area alone. The reasons cited for these specific store closures include performance issues and lease factors, according to local reports.

Keurig Dr Pepper’s US$18 Billion Bid for JDE Peet’s

The store rationalization comes amidst Keurig Dr Pepper’s substantial US$18 billion all-cash bid to acquire JDE Peet’s. This proposed buyout was initially announced in August 2025 and subsequently financed through a US$7 billion raise from private equity firms in October 2025. JDE Peet’s, formed in 2019 from a merger between Jacobs Douwe Egberts and Peet’s Coffee, is currently the largest pure-play coffee entity globally, operating from Emeryville with its roasting facility in Alameda. The JDE Peet’s board has reportedly fully backed Keurig Dr Pepper’s acquisition and recommended that shareholders accept the deal.

For Keurig Dr Pepper, a company already known for its diverse portfolio including Dr Pepper sodas and Keurig single-serve coffee systems, the acquisition of JDE Peet’s would represent a significant expansion. The company recently completed a major acquisition of GHOST Energy, adding an energy drink and functional beverage line, and has seen its Dr Pepper brand gain traction through a viral TikTok jingle now featured in a national TV campaign, as reported by Simply Wall St.

Strategic Implications for the Coffee Market

Industry analysts suggest that the Peet’s store closures may foreshadow broader portfolio pruning by Keurig Dr Pepper. While closures often incur near-term restructuring charges, they can also lower fixed costs, lift average unit volumes for remaining stores, and support a more optimized channel mix. For Keurig Dr Pepper, a tighter retail footprint for Peet’s could support out-of-home profitability and facilitate a strategic shift towards its Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) segment, focusing on packaged coffee products like capsules, pods, and instant coffee, where volumes are often steadier and pricing power more robust.

Investors in Keurig Dr Pepper (NasdaqGS:KDP), currently trading at US$27.55, are closely monitoring these developments. While the stock has shown mixed performance over the past year, these strategic moves raise questions about how KDP could reshape its mix of brands and channels. Potential synergies from the JDE Peet’s acquisition are expected to come from procurement, overlapping back-office functions, and selective store consolidation. However, restructuring costs are anticipated before savings are realized, as noted by Meyka.com.

A Legacy of Coffee Innovation

Peet’s Coffee holds a significant place in American coffee culture, having been founded in 1966 by Alfred Peet in Berkeley, California. Peet is famously credited with mentoring three young entrepreneurs in the 1970s who later went on to start Starbucks, even supplying them with roasted beans for their initial venture. The company later came under the ownership of Jerry Baldwin, one of Starbucks’ co-founders, and went public in 2001 before its eventual merger into JDE Peet’s.

The strategic closures of Peet’s Coffee locations appear to be a calculated move by Keurig Dr Pepper to streamline its newly acquired coffee assets, indicating a pivot towards optimizing profitability and enhancing its CPG presence rather than maintaining an extensive brick-and-mortar retail footprint. This rationalization is a common tactic in large-scale corporate mergers, aiming to unlock long-term value despite immediate operational adjustments.",https://azat.tv/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Peet-s-Coffee.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 16:00:10.530923

And among these13 participants are two Cambridge companies: Sawston-based Pulpex is developing next generation recyclable paper bottles, and cleantech Neutreeno – based at CISL on Regent Street – has developed a digital system to help companies calculate and cut emissions in their supply chains.

Pulpex’s fibre-based bottle solution is plastic-free and manufactured from sustainably– sourced wood pulp which can be recycled in standard household recycling streams.

Pulpex was spun out of US-based premium drinks company Diageo in 2020 – the goal was to scale its plastic-free, recyclable fibre bottles innovation with major partners of the likes of Unilever and PepsiCo. The incorporation of Pulpex has proved to be a huge success. The now 50-strong company has already made waves, not least via a £62m Series D investment round led by the National Wealth Fund which closed in February 2025.

Managing director Scott Winston, noting that Pulpex’s customisable paper-based bottle is already in production at its Accelerator Park premises, told the Cambridge Independent: “Making a genuine impact on the challenge of delivering a sustainable answer to the 1.5 trillion glass and plastic bottles used per annum on the planet at present is no small task, but our team is fully focused on the goal.

“With the Series D investment supported through the National Wealth Fund and Scottish National Investment Bank we are completing our factory in Glasgow, now the ramp to billions of bottles being available over the coming few years truly begins and the focus expands to L’Oréal to gain the volumes they need to make a sustainability impact.”

What was the strategy behind joining the L’AcceleratOR programme?

“L’Oreal are recognised for advancing Green Sciences and have clearly signposted their need and intent in packaging to delivering their 2030 sustainability goals, [so] it became a natural fit to our working approach to join L’Accelerator and help drive their plastic reduction goals in the beauty product market for 2030.”

He adds: “With our production unit online we enable brands of any size to start their packaging transitions to fibre bottles from plastic and glass whilst simultaneously catalyse the global deployment of Pulpex technology via Manufacturers Under License.”

Neutreeno, meanwhile, has a headcount of 17 and closed an oversubscribed seed round last year.

“Neutreeno helps companies cut emissions and costs by identifying more efficient ways to manufacture products,” said Tom Bingham, marketing & communications manager. “We pinpoint inefficiencies in supply chains, particularly Scope 3 emissions that represent 75-95 per cent of a company’s carbon footprint.

“By using less materials and energy, manufacturers can dramatically reduce emissions and save money without changing their end products. People usually think being more sustainable is costly and complex. We make decarbonisation simple and profitable.”

And the motivation for joining L’AcceleratOR?

“L’Oréal’s commitment to sustainability and the scope of their supply chain transformation creates the ideal partnership to demonstrate our technology at scale,” replies Tom. “L’AcceleratOR will help us prove that engineering-led decarbonisation, not just better measurement, can deliver both real emissions mitigation and tangible business value in the beauty industry and beyond.”

Neutreeno has developed The Process Network, a system that combines 20 years of climate research data, covering 80 per cent of global industrial emissions and best efficiency practices.

“We’re empowering this with advanced AI and machine learning,” notes Tom. “It’s the most comprehensive system for tracking production efficiency while reducing both emissions and costs.”

For L’Oréal, the partnership with CISL is already yielding dividends.

For 115 years, L’Oréal Groupe has fulfilled the beauty aspirations of consumers around the world. It defines its approach to beauty as “essential, inclusive, ethical, generous and committed to social and environmental sustainability”.

“To accelerate sustainable solutions to market, we are being even more intentional and inclusive in our pursuit of partnerships through “L’AcceleratOR”, said Ezgi Barcenas, L’Oréal Groupe’s chief corporate responsibility officer.

“We are really energised to be co-designing the future of beauty with the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, and these 13 change makers.”

The progress being made during the first cohort’s induction has also been instructive for CISL.

“At CISL, we are proud to partner with L’Oréal, a group with a long track record of delivering disruptive innovation at scale”, said James Cole, chief innovation officer at CISL. “By identifying the most promising scalable solutions benefitting people, nature and climate, and elevating them to world stage, we are making a sustainable future not just a goal, but a reality.”

Visit L’AcceleratOR, the flagship sustainable innovation program run by L’Oréal in partnership with the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL), is making progress with the 13 start-ups and SMEs in its inaugural cohort.

Endowed with €100million over five years, L’AcceleratOR issued a first call for the new programme in June 2025.

Initially pitched to scale sustainable beauty solutions, the profile of companies involved now includes scalable sustainable solutions to solve the most urgent challenges in climate, nature, and circularity.

Prediction Market powered by

China has reportedly indicated willingness to approve NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) H200 chips for import. The timing, conditions, and competitive dynamics present a complex situation for the company's China market strategy.

The Approval That Isn't Really an Approval

Jensen Huang is currently in Shanghai. China is ""poised to approve"" H200 imports. Questions remain about whether this represents full H200 capability or a version with performance caps, volume quotas, or end-use restrictions limiting commercial deployment.

Nvidia's Q3 FY2026 earnings call revealed China data center revenue grew sequentially on ""export-compliant copper products,"" but CFO Colette Kress noted it ""remains well below levels prior to the onset of export controls."" Nvidia has been selling export-compliant chips to China for two years, and China previously represented 20-30% of revenue share.

NVDA is up 0.77% over the past week while Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) surged 12%. Nvidia's stock has shown limited movement following the news, while AMD has captured significant momentum.

AMD's Market Response

AMD's MI400 accelerators are shipping alongside Nvidia systems. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated Intel was ""caught off guard"" by AI data center demand and cannot meet supply.

AMD trades at 41x forward earnings with 60% YoY earnings growth and a PEG ratio of 0.56. Nvidia's forward P/E stands at 25x. The companies show different valuation metrics as the market assesses geopolitical factors.

The Geopolitical Landscape

China's approval of advanced chip imports occurs amid ongoing technology competition. Domestic alternatives include Alibaba's T-Head and Baidu's Kunlunxin processors.

Nvidia insiders have been active sellers. CEO Huang sold 9.9 million shares between October and December 2025. CFO Kress sold over 200,000 shares in the same window, with concentrated selling in mid-December around the approval timeline. No executives purchased stock during this period.

Market Response

The market's reaction shows uncertainty about whether China's H200 approval represents sustainable revenue opportunity. Insider selling activity, AMD's stock surge, and Nvidia's limited price movement have occurred alongside the approval news. Geopolitical tensions and China's regulatory stance remain variables in how this approval impacts Nvidia's business.

Data Shows One Habit Doubles American’s Savings And Boosts Retirement

Most Americans drastically underestimate how much they need to retire and overestimate how prepared they are. But data shows that people with one habit have more than double the savings of those who don’t.

And no, it’s got nothing to do with increasing your income, savings, clipping coupons, or even cutting back on your lifestyle. It’s much more straightforward (and powerful) than any of that.

On January 21, TD Cowen raised its price target on U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) to $66 from $65 and kept a Buy rating.

The firm said 4Q25 core EPS of $1.26 came in ahead of expectations. Net interest income and fees both surprised to the upside, while expense control stayed tight. Pre-provision operating leverage was solid during the quarter. With a more supportive setup heading into 2026, the stock outperformed after the earnings release.

In a separate development, Reuters reported that U.S. Bancorp said on January 20 it plans to acquire Wall Street brokerage BTIG for up to $1 billion in cash and stock. The deal brings in a familiar partner and strengthens the bank’s capital markets presence.

The acquisition gives U.S. Bancorp access to BTIG’s investment banking, institutional sales and trading, research, and prime brokerage capabilities as it continues to expand beyond traditional banking. Stephen Philipson, head of wealth, corporate, commercial and institutional banking at U.S. Bancorp, said:

""BTIG's addition to U.S. Bancorp is a strategic move to fill key product gaps for our corporate and institutional clients, enabling us to offer a more comprehensive suite of capital markets services.""

The relationship between the two firms goes back years. BTIG has served as U.S. Bancorp’s equity capital markets referral partner since 2014.

U.S. Bancorp will pay $725 million in cash and stock upfront, with up to an additional $275 million in cash over three years tied to performance targets. The deal is expected to add new capabilities in equity capital markets, M&A advisory, and equity trading. It should also contribute roughly $750 million in annual revenue, largely fee-based.

How grocery giants control who can sell food in your neighbourhood

Canada’s biggest grocery giants — including Loblaws, Sobeys and Metro — are using property law to control how other grocery stores, dollar stores, pharmacies and gas stations can compete with them, an investigation by CBC’s Marketplace has found.

Property controls are deals made between a land owner and retailer that restrict what kinds of businesses can operate nearby, and what the competitors are able to sell. The terms are negotiated to incentivize the business to open their store on the land.

Known in legal terms as restrictive covenants or exclusivity clauses, property controls are common across industries. In a plaza, for example, they could limit the number of veterinary offices or dental practices. While they aren’t unusual, there is criticism about their use in the grocery sector.

“These are not mom and pop shops,” said Jim Stanford, an economist and grocery industry critic. “They are not subject to the same competitive constraints as firms in other industries.”

Marketplace obtained legal documents for dozens of properties across Canada — locked behind opaque systems and paywalls — and found several property controls buried in lease agreements or even registered directly on property titles. The scope of the terms negotiated by grocery giants varied significantly from property to property.

While some contracts stipulate the giants cannot “unreasonably” withhold permission for competitors to open up or to sell food, others explicitly grant them any and all discretion.

For example, the property control attached to a Sobeys in Winnipeg states no one can sell food on the adjacent land unless Sobeys says so, and that permission can be withheld “unreasonably and arbitrarily.”

Meanwhile, a Metro property control in Waterloo, Ont., restricts what food products a Shoppers Drug Mart can sell in the same plaza and prohibits restaurants with a 50-seat capacity or more from opening within 61 metres of Metro’s store.

Metro and Sobeys have both denied that property controls are a barrier to competition, while Loblaws acknowledged last year that property controls restrict competition, but wouldn’t agree to eliminate all of them unless other major grocery retailers do the same.

Uber called out by service dog users fed up with ride rejections

Salome Solomon, who is legally blind, relies on two things to get around Ottawa: her guide dog, Zurich, and Uber.

But she says Canada’s dominant ride-hailing service keeps letting her down by failing to uphold her legal right to ride with a service animal.

Solomon, a frequent Uber user, says she was denied service around 20 times last year by drivers who refused to transport her guide dog. She has filed numerous complaints with the company, and says she’s now reaching her breaking point.

“Every rejection breaks you down, so, for me, it basically hits deep. It's like a dagger to my heart,” said Solomon, wiping away tears.

Under Canada's human rights legislation, people with disabilities have a legal right to travel with a service animal. Even so, rideshare denials remain an ongoing problem. A survey done by the advocacy group Guide Dogs for the Blind found that of the 185 U.S. and Canadian members surveyed, 83 per cent reported rideshare rejections in the first two months of 2023.

In line with Canadian legislation, Uber’s corporate policy states its drivers must accommodate service animals. But CBC’s Go Public interviewed several customers in Ontario who say they’ve been denied rides by Uber drivers within the past few months, because of their service dogs.

Uber Canada spokesperson Keerthana Rang says the company is committed to accessible service, and, over the past several years, has taken concrete steps to remedy the problem.

Efforts include an educational video, launched in 2024, that all of Uber's more than 100,000 drivers must watch. They also get periodic email reminders about their legal obligations, she said.

Rang added that drivers caught breaking the rules are barred from the ride-hailing app.

“We take this issue seriously,” she said. “We believe in equal transportation for all Canadians.”

Chinese EVs are coming to Canada. How soon will they be here? How much will they cost?

Buckle up! The electric vehicle market in this country is about to take a sharp turn.

Prime Minister Mark Carney is reopening Canada to Chinese-made EVs, lowering a 100 per cent tariff on imports, imposed in 2024, to six per cent.

There's demand for more affordable and climate-conscious EVs and, for an average customer, having Chinese EVs in the market means ""more choice"" and ""greater tech,"" said Max Morris, sales manager at Shift Electric Vehicles in Burlington, Ont.

But there has also been criticism of the deal with China from Canada’s automotive industry, saying it may put the domestic market on shakier ground.

China has shaken up the global EV landscape in recent years, offering more affordable cars, SUVs and other battery-powered and hybrid electric automobiles.

Chinese EVs can cost $10,000 to $15,000 less than those of similar size and range that are already popular in Canada.

While some are applauding the EV market opening up, others are raising other concerns about the safety and security of vehicles from companies tied to the Chinese government.

Additionally, Alfred Brandt has been tapped to serve as the executive director of the Missouri Dairy Growth Council.

MDGC is comprised of a broad group of stakeholders from across Missouri’s agricultural community. A strong dairy industry benefits all involved — from producers and agribusinesses to local communities —

by creating jobs, supporting infrastructure and driving long-term economic growth.

Brandt brings decades of dairy experience to the organization, having spent his career working directly with dairy producers, industry organizations and agricultural leaders. His deep understanding of dairy operations, policy and producer needs positions MDGC for continued success as it works to grow and strengthen the state’s dairy industry.

“We are excited for the new direction of MDGC and the clarity, leadership and momentum this collaboration has brought to dairy economic development in Missouri,” Brandt said. “The new structure and website provides MDGC the tools to support our existing dairies, while looking for new opportunities to grow the sector.”

The new website, GrowMODairy.Org, showcases the benefits of Missouri dairy production with the goal of attracting new dairies and supporting existing dairies.

“Missouri offers a compelling combination of natural resources, economic advantages and processing infrastructure, making it a smart choice for dairy producers,” says Matt Amick, director of market development for Missouri Soybeans and MDGC board chairman. “For dairy producers looking to relocate or expand, Missouri has affordability, abundant feedstuffs and a supportive agricultural environment.”

The website provides deeper insights into Missouri’s dairy advantage. The site provides information on economic and industry development; government and regulatory agency contacts; technical assistance; and input procurement and processing.

Summary

Novo Nordisk was excessively punished by the market, trading at a significant discount to Eli Lilly despite robust fundamentals and global leadership in metabolic disease.

NVO’s global infrastructure, especially outside the U.S., and its oral GLP-1 program position it for long-term relevance as obesity pharmacotherapy expands worldwide.

Recent valuation divergence was more amplified by retail-driven narrative momentum than by fundamental business deterioration; the stock’s drop below $50 represented an overreaction.

Valuation discipline is critical—NVO offers opportunity at current levels, but reassessment is warranted if the price rises above $75 without substantial earnings expansion.

Quick Insights

NVO’s entrenched international infrastructure and decades-long relationships with health systems provide durable advantages, making it less U.S.-dependent and better positioned for global obesity pharmacotherapy expansion.

The oral semaglutide program could unlock mass-market adoption by removing injection barriers, potentially reaching tens of millions globally and generating multi-tens-of-billions in annual revenue even at lower price points.

If NVO rises to $75 without confirmed earnings expansion, the thesis changes; above that level, gradual reduction and redeployment are advised, emphasizing the need to avoid sentiment-driven overvaluation.

(IBM) as it prepares to release its quarterly financial results this week. The technology conglomerate is set to report on January 28, with the announcement serving as a pivotal moment for investor sentiment following recent share price volatility and amid a major strategic acquisition.

Recent regulatory filings from institutional investors reveal a notable lack of consensus regarding IBM's near-term prospects. Activity detailed in the latest 13F reports paints a picture of divided opinion. On one side, firms like Symphony Financial significantly reduced their holdings by approximately 30%, with First Citizens Bank & Trust also paring back its position.

Conversely, other major market participants have viewed the recent price movement as a buying opportunity. Global Assets Advisory aggressively expanded its stake by more than 33%, while CIBC Asset Management engaged in counter-cyclical purchasing. This investor disagreement unfolds against a backdrop of recent pressure on the stock. Shares closed Friday's session at 259.25 euros, marking a weekly decline of about 15 percent.

Strategic Acquisition Clears Key Obstacle

Beyond the quarterly figures, IBM's planned strategic expansion remains a central focus. The company's proposed $11 billion acquisition of the data-streaming platform Confluent has passed a significant milestone. A key U.S. antitrust waiting period expired on January 13, clearing a regulatory path for the deal to conclude by mid-2026. Market experts interpret this development as a positive signal for the company's strategic planning certainty.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Market Experts Maintain Bullish Outlook

Despite the stock's recent turbulence, analyst sentiment remains largely positive. Several investment firms have reaffirmed or raised their assessments in January. Analysts at Jefferies and Evercore ISI have increased their price targets, seeing potential for the stock to reach the $330 to $360 range. JPMorgan also confirmed its rating just ahead of the earnings release.

The immediate market focus is squarely on the fourth-quarter performance. Consensus estimates project earnings per share (EPS) to land between $4.28 and $4.31. Following an earnings beat in the third quarter, the upcoming report is seen as a critical test of whether IBM's growth narrative remains intact in the current economic environment.

The release on Wednesday, January 28, is expected to dictate the stock's short-term trajectory. Investors will scrutinize whether the company meets or exceeds ambitious profit targets and if management provides further clarity on the integration roadmap for Confluent.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2443682_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 11:02:04.710793

Parker-Hannifin has a three-year median payout ratio of 28% (where it is retaining 72% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like Parker-Hannifin is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.

Moreover, Parker-Hannifin is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years.

Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Parker-Hannifin's future ROE will be 25% which is again, similar to the current ROE.

After the initial public offering (IPO), the Department of Defense is expected to convert its preferred stock into common stock in the new company.
That's ""missile solutions"" -- although I presume L3 will come up with a catchier name for it once it's a stand-alone company.
The third company will be what remains of L3Harris after it's shed all its engines and motors businesses.","It's been a busy couple of weeks for L3Harris (LHX 0.29%), the defense contractor that transformed itself into a defense contractor-cum-space company when it bought Aerojet Rocketdyne back in 2022.

The excitement began on Jan. 5, when L3Harris announced it would reorganize its current four main business divisions into just three:

Space and mission systems (satellite and payload capabilities, including missile warning and defense, as well as maritime, air, special missions, and other global defense and civil government programs).

Communications and spectrum dominance (communications and electronic warfare).

Missile solutions (propulsion, hypersonics, and other advanced missile technologies).

The second shoe drops

One day later, L3 announced that private equity firm AE Industrial Partners will buy a 65% stake in L3's ""space propulsion and power systems business,"" which was part of the Aerojet Rocketdyne division before the aforementioned reorganization. Reclaiming the historic name Rocketdyne, this business has ""developed the upper-stage rocket engines used in national security, civil, and commercial missions for more than 60 years, as well as in-space propulsion, nuclear power and avionics assets."" In particular, Rocketdyne builds the R10 engine, which powers the second stage of United Launch Alliance's Vulcan Centaur rocket and NASA's Space Launch System.

L3Harris will retain a minority interest in Rocketdyne, but AE's investment is being characterized as an acquisition. So essentially, what we have here is L3 spinning off and selling its non-military rocket engine division to AE.

The plot thickens

L3Harris announced its latest big move just this past Tuesday. In what management termed ""a first-of-its-kind proposed partnership with the Department of War"" -- President Trump's name for the Department of Defense -- the company will accept a $1 billion investment, in the form of the purchase of preferred stock, in its missile solutions business, which it's also spinning off.

The investment part of this plan is expected to happen this quarter, the first quarter of 2026. Missile solutions will then be spun off and taken public as a separate company in the second half of 2026. After the initial public offering (IPO), the Department of Defense is expected to convert its preferred stock into common stock in the new company.

To be clear, we're talking about two separate businesses here. Rocketdyne, which builds non-military rocket engines for ULA and NASA, is the L3 division getting spun off and sold to AE Industrial. Missile solutions builds motors for military missiles such as the Patriot PAC-3, THAAD, Tomahawk, and the Standard Missile family of missiles -- and, despite being described as one of three L3 divisions that L3 is reorganizing just last week, it seems the missile solutions division is also being spun off.

And to make the situation even more crystal clear, L3 CEO Christopher Kubasik confirmed that once its missile solutions business IPOs, it will be a ""pure-play missile solutions provider"" with a mission to be part of America's ""Arsenal of Freedom.""

What this means for investors

What's the upshot for investors here? Clearly, big changes are afoot, and an investment in just L3Harris today could end up meaning you own three separate companies a few months from now -- so be careful if that's not your intent.

One of these companies will produce engines for non-military rockets. That's Rocketdyne.

Another will produce motors for military missiles. That's ""missile solutions"" -- although I presume L3 will come up with a catchier name for it once it's a stand-alone company.

The third company will be what remains of L3Harris after it's shed all its engines and motors businesses. What remains of L3 will include two businesses: space and mission systems, and communications and spectrum dominance.

It's not 100% clear at this point how big any of these businesses will be, or which specific product lines they will take with them or keep. But reviewing the latest data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, I'm guessing is that Rocketdyne and the missile solutions business will be dividing up approximately $9.3 billion in annual revenue and a little more than $1.1 billion in operating profit, while rump L3Harris will keep about $12.3 billion in business, with about $2.2 billion in operating profit. When all's said and done, L3Harris should come out of this restructuring significantly smaller, but also considerably more profitable, after shedding its engine businesses.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851601%2Fdelta-iv-heavy-rocket-launch-at-night.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-25 11:02:19.647696

The Hype is Real: S&P Global Inc on TikTok and Beyond

Here’s the funny part: S&P Global doesn’t trend the way Tesla, Nvidia, or the latest crypto pump does. It’s not a meme. It’s not a ""to the moon"" moment. But on finance TikTok and YouTube, the stock keeps popping up in content around ""sleep-well"" compounders, boring-but-rich portfolios, and long-term dividend plays.

Creators who are deep into fundamentals and not just chasing quick spikes are calling out S&P Global as one of those stocks that just quietly grinds higher over time. Think: recurring revenue, essential data, and a business that huge banks, funds, and corporations literally rely on to function.

Is it viral in the ""everyone’s talking about it"" way? Not really. Is it viral in the ""smart money keeps mentioning it"" way? Absolutely.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

S&P Global Inc is not a gadget, not a consumer app, not something you download. It’s the company behind the credit ratings, market indices, and financial data that fuel the money world. Here are three core things you actually need to know:

1. It owns some of the most powerful brands in finance

S&P Global is the name behind the S&P 500 index that basically everyone uses to track the US stock market. Its credit ratings business is one of the go-to sources when governments and corporations borrow money. Its data and analytics tools feed traders, banks, asset managers, and corporations with info they literally cannot function without.

Translation: this is not some nice-to-have subscription service. It’s infrastructure-level finance. When you’re embedded this deep, you don’t just disappear when trends shift.

2. It’s a recurring-revenue machine

Instead of chasing one-off sales, S&P Global leans on recurring contracts, subscriptions, and long-term relationships. That means more predictable cash flow and less ""boom and bust"" drama. The business sells information, analytics, benchmarks, and ratings that companies and investors need constantly, not just once.

For you as an investor, that kind of business model usually means more stability and more room for long-term growth, not just hype-driven spikes.

3. It’s riding the data and analytics megatrend

The world is drowning in data, but the winners are the companies that can structure it, verify it, and sell it in a way that matters for big money decisions. S&P Global plays right in that lane.

From climate and ESG data to risk analytics, indices, and real-time market insights, S&P Global is leaning into the whole ""data is the new oil"" wave, but for serious institutional money. It’s not a flashy AI story, but it absolutely taps into the same forces that are driving the tech boom.

S&P Global Inc vs. The Competition

You can’t talk about S&P Global without mentioning its biggest rival: Moody’s.

Both companies live in the same world: credit ratings, research, risk analysis, and financial data. If you’re building a portfolio of ""financial infrastructure"" stocks, these two are usually side by side on the list.

S&P Global’s edge

S&P doesn’t just do ratings. It owns major indices and market benchmarks, which act like a toll booth every time investors use products linked to those benchmarks. It also leans heavily into broader market and sector data and has been expanding into more analytics and workflow tools.

Moody’s edge

Moody’s is laser-focused on ratings and risk analytics. It’s also a strong compounder and widely respected, but it doesn’t have the same iconic index footprint as S&P Global.

Who wins the clout war?

On pure name recognition among everyday investors, S&P Global wins because of the S&P 500 brand. On TikTok and YouTube, you’ll often see people mention Moody’s in the same breath, but the ""S&P"" label just hits different because it’s literally printed on charts, ETFs, and financial news every single day.

In terms of vibe, S&P Global feels like the more diversified, platform-style play, while Moody’s feels like the highly focused specialist. If you’re chasing broad data and index exposure, S&P Global usually gets the nod.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Here’s the real talk.

Is it worth the hype?

S&P Global isn’t meme-stock hype. It’s ""grown-up money"" hype. The kind of stock that long-term investors flex when they show how their portfolios aged well over years, not weeks.

The clout doesn’t come from viral price spikes. It comes from consistency, brand power, and the fact that this company is wired into the plumbing of global finance. If you’re after a must-have, blue-chip style data name rather than a quick flip, S&P Global is absolutely in that conversation.

Price-performance: is it a no-brainer?

That depends on how you think about price. S&P Global often trades at a premium because of its quality, its dominant position, and its recurring revenue model. You’re not buying it because it’s cheap on a chart. You’re buying it because it’s built like a long-term compounder.

For short-term traders, that premium can feel painful. For long-term investors, it can be the cost of admission to a high-quality franchise. It’s not a guaranteed win, but it’s also not some speculative gamble on an unproven business.

Game-changer or total flop?

In your portfolio, S&P Global is more ""foundation"" than ""lottery ticket."" It’s a game-changer in the sense that its business model quietly supports the whole market. As a stock, it’s more likely to be a steady wealth-builder than a viral rocket ship.

So is it a cop or drop? For short-term hype-chasers, probably a drop. For long-term, fundamentals-first investors who want exposure to financial data and indices, it looks a lot more like a cop – if you’re cool with paying up for quality and riding it out.

As always: this is not financial advice. Do your own research before you throw money at any ticker.

The Business Side: SPGI

Now let’s zoom in on the actual stock: SPGI, tied to ISIN US78409V1044.

Using live market data from multiple sources, the latest available quote for SPGI as of the most recent trading session shows the last close price, not an intraday move, because real-time streaming data is not accessible here. That means you should always double-check the live price on your own before buying or selling.

What stands out when you look at SPGI over time is how the market treats it: this is typically priced like a high-quality growth compounder, not a bargain-bin value stock. The market is effectively saying, ""We believe this company will keep growing, keep printing cash, and keep being essential.""

Investors generally watch a few key angles with SPGI:

1. Revenue growth and margins

Because S&P Global sells high-value data and analytics, the focus is on how fast that revenue is growing and how strong the profit margins stay. The more it leans into scalable digital products, the better its margin story tends to look.

2. Cycles in credit and capital markets

When companies and governments issue more debt, the ratings business gets busy. When markets are active, data and indices get even more use. So while S&P Global is built on recurring revenue, parts of the business still move with financial cycles. You’ll see that reflected in how the stock trades around big macro headlines.

3. Competition and regulation

As one of the dominant players in ratings and benchmarks, S&P Global always has a target on its back from regulators and competitors. Any major shift in how ratings are used, how benchmarks are managed, or how data is regulated can impact the story. That’s part of the risk baked into the ticker.

So where does that leave you?

If your watchlist is full of AI demos, EV startups, and small-cap gambles, SPGI is the opposite energy: boring on the surface, quietly powerful underneath. You’re not buying a trend. You’re buying a core piece of how markets actually run.

Real talk: if you want your portfolio to have at least one ""adult in the room"" stock that lives in the financial infrastructure space, SPGI deserves a hard look. If you only want fast pumps and viral charts, this probably won’t scratch that itch – but the people quietly holding it might be the ones still winning in ten years.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405049_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 08:59:25.697336

Flutter Entertainment (FLUT) Is Down 7.2% After Tax And Regulatory Pressures Intensify - Has The Bull Case Changed?

January 25, 2026

Flutter Entertainment has faced a series of developments, including the appointment of Best Buy chairman David Kenny as a future independent non-executive director, regulatory scrutiny culminating in a £2 million social responsibility settlement, and growing concern over UK plans to raise gambling taxes.

These governance and regulatory shifts, combined with criticism of recent management performance, are reshaping how analysts and investors evaluate Flutter’s long-term positioning in global betting and gaming.

We’ll now examine how concerns over UK gambling tax increases and regulatory pressure are influencing Flutter Entertainment’s investment narrative.

The end of cancer? These like cancer and Alzheimer's.

What Is Flutter Entertainment's Investment Narrative?

For Flutter to make sense in a portfolio, you need to believe in its ability to turn strong global betting and gaming positions into sustainable profits despite current missteps. The stock has sold off hard in recent months even though consensus targets still sit well above the current price, suggesting the market is wrestling with near term earnings pressure, governance questions and regulatory risk rather than writing off the business outright. The UK tax proposals and the £2 million settlement add to that regulatory overhang, while the analyst downgrades point to lower conviction around short term upside. At the same time, the refreshed board, including the incoming appointment of David Kenny, hints at a more assertive oversight of management execution and US listing ambitions, which could become a key catalyst if performance stabilises.

However, the UK regulatory direction and tax burden could have a bigger impact than many expect. Despite retreating, Flutter Entertainment's shares might still be trading above their fair value and there could be some more downside. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Seven members of the Simply Wall St Community see fair value anywhere from about US$160 to a very large figure near US$1,000, underlining just how far opinions can stretch when regulatory risk, recent downgrades and governance changes all sit in the mix; it is worth weighing several of these perspectives before deciding how much of Flutter’s current uncertainty you are comfortable with.

Nichanian will be succeeded by , 36, the first lady of color to direct a major Pairs fashion house. She will make her debut collection one year from now for Hermès, the most profitable luxury label in the world, bar none.

In a remarkable career, the 71-year-old Nichanian has guided the men’s division of the classiest brand of them all for nearly two generations. Her debut collection for the house dates to 1988. Unthinkable nowadays that anyone could have such staying power when the career expectancy of most fashion designers is to become a hired gun at a name brand for a decade at most.

Instead, Véronique Nichanian deservedly kept her position since 1988, when she was appointed by Hermès. Sending out one hit collection after another until she decided at her own behest, apparently, to take her retirement.

These clothes were an excellent way to exit. Full of quiet luxury, but quiet with panache - like the wonderful tricks she played on lapels. Placing a single strip of leather behind multiple lapels, whether on topcoats, mohair suits, or super tuxedoes, adding zest with a deft hand.

Her sense of raffish elegance was exceptional, as was her sense of triumph. At the finale, there was a brilliant flourish of three naval or black crocodile coats and suits that one dreamed of owning. The whole show worn by a multi-racial cast.

Presented before a front row packed full of admirers, including Sir , Usher, actors James McAvoy and Chace Crawford, and rapper Travis Scott before drama rock like ""Bed Stuy ’79"" by Vanessa Van Ness.

Die Notierungen sind zum Schluss an der Börse München um 4,09 Prozent nach unten gejagt. Auf Tradegate hingegen ist der Kurs weniger massiv nach unten gelaufen. Am Ende steht jedoch ein Rückgang unter eine wichtige Kursuntergrenze. Nichsdestotrotz haben die Notierungen eine im Vergleich sehr starke Woche hinter sich. Der Rückblick:

Die Aktie war in etwa bei 2,05-2,06 Euro in die Woche gegangen und bewegte sich nicht besonders stark aufwärts. Am Mittwoch kam es kurz vor Ende des Handelsschlusses allerdings zu einem kleinen Crash in Richtung von 1,81 Euro. Der kurzen Erholung bis Donnerstagnachmittag folgte dann ein massiver Ausbruch nach oben um insgesamt rund 15 Prozent. Die Aktie konnte sich am Freitag dann ausgehend von den erreichten 2,20 Euro sogar auf 2,295 Euro nach oben schieben. Zum Schluss wurden wahrscheinlich Gewinne mitgenommen.

Plug Power Aktie Chart

Bald kommt es zum Schwur

Die Gesamtbilanz der Woche ist immer noch ausgesprochen erfreulich, zumindest aus Sicht der bestehenden Aktionäre. In den vergangenen fünf Tagen ging es um knapp 12 Prozent aufwärts. Damit hat sich die Plug Power im Laufe des bisherigen Jahres auf 31,40 Prozent nach oben geschoben. Das ist relativ erstaunlich. Denn die neue Woche hat einen wichtigen Termin parat:

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Plug Power?

Das Papier wird sich sicherlich massiv bewegen. Am 29. Januar findet eine außerordentliche Aktionärsversammlung statt. Dann geht es um die Erhöhung des Grundkapitals. Sollte dieser Beschluss gefasst werden, dann wird das amerikanischen Unternehmen neue Aktien emittieren.

Dies verwässert den Kurs alter Aktien, verbessert aber die finanzielle Basis. Wie das Unternehmen dann weiter bewertet wird, hängt davon ab, welchen Umstand die Börsen höher bewerten. Einen ersten Aufschlag hat die vergangene Woche ja bereits gebracht.

Sollte es weiter nach oben gehen, würden sich zumindest Analysten sicherlich nicht überrascht zeigen. Die gehen derzeit immer noch davon aus, dass die Kurse deutlich steigen können. Die Kursziele sind oberhalb der aktuellen Bewertungen. Die neue Woche wird sehr herausfordernd und spannend, am 29. Januar entscheidet sich viel.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was spotted by many local residents after arriving in Shanghai on Friday, according to ThePaper.cn, as the US chip giant faces fierce competition from local rivals. Chinese experts said Huang’s visit is aimed at projecting a “China-friendly” image and boosting morale among local employees, while also seeking to engage Chinese authorities and key clients in an effort to secure large buyers capable of making prompt payments for H200 chips.

On Saturday, Huang was seen visiting the Rushan Road local vegetable market in Shanghai’s Lujiazui area, where he sampled and bought fruits and handed out New Year red envelopes to several vendors, according to ThePaper.cn.

Huang attended an Nvidia event on Saturday, according to posts by some users on Chinese lifestyle-sharing platform Xiaohongshu, who claimed the oranges he bought at a local wet market were intended to be handed out to employees at the company’s annual gathering.

Ma Jihua, a veteran industry observer, told the Global Times that that Huang’s increasingly frequent visits to China in recent years — whether wearing traditional Chinese attire or visiting local markets — reflect a carefully calibrated form of expression aimed at conveying a more China-friendly image while navigating political sensitivities in the US, a practice also seen in visits by other US technology executives.

Ma added that Huang’s latest trip is widely viewed as an effort to engage Chinese authorities and key customers, with the aim of identifying large buyers able to move forward quickly on purchases of H200 chips.

After his Shanghai trip, Huang is set to travel to Beijing, Shenzhen and the island of Taiwan, according to Reuters, citing a person familiar with the issue.

Huang traveled to China at least three times in 2025 and met with China’s commerce minister in July, and returned again at the start of 2026. Experts said his repeated visits highlight the importance he places on the Chinese market and his hope to maintain stable and constructive trade engagement with China.

Zhou Mi, a senior researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times that Huang’s visits to China around Nvidia’s New Year events have become a routine, especially as Nvidia’s position has grown more sensitive amid a complex external environment. Huang has repeatedly signaled his desire to stay engaged with the China market. Zhou noted that this trip is primarily aimed at boosting morale within Nvidia’s China team, reassuring staff and partners, and gathering first-hand feedback on market demand to help guide the company’s future development.

Zhou added that the H200 chip is another key issue, as China has compliance and security concerns that Nvidia needs to address. He said that strong computing performance alone is not enough if related risks remain unresolved, and that meeting regulatory and compliance requirements is essential. Given the strong appeal of the China market, how Nvidia responds to these concerns will be critical to its ability to pursue stable, long-term development in China.

The US administration in January cleared sales of Nvidia's H200 chips, one of its most advanced products, while taking a 25 percent government cut from those sales, according to the BBC.

However, due to the deeply rooted anxiety held by some US politicians about China's progress in high-tech sectors, the US has displayed a contradictory approach toward exports of high-end chips to China.

On Wednesday, a US House committee focused on foreign affairs approved bipartisan legislation calling for arms-sale-style congressional oversight of advanced AI chip exports, Bloomberg reported.

According to Bloomberg, under the legislation, the administration would be required to notify Congress of advanced AI chip sales before they are approved, giving lawmakers the power to review and block export licenses to China, Russia, Iran and other so-called adversaries through a joint resolution.

On January 15, in response to a question regarding that US President Donald Trump said earlier that the US government would approve Nvidia H200 AI chip sales to China and would collect a roughly 25 percent fee on the chip sales, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said that China has repeatedly made its position clear on US chip exports to China and related tariff issues.

Commenting on reports that the Chinese government has told some technology companies it would approve purchases of H200 chips only under special circumstances, He Yongqian, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce, said on Thursday, “I am not aware of the situation you mentioned. ”

While China's semiconductor industry welcomes positive China-US exchanges in technological innovation and industrial development in line with both sides' regulations, it must remain highly vigilant regarding the US' erratic stance on exports of high-end chips, Wei Shaojun, a deputy head of the China Semiconductor Industry Association, told the Global Times in a recent exclusive interview.

Wei pointed out, the US’ stance – alternately easing restrictions and applying pressure on high-end chips – makes it difficult for others to discern its true strategic intentions: Is the recent ""relaxation"" a genuine signal to promote positive interaction, or is it a new tactic aimed at disrupting our development pace and lulling us into complacency?

“China's semiconductor industry must remain highly vigilant toward this, resolutely refuse to be deceived by superficial appearances, and, even more importantly, must not waver in its confidence and determination to persist on the path of indigenous development in advanced process technologies and other key areas,” Wei said.

China welcomes all foreign companies, including Nvidia, to deepen their presence in the Chinese market, but core concerns on China’s side must also be addressed by Nvidia for cooperation to be sustainable, experts said.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2026/2026-01-25/fd67ba7d-e1df-416a-ab51-490558fe5930.jpeg,N,,2026-01-25 01:58:56.579262

India's highest court has delivered a significant verdict impacting foreign investment structures, reversing a Delhi High Court judgment that had favored Tiger Global. The Supreme Court's decision aligns with the Authority for Advance Ruling's initial stance, classifying Tiger Global's 2018 sale of shares in Flipkart Singapore to Walmart as a transaction designed to circumvent tax obligations. This ruling is the first major Supreme Court interpretation to apply India's General Anti Avoidance Rules (GAAR) to structures established prior to the legislation's enactment.

GAAR's Evolving Frontier

Implemented on April 1, 2017, India's GAAR provisions have seen their effective scope significantly broadened by this judgment. The Supreme Court has signaled that the grandfathering provisions, intended to protect investments made before 2017, do not shield the underlying transactional structures from scrutiny if their primary purpose was tax avoidance. This challenges the presumption that investments predating GAAR were immune to challenges based on avoidance. The court clarified that tax authorities can now reject applications for advance rulings based on a prima facie assessment that a transaction was designed to avoid taxes, even without a conclusive finding.

Substance Over Form Prevails

The Supreme Court's decision centers on the principle of economic substance over legal form. Investigations revealed that Tiger Global, registered in Mauritius, was controlled by a single individual from the United States. The entity functioned as a conduit for investments made between 2011 and 2014 into Flipkart India via Flipkart Singapore. Critically, the value of Flipkart Singapore's shares was derived solely from Indian assets, making the transaction subject to indirect transfer provisions under Indian tax law. The court determined that the investment structure was engineered to ensure no tax liability would arise in any jurisdiction upon future share sales, thereby constituting an impermissible tax avoidance arrangement.

Tax Treaty Scrutiny Intensifies

This ruling marks a notable shift in India's tax jurisprudence, moving away from a strict reliance on documentation like Tax Residency Certificates (TRCs) to determine eligibility for treaty benefits. The judgment implies that while a TRC is important, tax authorities can delve deeper into the factual matrix of a case to ascertain an entity's true residency status and the substance of its operations. The emphasis on GAAR and economic substance suggests that treaty benefits, particularly under agreements like the India-Mauritius Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement, may be denied for transactions found to be abusive. This underscores India's commitment to protecting its tax base and asserting its fiscal sovereignty.

Market Resonance for Investors

The verdict introduces a more rigorous regulatory environment for foreign investors operating in India. While established entities such as Walmart Inc. (WMT), which boasts a market capitalization of approximately $465 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio around 28.1 as of January 24, 2026, function within a broad financial ecosystem, this ruling highlights the need for verifiable economic substance in all inbound investments. The trend indicates that tax planning strategies must be intrinsically linked to genuine commercial objectives to avoid challenges from tax authorities. Investors must now ensure that their structuring of investments not only adheres to legal requirements but also demonstrates tangible economic rationale to mitigate risks of prolonged tax disputes.",https://images.whalesbook.com/images/thumbnail_6974a35e2f8dded575717f8a_1769251728424.jpeg,N,,2026-01-25 00:58:43.360594

LAVAL — Maureen Murphy scored twice as the Montreal Victoire defeated the Ottawa Charge 3-1 in front of a sold-out crowd at Place Bell on Saturday afternoon.

Ann-Renee Desbiens made 23 saves for the Victoire (6-3-0-5), who moved into second place in the Professional Women’s Hockey League with the win. Abby Roque added an empty-net goal.

Faduza Kadirova scored for the Charge (3-5-0-7). Gwyneth Philips made 33 saves.

Montreal opened the scoring 12:52 into the first period.

Amanda Boulier caused a turnover at the Montreal blue-line, leading to a two-on-one. Hayley Scamurra brought the puck in, and while her shot was stopped by Philips, Murphy put away the rebound after trailing the play.

Murphy scored her second of the game on the power play with 14.4 seconds left in the first when she wired a one-timer from the left face-off circle into the top corner of the net off of a pass from Erin Ambrose.

Ottawa appeared to cut the deficit in the first half of the second period, but the play was ruled a no goal because of incidental contact with Desbiens before the puck crossing the line.

With 5:46 remaining in the second period, Ottawa finally got on the board when a Michela Cava shot from the top of the slot hit off of Kadirova to make it 2-1.

The Charge pulled their goaltender with just over two minutes left in regulation to try and find the tying goal.

Takeaways

Victoire: Desbiens was once again outstanding for Montreal. She has yet to allow more than two goals in a game, and has allowed one or fewer goals in seven of her 12 starts this season.

Charge: Ottawa’s only two regulation losses in their last nine games have come against Montreal at Place Bell, the team they entered the game chasing for the league’s final playoff spot.

Key Moment

Desbiens stopped Emily Clark’s breakway early in the second period that was among the better saves she made in what turned out to be a one-goal game before the empty-net goal.

Key Stat

Ottawa had the league’s best power play entering the game, but the Victoire held them without a goal in four opportunities.

Up Next

Victoire: Host the Toronto Sceptres on Wednesday.

Charge: Host the Seattle Torrent on Wednesday.

Team Green is known to be the only customer of the A16 process, and according to reports, Jensen already has sufficient chip supply from TSMC, credited to long-term contracts.

Not just NVIDIA, but AMD also made a massive bet by switching to TSMC, especially since the company had its own fab network, which later spun out as GlobalFoundries. Speaking with Jodi Shelton, AMD's CEO Lisa Su did reveal that putting their trust in TSMC was ""one of the major decisions"" made under her leadership, and by the looks of it, this eventually turned out to be a huge win for AMD, in terms of gaining client and server market share.

ID33,OpenAI,2026-01-24 19:12:38+00:00,Fortune,Why Mark Zuckerberg is positioning Meta as an AI infrastructure giant - Fortune,Sharon Goldman,,,,,https://fortune.com/2026/01/24/meta-compute-zuckerberg-ai-infrastructure-giant-data-center/,"A growing perception that Meta is playing catch-up For some Meta-watchers, the Meta Compute announcement was puzzling.
After all, Meta is already an AI infrastructure giant.
Powell McCormick is also a key strategic hire for the Meta Compute effort, Umesh Padval, an experienced investor and board member, told Fortune.
In a social media post shared the day Meta Compute was announced, “Big Short” investor Michael Burry wrote: “Meta gives in, throwing away its one saving grace.
But since Meta has already poured tens of billions into AI data centers and signaled hundreds of billions more in long-term infrastructure commitments, it looks like that train left the station long ago.","The new organization is designed to secure the massive amounts of computing power—measured in gigawatts, each of which could power hundreds of thousands of homes—needed for Meta’s drive to build AI models that lead to “superintelligence.”

“Meta is planning to build tens of gigawatts this decade, and hundreds of gigawatts or more over time,” Zuckerberg wrote. “How we engineer, invest, and partner to build this infrastructure will become a strategic advantage.”

Under the new structure, Zuckerberg said longtime Meta executive Santosh Janardhan will continue to run the company’s technical architecture, software, custom chips, and the day-to-day building and operation of Meta’s vast data center network. Meanwhile, Daniel Gross—one of Zuckerberg’s high-profile AI hires from last summer, who was previously cofounder of Safe Superintelligence with former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever—will lead a new group focused on the long game: how much computing power Meta will need years from now, where it should be built, how to secure scarce chips and energy, and how to model the business impact of those bets.

Zuckerberg also announced a new Meta president and vice chair, Dina Powell McCormick, to work on developing partnerships with governments to finance and deploy data centers around the world. She was previously deputy national security advisor for strategy to President Trump.

A growing perception that Meta is playing catch-up

For some Meta-watchers, the Meta Compute announcement was puzzling. After all, Meta is already an AI infrastructure giant. It has been a year since the company broke ground on its Hyperion site—a 4-million-square-foot data center campus in northeast Louisiana that Zuckerberg famously told President Trump was roughly comparable to the size of lower Manhattan. Why, then, did Meta suddenly need to declare a new top-level organization to do what it already appears to be doing at historic scale?

“This was kind of a head scratcher, I didn’t understand it at first,” said Patrick Moorhead, founder and chief analyst at Moor Insights and Strategy. He suggested the message about Meta Compute was really meant for investors and employees, signaling that Meta remains a serious contender in a club led by Microsoft, Google, Oracle, OpenAI, and xAI. “It’s Meta saying, ‘Here is our strategy to roll this out,’” he said.

Rick Pederson of Bow River Capital agreed that the announcement responds to a growing perception among market analysts that Meta is playing catch-up with Google and OpenAI in the AI arms race.

“It was a way to discuss their focus, their intentionality surrounding the build-out of AI, computational capacity and infrastructure,” he said. “I would imagine that the other major hyperscalers have organizations something like this. But he took the opportunity to define it.” Even though the company spent over $70 billion on AI infrastructure last year and plans to spend another $600 billion in the next two years, Google and OpenAI are spending at least that amount, he added. “So I think this gave Zuckerberg a chance to talk about not just the emphasis, but also how they’re going to do it.”

Doubling down on infrastructure as an investment portfolio

Some experts said they are not at all surprised by the move to announce Meta Compute. “Meta is doubling down on infrastructure as an investment portfolio rather than simply a cost center,” said Lane Dilg, former head of infrastructure policy at OpenAI and founder of boutique advisory firm Apeiro.

As the AI boom accelerates, Meta no longer sees data centers, GPUs, power contracts, and custom chips as mere plumbing for its products. It treats them as strategic assets—more like a capital allocator than a tech company. In effect, Dilg said, Meta is positioning itself not just against other hyperscalers, but against the world’s most sophisticated investment platforms.

In that landscape, she explained, choosing Daniel Gross to co-lead the initiative makes sense. “Gross’s experience building AI-native and agentic platforms matters, paired with his compute expertise,” she said, pointing to the supercomputer he built with NFDG coinvestor Nat Friedman—now Meta’s head of products. Their effort became the Andromeda Cluster, a network of computing stockpiles totaling more than 4,000 GPUs, which they made available to their portfolio companies at below-market rates.

Gross has dropped hints about his own recruiting push for Meta Compute, saying in a recent post on X that he is hiring people with backgrounds in “deep learning, supply chains, commodities, semiconductors, sovereigns, energy, Excel, prediction markets, monitoring situations, etc.” This suggests Meta is preparing to hedge against volatility in power and hardware costs—and to make long-term bets shaped not just by technology, but by energy markets, supply chains, and geopolitics.

Powell McCormick is also a key strategic hire for the Meta Compute effort, Umesh Padval, an experienced investor and board member, told Fortune. “Hyperscalers are now focused on how to get power and are investing in power projects financed by cash and debt,” he said. “With her banking and political background, she would work with the Meta data center group to finance and get approvals to enable faster building of the compute capacity.”

Critics say Meta’s capital-intensive model would drag down returns

Not all are supportive of Meta’s move, however. In a social media post shared the day Meta Compute was announced, “Big Short” investor Michael Burry wrote: “Meta gives in, throwing away its one saving grace. Watch ROIC crash.” Burry’s warning reflects a fear that Meta is abandoning its ability to generate enormous profits without sinking vast sums into physical infrastructure. By embracing gigawatt-scale data centers, he argues, Meta is shifting toward a far more capital-intensive model—one that could drag down returns and make the company look more like a utility.

But since Meta has already poured tens of billions into AI data centers and signaled hundreds of billions more in long-term infrastructure commitments, it looks like that train left the station long ago.","https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2235448143.jpg?resize=1200,600",N,,2026-01-24 15:02:11.779934

Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY 0.53%) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.37%) are healthcare leaders that are also using AI. And there could be more advances from here for both the companies and their shareholders.

Bristol Myers Squibb teams up with Microsoft

Bristol Myers Squibb is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies. Its primary focus is on cardiovascular, cancer, and immune disorders. The company just announced a partnership with Microsoft (MSFT +3.45%), the third-largest component of the S&P 500 index.

Microsoft's imaging technology is used in 80% of U.S. hospitals. By pairing these systems with Bristol Myers Squibb's expertise in oncology and drug delivery, the two companies hope to create an AI-enabled workflow that leads to earlier diagnosis of lung cancer and a clearer path toward treatment.

In some ways, this is a small event, but it highlights the value AI can offer in assisting medical professionals in identifying and treating illness. And if it is successful, it seems highly likely that Bristol Myers Squibb will attempt to expand the effort to additional indications.

Intuitive Surgical is just getting started

Intuitive Surgical is a stock that only aggressive growth investors should consider right now. The P/E ratio is a lofty 70. However, the company is still growing very quickly, noting that the number of da Vinci surgical robots installed in 2025 was up roughly 13% from 2024. Meanwhile, the number of surgeries using one of the company's robots rose 19%. So not only is there very strong demand for the robots, but there's even stronger end-market demand for robotic surgery.

(NYSE:UBER) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi once stressed the importance of embracing cryptocurrencies for practical purposes rather than as a “store of value.”

Stablecoins Over Bitcoin?

At the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco on June 6, 2025, Khosrowshahi called Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) a “proven commodity” but said he finds crypto’s “instantiation” offers more practical benefits.

“I do think that stablecoin is quite promising, especially for global companies that are moving money around globally, to create a mechanism for us to essentially reduce costs,” he said.

At the time, Khosrowshahi said that the company was in the “study phase” for enabling cross-border stablecoin payments, calling it a “super interesting” proposition.

The Countdown: When Will Uber Go Crypto?

This was not the first time Khosrowshahi has voiced such considerations.

Speaking to CNBC in 2021, he said the company is “going to look into” Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for transactions. A year later, in 2022, he said that Uber is “absolutely” going to accept cryptocurrency for payments at some point in the future.

Meanwhile, seven months have passed since his latest remark, but the mobility giant has yet to implement cryptocurrencies as a payment option.

Uber didn’t immediately return Benzinga’s request for comment.

Are Stablecoins The Future Of Transactions?

Interestingly, Uber was among the early participants in the Diem Association, formerly Libra, joining in 2019 to support Meta Platforms‘ (NASDAQ:META) now-defunct stablecoin initiative for global payments.

A 2025 report by Grayscale found stablecoins, including USDC (CRYPTO: USDC), were facilitating nearly $800 billion in digital transactions each month, positioning themselves as credible challengers to traditional payment networks like Visa (NYSE:V).

Price Action: At the time of writing, BTC was exchanging hands at $89,963.99, up 0.71% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

Shares of Uber rose 0.22% in after-hours trading after closing 0.65% higher at $84.26 during Wednesday’s regular trading session. Year-to-date, the stock has gained over 3%.

The stock maintains a weaker price trend over the short, medium, and long terms, with Growth as its strongest category, according to Benzinga’s Edge Stock Rankings.

Though BRS working president K T Rama Rao and his cousin – former minister T Harish Rao are trying to brush it aside as a “lottapeesu case” (silly and frivolous case), sources in the party said the leadership is feeling the noose tightened around it.

According to the latest information from the party sources, KTR and Harish Rao, who were grilled by the SIT for seven hours each, were clearly that the investigators might even summon party president and former chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao for questioning, adding to the unease within the party.

The leadership is reportedly keen on formulating a coordinated response to the investigation and the political narrative emerging around it.

On Saturday, KTR and Harish Rao rushed to KCR’s Erravelli farmhouse to discuss the way out, in the event of the phone tapping case turns serious.

Apparently, the BRS leadership is trying to divert the attention of the people from the tapping issue. KTR has repeatedly alleged that he is being subjected to “character assassination,” claiming that baseless insinuations were spread linking him to film personalities.

“But he seems to have forgotten that social media platforms aligned with BRS allegedly carried defamatory reports targeting a woman IAS officer, which only indicate his double standards,” an analyst said.

Another BRS leader and former IPS officer R S Praveen Kumar tried to defend the telephone tapping done during the BRS regime, saying it is a common practice and not a crime.

He pointed out that even present SIT chief Sajjannar and DGP Shivadhar Reddy had indulged in tapping of opposition leaders’ phones during the infamous cash-for-vote scam.

On the other hand, Harish Rao directly resorted to intimidate the investigating officers warning them that they would have to face the music, once the BRS returns to power.

The Telangana Police Officers’ Association subsequently warned political leaders against undermining or threatening legally constituted investigations.

The BRS leaders are also trying to play down the investigation, saying the investigators had asked meaningless questions and in fact, they counter-questioned the SIT effectively during interrogation.

Investigators, however, maintain that all statements and evidence—including alleged proof of phone tapping—have been officially recorded and will be assessed strictly within the legal framework.

“All these attempts show that the BRS leaders are in a state of panic as the investigation is taking a serious turn with every passing day,” sources said.",https://www.greatandhra.com/newphotos11/ktr_harish21769260919.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 13:00:43.534896

The National Weather Service projects cities in the Northeast could get one to two feet of snow, and the massive weather system is likely to affect most Americans east of the Rocky Mountains.
The health system operates 11 hospitals across Maryland, and forecasts call for a foot or more of snow in some areas Saturday night into Monday morning.
“Hospitals never close, even in extreme weather,” Treber tells Chief Healthcare Executive®.
The health system also has booked rooms at local hotels within walking distance of its facilities for staff who won’t be able to get home.","With the biggest winter storm to hit some areas in years, health systems must plan to make sure hospitals are equipped for the worst, since closing isn’t an option.

But the planning also involves coordinating with local and state emergency management teams, weighing supplies, and dealing with road closures and other transportation delays. The National Weather Service projects cities in the Northeast could get one to two feet of snow, and the massive weather system is likely to affect most Americans east of the Rocky Mountains.

Meghan Treber, chief preparedness officer of the University of Maryland Medical System, has been working to coordinate readiness across the organization. The health system operates 11 hospitals across Maryland, and forecasts call for a foot or more of snow in some areas Saturday night into Monday morning.

Some of the system’s hospitals serve areas of several counties where they are the only facility providing acute care, she says.

“Hospitals never close, even in extreme weather,” Treber tells Chief Healthcare Executive®. “So our job as healthcare emergency managers is to anticipate those disruptions and then put layers of protection in place so patients can continue to receive safe care, and our staff can remain safe delivering that care.”

It’s plenty of work to staff and supply those hospitals, but the health system operates scores of other facilities. The system’s service area includes the city of Baltimore, surrounding suburbs and rural communities.

“We have an urgent care network. Our hospitals include two trauma centers. We have outpatient surgical centers and more than 340 care locations across the state,” she says. “Our entire health system is vast and serves quite a large swath of the state, all of which is going to experience the storm in a slightly different way.”

Ensuring staffing

Treber says planning for the storm began several days ago. The system began planning early to ensure hospitals had enough doctors, nurses and other staff, since the storm could affect travel into Monday.

“We plan early to ensure that we have adequate staffing for multiple days, not just for the storm itself, and that looks like coordinating so essential staff can arrive early and stay on site if needed. We provide sleeping arrangements where it's possible, and meals on site,” Treber says.

The health system also has booked rooms at local hotels within walking distance of its facilities for staff who won’t be able to get home.

Treber says plans also go beyond staff who drive to work. Plans include the possibility of public transportation services being suspended due to the weather.

If the snow total reaches forecasts, “I would absolutely expect that there will be some impact to public transportation, whether it's a full shutdown or a restriction of lines,” Treber says.

Planning for patients

The system’s hospitals began looking at which patients could go home before the storm.

“What we are trying to do is make sure that we are reviewing all of the patients that we have in our hospital and identifying the patients who can be safely discharged to home before the storm hits, because it will be very challenging to get people discharged during the storm,” she says.

The patient evaluations go beyond whether or not the patients have recovered enough to leave the hospital.

“Our case managers have to make sure that the roads are plowed, that the sidewalks are shoveled, the driveway shovel, the stairs are shoveled, and that we can get our patients back safely into their homes,” she says.

For those still in the hospital late Saturday, Treber says, “They're going to stay with us until we can safely get them home.”

Planning all year

The University of Maryland Medical System just opened a new, 400,000-square-foot logistics center to manage and distribute medical supplies for the entire organization. The logistics center opened in November, and the storm will be the first test of it. But Treber says it should improve the system’s readiness and resilience for emergencies.

The system has ordered enough medication, supplies and food for several days in case there are interruptions.

Since the logistics center supplies the entire hospital, Treber has also been talking with county officials to make sure road crews are plowing the road to the facility. County officials quickly assured her that they would clear the road to the logistic center and the roads to the hospitals.

But Treber says that also underscores the importance of regular contact with local and state officials throughout the year.

“It's a testament to the preparedness stance that we work with these people every day,” she says. “We plan with our local health departments. We plan with our emergency managers.”

It’s a strange machine, made up of a bunch of IBM System 360 mainframes connected together to a common memory unit, with all sorts of custom peripherals to support keeping track of airplanes in the sky. Absolutely go read the in-depth article on that machine if it sparks your curiosity.

It got me thinking about how strange computers were in the early days, and how boringly similar they’ve all become. Just looking at the word sizes of old machines is a great example. Over the last, say, 40 years, things that do computing have had 4, 8, 16, 32, or even 64-bit words. You noticed the powers-of-two trend going on here, right? Basically starting with the lowly Intel 4004, it’s been round numbers ever since.

On the other side of the timeline, though, you get strange beasts. The classic PDP-8 had 12-bit words, while its predecessors the PDP-6 and PDP-1 had 36 bits and 18 bits respectively. (Factors of six?) There’s a string of military guidance computers that had 27-bit words, while the Apollo Guidance computer ran 15-bit words. UNIVAC III had 25-bit words, putting the 23-bit Harvard Mark I to shame.

I wasn’t there, but it gives you the feeling that each computer is a unique, almost hand-crafted machine. Some must have made their odd architectural choices to suit particular functions, others because some designer had a cleaver idea. I’m not a computer historian, but I’m sure that the word lengths must tell a number of interesting stories.

On the whole, though, it gives the impression of a time when each computer was it’s own unique machine, before the convergence of everything to roughly the same architectural ideas. A much more hackery time, for lack of a better word. We still see echoes of this in the people who make their own “retro” computers these days, either virtually, on a breadboard, or emulated in the fabric of an FPGA. It’s not just nostalgia, though, but a return to a time when there was more creative freedom: a time before 64 bits took over.",https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ibm-360-featured.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 11:02:22.098613

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

Investors see Bloom's solid oxide fuel cell as a robust source of power for the surging energy demand caused by the expansion of AI data centers. Bloom's cells operate independently of traditional power grids. They are also highly efficient, emitting only heat and clean water, according to the company.

↑ X NOW PLAYING How The AI Arms Race Is Redefining The Energy Sector In 2026

In its earlier iterations Bloom Energy was viewed as a green energy company, with promising tech, but it struggled with the same skepticism from investors as other climate stocks. However, the continued proliferation of AI has seen it find a new source of demand for its fuel cells.

Now, Bloom Energy is rapidly scaling its manufacturing capacity from 1 gigawatt currently to two gigawatts by the end of 2026, with its existing footprint capable of holding up to five gigawatts of capacity. Analysts see Bloom Energy, and its growing capacity, as a major player in powering data centers amid an expected energy shortfall.

""The company is viewed as an attractive, highly reliable time-to-power solution that will drive rapid volume growth, offering one of the fastest paths to power with the lowest execution risk for AI and data center customers,"" Morgan Stanley analysts noted on Jan. 18.

Bloom Energy did not respond to a request for comment.

Accelerating Profit Growth On These Tailwinds

In late October, the San Jose, Calif.,-based fuel cell manufacturer easily topped third-quarter earnings as revenue swelled 57% vs. a year earlier to $519 million. Adjusted earnings were 15 cents a share vs. a 1-cent loss a year earlier.

Bloom Energy is expected to report fourth-quarter earnings and revenue in early February. Analysts forecast earnings declining 30% to 30 cents per share with sales totaling $647.3 million, up 13.2% vs. a year ago, according to FactSet. However, for the full year, Bloom Energy profit is predicted to grow 93% to 54 cents a share with revenue increasing 30% to $1.91 billion.

""This seminal year for Bloom positions us for an even stronger 2026 and beyond, with higher growth and more profitability,"" Bloom Energy founder and Chief Executive KR Sridhar said on the Oct. 28 third-quarter earnings call.

Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

Sridhar added there are three major tailwinds that Bloom is benefiting from today that have ""created a once-in-a-generation opportunity for us to become the global standard for on-site power generation.""

The CEO said these tailwinds are the AI buildout, federal policy that is pushing the U.S. to win the AI race and the fact that Bloom Energy's product innovation is ""advancing at a pace more akin to semiconductor evolution than to that of traditional industrial products.""

""Bloom is now positioned to become the standard in on-site power, which many of us believe will be a $1 trillion market,"" Sridhar said.

With this backdrop, analysts expect Bloom Energy's 2026 earnings to soar 293% compared to 2024 levels. Through 2030, the Street view has annual profit growing at a steady pace, hitting $6.36 per share at the beginning of the next decade.

Capitalizing On AI Data Center Deals

In 2025, Bloom Energy inked major deals with Brookfield Asset Management (BAM), Oracle and the data center company Equinix (EQIX).

In October, Bloom Energy announced that Brookfield Asset Management will invest up to $5 billion to deploy its fuel cells at AI data centers. Bloom Energy and Brookfield are actively collaborating on the design and delivery of AI factories globally. Brookfield is one of the world's largest AI infrastructure investors and has already invested $50 billion in AI opportunities while tripling the size of its AI strategy over the next three years.

Best IBD 50 Stocks To Watch

CEO Sridhar says Bloom Energy will be the preferred on-site provider for Brookfield's infrastructure portfolio of AI factories, data center operators, corporate facilities and other factories.

The announcement with Brookfield came after Bloom Energy cut a deal in late July with Oracle to supply fuel cell technology for that hyperscaler's AI data centers. Bloom Energy successfully delivered volumes to its first Oracle site within 55 days of the deal announcement vs. a 90-day target commitment.

Bloom Energy Stock Performance

Propelled by these deals, Bloom Energy stock surged nearly 300% last year. Through Jan. 23, Bloom shares have soared 66.7% in the 2026 stock market, leading the way in Investor's Business Daily's Energy-Alternative/Other industry group. The group's 54 stocks have collectively advanced 9.2% so far in 2026, good for 83rd out of the 197 industry groups ranked by IBD.

Bloom Energy is currently trading near record highs and is just below a buy zone from a cup base with a traditional 147.86 buy point, according to MarketSurge charts.

In the past 12 months, dating back to Jan. 23, 2025, Bloom Energy is up almost 424%. For comparison, in that time frame Nvidia is up 27.5% while Oracle has fallen 5%. Fellow Big Tech hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon.com (AMZN) are up 4.3% and 1.6, respectively, since Jan. 23, 2025.

Bloom Energy stock has a perfect 99 Composite Rating. The AI data center energy play also has a 99 Relative Strength Rating and an 80 EPS Rating.

""We have strong traction across all channels of the AI ecosystem,"" Sridhar said on the third-quarter earnings call. ""As we continue to penetrate new geographies and verticals, success builds upon itself and should make each new market entry easier than the first. The opportunity is vast and we are still in the early innings.""

Bloom Energy Starts 2026 With A Bang

The strong Bloom stock move to start 2026 comes as a Wyoming data center project won a key approval earlier this month.

Laramie County commissioners on Jan. 6 reportedly approved site plans for a 1.8-gigawatt data center in Wyoming. Morgan Stanley analyst David Arcaro wrote on Jan. 8 that the proposed project includes 900 megawatts of power generated by fuel cells, with Bloom Energy named as the potential fuel cell provider.

Clean Energy Stock Up 410% In 2025 Jumps After Earnings Beat

The project is expected to start construction in the first quarter of 2026. Arcaro said that 900 megawatts would equate to around $3 billion in product revenue for Bloom Energy vs. the expected 2025 product revenue of $1.45 billion.

Importantly, an unregulated subsidiary of American Electric Power (AEP) executed an unconditional purchase agreement on Jan. 4 to acquire a substantial portion of its option for solid oxide fuel cells to develop and construct a fuel generation facility for about $2.65 billion, according to an AEP regulatory filing. The filing showed there is a 20-year offtake agreement with a ""high investment grade third party consumer"" for 100% of the output of the fuel cell generation facility planned for Cheyenne.

American Electric Power previously partnered with Bloom Energy to deploy up to 1 gigawatt of Bloom's solid oxide fuel cell generators, primarily to power Amazon Web Services data centers.

Analysts' Take On Bloom Energy

Following American Electric Power's key regulatory filing, Clear Street raised its price target on Bloom Energy to 68 from 58, keeping a hold rating on shares. The firm noted that Bloom Energy sales ""should benefit strongly"" this year from a recent customer order of solid oxide fuel cells for a power generation plant in Wyoming.

Meanwhile, Evercore analysts wrote on Jan. 8 that the American Electric disclosure is a ""meaningful positive"" for Bloom Energy as it sheds light on the demand for its product. The firm has an outperform rating and a 152 price target on Bloom shares.

On Jan. 18, Morgan Stanley analysts also compiled a list of 18 ""high conviction thematic stock ideas"" across the U.S. and Latin America. Bloom Energy is one of the stocks.

Morgan Stanley sees Bloom Energy as playing a ""pivotal role in the future of energy, particularly as an enabler of AI infrastructure and a solution to the emerging power bottleneck for data centers.""

According to Morgan Stanley research, there could be a power shortfall of around 45 gigawatts for U.S. data centers through 2028. This is likely to lead to a substantial ramp in data center power demand with lengthy grid interconnection delays with some regions already experiencing five- to seven-year wait times, Morgan Stanley forecasts.

""As grid interconnection times lengthen and traditional power access becomes more constrained, Bloom's fuel cell technology represents a scarce resource in the market alongside U.S.-based solar panels and gas turbines, positioning it as a key beneficiary of the structural shift in how power is delivered to energy-intensive applications,"" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote.

Investing Smarter Via Insurance Recapitalisation To capitalize on this opportunity, investors should: * Monitor insurance stocks and their recapitalisation progress.","Nigeria’s insurance sector is entering a new phase of capital strength following the introduction of the Nigerian Insurance Industry Reform Act (NIIRA) 2025, which mandates higher minimum capital requirements for operators. Beyond regulatory compliance, this wave of recapitalisation is reshaping insurers’ balance sheets, expanding their investment capacity and opening new pathways for stronger, more sustainable investment returns for shareholders and institutional investors alike.

The National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) has consequently set new minimum capital thresholds across the industry: N10 billion for life insurers, N15 billion for non-life insurers, N25 billion for composite insurers and N35 billion for reinsurers. The ongoing recapitalisation exercise is scheduled to conclude on July 30, 2026, giving operators a defined timeline to strengthen their capital base and reposition for growth.

As a result, several insurers have already approached shareholders for capital injections, while others are exploring strategic partnerships, rights issues, and potential mergers to meet the new regulatory thresholds and strengthen their market position.

The recapitalisation drive is expected to increase Investment Capacity with insurers with stronger balance sheets can invest in more substantial and diverse portfolios, potentially generating higher returns.

It will also improve governance and risk management: Enhanced capital requirements promote better governance and risk management practices, reducing the likelihood of insolvency and increasing investor confidence.

To expand insurance penetration: A more robust insurance sector can lead to increased insurance penetration, driving economic growth and creating new investment opportunities.

Looking at key insurance stocks to watch, capital market analysts have said that some insurance stocks that have rallied include: AIICO Insurance, Mutual Benefits Assurance, AXA Mansard Insurance, Linkage Assurance and Cornerstone Insurance.

The commissioner for Insurance/chief executive officer of NAICOM, Segun Omosehin, said the commission’s focus is to build a stronger, more credible insurance market that can protect policyholders and attract long-term investment.

“The recapitalisation and market conduct reforms are designed to ensure that insurance companies are financially sound, well governed and capable of meeting their obligations to policyholders. This will ultimately strengthen confidence in the industry,” Omosehin said.

A senior stockbroker, Tunde Oyediran emphasized that investors who truly understand the dynamics of the capital market must practice patience when it comes to their investments in companies, saying that “those who remain steadfast will likely see significant improvements in their investment portfolios over time.”

He encouraged a long-term perspective, stating, “the key is to stay committed to your company.”

Oyediran also highlighted the substantial untapped potential within the insurance sector, noting that “many Nigerians remain hesitant when it comes to embracing insurance products. This hesitation is a major concern, as effective legislation and enforcement could unlock the industry’s vast capabilities.”

He pointed out that a growing number of insurance firms are now diversifying their operations into various financial sectors, such as asset management and fintech, to solidify and enhance their income streams.

He stated that when the financial performance of these companies improves significantly, the benefits will inevitably extend to their investors in the form of better earnings and attractive dividends.

He mentioned several high-performing stocks in the market, including Custodian Investment Plc, NEM Insurance, Mansard Insurance, and Sunu Assurances, which are currently grabbing the attention of savvy investors seeking growth opportunities.

Investing Smarter Via Insurance Recapitalisation

To capitalize on this opportunity, investors should:

* Monitor insurance stocks and their recapitalisation progress.

* Consider investing in insurers with strong capital positions and growth potential.

* Diversify portfolios to include insurance sector investments.

Money Market

To finance the 2026 budget, the Chief Executive of CFG Advisory, Tilewa Adebajo, has urged the Federal Government to sell off part of its stake in its Joint Venture (JV) assets.

Speaking with journalists during the Finance Correspondents Association of Nigeria (FICAN) 2026 Economic Outlook, the economist warned that Nigeria’s current debt trajectory is unsustainable.

Adebajo who also projected that economic growth could exceed five per cent by the end of the year if urgent fiscal and structural reforms are implemented, said Nigeria’s debt profile, estimated at over $100 billion, poses a serious risk to macroeconomic stability.

Real Estate

The surging cost of house rents across Lagos, Ogun, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Asaba and other major Nigerian cities, amid largely stagnant incomes, is pushing many middle-class Nigerians into severe financial distress and, in some cases, homelessness.

Findings indicate that the cost of renting apartments and renewing leases in Lagos and its neighbouring Ogun communities has risen by more than 200 per cent in the past few years, deepening the housing burden on residents.

Market surveys show that rents for residential flats and small commercial spaces have jumped by over 90 per cent in several Lagos locations, including Lekki, Ajah, Surulere, Festac, Amuwo-Odofin, Apapa and Victoria Island.

Similarly, rents in suburban communities such as Ikotun, Ikorodu, Egbeda, Iyana-Ipaja, Agege, Abule-Egba and Ojodu-Berger have climbed sharply, moving beyond the affordability threshold of lower-income earners.

Maritime

Cargo haulage costs at the Tin Can Island and Apapa seaports in Lagos have dropped by 65.7 per cent, LEADERSHIP can report.

Findings show that the sharp decline is largely due to the introduction of the electronic call-up system, Ètò, operated by Truck Transit Park Limited (TTP), which has significantly improved truck movement and access to the ports.

Maritime experts attributed the reduction in haulage charges to shorter waiting times, faster truck turnaround, and the dismantling of racketeering and illegal checkpoints along port access roads.",https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Insurance.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 14:00:11.137570

Is Adobe (ADBE) Offering Value After A 31% One Year Share Price Decline

January 24, 2026

If you are wondering whether Adobe's current share price reflects its long term potential, it helps to separate the company’s story from what the market is currently willing to pay.

The stock last closed at US$301.07, with returns of 1.7% over 7 days, a 14.7% decline over 30 days, a 9.7% decline year to date, and a 30.8% decline over 1 year, which may have shifted how some investors see its growth prospects and risk profile.

These moves are playing out against a backdrop of ongoing interest in Adobe's core creative and digital media platforms, as investors weigh the long term value of its subscription based model and product ecosystem. Recent coverage has also focused on broader sentiment toward large software names, which can influence how quickly investors are willing to pay up for growth and established market positions.

On our checks Adobe currently scores 5 out of 6 on valuation, as shown by its . Next we will compare the different ways to look at that valuation, before finishing with a different framework that can help you judge whether the market price truly matches your own view of the company.

Approach 1: Adobe Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model projects a company’s future cash flows and then discounts them back to today’s value, so you can compare that estimate to the current share price.

For Adobe, the model used is a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity approach based on cash flow projections. The latest twelve month free cash flow is about $9.8b, and analysts have provided explicit forecasts out to 2030, with Simply Wall St extrapolating further to build a 10 year view. For example, the projections show free cash flow in 2030 of $13.0b, with interim annual estimates such as $10.3b in 2026 and $11.2b in 2027, all in $ and then discounted back to today.

Bringing all those discounted cash flows together, the DCF model arrives at an estimated intrinsic value of about $532.26 per share. Against the recent share price of $301.07, this implies the stock is around 43.4% undervalued according to this framework.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Adobe is undervalued by 43.4%. Track this in your or , or discover .

Approach 2: Adobe Price vs Earnings

For profitable companies like Adobe, the P/E ratio is a useful way to relate what you pay per share to the earnings the business is currently generating. It gives you a quick sense of how many dollars investors are paying for each dollar of earnings.

What counts as a “normal” P/E depends on factors such as expected earnings growth and perceived risk. Higher growth and lower risk often support a higher multiple, while slower growth or higher uncertainty usually call for a lower one.

Adobe currently trades on a P/E of 17.33x. That sits below the Software industry average of 30.76x and well below a peer group average of 55.29x. Simply Wall St’s Fair Ratio framework estimates a P/E of 34.31x for Adobe, based on variables like its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics.

This Fair Ratio aims to be more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry, because it adjusts for company specific factors instead of assuming all software names deserve the same multiple. Compared with the current P/E of 17.33x, the Fair Ratio of 34.31x suggests the shares trade below that model’s implied level.

Result: UNDERVALUED

P/E ratios tell one story, but what if the real opportunity lies elsewhere? .

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose Your Adobe Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way to connect your view of Adobe’s story with the numbers behind its fair value.

A Narrative is your explanation of what you think will happen to a company, written as a story that is backed by your own assumptions for future revenue, earnings and margins, which then link directly into an estimated fair value per share.

On Simply Wall St, millions of investors use Narratives on the Community page as an easy tool to translate their views into financial forecasts, compare the resulting fair value to the current share price and decide whether that gap is significant enough for them to consider buying or selling.

Because Narratives on the platform update when new information such as news or earnings is added, your fair value view can adjust automatically. You might see one Adobe Narrative that assumes a relatively high fair value based on optimistic growth and margins, while another assumes a far lower fair value based on more cautious expectations, even though both are using the same underlying framework.

The collaboration targets productivity gains, faster product development, and stronger national security capabilities across government programs.

The initiative focuses on applying generative AI to areas such as defense, infrastructure, and health services for federal clients.

For investors tracking NYSE:LDOS, this AI partnership arrives as the stock trades around $193.45, with a 1 year return of 31.2% and a 3 year return of 105.2%. Those figures place Leidos in a group of defense and government IT contractors that have seen renewed attention around digital modernization and mission critical technology.

The OpenAI collaboration indicates that AI may be a central theme in how Leidos positions itself with federal agencies going forward.

This OpenAI partnership ties directly into Leidos' focus areas in digital modernization, health services, national security, infrastructure, and defense, which are described as foundations of its NorthStar 2030 growth strategy. For you as an investor, the key angle is how deeply OpenAI's generative and agentic AI is embedded into core federal workflows, since that can influence Leidos' ability to compete for larger and more complex contracts tied to long term modernization programs.

Leidos Holdings Narrative, Now With an AI Twist

There is no formal narrative data attached here, but this announcement may feed into existing investor storylines that already link Leidos to government IT spending, cybersecurity, and digital modernization. If you view Leidos as a contractor closely aligned with U.S. federal priorities, the closer integration of OpenAI tools into both customer workflows and internal processes could reinforce that story around execution on long range technology programs.

Risks and rewards investors should keep in mind

The company is flagged with 4 rewards, including comments that it is trading at 33.4% below one fair value estimate and that earnings grew 16.9% over the past year.

Earnings are also described as forecast to grow 3.77% per year, while the stock is noted as trading at good value compared to peers and the industry.

There is 1 identified risk linked to a high level of debt, which could matter if AI investments or contract delivery require significant ongoing spending.

Management highlights internal productivity gains from thousands of employees already using OpenAI's platform daily, which could support margins if executed carefully.

What to watch next

From here, it is worth watching how often Leidos references OpenAI powered solutions in contract wins, backlog disclosures, and product announcements, as well as any commentary on operational efficiencies from AI use across its workforce.

BENGALURU, Jan 23 (Reuters) – Euro zone business activity growth held steady this month as a weaker expansion in the dominant services industry offset milder factory contraction, according to a survey, while price pressures picked up.

The common ‍currency bloc started the year on a weaker note but sentiment has improved since Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump backed down on additional tariffs he had threatened to impose on eight European countries as leverage to seize Greenland.

The HCOB Flash Eurozone Composite PMI, compiled by S&P Global, held at 51.5 this month but fell short of a Reuters poll forecast for 51.8. It remained ‌above the 50.0 level that separates growth from contraction for a ‌13th straight month.

“Overall, these are decent data, supporting the view of a relatively resilient euro zone economy in the face of multiple shocks and ongoing policy uncertainty,” said Claus Vistesen, chief euro zone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “That said, the bar to meet official and consensus forecasts is ​now higher.”

PRICE PRESSURES BACK ON RADAR

New orders rose at the weakest rate since September and new export business contracted at the quickest pace in four months, suggesting demand remained ‍weak across the board. Firms shed jobs for ​the first time since September.

The services PMI slowed to a four-month ​low of 51.9 from 52.4 in December, lower than the Reuters poll prediction of 52.6.

Manufacturing activity ‍contracted again but at a slower pace.

An index measuring output, which feeds into the composite PMI, barely returned to expansion territory but new orders contracted for a third straight month.

PMIs showed mixed activity across the bloc. In Germany, business activity grew at its fastest pace in three months in January but employment fell at the quickest rate ‍since November 2009.

However, activity in France unexpectedly contracted in January, after two months of meagre growth.

In Britain, a separate PMI showed businesses reported the fastest growth since April 2024. But inflation ‍and joblessness increased, too.

Overall price ‍pressures intensified with input costs rising at the fastest rate ​since February and output charges increasing at the quickest pace in ​nearly two ⁠years, reinforcing expectations the European Central Bank will keep rates ‌steady.

“Even though inflation has remained remarkably benign in recent months despite all the economic turmoil, the PMI does indicate increasing price pressures again,” said Bert Colijn at ING. “That being said, the moves are not nearly enough to sway the ECB from its expectations to hold rates for the foreseeable future.”

Still, optimism about future activity rose to its highest since May 2024.

Le mandat ne sera pas facile, admet Serge Lamontagne.

Le quatrième président-directeur général (PDG) en trois ans à la Société de l'assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ) l’a déjà vécu comme directeur général à la Ville de Laval. L’administration y était gangrenée par la corruption de l’ex-maire Gilles Vaillancourt.

Il devait y faire le ménage, mais il se veut toutefois rassurant: il n’agira pas comme un rouleau compresseur.

«Quand on arrive dans un contexte de tutelle et de corruption, les gens pensent qu’on va faire le ménage. [À Laval], oui, il y a des gens qui sont partis parce que la réorganisation était difficile. Il y en a à qui j’ai demandé de quitter. Mais la transformation s’est faite avec la majorité des gens», a-t-il expliqué, en entrevue avec notre Bureau parlementaire.

Le PDG prendra d’ailleurs le pouls des 5000 employés cette année, conscient que plusieurs sont échaudés par les trois dernières années et la mauvaise presse qui a déferlé à leur endroit.

L’UPAC en tête

Comme pour la SAAQ, Laval faisait l’objet d’enquêtes de l’unité permanente anticorruption (UPAC) à son entrée en fonction. Le nouveau PDG ne compte pas attendre les conclusions du corps de police pour poser des gestes importants.

«À Laval, j’ai travaillé en parallèle avec l’UPAC. Les enquêtes sont longues. Au niveau administratif, je ne peux pas attendre. Il faut avancer sans nuire aux enquêtes. S’il y a des accusations, on prendra acte et on agira en conséquence», dit-il.

«Quand on a un mandat comme ça, il faut scruter le passé, planifier et protéger l’avenir. Ici, le passé a déjà été largement scruté avec la Vérificatrice générale (VG), l’Autorité des marchés publics (AMP), la commission Galant», rappelle-t-il.

D’ailleurs, en écoutant cette commission, M. Lamontagne dit être «tombé en bas de [sa] chaise».

«J’ai été renversé par l’envergure du dossier», signale-t-il, admettant avoir été scandalisé.

Grosses responsabilités

Le nouveau PDG identifie d’ailleurs quatre priorités. D’abord, intégrer l’ensemble des rapports d’enquête afin d’élaborer un plan d’action global et empêcher la répétition des erreurs. Le rapport dévastateur de l’AMP le forcera à montrer patte blanche tous les six mois.

Un concept qu’il apprécie, assure-t-il.

«Les mots clés pour moi: gouvernance, transparence et reddition de comptes», a mentionné le PDG, qui se veut rassurant.

M. Lamontagne souhaite aussi s’attaquer au déficit budgétaire de l’organisation, qui pourrait frôler le milliard de dollars d’ici 2029 en raison de SAAQclic.

Fort de son expérience de gestion, il est convaincu d’y arriver. «On doit retrouver l’équilibre», signale-t-il.

La troisième priorité vise l’amélioration des services aux citoyens et l’optimisation des processus, malgré un système informatique incomplet.

Puis, le nouveau PDG tranchera rapidement la question de la sécurité et de l’armement des contrôleurs routiers. Le ministre des Transports, Jonatan Julien, lui en a donné rapidement la mission.

ISTA’s commitment to responsible AI, coupled with its focus on frontier research and interdisciplinary culture, make it perfectly placed to pursue this goal.

Camp – a philanthropist who is the creator of the not-for-profit Camp.org research organization and co-founder of the ride-hailing Uber app – visited the ISTA campus on January 13 to sign the donation agreement with President Martin Hetzer and Managing Director Georg Schneider.

“With this generous gift, ISTA can further build upon fundamental research in artificial intelligence, drawing on our strengths in computer science, mathematics, and the natural sciences,” said Hetzer. “It helps us pursue AI research within a broad, interdisciplinary scientific context, deepen our understanding of how these systems work, and address their limitations. It is essential for developing robust and trustworthy AI systems that deliver long-term value for both science and society.”

Investment in future breakthroughs

For Camp, the ISTA donation reflects a belief that the next generation of AI breakthroughs will come from ecosystems that prioritize rigor, collaboration, and long-term impact over short-term speed. His current focus is centered around facilitating AI development that helps people thrive around the world.

“Global solutions demand global perspectives and collaboration,” said Camp. “Supporting ISTA is about investing in a community that unites brilliant minds from around the world to further advance trustworthy AI in harmony with humanity and helps to ensure that innovation continues to grow with integrity, transparency, and respect for human values.” Camp has a history of supporting non-profit organizations focused on building responsible and trustworthy AI technology. However, the ISTA gift represents his first contribution to a European research institution.

“We are thrilled to have played a role in helping bring these two institutions together,” said Niklas Schmidt of Wolf Theiss Attorneys-at-Law. “Camp’s donation acknowledges the excellence of the Austrian research landscape.”

ISTA as AI hub

ISTA’s work in AI is wide-ranging and focuses on building systems that are reliable, efficient and scientifically grounded. Key areas include trustworthy AI, with researchers such as Christoph Lampert and his team striving for principled solutions rather than just bug fixes while seeking to make AI safer, as well as more robust, fair and respectful of data privacy.

Sustainable AI is another ISTA focus, with research led by Dan Alistarh aimed at making AI models more resource-efficient and broadly accessible. Francesco Locatello and his team work on causal AI aimed at helping AI systems learn how causes lead to effects, how actions change outcomes and how data they encounter can shift over time.

At ISTA, AI is also closely integrated with other research fields. That includes experimentally aware AI for protein structure prediction. In this area, Alex Bronstein, in collaboration with Paul Schanda, developed a method to ‘guide’ the AlphaFold3 AI model to match experimental data. Monika Henzinger meanwhile pursues work on the privacy-preserving training of large language models while Marco Mondelli and his group have developed rigorous methods for exploiting massive datasets and solving complex inference problems.

Bolstered by the donation, these and other ISTA researchers ­including Krishnendu Chatterjee, Thomas Henzinger, and Matthew Robinson will continue to contribute to AI research that is both scientifically robust and socially responsible.

“We greatly value this transatlantic vote of confidence in ISTA’s research mission and in our role in shaping the future of AI,” Hetzer said. Since opening its doors in 2009, ISTA has attracted scientists from around the world who carry out foundational research spanning the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science across roughly 90 groups, with that number expected to increase to 150 over the next decade.",https://ista.ac.at/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MartinHetzer_GarrettCamp_at_ISTA-1-c-ISTA_V1.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 12:02:10.127797

According to El Periódico Mediterráneo, the Moroccan financier now sits inside the president’s inner circle.

Born in 1984, he studied financial mathematics in France, joined Calyon, then moved to Madrid with Société Générale in 2009. Headed locally by friend Donato González, the bank was Pérez’s main lender before his presidency. His father partnered with Pérez in Moroccan construction projects.

Laghrari left Société Générale in 2013 to become a partner at Key Capital. He helped steady ACS after the failed Iberdrola bid and the property crisis, as the March family and the ‘Albertos’ distanced themselves from Pérez.

He has been involved in Madrid’s Providence and Sixth Street agreements, and in ACS’s purchase of Abertis.

He also advised Joan Laporta and Barcelona.

The club has floated a new CEO to run a subsidiary for business operations, separate from the presidency and sporting side, handling investors, Bernabéu commercial activity and a model valued by Pérez at €10,000 million.

Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer shared his take on. A caller mentioned owning 300 TGT shares and asked for Cramer’s thoughts. He remarked:

I think that you gotta hold on to Target. Got a new CEO… Target seems to find itself in all sorts of trouble all the time. But for the first time in a long time, this stock is bouncing off its low with a 4% yield. I am going to bless you owning Target. Put some on here, and we have 300… maybe even buy another 100 if the stock gets to 100. Let’s have the new CEO on. I really want to speak to him because I’ve been a big Target fan for a very long time.

Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) is a retailer that sells clothing, beauty items, groceries, electronics, home goods, and everyday essentials. Cramer discussed the stock during the November 20, 2025, episode and commented:

Next up, Target, oh jeez, this is a tough one. Target also reported yesterday, and this ailing big box retailer delivered yet another dispiriting set of numbers. We’re talking about a slight revenue miss, a nasty 2.7% decline in same-store sales, and a modest 7 cents earnings beat off a $1.71 basis. On top of that, Target slashed the high end of its full-year earnings forecast.

While we acknowledge the potential of TGT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

How American government subsidizes its ranchers

The federal government allows livestock grazing across an area of publicly owned land more than twice the size of California, making ranching the largest land use in the West. Billions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies support the system, which often harms the environment.

As President Donald Trump’s administration pushes a pro-ranching agenda, ProPublica and High Country News investigated how public lands ranching has evolved. We filed more than 100 public record requests and sued the Bureau of Land Management to pry free documents and data; we interviewed everyone from ranchers to conservationists; and we toured ranching operations in Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Nevada. The resulting three-part investigation digs into the subsidies baked into ranching, the environmental impacts from livestock and the political clout that protects this status quo. Here are the takeaways from that work. The public lands grazing system was modernized in the 1930s in response to the rampant use of natural resources that led to the Dust Bowl — the massive dust storms triggered by poor agricultural practices, including overgrazing. Today, the system focuses on subsidizing the continued grazing of these lands.

The BLM and Forest Service, the two largest federal land management agencies, oversee most of the system. Combined, the agencies charged ranchers $21 million in grazing fees in 2024. Our analysis found that to be about a 93% discount, on average, compared with the market rate for forage on private land. We also found that, in 2024 alone, the federal government poured at least $2.5 billion into subsidy programs that public lands ranchers can access. Such subsidies include disaster assistance after droughts and floods as well as compensation for livestock lost to predators. A small number of wealthy individuals and corporations manage most livestock on public lands.

Roughly two-thirds of the grazing on BLM acreage is controlled by just 10% of ranchers, our analysis found. And on Forest Service land, the top 10% of permittees control more than 50% of grazing. Among the largest ranchers are billionaires like Stan Kroenke and Rupert Murdoch, as well as mining companies and public utilities. The administration released a “plan to fortify the American Beef Industry” in October that instructed the BLM and Forest Service to amend grazing regulations for the first time since the 1990s.

The plan suggested that taxpayers further support ranching by increasing subsidies for drought and wildfire relief, livestock killed by predators and government-backed insurance. The White House referred questions to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which said in a statement, “Livestock grazing is not only a federally and statutorily recognized appropriate land use, but a proven land management tool, one that reduces invasive species and wildfire risk, enhances ecosystem health, and supports rural stewardship.” Roughly 18,000 permittees graze livestock on BLM or Forest Service land, most of them small operations. These ranchers say they need government support and cheaper grazing fees to avoid insolvency.

The final paragraph of Joseph Schumpeter’s chapter-length introduction of his theory of democracy is such a banger

Source: J.A. Schumpter, Capitalism, Socialsm and Democracy. 1943.

For interesting commentary see “Democracy Before, In, and After Schumpeter” Philip Pettit

The classical model of democracy that Schumpeter criticizes is manufactured out of a variety of earlier ideas, not those of any one thinker or even one school of thought. His critique of the central ideals by which he defines the model—those of the common will and the common good—remains persuasive. People’s preferences are too messy and too manipulable to allow us to think that mass democracy can promote those ideals, as he defines them. Should we endorse his purely electoral model of democracy, then, and accept that people do not exercise any control over government? Not necessarily. We can expand democracy to include the constitutional and contestatory constraints that people impose on their rulers. We may hope that people can rely on such democratic controls to ensure that government operates by community standards.

(IBM) approaches a pivotal quarterly report, a notable divergence has emerged between its recent stock performance and analyst sentiment. Despite a significant weekly decline that saw shares lose approximately 15% of their value, closing at €259.25 last Friday, a wave of optimism persists among Wall Street observers. The upcoming financial release on Wednesday, January 28, after the U.S. market close, is now viewed as a critical juncture that could determine whether the technology giant can leverage its strategic initiatives to stabilize its equity value.

All eyes are on the fourth-quarter results, where forecasts are ambitious. Market experts, on average, anticipate earnings per share of $4.31, which would represent a year-over-year increase. Revenue growth is also projected to be robust, with estimates pointing to an advance of nearly 10%. Analysts will scrutinize several key areas: the performance of the software division, recognized as a primary engine for margin expansion; commentary on the planned acquisition of Confluent; and the trajectory of cash flow, which directly impacts the company's dividend sustainability. The report and subsequent guidance for 2026 are expected to set the market's tone for the coming months.

Strategic Moves in AI Fuel Confidence

A primary source of the prevailing positive outlook is IBM's aggressive expansion within the artificial intelligence sector. The company has launched multiple initiatives this week designed to solidify its market position:

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Enterprise Consulting: A new advisory service aimed at helping businesses scale their AI applications built on the watsonx platform.

Grammy Alliance: For the 2026 awards ceremony, IBM will provide a digital AI experience, showcasing its technology to a vast global audience.

Telecom Partnership: In collaboration with telecommunications firm e&, a new solution for governance and compliance has been developed, targeting a high-margin segment of the software market.

Analyst Consensus Defies Recent Price Action

The recent share price correction has not dampened the view from several major investment houses. In January, firms including Jefferies and Bank of America raised their price targets for IBM. Notably, Jefferies upgraded its rating on the stock from ""Hold"" to ""Buy."" The overall consensus among researchers now leans toward a ""Moderate Buy"" recommendation. Out of 19 analysts covering the company, 13 currently advise purchasing the shares.

Market strategists interpret this sustained confidence as an indication that the recent decline is more attributable to a pre-earnings market adjustment rather than a reflection of deteriorating fundamentals. The coming earnings presentation is seen as a potential catalyst to reconcile the disconnect between the stock's recent weakness and the upbeat analyst commentary. Should IBM confirm strong growth in its AI-driven segments and provide a reassuring outlook, it may well validate the current optimism and chart a new course for its shares.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2442574_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 08:59:33.993340

This article originally appeared on Out: AIDS took Ross Laycock 35 years ago.","Memory is a tricky thing.

My friend Felix Gonzalez-Torres once said, ""Each of us perceives things according to who and how we are at particular junctures, whose terms are always shifting.""

So I think, OK, I've had a great life with memories culled from a long list of fantastic, seemingly improbable, some say phantasmagorical experiences and friendships. But for me, it's as though these things happened to someone else, and I only realized how important they were after the fact. I'm not sure if it was naïveté, or my terminally blasé nature, or my Teflon indifference, as one exasperated therapist called it.

One of the few memories that has always felt very real to me dates to my childhood in Canada, when, on cold winter days, with snow drifts like white, ominous mountains enveloping that place I called home, I’d rush from school, lace up my skates, and trudge across the snow drifts, down to the river's edge. Alone, I would skate for miles in the early evening silence, just the schoosh schoosh of the blades on the rock hard ice, the witchy blackness of the early night, and my plumed breath in regular procession.

It is this memory that conjures up Ross Laycock, my indomitable gay brother, the prankster, the exuberant athlete and opera buff, the very embodiment of a certain kind of Canadian sprezzatura. Ross, who like so many, was murdered by Ronald Reagan’s toxic black hair dye and Nancy Reagan’s blood-stained Adolfo dress. By Jesse Helms’s southern-fried homophobia, and New York Mayor Ed Koch’s slammed-shut and padlocked closet door. I’m remembering Ross today, who died of AIDS-related illnesses, 35 years ago on January 24, 1991.

I met Ross in 1978 while we were students at McGill University — he a science major, and me, art history. Then, in the spring of 1980, Ross moved to New York to study menswear design at the Fashion Institute of Technology but soon realized he was not a fit for FIT — that he’d rather buy clothes than design them. I arrived six months later in November. As different as two young gay men could be, I felt deeply bonded to Ross because he represented a kind of unfettered freedom I had never known or understood, and for him, I was the brother he never had.

The first time I saw Ross and Felix together was at a cocktail party in Manhattan in 1983. The two had met a few weeks prior and were already madly in love. It was obvious that Ross had finally found in Felix his ideal man, and Felix had found his “audience of one."" I gave my approval.

Their intense relationship played itself out within the context of Reagan’s America, a time of great difficulty for many people, in particular gay men and lesbians. For some of us, it was also a time of great creativity and profound personal change, of art-making and vibrant activism centered on a spiraling “government-sponsored holocaust” as art critic Darren Jones named it. We opened our hearts and minds and grew in ways we never knew possible, but the tsunami of AIDS came roaring in and threatened to drown us.

Ross came from a family of girls — three sisters, where they all grew up in Inuvik, the Northwest Territories of Canada, in a small village called Norman Wells. I believe there is a kind of spectacular and unique beauty to that place, as he described it, but also boredom and tedium for a young boy. His father died when he was nine, and I know that affected him deeply. His mother, with few options, sent him to what is known in Canada as a ""residential school,"" an awful place, funded by the Canadian government, which forced Indigenous children to not speak their native languages, give up rituals and traditions including clothing, food, hunting, and adornments, and be indoctrinated into the Catholic liturgy. They used torture, starvation, psychological manipulation, and even murder to bend these children to the white man’s way. “Ross, as the only non-Indigenous student at the school, was bullied and abused by other students. I think his confidence, resilience, and charm helped him survive,” his sister Janice remembered. That is the adult Ross that I knew, and the Ross that Felix fell in love with, who he described as “strong as a horse; he could build anything.”

They were in so many ways the most unlikely/likely pair. Felix had been born and raised in Guaimaro, Cuba — the birthplace of the Cuban independence movement, and was separated from his parents in their decision to get him and his siblings out of Cuba as Castro swept into power. This left him feeling unmoored and alone until he eventually landed in New York City where he found a sense of home, something most important to both of them, and which they found in each other.

Ross eventually left New York and returned to Canada to continue his studies in biochemistry at the University of Toronto. He and Felix continued their love affair traveling between New York and Toronto, to Paris, Italy, and spending months in Los Angeles while Felix taught a semester at CalArts. They would spend every summer traveling the northland of Ontario, sleeping in a VW minivan, cooking over an open fire, hiking, swimming, and watching beavers build their dams, while Harry, Ross’s black Labrador, chased squirrels.

Ross became involved with the activist group AIDS Action Now!, and in 1989, organized direct actions at the fifth International AIDS Conference in Montreal, cowriting a manifesto of demands activists issued to the government of Canada as they stormed the stage at the opening plenary session.

I think of Dr. Martin Luther King’s famous phrase: ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."" And it gives me hope. I appreciate the hard-won gains we in the LBGTQ+ community have made in the last 40 years, which were built upon the foundations laid by our brothers and sisters in the 60 years prior. And young people, who are smart and savvy, and seem to have a broad sense of acceptance and love for each other, without judgment, is the very definition of progress. Still, there is more to do.

Thing is, the arc of justice sometimes snaps back, and we find ourselves, once again, facing ugly prejudice, extreme threats of violence, and seemingly impossible odds. Now, hateful anti-trans legislation is being passed in many states, and misogynistic rhetoric spews daily from the Oval Office. We see the current administration canceling World AIDS Day and threatening the highly effective PEPFAR global health initiative, which provided life-saving care to people in developing nations around the world.

We also see pernicious attempts to erase our very existence, and our love, like at recent exhibitions of Felix’s work at the David Zwirner Gallery in New York, the Chicago Art Institute, and the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, where Ross’s name was very intentionally either marginalized, or completely erased from gallery and museum labels and catalogues, along with words like gay, Latino, Cuban, HIV, and AIDS in biographical information about Felix — who was, in fact, all of those things and more.

I know a few things from my years as an artist and activist. Organizing and direct action works, community building works and nonviolent protest works. But mostly I know, even with these setbacks, we will survive.

A 1984 portrait of Carl George by Felix Gonzalez-TorresFelix Gonzalez-Torres / Courtesy Carl George

The last time I saw my friends Ross and Felix together was as a huge pile of candy on a museum floor in New York City. The installation, Untitled (“Lover Boys”) 1991, had an ideal weight of 355 pounds of thousands of shimmering, silver, foil-wrapped candies, and was equal to the weight of the two men combined. Visitors to this installation, which Felix created for the Whitney Museum's 1991 Biennial Exhibition, were invited to take pieces of the candy, and as they did, the pile slowly dwindled — a metaphor for the gradual dissipation of two lives. It forged a charged connection between public dissemination and private ownership, popular discourse and rarified art theory, between the daily lives of gay Americans and the right-wing maelstrom sweeping the nation in the epidemic's early years.

I remember that glorious summer day on Jones Beach when I took the photo of Felix and Ross, bursting with love for each other, looking sexy and glamorous, not a care in the world. But it was not to be. Just a few years later, I gave Ross his last bath, his skeletal body covered with Kaposi’s sarcoma lesions. And soon thereafter, my friend Sharron Campeau and I made funeral arrangements to his exacting specifications; that his ashes be separated into 100 small bags so Felix could carry him everywhere and leave a bit of Ross in the places they both loved.

AMD continues to feature prominently in the competitive landscape with its MI400 accelerators, which analysts expect to be shipped alongside Nvidia systems as aggregate AI server volumes increase.

AMD Targets Mass-Market AI PCs After CES 2026

AMD is positioning itself for the next phase of AI-driven growth by pushing artificial intelligence into mainstream PCs, while relying on its data center business for longer-term momentum, according to Counterpoint Research. The company used CES 2026 to pivot from proof-of-concept demos to mass-market execution, aiming to scale AI features across affordable consumer and commercial PCs, as per the firm.

Major manufacturers, including Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) and HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ), plan to launch AMD-powered AI PCs in early 2026, with entry-level pricing starting at around $499. Counterpoint noted that AMD is emphasizing practical use cases such as productivity, gaming, and creative workloads, a strategy that could help spark a new PC upgrade cycle, particularly in desktops.

Data Centers Remain Core Growth Driver

Counterpoint also highlighted AMD's data center segment as its primary growth engine. Strong hyperscaler demand, tight supply conditions, and rising server CPU adoption are expected to support earnings. At the same time, platform initiatives like Helios could further strengthen AMD's role in AI infrastructure without directly displacing Nvidia.

AMD shares were largely unaffected by Intel Corp.'s (NASDAQ:INTC) quarterly results, which sent Intel stock lower. Intel reported fourth-quarter revenue of $13.67 billion, beating estimates of $13.37 billion, while adjusted earnings of 15 cents per share exceeded expectations. However, revenue declined 4% year over year, and the company guided to breakeven earnings in the first quarter.

AMD Price Action: Advanced Micro Devices shares were up 3.73% at $263.20 at the time of publication on Friday. The stock is trading near its 52-week high of $267.07, according to Benzinga Pro data.

A long-standing player on the continent, Société Générale has been very active since 2015. With its long-standing presence and strong geographical network across the region, the group had chosen to make Africa its priority, establishing itself in 18 countries and building a network of 1,000 branches, driven by its ambition to contribute ever more to the financing of the African economy.

Recent coverage around Kraft Heinz has focused on the company as a large, established player in the packaged foods space. Investors are paying close attention to how consumer brands are being valued in the current market. This context helps frame the recent share price moves as investors reassess how much they are willing to pay for slower growing but established food businesses.

On our valuation checklist, Kraft Heinz scores a 4 out of 6, which suggests several metrics point to the shares being priced below some reference estimates, but not all of them. Next, we will walk through the main valuation approaches behind that score and then finish with a more complete way to think about what the stock might be worth over time.

Approach 1: Kraft Heinz Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

A Discounted Cash Flow, or DCF, model takes the cash Kraft Heinz is expected to generate in the future, then discounts those amounts back into today’s dollars to estimate what the business might be worth right now.

For Kraft Heinz, the latest twelve month Free Cash Flow is about $3.54b. Analysts provide forecasts out to 2028, with Simply Wall St extending those cash flow projections further using its 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. In this framework, Free Cash Flow is projected to be $4.03b in 2035, with each year’s figure discounted back to reflect the time value of money.

Putting all of those discounted cash flows together produces an estimated intrinsic value of US$69.05 per share. Compared with the recent share price of US$22.72, this DCF output suggests Kraft Heinz is trading at roughly a 67.1% discount to that estimate, which indicates that the shares appear undervalued based on this specific model.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Our Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis suggests Kraft Heinz is undervalued by 67.1%. Track this in your watchlist or portfolio, or discover 880 more undervalued stocks based on cash flows.

Approach 2: Kraft Heinz Price vs Sales

For established, profitable consumer brands, the Price to Sales, or P/S, ratio is a useful way to see what investors are paying for each dollar of revenue, especially when cash flow and earnings can be influenced by one off items or accounting choices.

In general, higher growth and lower perceived risk can support a higher P/S multiple, while slower growth and higher risk usually align with a lower, more conservative range that investors might view as normal or fair.

Kraft Heinz currently trades on a P/S ratio of 1.07x. That sits above the wider Food industry average of 0.77x, but below the peer group average of 1.86x. Simply Wall St also calculates a proprietary “Fair Ratio” of 1.33x for Kraft Heinz, which reflects the multiple that could be reasonable given factors such as its earnings profile, industry, profit margins, market value and risk characteristics.

This Fair Ratio is more tailored than a simple comparison with peers or the broad industry because it adjusts for company specific features like growth, risk and profitability, rather than assuming all food companies deserve the same multiple.

Set against this 1.33x Fair Ratio, the current 1.07x P/S suggests Kraft Heinz shares appear undervalued on this measure.

Result: UNDERVALUED

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Kraft Heinz Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives. These are simple stories you create about Kraft Heinz that tie your view of its future revenue, earnings and margins to a financial forecast and then to a fair value you can compare with today’s share price.

On Simply Wall St, Narratives sit inside the Community page and give you a clear framework to say, “Here is how I think Kraft Heinz will perform,” plug that into expected cash flows or earnings, and see the fair value that results from those inputs.

Once you have a Narrative, you can quickly see whether your fair value is above or below the current price. This can help you consider whether Kraft Heinz looks closer to a buy, a hold, or a sell for your own situation, without needing complex spreadsheets.

Narratives are also refreshed when new information comes in, such as earnings releases or major news. This allows your fair value view to stay aligned with what is happening with Kraft Heinz. Different investors can reasonably land on very different fair values, for example one Narrative may see substantial upside while another assumes a more cautious outcome based on lower expected growth or profitability.

A Celebration of Linda’s Life will be held from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, January 31, 2026, at Nelson-Doran Funeral Home in Brainerd.

Linda was born on August 18, 1946, in Brainerd, Minnesota, the daughter of Raymond G. and Bernice L. (Congdon) Johnson. She enjoyed an idyllic childhood growing up on Round Lake as the only daughter—spoiled, or at least very well cared for—by her parents and two brothers.

She graduated from Washington High School in Brainerd in 1965, where she proudly served as a Majorette, and later attended Brainerd Community College (now CLC).

Linda devoted many years to helping others, working as a counselor first at the State Hospital and later at the Port Group Home for Girls. During retirement, she continued to stay busy cleaning homes and lovingly caring for her parents.

Linda was known for her quick wit and sharp sense of humor, as well as her legendary stubborn streak—a trait she happily passed down to her children. She loved gardening and was a wonderful cook, especially known for her boiled dinners and denvers. Above all, Linda cherished time spent with family and friends—whether playing 500, going to the movies with her grandchildren, or calling someone for coffee to start her day off right.

She will be deeply missed by her children, Dana (Randy) Loftis, Dion (Gwen) Lybeck, and David (Kristin) Lybeck; six grandchildren, Preston, Emily, Mariah, Molly, Maguire, and Maxon; three great-grandchildren, Ellanor, Oliver, and Barrett; her brothers, Bernard “Boots” Johnson and Randy “RJ” Johnson; her lifelong friend, Penny Akre; and many extended family members and friends.

She was preceded in death by her parents, Raymond and Bernice Johnson.

SoftBank completed a $22.5 billion forward purchase of OpenAI equity in late December, part of a planned $30 billion commitment in 2025.

While the cash outflow was matched by incoming assets, the valuation used for accounting creates a positive adjustment to equity.

The investment was executed at a $300 billion post-money valuation.

Analysts at BTIG expect SoftBank to carry the stake at OpenAI’s more recent valuation of about $500 billion, implying a roughly 67% uplift on the deployed capital.

Applied to the $22.5 billion tranche, this results in a gross gain of about $15 billion for the quarter.

Not all of that gain accrues to SoftBank shareholders. The position sits within SoftBank Vision Fund 2, where SoftBank retains 83% of the economics, with the remaining 17% attributed to Masayoshi Son. After this split, the gain attributable to shareholders falls to about $12.45 billion.

Analysts say investors must also account for an $8 billion unrealized gain already recognized earlier, tied to the rising value of the forward contract itself. Subtracting that amount avoids double counting and brings the net increase in equity and net asset value to about $4.45 billion.

Based on this adjustment, BTIG estimates SoftBank’s fair value mark for its OpenAI holding at $54.9 billion. That figure reflects the prior carrying value at the end of the second fiscal quarter, the December $22.5 billion investment, an earlier $1.45 billion capital infusion in October, and the newly calculated equity gain.

BTIG estimates SoftBank’s total net asset value at about $189 billion after the adjustment, making OpenAI roughly 30% of the group’s NAV. By comparison, BTIG noted that OpenAI represents less than 5% of Microsoft’s market capitalization.

BTIG has a Buy rating on SoftBank Group and a ¥5,400 price target, based on a sum-of-the-parts valuation that applies a holding company discount to net asset value.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEL4K0QW_L.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 10:00:23.419061

Instead, Costco Cash Rewards from Citi are issued as part of the February credit card billing statement.
The Costco Anywhere Visa Card cashback rewards for other purchases remain unchanged.
As before, the Costco Anywhere Visa Card carries no annual fee, which is a great perk for a credit card.
The Costco Cash Rewards from Citi that cardholders are about to receive in February will expire on December 31 this year.","Costco members who also have the Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi will be happy to hear the retailer has increased the cashback rates on gas purchased at Costco stations to 5%. The old 4% rate still applies to gas and EV charging elsewhere. Costco quietly increased the cashback rate in January 2025, as noted by NerdWallet on January 19. Both Citi co-branded Costco cards (Costco Anywhere Visa and Costco Anywhere Visa Business) got the upgrade. That said, the reason Costco's credit card upgrade is getting more attention in early 2026 may be tied to the imminent arrival of the cash rewards. Also, last year's change may have gone largely unnoticed, especially as Costco didn't run ad campaigns around the new perk.

Importantly, the cashback credit isn't available to users immediately. Instead, Costco Cash Rewards from Citi are issued as part of the February credit card billing statement. Rewards of $300 or more are eligible for direct deposit, while those under $300 must be redeemed in Costco stores for merchandise, cash, or check. Put differently, Costco members who have been pumping gas at Costco since mid-January 2025 will receive 5% cashback for their gas purchases in a few weeks. They may notice the difference.

The maximum cashback applies to the first $7,000 spent per year on gas and EV charging. After that, the rate drops to 1%. Costco's upgrade means consumers can earn as much as $350 instead of the previous $280 if the first $7,000 spent on Costco gas is with the Citi card. The cashback amount will be lower than $350 if they use the card for gas and EV charging from non-Costco locations.

In comments made last month during Costco's Q1 2026 earnings call, Costco's CFO Gary Millerchip mentioned the increased cashback rewards for gas as he explained the retailer is looking to ""improve the value of the membership"" going forward. ""We've made some major changes recently with the extended opening hours and the Instacart benefits and 5% gas on the credit card, but we'll continue to look for ways to add greater membership value,"" Millerchip said. In September, during the company's Q4 2025 earnings call, Costco CEO Ron Vachris said the retailer had a ""record year for gas volumes."" The longer gas station hours, new gas stations, and expansions of existing gas stations are the factors he cited for the growth.

The Costco Anywhere Visa Card cashback rewards for other purchases remain unchanged. Cardholders will get 3% on dining and eligible travel, 2% for purchases in Costco stores and on Costco.com, and 1% cashback on other purchases. As before, the Costco Anywhere Visa Card carries no annual fee, which is a great perk for a credit card. However, the card is only available to Costco members, which means you'll have to pay $65 a year for a Gold Star membership or $130 a year for the executive tier.

That said, the credit card's cashback rewards are a compelling reason to get a Costco membership. It's an easy way to score extra savings on all sorts of products, including iPhones bought at Costco – not just gas. The Costco Cash Rewards from Citi that cardholders are about to receive in February will expire on December 31 this year.",https://www.bgr.com/img/gallery/costco-made-a-big-credit-card-change-members-will-love/l-intro-1769216942.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 05:59:42.593132

“Nonetheless, the HCOB flash PMIs showed a modest improvement in manufacturing, whereas activity in the services sector weakened ‍notably at the start of the year. The prospect of a resolution over the 2026 national budget offers some relief, as it reduces the risk ‍of a renewed political ‍crisis in the near term,” he said.

French Prime Minister ​Sebastien Lecornu earlier this week used a special ​constitutional power ⁠to force part of his 2026 budget bill ‌through the deeply divided lower house of parliament without a vote, bringing France closer to getting a 2026 budget.

Last month, the INSEE national statistics agency forecast France’s economy, the euro zone’s second-largest, to post moderate growth in early 2026, with resilient household spending offsetting weaker foreign trade.

Find .

What Is Hormel Foods' Investment Narrative?

To be comfortable owning Hormel today, you really have to believe in the durability of its brands and the company’s ability to translate modest sales growth, disciplined capital allocation and product innovation into steadier profitability over time. Recent results show pressured margins, relatively low returns on equity and a share price that has lagged both the broader market and food peers, so near term, the key catalysts remain any signs of earnings improvement, better international profitability and proof that new products like premium and convenience offerings can support pricing. Domenic Borrelli’s appointment fits into this story as a potential boost to retail execution and brand building, but it is unlikely to shift the short term earnings picture on its own. The bigger risks are valuation, weaker margin trends and a dividend that is not well covered by current earnings.

However, one risk that often gets less attention could matter more than investors expect. Hormel Foods' shares have been on the rise but are still potentially undervalued by 48%. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five Simply Wall St Community fair value views span roughly US$24.36 to US$47.20, reflecting wide expectations. Against that backdrop, concerns about thin dividend cover and soft margins may weigh on how confidently you view Hormel’s ability to support both income and reinvestment.

On January 20, WSJ reported that the company is investing $150 million in Baseten, a startup that specializes in AI inference. Baseten has raised $300 million at a $5 billion valuation. This deal demonstrates NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s aggressive push into startups that are focused on inference amid the industry’s shift from training models to powering them at scale, noted WSJ.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) paid $20 billion in December to license the AI-inference technology from startup chip designer Groq. This deal reflected its hunger for cutting-edge chips, which can help speed up the model responses. Notably, Baseten is also engaged in providing support for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s Nemotron 3 Nano, a high-accuracy and high-efficiency open AI model.

In a separate update, on January 12, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Eli Lilly and Company announced a first-of-its-kind AI co-innovation lab, which is focused on applying AI to tackle some of the most enduring challenges in the broader pharmaceutical industry. The two companies plan to invest up to $1 billion in talent, infrastructure, and compute over 5 years to help the new AI co-innovation lab.

Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?","A recent regulatory filing has cast a shadow over Kraft Heinz, raising the prospect of a major shareholder exodus. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, long viewed as a bedrock of stability for the packaged food giant, has indicated plans that could lead to a complete divestment of its substantial stake. As investors assess the implications of this potential move, the company also faces mounting pressure from rising commodity costs.

Beyond the uncertainty surrounding its shareholder base, Kraft Heinz is confronting tangible challenges in its supply chain. Severe cold weather events in the United States and the Black Sea region have triggered a short-term spike in agricultural commodity prices. Notably, wheat prices have advanced as market participants anticipate potential crop damage from ""winterkill"" conditions.

For consumer staples companies like Kraft Heinz, elevated input costs directly compress profit margins. This creates a significant financial constraint in a market where consumers remain highly sensitive to price increases on supermarket shelves.

The $7 Billion Overhang

The dominant concern for investors stems from a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 20. The filing outlines Berkshire Hathaway's potential sale of up to 325.4 million shares. This block represents the entirety of the conglomerate's 27.5% ownership position in Kraft Heinz.

Under the leadership of CEO Greg Abel, Berkshire appears to be continuing a strategic portfolio rationalization that in recent years has included trimming positions in companies like Apple and Bank of America. The mere possibility of shares worth approximately $7.7 billion entering the market acts as a substantial overhang on the stock price. Such a large potential supply typically suppresses any near-term recovery in a company's equity.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?

Financial institutions have responded swiftly to the combination of potential selling pressure and operational risks. Firms including BNP Paribas, Jefferies, and JPMorgan have lowered their price targets ahead of earnings, with new objectives set in a range between $22 and $24 per share. These adjustments reflect widespread skepticism that the stock can stage a meaningful rebound in the short term.

Recent trading activity underscores this cautious outlook:

* Friday's Closing Price: $22.45

* 12-Month Performance: -19.56%

* Cushion Above 52-Week Low: A mere 9.30%

The share price now trades perilously close to its critical 52-week low of $20.54.

Awaiting the Financial Report

Market attention now turns to February 11, 2026, when Kraft Heinz is scheduled to release its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results before the market opens. While the stock currently offers a dividend yield of roughly 7%, the looming threat of a massive sale by its largest shareholder forces investors to judge whether this represents a genuine value opportunity or a classic ""value trap."" The upcoming earnings report will be crucial in determining if the company's underlying business is sufficiently robust to withstand the potential departure of its anchor investor.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2442124_100_100.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 22:58:30.687622

Silver and gold prices rose Friday, helped by sustained safe-haven demand amid lingering geopolitical risks.

Silver gained 6.42% to ₹3,18,960 per kg in the retail market, recovering from the previous day's fall. Gold rose 3% to ₹1,55,428 per 10 gm. With goods & services tax of 3%, a consumer has to shell out ₹1,60,090 per 10 gm of gold and ₹3,28,528 per kg of silver.

In the international market gold and silver surged to fresh all-time highs, with gold touching $4,970 a troy ounce and silver hitting $99.2 per troy ounce, marking also their strongest weekly performance since March 2020.

Volatility in prices is keeping consumers away from the physical market for the previous metals, putting the small and medium jewellers in trouble.

Market sentiment has been influenced also by US President Donald Trump's statement that he had secured permanent US access to Greenland through a NATO deal, though details remain unclear, and Denmark has reiterated its sovereignty. Trump also cancelled proposed tariffs on European imports, with the EU agreeing to suspend countermeasures while seeking clarity on future policy direction.

Live Events

Expectations of monetary easing in the US have also grown, as Trump is expected to appoint the next Federal Reserve chair, with markets pricing in a dovish candidate.

What Is Best Buy's Investment Narrative?

To own Best Buy, you have to believe that a mature, slower growing electronics retailer can still create value by squeezing more from its stores, services, and digital channels rather than chasing rapid expansion. The recent holiday update, with stronger demand in computing, gaming and mobile alongside better digital sales, slightly improves the near term picture for comps and supports management’s raised fiscal 2026 earnings guidance, but the stock’s muted short term returns suggest the market is not treating this as a game changer. Key catalysts now sit around whether that holiday strength shows up clearly in the upcoming fourth quarter numbers and margins, and whether e-commerce momentum can offset softer big ticket demand and tariff pressure. The biggest risk is that higher dividends and one off charges stretch already thin profit coverage if sales soften again.

However, one risk around dividend sustainability and thin margins is something investors should not ignore. Despite retreating, Best Buy's shares might still be trading above their fair value and there could be some more downside. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Six fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$53 to over US$140 per share, showing just how far apart individual views can be. Set against the recent holiday boost in computing and gaming and the ongoing pressure on margins and dividend cover, this wide range underlines why it helps to weigh multiple perspectives on Best Buy’s prospects before deciding what its shares are really worth.

Thyssenkrupp prüft den Verkauf einer Minderheitsbeteiligung an der Wälzlagersparte Rothe Erde. Das berichteten zwei mit der Angelegenheit vertraute Personen am Freitag. Die Nachricht kommt nicht völlig überraschend, denn die Essener erhalten nach eigenen Angaben regelmäßig Angebote für verschiedene Transaktionsmöglichkeiten.

Konkret geht es um rund 30 % der Anteile an Rothe Erde. Die Sparte, die zum Geschäftsbereich Thyssenkrupp Decarbon Technologies gehört, könnte dabei mit etwa 1,5 Milliarden Euro bewertet werden. Das entspricht umgerechnet rund 1,8 Milliarden Dollar. Für einen Konzern, der sich seit Jahren in der Umstrukturierung befindet, wäre das ein nicht zu unterschätzender Betrag.

Profitable Sparte lockt Interessenten an

Thyssenkrupp selbst äußerte sich vorsichtig zu den Spekulationen. In einer offiziellen Stellungnahme hieß es, Rothe Erde sei ein profitables Unternehmen und ein interessantes Asset innerhalb des Konzerns. Deshalb würden regelmäßig Angebote für verschiedene Transaktionsmöglichkeiten eingehen. Man halte alle Optionen offen und prüfe die jeweiligen Angebote, so der Konzern weiter.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Thyssenkrupp?

Diese Formulierung lässt durchaus Spielraum für Interpretationen. Einerseits wird die Profitabilität der Sparte betont, andererseits macht man keinen Hehl daraus, dass man grundsätzlich verkaufsbereit ist. Die Frage ist nur: Zu welchem Preis und unter welchen Bedingungen? Ein Teilverkauf würde Thyssenkrupp einerseits frisches Kapital bringen, andererseits aber auch die Kontrolle über eine profitable Einheit behalten.

Für Anleger bleibt abzuwarten, wie schnell sich hier konkrete Entwicklungen ergeben. Die Bewertung von 1,5 Milliarden Euro klingt ambitioniert, zeigt aber auch, dass Rothe Erde offenbar ein begehrtes Asset ist. Sollte der Deal zustande kommen, könnte das der Aktie neuen Schwung verleihen.

The product can be traded on Nasdaq.

Cryptocurrency ETFs receive new orders.

Grayscale, one of the largest digital asset investment managers, has taken another step to expand its presence in the cryptocurrency ETF market by filing a new registration request with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The proposal involves the launch of the Grayscale BNB ETF, an exchange-traded fund focused on the BNB token, linked to the Binance ecosystem.

According to document submitted to the SEC On Friday, the fund was structured to maintain direct exposure to the digital asset. According to the filing, the ETF “will hold 'BNB', which are digital assets based on an existing open-source cryptographic protocol on the BNB Smart Chain, comprising units that constitute the underlying assets of the fund's shares.” The description details how the product works and reinforces the focus on direct custody of the token.

BNB is the native token of the BNB Chain, a blockchain associated with Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the global market. The asset is among the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and is widely used for fees, decentralized applications, and services within the network's ecosystem.

If it receives regulatory approval, the Grayscale BNB ETF will be traded on Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the ticker symbol GBNB. The filing designates Bank of New York Mellon as the transfer agent for the fund, while Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC, has been designated as the custodian of the digital assets, reinforcing the product's institutional structure.

Grayscale is not the first to seek an ETF linked to BNB. In May 2025, VanEck had already presented a similar proposal, which puts the asset manager in direct competition for space in a segment still in formation in the US market. The move occurs amidst a broader expansion of cryptocurrency ETFs, favored by a regulatory environment considered more receptive in the United States.

In recent months, funds linked to tokens such as Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, Hedera, and Chainlink have begun to integrate into the ETF market. Grayscale itself has already listed products linked to Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin, and Chainlink, in addition to maintaining an active strategy of converting closed-end funds into ETFs. This week, the asset manager also signaled its intention to transform its fund linked to Near into an ETF, reinforcing its continued commitment to expanding its portfolio of cryptocurrency-related products.",,N,,2026-01-24 05:59:34.729275

He found that amyloid PET scans taken after the initial treatment period, and again before therapy resumed in the OLE, looked much the same.
Tau pathology may be related to denser, more treatment-resistant plaques that are harder to remove.","23 Jan 2026

The 2026 Human Amyloid Imaging conference, held January 12–14, marked its second year in San Juan, Puerto Rico, following a 14-year run in Miami and some years of roving before that. The gathering featured 144 posters, 35 podium presentations, and one rather tricky quiz. Who knew Alois Alzheimer’s Ph.D. dissertation was on ear wax? Very few HAI attendees did. Nor, as it turns out, did your humble correspondent. Despite its amyloid-centric title, HAI spanned a broad range of topics and sparked lively discussion—for example on how best to quantify tau PET, what a plasma p-tau217 number means about risk for AD in cognitively normal people, and how to use AI to interpret amyloid scans.

One hot topic: postmortem analysis of trial data. It’s been just over 15 years since anti-amyloid antibodies first entered clinical trials, and five years since they reached clinical practice and data started trickling in from people who braved the first such therapies but have since passed away. Unlike PET imaging, postmortem pathology affords a granular view of what anti-amyloid antibodies are—and are not—accomplishing in a person’s brain. So far, the picture looks mixed: Some groups report amyloid clearance across the cortical expanse, while others find the effect to be patchy. What explains the difference is unclear; suspicion currently rests on baseline tau pathology.

One case that drew much attention at HAI came from David Wolk of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. He described a 52-year-old man who sought care at the UPenn Alzheimer Disease Research Center after three years of worsening forgetfulness. Genetic testing revealed that he carried the TREM2 R47H variant, a mutation that raises Alzheimer’s disease risk three- to fourfold—about the same as carrying one ApoE4 allele.

On a PET scan, the man’s amyloid centiloid value was 139, a heavy burden. He enrolled in the EMERGE Phase 3 trial and received 16 doses of aducanumab over 22 months. After a 20-month gap, when the initial trial was discontinued following a futility analysis, he entered the open-label extension EMBARK, and received an additional 14 doses (Budd Haeberlein et al., 2022). On his final amyloid PET scan, he was still positive, but at a much reduced 33 centiloids.

His thinking and memory, as staged by the MMSE, held steady during EMBARK and for a couple more years afterward. Over time, thinking and daily functioning began to decline, and he developed trouble walking, becoming stiff and unsteady, like someone with Parkinson’s disease. He entered hospice care and died four and a half years after he had received his last dose of aducanumab.

This trial participant donated his brain to UPenn, where staining for amyloid with the NAB228 antibody showed that plaques were completely absent from the outer layers of his cortex and had also been cleared from deeper layers in some entire gyri—the brain’s curved ridges. In adjacent sulci, however, substantial amyloid remained, particularly in deeper cortical layers.

What explains this pattern? Wolk suspected tangles might be involved. To investigate, he assessed tau pathology with the PHF-1 antibody, which detects phosphorylation at S396/S404. This revealed a strikingly similar picture. Areas with extensive amyloid clearance, the gyri, had little to no detectable phosphorylated tau, while nearby sulci where amyloid had persisted were laden with phosphorylated tau. Slides showing this clear demarcation can be found in the HAI program book, but Wolk would not allow Alzforum to show them here.

Why this difference between the gyri and the sulci? Wolk thinks that regions where amyloid had been vanquished might have been spared from tau accumulation. “I think this primarily shows that in the absence of amyloid these brain regions seem to have not developed tau pathology despite the patient having not been on medicine for around four years, and despite these areas being in close proximity to regions with limited clearance of amyloid and significant amyloid and tau pathology,” Wolk told Alzforum. “It is also possible that some tau was removed in these regions also, but we cannot say that with certainty” he added.

“This shows how much we still have to learn about the biological effects of these therapies, and how important autopsy cases are for advancing our understanding,” said Gil Rabinovici of the University of California, San Francisco.

Considering four and a half years had passed between amyloid removal and autopsy, Rabinovici wondered if the staining pattern truly reflected differences in amyloid clearance between gyri and sulci, or whether some areas simply reaccumulated amyloid more quickly once treatment had ceased.

“That’s possible,” said Wolk. He noted that at CTAD last year, Lindsay Welikovitch from Brad Hyman’s group at Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, had calculated, based on time to autopsy, that amyloid plaques can slowly return after treatment stops, with burden rising over several years and tracking time off drug (Dec 2025 conference news). Indeed, Eisai has reported that cognition begins to worsen and amyloid PET signal rebounds after people stop taking lecanemab (Aug 2024 conference news). Likewise, people who had tested amyloid-negative during the Trailblazer-Alz2 trial and were taken off donanemab during the open-label extension began to reaccumulate amyloid at rates typically seen in untreated AD (Aug 2025 conference news).

To Christopher Brown, a postdoc in Wolk’s lab, reaccumulation seems less likely. He found that amyloid PET scans taken after the initial treatment period, and again before therapy resumed in the OLE, looked much the same. The gap between scans was only a year and a half; still, the images argue against amyloid springing back up in these regions, at least during this period, Brown said.

Joseph Masdeu of Houston Methodist Hospital asked if tau might only appear to be missing because its epitopes were masked by activated microglia. Wolk called this unlikely. He found that regions rich in tau contained activated-looking microglia and astrocytes, but in areas where amyloid had been cleared with no apparent tau pathology, glial morphology more closely resembled that of homeostatic microglia in healthy brain tissue. “This is an indication that the brain was getting back to normal,” said Wolk.

Scientists don’t know how representative this normalization might be among people who took aducanumab. Welikovitch had reported at CTAD that activated microglia and astrocytes persisted even after amyloid had been removed (Dec 2025 conference news).

Wolk’s findings also contrasted with those of Baayla Boon of the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, who at HAI showed postmortem data from participants in the ENGAGE trial of aducanumab. In four cases, Boon found that plaques were nearly completely cleared from the upper layers of the cortex, though not across entire gyri. She had already presented this data at AAIC last year (Aug 2025 conference news).

Boon presented no tau data at HAI, but told Alzforum that she had stained postmortem tissue from these same four cases for p-tau using the AT8 antibody, which detects phosphorylation at serine 202 and threonine 205, and broadly labels both pretangle fibrils and mature tangles. She found abundant phospho-tau in superficial cortical layers where amyloid had been cleared (image below).

Why did tau pathology persist in Boon’s cases but not Wolk’s case? Boon said the different antibodies used might make a difference but, more importantly, she saw less plaque clearance than Wolk did. It could be that plaques need to be completely gone before the brain can take on tangles, she suggested.

A separate question is why immunotherapy removed plaques in some brain regions but not others. Matteo Tonietto of Hoffmann–La Roche in Basel, Switzerland, offered an explanation. His group asked whether baseline tau pathology influenced amyloid removal in people treated with gantenerumab. He drew on data from the Phase 3 GRADUATE trials, which ran from 2018 to late 2022. At HAI, Tonietto focused on 38 participants in the treatment group who’d had a tau PET scan at baseline, along with amyloid scans at baseline and again at the end, 116 weeks later.

Scrutinizing the scans region by region, the scientists became aware of a theme. Areas that already had more tangles at baseline tended to have less amyloid clearance during treatment, while areas that started out with a lighter tangle load saw more plaque removal (image below).

Regional Roadblock. Baseline tau levels plotted against treatment-related amyloid change, with each dot representing a different brain region. [Courtesy of Matteo Tonietto.]

Tonietto proposed two reasons why tau might influence amyloid removal. Tau pathology may be related to denser, more treatment-resistant plaques that are harder to remove. Tau pathology might also push microglia into a pro-inflammatory state that is ill-suited for clearing amyloid.

Mike Pontecorvo, who retired from Eli Lilly last year, echoed the latter idea. He suggested that when a person carries a high tau burden, their microglia may become overloaded and dysfunctional. Or both.—George Heaton

“Last year was a year of transformation where we laid the groundwork for the next chapter of Alaska Air Group,” CEO Ben Minicucci told investors Friday.

Alaska’s competitors faced some of the same headwinds and saw their profits climb year over year. Alaska, though still profitable in 2025, saw its profits drop 70% compared with the year before. Despite the rocky results, Alaska executives are still optimistic about the carrier’s expansion plans, sticking to long-term vision to boost revenue, reach new customers and turn its hometown Seattle hub into a global gateway by 2030.

On a Friday call with investors, Alaska executives said an industrywide drop in demand contributed to their decreased earnings, while acknowledging Alaska-specific issues such as “friction” in integrating the newly acquired Hawaiian Airlines and high real estate costs as the carrier expands.

“Last year was a year of transformation where we laid the groundwork for the next chapter of Alaska Air Group,” CEO Ben Minicucci told investors Friday. “It did not come without growing pains.”

Alaska Air Group — which includes Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines, as well as regional carrier Horizon Air and ground support company McGee Air Services — saw profits drop 74% in 2025 compared with the year prior, from $395 million to $100 million.

For the fourth quarter, which ended in December, profits dropped 70% year over year, from $71 million to $21 million.

Delta, meanwhile, saw a 44% jump in profit from 2024 to 2025, while United saw a nearly 7% increase.

All three carriers saw revenue growth, with Alaska increasing full-year operating revenue 21% compared with 2024, while United reported 3.5% growth and Delta 2.8%.

In an interview ahead of the earnings release Thursday, Alaska’s head of investor relations Ryan St. John said the biggest factor in Alaska’s 2025 results was a slump in demand that started in February and continued into the summer travel season.

Demand picked up again in the second half of the year, with a temporary slowdown in the fall during the government shutdown and resulting mandate to cut flights. Since then, St. John said, demand has continued to rebound this year, with Alaska recording some of its highest booking days in its history this month.

On Friday, Alaska executives again attributed much of the year’s performance to economic factors out of their control. On top of the change in demand, company leaders focused on volatile fuel prices on the West Coast, where there are few refineries available to provide the jet fuel carriers need. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport felt that firsthand in November, when a leak in the Olympic Pipeline forced airlines to turn to contingency plans to make sure flights kept operating smoothly.

For Alaska, a 10-cent change in fuel prices can result in a 75-cent change for the carrier’s earnings per share, Chief Financial Officer Shane Tackett said.

“We really need the West Coast refineries to stabilize. They just are not up and operating consistently enough,” Tackett said.

The airline is planning to work with communities and federal agencies to “smooth out” the issues with existing refineries and find new ways to bring more fuel to the West Coast, Tackett continued. But it would take a few years to get that initiative in place.

Alaska’s full year financial results included about $100 million of “transient ” costs that won’t occur in future quarters, Tackett told investors. He pointed to market labor agreements and increased real estate costs incurred as Alaska expands.

“Real estate costs continue to be the highest costs,” Tackett said. “All the investments that were necessary but being made in the core hubs, there is a cost reality that comes with that.”

All of the Alaska executives who spoke with The Seattle Times and with investors this week said the company has successfully integrated Hawaiian Airlines into its operations this year, checking several major milestones off its to-do list after completing its acquisition in September 2024.

But Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Harrison acknowledged Friday that the acquisition introduced some challenges that affected the company’s 2025 results.

“2025’s progress was slowed by macroeconomic challenges, and integration friction,” he said.

Most of the heavy lifting is now complete, Alaska said, including launching a joint loyalty program and receiving a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration. Alaska is still in the midst of transitioning to a single booking platform, but has already started using the new system to book future flights. In April, it will finalize the transition.

This year, Alaska also faced two significant IT outages caused by failures in the company’s data centers. In October, after the second disruptive outage, it hired consulting firm Accenture to evaluate its IT infrastructure.

On Friday, Minicucci and Tackett said the airline is investing in more resiliency and redundancy to its systems to prevent another breakdown.

“We’re making headway,” Tackett said. “We’ve got a lot of detailed plans ready to execute in the first quarter. We spent a good amount of time in the fourth quarter understanding what we need to do.”

The company has included those IT investments in its projections for 2026, Tackett said.

Alaska issued a wide range of guidance for next year — expecting earnings per share for the full year somewhere between $3.50 and $6.50. That’s a steep jump from 2025, which saw 18 cents earnings per share.

Facing several questions from analysts about that expansive range, Alaska leaders said they’ve baked in room for another year of economic pressures.

The best-case scenario assumes Alaska continues to reap rewards of its merger with Hawaiian and eliminates the one-time costs it faced this year. The worst-case scenario factors in another “deceleration” of demand and high fuel prices.

“Change can occur quickly in either direction,” Tackett said.

Analysts from JPMorgan Chase agree the airline faced external pressure in 2025 and is prepared to turn it around this year, they wrote in a note to investors Friday.

“There’s little doubt 2026 is starting off on the right foot,” the analysts wrote. “In Alaska’s case, their conservatism appears to be driven more by, well, conservatism … likely shaped by the tumultuous year the industry just experienced.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01232026_TZR_Alaska_Airlines_Anchorage-2025-AP_tzr_.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-23 22:01:06.369801

If we make such adjustment, the fractional undivided interest per Unit will vary from the amount indicated above. (2) The Public Offering Price shown above reflects the value of the Securities on the business day prior to the Initial Date of Deposit. The price you pay for your Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units. (3) You will pay a maximum sales charge of 1.85% of the Public Offering Price per Unit (equivalent to 1.88% of the net amount invested) which consists of an initial sales charge and a creation and development fee. Investors will not be assessed a sales charge on the portion of their Units represented by cash deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs and creation and development fee. (4) Each FLEX Option is generally valued based on the last quoted sale price where readily available and appropriate as discussed under ""Public Offering- The Value of the Securities."" On the Initial Date of Deposit, the evaluations for purposes of determining the purchase, sale or redemption price of Units will be at 2:30 p.m. Eastern time (the ""Initial Evaluation Time""). Subsequent to the Initial Date of Deposit, evaluations will be made as of the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each day on which it is open (the ""Evaluation Time""). (5) The Net Asset Value per Unit figure reflects the deduction of the creation and development fee and estimated organization costs, which will be deducted from the assets of the Trust at the end of the initial offering period. The Redemption Price per Unit does not reflect the deduction of such creation and development fee and estimated organization costs. See ""Redeeming Your Units."" (6) See ""Amending or Terminating the Indenture."" Page 3 Fee Table (Unaudited) This Fee Table describes the fees and expenses that you may, directly or indirectly, pay if you buy and hold Units of the Trust. See ""Public Offering"" and ""Expenses and Charges."" Although the Trust has a term of approximately 15 months, and is a unit investment trust rather than a mutual fund, this information allows you to compare fees. Amount per Unit ________ Unit Holder Sales Fees (as a percentage of public offering price) Maximum Sales Charge Initial sales charge 1.36%(a) $.138 Creation and development fee 0.49%(b) $.050 _____ _____ Maximum sales charge (including creation and development fee) 1.85% $.188 ===== ===== Organization Costs (as a percentage of public offering price) Estimated organization costs .372%(c) $.0380 ===== ====== Estimated Annual Trust Operating Expenses(d) (as a percentage of average net assets) Portfolio supervision, bookkeeping, administrative and evaluation fees .077% $.0080 Trustee's fee and other operating expenses .145%(e) $.0150 _____ ______ Total .222% $.0230 ===== ====== Example This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Trust with the cost of investing in other investment products. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Trust for the periods shown. The example also assumes a 5% return on your investment each year and that the Trust's operating expenses stay the same. The example does not take into consideration transaction fees which may be charged by certain broker/dealers for processing redemption requests. Although your actual costs may vary, based on these assumptions your costs, assuming you sell or redeem your Units at the end of each period, would be: 1 Year 15 Months ______ _________ $249 $255 The example will not differ if you hold rather than sell your Units at the end of each period. ________________ (a) The ""transactional sales charge"" consists entirely of an initial sales charge, deducted at the time of purchase. The initial sales charge is actually equal to the difference between the maximum sales charge of 1.85% and the amount of any remaining creation and development fee. Investors will not be assessed a sales charge on the portion of their Units represented by cash deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs and creation and development fee. (b) The creation and development fee compensates the Sponsor for creating and developing the Trust. The creation and development fee is a charge of $.050 per Unit collected at the end of the initial offering period, which is expected to be one day from the Initial Date of Deposit. If the price you pay for your Units exceeds $10.226 per Unit, the creation and development fee will be less than 0.49%; if the price you pay for your Units is less than $10.226 per Unit, the creation and development fee will exceed 0.49%. If you purchase Units after the initial offering period, you will not be assessed the creation and development fee. (c) Estimated organization costs, which include a one-time licensing fee, will be deducted from the assets of the Trust at the end of the initial offering period. Estimated organization costs are assessed on a fixed dollar amount per Unit basis which, as a percentage of average net assets, will vary over time. (d) Each of the fees listed herein is assessed on a fixed dollar amount per Unit basis which, as a percentage of average net assets, will vary over time. (e) Other operating expenses do not include brokerage costs and other portfolio transaction fees. In certain circumstances, the Trust may incur additional expenses not set forth above.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement of net assets is free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the statement of net assets, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the statement of net assets. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Trust's Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the statement of net assets. Our procedures included confirmation with the broker and confirmation of the irrevocable letter of credit held by The Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, and deposited in the Trust for the purchase of securities, as shown in the statement of net assets, as of the opening of business on January 23, 2026, by correspondence with the Trustee. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Chicago, Illinois January 23, 2026 We have served as the auditor of one or more investment companies sponsored by First Trust Portfolios L.P. since 2001.

The Sponsor is responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which require the Sponsor to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported herein. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Trust intends to comply in its initial fiscal year and thereafter with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and as such, will not be subject to federal income taxes on otherwise taxable income (including net realized capital gains) distributed to Unit holders. (1) The Trust invests in a portfolio of purchased and written FLEX Options. Aggregate cost of the purchased FLEX Options listed under ""Schedule of Investments"" and the liability for the written FLEX Options are based on their aggregate underlying value. The Securities were deposited at prices equal to their market value as determined by the Sponsor. The Trust has a Mandatory Termination Date of April 23, 2027. (2) An irrevocable letter of credit issued by The Bank of New York Mellon, of which approximately $300,000 has been allocated to the Trust, has been deposited with the Trustee as collateral, covering the monies necessary for the purchase of the Securities according to their purchase contracts $144,696 and cash $1,610. Cash is included in the Trust to cover the cost of the Trust's organization costs, the creation and development fee and the Trust's annual operating expenses. (3) The Trust will enter into option contracts which provide the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to buy a security at a predetermined exercise price on the option's expiration date and the Trust will also enter into option contracts which provide the option purchaser with the right, but not the obligation, to sell a security to the Trust at a predetermined price on the option's expiration date. The option purchaser pays a premium to the option writer for the right to exercise the option. The option writer is obligated to sell or buy the security underlying the contract at a set price, if the option purchaser chooses to exercise the option. As a writer of an option contract, the Trust is not subject to credit risk but is subject to market risk, since the Trust is obligated to make payments under the terms of the option contract if exercised. (4) A portion of the Public Offering Price consists of an amount sufficient to reimburse the Sponsor for all or a portion of the costs of establishing the Trust. These costs have been estimated at $.0380 per Unit. A payment will be made at the end of the initial offering period to an account maintained by the Trustee from which the obligation of the investors to the Sponsor will be satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs of the Trust are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs added to the Public Offering Price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and deducted from the assets of the Trust. (5) The creation and development fee ($.050 per Unit) is payable by the Trust on behalf of Unit holders out of assets of the Trust at the end of the initial offering period. If Units are redeemed prior to the close of the initial offering period, the fee will not be deducted from the proceeds. (6) Net asset value per Unit, as rounded to the nearest penny, is calculated by dividing the Trust's net assets by the number of Units outstanding. This figure includes organization costs and the creation and development fee, which will only be assessed to Units outstanding at the end of the initial offering period. (7) The aggregate cost to investors in the Trust, excluding the amount held in cash deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs and creation and development fee, includes a maximum sales charge computed at the rate of 1.85% of the Public Offering Price per Unit (equivalent to 1.88% of the net amount invested), assuming no reduction of sales charge as set forth under ""Public Offering.""

The Sponsor entered into purchase contracts for the Securities on January 23, 2026. Such purchase contracts are expected to settle within one business day. (2) Each FLEX Option contract entitles the holder thereof (i.e., the purchaser) to purchase (for the call options) or sell (for the put options) 100 shares of the SPDR(R) S&P 500(R) ETF Trust on the FLEX Option Expiration Date of April 23, 2027 at the FLEX Option's strike price multiplied by 100. The notional value of the FLEX Options as of the Initial Date of Deposit are as follows: Purchased Options: Call Options on SPY $137,582 Put Options on SPY $137,582 Written Options: Put Options on SPY $137,582 Call Options on SPY $137,582 (3) The cost or proceeds of the Securities to the Trust represents the aggregate underlying value with respect to the Securities acquired, generally determined based on the last quoted sale price where readily available and appropriate. On the Initial Date of Deposit, the value of the Securities will be based on the specific trade prices in which the Securities representing the Trust are executed. If no trades occur for a specific trade date or the Sponsor determines that market quotations are unavailable or inappropriate (e.g., due to infrequent transactions or thin trading), the Sponsor will determine the underlying value of the Securities based on their good faith determination of the fair value of the Securities at their discretion. To determine the fair value of the Securities, where available, the Sponsor will start with values generated using model prices provided by an independent third party, which uses a proprietary algorithm using standard option valuation variables and calculations. Where such values are not available through typical third party sources, the Sponsor will generate their own model- based valuations of the Securities, including using the Black-Scholes model for option valuation, and use current market quotations for comparable listed options that are more actively traded. The valuation of the Securities has been determined by the Sponsor. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 820 (""ASC 820""), ""Fair Value Measurement,"" fair value is defined as the price that the Trust would either receive upon selling an investment or pay to transfer an option's liability to Page 7 an independent buyer in a timely transaction in the principal or most advantageous market of the investment. ASC 820 established a three-tier hierarchy to maximize the use of the observable market data and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of the fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including the technique or pricing model used to measure fair value and the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs are inputs that may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the three broad levels: Level 1 which represents quoted prices in active markets for identical investments; Level 2 which represents fair value based on other significant observable inputs (including, quoted prices for similar investments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are non-active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the investment (for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks, and default rates) or inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means), and Level 3 which represents fair value based on significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own assumptions in determining the fair value of investments). The Trust's investments in purchased options of $144,696 and written options of $(7,512) are classified as Level 2, whose valuations on the date of deposit were determined by the Sponsor using model prices provided by third-party pricing services. The inputs used by these third party pricing services were based upon significant observable inputs that included, but were not limited to, the items noted above. The cost of the Securities to the Sponsor and the Sponsor's loss (which is the difference between the cost of the Securities to the Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to the Trust) are $137,224 and $40, respectively. Page 8 The FT Series The FT Series Defined. We, First Trust Portfolios L.P. (the ""Sponsor""), have created hundreds of similar yet separate series of a unit investment trust which we have named the FT Series. The series to which this prospectus relates, FT 12696, consists of a single portfolio known as Vest Large Cap Deep Buffered 20 Portfolio, Series 99. The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York by a Trust Agreement (the ""Indenture"") dated the Initial Date of Deposit. This agreement, entered into among First Trust Portfolios L.P., as Sponsor, The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee and First Trust Advisors L.P. as Portfolio Supervisor, governs the operation of the Trust. YOU MAY GET MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS CONCERNING THE NATURE, STRUCTURE AND RISKS OF THIS PRODUCT IN AN ""INFORMATION SUPPLEMENT"" BY CALLING THE SPONSOR AT 800- 621-1675, DEPT. CODE 2. How We Created the Trust. On the Initial Date of Deposit, we deposited a portfolio of FLEX Options and cash with the Trustee and, in turn, the Trustee delivered documents to us representing our ownership of the Trust in the form of units (""Units""). After the Initial Date of Deposit, we may deposit additional Securities in the Trust, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with instructions to buy more Securities, to create new Units for sale. If we create additional Units, we will attempt, to the extent practicable, to maintain the percentage relationship established among the Securities on the Initial Date of Deposit (as set forth under ""Schedule of Investments""), adjusted to reflect the sale, redemption or liquidation of any of the Securities or any stock split or a merger or other similar event affecting the issuer of the Securities. Since the prices of the Securities will fluctuate daily, the ratio of Securities in the Trust, on a market value basis, will also change daily. The portion of Securities represented by each Unit will not change as a result of the deposit of additional Securities or cash in the Trust. If we deposit cash, you and new investors may experience a dilution of your investment. This is because prices of Securities will fluctuate between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the Securities, and because the Trust pays the associated brokerage fees. To reduce this dilution, the Trust will try to buy the Securities as close to the Evaluation Time and as close to the evaluation price as possible. You may also experience a dilution of your investment when the Trust sells Securities to meet redemption requests as Securities are typically sold after the redemption request is received. Because the Trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the sale of Securities to meet redemption and exchange requests, frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result in higher brokerage expenses. TO THE EXTENT THERE IS A DILUTION TO YOUR INVESTMENT IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE THE HYPOTHETICAL RETURNS SET FORTH IN THIS PROSPECTUS. An affiliate of the Trustee may receive these brokerage fees or the Trustee may retain and pay us (or our affiliate) to act as agent for the Trust to buy Securities. If we or an affiliate of ours act as agent to the Trust, we will be subject to the restrictions under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ""1940 Act""). When acting in an agency capacity, we may select various broker/dealers to execute securities transactions on behalf of the Trust, which may include broker/dealers who sell Units of the Trust. We do not consider sales of Units of the Trust or any other products sponsored by First Trust as a factor in selecting such broker/dealers. We cannot guarantee that the Trust will keep its present size and composition for any length of time. Securities may be periodically sold under certain circumstances to satisfy Trust obligations, to meet redemption requests and, as described in ""Removing Securities from the Trust,"" to maintain the sound investment character of the Trust, and the proceeds received by the Trust will be used to meet Trust obligations or distributed to Unit holders. However, Securities will not be sold to take advantage of market fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation or depreciation, or if they no longer meet the criteria by which they were selected. You will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the Securities in the Trust. As the holder of the Securities, the Trustee will vote the Securities and, except as described in ""Removing Securities from the Trust,"" will endeavor to vote the Securities such that the Securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the Securities held by owners other than such Trust. Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for a failure in any of the Securities. However, if a contract for the purchase of any of the Securities initially deposited in the Trust fails, unless we can purchase substitute Securities (""Replacement Securities"") we will refund to you that portion of the purchase price and transactional sales charge resulting from the failed contract. Any Replacement Security the Trust acquires will be identical to those from the failed contract. Page 9 Portfolio Objective. The Trust seeks to provide returns that match the price return of the Underlying ETF up to a predetermined upside cap of 12.78% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs) while providing a buffer against the first 20% of Underlying ETF losses (before applicable sales charges and organization costs) during the period from January 23, 2026 to April 23, 2027. Under normal market conditions, the Trust will invest at least 80% of its net assets in investments that provide exposure to large capitalization companies. The Trust is concentrated (i.e., invests 25% or more of Trust assets) in investments that provide exposure to the information technology sector. The Portfolio. The Trust seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio consisting of purchased and written FLEX Options and cash to pay for the annual operating expenses, creation and development fee and organization costs of the Trust. Because a portion of your investment is held in cash to pay for these expenses, and the cap and buffer amounts are determined independent of the cash component, such expenses will not further reduce the cap and buffer amounts disclosed in this prospectus. The FLEX Options are listed on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (the ""CBOE"") and are guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation (the ""OCC""). The FLEX Options reference shares of the Underlying ETF which had a share price on the NYSE of $687.91 (the ""Initial Underlying ETF Level"") at the time the FLEX Options were executed and entitle or obligate the holder to purchase or sell shares of the Underlying ETF at each FLEX Option's strike price on April 23, 2027 (the ""FLEX Option Expiration Date""). The FLEX Options are all European style options, which means that they are exercisable at the strike price only on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. The FLEX Options are intended to be liquidated on or prior to the FLEX Option Expiration Date, rather than be exercised, in order to avoid having the Trust receive shares of the Underlying ETF or be obligated to deliver shares of the Underlying ETF. The FLEX Options are intended to generate returns based on the price performance of the Underlying ETF. Please note that the Trust's performance will not reflect the payment of dividends by the Underlying ETF. The Underlying ETF is an exchange-traded fund (""ETF"") that seeks to track performance of the S&P 500(R) Index (the ""Underlying Index""). The Underlying Index is composed of selected stocks from five hundred (500) issuers, all of which are listed on national stock exchanges and spans a broad range of major industries. See ""The Underlying ETF and the Underlying Index"" on page 14. The Trust is designed for Unit holders who intend to purchase Units at the Trust's inception, the only day Units are available for sale, and hold them until April 23, 2027, the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, and seeks a percentage total return per Unit that increases by any percentage increase in the price of the Underlying ETF relative to the Initial Underlying ETF Level up to a maximum total return of 12.78% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs), 10.28% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account) and 11.80% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account) (the ""Capped Return""), while also providing downside ""buffered"" protection of up to the first 20% of the decline in the Underlying ETF (before applicable sales charges and organization costs) (""Buffered Protection""). Returns after application of the buffer will be reduced by -2.21% for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account and -0.87% for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account. See ""Fee Table"" in this prospectus for information regarding these fees and expenses. The Capped Return and the Buffered Protection are based on the life of the Trust and are not an annualized rate of return. The percentage increase or decrease of the Underlying ETF described above is the percentage increase or decrease of the Underlying ETF from when the FLEX Option strike levels are set on the initial date of deposit to the close of the market on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. The Trust's ability to achieve its investment objective is dependent on Unit holders purchasing Units at a price equal to their initial net asset value ($10 per Unit) and holding them until the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the Initial Date of Deposit, which will be higher than $10 per Unit (the Trust's net asset value per Unit on the Initial Date of Deposit) because of the Trust's sales charges and organization costs, which will impact your potential returns. THE TRUST MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THE HYPOTHETICAL RETURNS SET FORTH IN THIS PROSPECTUS. THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE MAY BE IMPACTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REDEMPTION ACTIVITY, A DILUTION OF YOUR INVESTMENT, UNUSUAL ECONOMIC EVENTS, MARKET MOVEMENTS AND CHANGES IN THE LIQUIDITY OF THE FLEX OPTIONS. REDEMPTION ACTIVITY COULD CAUSE THE TRUST TO Page 10 RECOGNIZE INCOME THAT THE TRUST IS REQUIRED TO DISTRIBUTE TO MAINTAIN THE TRUST'S RIC STATUS AND AVOID THE EXCISE TAX. SELLING SECURITIES TO MAKE THESE DISTRIBUTIONS MAY IMPACT THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE. THE TRUST'S PORTFOLIO IS NOT MANAGED. IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT THE FLEX OPTIONS CANNOT MAINTAIN THEIR PROPER RATIOS, THERE MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE TRUST'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OR FOLLOW ITS PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY. Illustrative Market Scenarios. The Trust seeks to provide returns based on the price performance of the Underlying ETF for Units purchased on the Trust's Initial Date of Deposit at their initial net asset value of $10 per Unit and held until the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date as follows: - THE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF INCREASES ABOVE A CAPPED RETURN OF 12.78%. If, at the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the price of the Underlying ETF increased by greater than or equal to 12.78% compared to the price of the Underlying ETF at the Trust's inception, the Trust seeks to provide Unit holders with a maximum total return of 12.78% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs), 10.28% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account) and 11.80% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account). If the price of the Underlying ETF increases above the Capped Return, Unit holders will not participate in those gains beyond the Capped Return. - THE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF INCREASES BETWEEN 0% AND A CAPPED RETURN OF 12.78%. If, at the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the price of the Underlying ETF increased between 0% and 12.78% compared to the price of the Underlying ETF at the Trust's inception, the Trust seeks to provide Unit holders with a total return that increases by the approximate percentage increase of the price of the Underlying ETF, up to a maximum return of 12.78% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs), 10.28% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account) and 11.80% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account). - THE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF DECREASES BETWEEN 0% AND 20%. If, at the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the price of the Underlying ETF decreased between 0% and 20% compared to the price of the Underlying ETF at the Trust's inception, the Trust seeks to provide Unit holders with a ""buffered"" total return of approximately 0.00% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs), -2.21% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account) and -0.87% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account). - THE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF DECREASES BY GREATER THAN 20%. If, at the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the price of the Underlying ETF decreased by greater than 20% compared to the price of the Underlying ETF at the Trust's inception, the Trust seeks to provide Unit holders with a loss that is 20% less (before applicable sales charges and organization costs) than the loss of the Underlying ETF, with a maximum loss of approximately -80.44% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a traditional brokerage account) and -80.17% (after sales charges and organization costs for Units purchased through a ""wrap fee"" account) (the ""Maximum Loss""). If the price of the Underlying ETF decreases by greater than 20%, Unit holders will only be protected against the first 20% of Underlying ETF losses. Page 11 Hypothetical Performance Return Chart The following chart illustrates the hypothetical returns that the Trust seeks to provide in certain illustrative scenarios. THIS CHART DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PAYMENT BY UNIT HOLDERS OF APPLICABLE SALES CHARGES AND ORGANIZATION COSTS, AS SUCH GAINS WILL BE DECREASED BY THE SALES CHARGES AND ORGANIZATION COSTS AND LOSSES WILL BE INCREASED BY THE SALES CHARGES AND ORGANIZATION COSTS. Please note that the chart assumes a capped return of approximately 12.78% (before applicable sales charges and organization costs) and a buffer against the first 20% of Underlying ETF losses (before applicable sales charges and organization costs).

Page 12 What is a FLEX Option? The Trust's initial portfolio includes several types of FLEX Options including purchased and written put and call options (as further described below). The FLEX Options are all European style options, which means that they are exercisable at the strike price only on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. FLEX Options are customized option contracts available through national securities exchanges that are guaranteed for settlement by the OCC, a market clearinghouse. The FLEX Options are listed on the CBOE. FLEX Options provide investors with the ability to customize terms of an option, including exercise prices, exercise styles (European style versus American style options which are exercisable any time prior to the expiration date) and expiration dates, while achieving price discovery in competitive, transparent auctions markets and avoiding the counterparty exposure of the over-the-counter option positions. Each FLEX Option contract entitles the holder thereof (i.e., the purchaser of the FLEX Option) the option to purchase (for the call options) or sell (for the put options) 100 shares of the Underlying ETF as of the close of the market on the FLEX Option Expiration Date at the strike price multiplied by 100. The Trust is designed so that any amount owed by the Trust on the written FLEX Options will be covered by payouts at expiration from the purchased FLEX Options. As a result, the FLEX Options will be fully covered and no additional collateral will be necessary during the life of the Trust. The Trust receives premiums in exchange for the written FLEX Options and pays premiums in exchange for the purchased FLEX Options. The OCC and securities exchange that the FLEX Options are listed on do not charge ongoing fees to writers or purchasers of the FLEX Options during their life for continuing to hold the option contracts. The OCC guarantees performance by each of the counterparties to FLEX Options, becoming the ""buyer for every seller and the seller for every buyer,"" protecting clearing members and options traders from counterparty risk. Subject to determination by the Securities Committee of the OCC, adjustments may be made to the FLEX Options for certain events (collectively, ""Corporate Actions"") specified in the OCC's by-laws and rules: certain stock dividends or distributions, stock splits, reverse stock splits, rights offerings, distributions, reorganizations, recapitalizations, or reclassifications with respect to an underlying security, or a merger, consolidation, dissolution or liquidation of the issuer of the underlying security. According to the OCC's by-laws, the nature and extent of any such adjustment is to be determined by the OCC's Securities Committee, in light of the circumstances known to it at the time such determination is made, based on its judgment as to what is appropriate for the protection of investors and the public interest, taking into account such factors as fairness to holders and writers (or purchasers and sellers) of the affected options, the maintenance of a fair and orderly market in the affected options, consistency of interpretation and practice, efficiency of exercise settlement procedures, and the coordination with other clearing agencies of the clearance and settlement of transactions in the underlying interest. The information set forth above relating to the FLEX Options and the OCC has been obtained from the OCC. The description and terms of the FLEX Options to be entered into with the OCC are set forth in the by-laws and rules of the OCC, available at www.optionsclearing.com, which is not considered part of this prospectus nor is it incorporated by reference herein. The Trust invests in in-the-money purchased call options, out-of-the-money written call options, at-the-money purchased put options and out-of-the-money written put options. The following discussion describes each type of security. In-The-Money Purchased Call Options (""ITM Purchased Call Options""). The ITM Purchased Call Options are call options purchased by the Trust, each with a strike price significantly lower than the Initial Underlying ETF Level. If the price of the Underlying ETF is less than or equal to the strike price of the ITM Purchased Call Options on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the ITM Purchased Call Options will expire without net proceeds being payable to the Trust (i.e., the ITM Purchased Call Options will expire worthless). If the price of the Underlying ETF is greater than the strike price on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, then the ITM Purchased Call Options are intended to provide a return to the Trust based on the difference between the strike price of the ITM Purchased Call Options and the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date equal to a per Unit dollar amount of proceeds of $10.000 multiplied by ((the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date divided by the Initial Underlying ETF Level) minus 0.00%) on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. The ITM Purchased Call Options are intended to provide approximately one-to-one exposure to the Underlying ETF. Out-Of-The-Money Written Call Options (""OTM Written Call Options""). The OTM Written Call Options are call options written by the Trust, each with a strike price greater than the Initial Underlying ETF Level. If the price of the Underlying ETF is less than or equal to the strike price of the OTM Written Page 13 Call Options on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the OTM Written Call Options will expire without net proceeds being payable by the Trust (i.e., the OTM Written Call Options will expire worthless). If the price of the Underlying ETF is greater than the strike price on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, then the OTM Written Call Options are intended to provide for the Trust to deliver proceeds to the purchasers of the OTM Written Call Options based on the increase of the price of the Underlying ETF over the strike price of the OTM Written Call Options equal to a per Unit dollar amount of proceeds of $10.000 multiplied by ((the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date divided by the Initial Underlying ETF Level) minus 112.78%) on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. The OTM Written Call Options are intended to provide premiums to the Trust that will offset the cost of the purchased FLEX Options and are also intended to limit the increase from the FLEX Options to 12.78%. At-The-Money Purchased Put Options (""ATM Purchased Put Options""). The ATM Purchased Put Options are put options purchased by the Trust, each with a strike price equal to the Initial Underlying ETF Level. If the price of the Underlying ETF is greater than or equal to the strike price of the ATM Purchased Put Options on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the ATM Purchased Put Options will expire without net proceeds being payable to the Trust (i.e., the ATM Purchased Put Options will expire worthless). If the price of the Underlying ETF is less than the strike price on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, then the ATM Purchased Put Options are intended to provide a return to the Trust based on the decrease between the Initial Underlying ETF Level and the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date equal to a per Unit dollar amount of proceeds of $10.000 multiplied by (100.00% minus (the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date divided by the Initial Underlying ETF Level)) on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. Out-Of-The-Money Written Put Options (""OTM Written Put Options""). The OTM Written Put Options are put options written by the Trust, each with a strike price less than the Initial Underlying ETF Level. If the price of the Underlying ETF is greater than or equal to the strike price of the OTM Written Put Options on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, the OTM Written Put Options will expire without net proceeds being payable by the Trust (i.e., the OTM Written Put Options will expire worthless). If the price of the Underlying ETF is less than the strike price on the FLEX Option Expiration Date, then the OTM Written Put Options are intended to provide for the Trust to deliver proceeds to the purchasers of the OTM Written Put Options based on the decrease between the Initial Underlying ETF Level and the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date equal to a per Unit dollar amount of proceeds of $10.000 multiplied by (80.00% minus (the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date divided by the Initial Underlying ETF Level)) on the FLEX Option Expiration Date. The ATM Purchased Put Options along with the OTM Written Put Options are intended to offset a decrease between the Initial Underlying ETF Level and the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date up to 20%. The Underlying ETF and the Underlying Index. The SPDR(R) S&P 500(R) ETF Trust (the ""Underlying ETF"") is an exchange-traded unit investment trust that uses a full replication strategy, meaning it invests entirely in the securities which comprise the S&P 500(R) Index (the ""Underlying Index""). PDR Services, LLC (""PDR"") serves as the Underlying ETF's sponsor. The investment objective of the Underlying ETF is to seek to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the Underlying Index. See below for a description of the Underlying ETF's principal investment strategies and risks. You can find the Underlying ETF's prospectus and other information about the Underlying ETF, including the statement of additional information and most recent reports to shareholders, online at https://us.spdrs.com/en/etf/spdr-sp-500-etf-SPY. The summary information below regarding the Underlying ETF comes from its filings with the SEC (File No. 33-46080). You are urged to refer to the SEC filings made by the Underlying ETF and to other publicly available information (e.g., the Underlying ETF's annual reports) to obtain an understanding of the Underlying ETF's business and financial prospects. The following description of the Underlying ETF's principal investment strategies was taken directly from the Underlying ETF's prospectus, dated January 27, 2025 (defined terms have been modified). ""SPY seeks to achieve its investment objective by holding a portfolio of the common stocks that are included in the Index (the ""Portfolio""), with the weight of each stock in SPY's Portfolio substantially corresponding to the weight of such stock in the Index. In SPY's prospectus, the term ""Portfolio Securities"" refers to the common stocks that are actually held by SPY and make up SPY's Portfolio, while the Page 14 term ""Index Securities"" refers to the common stocks that are included in the Index, as determined by the index provider, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (""S&P""). At any time, SPY's Portfolio will consist of as many of the Index Securities as is practicable. To maintain the correspondence between the composition and weightings of Portfolio Securities and Index Securities, State Street Global Advisors Trust Company (the ""Trustee"") or its parent company, State Street Bank and Trust Company (""SSBT"") adjusts SPY's Portfolio from time to time to conform to periodic changes made by S&P to the identity and/or relative weightings of Index Securities in the Index. SPY's Trustee or SSBT aggregates certain of these adjustments and makes changes to SPY's Portfolio at least monthly, or more frequently in the case of significant changes to the Index. SPY may pay transaction costs, such as brokerage commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its Portfolio). Such transaction costs may be higher if there are significant rebalancings of Index Securities in the Index, which may also result in higher taxes when SPY's units are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in SPY's estimated annual Trust ordinary operating expenses, affect SPY's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, SPY's portfolio turnover rate was 3% of the average value of its portfolio. SPY's portfolio turnover rate does not include securities received or delivered from processing creations or redemptions of SPY's units. Portfolio turnover will be a function of changes to the Index as well as requirements of SPY's trust agreement.... Although SPY may fail to own certain Index Securities at any particular time, SPY generally will be substantially invested in Index Securities, which should result in a close correspondence between the performance of the Index and the performance of SPY....SPY does not hold or trade futures or swaps and is not a commodity pool.... The Index includes five hundred (500) selected companies, all of which are listed on national stock exchanges and spans a broad range of major industries....Since 1968, the Index has been a component of the U.S. Commerce Department's list of Leading Indicators that track key sectors of the U.S. economy. Current information regarding the market value of the Index is available from market information services. The Index is determined, comprised and calculated without regard to SPY."" As of January 21, 2026, the Underlying ETF had significant investments in information technology companies.

Of course, as with any similar investment, there can be no guarantee that the objectives of the Trust will be achieved. See ""Risk Factors"" for a discussion of the risks of investing in the Trust. Hypothetical Examples The examples that follow illustrate various scenarios with respect to the FLEX Options held by the Trust. The assumptions made in connection with these examples may not reflect actual events. You should not take any example as an indication or assurance of the expected performance of the Underlying ETF, the FLEX Options or the Trust Units. These examples do not attempt to present any projection of actual Trust performance. These examples are merely intended to illustrate the operation of the FLEX Options and the return or loss in certain situations. The hypothetical returns shown below do not reflect the deduction of the Trust's sales charges or organization costs. Please note that the examples assume a capped return of approximately 12.78% (before the applicable sales charges and Page 15 organization costs) and a buffer against the first 20% of Underlying ETF losses (before applicable sales charges and organization costs). EXAMPLE 1 - FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE CLOSING PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF INCREASES BY 40% The following provides an example of how the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would perform should the FLEX Option Expiration Date closing price of the Underlying ETF increase by 40% over the Initial Underlying ETF Level. Under this scenario, a $1,000.00 investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would provide a hypothetical return of approximately $1,127.80 on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, consisting of: - receiving value of approximately $1,399.98 on the ITM Purchased Call Options, - no value being realized with respect to the OTM Written Put Options or the ATM Purchased Put Options, as each would expire worthless, - losing value of approximately $272.21 on the OTM Written Call Options, and - receiving cash value of $0.03. In this example, participation in the appreciation of the Underlying ETF is capped by the Capped Return feature. Therefore, an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust does not benefit from the full appreciation of the Underlying ETF during the term of the Trust. Because of the Capped Return feature, return will be less than a direct investment in the Underlying ETF, which would not be subject to such a Capped Return. In this example, return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust is not affected by the Buffered Protection feature or the Maximum Loss feature. In this example, the hypothetical total return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust used to pay the Trust's annual operating expenses, would be approximately 12.78%. The total return on an investment in the Trust under this scenario would be less than 12.78% because the price of Units will include the applicable sales charges and organization costs. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units, which will be higher than $10 per Unit, which will reduce your potential returns. The hypothetical return above does not reflect the deduction of any sales charges or organization costs. EXAMPLE 2 - FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE CLOSING PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF INCREASES BY 5% The following provides an example of how the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would perform should the expiration date closing price represent a 5% increase over the Initial Underlying ETF Level. Under this scenario, a $1,000.00 investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would provide a hypothetical return of approximately $1,050.01 on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, consisting of: - receiving value of approximately $1,049.98 on the ITM Purchased Call Options, - no value being realized with respect to the OTM Written Put Options, the ATM Purchased Put Options or OTM Written Call Options, as each would expire worthless, and - receiving cash value of $0.03. In this example, upside exposure to the Underlying ETF is similar to the price return (not including returns from dividends) available from a direct investment in the Underlying ETF because the performance of the Underlying ETF did not exceed the Capped Return. In this example, return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust is not affected by the Buffered Protection feature, the Maximum Loss feature or the Capped Return feature. In this example, the hypothetical total return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust used to pay the Trust's annual operating expenses, would be approximately 5.00%. The total return on an investment in the Trust under this scenario would be less than 5.00% because the price of Units will include the applicable sales charges and organization costs. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units, which will be higher than $10 per Unit, which will reduce your potential returns. The hypothetical return above does not reflect the deduction of any sales charges or organization costs. EXAMPLE 3 - FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE CLOSING PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF DECREASES BY 5% The following provides an example of how the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would perform should the expiration date closing price represent a 5% decrease from the Initial Underlying ETF Level. Under this scenario, a $1,000.00 investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would Page 16 provide a hypothetical return of approximately $1,000.01 on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, consisting of: - receiving value of approximately $949.98 on the ITM Purchased Call Options, - receiving value of approximately $50.00 on the ATM Purchased Put Options, - no value being realized with respect to the OTM Written Put Options or OTM Written Call Options, as each would expire worthless, and - receiving cash value of $0.03. In this example there are benefits from the Buffered Protection feature provided where the price of the Underlying ETF on the FLEX Option Expiration Date represents a decrease from the Initial Underlying ETF Level, but by less than 20%. Because of the Buffered Protection feature, the Unit holder's return would be better than the price return (not including returns from dividends) from a direct investment in the Underlying ETF. In this example, return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust is not affected by the Maximum Loss feature or Capped Return feature. In this example, the hypothetical total return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust used to pay the Trust's annual operating expenses, would be approximately 0.00%. The total return on an investment in the Trust under this scenario would be less than 0.00% because the price of Units will include the applicable sales charges and organization costs. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units, which will be higher than $10 per Unit, which will reduce your potential returns. The hypothetical return above does not reflect the deduction of any sales charges or organization costs. EXAMPLE 4 - FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE CLOSING PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF DECREASES BY 50% The following provides an example of how the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would perform should the expiration date closing price represent a 50% decrease from the Initial Underlying ETF Level. Under this scenario, a $1,000.00 investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would provide a hypothetical return of approximately $700.01 on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, consisting of: - receiving value of approximately $499.98 on the ITM Purchased Call Options, - receiving value of approximately $500.00 on the ATM Purchased Put Options, - no value being realized with respect to the OTM Written Call Options, as they would expire worthless, - losing value of approximately $300.00 on the OTM Written Put Options, and - receiving cash value of $0.03. In this example, there is a loss less than the loss that would have resulted from a direct investment in the Underlying ETF (not including returns from dividends). In this example, return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust benefits from the Buffered Protection feature, and is not affected by the Maximum Loss feature or Capped Return feature. In this example, the hypothetical loss on a investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust used to pay the Trust's annual operating expenses, would be approximately -30.00%. The total return on an investment in the Trust under this scenario would be less than -30.00% because the price of Units will include the applicable sales charges and organization costs. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units, which will be higher than $10 per Unit, which will reduce your potential returns. The hypothetical return above does not reflect the deduction of any sales charges or organization costs. EXAMPLE 5 - FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE CLOSING PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF DECREASES BY 95% The following provides an example of how the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would perform should the expiration date closing price represent a 95% decrease from the Initial Underlying ETF Level. Under this scenario, a $1,000.00 investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust would provide a hypothetical return of approximately $250.01 on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date, consisting of: - receiving value of approximately $49.99 on the ITM Purchased Call Options, - receiving value of approximately $949.99 on the ATM Purchased Put Options, - no value being realized with respect to the OTM Written Call Options, as they would expire worthless, - losing value of approximately $750.00 on the OTM Written Put Options, and - receiving cash value of $0.03. In this example, there are benefits from the Buffered Protection feature and a loss less than the loss that would have resulted from a direct investment in the Underlying ETF (not including returns from dividends). In this example, return on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust is not affected by the Capped Return feature. Page 17 In this example, the hypothetical loss on an investment in the FLEX Options and cash held by the Trust used to pay the Trust's annual operating expenses, would be approximately -75.00%. The total return on an investment in the Trust under this scenario would be less than -75.00% because the price of Units will include the applicable sales charges and organization costs. The price at which you will be able to purchase Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the date you purchase your Units, which will be higher than $10 per Unit, which will reduce your potential returns. The hypothetical return above does not reflect the deduction of any sales charges or organization costs. THE RETURN ON UNITS REDEEMED PRIOR TO THE TERMINATION OF THE TRUST WILL LIKELY BE LESS THAN THE ORIGINAL PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE AND THE RETURN THAT A UNIT HOLDER COULD EXPECT IF UNITS WERE HELD UNTIL THE TRUST'S TERMINATION. IN ADDITION, DURING THE LIFE OF THE TRUST, THE UNIT VALUE WILL NOT MOVE PROPORTIONALLY WITH CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF. ANY REDEMPTION OF UNITS PRIOR TO THE TRUST'S TERMINATION COULD RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS.

Page 18 THESE EXAMPLES DO NOT SHOW THE PAST PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING ETF OR ANY INVESTMENT. THESE EXAMPLES ARE FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS OF THE UNDERLYING ETF, THE FLEX OPTIONS OR THE TRUST'S UNITS. YOU MAY REALIZE A RETURN THAT IS LOWER THAN THE INTENDED RETURNS DESCRIBED ABOVE AS A RESULT OF UNITS BEING REDEEMED PRIOR TO THE TRUST'S MANDATORY TERMINATION DATE, PURCHASING UNITS AT A PRICE OTHER THAN THE INITIAL NET ASSET VALUE OF THE UNITS ON THE INITIAL DATE OF DEPOSIT, IN THE EVENT THAT THE FLEX OPTIONS ARE OTHERWISE LIQUIDATED BY THE TRUST PRIOR TO EXPIRATION, IF THERE IS A LACK OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE FLEX OPTIONS DURING THE LIFE OF THE TRUST OR ON THE FLEX OPTION EXPIRATION DATE, IF THE TRUST IS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN THE PROPORTIONAL RELATIONSHIP OF THE FLEX OPTIONS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF FLEX OPTION CONTRACTS IN THE TRUST'S PORTFOLIO, IF A CORPORATE ACTION (DEFINED ABOVE) OCCURS WITH RESPECT TO THE UNDERLYING ETF, OR AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN POTENTIAL TAX-RELATED EXPENSES AND OTHER EXPENSES OF THE TRUST ABOVE ESTIMATED LEVELS. Risk Factors Price Volatility Risk. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee that the performance of the Trust will be positive over any period of time, or that you won't lose money. The Trust invests in FLEX Options. The value of the Trust's Units will fluctuate with changes in the value of the FLEX Options. The value of your Units may fall over time. Amounts available to distribute to Unit holders on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date will depend primarily on the performance of the FLEX Options and are not guaranteed. The Trust seeks to provide returns related to the price performance of the Underlying ETF only, which does not include returns from distributions paid by the Underlying ETF. The Units, on the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date and at any other point in time, may be worth less than your original investment. In addition, during the life of the Trust, the Unit value will not move proportionally with changes in the value of the Underlying ETF. The Trust's investment strategy has not been designed to achieve its objective if Units are bought after the Trust's Initial Date of Deposit or redeemed prior to the Trust's Mandatory Termination Date. Because the Trust is not managed, the Trustee will not sell Securities in response to or in anticipation of market fluctuations, as is common in managed investments. Units of the Trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Underlying ETF Market Risk. The FLEX Options represent indirect positions in the Underlying ETF and are subject to risks associated with changes in value as the price of the Underlying ETF rises or falls. The investment in the FLEX Options includes the risk that their value may be affected by market risk related to the Underlying ETF, the Underlying Index and the value of the securities in the Underlying Index held by the Underlying ETF. Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities will fluctuate. Market value fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of an issuer, ratings on a bond, or political or economic events affecting the issuer. While the FLEX Options are individually related to the Underlying ETF, the return on the FLEX Options depends on the price of the Underlying ETF at the close of the NYSE on the FLEX Option Expiration Date and will be substantially determined by market conditions and the Underlying ETF and the value of the securities comprising the Underlying ETF as of such time. Common Stocks Risk. The Underlying ETF is an ETF that seeks to provide investment results that, before expenses, correspond generally to the price and yield performance of the S&P 500(R) Index. The value of the Underlying ETF will fluctuate over time based on changes in the value of the Underlying Index and securities represented by the Underlying ETF, which are subject to risks associated with investments in common stocks. Common stocks are subject to the risk that their prices will fall. Common stock prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors' perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market, such as market volatility, or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur. Common stock prices may also be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates, as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase, negatively impacting issuers. Common stocks represent a proportional share of ownership in a company. Shareholders of common stocks have rights to receive payments that are generally subordinate to those of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks of, such issuers. Common stocks are structurally subordinated to preferred stocks, bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and represent a residual claim on the issuer's assets that have no value unless such assets are sufficient to cover all other claims. Page 19 Concentration Risk. When 25% or more of a trust's portfolio is invested in securities that provide exposure to companies within a single sector, the trust is considered to be concentrated in that particular sector. A portfolio concentrated in one or more sectors may present more risks than a portfolio broadly diversified over several sectors. The Trust is concentrated in investments that provide exposure to the information technology sector. Information Technology. A significant percentage of the stocks held by the Underlying ETF are issued by information technology companies. Technology companies are generally subject to the risks of rapidly changing technologies; short product life cycles; fierce competition; aggressive pricing; frequent introduction of new or enhanced products; the loss of patent, copyright and trademark protections; cyclical market patterns; evolving industry standards; and frequent new product introductions. Technology companies may be smaller and less experienced companies, with limited product lines, markets or financial resources. Technology company stocks have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated to their operating performance. Also, the stocks of many Internet companies have exceptionally high price to earnings ratios with little or no earnings histories. Equity Investing Risk. Because the Trust holds FLEX Options that reference the Underlying ETF, the Trust has exposure to an investment in the Underlying ETF, which involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund of equity securities, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. An investment in the Underlying ETF is subject to the risks of any investment in a broadly based portfolio of common stocks, including the risk that the general level of stock prices may decline, thereby adversely affecting the value of such investment. The value of securities may fluctuate in accordance with changes in the financial condition of the issuers of the securities, the value of common stocks generally and other factors. The identity and weighting of the securities change from time to time. The financial condition of issuers of the securities may become impaired or the general condition of the stock market may deteriorate, either of which may cause a decrease in the value of the portfolio and thus in the value of units. Since the Underlying ETF is not actively managed, the adverse financial condition of an issuer will not result in its elimination from the portfolio unless such issuer is removed from the Index. Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market confidence in and perceptions of their issuers change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies, inflation and interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, and global or regional political, economic and banking crises. Holders of common stocks of any given issuer incur more risk than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations of the issuer because the rights of common stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally are subordinate to the rights of creditors of, or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by, such issuer. Further, unlike debt securities that typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity, or preferred stocks that typically have a liquidation preference and may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity. Common stock values are subject to market fluctuations as long as the common stock remains outstanding. The value of the portfolio will fluctuate over the entire life of the Trust. Large Capitalization Companies Risk. The securities held by the Underlying ETF are issued by large capitalization companies. The return on investment in stocks of large capitalization companies may be less than the return on investment in stocks of small and/or mid capitalization companies. Large capitalization companies may also grow at a slower rate than the overall market. Capped Upside Risk. The Trust's strategy seeks to provide returns that match those of the Underlying ETF for Units purchased on the Trust's Initial Date of Deposit and held for the entire Outcome Period, subject to a pre-determined upside cap. If an investor does not hold its Units for the entire Outcome Period, the returns realized by that investor may not match those that the Trust seeks to achieve. If the Underlying ETF experiences gains during the Outcome Period, the Trust will not participate in those gains beyond the cap. If the anticipated return approaches the cap during the life of the Trust, some investors may choose to redeem early. Such behavior may impose increased costs on the Trust, reducing the return to the remaining Unit holders. Buffered Loss Risk. There can be no guarantee that the Trust will be successful in its strategy to buffer against Underlying ETF losses if the Underlying ETF decreases over the Outcome Period by 20% or less. A Unit holder may lose their entire investment. The Trust's strategy seeks to deliver returns that match the price return of the Underlying ETF (up to the cap), Page 20 while covering the first 20% of downside losses, if Units are bought on the day on which the Trust enters into the FLEX Options and held until those FLEX Options expire at the end of the Outcome Period. In the event an investor sells or redeems Units prior to the expiration of the FLEX Options, the buffer that the Trust seeks to provide may not be available. Dilution Risk. If we deposit cash, you and new investors may experience a dilution of your investment. This is because prices of Securities will fluctuate between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the Securities, and because the Trust pays the associated brokerage fees. To reduce this dilution, the Trust will try to buy the Securities as close to the Evaluation Time and as close to the evaluation price as possible. You may also experience a dilution of your investment when the Trust sells Securities to meet redemption requests. Because the Trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the sale of Securities to meet redemption and exchange requests, frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result in higher brokerage expenses. To the extent there is a dilution to your investment it is highly likely that you will not receive the hypothetical returns set forth in this prospectus. Outcome Period Risk. The Trust's investment strategy is designed to deliver returns that match those of the Underlying ETF if Units are bought on the day on which the Trust enters into the FLEX Options (i.e., the first day of the Outcome Period) and held until those FLEX Options expire at the end of the Outcome Period, subject to the predetermined upside return cap. In the event an investor purchases Units after the first day of the Outcome Period or sells or redeems Units prior to the end of the Outcome Period, the value of that investor's investment in their Units may not be buffered against a decline in the value of the Underlying ETF and may not participate in a gain in the value of the Underlying ETF up to the cap for the investor's investment period. FLEX Options Risk. Trading FLEX Options involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities. The Trust may experience substantial downside from specific FLEX Option positions and certain FLEX Option positions may expire worthless. The FLEX Options are listed on an exchange; however, no one can guarantee that a liquid secondary trading market will exist for the FLEX Options. In the event that trading in the FLEX Options is limited or absent, the value of the Trust's FLEX Options may decrease. In a less liquid market for the FLEX Options, liquidating the FLEX Options may require the payment of a premium (for written FLEX Options) or acceptance of a discounted price (for purchased FLEX Options) and may take longer to complete. A less liquid trading market may adversely impact the value of the FLEX Options and Trust Units and result in the Trust being unable to achieve its investment objective. Less liquidity in the trading of the Trusts FLEX Options could have an impact on the prices paid or received by the Trust for the FLEX Options in connection with redemptions of the Trust's Units. Depending on the nature of this impact to pricing, the Trust may be forced to pay more for redemptions than the price at which it currently values the FLEX Options. Such overpayment could reduce the Trust's ability to maintain the cap and buffer. Additionally, in a less liquid market for the FLEX Options, the liquidation of a large number of options may more significantly impact the price. A less liquid trading market may adversely impact the value of the FLEX Options and the value of your investment. The trading in FLEX Options may be less deep and liquid than the market for certain other exchange-traded options, non-customized options or other securities. Transactions in FLEX Options are required to be centrally cleared. In a transaction involving FLEX Options, the Trust's counterparty is the OCC, rather than a bank or broker. Since the Trust is not a member of the OCC and only members (""clearing members"") can participate directly in the OCC, the Trust will hold its FLEX Options through accounts at clearing members. Although clearing members guarantee performance of their clients' obligations to the OCC, there is a risk that the assets of the Trust might not be fully protected in the event of a clearing member's bankruptcy, as the Trust would be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds segregated on behalf of the clearing member's customers for the relevant account class. Additionally, the OCC may be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the FLEX Options contracts. FLEX Options Valuation Risk. The FLEX Options held by the Trust will be exercisable at the strike price only on their expiration date. Prior to the expiration date, the value of the FLEX Options will be determined based upon market quotations or using other recognized pricing methods. The value of the FLEX Options does not increase or decrease at the same rate as the Underlying ETF (although they generally move in the same direction) or its underlying securities and FLEX Option prices may be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially during a short period of time. The value of the FLEX Options prior to the expiration date may vary because of factors other than the value of the Underlying ETF, such as interest rate changes, changing supply and demand, decreased liquidity of the FLEX Options, a change in the actual and perceived volatility of the stock market and the Underlying ETF and the Page 21 remaining time to expiration. An increase in the value of the written FLEX Options reduces the value of your Units. As the value of the written FLEX Options increases, the written FLEX Options have a more negative impact on the value of your Units. You should note that even if the value of the Underlying ETF does not change, if the value of a written FLEX Option increases (for example, based on increased volatility of the Underlying Index) your Units will lose value. After the premium is received on the written FLEX Options, the written FLEX Options will reduce the value of your Units. During periods of reduced market liquidity or in the absence of readily available market quotations for the holdings of the Trust, the ability of the Sponsor to value the FLEX Options based on their good faith determination of the fair value becomes more difficult and the judgment of the Sponsor may play a greater role in the valuation of the Trust's holdings due to reduced availability of reliable objective pricing data. Consequently, while such determinations may be made in good faith, it may nevertheless be more difficult for the Trust to accurately assign a daily value and could result in greater fluctuation in their valuations from one day to the next than if market quotations were used. Under those circumstances, the value of the FLEX Options will require more reliance on the Sponsor's judgment than that required for securities for which there is an active trading market. This creates a risk of mispricing or improper valuation of the FLEX Options which could impact the value of the Trust's Units. There is no assurance that the Trust could sell or close out a portfolio position for the value established for it at any time, and it is possible that the Trust would incur a loss because a portfolio position is sold or closed out at a discount to the valuation established by the Trust at that time. In addition, the Trust's ability to value investments may be impacted by technological issues or errors by pricing services or other third-party service providers. Investment in the Underlying ETF Risk. Because the Trust holds FLEX Options that reference a fund, Unit holders are subject to the risk that the securities selected by the fund's investment advisor will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds. Further, the fund may in the future invest in other types of securities which involve risk which may differ from those set forth below. The fund referenced by the FLEX Options held by the Trust may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. As a result, the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers, experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers. ETFs Risk. ETFs are investment pools that hold other securities. The FLEX Options represent indirect positions in the Underlying ETF, which is an ETF, and are subject to risks associated with changes in value of the Underlying ETF, such as the following: - Index Correlation and Tracking Error Risk. While the Underlying ETF is intended to track the performance of the Underlying Index, the Underlying ETF's returns may not match or achieve a high degree of correlation with the return of the Underlying Index. Index correlation risk is the risk that the performance of an index-based ETF will vary from the actual performance of the fund's target index, known as ""tracking error."" This can happen due to transaction costs, market impact, corporate actions (such as mergers and spin- offs) and timing variances. In addition, it is possible that the Underlying ETF may not always fully replicate the securities contained in the Underlying Index. - Market Trading Risk. The Underlying ETF is structured as a unit investment trust registered under the 1940 Act. Unlike typical open-end funds or unit investment trusts, ETFs generally do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value. Shares of ETFs may trade at a discount from their net asset value in the secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk that the net asset value of the ETF shares may decrease. The amount of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response to various factors. ETFs generally sell and redeem shares in large blocks (often known as ""Creation Units""). In addition, securities exchanges list ETF shares for trading, which allows investors to purchase and sell individual ETF shares at current market prices throughout the day. ETFs therefore possess characteristics of traditional open-end funds and unit investment trusts, which issue redeemable shares, and of corporate common stocks or closed-end funds, which generally issue shares that trade at negotiated prices on securities exchanges and are not redeemable. - Passive Investment Risk. The Underlying ETF is a passively-managed index fund that seeks to replicate the performance and composition of the Underlying Index. As a result, the Underlying ETF will hold constituent securities of the Underlying Index regardless of the current or projected performance on a specific security or particular industry or market sector. Maintaining investments in the securities regardless of market conditions of the Page 22 performance of individual securities could cause the Underlying ETF's returns to be lower than if it employed an active strategy. Counterparty Risk. Trust transactions involving a counterparty are subject to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the Trust. Counterparty risk may arise because of the counterparty's financial condition (i.e., financial difficulties, bankruptcy, or insolvency), market activities and developments, or other reasons, whether foreseen or not. A counterparty's inability to fulfill its obligation may result in significant financial loss to the Trust. The Trust may be unable to recover its investment from the counterparty or may obtain a limited recovery, and/or recovery may be delayed. The OCC acts as guarantor and central counterparty with respect to the FLEX Options. As a result, the ability of the Trust to meet its objective depends on the OCC being able to meet its obligations. In the unlikely event that the OCC becomes insolvent or is otherwise unable to meet its settlement obligations, the Trust could suffer significant losses. Tax Risk. The Trust intends to treat any income it may derive from the FLEX Options as ""qualifying income"" under the provisions of the Code applicable to regulated investment companies (""RICs""). In addition, based upon language in the legislative history, the Trust intends to treat the issuer of the FLEX Options as the referenced asset, which, assuming the referenced asset qualifies as a RIC, would allow the Trust to qualify for special rules in the RIC diversification requirements. If the income is not qualifying income or the issuer of the FLEX Options is not appropriately the referenced asset, the Trust could lose its own status as a RIC. Regulated Investment Company Qualification Risk. To maintain its status as a RIC, the Trust must distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt interest income annually. In addition, to avoid a non-deductible excise tax, the Trust must distribute at least 98% of its ordinary income and at least 98.2% of its capital gain net income. The Trust has entered into option agreements with the same counterparty and taken the position that the option agreements are separate agreements. Under general tax principles, a regulated investment company would not accrue income on separate option agreements during the term of the agreements. However, if the agreements are treated as one agreement, the Trust might be required to accrue income currently during the term and make annual distributions of income. If the Trust is required to accrue income but does not distribute the income to the investors, the Trust may fail to qualify as a regulated investment company. In addition, if the agreements are treated as one agreement, the Trust may fail either or both of the RIC income and diversification tests. Separately, depending upon the circumstances, sales to fund redemptions could cause the Trust to recognize income that the Trust is required to distribute to maintain the Trust's RIC status and avoid the excise tax. Funding such distributions could require additional sales, which could require more distributions and affect the projected performance of the Trust. Alternatively, if the Trust only makes distributions to maintain its RIC status and becomes subject to the excise tax, that could also affect the projected performance of the Trust. In either case, the assets sold to fund redemptions, distributions or pay the excise tax will not be available to assist the Trust in meeting its target outcome. If the Trust fails to qualify as a regulated investment company, it will be subject to tax as a C corporation. Section 1258 Risk. Section 1258 of the Internal Revenue Code requires the gain from conversion transactions to be recharacterized as ordinary income. The Trust contains a straddle, which would generally produce ordinary income or short term capital gain. When a transaction sold as producing capital gains from certain types of investments, including straddles that create a return tied to the time value of money, the transaction may be treated as a conversion transaction, and all gain from the transaction may be treated as ordinary income. Early Trust Termination Risk. The Trustee has the power to terminate your Trust early in limited cases as described under ""Amending or Terminating the Indenture"" including if the value of the Securities owned by the Trust as shown by any evaluation is less than the lower of $2,000,000 or 20% of the total value of Securities deposited in the Trust during the initial offering period. This could result in a reduction in the value of Units and result in a significant loss to investors. Distributions Risk. If the amount of cash in the Income and Capital Accounts of the Trust are insufficient to provide for expenses and other amounts payable by the Trust, the Trust may sell Securities to pay such amounts. These sales may result in losses to Unit holders and the inability of the Trust to meet its investment objective. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its size or composition. Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that a particular security, or Units of the Trust in general, may fall in value or underperform other investments. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic, political, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. The Federal Reserve has begun to lower interest rates and may continue to do so in the future. Potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking Page 23 industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Additionally, challenges in commercial real estate markets, including declining valuations and elevated vacancies, could have a broader impact on financial markets. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, political turbulence or other events could have a significant negative impact on the Trust and its investments. The ongoing adversarial political climate in the United States, as well as political and diplomatic events both domestic and abroad, have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the U.S. regulatory landscape, markets and investor behavior, which could have a negative impact on the Trust's investments and operations. The change in administration resulting from the 2024 United States national elections could result in significant impacts to international trade relations, tax and immigration policies, and other aspects of the national and international political and financial landscape, which could affect, among other things, inflation and the securities markets generally. Administrative actions against companies in certain industries, such as the defense industry, prohibiting them from paying dividends or engaging in stock buybacks, may negatively impact the performance of such companies and the Trust's investments. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Iran, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities could have a significant impact on certain Trust investments as well as Trust performance. The economies of the United States and its trading partners, as well as the financial markets generally, may be adversely impacted by trade disputes, including the imposition of tariffs, and other matters. A public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks in response, could cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Such events may affect certain geographic regions, countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. Advancements in technology may also adversely impact markets and the overall performance of the Trust. For instance, the economy may be significantly impacted by the advanced development and increased regulation of artificial intelligence. Additionally, cybersecurity breaches of both government and non-government entities could have negative impacts on infrastructure and the ability of such entities, including the Trust, to operate properly. Such events could adversely affect the prices and liquidity of the Trust's portfolio securities and could result in disruptions in the trading markets. Any such circumstances could have a materially negative impact on the value of the Trust's Units and result in increased market volatility. Absence of an Active Market in the Underlying ETF Risk. The Underlying ETF faces numerous market trading risks, including the potential lack of an active market for Underlying ETF shares due to a limited number of market markers or authorized participants. The Underlying ETF may rely on a small number of third-party market makers to provide a market for the purchase and sale of shares and market makers are under no obligation to make a market in the Underlying ETF's shares. Additionally, only a limited number of institutions act as authorized participants for the Underlying ETF and only an authorized participant may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Underlying ETF and are not obligated to submit purchase or redemption orders for creation units. Decisions by market makers or authorized participants to reduce their role or step away from these activities in times of market stress could inhibit the effectiveness of the arbitrage process in maintaining the relationship between the underlying values of the Underlying ETF's portfolio securities and the Underlying ETF's market price. Any trading halt or other problem relating to the trading activity of these market makers or any issues disrupting the authorized participants' ability to proceed with creation and/or redemption orders could result in a dramatic change in the spread between t",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-23 19:59:55.377538

NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Federal judges rejected DoorDash's, ‌Uber ​Technologies' and Instacart's bids for injunctions ‌to block a series of New York City laws governing food-delivery apps, including ​a requirement that they give customers an option to tip delivery workers when paying.

U.S. District Judge George Daniels in Manhattan ‍said DoorDash and Uber did not show ​a clear likelihood that a requirement that they suggest a minimum 10% tip before customers place orders ​would violate their constitutional ⁠free speech rights.

Daniels said the tipping laws ""advance the city's goals of enhancing cost transparency at the time of checkout, restoring consumer choice, and providing protections to delivery workers.""

Separately, U.S. District Judge John Koeltl in Manhattan rejected Instacart's argument that New York's state legislature forbade the city from mandating the tipping option, and from ‌requiring grocery delivery apps such as Instacart to offer delivery workers the same minimum pay available to ​restaurant delivery ‌workers.

The companies, all based in ‍San Francisco, warned ⁠that the laws could reduce business.

DoorDash and Uber said the tipping disclosure rule would dissuade customers burdened by rising prices and ""tipping fatigue"" from ordering, while Instacart said raising worker pay could lead to higher grocery delivery costs.

Both decisions are dated January 22 and were made public on Friday. The laws take effect on January 26.

MAMDANI CRITICIZED DELIVERY APP INDUSTRY

All three companies said they plan appeals.

""Forcing platforms to solicit a tip before checkout at a time when New Yorkers are ​sick of tipping culture and facing a growing affordability crisis is bad policy,"" a spokesperson for DoorDash said.

Uber's lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for additional comment.

A spokesperson for Instacart, the trade name for publicly traded Maplebear, called Koeltl's decision ""a step in the wrong direction for New York workers and families.""

New York City has had several court battles with delivery app companies, including over a first-in-the-nation law in 2023 that guaranteed minimum pay for workers.

It also accused DoorDash and Uber of making changes, which the city labeled ""design tricks,"" to their platforms since the minimum pay law took effect, costing delivery workers $554 million in tips even as tipping on rival platforms held steady.

New York ​City Mayor Zohran Mamdani has criticized the delivery app industry. Last week, his administration warned DoorDash, Uber, Instacart, Grubhub and other companies to comply with tipping and other worker protection laws.

Sam Levine, commissioner of New York City's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, said the judges' decisions ""ensure that workers ​get paid, and consumers have the option to tip freely.""

One Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server handles all writes. Nearly 50 read replicas spread across multiple regions handle reads. The system processes millions of queries per second while maintaining low double-digit millisecond p99 latency and five-nines availability.

The setup challenges conventional scaling wisdom and offers enterprise architects insight into what actually works at massive scale.

T he lesson here isn’t to copy OpenAI’s stack. It’s that architectural decisions should be driven by workload patterns and operational constraints — not by scale panic or fashionable infrastructure choices. OpenAI’s PostgreSQL setup shows how far proven systems can stretch when teams optimize deliberately instead of re-architecting prematurely.

""For years, PostgreSQL has been one of the most critical, under-the-hood data systems powering core products like ChatGPT and OpenAI’s API,"" OpenAI engineer Bohan Zhang wrote in a technical disclosure. ""Over the past year, our PostgreSQL load has grown by more than 10x, and it continues to rise quickly.""

The company achieved this scale through targeted optimizations, including connection pooling that cut connection time from 50 milliseconds to 5 milliseconds and cache locking to prevent 'thundering herd' problems where cache misses trigger database overload.

Why PostgreSQL matters for enterprises

PostgreSQL handles operational data for ChatGPT and OpenAI's API platform. The workload is heavily read-oriented, which makes PostgreSQL a good fit. However, PostgreSQL's multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) creates challenges under heavy write loads.

When updating data, PostgreSQL copies entire rows to create new versions, causing write amplification and forcing queries to scan through multiple versions to find current data.

Rather than fighting this limitation, OpenAI built its strategy around it. At OpenAI’s scale, these tradeoffs aren’t theoretical — they determine which workloads stay on PostgreSQL and which ones must move elsewhere.

How OpenAI is optimizing PostgreSQL

At large scale, conventional database wisdom points to one of two paths: shard PostgreSQL across multiple primary instances so writes can be distributed, or migrate to a distributed SQL database like CockroachDB or YugabyteDB designed to handle massive scale from the start. Most organizations would have taken one of these paths years ago, well before reaching 800 million users.

Sharding or moving to a distributed SQL database eliminates the single-writer bottleneck. A distributed SQL database handles this coordination automatically, but both approaches introduce significant complexity: application code must route queries to the correct shard, distributed transactions become harder to manage and operational overhead increases substantially.

Instead of sharding PostgreSQL, OpenAI established a hybrid strategy: no new tables in PostgreSQL. New workloads default to sharded systems like Azure Cosmos DB. Existing write-heavy workloads that can be horizontally partitioned get migrated out. Everything else stays in PostgreSQL with aggressive optimization.

This approach offers enterprises a practical alternative to wholesale re-architecture. Rather than spending years rewriting hundreds of endpoints, teams can identify specific bottlenecks and move only those workloads to purpose-built systems.

Why this matters

OpenAI's experience scaling PostgreSQL reveals several practices that enterprises can adopt regardless of their scale.

Build operational defenses at multiple layers. OpenAI's approach combines cache locking to prevent ""thundering herd"" problems, connection pooling (which dropped their connection time from 50ms to 5ms), and rate limiting at application, proxy and query levels. Workload isolation routes low-priority and high-priority traffic to separate instances, ensuring a poorly optimized new feature can't degrade core services.

Review and monitor ORM-generated SQL in production. Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Django, SQLAlchemy, and Hibernate automatically generate database queries from application code, which is convenient for developers. However, OpenAI found one ORM-generated query joining 12 tables that caused multiple high-severity incidents when traffic spiked. The convenience of letting frameworks generate SQL creates hidden scaling risks that only surface under production load. Make reviewing these queries a standard practice.

Enforce strict operational discipline. OpenAI permits only lightweight schema changes — anything triggering a full table rewrite is prohibited. Schema changes have a 5-second timeout. Long-running queries get automatically terminated to prevent blocking database maintenance operations. When backfilling data, they enforce rate limits so aggressive that operations can take over a week.

Read-heavy workloads with burst writes can run on single-primary PostgreSQL longer than commonly assumed. The decision to shard should depend on workload patterns rather than user counts.

This approach is particularly relevant for AI applications, which often have heavily read-oriented workloads with unpredictable traffic spikes. These characteristics align with the pattern where single-primary PostgreSQL scales effectively.

The lesson is straightforward: identify actual bottlenecks, optimize proven infrastructure where possible, and migrate selectively when necessary. Wholesale re-architecture isn't always the answer to scaling challenges.",https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/2nMZ8lzfqYONXXqLmfp03c/ef9465cd0a706732727d46c445280358/chatGPT-PostgreSQL.jpg?w=800&q=75,N,,2026-01-23 17:03:13.295116

Instead, as described below, the Notes offer a fixed return at maturity if, from its Initial Underlier Value to its Final Underlier Value, the Least Performing Underlier appreciates, remains flat or does not decline below its Digital Barrier Value. Investors should be willing to forgo dividend payments and, if the Final Underlier Value of any Underlier is less than its Barrier Value, be willing to lose a significant portion or all of their investment at maturity. Investors will be exposed to the market risk of each Underlier and any decline in the value of one Underlier may negatively affect their return and will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the values of the other Underliers.

Investing in the Notes involves a number of risks. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page S-9 of the prospectus supplement and “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-9 of this pricing supplement.

The Notes will not be listed on any U.S. securities exchange or quotation system. Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these Notes or determined that this pricing supplement is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

The Notes constitute our unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. The Notes are not deposit liabilities of Barclays Bank PLC and are not covered by the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme or insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or deposit insurance agency of the United States, the United Kingdom or any other jurisdiction.

CONSENT TO U.K. BAIL-IN POWER

Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between us and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority.

Under the U.K. Banking Act 2009, as amended, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise a U.K. Bail-in Power in circumstances in which the relevant U.K. resolution authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met. These conditions include that a U.K. bank or investment firm is failing or is likely to fail to satisfy the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) threshold conditions for authorization to carry on certain regulated activities (within the meaning of section 55B FSMA) or, in the case of a U.K. banking group company that is a European Economic Area (“EEA”) or third country institution or investment firm, that the relevant EEA or third country relevant authority is satisfied that the resolution conditions are met in respect of that entity.

The U.K. Bail-in Power includes any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification and/or suspension power, which allows for (i) the reduction or cancellation of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes; (ii) the conversion of all, or a portion, of the principal amount of, or interest on, or any other amounts payable on, the Notes into shares or other securities or other obligations of Barclays Bank PLC or another person (and the issue to, or conferral on, the holder or beneficial owner of the Notes of such shares, securities or obligations); (iii) the cancellation of the Notes and/or (iv) the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the Notes, or the amendment of the amount of interest or any other amounts due on the Notes, or the dates on which interest or any other amounts become payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; which U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised by means of a variation of the terms of the Notes solely to give effect to the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of such U.K. Bail-in Power. Each holder and beneficial owner of the Notes further acknowledges and agrees that the rights of the holders or beneficial owners of the Notes are subject to, and will be varied, if necessary, solely to give effect to, the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority. For the avoidance of doubt, this consent and acknowledgment is not a waiver of any rights holders or beneficial owners of the Notes may have at law if and to the extent that any U.K. Bail-in Power is exercised by the relevant U.K. resolution authority in breach of laws applicable in England.

For more information, please see “Selected Risk Considerations—Risks Relating to the Issuer—You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ESTIMATED VALUE OF THE NOTES

The final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public, which we refer to as the Initial Valuation Date, based on prevailing market conditions on or prior to the Initial Valuation Date, and will be communicated to investors either orally or in a final pricing supplement.

Our internal pricing models take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize, typically including volatility, interest rates and our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates (which are our internally published borrowing rates based on variables such as market benchmarks, our appetite for borrowing, and our existing obligations coming to maturity) may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal funding rates. Our estimated value of the Notes might be lower if such valuation were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

Our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be less than the initial issue price of the Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of the Notes and our estimated value of the Notes is expected to result from several factors, including any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost that we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs that we may incur in connection with the Notes.

Our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market, nor will it be the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions, Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.

Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value on the Initial Valuation Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately six months after the Issue Date because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes that we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. We made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, which may include the tenor of the Notes and/or any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs that we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.

We urge you to read the “Selected Risk Considerations” beginning on page PS-9 of this pricing supplement.

You may revoke your offer to purchase the Notes at any time prior to the Initial Valuation Date. We reserve the right to change the terms of, or reject any offer to purchase, the Notes prior to the Initial Valuation Date. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes, we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.

The Notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if any of the following statements are true:

●You seek an investment that produces periodic interest or coupon payments or other sources of current income.

●You seek an investment that participates in the full appreciation of any or all of the Underliers rather than an investment with a return that is limited to the Digital Percentage.

●You seek an investment that provides for the full repayment of principal at maturity, and/or you are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that you may lose a significant portion or all of the principal amount of your Notes in the event that the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier falls below its Barrier Value.

●You anticipate that the Final Underlier Value of at least one Underlier will fall below its Digital Barrier Value.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the individual market risk of each Underlier and/or do not understand that any decline in the value of one Underlier will not be offset or mitigated by a lesser decline or any potential increase in the value of any other Underlier.

●You do not understand and/or are unwilling or unable to accept the risks associated with an investment linked to the performance of the Underliers.

●You are unwilling or unable to accept the risk that the negative performance of any Underlier may cause you to lose a significant portion or all of your principal at maturity, regardless of the performance of any other Underlier.

●You seek an investment that entitles you to dividends or distributions on, or voting rights related to, the securities composing the Underliers.

●You cannot tolerate fluctuations in the price of the Notes that may be similar to or exceed the downside fluctuations in the value of the Underliers.

●You seek an investment for which there will be an active secondary market, and/or you are unwilling or unable to hold the Notes to maturity.

●You are unwilling or unable to assume our credit risk for all payments on the Notes.

●You are unwilling or unable to consent to the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by any relevant U.K. resolution authority.

You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment in the Notes. You should reach a decision whether to invest in the Notes after carefully considering, with your advisors, the appropriateness of the Notes in light of your investment objectives and the specific information set out in this pricing supplement, the prospectus, the prospectus supplement and the underlying supplement. Neither the Issuer nor Barclays Capital Inc. makes any recommendation as to the appropriateness of the Notes for investment.

Example 1: The Final Underlier Value of the NDX Index is 150.00, the Final Underlier Value of the RTY Index is 130.000 and the Final Underlier Value of the SPX Index is 140.00.

Because the RTY Index has the lowest Underlier Return, the RTY Index is the Least Performing Underlier. Because the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is greater than or equal to its Digital Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,082.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × Digital Percentage)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × 8.20%) = $1,082.00

Example 1 demonstrates that you will not participate in any appreciation in the value of any Underlier. Even though each Underlier appreciated significantly, the payment at maturity is limited to $1,082.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold.

Example 2: The Final Underlier Value of the NDX Index is 95.00, the Final Underlier Value of the RTY Index is 140.000 and the Final Underlier Value of the SPX Index is 105.00.

Because the NDX Index has the lowest Underlier Return, the NDX Index is the Least Performing Underlier. Because the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is greater than or equal to its Digital Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,082.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × Digital Percentage)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × 8.20%) = $1,082.00

Example 3: The Final Underlier Value of the NDX Index is 125.00, the Final Underlier Value of the RTY Index is 65.000 and the Final Underlier Value of the SPX Index is 95.00.

Because the RTY Index has the lowest Underlier Return, the RTY Index is the Least Performing Underlier. Because the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is less than its Digital Barrier Value but greater than or equal to its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold.

Example 4: The Final Underlier Value of the NDX Index is 80.00, the Final Underlier Value of the RTY Index is 40.000 and the Final Underlier Value of the SPX Index is 150.00.

Because the RTY Index has the lowest Underlier Return, the RTY Index is the Least Performing Underlier. Because the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is less than its Barrier Value, you will receive a payment at maturity of $400.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note that you hold, calculated as follows:

$1,000 + ($1,000 × Underlier Return of the Least Performing Underlier)

$1,000 + ($1,000 × -60.00%) = $400.00

Example 4 demonstrates that, if the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is less than its Barrier Value, your investment in the Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Underlier from its Initial Underlier Value. You will not benefit in any way from the Underlier Return of any other Underlier being higher than the Underlier Return of the Least Performing Underlier.

You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes. Any payment on the Notes, including the repayment of principal, is subject to the credit risk of Barclays Bank PLC.

SELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONS

An investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Underliers or their components. Some of the risks that apply to an investment in the Notes are summarized below, but we urge you to read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to the Notes generally in the “Risk Factors” section of the prospectus supplement. You should not purchase the Notes unless you understand and can bear the risks of investing in the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Notes Generally

●Your Investment in the Notes May Result in a Significant Loss—The Notes differ from ordinary debt securities in that the Issuer will not necessarily repay the full principal amount of the Notes at maturity. If the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is less than its Barrier Value, your Notes will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Underlier from its Initial Underlier Value. You may lose up to 100.00% of the principal amount of your Notes.

●Your Potential Return on the Notes Is Limited to the Digital Percentage—If the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is greater than or equal to its Digital Barrier Value, for each $1,000 principal amount Note, you will receive at maturity $1,000 plus a predetermined percentage of the principal amount. We refer to this percentage as the Digital Percentage, which is equal to 8.20%. If the Final Underlier Value of the Least Performing Underlier is greater than or equal to its Digital Barrier Value, you will receive the maximum payment at maturity of $1,082.00 per $1,000 principal amount Note regardless of any appreciation of any Underlier, which may be significant. Your return on the Notes will be less than the percentage change in the Least Performing Underlier from its Initial Underlier Value to its Final Underlier Value if such percentage is greater than the Digital Percentage.

●No Interest Payments—As a holder of the Notes, you will not receive interest payments.

●Because the Notes Are Linked to the Least Performing Underlier, You Are Exposed to Greater Risk of Sustaining a Significant Loss of Principal at Maturity Than If the Notes Were Linked to a Single Underlier—The risk that you will lose a significant portion or all of your principal amount in the Notes at maturity is greater if you invest in the Notes as opposed to substantially similar securities that are linked to the performance of a single Underlier. With multiple Underliers, it is more likely that the Final Underlier Value of at least one Underlier will be less than its Barrier Value, and therefore, it is more likely that you will suffer a significant loss of principal at maturity. Further, the performance of the Underliers may not be correlated or may be negatively correlated. The lower the correlation between multiple Underliers, the greater the potential for one of those Underliers to close below its Barrier Value on the Final Valuation Date.

It is impossible to predict what the correlation among the Underliers will be over the term of the Notes. The Underliers represent different equity markets. These different equity markets may not perform similarly over the term of the Notes.

●You Are Exposed to the Market Risk of Each Underlier—Your return on the Notes is not linked to a basket consisting of the Underliers. Rather, it will be contingent upon the independent performance of each Underlier. Unlike an instrument with a return linked to a basket of underlying assets in which risk is mitigated and diversified among all the components of the basket, you will be exposed to the risks related to each Underlier. Poor performance by any Underlier over the term of the Notes may negatively affect your return and will not be offset or mitigated by any increases or lesser declines in the values of the other Underliers. If the Final Underlier Value of any Underlier is less than its Barrier Value, you will be fully exposed to the decline of the Least Performing Underlier from its Initial Underlier Value. Accordingly, your investment is subject to the market risk of each Underlier.

●Any Payment on the Notes Will Be Determined Based on the Closing Values of the Underliers on the Dates Specified—Any payment on the Notes will be determined based on the Closing Values of the Underliers on the dates specified. You will not benefit from any more favorable values of the Underliers determined at any other time.

●Contingent Repayment of the Principal Amount Applies Only at Maturity—You should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity. If you sell your Notes prior to such time in the secondary market, if any, you may have to sell your Notes at a price that is less than the principal amount even if at that time the value of each Underlier has increased from its Initial Underlier Value. See “—Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market—Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes” below.

●Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Securities Composing the Underliers—The return on the Notes may not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned the securities composing the Underliers. As a holder of the Notes, you will not have voting rights or rights to receive dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the securities composing the Underliers would have.

●The U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of an Investment in the Notes Are Uncertain— There is no direct legal authority regarding the proper U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Notes, and we do not plan to request a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). Consequently, significant aspects of the tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain, and the IRS or a court might not agree with the treatment of the Notes as prepaid forward contracts, as described below under “Tax Considerations.” If the IRS were successful in asserting an alternative treatment for the Notes, the tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of the Notes could be materially and adversely affected.

In addition, in 2007 the Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on various issues regarding the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. Any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an

investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should review carefully the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders,” and consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the Notes (including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by the 2007 notice), as well as tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.

Risks Relating to the Issuer

●Credit of Issuer—The Notes are unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of the Issuer, Barclays Bank PLC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. Any payment to be made on the Notes, including any repayment of principal, is subject to the ability of Barclays Bank PLC to satisfy its obligations as they come due and is not guaranteed by any third party. As a result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of Barclays Bank PLC may affect the market value of the Notes, and in the event Barclays Bank PLC were to default on its obligations, you may not receive any amounts owed to you under the terms of the Notes.

●You May Lose Some or All of Your Investment If Any U.K. Bail-in Power Is Exercised by the Relevant U.K. Resolution Authority—Notwithstanding and to the exclusion of any other term of the Notes or any other agreements, arrangements or understandings between Barclays Bank PLC and any holder or beneficial owner of the Notes (or the trustee on behalf of the holders of the Notes), by acquiring the Notes, each holder or beneficial owner of the Notes acknowledges, accepts, agrees to be bound by, and consents to the exercise of, any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority as set forth under “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement. Accordingly, any U.K. Bail-in Power may be exercised in such a manner as to result in you and other holders and beneficial owners of the Notes losing all or a part of the value of your investment in the Notes or receiving a different security from the Notes, which may be worth significantly less than the Notes and which may have significantly fewer protections than those typically afforded to debt securities. Moreover, the relevant U.K. resolution authority may exercise the U.K. Bail-in Power without providing any advance notice to, or requiring the consent of, the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes. The exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes will not be a default or an Event of Default (as each term is defined in the senior debt securities indenture) and the trustee will not be liable for any action that the trustee takes, or abstains from taking, in either case, in accordance with the exercise of the U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority with respect to the Notes. See “Consent to U.K. Bail-in Power” in this pricing supplement as well as “U.K. Bail-in Power,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Regulatory action in the event a bank or investment firm in the Group is failing or likely to fail, including the exercise by the relevant U.K. resolution authority of a variety of statutory resolution powers, could materially adversely affect the value of any securities” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Securities Generally—Under the terms of the securities, you have agreed to be bound by the exercise of any U.K. Bail-in Power by the relevant U.K. resolution authority” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

Risks Relating to the Underliers

●Each Underlier Reflects the Price Return of the Securities Composing That Underlier, Not the Total Return—The return on the Notes is based on the performance of the Underliers, which reflects changes in the market prices of the securities composing each Underlier. Each Underlier is not a “total return” index that, in addition to reflecting those price returns, would also reflect dividends paid on the securities composing that Underlier. Accordingly, the return on the Notes will not include such a total return feature.

●Adjustments to the Underliers Could Adversely Affect the Value of the Notes—The sponsor of an Underlier may add, delete, substitute or adjust the securities composing that Underlier or make other methodological changes to that Underlier that could affect its performance. The Calculation Agent will calculate the value to be used as the Closing Value of an Underlier in the event of certain material changes in or modifications to that Underlier. In addition, the sponsor of an Underlier may also discontinue or suspend calculation or publication of that Underlier at any time. Under these circumstances, the Calculation Agent may select a successor index that the Calculation Agent determines to be comparable to the discontinued Underlier or, if no successor index is available, the Calculation Agent will determine the value to be used as the Closing Value of that Underlier. Any of these actions could adversely affect the value of the relevant Underlier and, consequently, the value of the Notes. See “Reference Assets—Indices—Adjustments Relating to Securities with an Index as a Reference Asset” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●There Are Risks Associated with Investments in Securities Linked to the Value of Non-U.S. Equity Securities with Respect to the NDX Index—Some of the equity securities composing the NDX Index are issued by non-U.S. companies. Investments in securities linked to the value of such non-U.S. equity securities, such as the Notes, involve risks associated with the home countries of the issuers of those non-U.S. equity securities. The prices of securities in non-U.S. markets may be affected by political, economic, financial and social factors in those countries, or global regions, including changes in government, economic and fiscal policies and currency exchange laws.

●The Notes Are Subject to Small-Capitalization Companies Risk with Respect to the RTY Index—The RTY Index tracks companies that are considered small-capitalization companies. These companies often have greater stock price volatility, lower trading volume and less liquidity than large-capitalization companies, and therefore Notes linked to the RTY Index may be more volatile than an investment linked to an index with component stocks issued by large-capitalization companies. Stock prices of small-capitalization companies are also more vulnerable than those of large-capitalization companies to adverse business and

economic developments. In addition, small-capitalization companies are typically less stable financially than large-capitalization companies and may depend on a small number of key personnel, making them more vulnerable to loss of personnel. Small-capitalization companies are often subject to less analyst coverage and may be in early, and less predictable, periods of their corporate existences. Such companies tend to have smaller revenues, less diverse product lines, smaller shares of their product or service markets, fewer financial resources and less competitive strengths than large-capitalization companies and are more susceptible to adverse developments related to their products.

●We May Accelerate the Notes If a Change-in-Law Event Occurs—Upon the occurrence of legal or regulatory changes that may, among other things, prohibit or otherwise materially restrict persons from holding the Notes or an Underlier or its components, or engaging in transactions in them, the Calculation Agent may determine that a change-in-law event has occurred and accelerate the Maturity Date for a payment determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion. Any amount payable upon acceleration could be significantly less than any amount that would be due on the Notes if they were not accelerated. However, if the Calculation Agent elects not to accelerate the Notes, the value of, and any amount payable on, the Notes could be adversely affected, perhaps significantly, by the occurrence of those legal or regulatory changes. See “Terms of the Notes—Change-in-Law Events” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

●Historical Performance of the Underliers Should Not Be Taken as Any Indication of the Future Performance of the Underliers Over the Term of the Notes—The value of each Underlier has fluctuated in the past and may, in the future, experience significant fluctuations. The historical performance of an Underlier is not an indication of the future performance of that Underlier over the term of the Notes. The historical correlation between the Underliers is not an indication of the future correlation between them over the term of the Notes. Therefore, the performance of the Underliers individually or in comparison to each other over the term of the Notes may bear no relation or resemblance to the historical performance of any Underlier.

Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest

●We and Our Affiliates May Engage in Various Activities or Make Determinations That Could Materially Affect the Notes in Various Ways and Create Conflicts of Interest—We and our affiliates play a variety of roles in connection with the issuance of the Notes, as described below. In performing these roles, our and our affiliates’ economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes.

In connection with our normal business activities and in connection with hedging our obligations under the Notes, we and our affiliates make markets in and trade various financial instruments or products for our accounts and for the account of our clients and otherwise provide investment banking and other financial services with respect to these financial instruments and products. These financial instruments and products may include securities, derivative instruments or assets that may relate to the Underliers or their components. In any such market making, trading and hedging activity, and other financial services, we or our affiliates may take positions or take actions that are inconsistent with, or adverse to, the investment objectives of the holders of the Notes. We and our affiliates have no obligation to take the needs of any buyer, seller or holder of the Notes into account in conducting these activities. Such market making, trading and hedging activity, investment banking and other financial services may negatively impact the value of the Notes.

In addition, the role played by Barclays Capital Inc., as the agent for the Notes, could present significant conflicts of interest with the role of Barclays Bank PLC, as issuer of the Notes. For example, Barclays Capital Inc. or its representatives may derive compensation or financial benefit from the distribution of the Notes and such compensation or financial benefit may serve as an incentive to sell the Notes instead of other investments. Furthermore, we and our affiliates establish the offering price of the Notes for initial sale to the public, and the offering price is not based upon any independent verification or valuation.

In addition to the activities described above, we will also act as the Calculation Agent for the Notes. As Calculation Agent, we will determine any values of the Underliers and make any other determinations necessary to calculate any payments on the Notes. In making these determinations, we may be required to make discretionary judgments, including those described in the accompanying prospectus supplement and under “—Risks Relating to the Underliers” above. In making these discretionary judgments, our economic interests are potentially adverse to your interests as an investor in the Notes, and any of these determinations may adversely affect any payments on the Notes.

Risks Relating to the Estimated Value of the Notes and the Secondary Market

●Lack of Liquidity—The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC intend to make a secondary market for the Notes but are not required to do so, and may discontinue any such secondary market making at any time, without notice. Barclays Capital Inc. may at any time hold unsold inventory, which may inhibit the development of a secondary market for the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the Notes, the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which Barclays Capital Inc. and other affiliates of Barclays Bank PLC are willing to buy the Notes. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly, you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.

●Many Economic and Market Factors Will Impact the Value of the Notes—The value of the Notes will be affected by a number of economic and market factors that interact in complex and unpredictable ways and that may either offset or magnify each other, including:

othe values and expected volatility of the Underliers;

ocorrelation (or lack of correlation) of the Underliers;

othe time to maturity of the Notes;

odividend rates on the components of each Underlier;

ointerest and yield rates in the market generally;

oa variety of economic, financial, political, regulatory or judicial events;

osupply and demand for the Notes; and

oour creditworthiness, including actual or anticipated downgrades in our credit ratings.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Expected to Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is expected to be lower, and may be significantly lower, than the initial issue price of your Notes. The difference between the initial issue price of your Notes and the estimated value of the Notes is expected as a result of certain factors, such as any sales commissions expected to be paid to Barclays Capital Inc. or another affiliate of ours, any selling concessions, discounts, commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries, the estimated profit that we or any of our affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes, the estimated cost which we may incur in hedging our obligations under the Notes, and estimated development and other costs which we may incur in connection with the Notes.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Might Be Lower If Such Estimated Value Were Based on the Levels at Which Our Debt Securities Trade in the Secondary Market—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on a number of variables, including our internal funding rates. Our internal funding rates may vary from the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market. As a result of this difference, the estimated values referenced above might be lower if such estimated values were based on the levels at which our benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market.

●The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Based on Our Internal Pricing Models, Which May Prove to Be Inaccurate and May Be Different from the Pricing Models of Other Financial Institutions—The estimated value of your Notes on the Initial Valuation Date is based on our internal pricing models, which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of subjective assumptions, which may or may not materialize. These variables and assumptions are not evaluated or verified on an independent basis. Further, our pricing models may be different from other financial institutions’ pricing models and the methodologies used by us to estimate the value of the Notes may not be consistent with those of other financial institutions which may be purchasers or sellers of Notes in the secondary market. As a result, the secondary market price of your Notes may be materially different from the estimated value of the Notes determined by reference to our internal pricing models.

●The Estimated Value of Your Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market, If Any, and Such Secondary Market Prices, If Any, Will Likely Be Lower Than the Initial Issue Price of Your Notes and May Be Lower Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes—The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing topurchase, which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted, such as market conditions, and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades, and may be substantially less than our estimated value of the Notes. Further, as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market, and do not take into account our various costs related to the Notes such as fees, commissions, discounts, and the costs of hedging our obligations under the Notes, secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be lower than the initial issue price of your Notes. As a result, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc., other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions, if any, will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes, and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.

●The Temporary Price at Which We May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market and the Value We May Initially Use for Customer Account Statements, If We Provide Any Customer Account Statements at All, May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes—Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Initial Valuation Date, the price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if Barclays Capital Inc. makes a market in the Notes, which it is not obligated to do) and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed our estimated value of the Notes on the Initial Valuation Date, as well as the secondary market value of the Notes, for a temporary period after the initial Issue Date of the Notes. The price at which Barclays Capital Inc. may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

You should review carefully the sections in the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Notes Treated as Prepaid Forward Contracts” and, if you are a non-U.S. holder, “—Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders.” The following discussion, when read in combination with those sections, constitutes the full opinion of our special tax counsel, Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP, regarding the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of owning and disposing of the Notes.

Based on current market conditions, in the opinion of our special tax counsel, it is reasonable to treat the Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes as prepaid forward contracts with respect to the Underliers. Assuming this treatment is respected, upon a sale or exchange of the Notes (including redemption at maturity), you should recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your tax basis in the Notes, which should equal the amount you paid to acquire the Notes. This gain or loss on your Notes should be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if you hold your Notes for more than a year, whether or not you are an initial purchaser of Notes at the original issue price. However, the IRS or a court may not respect this treatment, in which case the timing and character of any income or loss on the Notes could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, in 2007 the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released a notice requesting comments on the U.S. federal income tax treatment of “prepaid forward contracts” and similar instruments. The notice focuses in particular on whether to require investors in these instruments to accrue income over the term of their investment. It also asks for comments on a number of related topics, including the character of income or loss with respect to these instruments; the relevance of factors such as the nature of the underlying property to which the instruments are linked; the degree, if any, to which income (including any mandated accruals) realized by non-U.S. investors should be subject to withholding tax; and whether these instruments are or should be subject to the “constructive ownership” regime, which very generally can operate to recharacterize certain long-term capital gain as ordinary income and impose a notional interest charge. While the notice requests comments on appropriate transition rules and effective dates, any Treasury regulations or other guidance promulgated after consideration of these issues could materially and adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, possibly with retroactive effect. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, including possible alternative treatments and the issues presented by this notice.

Treasury regulations under Section 871(m) generally impose a withholding tax on certain “dividend equivalents” under certain “equity linked instruments.” A recent IRS notice excludes from the scope of Section 871(m) instruments issued prior to January 1, 2027 that do not have a “delta of one” with respect to underlying securities that could pay U.S.-source dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (each an “Underlying Security”). Based on our determination that the Notes do not have a “delta of one” within the meaning of the regulations, we expect that these regulations will not apply to the Notes with regard to non-U.S. holders. Our determination is not binding on the IRS, and the IRS may disagree with this determination. Section 871(m) is complex and its application may depend on your particular circumstances, including whether you enter into other transactions with respect to an Underlying Security. If necessary, further information regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) will be provided in the pricing supplement for the Notes. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the potential application of Section 871(m) to the Notes.",http://www.streetinsider.com/images/silogo-new.png,N,,2026-01-23 17:02:39.170015

The company's implied volatility remains below the 52-week median, indicating stable investor expectations.

Adobe demonstrates strong financial health with robust margins and consistent revenue growth.

Adobe's (ADBE) share price climbed by $1.91, or 0.64%, reaching approximately $301.63, while options activity presented a mixed sentiment. The options market saw a relatively low volume with 29,000 contracts changing hands, where call options outnumbered put options, resulting in a put/call ratio of 0.45, distinctly below the typical 2.92. This shift indicates a moderately bullish perspective among investors.

The implied volatility (IV30) for Adobe decreased slightly by 0.23 to 29.77, remaining under the 52-week median. This suggests traders anticipate a daily price movement of around $5.66. Additionally, the put-call skew showed signs of flattening, contributing to the overall positive outlook for the stock.

Adobe Inc., a leader in the technology sector, specializes in providing content creation, document management, and digital marketing software and services. The company operates through three main segments: digital media content creation, digital experience for marketing solutions, and publishing for legacy products. With a market capitalization of approximately $122.88 billion, Adobe is a significant player in the software industry.

Financial Health Analysis

Adobe's financial performance is marked by strong revenue growth and profitability. The company reported a revenue of $23.77 billion, with a three-year growth rate of 14.2%. Adobe's operating margin stands at 36.63%, while its net margin is 30%, indicating efficient cost management and profitability.

On the balance sheet front, Adobe exhibits strong financial health with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.57, suggesting a balanced approach to leveraging. The company's current ratio and quick ratio both stand at 1, reflecting adequate liquidity to meet short-term obligations.

Despite a recent insider selling transaction, Adobe maintains a strong Altman Z-Score of 8.09, indicating low bankruptcy risk. The Piotroski F-Score of 7 further underscores the company's financial robustness.

Valuation & Market Sentiment

Adobe's valuation metrics suggest it is trading at attractive levels.

Technical indicators such as the RSI of 30.97 suggest the stock is approaching oversold territory, potentially signaling a buying opportunity. Institutional ownership is high at 80.93%, reflecting confidence from large investors.

Risk Assessment

Adobe's financial health is bolstered by strong grades in financial strength, with a Z-Score of 8.09 and a Piotroski F-Score of 7. However, sector-specific risks such as rapid technological changes and competitive pressures remain pertinent. The company's beta of 1.48 indicates higher volatility compared to the market, which investors should consider.

Overall, Adobe's strong financial metrics, coupled with its strategic positioning in the technology sector, suggest a resilient outlook. Investors should remain cognizant of market dynamics and sector-specific risks while evaluating Adobe's potential as a long-term investment.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C0000098S.png?20,N,,2026-01-23 19:03:03.632642

Key elements of the service include: Enterprise AI platform design: Companies can integrate AI capabilities into existing enterprise systems and workflows without requiring wholesale infrastructure changes using Enterprise Advantage.

The offering, called IBM Enterprise Advantage, brings together IBM consulting services, pre-built AI agents, and governance tools to help companies deploy AI more quickly and safely across the enterprise, the company said.

Enterprise Advantage enables organizations to integrate AI into existing workflows and systems and expand agentic applications using their current cloud environments and AI models.

It does this by combining IBM’s consulting expertise with tools developed through IBM Consulting Advantage, the company’s internal AI-enabled delivery platform. IBM said the internal platform has been used in more than 150 client engagements and has helped improve consultant productivity.

Those experiences shaped how Enterprise Advantage is now being offered to customers to support their own AI initiatives.

The service supports major hyperscalers including AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, as well as IBM watsonx and a mix of open‑ and proprietary models. The service will allow companies to extend existing technology investments rather than replace them.

Addressing the Enterprise AI Execution Gap

A recent IBM Institute for Business Value report highlighted a growing gap between AI ambition and execution. The report found that 79% of executives expect AI to deliver significant business value by 2030. However, only 24% say they have a clear view of where that value will come from.

The report indicated that many organizations still lack the operating models and systems required to support AI at scale.

Enterprise Advantage is designed to help address this gap by providing a structured way to build, integrate, and govern AI agents within existing enterprise platforms.

Key elements of the service include:

Enterprise AI platform design: Companies can integrate AI capabilities into existing enterprise systems and workflows without requiring wholesale infrastructure changes using Enterprise Advantage. IBM cited Pearson, as an example where Pearson is building personalized, AI-powered learning tools for global organizations and individuals. The learning company is also developing a custom internal AI platform to transform its own business operations and drive growth.

Multi‑cloud and model flexibility: Support for major cloud platforms and a mix of open‑ and proprietary AI models, allows organizations to build on existing technology investments.

Pre‑built AI agents and accelerators: Enterprise Advantage will give companies access to a catalog of reusable, industry‑specific AI agents intended to shorten deployment timelines and reduce implementation risk.

Built‑in governance and controls: Enterprise Advantage supports embedded mechanisms for security, compliance, and lifecycle management as AI agents are deployed into production environments. IBM’s research report notes that organizations are increasingly adopting hybrid human‑and‑AI working models, which introduce new governance and risk management requirements as AI becomes more operationally embedded.

Mohamad Ali, senior VP and head of IBM Consulting, said, “Many organizations are investing in AI, but achieving real value at scale remains a major challenge. We have solved many of these challenges inside IBM by using AI to transform our own operations and deliver measurable results, giving us a proven playbook to help clients succeed. Enterprise Advantage brings this framework to clients by combining human expertise with digital workers and ready-to-use AI assets so they can scale AI with confidence and achieve meaningful impact.”

What This Means for ERP Insiders

Enterprise AI is shifting from experimentation to operating mode. IBM’s launch reflects growing pressure on large organizations to move beyond pilots and define how AI fits into core operating models. The emphasis is on repeatable architectures that can scale across the enterprise and deliver value while working within existing systems.

Agentic AI raises the architectural bar for ERP environments. As AI agents take on more orchestration and decision-support roles, ERP systems must allow AI to work directly with live business data, rather than sitting outside core processes. This increases the importance of platform design and interoperability over point functionality.",https://erp.today/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/carson-masterson-0mXw-dvuLok-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 17:03:00.296037

Analyst price targets averaging $17.75 imply 209% upside from current levels, with 7 of 9 analysts rating the stock buy or strong buy despite the company remaining unprofitable

Small-Cap Speculation Faces Eli Lilly Reality

Altimmune's $561 million market cap and $210 million cash position contrast sharply with competitors. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), which dominates the obesity drug market with Mounjaro and Zepbound, posted 54% revenue growth in its most recent quarter and maintains a $975 billion market cap with 48% operating margins. The stock is up 59% year-to-date but down 18.7% over the past year, reflecting volatility around its 52-week range of $2.90 to $7.73. For speculative investors willing to bet on regulatory acceleration and potential acquisition interest, the Reddit community is making a loud case, but this remains a high-risk, pre-revenue biotech play in a space dominated by pharmaceutical giants.

It’s Time To Rethink Passive Investing

For more than a decade, the investing advice aimed at everyday Americans followed a familiar script: automate everything, keep costs low, and don’t touch a thing. And increasingly, investors are realizing that being completely hands-off also means being completely disengaged.

That realization hits like a lightning bolt when you realize not just how much better your returns could be, but that there are amazing offers like one app where new self-directed investing accounts funded with as little as $50 can receive stock worth up to $1,000.

Contributor Cale Hunt brings to Windows Central more than nine years of experience writing about laptops, PCs, accessories, games, and beyond.","NVIDIA's next conquest, after what feels like years of rumors, is laptops. No, I'm not talking about mobile RTX graphics cards. This is an entirely new processor designed to run Windows on Arm.

The rumors really kicked off in 2023 when NVIDIA was reported to be weighing its options regarding an ARM SoC designed for Windows PCs, and in July 2025, we got a much more significant leak in the form of a Geekbench OpenCL benchmark listing. Earlier this week, we covered a DigiTimes report suggesting that supply chains are gearing up to launch laptops featuring the NVIDIA N1X chip in Q1 2026.

Now, a fresh leak from dataminer Huang514613 gives us an insight into what sort of PCs we might expect. The leak was not hard to spot, at least as long as you aren't shy about poking around in support documents.

On one of Lenovo's ""Legion Space"" public webpages, support for its software includes a long list of applicable Legion gaming laptops. Included in the listings are the regular collection of Intel and AMD configurations, but there's something there that's not like the others.

A Legion 7 15N1X11 stands out as the only product to not feature the usual ""I"" (for Intel) or ""A"" (for AMD) product number. That can't be anything other than NVIDIA's N1X SoC.

Huang514613 follows up the original leak with another X post listing other ""known N1 products from Lenovo."" These include:

Ideapad Slim 5 14N1V11

Ideapad Slim 5 16N1V11

Yoga Pro 7 15N1V11

Yoga Pro 7 15N1X11

Yoga 9 2-in-1 16N1X11

These leaks ultimately fly in the face of assumptions that NVIDIA's N1X was a chip designed for use in desktop PCs. It could very well still be found in desktops, but the fact that it's arriving for laptops — including a 15-inch Legion 7 and a 16-inch Yoga 9 2-in-1 — is exciting, to say the least.

So far, we can only go on leaked and rumored specs to flesh out the N1X. But what we do know bodes well for mobile PC gaming, creation, and AI workloads.

If the N1X is indeed the same chip used in NVIDIA's DGX Spark, we're looking at 20 ARM cores and an integrated Blackwell graphics chip with 6,144 CUDA cores. That's enough to theoretically place its performance alongside the desktop-class RTX 5070. If true, the N1X would be among the fastest iGPUs available in any laptop.

Aligning with rumors of an N1X launch in early 2026, Microsoft has been busy preparing a significant Windows 11 26H1 update. It's a full OS upgrade that moves Windows from the Germanium platform release to Bromine, unlocking platform changes required for Snapdragon X2 and NVIDIA N1X.

Microsoft also rolled out public support for the Xbox PC app on Windows on Arm this week, noting that its Prism emulation layer now supports 85% of games available through the subscription.

Delta has already implemented the three-tier fares for its economy and Comfort tickets.
“We’re still testing Comfort Basic right now.

Delta Air Lines has unveiled a plan to launch tiered fares for both business and first-class, meaning you could soon snag a cheaper ticket in the coveted cabins.

Company executives hinted during an earnings call on Jan. 13 that the change could happen as early as this year.

Delta CEO Ed Bastian noted that the airline’s goal is to have “three categories for every product, which is Basic, Main and Extra.”

This means that when booking seats in premium cabins, customers will now have an option to book “basic” first-class and business class tickets that don’t include perks like free cancellation and loyalty points, per Travel + Leisure.

Currently, those who fly in premium cabins on Delta can only choose between Classic and Extra, while economy travelers can choose from all three.

The Basic fare will be the cheapest option, but will come with limitations such as a later boarding group or no seat selection. Classic is considered to be Delta’s standard airfare, while the more expensive Extra may include benefits such as mile accrual and refundable tickets.

Delta has already implemented the three-tier fares for its economy and Comfort tickets.

“We’ve been incredibly thoughtful about not going too fast, making sure that we’re measured in that approach,” Joe Esposito, Delta’s executive vice president, said on the call. “We’re still testing Comfort Basic right now. We’re going to expand that for the rest of this year.”

“There’s more we can offer the customer based on what they’re willing to pay,” Esposito said.

Delta launched Comfort Basic on Nov. 19 as a “skinnier” version of its extra-legroom Comfort cabin, The Points Guy shared at the time.

Travelers flying Basic in Delta Comfort still get the premium seat with extra legroom, as well as early boarding, complimentary alcoholic beverages and dedicated overhead bin space.

However, the Basic flyers cannot select their seats in advance, receive fewer SkyMiles and have to pay a cancellation fee if needed.

Delta is the first major US airline to offer lower tiers for first or business fare, though some international carriers such as Qatar Airways, Emirates, Finnair, Air France and Etihad already offer something similar.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/119525621.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2026-01-23 16:02:04.553607

The Nvidia co-founder spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and was asked by BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who is the WEF interim co-chair, about how the rise of AI will change the nature of work.

""First of all, this is the largest infrastructure build-out in human history. That's going to create a lot of jobs,"" Huang said. ""It's wonderful that the jobs are related to tradecraft – we're going to have plumbers and electricians and construction and steelworkers and network technicians and people who install and fit out the equipment.""

""We're seeing quite a significant boom in this area. Salaries have gone up nearly double, and so we're talking about six-figure salaries for people who are building chip factories or computer factories or AI factories,"" Huang said.

""We have a great shortage in that, and I'm really delighted to see so many people in so many countries recognizing this important area,"" he added. ""Everybody should be able to make a great living. You don't need to have a PhD in computer science to do so.""

During his discussion with Fink, the Nvidia CEO went into detail about the different levels of AI infrastructure and how they rely upon each other.

Extreme Networks Launches New Partner Program To Position Specialists Against Network Heavyweights

Extreme Networks makes this week’s Came to Win list for its launch of a new partner program that seeks to meet the changing networking market needs of enterprise customers while providing simplicity for channel partners.

The Extreme Partner First program simplifies deal registration, serves up more transparent pricing, offers new training and certifications, and uses AI to improve time to revenue and profitability with less friction, according to Joe Spencer, Extreme’s senior vice president of global channel and strategic initiatives.

“Our program has been around for quite some time. It was designed for what the market needed several years ago, and we listened to our partners and redesigned for what they need today,” Spencer told CRN. “I want partners to know that we’re going to do business with them in a simple and predictable fashion that builds trust between us and them and that if we go to market together, they know what to expect, and that they’re going to solve their needed customer outcomes with ease with Extreme versus our competition.”

Extreme Partner First offers a unified rebate structure, quicker deal approvals, and clearer pricing and benefits for partners. For more predictable profitability, the program provides one global, SKU- and volume-based rebate model and a unified global framework for deal registration with a 48-hour target approval for service level agreements that makes it easier for partners to pursue and scale international opportunities.

Extreme will also help partners close deals faster thanks to its new Partner AI Sales Assistant, a feature that helps partners find critical sales information in seconds, the Morrisville, N.C.-based company said.

Through new training opportunities, partners can earn combined certifications for installation and troubleshooting, with a specific focus on AI readiness and use cases within the company’s flagship Extreme Platform ONE.

D&H Acquires Fulfillment.com In Third-Party Logistics Play

D&H made a savvy acquisition this week, buying Fulfillment.com, a Savannah, Ga.-based provider of technology for e-commerce fulfillment, in a move the IT distributor said will expand its Scale third-party logistics and supply chain services business.

Fulfillment.com is a top provider of e-commerce fulfillment services to high-volume, multi-channel and omni-channel internet retailers worldwide. The company says it ships millions of business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) orders to over 150 countries.

D&H told CRN the acquisition is focused on expanding the capabilities of D&H’s Scale business and strengthening the distributor’s ecommerce fulfillment and third-party logistics operations. D&H Scale is an in-house supply chain management organization that offers end-to-end B2B and B2C commerce capabilities.

D&H Scale is independent of D&H’s core technology distribution strategy and the Fulfillment.com acquisition does not involve changes to channel programs, partner engagement models or distribution operations.

But while Fulfillment.com is focused on B2C distribution, the company’s technology could be a boon to D&H’s channel partner community through enhanced third-party logistics capabilities, expanded direct-to-consumer fulfillment, an improved global e-commerce infrastructure,and advanced technology-driven logistics.

Fulfillment.com has four fulfillment centers in the U.S. and one each in Canada, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Australia. The company says that in the U.S., it can make one-day to two-day delivery to 99.97 percent of the continental U.S. population and can make next-day delivery by ground to 69 percent of that population.

ConnectWise Buys Service Desk Agentic AI Startup

Staying on the topic of strategic acquisitions, ConnectWise this week acquired Toronto-based Zofiq, an agentic AI company with technology that automates high-volume service desk operations, in a move to push toward more autonomous service delivery for MSPs.

The acquisition deal brings about 15 Zofiq employees into the Tampa, Fla.-based vendor and folds the startup’s technology directly into ConnectWise’s broader platform strategy: embedding AI agents inside PSA and RMM workflows.

“This has always been part of our strategy,” ConnectWise CEO Manny Rivelo (pictured) told CRN. “How do we move the company toward autonomous workflows? When you look at Zofiq, it just feels like a great marriage. The timing is right, the technology is ready and the industry needs it.”

Service desks are under pressure from every direction, according to Rivelo. Service ticket volumes keep climbing, talent is hard to find and harder to keep, and customers expect faster, more consistent outcomes, he said. With Zofiq, AI agents handle tasks like triage, routing, resolution steps and documentation—all within existing workflows.

Zofiq’s approach ingests ticket data and learns from it. “At the core of Zofiq is our learning engine. It trains on historical data, learns how an MSP works, and automates based on that. In the old world, you automated by building workflows. In the post-AI world, you automate by letting AI learn from your data and guiding it with natural language,” said Lee Silverstone, Zofiq co-founder and CEO.

Claroty Raises $150M In New Funding Amid Industry Segment Consolidation

Claroty, a developer of security for cyber-physical systems, makes this week’s list for raising an impressive $150 million in a Series F funding round.

Funding from the new round, which was led by Golub Growth with participation from earlier investors, will be targeted for expansion globally, including potentially through mergers and acquisitions.

With the new capital infusion, Claroty has raised at least $885 million in total funding since its launch in 2015.

Claroty did not disclose a new valuation for the company following the new funding round, but the company said it had experienced 80 percent growth in valuation since the previous funding round in March 2024. A published report said Claroty was eyeing a possible IPO in 2027.

The announcement of Claroty’s new funding comes amid consolidation in the market for vendors specializing in OT and IoT security. Nozomi Networks disclosed in September that it had reached an agreement to be acquired by Mitsubishi Electric for roughly $1 billion.

ServiceNow Beefs Up Channel Program With AI Emphasis

ServiceNow this week unveiled a number of enhancements to its channel program, including the launch of a new partner business value composer designed to make it easier for solution providers to help speed customers’ adoption of the latest AI technologies.

The company is also offering partners new certifications in different product areas, as well as bringing them the fruit of acquisitions such as ServiceNow’s pending acquisition of agentic AI developer Moveworks.

The changes to the channel program were officially unveiled at ServiceNow’s annual sales kickoff, held this week in Las Vegas.

One initiative ServiceNow is discussing at the sales kickoff is streamlining the incentives the company provides across the deal life cycle, Michael Park (pictured), senior vice president of global partnerships and channels, told CRN.

“We are expanding our strategic investment fund,” Park said. “We’re setting a new market development fund in front of that for demand gen. ... And then we have reseller fees and incentives for deployment. When I came into the job, there were 14 different incentive models. We now have four.”

Another plan introduced at the sales kickoff was simplifying partner membership fees, Park said. “We’re going to roll out a single program membership fee across all the partner types,” he said. “We’ve got too many versions right now. It’s so complicated. Let’s just do one.”",https://www.crn.com/news/channel-news/2026/media_1767c0ecc897fa2a845b017258f7e1dd7f019085e.png?width=1200&format=pjpg&optimize=medium,N,,2026-01-23 13:59:20.080041

The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Sphere-360 catheter with the Affera mapping and ablation system for treating paroxysmal AFib.
Medtronic first won approval for PFA technology to treat AFib in 2023.
In a November earnings call, Geoff Martha, chairman and CEO of Medtronic, discussed the impact of the company’s PFA offerings.","Medtronic is continuing to build out its pulsed field ablation offerings. The Dublin-based company said the Affera Sphere-360 catheter won CE mark for the treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and the first cases of the device used in the Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial were completed.

Sphere-9 is the only all-in-one, dual energy mapping and ablation catheter for treatment of persistent AFib and concomitant CTI-dependent atrial flutter. Medtronic said the Affera system, together with the Sphere-9 catheter, enables physician treatment flexibility with its wide area focal design and 9mm lattice tip that can be used with an 8.5Fr sheath.

Medtronic inherited the device when it acquired Affera in 2022.

The Horizon 360 IDE study is a prospective, single-arm clinical study at centers across the U.S. The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Sphere-360 catheter with the Affera mapping and ablation system for treating paroxysmal AFib.

""The achievement of CE Mark for Sphere-360, as well as the first cases in the U.S. IDE trial, mark two major achievements in our effort to deliver new and better treatments to AFib patients,"" said Rebecca Seidel, president of the Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio. ""We're committed to leading in PFA and bringing meaningful innovation at a regular cadence.""

Medtronic first won approval for PFA technology to treat AFib in 2023.

In a November earnings call, Geoff Martha, chairman and CEO of Medtronic, discussed the impact of the company’s PFA offerings.

According to a Seeking Alpha transcript of the earnings call, Martha said. “In Cardiac Ablation, our PFA franchise is generating just a ton of momentum. We grew 71%, which is a strong acceleration from last quarter's nearly 50% CAS growth. This is the highest growth rate of any company in this large and fast-growing space. We're winning share as our PFA franchise grew over 300% in the U.S., as well as in international markets.

In a series of announcements this week, the artificial intelligence giant behind ChatGPT signaled meaningful shifts in how it plans to scale its technology, and added some safety rails in response to allegations it has been subjected to time and again.

This comes as OpenAI defends its governance history, navigates criticism from co-founder Elon Musk and surrounding legal drama, and strategizes ways to increase recurring revenue.

At the center of it is that it will begin testing advertisements within ChatGPT for users on its free tier and the newly introduced $8-per-month Chat “Go” plan. This marks a new revenue source for the company as it prepares to launch hardware AI products and continues to invest heavily in data centers.

Until now, it primarily relied on investments, partnerships, and subscription revenue to cover its ever-growing computing costs.

ChatGPT ads come with guardrails

OpenAI’s belief has been that its revenue model must grow to support the value intelligence it delivers to its users and organizations. CFO Sarah Friar, in a recent blog post, explained that the company’s monetization strategy has always been direct and simple.

In this informational post, Friar also expanded on what could come next for the company- licensing to IP-based agreements. Further adding, “that is how the internet evolved. Intelligence will follow the same path.”

On X,Sam Altman emphasized that this introduction will not result in any discrepancy in the information provided to its users.

Further clarifying that the need for this step is to ensure ChatGPT remains available to consumers who “don’t want to pay” but want to use it.

The message was echoed by Fidji Somo in her blog post, reinforcing that ads remain a means of aligning revenue with usage, rather than steering behavior. Somo also elaborated that these ads will be used to improve the user experience and will be expanded to allow users to ask questions about the sponsored product.

The move does not come as a surprise, given the rising demand for generative AI tools, and add to that the related costs, which remain high.

Overall, the Supreme Court upheld the appeal, reiterating the CAT’s gatekeeping function as a specialist tribunal, in a ruling that is welcome news for corporate defendants.

To curtail the use of opt-out proceedings as a means of leveraging settlement in weak and frivolous claims, claimant firms will need to put forward an arguable case and demonstrate that opt-in proceedings are not a practicable alternative for the class they purport to represent.

On 18 December 2025, the UK Supreme Court handed down its judgment in the case of Evans v Barclays Bank plc & Ors [2025] UKSC 48, with significant implications for the future of collective proceedings in the United Kingdom. Overturning the Court of Appeal’s decision, the Supreme Court emphasised the importance of the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) exercising its discretion as a specialist body and clarified the relevant factors to consider when deciding whether opt-in or opt-out proceedings are more appropriate.

Background

In 2019, Mr Evans sought permission to bring opt-out collective proceedings against several major banks, including Barclays, seeking damages as part of a ‘follow-on’ claim for anticompetitive infringements relating to foreign exchange trading. The main issue in contention was the mechanism by which the collective action would proceed — specifically, whether the claims should be certified on an opt-in or opt-out basis.

CAT Decision — 31 March 2023

The CAT considered Mr Evans’ application for opt-out certification, referring to section 79(3) of the CAT Rules 2015, which identifies the merits of the case and the practicability of opt-in proceedings as relevant factors. It concluded that Mr Evans failed to articulate a plausible case on causation, potentially justifying strike-out, and determined that opt-in proceedings were practicable for the sophisticated institutional class members, whose losses accounted for a majority of the claim’s value. On this basis, the CAT refused opt-out certification.

Court of Appeal Decision — 9 May 2024

The Court of Appeal overturned the CAT’s judgment, rejecting the emphasis placed by the CAT on its assessment of the merits of the case. The Court of Appeal gave more weight to the fact that opt-in proceedings were unlikely to occur, stating that access to justice considerations were relevant to the assessment of practicability including all members of the class irrespective of their size and sophistication, not solely for consumers and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The cost of opt-in proceedings and the practical burdens associated with opting in would likely exceed the sums at stake for most of the class members, thereby limiting the practicability of opt-in proceedings and favouring opt-out certification. Accordingly, it set aside the CAT’s decision and remitted the case, prompting an appeal from the banks to the Supreme Court.

Supreme Court Decision — 18 December 2025

The Supreme Court examined the decision to intervene with the CAT’s reasoning and disagreed with the Court of Appeal, overall reaffirming the CAT’s ability to exercise discretion as a specialist tribunal.

1. Merits of the Claims

Firstly, the Supreme Court agreed that the strength of Mr Evans’ claim was an important factor, as section 79(3)(a) of the CAT Rules expressly identifies. It also observed that opt-out proceedings legally and commercially favour claimants, as the procedure enables the representation of a larger class. This often results in higher value claims and increased costs for corporate defendants, which may be leveraged to advance weak and frivolous claims. To preserve the balance between access to justice for claimants and protection for corporates against oppressive litigation, the courts should not allow weaker claims to proceed on an opt-out basis. The Supreme Court therefore held that the Court of Appeal had no basis for interfering with the CAT’s decision.

2. Practicability of Opt-In Proceedings

On the issue of practicability, the CAT was correct to divide the class into subclasses. The potential claimants ranged from sophisticated commercial entities and financial institutions to individuals and smaller entities. The CAT gave foremost attention to the sophisticated entities who accounted for most of the value of the claim. Those institutions were capable of pursuing litigation on an opt-in basis but had made a conscious and deliberate decision not to do so. Opt-out certification should not be used as an alternative route in cases where opt-in proceedings fail to generate sufficient interest. The CAT exercised its discretion to divide the class and came to a reasoned decision, and there was no basis for the Court of Appeal to interfere.

3. Neutral Starting Point

The Court of Appeal adopted a starting position in favour of opt-out proceedings, taking the view that it must uphold principles of vindicating rights and deterring future wrongdoers as powerful factors favouring certification. However, the Supreme Court disagreed, confirming that judicial decision-makers must adopt a position of neutrality with no presumption in favour of either procedure when determining certification. The Supreme Court held the CAT was correct to adopt an even-handed approach, weighing factors on both sides to strike a balance between competing interests, and to exercise its judgment as a specialist tribunal without interference from the appellate courts in the absence of an error of law.

A More Exacting Certification Process

Overall, the Supreme Court upheld the appeal and reiterated the CAT’s gatekeeping function as a specialist tribunal, in a ruling that is welcome news for corporate defendants. As identified in the October 2025 report we published in conjunction with Kendal Global Advisory, businesses have reported increased liability risk and exposure to damages resulting from the strategic utilisation of the collective redress regime by claimant firms, as well as concerns that claimant interests are not at the forefront of such actions. This decision — one amongst a number of recent appellate court judgments shaping the collective and class actions landscape — raises the threshold for opt-out certification and reflects the court’s increasing attentiveness to the practical and procedural realities of such large-scale litigation.

A recent earnings release and 2026 guidance update, though strong, triggered a price pullback and a trend-following opportunity.

What is a trend-following signal? Assuming the trend is up, as it is with JNJ stock, a trend-following signal occurs when the price action retreats to an accepted trend-following indicator, such as a moving average or trend line, and then confirms support at that level. What this does is affirm the presence of buyers and high potential for rebound while derisking the entry point. The likely outcome of such a signal is that the stock price will continue its steady advance and set fresh highs in the near future.

Johnson & Johnson’s Healthy Business and Pipeline Underpin Stock Price Action

Johnson & Johnson’s Q4 results reveal the strength of its portfolio and pipeline, with revenue up 9.1% YOY and nearly 200 basis points better than expected. The strength was driven by the combination of core strength in Innovative Medicine and Med Tech, compounded by acquisitions. The company grew organically by 7.1% and adjusted by 6.1%, and expects to sustain a mid-single-digit pace in 2026.

Margins, which were roughly in line with consensus expectations, were an area of strength in the report. The company’s adjusted earnings, like margins, were as expected, showing significant improvement compared to the prior year.

Up more than 20%, adjusted earnings strengthened the already strong balance sheet and capital return outlook.

Management's guidance was good—and likely to be cautious. The company targets 6.7% revenue growth and margin improvement, with both targets above consensus.

Momentum in core segments (specifically with blockbusters like Darzalex) and pipeline advancement, could cause the firm to beat on its own guidance next report.

Lastly, the company reported positive results from several trials and submitted its OTTAVA robotic surgical system for De Novo classification. If approved, it will open a new revenue stream with potential to grow at a high-double-digit rate for several years.

Johnson & Johnson Results Align With Bullish Analyst Trends

Johnson & Johnson’s bullish analyst trends are unlikely to end, given the Q4 strengths and outlook. As it stands, the 29 tracked by MarketBeat rate this stock as a Moderate Buy and price targets are rising.

The consensus price target implies the stock is fairly valued, trading near the pre-release close, but the trend points to the high end of the range, sufficient for a 10% upside and a fresh all-time high.

Institutions also accumulated in 2025 and early 2026, limiting the downside risk should the stock price pull back.

Johnson & Johnson’s dividend is among the reasons analysts and institutions like this stock. The payment yields nearly 2.5%, even with shares near record highs, and is expected to grow over time.

The company is a Dividend King with over 60 years of annual increases to its credit. A low payout ratio of 50% signals that modest, single-digit increases can be sustained for the foreseeable future.

Risks for JNJ shareholders in 2026 include ongoing talc litigation, competition from Stellara biosimilars, and execution risk tied to the expected OTTAVA launch. Talc litigation is being allowed to advance, with the plaintiff’s expert testimony to be allowed. This is a hurdle for the company, but it will be allowed to refute the testimony. Meanwhile, Stelara lost its patent protection in 2025 and will face increasing competition as the year progresses. Sales of Stelara, which accounted for approximately 11.5% of 2024 revenue, fell more than 40% in 2025.

FactSet Barclays Partnership Tests Growth Narrative After Share Price Slide

January 23, 2026

FactSet Research Systems (NYSE:FDS) has entered a multiyear partnership with Barclays to support the bank's long term market data strategy.

The collaboration will see FactSet provide data and analytics capabilities to Barclays across its global operations.

The agreement signals deeper integration of FactSet's platforms into a major financial institution's core workflows.

For investors watching FactSet at a share price of $288.79, this new Barclays agreement comes after a mixed performance record. NYSE:FDS shows a 1.4% gain year to date, but the stock has seen a 37.1% decline over the past year and is lower over the 3 year and 5 year periods. That backdrop makes large client wins particularly important to how you might think about the business today.

The Barclays partnership could influence how you assess FactSet's competitive position in high value enterprise data contracts, an area where scale and client stickiness tend to matter. While the revenue and margin impact are not detailed here, investors may want to watch for future disclosures around adoption, product scope, and any expansion of the relationship into additional business lines.

This agreement looks like a meaningful validation of FactSet's role in enterprise data, since Barclays is tying a long term market data plan to FactSet's analytics and technology. For you as an investor, the key angle is that Barclays is not just buying a single product; it is standardising on a suite of tools, which can deepen usage over time if FactSet is embedded across desks and regions.

FactSet Research Systems narrative, does this Barclays deal move the needle?

Recent concerns around slowing revenue growth and a 31.8% share price decline over six months have fed a narrative that FactSet is a mature business without much excitement. A large global bank choosing FactSet to power its market data strategy may challenge that view slightly, because it speaks to relevance with tier one clients even as growth has moderated.

Risks and rewards to weigh from this partnership

🎁 A multiyear, broad product rollout at Barclays can support perceptions of dependable earnings and help justify fair value assessments that already factor in a reliable 1.52% dividend.

🎁 The agreement may reinforce existing views that FactSet is still winning business, with earnings having grown 9.4% per year over five years and forecasts pointing to 6.13% annual growth.

⚠️ Execution risk remains, since FactSet still has a high level of debt and must deliver smoothly on complex implementation and service requirements for a global bank.

⚠️ Investors may want to see whether this is a one off win or part of a broader pattern of similar deals before revising expectations around long term growth.

What to watch next

From here, it is worth tracking any quantified disclosures on contract value, product adoption across Barclays' business lines, and whether other large institutions reference similar partnerships with FactSet.

What Is Agilent Technologies' Investment Narrative?

To own Agilent, you need to be on board with a measured, innovation-led story rather than a hyper-growth one. The company is generating solid revenue of US$6,948.0 million and earnings of US$1,303.0 million, but its share price has lagged both the broader US market and the Life Sciences industry over the past year. The launch of the S540MD slide scanner fits neatly into Agilent’s push deeper into digital pathology and AI tools, but on its own it is unlikely to shift the near term earnings outlook or the consensus price target, which already sits about a fifth above the current share price. The more immediate catalysts remain execution on moderate earnings growth, management’s relatively new tenure, and how comfortably investors accept a valuation above some fair value estimates.

However, there is one key execution risk around new management and capital allocation that investors should not ignore. Agilent Technologies' share price has been on the slide but might be up to 22% below fair value. .

Exploring Other Perspectives

Five fair value estimates from the Simply Wall St Community span roughly US$113 to US$169 per share, underlining how far apart private investors can be. Against that backdrop, Agilent’s push into AI enabled pathology and a relatively new management team give you plenty of reasons to compare several viewpoints before deciding how much of its future you want to price in.

- why the stock might be worth as much as 22% more than the current price!

On January 13, Christine Cho, CFA, from Barclays, reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $146 price target. However, earlier on January 9, Goldman Sachs had maintained a Neutral rating on Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) with a $106 price target.

​The ratings follow the company’s agreement with Meta to develop a 1.2 GW Nuclear Energy at Pike County, Ohio. Management of Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) noted that, under the agreement, Meta will prepay for the power and provide capital to ensure the project is completed successfully. Management noted that they plan to use the capital to advance phase 1 of the project on the land that has already been acquired, along with securing fuel for the plant. The pre-construction work is expected to start this year, with the first phase of the plant coming online in 2030.

​According to Goldman Sachs, each GW of powerhouse deployment will add roughly $15 to $20 per share to the company’s stock, based on the DCF analysis. The firm also noted that Meta is pursuing other nuclear deals, which it views as positive for companies in the nuclear segment.

​Oklo Inc. (NYSE:OKLO) develops advanced nuclear power plants that recycle nuclear waste to provide clean, reliable energy, supporting sustainable solutions for the increasing power demands of AI.

“I think we can produce tools, and I think we can do it easily now with AI that we couldn't before,” Abell said.","Healthcare cybersecurity is a Gordian Knot problem—complex, difficult, and essential—but AI might provide the sword.

Andrea Abell, CISO at pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, is utilizing the technology available for all sorts of tasks. During a conversation with IT Brew at CES earlier this month, Abell said she uses AI “across the board.” Defenders should assume threat actors are doing the same.

“If we are looking to defend [against] generative AI, we have to think about all of the places that an attacker can take advantage of it,” Abell said.

Seeking out. Likening threat detection to finding a needle in a haystack, Abell said that she believes AI can make the haystack smaller and speed up the hunt, especially when combined with human knowledge. Agentic AI also has a role to play, especially in threat modeling.

“We’re doing what everyone else is doing, which is making agents to help reduce the human workload,” Abell said. “All of this new technology requires new defenses, new tooling, all of those types of things.”

In the healthcare sector, workers are often the last line of defense against hackers—and attacks can come when the focus is on saving lives, not protecting systems. John Riggi, national advisor for cybersecurity and risk at trade and lobbying group the American Hospital Association (AHA), told IT Brew in November that cybersecurity is an important part of any healthcare organization’s setup.

“Cyber hygiene is as important as medical hygiene to help protect patients from harm,” Riggi said.

Part of making that happen, said Alex Tyrrell, SVP and CTO of the health division at Wolters Kluwer, is ensuring there’s device security alongside the implementation of AI solutions.

“Training is going to be a key aspect and maintaining these guardrails, make sure the controls are in place,” Tyrell told IT Brew in December.

Get it right. Yes, there will be challenges. But Abell remains optimistic and hopeful about the future of AI-assisted cybersecurity in the healthcare space. Implementing change in the supply chain for vendor security, as well as modeling threats, requires a serious effort on the part of IT pros at Eli Lilly.

Abell added that she hopes initiatives like secure by default, which are being implemented by companies like Amazon and Microsoft, will help to offer a framework for small, rural healthcare centers and hospitals.

“I think we can produce tools, and I think we can do it easily now with AI that we couldn't before,” Abell said. “That’s what I’m most excited about.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/8fe871abfaf7960b7d06933c9dee6aae5e1eced9-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2026-01-23 12:43:02.843750

WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) – U.S. business activity was steady in January as an improvement in new orders was offset by a lackluster labor market and lingering concerns among firms over higher costs because of import tariffs, a survey showed on ‍Friday.

S&P Global said its flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index, which tracks the manufacturing and services sectors, inched down to 52.8 this month from 52.7 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the private sector. Both services and manufacturing flash PMIs were little changed this month.

S&P Global said the composite PMI was consistent with a moderation in economic growth at the turn of the year.

The government reported on ‌Thursday that the economy grew at a 4.4% annualized pace in the ‌third quarter, driven by strong consumer and business spending on intellectual property products, likely related to artificial intelligence, as well as a smaller trade deficit.

The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting gross domestic product increasing at a 5.4% rate in the October-December quarter. The fourth-quarter GDP report, delayed by the 43-day government ​shutdown, will be published on February 20.

The survey continued to paint a picture of labor market stagnation, which S&P Global said reflected concerns over rising costs and softer sales growth in ‍recent months. Its measure of private sector employment edged up ​to 50.5 from 50.3 last month.

Some businesses reported difficulties finding staff, which ​could be linked to an immigration crackdown that economists say has reduced labor supply.

TARIFFS ARE WIDELY BLAMED ‍FOR INCREASED COSTS

The survey’s gauge of prices asked by firms for goods and services ticked down to 57.2, still among the highest recorded over the last three years, from 57.3 in December.

A measure of prices paid for inputs fell to a still-high 59.7 from 61.9 last month.

The elevated price measures suggest that inflation could remain high for some time. Businesses have absorbed ‍some of the duties from President Donald Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs, helping to avert a much feared big inflation surge. The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged next week while policymakers watch ‍inflation and the labor market.

“Increased ‍costs, widely blamed on tariffs, are again cited as a key driver ​of higher prices for both goods and services in January, meaning ​inflation and ⁠affordability remains a widespread concern among businesses,” said Chris Williamson, chief business ‌economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The survey’s measure of new orders received by businesses rose to 52.2 from 50.8 in December. But exports fell to a nine-month low, pulled down by declines in both goods and services.

Business confidence weakened, dropping slightly below the average seen last year. S&P Global said “the demand-dampening impact of higher prices, geopolitical worries and federal government policies remained a concern among many firms.”

The Sphere-360 catheter was designed in response to physician feedback showing the need for a simple, differentiated workflow and predictable outcomes using a single catheter that accommodates anatomical variations in pulmonary veins. The catheter boasts an adjustable configuration lattice design that conforms to the shape of the veins and allows energy delivery without needing to rotate the catheter in each position.

“The Sphere-360 catheter offers an excellent balance between ease of use and consistency in outcomes. Its design conforms to the pulmonary vein in a unique way that delivers consistent, effective and durable lesions for AFib patients, without any rotation of the catheter,” said Tobias Reichlin, MD., Director of Electrophysiology at Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. “With the full integration into the Affera mapping system, it’s an exciting step forward for patient care in Europe.”

It delivers circumferential, consistent lesions from the entire 34 mm lattice without catheter rotation.

Real-time local impedance information assesses catheter proximity to tissue, as well.

Polestar Capital e-Mobility & Infrastructure Fund (PCEIF) was launched in February 2025 with a target of €500 million and a €1 billion hard-cap.
“That may have been one of the triggers because Polestar Capital was earning quite good money from that mandate,” one source said.
The firm previously had three other funds in capital raising, which have now either been suspended or sold: PCEIF; Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds); and Polestar Capital Circular Debt Fund (PCDF).
Fund strategy PCEIF is an infrastructure credit fund that invests in the energy transition by providing senior-secured loans to businesses supplying low-carbon transport solutions.","Utrecht-based Polestar Capital has halted fundraising for its flagship sustainable infrastructure debt strategy, Infrastructure Investor has learned.

Polestar Capital e-Mobility & Infrastructure Fund (PCEIF) was launched in February 2025 with a target of €500 million and a €1 billion hard-cap. The fund was expected to hold a €500 million first close on its target by the end of 2025, with a final close anticipated on its hard-cap in Q3 2026.

Sources with knowledge of the matter said that the manager suspended fundraising after encountering financial difficulties. As a result, Polestar has embarked on an organisational restructuring and implemented a new business strategy.

“They [Polestar] decided to do a reorganisation, which meant that half of the staff left,” one source stated, noting the departures included the biodiversity team and the PCEIF investment unit.

Meanwhile, another source echoed this view: “PCEIF is on hold for the moment; it’s not fundraising because things are not going well.”

When approached for comment, a spokesperson at Polestar disputed that the firm had experienced financial challenges. The firm acknowledged that it had paused fundraising for PCEIF, but stated the decision was in response to feedback from investors to widen and diversify the scope of the strategy.

Infrastructure Investor understands that one of the potential causes for the alleged financial challenges could be the loss of one of its earnings streams and key mandate – the Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds) – in 2024.

It is understood that the manager sold its brokerage operations in December 2024, including the activities related to the Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds).

“That may have been one of the triggers because Polestar Capital was earning quite good money from that mandate,” one source said. “That mandate was given back to the [Dutch] government.”

Crucially, sources suggested investors grew concerned after learning of the firm’s alleged financial constraints in June and July 2025, leading some to withdraw their interest. At that time, PCEIF had been in advanced discussions with several large Dutch institutional investors and some international investors who were conducting due diligence.

Sources added that the manager was anticipating that three or four investors would contribute more than €100 million each to the strategy. These investors – including pension schemes and insurance companies from the Netherlands and abroad – were expected to provide the €500 million required for the vehicle’s first close by the end of Q4 2025.

Polestar denied that investors had withdrawn their interest due to concerns over the manager’s financial position.

Infrastructure Investor understands that despite the suspension, efforts are being explored to continue the strategy, either under a new GP or within the sustainability arm of an existing manager. Sources also pointed to ongoing discussions with potential GPs in Germany, the UK and the Netherlands about taking over the fund or strategy.

Another source suggested Polestar is likely to reassess whether to resume fundraising for PCEIF once the reorganisation is complete.

The Polestar spokesman signalled the firm may return to market later this year with a broader impact strategy, which could still feature e-mobility as one of its themes.

Infrastructure Investor understands the manager is still in the market with its remaining strategy, Limburg Energy Fund.

The firm previously had three other funds in capital raising, which have now either been suspended or sold: PCEIF; Dutch Heat Fund (Warmtefonds); and Polestar Capital Circular Debt Fund (PCDF).

In December 2025, Colesco Capital, a sustainability-led private credit specialist, acquired the management of PCDF from Polestar and renamed it the Colesco Circular & Climate Credit Impact Fund.

Fund strategy

PCEIF is an infrastructure credit fund that invests in the energy transition by providing senior-secured loans to businesses supplying low-carbon transport solutions.

The vehicle aims to finance a portfolio of 15-30 initiatives, with approximately 80 percent based in the Netherlands and the remainder in Northwestern Europe.

PCEIF deploys capital to e-mobility and charging infrastructure projects, including e-fleets, public charging point operators, and privately-owned depot charging facilities.

The fund targets an 8 percent net IRR, with ticket sizes ranging between €5 million and €75 million, and has a 10-year term with an option to extend for two years.",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1313535992.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 10:41:29.295202

Its design conforms to the pulmonary vein in a unique way that delivers consistent, effective and durable lesions for AFib patients, without any rotation of the catheter,"" said Tobias Reichlin, M.D., Director of Electrophysiology at Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. ""With the full integration into the Affera mapping system, it's an exciting step forward for patient care in Europe.""

Additional benefits of Sphere-360 include:

Delivers circumferential, consistent lesions from the entire 34 mm lattice without catheter rotation, enhancing workflow efficiency

Adapts to the vein by adjusting the shape of the conformable lattice to the patient's anatomy

All-in-one catheter for navigation, mapping, and ablation with a single transseptal puncture and zero catheter exchange

Real-time local impedance information to assess catheter proximity to tissue

Easy access to pulmonary veins with enhanced stability through its over-the-wire design

Compatible with FlexCath Contour™ 10 French deflectable sheath designed for easy catheter positioning

""Advances in electrophysiology over the past several years are having a significant impact on care for arrhythmia patients, and Affera has been a key part of that impact,"" said Vivek Reddy, M.D., Director of Cardiac Arrhythmia Services for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. ""Now with Sphere-360, we have a new and differentiated single-shot PFA catheter with the potential to deliver the next phase of innovation. It's an exciting time for physicians and patients and we're not slowing down.""

Results from the Sphere-360 European study at one year were presented at the Heart Rhythm Society Annual Meeting and published in the Heart Rhythm Journal in April 2025. The prospective, single-arm, multi-center trial in European centers demonstrated excellent efficacy, safety, and durability that led to CE Mark.

""The achievement of CE Mark for Sphere-360, as well as the first cases in the U.S. IDE trial, mark two major achievements in our effort to deliver new and better treatments to AFib patients,"" said Rebecca Seidel, president of the Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio. ""We're committed to leading in PFA and bringing meaningful innovation at a regular cadence.""

The Horizon 360 IDE study is a prospective, single-arm clinical study at centers across the U.S. The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Sphere-360 catheter with the Affera mapping and ablation system for treating paroxysmal AFib.

About Medtronic PFA

Medtronic was the first company with two PFA offerings for physicians and patients. The PulseSelect™ Pulsed Field Ablation System offers physicians a safe, single-shot solution for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) and is now available in more than 35 countries.

Sphere-9™ is the only all-in-one, dual energy mapping and ablation catheter for treatment of persistent AFib and concomitant CTI-dependent atrial flutter. The Affera system, together with the Sphere-9 catheter, enables physician treatment flexibility with its wide area focal design and 9mm lattice tip that can be used with an 8.5Fr sheath. Affera is approved in the U.S., Europe, Australia and New Zealand and Japan, with global expansion ongoing. The Affera Mapping and Ablation System with Sphere-9 Catheter received CE Mark in March 2023 and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in October 2024.

The Sphere-360 catheter is approved in Europe and investigational in the United States. For more information on the Affera system, the Sphere-9 catheter and the Sphere-360 catheter, visit Medtronic.com.

TAVR stands for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, a minimally invasive procedure to replace a diseased aortic valve.","Medtronic will invest up to US$90m in Anteris Technologies to help fund the next stage of growth and the DurAVR transcatheter heart valve programme.

The Australia-founded company said the funding will support execution of its clinical strategy for DurAVR, designed to mimic a healthy human aortic valve and replicate normal aortic blood flow.

Transcatheter heart valves are replacement valves delivered to the heart through a catheter, a thin flexible tube inserted through a blood vessel rather than open heart surgery.

The private placement requires Medtronic to acquire a 16.0 to 19.99 per cent stake in Anteris.

Anteris is also proposing a US$200m underwritten public offering, with underwriters given a 30-day option to spend US$30m to buy additional shares at the offering price, minus underwriting discounts and commissions.

Recruitment is ongoing for the DurAVR transcatheter heart valve global pivotal trial for patients with severe aortic stenosis, known as the Paradigm trial. Aortic stenosis occurs when the aortic valve, which controls blood flow from the heart to the body, becomes narrowed.

The company said it is expanding its manufacturing capabilities.

Jorie Soskin is vice president and general manager of the structural heart business in Medtronic’s cardiovascular portfolio.

Soskin said: “Medtronic is a pioneer in TAVR innovation and evidence.

“Our investment in differentiated innovation like DurAVR THV technology, which has the potential to offer improved valve performance in a balloon-expandable platform, is core to our commitment to define and drive the future of TAVR, meeting the needs of more aortic stenosis patients and heart teams with a comprehensive portfolio.”

Officials said part of the proceeds may also fund research and development for v2vmedtech, Anteris’ partner company, which is developing a next-generation transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system for mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation. This refers to leaky valves that allow blood to flow backwards.

Any remaining funds could be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The fundraising came nearly three months after Anteris announced positive one-year clinical outcomes for DurAVR. The balloon-expandable, biomimetic DurAVR THV is made from a single piece of moulded Adapt tissue, described as the company’s patented anti-calcification bovine tissue technology.

Wayne Paterson, chief executive of Anteris Technologies, said the deal followed 2.5 years of negotiations.

Paterson said Medtronic wanted to acquire the company outright because Anteris’ technology could make it more competitive against TAVR rival Edwards Lifesciences, but it ultimately agreed to an investment that could enable a co-commercialisation partnership and manufacturing collaborations around Minneapolis.

TAVR stands for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, a minimally invasive procedure to replace a diseased aortic valve.

According to a regulatory filing linked to the offering, Medtronic will also have the right to a non-voting board observer and certain negotiation rights in connection with future third-party acquisition proposals.

The investment in Anteris comes after Medtronic’s TAVR competitor Edwards Lifesciences failed to acquire JenaValve due to antitrust concerns from the Federal Trade Commission.",https://www.htworld.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cropped-HTW-3-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-23 09:42:25.448504

Overview

Sandisk Corporation's stock experienced a dramatic 1,117% surge over six months, doubling in the first two weeks of 2026. This rally, attributed to the AI trade's focus on storage and a flash memory shortage enabling price hikes, has generated over $3 billion in mark-to-market losses for short sellers. With short interest rising to 7.5% of the float, S3 Partners flags an 'extreme' risk of a short squeeze.

1. THE SEAMLESS LINK

The escalating short squeeze risk for Sandisk Corporation is a direct consequence of its remarkable stock performance, which has seen shares appreciate over 1,100% in the past six months. This meteoric rise, which accelerated with a doubling in value during the first two weeks of 2026, has placed immense pressure on bearish investors. The company's trajectory is closely watched, especially given the fundamental shifts occurring in the technology sector.

2. THE STRUCTURE

The AI-Fueled Storage Surge

Sandisk Corporation's stock has demonstrated an extraordinary upward trend, climbing 1,117% in the last six months and showing no signs of abatement, even doubling in the initial two weeks of 2026 [6, 9]. This performance has inflicted substantial mark-to-market losses exceeding $3 billion upon short sellers [News1]. According to S3 Partners, short interest has climbed to 7.5% of Sandisk's total float, a significant increase from a prior 4%, elevating the firm's risk score to an 'extreme' level indicative of a potential short squeeze [News1]. A short squeeze materializes when a rapid stock price increase compels short sellers to repurchase shares to cover their positions, often at a loss, which can further amplify the price climb [News1]. As of January 21, 2026, Sandisk's market capitalization stood at approximately $73.47 billion, with its stock trading around $501.29 [7, 9]. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio remains negative on a trailing twelve-month basis, a common characteristic for companies undergoing rapid growth or strategic investment phases, though a forward P/E estimate for 2026 stands at approximately 35.6 [1, 15].

Catalysts Driving Storage Demand

The remarkable rally in Sandisk shares is underpinned by a confluence of factors. The burgeoning artificial intelligence sector has increasingly directed its focus toward storage solutions, recognizing the massive data requirements for AI infrastructure [6, 18, 23]. This heightened demand, coupled with a critical shortage in flash memory supply, has provided Sandisk with the leverage to increase prices [6, 11, 35]. Supporting this narrative, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's pronouncements at the CES Technology conference, where he described the storage space as a ""completely unserved market,"" added considerable positive sentiment towards storage-focused companies [19, 27]. The global memory chip shortage, exacerbated by manufacturers shifting capacity to high-margin AI products like HBM and DDR5, is projected to persist through late 2026 and into 2027, further tightening supply and supporting higher prices for NAND flash [18, 39].

Sandisk's Market Position and Corporate History

Headquartered in California, Sandisk is recognized for its high-performance storage drives, memory cards, and USB flash drives [News1]. Sandisk Corporation (SNDK) completed its separation from Western Digital and began independent trading on the Nasdaq on February 24, 2025 [20, 36]. Since its re-listing, its stock has experienced substantial growth, with reports indicating gains of over 700% by early 2026, and a significant increase from April 2025 to January 2026 [6, 47]. Western Digital, now a pure-play HDD provider post-spin-off, has also seen its stock surge significantly, benefiting from AI-driven demand for high-capacity storage solutions and improved margins [21, 28]. Several investment banks have raised price targets for Sandisk, with Bernstein Société Générale doubling its target to $580, citing unprecedented NAND shortages and price increases [15]. Sandisk is scheduled to announce its fiscal second-quarter financial results on January 29, 2026 [11].

Successful completion of first cases at multiple sites kicks off Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial in the United States

Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), a global leader in healthcare technology, today announced two major milestones for the Affera™ Sphere-360™ catheter, a first-of-its-kind, all-in-one mapping and single-shot pulsed field ablation (PFA) catheter for treatment of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AFib): CE Mark in Europe and the completion of first cases in the Horizon 360 IDE pivotal trial in the United States.

The Sphere-360 catheter was designed in response to physician feedback expressing the need for a simple, differentiated workflow and predictable outcomes using a single catheter that accommodates anatomical variations in pulmonary veins. Seamlessly integrated with the Affera mapping and ablation system, the catheter offers an adjustable configuration lattice design that conforms to the shape of the veins and allows energy delivery without the need to rotate the catheter in each position.

The Affera mapping and ablation system and the Sphere-9™ all-in-one mapping and ablation catheter have been rapidly adopted by physicians in multiple geographies for their excellent safety and durability profile.

""The Sphere-360 catheter offers an excellent balance between ease of use and consistency in outcomes. Its design conforms to the pulmonary vein in a unique way that delivers consistent, effective and durable lesions for AFib patients, without any rotation of the catheter,"" said Tobias Reichlin, M.D., Director of Electrophysiology at Inselspital University Hospital in Bern, Switzerland. ""With the full integration into the Affera mapping system, it's an exciting step forward for patient care in Europe.""

Additional benefits of Sphere-360 include:

Delivers circumferential, consistent lesions from the entire 34 mm lattice without catheter rotation, enhancing workflow efficiency

Adapts to the vein by adjusting the shape of the conformable lattice to the patient's anatomy

All-in-one catheter for navigation, mapping, and ablation with a single transseptal puncture and zero catheter exchange

Real-time local impedance information to assess catheter proximity to tissue

Easy access to pulmonary veins with enhanced stability through its over-the-wire design

Compatible with FlexCath Contour™ 10 French deflectable sheath designed for easy catheter positioning

""Advances in electrophysiology over the past several years are having a significant impact on care for arrhythmia patients, and Affera has been a key part of that impact,"" said Vivek Reddy, M.D., Director of Cardiac Arrhythmia Services for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City. ""Now with Sphere-360, we have a new and differentiated single-shot PFA catheter with the potential to deliver the next phase of innovation. It's an exciting time for physicians and patients and we're not slowing down.""

Results from the Sphere-360 European study at one year were presented at the Heart Rhythm Society Annual Meeting and published in the Heart Rhythm Journal in April 2025. The prospective, single-arm, multi-center trial in European centers demonstrated excellent efficacy, safety, and durability that led to CE Mark.

""The achievement of CE Mark for Sphere-360, as well as the first cases in the U.S. IDE trial, mark two major achievements in our effort to deliver new and better treatments to AFib patients,"" said Rebecca Seidel, president of the Cardiac Ablation Solutions business, which is part of the Cardiovascular Portfolio. ""We're committed to leading in PFA and bringing meaningful innovation at a regular cadence.""

The Horizon 360 IDE study is a prospective, single-arm clinical study at centers across the U.S. The study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Sphere-360 catheter with the Affera mapping and ablation system for treating paroxysmal AFib.

About Medtronic PFA

Sphere-9™ is the only all-in-one, dual energy mapping and ablation catheter for treatment of persistent AFib and concomitant CTI-dependent atrial flutter. The Affera system, together with the Sphere-9 catheter, enables physician treatment flexibility with its wide area focal design and 9mm lattice tip that can be used with an 8.5Fr sheath. Affera is approved in the U.S., Europe, Australia and New Zealand and Japan, with global expansion ongoing. The Affera Mapping and Ablation System with Sphere-9 Catheter received CE Mark in March 2023 and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in October 2024.

The Sphere-360 catheter is approved in Europe and investigational in the United States. For more information on the Affera system, the Sphere-9 catheter and the Sphere-360 catheter, visit Medtronic.com.

About Atrial Fibrillation

AFib is one of the most common and undertreated heart rhythm disorders, affecting more than 60 million people worldwide1. AFib is a progressive disease, often beginning as paroxysmal AFib (presents intermittently) and progressing to persistent (lasts for more than 7+ days without stopping). As the disease progresses, the risk of serious complications including heart failure, stroke and risk of death increases2-5.

Operational information for accessing the measures is available at UniCredit branches throughout the region.","UniCredit has launched extraordinary measures to meet the immediate needs of families and businesses affected by the severe weather in Calabria. This initiative provides financial support to customers residing or headquartered in Calabria.

The severe weather that has hit large areas of Calabria in recent weeks, the institute in Piazza Gae Aulenti explains in a statement, is causing damage to infrastructure, homes, and businesses, placing particular pressure on small towns, agricultural supply chains, local businesses, and widespread tourism. Several areas are experiencing operational difficulties, production slowdowns, and strains on businesses' liquidity, in a context already marked by structural fragility and increasing exposure to extreme weather events.

In this context, UniCredit has made available an ""Emergency Moratorium,"" which allows for the suspension of mortgage payments for up to twelve months for private customers and for mortgage and unsecured loans for businesses, for loans that are in regular repayment and have not incurred any irregularities in the two months prior to the request. Applications must be submitted by March 31, 2026, accompanied by a self-certification certifying the damage suffered. The suspension takes effect from the first available payment following the submission of the request and does not result in negative reports in credit databases.

In addition to the moratorium, a ""New Business Credit"" package is available, which provides financing on favorable terms to support business continuity, the recovery of operations, and initial liquidity needs, subject to a credit assessment. Applications must be received by March 31, 2026. The suspended installments, including interest accrued on the suspended principal only, can be repaid at the end of the original repayment plan, over the remaining term of the mortgage, or in a lump sum in the event of early repayment. The suspension can also be requested for mortgages subject to securitization or the issuance of covered bank bonds and does not constitute contractual novation.

""When an extraordinary weather event hits a region, the priority is to prevent the damage from quickly turning into financial hardship for families and businesses,"" says Ferdinando Natali, Unicredit's Southern Regional Manager. ""Suspending installments and accessing new liquidity allow us to maintain continuity in payments, supplier relationships, and day-to-day operations, at a time when stability is crucial.""

Operational information for accessing the measures is available at UniCredit branches throughout the region.

Omics Lab Services Market

Dublin, Jan. 23, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Omics Lab Services Market - Global Industry Size, Share, Trends, Opportunity, and Forecast, 2021-2031"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The Global Omics Lab Services Market is projected to expand from USD 72.88 Billion in 2025 to USD 128.48 Billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 9.91%. The market is significantly propelled by the increasing integration of personalized and precision medicine, as healthcare providers turn to molecular profiling to customize patient treatments.

This transition from generalized prescribing to targeted therapeutic approaches requires extensive genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic testing, thereby boosting the volume of samples processed by specialized labs. Pharmaceutical developers are heavily investing in biomarker research to validate these targeted therapies, fueling the demand for outsourced, high-complexity testing to ensure regulatory approval and clinical success. According to the Personalized Medicine Coalition's May 2025 report, 'Personalized Medicine at FDA: The Scope & Significance of Progress in 2024,' the FDA approved 18 new personalized medicines in 2024, representing roughly 38% of all newly approved therapeutic molecular entities, which highlights the industry's reliance on advanced omics data.

Concurrently, the rising demand for liquid biopsy and non-invasive diagnostic tools is widening the market scope by facilitating frequent disease monitoring without the risks involved in tissue biopsies. This shift compels service providers to expand their sequencing infrastructure and bioinformatic capabilities to manage the growing influx of complex blood-based biomarker tests needed for cancer surveillance and early detection. Guardant Health reported in its 'Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results' in February 2025 that it processed approximately 206,700 oncology clinical tests during 2024, a 20% increase year-over-year. The financial magnitude of this trend is further demonstrated by Exact Sciences, which reported total revenue of $2.76 billion for the full year 2024 in 2025, largely attributed to the strong uptake of its diagnostic and cancer screening services.

Market Challenges

A major obstacle to the Global Omics Lab Services Market is the intricate regulatory framework governing data privacy and ethical compliance. Because laboratories handle vast amounts of sensitive genetic data, they must implement advanced data protection systems to satisfy strict international requirements. This necessity requires significant resource allocation, which increases operational costs and diverts funds away from research and development, often leading to project delays. Consequently, the financial and technical demands of compliance establish high barriers to entry, deterring smaller, innovative companies and favoring market consolidation among a few large providers.

Additionally, the severe financial implications of data breaches force laboratories to prioritize risk management over service expansion. The costs associated with security failures are prohibitive and pose significant liability concerns; the American Hospital Association's 2025 Environmental Scan report noted that the average cost of a healthcare data breach in 2024 was $9.77 million. Such high risks drive organizations to adopt restrictive data handling protocols, which can impede collaborative research efforts and slow the market's capacity to provide timely and accessible diagnostic solutions.

Market Trends

The integration of Artificial Intelligence for advanced data interpretation is emerging as a cornerstone trend in the omics sector, shifting the focus from delivering raw sequencing data to providing actionable insights. Service providers are increasingly incorporating machine learning algorithms into their bioinformatics workflows to decode complex multi-omics datasets, enabling pharmaceutical clients to discover new therapeutic targets more rapidly and accurately. This evolution toward AI-driven insight generation offers significant revenue potential for technologically advanced labs. For instance, Tempus AI reported in its 'Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Financial Results' in February 2025 that it achieved a total revenue of $693.4 million for the fiscal year 2024, marking a 30.4% year-over-year increase driven largely by its enhanced AI-enabled capabilities.

In parallel, the rise of Spatial Omics and tissue profiling technologies is transforming biological analysis by allowing researchers to map gene expression within the architectural context of tissue. Unlike traditional sequencing methods that dissociate cells, spatial profiling maintains the sample's positional integrity, offering vital insights into tumor microenvironments and cellular interactions crucial for immuno-oncology. This advancement has prompted laboratories to invest significantly in high-plex imaging and spatially resolved transcriptomics to satisfy growing biopharma demand. Highlighting this trend, 10x Genomics reported in its 'Preliminary Select Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results' in January 2025 that it generated approximately $121.1 million in spatial consumables revenue for the full year 2024, demonstrating the rapid industry adoption of these context-aware solutions.

Large companies are vying for our attention, the scenes in front of us, and the sounds in our ears.","Have you noticed that large companies are all deploying their own AI hardware products?

At the Davos Forum, Chris Lane, the global affairs officer of OpenAI, revealed the latest news that OpenAI is progressing as planned and preparing to launch its first AI hardware device in the second half of 2026.

This news has completely stirred up the already anxious tech circle.

This means that the world's top algorithm engines are entering the hardware race. In China, recently, companies like Huawei, ByteDance, and Alibaba are all flocking to the AI hardware market.

You know, in the past decade, Internet companies have been trying to get rid of bulky hardware and pursue a light - asset software model. Now, they are collectively ""reverting to their ancestors"" at all costs and rushing back to the tough hardware market that once gave them a hard time.

Take ByteDance as a typical example. As a software company, its Feishu recently collaborated with Anker Innovations to launch an AI office hardware called ""One Bean"". Before that, people only knew Feishu for its documents, spreadsheets, and video conferencing.

But if you broaden your perspective, you'll find that this is not just Feishu's move. ByteDance, Alibaba, Xiaomi, Baidu, and even Meta and OpenAI across the ocean are all scrambling into the hardware market.

Meta is the most aggressive. According to media reports, Zuckerberg has asked manufacturing partners to double the annual production capacity of AI smart glasses to 20 million pairs by the end of 2026.

Is this another technological upsurge? However, if you look back at the pitfalls these large companies have encountered on the hardware path, you'll find how abnormal this collective influx is.

In the past decade, large companies' attempts at hardware almost always ended in failure, especially in the Chinese market. Baidu made mobile phones, ByteDance acquired Smartisan, Alibaba launched Tmall Genie, and Tencent also tried various social hardware.

What was the result? Either they left with losses or disbanded the departments. It seems that software companies' DNA is not suited to handle hardware.

For large companies to venture into hardware is like jumping into a fire pit.

But in 2026, the hardware trend has not only returned but is even more intense than before.

What exactly is going on behind this? Why are large companies willing to jump into this arduous hardware business again?

1. Why can't software companies do well in hardware?

Before discussing why everyone wants to do hardware now, we need to see why they failed in the past.

You may have forgotten that Tencent once wanted to make mobile phones. Around 2015, Tencent launched the TOS (Tencent OS) system and even collaborated with manufacturers to produce mobile phones. What was the result? There was no splash in the market, and the project was soon halted. After ByteDance acquired Smartisan, it also couldn't escape the fate of failure.

The reason why it's difficult for large companies to do hardware is that they carry the arrogance of Internet companies in their genes.

The logic of Internet companies is to quickly test and iterate. If there is a mistake in an app, programmers can stay up all night to modify the code, and users can resume normal use after an update the next day. In this world, the marginal cost is almost zero. One more user just means a little more server space.

But hardware is a completely different story.

The logic of hardware is a one - shot deal. If there is a one - millimeter error when making a mold, hundreds of thousands of shells will become waste. If you order one less sensor in the supply chain, your entire production line will have to stop. Hardware companies pursue cost control of each part and inventory turnover.

Take the smart speaker war back then. To grab users, large companies sold speakers that cost 200 yuan for 69 yuan or even less. They thought that as long as you bought their speakers, you would use their music services and buy their products.

Users did buy, but they just used the speakers as alarm clocks or radios. The hardware itself didn't make money, and the software services couldn't drive sales either. In the end, these hardware departments became a heavy burden on the company's books.

In short, software companies didn't understand the respect for hardware before. They approached hardware with the same mindset as making apps and were finally taught a lesson by the supply chain and inventory.

2. AI has changed the rules of the game

Since it was so difficult in the past, why do people think it's okay now?

The answer lies in the large - scale AI models. The most important reason is actually just two words: interaction.

In the past, it was difficult to make hardware. You had to design screens, complex menus, and figure out how users would click and press. This required strong industrial design and interaction logic. Software companies' failure in hardware was largely because they designed the hardware too complexly and couldn't handle these physical - level complex interactions.

But after the emergence of large - scale AI models, the situation has changed.

Nowadays, AI hardware no longer needs a screen or even redundant buttons. Look at Feishu's ""One Bean"". Its core interaction is simply listening and speaking.

Take AI glasses as another example. You say a word to the glasses, and they can understand your meaning and execute directly. This interaction method has lowered the threshold of hardware.

Software companies have found that they don't need to study how to make a perfect touch screen. They only need to do a good job on the ""brain"" (AI model), and the hardware only needs to provide a microphone, camera, and chip.

Nowadays, hardware has essentially become a sensor for AI.

Take the Plaud Note product as an example. It sells well because it addresses the pain point that the iPhone can't record calls. But do users really buy it just for recording? No. Users buy it for the summarization, transcription, and translation after recording.

Without a model like ChatGPT behind it, this recording pen would just be ordinary electronic waste. It's AI that gives these simply - structured hardware devices the ability to think and summarize.

Software companies suddenly realized that they don't need to compete with Apple and Huawei in terms of precise industrial design. They only need to make a simple carrier and install their AI models into it.

For Feishu, the original intention of making ""One Bean"" is definitely not to make money from selling hardware, but to let Feishu's AI go beyond computers and mobile phones. If you're in an offline meeting or on the road while driving and can't open your computer to write a document, ""One Bean"" becomes your external brain.

In short, what software companies are best at has now become the core competitiveness of hardware.

3. ByteDance, Meta, and OpenAI are all betting on one thing

You may ask, since software is so powerful, why not just make apps as before? Why do they have to get involved in making hardware themselves?

Imagine the scenario in 2026. If you're wearing Meta's glasses or OpenAI's headphones and you have a need. For example, you want to schedule a meeting at 3 p.m.

Will you take out your phone, unlock it, find the Feishu icon, click on it, and then look for the calendar?

Most likely not. You'll just say to the glasses: Schedule a meeting for me.

At this time, the AI Agent in the glasses will directly handle the matter for you. In this process, the Feishu app completely disappears. It becomes a ""plug - in"" that provides data in the background.

This is fatal for large software companies.

If users no longer open the app, large companies will lose direct control over users. They can't see users' behavior habits, can't push ads to users, and can't sell other value - added services. They become workers for hardware manufacturers.

Feishu's making of ""One Bean"", Meta's making of glasses, and OpenAI's making of headphones are all essentially about defending their interaction entrances. They must have their own hardware carriers to ensure that when users have a need, they turn to their AI first, not others'.

Whoever controls the hardware closest to users' ears and eyes controls users' habits.

In short, ByteDance, Meta, and OpenAI are all betting on one thing: What if users don't click on apps?

This is a battle for the right to control the user entrance and the first interface.

4. Data scarcity, and even more panic without data

Besides seizing the entrance, there is a more hidden reason: AI has exhausted the data on the Internet.

You may not know that the current AI models are facing an embarrassing reality. The high - quality text data on the Internet is almost used up.

According to a report by the Epoch AI Research Institute, the high - quality English language data may run out between 2026 and 2032. In China, the data of each large company is self - contained and not open.

If AI wants to continue to evolve, it must find new data sources.

Where is this data? It's in our real life.

The data on the Internet is ""dead"" and processed by others. But the conversations in the real world, the scenes you see, and the tone in your meetings are real - time data.

AI hardware is essentially a 24 - hour detector.

When you wear AI glasses and enter a supermarket or use an AI recording pen in a meeting, AI is learning in real - time how humans handle real - world problems. It can see your logic in choosing products and hear your negotiation skills.

This first - person audio - visual data from the physical world is the scarcest resource for training the next - generation AI at present.

By selling hardware, large software companies are actually installing countless eyes and ears around the world. The data sent back to the cloud can make their models smarter and more understanding of human behavior logic.

Why do large companies make AI hardware? They don't care about the hardware profit. What they want is the real world in front of you.

5. Hardware is no longer a heavy asset

Why do people think they can succeed this time? Because large companies have become smarter and no longer try to handle everything by themselves.

Previously, when large companies made hardware, they took on everything from circuit board design to mold - making and factory production scheduling. As a result, it was not only slow but also lacked professionalism.

Now the trend is cooperation. For example, recently Doubao collaborated with ZTE to make mobile phones, and Feishu's choice to work with Anker Innovations on ""One Bean"" is a typical sign. It has to be said that ByteDance has mastered the dual - mode of software and hardware well.

Anker Innovations is a world - leading consumer electronics company. Their understanding of hardware such as the supply chain, batteries, and audio chips is world - class, and their supply - chain advantage is very strong. Anker Innovations provides the hardware carrier and distribution channels. Feishu provides the AI model and connects the office ecosystem.

This division of labor has significantly reduced the trial - and - error cost for software companies.

Feishu doesn't need to study how to make a non - heating charging chip, and Anker Innovations doesn't need to train a large - language model. This ""Lego - style"" assembly model has shortened the hardware R & D cycle from the previous 18 months to the current 6 months or even less.

Hardware is no longer a heavy asset but has become a plug - in that can be quickly iterated.

The production cycle of hardware has been shortened, and the risks have been shared. This makes large companies think that it's worth jumping into this ""fire pit"" again.

[Beyond the Page] Words:

The AI hardware trend in 2026 seems lively but is actually full of helplessness.

The collective move of software companies into hardware is essentially a fear of the end of the mobile Internet era. People have found that the walls of apps can no longer withstand the impact of AI. If you don't turn yourself into a physical entity that users carry around, you'll be forgotten by users.

But we also need to think about a question: Do we really need so many AI recording pens, glasses, and headphones?

The progress of technology is supposed to make people's lives easier. But now, we seem to be surrounded by more sensors. Large companies are vying for our attention, the scenes in front of us, and the sounds in our ears.

When the large - scale model finds its carrier, it is no longer just an icon in the phone but becomes a part of our body.

Is this human evolution or another deep penetration into our lives?","https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20260123/v2_c5b4ce30ed5f4130ab317e3df97b6e5e@000000_oswg62034oswg946oswg403_img_000?x-oss-process=image/resize,m_mfit,w_600,h_400,limit_0/crop,w_600,h_400,g_center",N,,2026-01-23 11:01:02.855369

LONDON Art Fair features works from two modernist homes built in the late 1930s and run by the National Trust, the show’s museum partners, at its 2026 season opener.

The NT is Europe’s largest conservation charity, with 360-plus buildings in its care, and 2 Willow Road, Hampstead, by Ernő and Ursula Goldfinger and The Homewood, in Esher, by Patrick Gwynne, were both designed by the architects as family homes to include art.

Pieces on show include those by Henry Moore, Max Ernst, Prunella Clough, and more from Hampstead; and from Esher, most notably three works on paper by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska.

The 38th LAF is up and running at the Business Design Centre in Islington* and continues until Sunday, see www.londonartfair.co.uk for full details.

More than 120 galleries from home and abroad are represented, selling some excellent modern and contemporary art, complemented by an impressive programme of talks and tours throughout.

The Platform presentation, guest curated by Dr Ferren Gipson, is on the theme of The Unexpected, with artists challenging “conventions in material, process, and form in their work”.

An Encounters section has “the freshest contemporary art” from some 23 galleries, and among them IDENTITY – Ukrainian Artists’ Community, most of whom have moved to the UK owing to the war.

They offer a variety of styles and techniques on the theme “geometry of the universe”.

Siger Gallery’s exhibit “focuses on anxious artistic practices”, both challenging and unnerving.

Guillermo Monroy’s mixed media sculpture Speechless, for example, particularly so; with a masked young female as if coffined in a violin case.

And the Cole Levi-Klimt stand has a more overt religious theme, which includes an intriguing take on the Madonna and Child by Paul Freud.

With both smaller and larger galleries at the fair there’s enormous choice.

From oils by LS Lowry (price on application) and rare early works by David Hockney to oils from Walter Sickert, Ivon Hitchens, Kyffin Williams and many, many, more.

And, of course, there are up-to-date pieces, some just delivered in time for this week; something to interest every visitor, from fun pieces to photography, textiles, and “explorations” that aim for something else. It’s so vast a fair that highlights are entirely personal choice.

Horton London has a poignant World War I bronze, A Tired Soldier by William McMillan, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1918, showing a serviceman sitting in the mud, his steel helmet in his hands.

UBP said on Friday that strong market performance added 14.1 billion francs, which was effectively offset by negative currency effects of 14.1 billion francs, driven mainly by the dollar’s decline against the franc.

The bank attributed the step-change primarily to the acquisition of Société Générale’s private banking businesses in Switzerland and the UK, both finalised in 2025. Excluding acquisitions, net new money was 2.7 billion francs, supported by activity in expansion markets including Asia, the Middle East, and Monaco.

Management Frames 2025 as Execution Under Pressure

CEO Guy de Picciotto pointed to delivery through adverse FX, falling rates, and acquisition–related costs, saying: «In 2025, our Bank once again delivered strong results… we achieved a healthy profit margin, reflecting a good balance of external and organic growth.»

Total income reached 1.51 billion francs, up 12.5 percent versus 2024, with the net result from interest operations at 546.1 million francs, up 13.1 percent.

Net fees and commissions income climbed 13.1 percent to 843.6 million francs, which UBP linked to stronger transactional activity – particularly in developing markets and Asia toward year-end.

OpenAI executives, meanwhile, debuted new education, health and cybersecurity initiatives, framing the moves as part of a push to ensure all markets — not just the US — see gains from the technology. At a press huddle, Brad Lightcap, the company’s chief operating officer, quoted the sci-fi author William Gibson: “The future is already here — it’s just not evenly distributed.” Lightcap added: “That very much rings true on this.”

The rhetoric hints at the anxiety of this moment for AI. Many investors are getting antsy to see significant commercial growth that justifies the sector’s enormous expenditures and lofty valuations. OpenAI, an unprofitable startup, has committed to spend more than $1.4 trillion on data centers and chips for AI in the coming years, including striking several deals with cloud providers and chipmakers that have been criticized as circular.

Anthropic earned the most buzz at the conference, thanks to Claude Cowork, a new tool that’s gone viral in tech circles for being intuitive and tackling a wider range of work tasks on the user’s behalf.

Here follows a statement by the Royal Office :

""Following the 35th African Cup of Nations, hosted with great enthusiasm by the Kingdom of Morocco from December 21st, 2025 to January 18th, 2026, His Majesty the King Mohammed VI, may God assist Him, wishes to convey His gratitude to all members of the Nation, who have contributed admirably to the full success of this wonderful event.

His Majesty the King particularly wishes to congratulate all citizens, across various cities of the Kingdom, for the efforts deployed, and to thank each and every one for their valuable contribution to this historic success, which has been acknowledged and acclaimed worldwide.

The Sovereign also addresses His congratulations to millions of Moroccan women, men and children who, in an exemplary manner and each in their own way, tirelessly supported their national team, currently ranked 8th best national team in the world. Such remarkable result, fruit of a high-level proactive sports and infrastructure policy, as well as the patriotic choice made by talented youth of Moroccan Expatriates to opt for the national team’s jersey and to defend its colors with pride and gusto.

This edition of the continental competition will stand as a milestone, as, beyond its sporting outcomes, it made for a gauge for the Kingdom’s major leap on the path to development and progress, fruit of a long-term vision and a unique and efficient Moroccan model which puts the citizen at the heart of all ambition.

Moreover, even if this major continental football celebration hosted by the Kingdom appears to have been sadly marred by the unfortunate events of the final minutes of the match between the national teams of Morocco and Senegal, during which regrettable incidents and deeply deplorable behavior occurred, it remains nonetheless that, once passions have subsided, inter-African fraternity will naturally prevail, for this Moroccan success is also an African success. Morocco remains proud to have offered, on its soil, a month of popular joy and sporting emotion, and to have contributed to the prominence of Africa and its football.

Furthermore, in view of the denigration and attempts at discrediting sustained, His Majesty the King, may God assist Him, remains convinced that hostile schemes will never reach their aims, and that Moroccan people know to balance matters and not to be drawn into resentment and discord. Nothing will alter the closeness that was fostered over centuries between our African people, nor the fruitful cooperation built hand in hand with different countries of the Continent, bolstered by ever ambitious partnerships.

The Kingdom of Morocco is and shall remain a great African country, faithful to the spirit of brotherhood, solidarity and an always nurtured mutual respect towards its Continent.

In accordance with the enlightened Vision of the Sovereign, Morocco will further its resolute and steadfast commitment in favor of a united and prosperous Africa, notably through mutual exchange of experiences, expertise and knowledge.""",,N,,2026-01-23 11:43:38.684706

Let's dig into Taiwan Semi's earnings results and explore why the company's outlook bodes well for top players in the semiconductor industry.

Taiwan Semi just reported monster earnings

In the fourth quarter, Taiwan Semi generated $33.7 billion in revenue. This was about $300 million above the company's previously issued guidance, and represented growth of 25% year over year and 2% sequentially.

Perhaps even more encouraging is the company's profitability profile. In Q4, TSMC posted a gross margin of 62% -- roughly 330 basis points higher compared to the same period in 2024.

The combination of robust acceleration across the top line and widening gross profits fueled meaningful expansion in operating margins and earnings per share (EPS) for Taiwan Semi.

During the earnings call, the company's CEO, C.C. Wei, hinted that Taiwan Semi would use this excess cash flow to continue investing in next-generation foundries -- referring to the ongoing infrastructure boom as a ""multiyear AI megatrend.""

Taiwan Semi should be thought of as a pick-and-shovel player along the chip value chain. While Nvidia and Broadcom design different types of semiconductors meant for generative AI development, TSMC is the company behind the scenes bringing this hardware to life.

Taiwan Semi is the largest chip manufacturer in the world in terms of revenue. With a market share hovering around 70%, both Nvidia and Broadcom rely heavily on TSMC's fabrication expertise in order to fulfill their respective backlog orders. Taiwan Semi's current growth trajectory and encouraging forward guidance is especially good news for Nvidia and Broadcom investors.

TSMC's results validate that hyperscalers like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- some of Nvidia's largest customers -- are accelerating their AI infrastructure roadmaps.

Taiwan Semi's ability to manufacture advanced processing nodes such as 5 nanometer and 3 nanometer at scale matters greatly for Nvidia. The reason this is important is because higher profit margins and increased output from TSMC suggest that Nvidia's chips are both in high demand and being converted into shipped revenue more quickly.

Broadcom benefits from TSMC's success for a different reason than its GPU counterpart. Broadcom's value in AI infrastructure comes from designing networking gear for data centers, custom silicon architectures, and connectivity chips. Many of these specialty processes are also manufactured by Taiwan Semi.

TSMC's booming business underscores the idea that AI budgets aren't entirely consumed by GPUs. Rather, the hyperscalers are deploying capital across a broad suite of critical infrastructure beyond general-purpose training hardware.

In other words, the resiliency of Taiwan Semi's business suggests that the current infrastructure supercycle differs materially from the historical cyclicality of the semiconductor industry. Developers are investing beyond raw compute and opting for a full hardware stack to build out their AI systems.

Should you buy Taiwan Semi stock right now?

Taiwan Semi currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24. While the company has experienced meaningful valuation expansion over the last year, TSMC's forward earnings multiple trades at a steep discount to prior highs.

In my eyes, the compression in the company's valuation multiple could suggest that investors have not yet priced in the entirety of Taiwan Semi's growth prospects over the next several years. In other words, despite a strong earnings report and encouraging outlook, some investors may still be suspicious that AI is a bubble and therefore are not assigning premium valuations.

To me, TSMC's latest report should mitigate the bubble fears. The company's growth is accelerating across the board, and management has been explicit about its expansion plans. I think Taiwan Semi is positioned for significant revenue and profit growth through the rest of the decade, making now an interesting time to buy the stock at a reasonable price point.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F851887%2Ftaiwan-semiconductor-tsmc-building-with-tsmc-logo-in-front_tsmc-9.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2026-01-23 07:58:27.878399

The announcement, made the day that the Sundance Film Festival debuted in Utah, holds promise in particular for many smaller and independent creative shops (such as those dozens of indie projects on display during Sundance) in both entertainment and marketing for enterprises.

The announcement includes partnerships with Hollywood’s Big Three talent agencies (UTA, WME and CAA); hybrid and AI film-production companies Wonder Studio, Promise.ai, Infinite Studio and B5 Studios; Parsons School of Design and two other art colleges; design studio Cantina Creative; and prominent directors David Ayer and Jaume Collet-Serra.

Anna’s Archive calls itself a non-profit that aims to preserve all human knowledge and make it accessible to anyone in the world, doing so by illegally scraping vast troves of data. It makes pirated content like e-books and scientific articles available in the form of download links via partner servers at varying speeds.

Anna’s Archive stated in a Reddit post that it provided its data to anyone who wanted it, and that anyone could torrent its data or pay for higher speed access. The platform also said that while it did not have direct dealings with Nvidia (as was alleged in the lawsuit), it had no objections in coming to an agreement with the company.

Following up on a lawsuit filed in 2024, authors Abdi Nazemian, Brian Keene, Stewart O’Nan, Andre Dubus III, and Susan Orlean alleged that Nvidia copied their works multiple times to train its language models and reached out to Anna’s Archive for data.

“NVIDIA “got the green light” to use Anna’s Archive. NVIDIA did not hesitate in using pirated books from these illicit sources of copyrighted material, regardless of the “risk” or the harm to authors like the Plaintiffs,” the authors claimed in a legal filing dated January 16.

But the price surge is rippling through consumer markets.
Counterpoint estimates that memory prices will jump 40 percent to 50 percent in the first quarter, after last year’s 50 percent surge.
Some analysts said Apple, with its scale, pricing power and deep supplier network, is better positioned to weather the memory chip price surge than its smaller rivals.
“But it isn’t immune, and may need to raise prices to pass on higher input costs.”","Global demand for smartphones, personal computers and gaming consoles is expected to shrink this year as companies from Britain’s Raspberry Pi to HP Inc raise sticker prices to offset surging memory chip costs.

The rapid build-out of artificial intelligence infrastructure by US tech firms such as OpenAI, Alphabet-owned Google and Microsoft has absorbed much of the world’s memory chip supply, pushing up prices as manufacturers prioritize components for higher-margin data centers over consumer devices.

Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron, the world’s three largest producers of memory chips, have said in recent months that they were struggling to keep up with demand as they reported rosy quarterly earnings on the back of surging prices for their semiconductors.

But the price surge is rippling through consumer markets.

Research firms IDC and Counterpoint both now expect global smartphone sales to shrink at least 2 percent this year, in a sharp reversal from their growth outlook a few months ago. That would mark the first annual decline in shipments since 2023.

The PC market is expected to shrink at least 4.9 percent in 2026, IDC estimated, after an 8.1 percent growth last year. Meanwhile, console sales are expected to fall 4.4 percent in the current year after an estimated growth of 5.8 percent in 2025, according to TrendForce.

While several firms have already raised prices, industry heavyweights Apple and Dell face a tough choice: take on the costs and sacrifice margins or pass them onto consumers at the risk of stifling demand.

“Manufacturers might absorb some costs but given the scale of the shortage, it is certainly going to show up as higher prices for consumers,” Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said.

“It is going to result in more tepid consumer device sales in 2026. It will be a challenge for these companies that are trying to sell products during a time of broader inflation.”

Pressure is being compounded by expectations that the price increases will persist, possibly into next year. Counterpoint estimates that memory prices will jump 40 percent to 50 percent in the first quarter, after last year’s 50 percent surge.

“Over the last two quarters, we’ve seen 1,000 percent price inflation in some products and pricing is continuing to rise,” said Tobey Gonnerman, president of semiconductor distributor Fusion Worldwide.

“Consumers can expect to pay significantly higher prices for laptops, mobile phones, wearables and gaming devices very soon.”

Analysts believe the impact is likely to be most pronounced for manufacturers of low- and mid-range devices, such as Chinese smartphone makers Xiaomi and TCL Technology and PC firm Lenovo.

TrendForce said last year that Dell and Lenovo were planning price hikes of as much as 20 percent early in 2026.

Shares of all Raspberry Pi, Xiaomi, Dell, HP Inc and Lenovo fell in the last three months of 2025, with Xiaomi posting the biggest drop with a 27.2 percent decline.

HP CEO Enrique Lores said in November the company would raise PC prices due to “significant” memory chip costs, while Raspberry Pi CEO called the cost surge “painful” in a December blog post announcing price increases for its devices.

The weaker demand outlook could also hamper sales at electronics-focused retailers such as Best Buy, which had already warned last year that tariff-driven price increases could dissuade potential buyers.

Apple will report earnings on January 29, while Dell is slated to report on February 26. Xiaomi usually reports in late March.

Some analysts said Apple, with its scale, pricing power and deep supplier network, is better positioned to weather the memory chip price surge than its smaller rivals.

The company typically holds prices of its flagship iPhone lineup in the US steady between its September launch events. Last year, it absorbed the hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff-related costs, instead of passing them on to customers.

“Apple is better-positioned, as it uses contract pricing (rather than more volatile spot pricing) for its purchases, securing better prices,” Morningstar analyst William Kerwin said.

The company appointed Barret Zoph to lead its efforts to sell its AI to enterprises, according to reporting from The Information, citing an internal OpenAI memo.

TechCrunch reached out to OpenAI for confirmation and more information.

Zoph returned to OpenAI last week after leaving Thinking Machine Labs, former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati’s AI startup where Zoph had served as a co-founder and CTO since October 2024.

The exact circumstances of his departure aren’t clear, with rumors swirling about whether Zoph and a few other former OpenAI employees were fired or left on their own accord, possibly with plans to return to OpenAI all along.

Zoph was previously the vice president of post-training inference at OpenAI from September 2022 to October 2024. He’s stepping into a very different position and will likely play an important role at the company as it looks to grow its enterprise business — an area where it is losing ground to competitors.

OpenAI launched its enterprise-focused ChatGPT Enterprise product in 2023 more than a year before Anthropic and multiple years before Google launched its enterprise offerings. The company claims the product has more than 5 million business users and counts companies including SoftBank, Target, and Lowe’s as customers.

But its market share is falling while its rivals are climbing.

Anthropic holds a dominant lead over its AI rivals when it comes to enterprise large language model usage. The AI research lab holds a 40% market share, according to a December report from VC firm Menlo Ventures (which, it should be noted, has invested aggressively in Anthropic). In July, the startup’s market share was estimated to be 32%.

Google’s Gemini adoption has been steadier, according to Menlo Ventures. The company released its enterprise product last fall and has seen its enterprise LLM usage market share largely stay the same, per Menlo’s findings, growing from 20% in July to 21% at the end of the year.

OpenAI on the other hand has seen its usage market share drop from 50% in 2023 to 27% at the end of 2025 — a trend that appears to concern the company. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman expressed concern specifically that Google Gemini’s growth was starting to encroach on OpenAI in an internal memo a few months ago.

Cloud software stocks have started this year where they left off in 2025: sell-off mode.

The continued downward spiral is setting the stage for a flurry of acquisitions, investors told CNBC.

The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund , which tracks cloud software, has dropped more than 8% so far this year, while the Nasdaq is slightly up. Leading software names like Salesforce , ServiceNow and Adobe are down more than 14% after badly underperforming the market a year ago.

The overriding concern is that artificial intelligence will eventually displace key pieces of the enterprise stack, as IT buyers turn to AI agents to handle tasks currently handled by software vendors, both large and small. Those fears were amplified last week when Anthropic's Claude launched an AI agent tool named Cowork that is aimed at the enterprise customer.

A senior investor at a large private equity fund who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly on the subject said the disruption in software is happening today and will force several midsized software companies to seek financing options, potentially spurring acquisitions by private equity.

Orlando Bravo, co-founder of software-focused buyout firm Thoma Bravo, is looking to buy the dip, and sees value in companies that are building their own agentic solutions to work with their existing systems.

""We're seeing just incredible buying opportunities right now,"" Bravo told CNBC's Sara Eisen in Davos on Wednesday. He said his firm is doing deals and ""will be a lot more active.""

While investors like Bravo remain bullish on software in an AI-dominated world, analyst Jackson Ader at KeyBanc sees real vulnerabilities. He conducted an analysis of the major threats facing software in August, and said then that seat-based application companies like Monday.com , Asana and Sprout Social are the most exposed. All three stocks have seen double-digit drops in 2026.

In that same note to clients, Bader said those companies aren't tied to an anchor system of record like enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and customer relationship management, or CRM, and have yet to become multiproduct platforms. Representatives from Monday, Asana and Sprout didn't respond to requests for comment.

Even companies with a wider breadth of products and more established enterprise footprint are facing significant market skepticism.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has spent months defending his company and trying to reassure investors that it is well-positioned in AI.

In Davos, Benioff told Eisen that the company's latest quarter was ""the best quarter we've ever had in our careers"" and that ""we're one of the largest cash-producing companies in the world.""

""But it's not enough,"" Benioff said, referring to the market action. ""Because if you don't produce a large language model, you're evidently not in fashion right now.""

ServiceNow is responding to the pressure by joining the potential competition. On Wednesday, the company announced a deal with OpenAI to use its models to offer AI agents to business customers.

The news didn't ease concerns. ServiceNow shares dropped for six consecutive trading days before rising on Thursday, and are down 17% in January.

HubSpot , Atlassian and Braze are having an even worse start to the year, with shares of each down more than 20%.

Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC that the recent pullback in software stocks could force certain companies to ""explore strategic alternatives"" and that any new deals that don't have a compelling AI angle won't gain much traction with investors.

In a note published in late November, Jaluria highlighted Asana, Box and DocuSign as potential acquisition targets in software. The companies didn't respond to requests for comment.

With tech earnings season kicking into high gear next week, Wall Street will start to get a clearer picture of where particular companies stand in adopting AI or getting swallowed by it.

Luria said one of the crucial questions is how quickly AI agents like Claude's Cowork go beyond developing new code and actually automate different parts of the software lifecycle. That timeline will be critical in understanding the reality of the AI threat and how soon cloud software companies might feel the pain.

The company is making moves to strengthen its pharmaceutical supply chain, boost resilience, and support advanced manufacturing capabilities.

This story is courtesy of our content partner, Thomasnet.com

Johnson & Johnson plans to construct two new production facilities in the U.S. as part of a broader strategy to localize the manufacturing of advanced medicines. These sites are part of a $55 billion commitment to domestic research, development, and technology through 2029.

Expanding the East Coast Footprint

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology company is establishing a next-generation cell therapy production site in Pennsylvania and a biologics plant in North Carolina.

J&J added that these additions complement an existing $2 billion biologics plant currently under construction in Wilson, North Carolina, which is expected to generate roughly 5,000 jobs. The organization has also recently acquired a 160,000-square-foot biopharmaceutical facility in Holly Springs to bolster its long-term production capabilities.

Strategic Pricing and Access

In coordination with federal initiatives, the healthcare firm is launching a direct-to-patient platform that aims to provide pharmaceutical products at discounted rates. According to the manufacturer, this move seeks to align domestic drug pricing more closely with costs found in other developed international markets.

The agreement also provides the company with specific exemptions from certain tariffs.

Future Infrastructure Goals

The organization aims to produce the majority of its complex therapies within the U.S. to ensure more reliable patient access, according to the company announcement. By investing heavily in advanced manufacturing technologies, the firm is transitioning away from older production models to more efficient, automated systems.

J&J added that more announcements regarding domestic production are expected before the end of the year.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

But the real story isn’t Nvidia — it’s a much smaller company quietly improving the critical technology that makes this entire revolution possible.

And judging by what I’m hearing from both Silicon Valley insiders and Wall Street veterans…

This prediction might not be bold at all:

A few years from now, you’ll wish you’d owned this stock.

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

On January 16, Oppenheimer lowered its price target on Boston Scientific to $100 from $125 with an Outperform rating. Oppenheimer is cautious on the financial optics of Boston Scientific’s $14.5 billion acquisition of Penumbra. Although the deal creates a powerhouse in the thrombectomy and neurovascular markets, analysts are questioning the valuation. At $374 per share, the high purchase multiple may hinder the company’s ability to generate a strong ROIC, leading the firm to question whether the timing was ideal for such a large-scale transaction.

Penumbra’s acquisition represents Boston Scientific’s second-largest takeover in its history and marks its re-entry into the neurovascular market.

The move is designed to broaden Boston Scientific’s cardiovascular and neurovascular portfolios. Having divested its neurovascular business to Stryker over a decade ago, Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney emphasized that the company sought a scaled platform and a strong pipeline to return to this attractive segment. Penumbra is expected to contribute ~$1.4 billion in sales for 2025, and the integration is projected to enhance Boston Scientific’s revenue and margins over the long term.

Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX) develops, manufactures, and markets medical devices for use in various interventional medical specialties. It has two segments: MedSurg and Cardiovascular.

While we acknowledge the potential of BSX as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

According to the reports, the company’s CEO, Sam Altman, has been meeting with top sovereign wealth funds and other large investors, especially in the United Arab Emirates and Abu Dhabi, to discuss the potential deal.

Valuation could be up to $830B

The talks are still in the early stages, and the amount could change, the report adds. People familiar with the discussions say OpenAI is targeting a valuation between $750 billion and $830 billion, though no final agreements have been announced.

OpenAI is known for its artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT and has spent heavily on developing large models, data centers, and computing infrastructure.

Raising new capital would help fund future technology work, including building more computing capacity and hiring engineers.

In addition to the Middle East meetings, Altman has also held separate talks with companies like Amazon about potential investments of at least $10 billion, according to earlier reports.

The completed transactions mark a major funding milestone for the structural heart company as it advances its global pivotal clinical program and scales manufacturing in preparation for potential commercialisation.

Capital raising structure and pricing

The underwritten public offering was initially announced earlier this week at US$200 million but was increased to US$230 million following the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares.

Anteris ultimately issued 40 million common shares at US$5.75 per share in the public offering, including the additional shares issued under the option.

In parallel, the company completed a private placement of 15.65 million shares to Medtronic at the same US$5.75 per share, bringing total gross proceeds from the two transactions to about US$320 million before fees and expenses.

The offering was led by Barclays, Wells Fargo Securities and Cantor as joint book-running managers, with Barrenjoey Markets acting as financial adviser to Asia-Pacific investors. Wells Fargo Securities also acted as sole placement agent for the Medtronic investment.

Funding global PARADIGM trial and manufacturing expansion

Anteris said the net proceeds from the offering and private placement, together with existing cash reserves, will support the next phase of growth and execution of its clinical strategy.

A key focus will be the ongoing recruitment and execution of the global pivotal PARADIGM trial, which is evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the DurAVR® Transcatheter Heart Valve (THV) in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The company also plans to use funds to expand manufacturing capabilities and support continued research and development activities, with remaining capital allocated to working capital and general corporate purposes.

The PARADIGM trial is a large, randomised controlled study designed to enrol around 1,000 patients globally and compare DurAVR® head-to-head against commercially available transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) systems. The trial assesses a composite endpoint including all-cause mortality, stroke and cardiovascular hospitalisation at one year.

Recruitment is already under way, with the first patients enrolled and implanted in Denmark during the December quarter of 2025.

Strategic backing from Medtronic

Management said the US$90 million investment from Medtronic provides both financial support and crucial strategic validation of Anteris’ valve technology as it moves towards regulatory approval and commercialisation.

“This strategic investment, along with our underwritten offering of common stock, represent an important milestone for our company,” said Anteris chief executive officer Wayne Paterson.

“It also provides strong validation of our program from the capital markets and a major strategic innovator,” he added. “The investment is one aspect of a collaboration that may expand into other strategic areas in the future.”

Medtronic said its investment reflects confidence in differentiated innovation within the TAVR market, particularly in technologies that aim to improve haemodynamics and valve performance within a balloon-expandable platform.

Strengthened balance sheet supports next phase

With the capital raise now completed, Anteris said it is well positioned to maintain momentum across clinical execution, manufacturing scale-up and longer-term commercial planning.

The strengthened balance sheet is expected to support expansion of the PARADIGM trial across additional geographies and advance Anteris’ goal of delivering next-generation transcatheter heart valve solutions to a growing global patient population.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI2XzAxXC9TY3JlZW5zaG90LTIwMjMtMDEtMjMtYXQtMS0xMC0wNy1QTS5qcGciLCJlZGl0cyI6eyJyZXNpemUiOnsid2lkdGgiOjEyMDAsImhlaWdodCI6NjMwLCJmaXQiOiJjb3ZlciJ9fX0=,N,,2026-01-22 20:39:23.347863

That is why Binance is now pursuing a European license and turning to Greek authorities. The company has established both a holding company there and submitted a formal application for a MiCA license. This step comes against the backdrop of intensified scrutiny by French regulators and an escalating conflict over enforcement of the Markets-in-Crypto-Assets Regulation, which has been fully applicable since December 2024. By July 1, 2026, all crypto platforms operating in the EU must provide appropriate authorization, otherwise they face exclusion from the European market.

The French banking regulator ACPR identified significant deficiencies in Binance’s risk control systems during inspections, while intensive anti-money laundering reviews are running in parallel at dozens of crypto exchanges. Of over 100 platforms registered in France, only four have received full authorization so far—a success rate of four percent. In contrast, competitors such as Kraken, Binance, KuCoin, Bybit, Coinbase, and OKX have already obtained MiCA-compliant licenses and now operate in all countries of the European Economic Area or will soon launch. Overall, more than 50 crypto companies now hold MiCA approval—Binance cannot be missing.

Stablecoins: Clear Winners and Losers

In the stablecoin sector, a clear market consolidation is emerging. While Tether, despite its market dominance, has not yet received a MiCA license and has already been removed from several EU exchanges, Circle with EURC and USDC, Société Générale-Forge with EURCV and USDCV, and Membrane Finance with EURe and eUSD have successfully cleared the regulatory hurdle. Notably, most approved stablecoins are denominated in euros, suggesting a strategic realignment of the European crypto market.

The consequences for non-compliant companies are drastic. Regulators have already imposed fines exceeding 540 million euros against crypto firms that violated regulatory requirements. After the deadline in July 2026, all tolerance ends, and companies without appropriate authorization irrevocably lose their operating license in the European Union. For Binance and other pending applicants, the clock is ticking, while already-licensed competitors continuously expand their market position.

Binance Entered 2026 Optimistically

Binance co-CEOs Yi He and Richard Teng, whose team serves approximately 300 million customers, showed greater optimism than ever in their 2026 outlook. They identified five converging forces that will drive the market from “uncertain expansion” to “secure expansion”: robust global economic growth despite trade conflicts, an impending technological revolution (AI, quantum computing, fusion), increased government liquidity provision to households and businesses, the resumption of balance sheet expansion by the Federal Reserve with further interest rate cuts, and expected regulatory clarity through the “RFIA/CLARITY Act,” which is intended to define rules for on-chain assets. This combination of macroeconomic tailwinds, monetary easing, fiscal support, and regulatory clarity makes the long-term development of on-chain assets and applications far more predictable.

The CEOs particularly emphasized that coming growth will no longer be based solely on sentiment and hype, but driven by two fundamental factors: state capital at the sovereign level and enterprise-grade applications. When nations discuss Bitcoin as a strategic reserve and on-chain assets grow from billions to trillions, it is no longer just a “bull market,” but a fundamental redesign of financial infrastructure. In this environment, Binance intends to continue functioning as a “road builder” and is increasing investment in security, compliance, and education to provide all users with safe access to the crypto world.",https://www.trendingtopics.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Binance_Leadership.png,N,,2026-01-22 22:40:00.450460

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things.","NEW YORK — Skydance-owned Paramount is again extending the tender offer window in its $77.9 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, while doubling down on a coming proxy fight.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner's merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that's still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,"" Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it's “clear our shareholders agree,"" as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner's studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner's board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix's proposed acquisition includes only Warner's studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount's bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner's current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix both fell slightly Thursday. Shares of Paramount-Skydance rose nearly 3%.

Albertsons Companies ( (ACI) ) has issued an update.

On January 22, 2026, Albertsons Companies and several subsidiaries launched a refinancing push in the bond market, announcing plans to redeem in cash the full $1.35 billion of 4.625% senior notes due 2027 and the $750 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2028, with the redemption expected to occur on February 21, 2026. To fund this move, the company priced an upsized private offering to institutional and offshore investors of $1.2 billion of new senior notes due 2032 at 5.625% and $900 million of additional 5.750% senior notes due 2034, issued at 98.5% of face value and fungible with its existing 2034 notes, with closing expected around February 2, 2026. The transaction extends Albertsons’ debt maturities and consolidates its capital structure by shifting obligations from 2027–2028 to 2032–2034, a step that could ease near-term refinancing risk and provide greater financial flexibility for operations and stakeholders, albeit at somewhat higher long-term coupon costs.

Spark’s Take on ACI Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, ACI is a Neutral.

The score is held back primarily by high leverage and weakening margins, plus bearish technicals with the stock trending below key moving averages. These are partially offset by supportive valuation (low P/E and ~3.7% yield) and a constructive earnings-call backdrop with narrowed guidance, strong digital/pharmacy execution, and continued capital return plans, albeit with notable near-term headwinds.

The stock has retreated from its recent peak, with the market's attention firmly fixed on the upcoming release of the company's Q4 2025 financial results. The central question is whether IBM can deliver on the high expectations surrounding its software division and its current artificial intelligence strategy.

High Stakes for Software and AI

The upcoming report on January 28 is viewed as a critical test for the bullish narrative supported by several analysts. Consensus estimates set a high bar:

- Earnings Per Share (EPS): Approximately $4.33, compared to $3.92 in the prior-year period.

- Total Revenue: Around $19.22 billion, up from $17.55 billion in last year's fourth quarter.

- Software Revenue: Expectations are set near $8.9 billion.

Market observers will scrutinize the software segment with particular intensity. Growth of roughly 7% year-over-year is seen as a minimum threshold to justify recent analyst optimism. A miss on this key metric could widen the apparent gap between positive analyst commentary and the stock's recent cautious price action. Furthermore, IBM's guidance for 2026, especially concerning free cash flow and margin development, will significantly influence the stock's subsequent trajectory.

Analyst Conviction Meets Market Hesitation

At the beginning of the year, several investment banks raised their targets for IBM. Jefferies upgraded the stock to ""Buy"" on January 5, establishing a price target of $360. Bank of America followed with a $335 target, while Evercore ISI set its objective at $330. The common theme is a belief in the company's intact medium-term story, even as short-term market sentiment grows more tentative.

Firms like Stifel have reaffirmed buy recommendations, projecting organic software growth of 7–8%, consistent with the division's trajectory throughout 2025. This dynamic is expected to underpin further margin expansion and growing cash flows. Despite these upward revisions, the equity has recently softened. Priced at €259.25 in European trading, the shares sit approximately 17% below their 52-week high, though they remain well above the prior year's low. The recent pullback is largely attributed to profit-taking and heightened investor restraint ahead of the earnings release.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying IBM?

Strategic Moves in Quantum Security and AI

Beyond the financials, IBM continues to advance its technological positioning. On January 22, the corporation announced a strategic partnership with Keyfactor, a provider of digital trust solutions. The collaboration aims to prepare enterprise clients for the coming era of ""post-quantum cryptography.""

The initiative involves integrating Keyfactor's automation platform with the cybersecurity expertise of IBM Consulting. This move is predicated on the expectation that future quantum computers could compromise current encryption standards. By addressing this threat early, IBM seeks to establish itself as a provider of high-margin consulting and security solutions with potential for long-term demand.

The company is also maintaining its activity in the AI arena. New collaborations with S&P Global and chip specialist Groq are designed to embed the watsonx platform more deeply into corporate workflows and accelerate the practical deployment of agentic AI applications. This strategy allows IBM to target the trend toward specialized, productivity-enhancing AI systems, moving beyond broad platform promises.

The Path Forward Post-Earnings

A convincing performance from IBM, demonstrating robust software growth and providing a confident outlook, could reframe the recent share price decline as a healthy consolidation before a potential next leg up. The January 28 report serves as the definitive event that will either validate the current analyst confidence or challenge the foundations of the optimistic investment thesis.

The Globe Pulsed Field System, which gained U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in September 2025, is capable of both high-density mapping and PFA. It features a 122-electrode spherical array designed to deliver single-shot pulmonary vein isolation (PVI).

Reviewing 1-year data from PULSAR

The FDA’s decision to approve this technology was largely based on results from the Kardium-funded PULSAR clinical trial. One-year data from PULSAR is now available in full.

The study’s authors tracked 183 patients with a mean age of 65 years old. The primary effectiveness endpoint—freedom from atrial arrhythmias or other failure modes for one year—was seen in 77.8% of patients. The primary safety event rate, meanwhile, was 0.6% due to a single stroke in a patient with severe hypertension and polycystic kidney disease. There were no device-related primary safety events.

Another key takeaway from PULSAR was the fact that PVI durability rates were quite high. PVI durability is sometimes a significant issue with PFA, but these one-year results suggest cardiologists using the Globe Pulsed Field System may have better luck with avoiding the need for redo procedures. The authors did warn that more research is still needed to determine if this durability will remain outside of a pivotal study made up of high-volume operators.

“The Globe Pulsed Field System has the potential to transform how we treat AFib by delivering durable pulmonary vein isolation with remarkable efficiency and safety,” said Vivek Reddy, MD, PULSAR principal investigator and a prominent electrophysiologist from Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, said in a statement. “These results show that this technology can make a real difference for patients, offering them better outcomes and a safer path to long‑term relief from arrhythmias.”

“The publication of the PULSAR pivotal trial results in JACC is a tremendous validation of the safety, efficacy and efficiency of the Globe System” added Kevin Chaplin, CEO of Kardium. “At Kardium, we are committed to delivering the most advanced system for the treatment of AFib.”

An outside perspective on Kardium’s PFA technology

Two electrophysiologists out of Germany—Boris Schmidt, MD, and K.R. Julian Chun, MD, both of Cardioangiologisches Centrum Bethanien in Frankfurt—wrote an editorial that accompanied the one-year PULSAR data.[2] Schmidt and Chun did not participate in the trial and have no connection to Kardium, providing readers with an outside perspective of this new technology.

Overall, Schmidt and Chun celebrated the “remarkable” one-year outcomes of this study. They pointed to the “favorable safety profile” and the “impeccable” PVI durability rates.

The two co-authors did note that the Globe Pulsed Field System almost appears to be “overengineered” at first due to its advanced features. However, they highlighted the technology’s potential to provide additional value not seen with other PFA systems.

“The most innovative potential of the global array lies in the capability to simultaneously record intracardiac electrograms from 122 distinct electrodes,” they wrote. “This will allow us to improve our understanding of electrical phenomena present during atrial fibrillation and may help to identify drivers, rotors, and other arrhythmogenic sources. Thus, it may be a unique mapping and ablation solution for patients with persistent AFib or with AFib independently from the pulmonary veins.”

The co-authors concluded by looking ahead, saying only time will tell whether this is “just another single-shot ablation tool, or if these sophisticated features will add substantial benefit.”

Spark’s Take on BK Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, BK is a Outperform.

The score is driven primarily by strong financial performance (profitability, improved leverage, and solid cash conversion despite weaker FCF growth) and supportive technical momentum (price above major moving averages with positive MACD). Earnings-call guidance and raised medium-term targets further reinforce the outlook, while valuation appears reasonable with a moderate dividend yield.

But banks' property-sector strains are easing in S&P’s base case, albeit from a high level, S&P said.

Meanwhile, China's domestic demand is likely to remain subdued and exports should slow in China.

Despite this, China’s real GDP is still headed for growth in 2026, with S&P estimating a 4% rise during the year.

“Meanwhile, given fewer interest rate cuts in 2025 than we expected, we project the banking sector's net interest margin will stabilize at 1.29% in 2027. This would be slightly higher than our previous forecast of 1.27%,” Tan wrote in the report.

Vera Rubin is already being pitched as a full-stack AI infrastructure play, with revamped GPUs, CPUs and networking chips aimed at agentic and inference workloads. Recent reports claim Nvidia has reshuffled key elements, framed as a response to AMD’s push with Instinct MI455X.

SemiAnalysis claims the Vera Rubin NVL72 spec will have 22.2 TB/s of memory bandwidth. That is a hefty leap from the numbers Nvidia showed off at GTC 2025, and it looks like a deliberate move to keep its lead in hyperscaler adoption.

The jump from roughly 13 TB/s to 22.2 TB/s does not come from fairy dust. The claim is that Nvidia is pushing HBM4 beyond standard JEDEC ratings, asking suppliers to raise pin speeds up to 11 Gbps.

Nvidia is working with a narrower eight-stack interface, so squeezing more out of pin speeds is the obvious lever to pull. AMD previously looked comfortable, leaning on 12-Hi HBM4 stacks to claim a 19.6 TB/s figure.

AMD has been talking up the Instinct MI400 family for a while, and it clearly fancies a more serious run at hyperscaler sockets this round. This all seems Nvidia’s attempt to counter this.

USA Today Network

Microsoft Corp. is planning 15 more data centers and adding 8.7 million square feet to its operation in Racine County.

The Mount Pleasant Village Plan Commission unanimously approved the site plans for Microsoft‘s latest development on Jan. 21. The approval goes to the full village board.

Microsoft has had a presence in the area since it announced it was building its first data center in 2024.

This latest proposal, if approved by officials from the Village of Mount Pleasant, marks the biggest expansion the company has made since it came to Wisconsin.

Here’s what to know about Microsoft’s latest plans for Mount Pleasant.

What is the scope of the Racine County Microsoft projects?

Microsoft’s biggest presence is in Mount Pleasant in Racine County. So far, the company has committed more than $7.3 billion in the first phase of its data center campus to support its efforts on artificial intelligence, and it’s likely to grow as the demand for data centers increases.

What’s the location of the planned Microsoft projects in Racine County?

There are two proposals being evaluated by Mount Pleasant officials. One is located on Durand Avenue and the other is on International Drive.

On Durand Avenue, the proposal is planning for up to nine data centers with additional office space, each up to 579,796 square feet. The proposal also includes a 96,000-square-foot office and storage building, and other accessory buildings.

On International Drive, the proposal is planning for six data centers and additional office space, each up to 568,103 square feet. The proposal includes a 74,000-square-foot office and storage building, and other accessory buildings.

Is there a timeline for all of this construction?

Short answer: No.

Longer answer: Microsoft has issued a statement saying “Microsoft has proposed an expansion in Mount Pleasant, with plans submitted for two additional datacenter campuses on land we purchased in 2024. These preliminary plans are the next step in our years-long development process and we look forward to sharing more about our specific plans as we go forward as we’ve done for our first two sites in May 2024 and September of 2025 respectively.”

How many buildings has Microsoft constructed in Racine County?

The company is finishing up its first data center, which consists of multiple buildings. And Microsoft is planning on breaking ground on a second data center later this year.

What guidelines must Microsoft follow while building in Mount Pleasant?

Village staff has set conditions to the proposals which include meeting architectural, lighting, parking and other modifications.

Also, Microsoft must “comply with all Racine Water Utility, Mount Pleasant Sanitary Sewer Utility, and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources rules and permissions regarding consuming and returning water to the applicable utility systems and watersheds,” the staff report says.

How many buildings does Microsoft plan to construct in Racine County?

If what Microsoft is planning comes to fruition, then nearly 20 buildings are planned for the next several years. However businesses change course regularly, even on the plot of land Microsoft is building on. It was originally intended for a giant campus for Foxconn but the original plans fell apart, giving Microsoft an opportunity to build its data centers.

And in 2025 Microsoft paused construction on its first data center for a brief period of time as the company because it was “assessing demand overall for AI and the other was assessing what kind of data center would make the most sense to build here for the second phase,” according to Brad Smith, Microsoft president.

How does the Microsoft data center square footage compare with a Walmart Supercenter?

Walmart Supercenters can range from 99,000 to 260,000 square feet. A Walmart Supercenter is about 200,000 square feet.

Each data center and office space Microsoft is proposing is more than 560,000 square feet, which is nearly three times the size of a Supercenter. With 15 proposed data centers being evaluated for Mount Pleasant, that’s easily more than two Walmart Supercenters per data center.

So doing some quick back of the envelope math, that means this project is in the size range of roughly 40 Walmart Supercenters in Mount Pleasant.",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2026/01/2026-01-21T221329Z_293753609_MT1USDAYNETWIP86222364007_FRTPIP_4_USA-TODAY-NETWORK.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 20:39:34.396106

Medtronic, a global leader in healthcare technology, announced verification study results for its investigational Nellcor™ pulse oximetry with Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor at the Society for Technology in Anesthesia (STA) Annual Meeting.

The company successfully completed pivotal clinical studies for its new Nellcor™ pulse oximetry technology. Initial data show that the investigational Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor technology, when paired with a set of market-released sensors representative of the Nellcor™ pulse oximetry sensor line, demonstrated SpO₂ accuracy better than the FDA's draft-recommended1 threshold. Additionally, pulse rate accuracy was within Nellcor™ technology acceptance limits. These results were observed in a sample inclusive of the full range of skin tones.

Pulse oximetry accuracy has historically varied across skin tones, raising concerns about technology that works for all patients. The investigational Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor technology reflects ongoing efforts of Medtronic to deliver its Nellcor™ technology's consistent SpO₂ and pulse rate accuracy across all skin tones. The company's commitment to getting it right - for every patient - is why Medtronic opened a clinical physiology lab near the Five Points neighborhood of Denver, Colorado. As a result of their extensive community outreach efforts, Medtronic has conducted its clinical studies not only with a diverse array of participants but with greater speed and frequency, leading to faster innovation.

Previously granted FDA Safer Technologies Program (STeP) designation, the company's investigational Nellcor™ pulse oximetry with Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor is currently under 510(k) review, marking an important regulatory milestone in efforts by Medtronic to bring this innovation to market.†

""Today's verification study results demonstrate accuracy across various skin tones, meeting and exceeding both the current U.S. FDA guidance and newer, more-inclusive draft guidance,"" said Dr. Randall Clark, principal investigator of the Medtronic clinical physiology lab. ""Seeing such positive outcomes with the investigational Nellcor™ pulse oximetry technology, paired with Nellcor™ sensors, marks an important step toward advancing medical-grade pulse oximetry that works for every patient.""

The verification studies were conducted in consideration of the evolving regulatory guidance1 and global standards expectations on pulse oximeters for medical purposes, which recommends accuracy testing across the full spectrum of skin tones and maintaining the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for SpO₂ accuracy within 3%, regardless of sensor type.

Key findings:

Study design: Three controlled hypoxia studies with 71 participants (ages 20-46) representing diverse skin tones across Monk Skin Tone (MST) cohorts:

• Light (MST 1-4): 32 participants (45.1%)

• Medium (MST 5-7): 19 participants (26.8%)

• Dark (MST 8-10): 20 participants (28.2%)

SpO₂ accuracy: Investigational Nellcor™ pulse oximetry with Nell-EQ™ intelligent processor paired with Nellcor™ sensors demonstrated SpO₂ RMS accuracy ranging from 1.33% (upper 95% CI: 1.48%) to 1.69% (upper 95% CI: 1.93%), outperforming the FDA draft guidance threshold of 3%.

Pulse rate accuracy: RMS accuracy remained within 2 bpm, meeting the Nellcor™ technology acceptance criterion of 3 bpm.

""Medtronic is leading the way for pulse oximetry technology that aims to deliver accuracy and inclusivity for every patient, every time,"" said Dr. Jeb Denny, chief medical officer of the Medtronic Acute Care & Monitoring business, which is part of the company's Medical Surgical Portfolio. ""Our leadership in this space reflects a commitment to advancing standards that represent all patients and empowering clinicians with world-class technology to deliver safe, equitable care for every patient, in every setting.""

The findings were presented by Medtronic at STA 2026, with Dr. David MacLeod, anesthesiologist at Duke University Hospital in North Carolina, as the healthcare professional author on the abstract.

ID9,Boston Scientific,2026-01-22 19:38:20+00:00,Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry,Moving the Needle in the Home Healthcare Manufacturing Space,Susan Shepard,,,,,https://www.mddionline.com/drug-delivery/moving-the-needle-in-the-home-healthcare-manufacturing-space,"He also serves as a Medtech consultant for Forj Medical, a contract development and manufacturing organization focused on advancing next-generation manufacturing solutions for minimally invasive and devices.
At MD&M West, he will present “The Needle Boom: Scaling Overmolded Needle Manufacturing for the At Home Care Revolution,” where he will share how manufacturers should think about scaling precision devices for a rapidly changing home healthcare landscape.
As medical devices increasingly enter the home as part of daily life, the shift is profound.
Can you briefly explain what overmolded needles are and why they are so important in the home-care sector?
Springer: Overmolded needles are more reliable and more precise than glued needles, especially when devices are used unsupervised at home.","“When you start democratizing or decentralizing technology, you have to be very thoughtful about who you partner with,” said Michael Springer, in a recent interview with MD+DI. Speaking about overmolded needles and the accelerating demand driven by GLP‑1 therapies, CGMs, and even neural devices, he offered a clear caution: “Most importantly, don’t try to do it yourself.”

Springer, a Medtech innovation and commercialization leader, works closely with startups, clinicians, and OEMs to accelerate the path to market for breakthrough technologies. He also serves as a Medtech consultant for Forj Medical, a contract development and manufacturing organization focused on advancing next-generation manufacturing solutions for minimally invasive and devices.

At MD&M West, he will present “The Needle Boom: Scaling Overmolded Needle Manufacturing for the At Home Care Revolution,” where he will share how manufacturers should think about scaling precision devices for a rapidly changing home healthcare landscape.

He believes companies can learn from startups, particularly in how they approach manufacturing differently. “You have to ask whether you’re simply good at making needles, or whether you truly understand how needles behave as systems evolve,” Springer explained. “That’s the difference between a manufacturing company and a process engineering company.”

Springer noted that this distinction is central to the work he supports at Forj Medical, where integrated design-through-manufacturing teams help customers anticipate scale from the earliest stages.

Below, Springer shares his perspective not only on overmolded needles but also on the broader shift toward scaling medical devices for home use and what it takes to do it well.

Let me start off by asking why is this topic important for medical device manufacturers?

Springer: With the rise of GLP1s, single-use consumables, and vaccination-driven injections, needles are back in focus. But this conversation goes well beyond needles. When devices move from hospital to home to consumer scale, many of the same patterns appear.

Across wearables, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), drug delivery, and implantables, signal paths and fluid paths get smaller, while tolerance for failure goes to zero. Needles are a great example of a broader trend. Manufacturing is no longer downstream—it’s part of the invention itself.

If you look at who is entering this space today, ranging from large pharma to glucose monitoring companies, it’s becoming clear that success requires far more than understanding the needle alone. Needles appear simple, but they are complex to manufacture at scale.

Take a startup like Biolinq, a company working with micron-scale sensing elements that function similarly to needles. It raises a fundamental question: what actually defines a needle? That challenge forces the industry to rethink assumptions.

Many established companies are comfortable saying, “This is how we’ve always done it.” The real question is whether that approach keeps you ahead of the curve, or already behind it.

As medical devices increasingly enter the home as part of daily life, the shift is profound. It’s comparable to moving from desktop software to mobile apps. Everything becomes decentralized.

When choosing partners, it’s not enough to ask whether they can make a needle. You also must ask whether they understand home-use environments. There are hidden physics and scaling challenges that startups are often solving first.

That’s one of the reasons I work with Forj Medical. Their global footprint and integrated engineering-to-manufacturing ecosystem is built to support devices as they move from early development into high-volume use markets.

My view is that if you’re not working with new companies pushing these boundaries, your design and manufacturing perspective becomes limited. There are many excellent engineers and manufacturers, but the pace of change demands constant challenge and strategic alignment.

Can you briefly explain what overmolded needles are and why they are so important in the home-care sector?

Springer: Overmolded needles are more reliable and more precise than glued needles, especially when devices are used unsupervised at home. Home-use devices live in the real world. A hospital is not the real world.

When you remove trained operators and controlled environments, expectations rise dramatically. If something doesn’t work at home, users lose trust quickly. They stop wearing the device or stop taking the medication.

That’s why human-centered design becomes critical. Overmolded needles support reliability, longevity, and trust. As devices continue to shrink, overmolding presents new technical challenges, but it remains essential for reliability at scale. Companies like Forj Medical, which specialize in microscale molding, electromagnetic sensing, and full system technologies, are increasingly being asked to solve these challenges earlier in the development cycle.

Who should come to your session?

Springer: Ideally, attendees leave with something that resonates and something that challenges how they think. The irony is that final decision makers often don’t attend sessions like this.

If an engineer and a manager attend together, they can continue the conversation back at their company. They can ask, “Is this real? Are we seeing this already?”

The session is for people who are allowed to take calculated risks through strategic decisions. It’s about understanding your risk profile, how you partner, and how you outsource as technology evolves. Forj Medical has been navigating these exact questions as they prepare customers for scale.

What are the main messages you would like your attendees to take away from your session?

Springer: First, it’s never too early to get help. This session is for teams who don't just want to launch a device, but they also want to survive scale.

Many of the best projects fail early, pivot, and eventually find their path. That process often requires outside experience. Asking for help is not failure—it’s a strategic decision.

Second, scale must be designed in from the beginning. Scale is where most devices fail. Working with a CDMO like Forj Medical can help teams design with scale, manufacturability, and global production in mind from day one.

If someone leaves and decides to send one thoughtful email or start one internal conversation, that’s a win.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt14ac89070d5e4751/bltdc6b4703ab050591/69727a45dbcab26a37fe04b7/Untitled_design_-_2026-01-22T142727.202.png?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-22 17:40:24.148665

Since its peak in 2017, Kraft Heinz shares have plummeted approximately 70% in value.
The timing delivers an immediate blow to newly appointed Kraft Heinz CEO Steve Cahillane, who assumed the role on January 1, 2026.
Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?
Upcoming Earnings to Intensify Scrutiny The next critical test arrives on February 11, 2026, when Kraft Heinz reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results before the market opens.","In a decisive move signaling a significant loss of confidence, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has filed to divest its entire stake in Kraft Heinz. SEC documents dated January 21 reveal the investment conglomerate plans to sell 325.4 million shares, representing over one-quarter of the company's total share capital. This exit concludes an investment held for more than a decade and comes at a moment of considerable challenge for the packaged food giant.

The decision appears to be a clear verdict on the company's future direction. Since its peak in 2017, Kraft Heinz shares have plummeted approximately 70% in value. The move by CEO Greg Abel is widely seen as tidying up the portfolio of his predecessor, Warren Buffett, who had himself labeled the 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz a mistake. Berkshire had already recorded a $3.76 billion impairment on the investment in the summer of 2025.

The timing delivers an immediate blow to newly appointed Kraft Heinz CEO Steve Cahillane, who assumed the role on January 1, 2026. He now faces a stark vote of no confidence from one of the company's most prominent shareholders. Market analysts are aligning with this skeptical view, as evidenced by recent rating adjustments:

BNP Paribas Exane downgraded the stock to ""Underperform,"" setting a price target of $22.

JPMorgan reduced its rating to ""Neutral"" with a $24 target, citing persistent volume pressure expected through the end of 2026.

Jefferies maintained a ""Hold"" but cut its price target to $23, criticizing the company's ""unclear separation strategy.""

Operational performance offers little solace. The company's U.S. retail sales declined by four percent year-over-year in the fourth quarter.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Kraft Heinz?

A Vote Against the Planned Split

Central to the current uncertainty is CEO Cahillane's strategy to split Kraft Heinz into two separate publicly traded entities in the second half of 2026. The plan would create ""Global Taste Elevation Co."" for faster-growing sauces and condiments, and ""North American Grocery Co."" for established staple brands in the U.S. market.

Observers interpret Berkshire's registered exit as a direct expression of doubt in this separation plan's value-creation potential. Rather than waiting to see the split implemented, Berkshire is choosing to cut its losses, even at current depressed share prices.

Upcoming Earnings to Intensify Scrutiny

The next critical test arrives on February 11, 2026, when Kraft Heinz reports its fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 results before the market opens. Analysts are forecasting earnings per share of $0.61 on revenue of $6.38 billion.

Until the disposal is complete, selling pressure is likely to persist. A key concern for the market is the method of Berkshire's exit. If the shares are sold on the open market rather than through a controlled secondary offering, the resulting liquidity overhang could stifle any potential for a near-term share price recovery.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2440222_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 18:41:31.444124

PhonePe and Flipkart completed their separation in December 2022, and Walmart remained the fintech’s dominant shareholder.","Tiger Global and Microsoft are primed to fully exit PhonePe, the Walmart-backed Indian payments startup that has updated its IPO filing, offering investors and market watchers a rare peek at how global investors are cashing out of the venture boom via India’s public markets.

On Wednesday, PhonePe updated its IPO prospectus (PDF), detailing how many shares are up for sale. Tiger Global and Microsoft are offering up their full stakes in the company, while Walmart is choosing to retain its majority stake and selling up to 45.9 million shares (about 9% of the company).

Up to 50.66 million shares are up for sale, marking a liquidity event for existing shareholders.

PhonePe was valued at about $12 billion in a January 2023 funding round, though it is targeting a market capitalization of around $15 billion in the IPO, which could raise up to $1.5 billion, sources familiar with the matter told TechCrunch.

The offer does not include any founder sell-downs, and the prospectus shows the share sale is being driven by existing investors rather than by PhonePe’s management.

Founded in 2015 by Sameer Nigam, Rahul Chari, and Burzin Engineer and acquired by e-commerce giant Flipkart a year later, PhonePe has emerged as one of India’s most successful fintechs. The company started with digital payments and has expanded into stockbroking and mutual fund investments, and even offers an Android app store as an alternative to the Google Play Store.

PhonePe is the largest player in India’s digital payments market, leading the UPI ecosystem in transaction volumes and staying ahead of Google Pay. In December 2025, it processed about 9.81 billion transactions worth roughly ₹13.6 trillion (about $148.6 billion), compared with Google Pay’s 7.50 billion transactions worth about ₹9.6 trillion (around $104.5 billion), according to the latest NPCI data.

The company was spun off after Flipkart decided on a partial split in December 2020. PhonePe and Flipkart completed their separation in December 2022, and Walmart remained the fintech’s dominant shareholder.

In the six months ended September 2025, PhonePe’s revenue from operations rose 22% to ₹39.19 billion (about $427.79 million) from a year earlier, while its loss widened to ₹14.44 billion (around $157.70 million) from ₹12.03 billion (about $131.34 million), per the prospectus.","https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1206129405.jpg?resize=1200,784",N,,2026-01-22 14:42:23.798834

Training Safety Through Data and Simulation Modern AI-driven safety systems learn from exponentially more driving scenarios than any human could experience in a lifetime.
By generating synthetic scenarios that represent these rare situations, AI systems can learn appropriate responses during development without putting people at risk.","AI-powered driver assistance technologies are becoming standard equipment, fundamentally changing how vehicle safety is assessed and validated.

The recent recognition of the Mercedes-Benz CLA as Euro NCAP’s Best Performer of 2025 underscores this shift, as the vehicle combines traditional passive safety features with NVIDIA DRIVE AV software to achieve the highest overall safety score of the year.

​​“When Euro NCAP assesses vehicle safety, it evaluates both passive and active systems — achieving a perfect score requires a state-of-the-art advanced driver assistance system,” said Ola Källenius, CEO of the Mercedes-Benz Group. “This milestone represents the culmination of five years of collaboration between Mercedes-Benz and NVIDIA to enhance real-world safety and deliver tangible value to customers.”

Euro NCAP (European New Car Assessment Programme) has for nearly 30 years served as Europe’s independent vehicle safety authority, backed by European governments, motoring organizations and consumer groups.

Euro NCAP evaluates vehicles across four categories that reflect real-world safety. For AI-powered driver assistance, the most relevant are the “Vulnerable Road User” and “Safety Assist” categories, which assess technologies designed to help prevent crashes — including automatic emergency braking, lane-keeping support and speed assistance.

Only vehicles achieving five-star ratings with standard equipment qualify for “Best in Class” recognition, with winners determined by weighted scores across all categories. In 2025, Euro NCAP tested a record 49 models.

Safety Comes First: How DRIVE AV Is Built for Trust

Safety ratings like Euro NCAP are increasingly recognizing vehicles that combine strong passive protection with advanced active safety performance. As AI becomes central to driving, the benchmark for the “safest” car will increasingly be defined not only by how well a vehicle handles a crash, but how effectively it helps prevent one.

The Mercedes-Benz CLA is built with NVIDIA DRIVE AV, a dual-stack architecture that’s designed to help automakers deliver systems that aren’t only intelligent, but predictable, verifiable and resilient in the real world. The architecture pairs an AI-driven end-to-end driving system with a parallel classical safety stack to provide redundancy across AV sensing, planning and execution.

The CLA is also built on the NVIDIA DRIVE Hyperion architecture, which incorporates sensor diversity and hardware redundancy into the vehicle’s overall design.

At the heart of this approach is NVIDIA Halos — a comprehensive safety system spanning hardware, software, tools, development processes and certification support. Halos delivers a structured safety foundation for developing automated driving and other AI capabilities while staying anchored to robust guardrails, redundancy and fault tolerance.

Third-party certification and assessments are also important to build trust:

TÜV SÜD granted the ISO 21434 Cybersecurity Process certification to NVIDIA for its automotive system-on-a-chip, platform and software engineering processes. Additionally, NVIDIA DriveOS 6.0 conforms to ISO 26262 Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) D standards.

TÜV Rheinland performed an independent United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) safety assessment of NVIDIA DRIVE AV related to safety requirements for complex electronic systems, which NVIDIA successfully completed.

NVIDIA recently released its Alpamayo family of open AI models, simulation tools and datasets — which enables AVs to navigate even rare, “long-tail” events they haven’t been trained on by breaking the scenario down into smaller steps, reasoning through multiple possible actions and ultimately selecting the safest one. Using these models with the parallel classical safety stack in the NVIDIA DRIVE AV dual-stack architecture provides an additional layer of protection to keep vehicles operating within safe boundaries.

Training Safety Through Data and Simulation

Modern AI-driven safety systems learn from exponentially more driving scenarios than any human could experience in a lifetime. NVIDIA’s cloud-to-car development approach transforms real-world data into billions of simulated miles using NVIDIA DGX systems for neural network training, the NVIDIA Omniverse and Cosmos platforms for simulation, and NVIDIA DRIVE AGX for in-vehicle computing.

This methodology addresses a critical challenge in safety validation: training AI to navigate rare but high-risk edge cases that are too dangerous — or too infrequent — to test reliably in the real world. By generating synthetic scenarios that represent these rare situations, AI systems can learn appropriate responses during development without putting people at risk.

The CLA’s recognition is more than a single model earning a top rating — it reflects a broader shift in what safety means in the modern vehicle, where trusted crash protection is paired with AI-enabled driver assistance designed to help avoid accidents in the first place.",https://blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/mb-cla-euro-ncap-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:59:18.969484

In a note ahead of IBM’s earnings report, due on January 28, the firm reiterated a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock. “We are bullish on IBM's ability to deliver upward estimate revisions and accelerating software growth in calendar year 2026,” the analysts wrote.

Jefferies pointed to Red Hat as a primary driver of the outlook, noting that bookings growth accelerated to roughly 20% and that key subscription products such as OpenShift and Ansible are showing accelerating demand. The analysts highlighted OpenShift’s annual recurring revenue of about $1.8 billion, along with about 40% bookings growth, supported by $400 million in virtualization-related bookings and an additional $700 million pipeline. They wrote that these indicators, along with broader Red Hat momentum, could help drive stronger software revenue.

The note also cited momentum in automation and data as supporting factors, noting that HCP delivered its highest bookings quarter in history in the third quarter, supported by IBM’s global distribution channels, and is expected to approach 20% growth this year.

Jefferies added that the Data and AI portfolio, initially expected to grow in the mid-to-high single digits, could benefit from the CFLT transaction through acquired revenue and a higher growth profile.

A rebound in mainframe software spending could further support software revenue, the firm added. The analysts noted that transaction processing software underperformed for much of 2025 as mainframe clients prioritized hardware spend early in the cycle.

Given the strength in shipped MIPS, which they wrote were more than 100 percent higher versus the z16 cycle, Jefferies believes that transaction processing revenue should benefit as shipped MIPS turn into installed MIPS.

On IBM’s Q4 results, Jefferies noted that sentiment has improved as IBM’s software growth rose from mid-single digits to high-single digits, but execution has been inconsistent and the company has slightly missed Street estimates in each of the last four quarters.

They noted that Street estimates are modeling 10.2% year-over-year software growth in the fourth quarter, alongside 10% infrastructure growth and 6% consulting growth, with total revenue growth expected at 9.5% and a free cash flow margin of 36%.

Jefferies also discussed valuation, noting that IBM trades at 26 times CY27 GAAP EPS, compared with 27 times for Oracle and 23 times for Microsoft. They have a $360 price target on IBM, which traded hands at about $297 on Thursday afternoon.

The analysts believe that the multiple could expand if software execution becomes more consistent and the software business mix rises, with software expected to represent nearly half of revenue by 2027.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI2XzAxXC8yMDI0LTEwLTI0LTEyLTU4LTMxLWI0ZGVlMWNmOTU0ZTU0NzcwZjA1ZjlkMjU0OGU4YzhkLmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2026-01-22 14:42:07.242786

Managing GLP-1 spending has become a strategy of its own, according to one NFP leader, who advocated for collaboration among CHROs, CFOs, and corporate boards to address this issue.
A host of pharmaceutical manufacturers have agreed to sell their medications at a lower price point, including Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which make GLP-1 drugs.
“I think GLP-1s will always be a specific, individual topic,” apart from pharmacy benefits more broadly, he explained.
Managing complex challenges surrounding pharmacy costs may benefit from cross-collaboration among HR and finance teams, as well as corporate boards, Conway suggested.","Employers grew more concerned about the high cost of pharmaceutical drugs last year, even as the White House rolled out a series of policies intended to lower prices of some popular medications.

Nearly three-quarters of employers said they were moderately, very, or extremely concerned about pharmacy costs being “unsustainable” in 2025, according to a recent report from NFP, a benefits consultancy that’s part of Aon. That’s up from 67% who expressed moderate to extreme concern about pharmacy costs in 2024.

The growing focus on pharmacy spending comes as employer health costs are projected to rise more than 9% this year, driven in part by coverage of costly GLP-1 medications for weight loss. Managing GLP-1 spending has become a strategy of its own, according to one NFP leader, who advocated for collaboration among CHROs, CFOs, and corporate boards to address this issue.

How HR is seeking to control prescription drug spend. President Donald Trump campaigned on overhauling the US healthcare system and has rolled out a number of policies intended to lower drug prices since taking office in 2024. A host of pharmaceutical manufacturers have agreed to sell their medications at a lower price point, including Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which make GLP-1 drugs.

The hope is that these deals will eventually bring relief to the employer-sponsored insurance market. As of October 2025, though, GLP-1 diabetes and weight loss medications were still cited as the top driver of prescription drug spending among health benefits decision-makers surveyed by NFP, with 51% identifying them as such, up from 44% in 2024.

Despite their high cost, GLP-1s are gaining ground as a potential lever for talent attraction and retention. Indeed, 29% of workers told NFP they would switch jobs to gain GLP-1 coverage.

Still, decisions about coverage vary “dramatically” from one employer to the next, said Nick Conway, NFP’s president of Rx Solutions. Those who are covering the drugs are commonly turning to “bolt-on solutions” to help manage costs, he said. Such solutions may be offered by a pharmacy benefit manager or a third party, and may help employers evaluate whether GLP-1s are appropriate for their workers, as well as manage utilization.

Other employers may forgo working with their PBM entirely and turn to point solution vendors to help manage GLP-1s separately from other prescription drugs, he said.

Whatever approach HR teams land on, it looks likely that GLP-1s will require unique strategic thinking for the foreseeable future, Conway said. “I think GLP-1s will always be a specific, individual topic,” apart from pharmacy benefits more broadly, he explained.

Managing complex challenges surrounding pharmacy costs may benefit from cross-collaboration among HR and finance teams, as well as corporate boards, Conway suggested. “All this disruption is creating a more robust conversation at our employer clients to bring in either the chief financial officer of the business, or the board of the business, into these decisions,” he said.","https://morningbrew.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,quality=70,format=auto/https://storage.morningbrew.com/image/2026-01-22/image-8d1ec49515058dfebb728eb57c8fded728c81ac9-2409x1606-jpg/Moneyinhealthcare-Highcosthealthconcept",N,,2026-01-22 17:58:24.670397

Lisa Su — Chair and Chief Executive Officer

Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. So we delivered very strong second quarter results, with revenue exceeding the midpoint of guidance as higher EPYC and Ryzen processor sales more than offset headwinds from export controls that impacted Instinct sales. We set records for both EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales, reflecting the broad-based demand for our differentiated, high-performance data center, PC, and embedded processors.

Second quarter revenue increased 32% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion, and we delivered over $1 billion in free cash flow. Excluding the $800 million inventory write-down related to data center AI export controls, gross margin was 54%, marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion led by a richer product mix.

Turning to the segments, Data Center segment revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. We saw robust demand across our EPYC portfolio to power cloud and enterprise workloads and increasingly for emerging AI use cases. In particular, adoption of Agentic AI is creating additional demand for general-purpose compute infrastructure, as customers quickly realize that each token generated by a GPU triggers multiple CPU-intensive tasks. Against this backdrop, 5th Gen EPYC Turin shipments ramped significantly, and we had sustained demand for our prior generation EPYC processors. As a result, we set records for both cloud and enterprise CPU sales and delivered our 33rd consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gains.

In cloud, adoption expanded with the largest hyperscalers as they deployed EPYC to power more of their mission-critical infrastructure, services, and public cloud products. More than 100 new AMD-powered cloud instances launched in the quarter, including multiple Turin instances from Google and Oracle Cloud that deliver up to twice the performance of our previous generation, which were already the industry’s highest-performing offerings. There are now nearly 1,200 EPYC cloud instances available globally, as providers continue expanding both the breadth and regional availability of their AMD offerings. This continued expansion is accelerating enterprise adoption of EPYC in the cloud, with deployments growing significantly from the prior quarter as we closed large wins with dozens of large aerospace, streaming, financial services, retail, and energy companies.

EPYC adoption also grew with telecom customers, as providers modernize their infrastructure for next-generation networks. For example, KDDI announced plans to deploy EPYC processors to power its 5G virtualized network, and Nokia selected EPYC for its cloud platform used by service providers to build, deploy, and manage core network functions.

Turning to enterprise on-prem adoption, HPE, Dell, Lenovo and Supermicro launched 28 new Turin platforms in the quarter that delivered leadership performance, efficiency, and TCO across a wide range of enterprise workloads. EPYC enterprise deployments grew significantly from the prior quarter, supported by new wins with large technology, automotive, manufacturing, financial services, and public sector customers. To extend our momentum with SMB and hosted IT service customers, we launched the EPYC 4005 series that combine enterprise-grade performance and features in cost-optimized platforms, purpose-built for smaller-scale deployments.

Turning to HPC, AMD now powers more than one-third of the world’s fastest supercomputers, including El Capitan and Frontier, which retained the number one and number two spots on the latest top 500 list. We also powered 12 of the top 20 systems on the Green500, highlighting the performance per watt advantages of EPYC and Instinct for large-scale deployments. Looking ahead, we remain bullish on our server CPU business, driven by durable tailwinds, including growing demand for cloud and on-prem compute, sustained share gains, and the growing investments in general-purpose infrastructure required to enable AI.

Turning to our data center AI business, revenue declined year-over-year as US export restrictions effectively eliminated MI308 sales to China, and we began transitioning to our next-generation MI350 series accelerators. We made solid progress with MI300 and MI325 in the quarter, closing new wins and expanding adoption with Tier1 customers, next-generation AI cloud providers, and end users. Today, seven of the top 10 model builders and AI companies use Instinct, underscoring the performance and TCO advantages of our data center AI solutions. We launched our Instinct MI350 series with industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity and broad adoption across hyperscalers, AI companies, and OEMs.

From a competitive standpoint, MI355 matches or exceeds B200 in critical training and inference workloads and delivers comparable performance to GB200 for key workloads at significantly lower cost and complexity. For at-scale inferencing, MI355 delivers up to 40% more tokens per dollar, providing leadership performance and clear TCO advantages. With the MI350 series, we’re also expanding our system-level capabilities to support deployments powered by AMD CPUs, GPUs, and NICs. As one example, Oracle is building a 27,000-plus node AI cluster combining MI355 accelerators, 5th Gen EPYC Turin CPUs, and Pollara 400 SmartNICs. We began volume production of the MI350 series ahead of schedule in June, and expect a steep production ramp in the second half of the year to support large-scale production deployments with multiple customers.

Our Sovereign AI engagements accelerated in the quarter, as governments around the world adopt AMD technology to build secure AI infrastructure and advance their economies. As one example, we announced a multi-billion dollar collaboration with UMaine to build AI infrastructure powered entirely on AMD CPUs, GPUs, and software. Initial deployments are underway in key regions, with quarterly expansions planned over the coming years. In addition, we have more than 40 active engagements globally and see significant opportunities to power an increasingly larger portion of national computing centers and sovereign AI initiatives.

On the AI software front, we made significant progress this quarter increasing the performance, improving the usability, and expanding the adoption of ROCm. We announced ROCm 7 with major upgrades across every layer of the stack, delivering more than 3x higher inferencing and training performance, compared to our prior generation, and adding support for large-scale training, distributed inference, and lower precision data types. The deepened developer engagement, we introduced nightly ROCm builds and expanded access to instant compute infrastructure, including launching our first Developer Cloud that provides pre-configured containers for instant access to AMD GPUs. We also expanded native support for ROCm across key frameworks including vLLM and SGLang, enabling frontier models like Llama 4, Gemma 3, and DeepSeek R1 to launch with Day 0 AMD support. To accelerate enterprise adoption, we introduced ROCm Enterprise AI, a full-stack platform that integrates seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure and includes everything needed for an enterprise to deploy, manage, and scale AI across their business.

Looking ahead, the development of our next-generation MI400 series is progressing rapidly. These are the most advanced GPUs we have ever built, with up to 40 petaflops of FP4 AI performance and 50% more memory, memory bandwidth, and scale out throughput than the competition. With the MI400 series, we’re bringing together everything we’ve learned across silicon, software, and systems to deliver Helios, a full-stack, rack-scale AI platform. Helios is purpose-built for the most demanding AI workloads, with each rack connecting up to 72 GPUs that can operate as a single massive AI accelerator. Helios is expected to deliver up to a 10x generational performance increase for the most advanced frontier models, and we believe it will be the highest performance AI system in the world when it launches. MI400 series development is progressing well towards our planned launch in 2026, with significant interest in large-scale deployments from multiple high-profile customers.

To accelerate our development, we have invested significantly to expand our AI software and hardware capabilities, both organically and inorganically with a number of acquisitions and strategic investments. We strengthened our software stack last quarter with the addition of the Brium and Lamini teams, building on our acquisitions of Nod.ai, Mipsology, and Silo AI. On the hardware side, we added a world-class rack and data center scale design team in the second quarter with our acquisition of ZT Systems. The ZT team has integrated seamlessly, and they are actively engaging with multiple customers to accelerate deployments of our Helios solutions at scale. We also announced last quarter that Sanmina intends to acquire ZT’ US-based manufacturing business, becoming our lead partner for AI rack manufacturing.

Turning to the AI regulatory environment, earlier this quarter, we were notified by the Department of Commerce that it is moving forward with the review of our license applications to export MI308 to China. We appreciate the focus the Trump administration is placing on ensuring that the US technology remains central to global AI infrastructure, and we expect to resume MI308 shipments as licenses are approved, subject to end customer demand and supply chain readiness. As our licenses are still under review, we are not including any MI308 revenue in our third quarter guidance. Despite that, we expect Instinct revenue to grow year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by the ramp of MI350 at multiple customers.

In Client and Gaming, segment revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $3.6 billion, driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our semi-custom game console SoCs and Radeon GPUs. Client revenue increased 67% year-over-year to $2.5 billion led by record desktop CPU sales. Demand for our latest generation Ryzen 9000 series was strong, especially for our differentiated X3D processors. We delivered record desktop channel CPU sales, as Ryzen processors consistently topped the best-selling CPU lists at major global e-tailers throughout the quarter. We also expanded our Zen 5 desktop portfolio with the launch of our latest Threadripper processors that feature up to 96 cores and deliver up to double the performance of the competition in many popular content creation and design workloads.

In mobile, demand for AMD-powered notebooks was strong, with sell-out growing by a large double-digit percentage year-over-year. We drove a richer mix of higher ASP mobile parts year-over-year as we expanded our share in the premium notebook segment, where our Ryzen AI 300 CPUs deliver leadership, performance, and value for both general-purpose and AI workloads.

In commercial PCs, Ryzen adoption accelerated as OEM consumption increased more than 25% year-over-year. We saw strong sell-through for AMD commercial notebooks with Lenovo and HP, and a significant uptick in Dell sales as they ramp availability of their AMD commercial portfolio. We also closed new enterprise wins with Forbes 2000 pharma, tech, automotive, financial services, aerospace, and healthcare companies. We expect to continue growing our commercial client share based on the strength of our product portfolio and expanded breadth of OEM offerings.

Looking more broadly, we remain confident we can continue growing client processor revenue ahead of the market over the coming quarters, driven by increased adoption of our desktop and notebook products, growing commercial momentum, and a richer product mix.

In gaming, revenue increased 73% year-over-year to $1.1 billion. Semi-custom revenue increased by a large double-digit percentage year-over-year, as console inventories normalized and our customers began preparing for the holiday season. We announced a new multiyear collaboration with Microsoft for custom chips that will power the next-generation of Xbox devices, including consoles, PCs, and handhelds. We also deepened our collaboration with Sony through Project Amethyst, a co-engineering program that will use machine learning to power the next wave of immersive gaming experiences.

In PC gaming, demand for our latest generation Radeon 9000 series GPUs was very strong, with desktop GPUs sell-through accelerating in the quarter, as demand outpaced supply. We launched the Radeon 9600 XT, extending the performance advantages of RDNA 4 to mainstream gamers and delivering a significant uplift in gaming performance, including more than double the ray tracing of our prior generation. As part of our end-to-end AI strategy, we introduced the Radeon AI PRO R9700 GPU for local inferencing, model fine-tuning, and other data-intensive workloads. The R9700 features more memory, full ROCm support, and multi-GPU scalability, enabling advanced AI development and deployment directly on the desktop.

Turning to our embedded segment, revenue decreased 4% year-over-year to $824 million. Demand continues recovering gradually with sell-through in the second quarter picking up, as strength in most markets was offset by a few pockets of softness in inventory reduction actions, largely with industrial customers. We expanded our embedded portfolio with the first production shipments of Spartan UltraScale+ FPGAs that deliver leadership performance and advanced security for cost-sensitive, low-power applications. Adoption of our Versal adaptive SoCs continues expanding in high-end applications, including next-generation Robotaxi platforms developed by Bosch in Europe, where Versal serves as a high-performance controller enabling real-time processing, security, and encryption in fully electric automated vehicles.

Looking ahead, we expect improving demand in the test and measurement, communications, and aerospace markets will drive a return to sequential growth in the second half of 2025. Longer-term design win momentum continues to build tracking ahead of this point last year and putting us on pace to surpass the record $14 billion in design wins we achieved in 2024.

In summary, demand is very strong across our product portfolio, and we are well-positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year, led by the steep ramp of MI350 series accelerators and ongoing EPYC and Ryzen share gains. Our server and PC CPU businesses are accelerating, driven by growing demand for high-performance compute, sustained share gains, the strength of our product portfolio, and expanded go-to-market investments. Our embedded in gaming businesses are returning to growth and are well-positioned for long-term success, supported by strong design win momentum. And in AI, we are seeing strong adoption of our MI350 series and ROCm 7, as we deliver leadership performance and TCO advantages across a broader range of workloads and ramp deployments with an expanded set of cloud and enterprise customers.

Looking ahead, we see a clear path to scaling our AI business to tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. We are very excited about our next-generation MI400 series, which is another giant step forward on our roadmap and has been designed to deliver leadership performance at the chip, server, and rack levels. Customer interest for the MI400 series is very strong, and we are actively engaging with an expanding set of customers to support large-scale deployments in 2026. We are in the early stages of an industry-wide AI transformation that will drive a step function increase in compute demand across all of our markets, positioning us for significant revenue and earnings growth over the coming years.

Now, I’d like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second quarter results. Jean?

Jean Hu — Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer

Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. We are pleased with our strong second quarter financial results. We delivered record revenue of $7.7 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, up 32% year-over-year, reflecting strong momentum across our business. Record sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and higher semi-custom shipment more than offset the impact of the US export controls, restricting MI308 sales to China. Revenue increased 3% sequentially due to strong growth in the Client and Gaming segment, partially offset by the data center revenue decrease due to export controls.

Gross margin was 43%, down 10 points from 53% a year ago. The decrease was due to the $800 million inventory and related charges associated with the export restrictions. Excluding this charge, non-GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%.

Operating expenses were approximately $2.4 billion, an increase of 32% year-over-year, as we continue to invest aggressively in go-to-market activities for revenue growth and in R&D to capitalize on significant future AI expansion opportunities. Operating income was $897 million, representing a 12% operating margin compared to $1.3 billion, or 22% a year ago. The decline was primarily due to the inventory and related charges. Taxes, interest expense, and other totaled $126 million.

For the second quarter of 2025, diluted earnings per share were $0.48, compared to $0.69 a year ago. The inventory and related charges reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.43.

Now turning to our reportable segment, starting with the Data Center. Data Center segment revenue was $3.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, driven by strong EPYC CPU revenue and the share gains across both cloud and enterprise customers. On a sequential basis, Data Center revenue decreased 12% due to the impact of the export controls on MI308. The Data Center segment operating loss was $155 million, compared to operating income of $743 million a year ago, or 26% of revenue. The loss was primarily due to the inventory and related charges.

Client and Gaming segment revenue was $3.6 billion, up 69% year-over-year and 20% sequentially, driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our PC and console gaming products. In the Client business, revenue was a record of $2.5 billion, up 67% year-over-year, driven by record sales of our Ryzen desktop CPUs and richer product mix. Gaming revenue rose to $1.1 billion, up 73% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for our newly launched gaming GPUs and higher semi-custom revenue as inventory has now normalized and customers prepare for the holiday season.

Client and Gaming segment operating income was $767 million, or 21% of revenue, compared to $166 million, or 8% a year ago, driven by richer client product mix and operating leverage on higher revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $824 million, down 4% year-over-year and flat sequentially, as embedded and market demand remains mixed. Embedded segment operating income was $275 million, or 33% of revenue, compared to $345 million, or 40% a year ago. The decline in operating income was primarily due to product mix.

Before I review the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the acquisition of ZT Systems early in the second quarter. As we had announced our intent to divest ZT manufacturing business, the financial results of the ZT manufacturing business are reported separately in our financial statements as discontinued operations and are excluded from our non-GAAP financials. Subsequently, in May, we entered into an agreement with the Sanmina Corporation to sell the ZT manufacturing business for $3 billion in cash and stock, inclusive of contingent payments. The transaction is expected to close near the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.

Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, during the quarter, we generated $1.5 billion in cash from operating activities of continuing operations, and free cash flow was a record of $1.2 billion. We returned $478 million to shareholders through share repurchases, resulting in $1.2 billion in share repurchases for the first half of 2025. In May, our Board of Directors approved an additional $6 billion authorization exiting the quarter, we have $9.5 billion remaining under our share repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.9 billion. Our long-term debt was $3.2 billion. During the quarter, we paid down $950 million of commercial paper used to finance the ZT Systems’ acquisition cost.

Now turning to our third quarter 2025 outlook, please note that our third quarter outlook does not include any revenue from AMD Instinct MI308 shipment to China, as our license applications are currently under review by US government. For the third quarter of 2025, we expect revenue to be approximately $8.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately 28% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Client and Gaming and Data Center segments. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow by approximately 13%, driven by strong double-digit growth in the Data Center segment with the ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 series GPU products. Modest growth in our Client and Gaming segment, with client revenue increasing and gaming revenue to be flattish. And our Embedded segment revenue to return to growth.

In addition, we expect third quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, and we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.55 billion. We expect net interest and other expenses to be, again, over approximately $10 million. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares.

In closing, we executed very well in the first half of the year, delivering record revenue and building strong momentum for growth in the second half. The strategic investment we are making positioned us to capitalize on the expanding AI opportunities across all our end markets, driving sustainable long-term revenue growth and earnings expansion for compelling value creation.

With that, I’ll turn it back to Matt for the Q&A session.

Matthew Ramsay — Vice President of Financial Strategy and Investor Relations

Operator, will you please pull the audience for questions? Thank you.

Questions and Answers:

Operator

Yes, thank you, Matt. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Thomas O’Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.

Thomas O’Malley

Hey, thank you for taking my questions, and I appreciate it. Lisa, I want to start on the Client business. So you had previously laid out a second half outlook that was roughly flattish with the first half, as you were kind of protecting against some pull-forward. So first, do you think that your Q2 results included some pull-forwards and the second half should still be flattish? And longer-term, after the Intel commentary regarding 18A, maybe what that means is a knee jerk reaction just right away for AMD longer-term in terms share and ASPs?

Lisa Su

Sure, Tom, thanks for the question. So first of all, our Client and Gaming segment, and particularly our Client business, just performed very well in the first half of the year, I think if you look at the entire first half, it was up 68% year-over-year. I think if you look underneath that, what we’re seeing is strength in every part of our Client business. So we saw very strong sales in our desktop channel area. We have a leadership product there, best gaming GPUs with our X3D GPUs. We’ve had strong rise in AI adoption as well in the first half of the year, we see that in sell-through. And in addition, we’ve had strong enterprise sell-through as we brought that forward.

So to your question of how much is pull-forward, we don’t think a whole lot of that is. We actually — when we look at the sell-through patterns, the end user consumption is actually quite strong for client in terms of going into the second half of the year. As we said in our Q3 guide, the primary driver of our Q3 guide is a very strong data center driven by MI350 ramping. We are expecting some growth in the Client business, so I wouldn’t say it’ll be flat to the first half, but it won’t be — we’re planning for it to be a little bit less than seasonal, just given some of the uncertainties out there. But the Client business is performing extremely well for us. We believe we are gaining share in all the right places. So if you look at the numbers in the first quarter, and it’ll show through in the second quarter as well, a lot of the uplift in revenue is in ASPs. And that is basically, we’re selling up the stack on the strength of our portfolio.

And I think we’re still quite underrepresented in the enterprise portion of the business. That is where we have increased our go-to-market resources and focus. And we’re seeing nice traction there, especially with the portfolios that we have from HP and Lenovo in enterprise PCs. And now we’re adding Dell as well as it’s ramping here, started in the second quarter, we’ll ramp more in the second half of the year. So I think all of those are tailwinds for our Client business, beyond the second half of ’25, but really, into the next number of quarters, as we think about the portfolio and the opportunities for us.

Thomas O’Malley

Super helpful. And then secondly, I was hopeful you could provide us a little more color on China. So the guide doesn’t include MI308. But perhaps you could comment on when you get approval if the supply chain is ready, what’s currently in inventory, and maybe compare what you think the contribution will look like versus the $700 million in Q2 and the $800 million for the second half you spoke about in April?

Lisa Su

Sure, Tom. So, yeah, let me answer some of the questions on China. I’m sure that there are some questions. Look, we’re very pleased with the progress that’s been made with the administration over the last couple of months. We’ve been working very closely with the administration. I think the focus here on ensuring that US technology gets utilized throughout the world is something that we certainly support and very much want to contribute to. China is an important market for us. Given the timing of licenses, we have a number of licenses that are under review now. We are working with the Department of Commerce to get those reviewed. We do expect that once those licenses are approved, we will start MI308 shipments.

In terms of the supply chain, most of our inventory was not in finished goods, so it was work in process, and it will take us a couple of quarters to run through that. The exact timing of revenue and contribution will depend a bit on when those are — when the licenses are actually granted. But overall, I think this is a better position than we were 90 days ago. And we certainly view China as a market that we would like to service with MI308. And we’re working closely with the administration to do that.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.

Vivek Arya

Thank you for taking my question. If we look into 2026, right, that’s when I think the Sovereign opportunity could get quite meaningful for AMD. What is the right way to size that? What does this JV structure mean with some of the contracts that you have signed? And would you consider this incremental to the kind of growth rate that you’re seeing with your current MI business, or would this be instead of? So just if you could give us a way to size, what is that incremental opportunity from a Sovereign customers when it comes to ’26, Lisa? Is it dependent on MI400, right? In which case, it might be more backup dated, etc. So just some ways to think about Sovereign for AMD next year.

Lisa Su

Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, we’re really excited about the overall AI opportunity for us with MI355 and the MI400 series as we go through the back half of this year and into 2026. I think it’s — there’s a very large opportunity with, let’s call it hyperscalers, some of the leading AI companies, as well as Sovereign. I think Sovereign is additive to that, for sure. From the standpoint of what to expect, there are also some regulatory things that need to be worked through on the Sovereign side. But again, we’re working closely with the administration as they go through the various regulatory decisions that need to be made.

But from my perspective, I think the fact that countries want their own Sovereign computing capability is very, very clear. I think we see that all over the world. The HUMAIN opportunity that you’re referring to that we announced with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I think is a great example of where together with their ambitions, our technology, I think you heard from Tareq that was — he was at our event saying that would start with MI355, that we would expect that that would continue on. I think what’s attractive about our offering is our open ecosystem. And I think that really resonates with the Sovereign community. But to your original question, I think it’s an additive opportunity, and it’s one that we believe will continue to be very important for us going forward with both MI355 as well as the MI400 series.

Vivek Arya

Got it. And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about gross margins for your MI product. So I understand in the early days, right, it has been dilutive. What kind of sales level is required for it to start becoming additive to margins? And let’s say if I fast-forward to Q4 and assume that your Q4 sales are growing year-over-year roughly the same rate as Q3 sales, should we expect gross margins kind of to stay at these Q3 levels, or are there other plus/minus drivers we should think about in terms of gross margins as you go into Q4? Thank you.

Jean Hu

Yeah, Vivek, thank you for the question. The gross margin of our MI product, we said it’s a little bit below corporate average. I think at this point, our priority is really to address the large, fast-growing revenue opportunities we have and provide customers a better TCO to really expand our presence in the marketplace. I think the way to think about our gross margin, there are different dynamics, right, different customers, different generations. But also, our operations team has been continuing to really drive operational efficiency to improve our MI family’s gross margin. That has been ongoing. So it’s not necessarily really tied to, okay, the revenue level each quarter, but you should think about it as a trend in the longer term. It should improve continually going forward.

Overall, the way I think about it is gross margin dollars, right, this is one of the fastest-growing market opportunities. For any financial metrics, gross margin dollars is what we try to grab as much as we can. Hopefully, that helped your question.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.

Timothy Arcuri

Thanks a lot. Lisa, so my question is on data center GPU. You did say that June is up year-over-year. So it sounds like it’s maybe a little more than $1 billion. And you use words like “strong ramp” into the back half of the year. Can you give us just any color on what that means? Can you get to, say, $7 billion for the year? And can you give us some maybe milepost on what you’re assuming for Q3? That would be great.

Lisa Su

Yeah, thanks, Tim, for the question. I think what we said in the prepared remarks is that, we are seeing a strong ramp from Q2 into Q3. MI355, we actually started production in June, so we had some shipments in sort of in the month of June, but it really is ramping as we go through this quarter in the third quarter. So in terms of guideposts, we said it would grow year-on-year from last year. And that I think is a strong ramp. And then we would expect it to grow into the fourth quarter as well.

The demand, I should say, what we’re seeing from customers is, I think really positive around MI355. Sort of the way I would contrast it with maybe the MI300 ramp, I think MI300 started with perhaps some smaller deployments. I think what we’re seeing with MI355 is very competitive versus the B200, GB200 family of products. I think there’s a strong desire to really use us at scale. MI355 is very strong for inferencing. We’re also working with a number of customers on training. And this is also an opportunity for us to build into the MI400 series as we go into 2026. So we’re bullish on MI355 and where the AI opportunity is for us. And I think we’re right on track to what we expected to be as we were going through the development of the roadmap.

Timothy Arcuri

Thanks a lot. And then, Lisa, just on that point, also, you did talk about a new Developer Cloud. So, obviously, you’re beginning to lease back some of the capacity that you’re selling into the clouds and the NIO clouds. Is that going to be a material portion of the revenue you’re going to recognize for MI355 in the back half of the year? Can you just talk about that and maybe how to think about how much demand that’s going to stimulate and what the ultimate goal is for that cloud? Thanks.

Lisa Su

Yeah. So there are a couple of things in that question. So let me answer. So the Developer Cloud is simply we want to make it super easy for developers to get on AMD Instinct GPUs. One could say — again, if we look back at the MI300 family, we were very focused on the largest hyperscalers and the largest customers. But there’s a lot of interest in our GPUs across a number of customers who just wanted easier access. So by ensuring that Developer Cloud is there, that it has, ready-to-deploy containers, you can run training and inference easily, you don’t necessarily have to make longer-term commitments, I think that’s the purpose of the Developer Cloud.

I don’t think it adds meaningfully to revenue in the second half of the year, but it certainly adds to customers getting experience with AMD. I think the larger revenue opportunities for us are really with large customer adoption as they ramp to larger deployments. And we’re very actively trying to get those deployments up and running as soon as possible.

One of the things, just as a reminder, that the MI355 is — given that it’s a similar infrastructure to MI300, we actually think it’s going to ramp very quickly and very well for customers. And I think that’s one of the attractive portions of it as well.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.

Ross Seymore

Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, I want to go back to the Instinct side of things, and the MI355 ramp. Looks like the second half is going to ramp really significantly. You said it’s going to be up year-over-year in the third quarter. I believe a quarter ago, you said roughly the same thing in the MI308 is out of both numbers. So that shouldn’t really matter and I guess it would be upside. But I just wondered how have things changed from a quarter ago as far as the MI350 family adoption, especially because you launched a little bit early? Is the growth a little bit more than you would have expected a quarter ago, about the same, or a little worse? Just any sort of color on that would be helpful.

Lisa Su

Yeah, Ross, thanks for the question. I think the main thing I would say is, I think the adoption is a bit faster than we might have expected. Again, whenever you launch a product, we want to make sure that we go through the full validation and all of that with our customers. I think there’s a lot of interest, broad-based interest in MI355. And so, I feel like over the last 90 days, I think we’ve had significant sort of new customer interest and that’s certainly positive.

I will say —

Ross Seymore

I guess —

Lisa Su

Oh, I’m sorry, Ross, I was just going to add, the — our engagements are — I think the other piece is, I think there’s also a lot of excitement around MI400 and what we can do with the Helios rack. And so, there are a number of customers who, based on the strong roadmap that we’re showing, want to get familiar and really work with us earlier in the life cycle, which, I think is again, positive.

Ross Seymore

Great. Thank you for that. I guess is my follow-up, an earlier question you talked about a little bit below seasonality in the second half of the year for your Client business. It seems like there’s just — I don’t even know if seasonality is a framework that matters. But how are you thinking about that for the second half as a whole for Client? And then Gaming, it was just up a huge amount sequentially. In the second quarter, you described a little bit of what you’re expecting there. But how do you think about seasonality for the second half in its entirety in the Gaming side as well?

Lisa Su

Yeah. Let me try, and then Jean might add if you want a little bit more color. So the way to think about it is, we do expect some growth — sequential growth in client as we go into the third quarter. I would say, single-digit-type growth. We continue to see good traction for our products in that portfolio. On the Gaming side, I would call it flattish to Q2. And we’re coming off of such a strong Q2 that I think flattish is actually to be expected.

As we go into the fourth quarter, the dynamics that we would see is, we would see that the console business would actually be down substantially. So think about it as down strong double digits. The customers usually build for the holiday season, sort of before that and then that will be completed by the fourth quarter. So we would expect as the Client and Gaming segment that the segment would probably be down in the fourth quarter.

So hopefully, that helps. Jean, did you want to add to that?

Jean Hu

No, I think you covered it.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.

Joshua Buchalter

Hey, guys, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about lead times on your — on the Instinct family, both for the MI350 family and MI400. As you move into larger cluster sizes, which it sounds like you’re doing at least with Oracle on 350, and then endeavor to do more so on 400, how much visibility and lead time do you need from your customers? Because I would imagine the lead time for your parts is measured in months. But on the infrastructure side, in particular for the larger-scale deployments, those things are measured in years at this point. So maybe you could speak to the visibility specifically on the 400. Thank you.

Lisa Su

Yes, sure, Josh. So, yes, I mean, our lead times are long, given all of the processing steps that we have to go through. Think about it as somewhere between eight, nine months, that type of thing. We have a very, very strong supply chain. We’ve been preparing for these ramps of both MI350 series and MI400 series and that preparation is ongoing. So we feel like we have a very strong supply chain there.

In terms of visibility with customers, we’re absolutely working with customers very closely on near-term MI350 series deployments, getting those deployments up as quickly as possible. Again, one of the things about the MI350 series that is good is that, it can go into existing data centers, given the — just given the platform that is — that it is in. So we have been certainly working with our customers there.

And then for the MI400 series, there are lots and lots of details in sort of full rack scale design implementation and we’re actively working with the largest customers right now on just ensuring that our Helios rack is fully compatible with their data center build out as we go into 2026. So that visibility is important. I think that co-development, co-engineering is important as we get into the rack scale architecture. And the ZT team that we’ve brought in has been extremely, extremely helpful in terms of both internal platform build out, as well as ensuring that we’re working closely with our customers on their data center needs.

Joshua Buchalter

Thank you for that, Lisa. And maybe for Jean, I wanted to follow up on Vivek’s question earlier on gross margins. So if we add back the charges in 2Q and then your gross margin implied in the guidance is roughly flat sequentially, and that’s despite what’s implied to be data center GPUs up meaningfully, sequentially. It doesn’t seem like consoles falling off in the third quarter. I mean, can you maybe talk to the underlying drivers of how you’re able to keep the flat gross margins despite what sounds like still margin-dilutive data center GPUs up significantly within the mix? Thank you.

Jean Hu

Yeah, Josh, thanks for the question. Yeah, we are guiding our Q3 gross margin around the 54% and Q2, you’re right, excluding the $800 million charge. It was close to 54%. I think the Gaming business actually is quite high. So the mix actually is unfavorable. But we do have some tailwinds we have been really driving. First is, we have been expanding our server business, which has really nice gross margin. And on the Client business side, we are expanding the commercial PC business. That really helps us to drive the gross margin up. In addition, we do have a really strong operational team. They are driving the gross margin improvement just from an operational efficiency perspective across the board. So overall, our objective is to continue to improve gross margin despite MI350 very strong ramp in Q3, we are able to continue to drive the margin up.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

Joseph Moore

Great. Thank you. You used this language before of the kind of tens of billions opportunity around MI400. Can you talk about the time frame when that might occur, and not to pin you down too much, and what would help you get to that level sooner rather than later? Should we think of that 2027 realistic outcome that you could be looking at $20 billion-plus? Just a little bit more color on that tens of billions comment.

Lisa Su

Yeah. Maybe without being specific, Joe, I can give you sort of the way I look at it and back to this notion of, are we incrementally more confident? I think we’re seeing a lot of positive signs in our AI customer adoption. I think the strength of the MI350 series, the very positive feedback that we’re getting on MI400 from customers, the work that we’re doing in terms of ensuring that we are fully ready for large-scale deployments of not just inference but training. I think when we get to tens of billions of dollars, we’re talking about significant gigawatt-scale type deployments. And those would be important for us to get there. And we’re certainly, I think, engaged with all the right customers that can enable that type of ramp. But I won’t necessarily speculate on the exact time other than to say certainly, that would be our set of aspirations.

Joseph Moore

Great, that’s helpful. Thank you. And then, as these workloads evolve, I mean, you’ve sort of talked about inference and training as different opportunities for AMD. Are you seeing those start to come together? It seems like with inference, there’s — the reasoning models are requiring much higher complexity. Is rack scale more important to the inference market than you thought it might be? Just any color around how that complexity of inference is impacting you guys.

Lisa Su

Yeah, I think that’s absolutely true, Joe. I think with the proliferation of models, I think what we’re seeing is, GPUs continue to be very — sort of the computing of choice as you think about all the models that are out there. And then as you go into distributed inference and some of the newer techniques, we are seeing the importance of the scale-up and scale-out architecture, which we are investing in. But I think the overarching thing is, I think we have a very competitive roadmap across the next couple of generations. I think that has now gotten strong customer validation. We’re getting a lot of feedback from customers on where they would like to see us continue to add more resources and add more focus. And so, that is very helpful. And the key is to be a full-scale solution provider for these large customer deployments and that’s what we’re working on.

And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.

Aaron Rakers

Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I do have a follow-up as well. I guess the first question is, when we look at the data center guide, Jean, you alluded to double-digit sequential growth. Obviously, the MI355 series kind of ramping, I’m curious, how could we conceptualize what you’re expecting in the server side, and where do you think your market share is today in traditional enterprise servers outside of cloud?

Jean Hu

Yeah, I think when you look at our Data Center business, we do have a strong double-digit growth. Both server and the MI, both sides are growing sequentially. Of course, MI ramp is the most significant one. As far as server market share, we do think we continue to drive the market share up compared to Q1. Third-party has not published report yet, but we feel really good about the Q2 market share increase versus Q1.

Lisa Su

And Aaron, if I just add to that, one of the things that — it’s important for people to understand is, in some of the cloud capex numbers that have come out that have been quite positive, that is not only a GPU statement, but there’s actually significant CPU capex in there as well. We’ve started to see more robust forecasts going out a number of quarters on the server CPU side, because all of that AI content really requires traditional CPUs as well. And so, we’re very bullish on the opportunity in servers. I think the team has really executed extremely well. I mean, if you look at our portfolio now, Turin Genoa, our very well-adopted broadening workloads. Enterprise adoption is also increasing. And so, I think all of those are positive for the server opportunity in the second half of ’25, as well as going into ’26 and beyond.

Aaron Rakers

Yeah. And then as a follow-up, I’m kind of thinking about the China, the MI308 opportunity. When we do see a license, I think you alluded to this earlier, it’s going to take a little bit of time to ramp and get the supply chain to satisfy the demand. But I’m curious, the $800 million write-down that you had taken, is there no kind of finished inventory there? Does that come back? Do you have any reversal aspects of that once a license gets approved?

Jean Hu

Let me start first, then Lisa can add. The first on the $800 million, majority of them are WIPs. We really don’t have on-the-shelf finished good we can ship immediately. So we do need to take time if we get a license.

Operator

And the next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.

CJ Muse

Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Lisa, I was hoping you could level-set us on the Instinct ramp into 2026. How are you thinking about the timing of the handoff 350 to 400? How are you thinking about Helios contributions? And I guess very importantly, from a customer contribution perspective, how you might see that evolve from traditional hyperscalers to perhaps more Sovereign and NIO cloud within the mix?

Lisa Su

Sure, CJ. So certainly, as second half this year, it’s all about MI355 ramp into first half of next year, I think the MI400 series development is right on track. The development of the Helios platform is also right on track. We would expect significant revenue contribution from Helios in 2026. And then relative to the contribution of the various things, hyperscalers, sort of some of the — versus NIO clouds versus Sovereign, I think it’s a little early to really talk about the different pieces other than to say, you would expect that hyperscalers and let’s call it NIO clouds that would be working for other large AI natives, maybe significant pieces of the initial ramp. And then Sovereign may come a little bit later in time, just given sort of the timing of when different build-outs would happen. So hopefully, that gives you some color, CJ.

CJ Muse

Yeah, very helpful. And then, Jean, I guess a question for you, with the sale of ZT for $3 million in cash and stock, and you only have $3 billion of debt outstanding, how are you thinking about the use of proceeds? Is there saving for a rainy day or bolt-on acquisitions, perhaps more aggressive share buyback? How are you thinking about it today?

Jean Hu

Yeah, thanks for the question. Our business model actually generates a lot of free cash flow. As you see in Q2, free cash flow generation was $1.2 billion. So if we close the ZT sale, and we’ll get more cash, overall, our capital allocation principle continues to be the first phase investing, especially with the tremendous AI opportunities ahead of us. And then we will continue to return cash to shareholders. We did a $1.2 billion repurchase in the first half of the year. We are committed to continue to return cash to shareholders through share repurchase.

Matthew Ramsay

Operator, I think we have time for one more caller, please.

Operator

Okay. The final question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.

Ben Reitzes

Hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. I wanted to clarify a little bit on the $1 billion increase in sequential sales. It would seem like it’s coming from GPUs, primarily. I was wondering if you could back that. And that’s with nothing in China. And if the answer to the prior question that GPUs are over $1 billion, that kind of puts you at a $2 billion run rate. And I was just wondering if that was accurate in terms of thinking. And then I have just a very quick follow-up. Thanks.

Jean Hu

Hi, Ben, thanks for the question. If you look at the sequential revenue increase, as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, we see data center strong double-digit increase, which includes both GPU and CPU. But GPU definitely drives the largest incremental amount increase. We also mentioned the client actually is going to increase sequentially. In addition, the Embedded business will return to sequential growth. So multiple businesses contributed to sequential increase, but the majority of increase really driven by MI355′ strong ramp.

Ben Reitzes

Okay. Great. And then if indeed that gets you pretty close to a couple billion dollars, if the MI300 comes in, do you see it at the same run rate that you exited and then you have the ability to get at that $800 million run rate right away or do you think it’ll take several quarters to ramp when you get the license? Thanks.

Lisa Su

Yeah, Ben, it will take some time to ramp, just given — particularly, today, I mean, we’re sitting already in early August, so I don’t think you would see a lot of it in Q3. But certainly, as licenses would be approved, we would schedule that, and it would take a little while to ramp.

Matthew Ramsay

All right, operator. Thank you very much. We appreciate everybody that joined the call today. And we just like to end the call now. Thank you.

Riyadh Air launches cargo brand

Riyadh Air, Saudi Arabia’s new national carrier, has launched its cargo operations under the brand name Riyadh Cargo, marking its formal entry into the global air cargo market and the activation of belly-hold cargo services across its wide-body fleet.

Riyadh Cargo will leverage the substantial capacity available on Riyadh Air’s orderbook of more than 120 wide-body aircraft to move goods efficiently and reliably, strengthening connectivity between global markets. The cargo operation is being developed through a deliberate, phased strategy designed to build a scalable and fully integrated business anchored at the airline’s Riyadh hub. Growth will be aligned closely with network expansion and the airline’s increasing operational maturity.

The cargo division has already begun operations as part of the carrier’s wider ‘Pathway to Perfect’ process and has demonstrated early operational momentum on the Riyadh–London Heathrow route. During this initial phase, Riyadh Cargo has successfully transported significant volumes across a diverse range of commodities, including garments and textiles, fresh flowers, seafood, tea and coffee. These early movements highlight the operation’s ability to manage time-sensitive, perishable and high-value shipments with consistency and reliability.

Pravin Singh, Global Head of Cargo at Riyadh Air, said the cargo business has been designed with a long-term vision from the outset. “Riyadh Cargo has been built with a clear focus on operational discipline, reliability, and long-term scalability,” he said. “Launching within a live environment allows us to test, learn, and continuously refine how we operate, while delivering real value to our customers from the get-go. The launch of the brand is a foundational step in building a cargo business that grows alongside our network expansion and supports Saudi Arabia’s broader logistics ambitions.”

Walmart Keeps in Control

Walmart will cut its stake in PhonePe by about 12% to around 60%. Other stakeholders, Tiger Global and tech titan Microsoft (MSFT), plan to exit their stakes.

Walmart, which holds an about 72% stake in PhonePe, is selling nearly 46 million shares in the IPO. The three firms will together sell around 50.7 million shares in the offering. PhonePe will not issue any new shares in the IPO and will not receive proceeds from the sale. It aims to list by mid-2026, according to a Reuters report.

The company, founded in 2015, is the leading payments platform on India’s popular unified payments interface (UPI), commanding more than 45% market share by transaction volume, as of December 2025.

However, PhonePe’s loss widened to 14.44 billion rupees ($157.80 million) in the six-month period ended September 30, from 12.03 billion rupees a year ago, while revenue rose about 22% to 39.18 billion rupees, the filing showed.

Its main competitors in India are Google (GOOGL) Pay and Paytm.

Crucial Expansion Plans

PhonePe has more than 657 million registered users and offers payment solutions to over 47 million merchants.

PhonePe had been part of Flipkart, an India-based e-commerce group that is also majority-owned by Walmart. Both have been a crucial part of Walmart’s international expansion plans in the world’s most populous country.

PhonePe’s IPO plan comes amid buoyant Indian primary markets, where fundraising hit a record high in 2025. India ranked as the world’s second-largest primary market in 2025 after the United States, with 367 IPOs raising $21.8 billion, according to LSEG-compiled data.

NEW YORK (AP) — Skydance-owned Paramount is again extending the tender offer window in its $77.9 billion hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, while doubling down on a coming proxy fight.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that’s still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,” Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it’s “clear our shareholders agree,” as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner’s studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner’s board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount’s bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix both fell slightly Thursday. Shares of Paramount-Skydance rose nearly 3%.",https://www.pottsmerc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Warner_Bros_11300.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-22 16:42:02.929145

Wired and The Wall Street Journal earlier reported some details of the exits of Mr. Zoph, Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz from Thinking Machines.
Thinking Machines amassed $2 billion from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, the chip makers Nvidia and AMD, and others.
In the ensuing months, Thinking Machines struggled to raise new funding, for which it was seeking a valuation of $50 billion.","On Jan. 12, Mira Murati, the chief executive and co-founder of the artificial intelligence start-up Thinking Machines Lab, was asked by Sam Schoenholz, a leading researcher at the company, to join a meeting.

Ms. Murati sat down with Mr. Schoenholz and two other founders, Barret Zoph and Luke Metz. All four had worked together at OpenAI, the ChatGPT maker, where Ms. Murati had been the chief technology officer, before the creation of Thinking Machines in February.

But in less than a year, Mr. Zoph, Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz had become deeply unhappy with the start-up’s direction. Thinking Machines lagged OpenAI and other rivals in releasing products, and was struggling to raise new funding at an eye-popping $50 billion valuation. The men had urged Ms. Murati to strike a deal — Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had discussed buying Thinking Machines, and Ms. Murati had developed closer ties with the chief executive of Anthropic, a leading A.I. company — but no transaction had resulted.

At the meeting, the men lobbied for Mr. Zoph, Thinking Machines’ chief technology officer, to oversee decisions about the company’s technical direction. They threatened to leave if changes were not made, four people with knowledge of the discussion said.

Ms. Murati balked. She told Mr. Zoph that he was already the chief technology officer and should just do his job.

Two days later, Ms. Murati, 37, fired Mr. Zoph, 32, who had been talking behind her back since October with OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, about returning to the company. OpenAI immediately rehired Mr. Zoph, along with Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz.

Another nine or so of Thinking Machines’ roughly 100 employees have decamped to OpenAI or have received offers to join the company, three people with knowledge of the situation said. Meta has also made offers worth hundreds of millions of dollars to some of the start-up’s employees, two people said.

The defections have set off furious mudslinging, as each side has cranked up its spin machine to portray its version of the story. A relationship that Mr. Zoph had with a Thinking Machines employee became public, and Ms. Murati — who posted a public message about having “parted ways” with Mr. Zoph — has faced questions over her reasons for firing him and the state of the company.

The turmoil at Thinking Machines, one of the highest-profile A.I. start-ups, is the latest episode in the perpetual soap opera that is the artificial intelligence industry, where young billionaires clash over professional and personal relationships as they vie for money, power and supremacy in the field. Occasionally, the drama spills into public view, riveting Silicon Valley.

“I am reminded of this line from ‘Anna Karenina’: ‘All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,’” said Venky Ganesan, a partner at the investment firm Menlo Ventures. “Happy companies require many things to go right simultaneously. You only need one or two things to go wrong to have an unhappy company.""

Wired and The Wall Street Journal earlier reported some details of the exits of Mr. Zoph, Mr. Metz and Mr. Schoenholz from Thinking Machines.

The A.I. industry, a relatively small world of technology specialists and wealthy executives and investors, has long dealt with internecine feuds. Elon Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, clashed with Mr. Altman over the company’s direction in 2018 and left. Mr. Musk has since sued Mr. Altman and OpenAI, accusing them of breaching the company’s founding contract by putting commercial interests ahead of the public good.

(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)

In 2023, several OpenAI board members ousted Mr. Altman, saying they did not trust him to build A.I. for the benefit of humanity. Ms. Murati played a part in Mr. Altman’s firing and briefly took over as OpenAI’s chief executive.

Her timing was fortuitous. The A.I. industry was booming, and Ms. Murati had the name recognition in tech circles to gather funding for a new venture. Thinking Machines amassed $2 billion from the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, the chip makers Nvidia and AMD, and others.

The financing, announced in July, valued Thinking Machines at $12 billion, though it had not released a product and Ms. Murati was tight-lipped about what the start-up would produce. In a social media post at the time, she said the start-up “exists to empower humanity.”

The company opened an office in San Francisco’s Mission District, a few blocks from OpenAI’s headquarters, and spared no expense on interior decorating. The in-house gym included “squat racks” for weight lifting, with iron barbells branded with “Thinking Machines” in bold white typeface.

Last summer, Mr. Zoph approached Ms. Murati about his relationship with a colleague who was not an A.I. researcher and who eventually left the company, three people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Zoph continued in his role.

Around then, Meta executives reached out to Ms. Murati about potentially buying Thinking Machines, five people with knowledge of the conversations said. Mr. Zoph wanted to sell, but Ms. Murati preferred to remain independent and viewed the discussions with Meta as not serious.

In October, Thinking Machines released a product that helps developers adjust A.I. models to better perform specific tasks. Offered to businesses and software developers over the internet, the product was similar to technologies from Google, Amazon and Microsoft.

Mr. Tulloch also pushed Ms. Murati to sell Thinking Machines, two people familiar with the matter said. No deal materialized, and he left for Meta, which was heavily recruiting A.I. talent. The talks between Meta and Thinking Machines were reported earlier by The Verge.

In the ensuing months, Thinking Machines struggled to raise new funding, for which it was seeking a valuation of $50 billion. Some of its investors have privately worried about whether the start-up has a path forward as an independent company, two people familiar with the discussions said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/20/multimedia/THINKING-MACHINES-OPENAI-zfjv/THINKING-MACHINES-OPENAI-zfjv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 13:42:25.162954

Yes, that means CPUs. The last time Nvidia tried its hand at non-graphics PC processors, it ended in a lasting failure. Times have changed, and now it’s ripe for Nvidia to once again enter the market for all-in Team Green machines. It could mark the moment when ARM-based PCs really take off, if only the ongoing RAM crisis wasn’t making this one of the worst moments for PCs in general.

Sure, Nvidia didn’t have much to say at CES 2026; however, a report from Digitimes (read via machine translation) claims that the company could have a notebook-ready chip early this year. This would be an ARM-based chip potentially akin to the Grace Blackwell SoC (system on a chip) found inside Nvidia’s DGX Spark AI-centric computers. Tom’s Hardware reported last week the same chip appeared in a shipping manifest for a sample Dell 16 Premium laptop.

This supposed “N1X” chip could be followed by several differently spec’ed CPUs later in the year. If Digitimes’ supply chain sources are correct, we could even hear about a supposed “N2” chip as a follow-up before the end of 2026. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang previously hinted at the N1 last year in a press conference with Intel’s new chief, Lip-Bu Tan. That’s where Nvidia promised to craft chips with Intel that would somehow combine the best of both companies. We’ll have to see how well that partnership goes if both chipmakers are actively competing with each other.

There’s a mountain of competition for Nvidia

Nvidia will be late to the party no matter what it does. Qualcomm, the other big ARM-based chipmaker for lightweight laptops, already has its Snapdragon X2 Elite Extreme chip promising huge gains in graphics capability. Qualcomm also shared details on its Snapdragon X2 Plus chip at CES 2026. Nvidia’s only consumer-end announcements were tied to DLSS upscaler updates, more multi-frame gen for games, and computer vision technology for autonomous vehicles.

The N1X could still be a powerful chip, though with all the delays, Nvidia may be better off waiting to showcase a more powerful N2 chip if it wants to compete with Intel’s Core Ultra Series 3 laptop chips or whatever gamer-specific APU (accelerated processing unit) AMD has been cooking up. Of course, we’d be interested in a laptop that has RTX 50-series Blackwell capabilities without the need for a power-sucking discrete GPU.

Microsoft promises all ARM-based PCs will be good for gaming

On Wednesday, Microsoft declared that it was making its Xbox app work natively on “all” ARM-based PCs. That’s interesting rhetoric considering how much of its messaging previously centered on “Snapdragon on PCs” or “Copilot+.” Xbox now claims that 85% of Xbox apps are compatible on ARM, though that’s mostly thanks to improvements to the Windows Prism emulator. Prism can take x86 native apps and help them run by recreating that separate CPU microarchitecture as software. In a recent update, Microsoft added support for AVX and AVX2 extensions to the x86 instruction set. These are especially important for games that rely on AVX for tasks like video encoders and physics engines.

Microsoft is also advertising that ARM-based PCs will share compatibility with Epic Anti-Cheat. Lack of EAC support is why some of these computers and other Linux-based systems like Valve’s Steam Deck struggle to run games like the ever-popular Fortnite. We’re two years into Microsoft’s big ARM-based PC push, and Qualcomm is adamant it no longer needs to talk about compatibility issues. The chipmaker launched a Qualcomm Control Panel app last year that’s supposed to act as a launcher for various games and programs, ensuring they work natively or on emulators when necessary.",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2026/01/nVidia-GeForce-5080-11-e1740161107263-1200x675.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 13:00:08.210261

Lines, also known as MOL, one of Japan’s biggest shipping companies, announced its first carbon removal results under its long-term environmental plan. This move marks a real step beyond reducing emissions. MOL aims to reach net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 under its Environmental Vision 2.2.

Shipping emissions are hard to cut, so removal methods help tackle the remaining CO₂. MOL’s actions also reflect the global growth of the carbon removal market. Companies and countries are investing more in solutions that take CO₂ out of the air for long-term storage. This trend is rising as climate targets push industries to go beyond emission cuts.

DAC, Ocean Capture & Rocks: A Trio of MOL’s First Carbon Removal

In fiscal 2024, MOL announced its first verified carbon removal achievements. This progress builds on its Environmental Vision 2.2 strategy. The shipping giant secured measurable removal commitments using several technologies.

In its LinkedIn post, the company notes:

“In FY2024, MOL reported credits equivalent to 2,000 tons of CO₂ emissions- marking the company’s first tangible achievement in CDR… As MOL continues to diversify its CDR portfolio, it remains committed to finding and scaling the most effective solutions- both natural and technological- to advance toward a decarbonized future.”

MOL partnered with Climeworks, a leading Direct Air Capture (DAC) company. Through this partnership, the company agreed to procure 13,400 tonnes of CO₂ removal by 2030 using Climeworks’ DAC systems.

MOL is the first shipping company globally to set up this type of DAC purchase. DAC pulls CO₂ directly from the air and stores it permanently.

MOL also signed an offtake agreement for 30,000 tonnes of carbon removal credits from Captura’s Direct Ocean Capture technology. This method removes CO₂ from seawater, which draws CO₂ from the air over time.

In addition, MOL made a deal with Alt Carbon for 10,000 tonnes of carbon removal credits. These credits come from enhanced rock weathering in India. Enhanced weathering helps pull CO₂ from the air into minerals in soil, a type of removal considered higher quality and more durable. This deal is the first of its kind between a Japanese shipping company and an Indian climate tech firm.

MOL is also buying enhanced rock weathering removal credits through another multiyear offtake. This brings added diversity to its removal portfolio. These deals help the company support different removal paths rather than relying on a single method.

Why Shipping Needs Removals

The global shipping industry carries about 90% of traded goods by volume. It also produces roughly 3% of global CO₂ emissions. If trade grows, emissions could rise unless action is taken.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) aims for shipping emissions to drop. The targets are: 20-30% reduction by 2030, 70-80% by 2040, and net-zero by 2050, all compared to 2008 levels.

Even with cleaner fuels like ammonia or hydrogen, some emissions will remain hard to avoid. Energy efficiency and fuel switches help, but they cannot remove all CO₂ from long ocean voyages. Carbon removal fills this gap. It helps shipping companies offset their leftover emissions while future fuel solutions scale up.

RELATED: Shipping Toward Net Zero: Maritime Turns to Green Hydrogen and Ammonia

MOL’s Environmental Vision 2.2 plan aims to remove 2.2 million tonnes of CO₂ by 2030. This goal covers all its removal initiatives. This creates demand for early‑stage removal solutions and helps scale emerging technologies.

Partnerships on the Horizon: Forests, Carbon Credits, and Cross-Industry Moves

MOL’s carbon removal work includes broader moves with partners and industry players. The company is supporting carbon credits to cut emissions and expand negative emissions. All credits are third-party certified and independently verified to ensure quality and impact.

In January 2025, MOL and Marubeni Corporation started Marubeni MOL Forests Co. This joint venture will create, trade, and retire nature‑based carbon credits. Its first project aims to plant around 10,000 hectares of new forest in India. This will generate credits from afforestation and reforestation. These forests will start producing removals around 2028. Nature‑based solutions help store carbon while boosting biodiversity and soil quality.

Also, MOL signed a deal with ITOCHU Corporation. This agreement aims to promote environmental attribute certificates. These certificates help cut Scope 3 emissions in transportation. This work is the first Japanese model linking shipping and aviation in environmental certificate use. Scope 3 emissions come from supply chains and end‑use.

Another related program is the NX‑GREEN Ocean Program by Nippon Express, launched in February 2025. It uses carbon inset certificates tied to low‑carbon shipping by MOL vessels. These certificates help companies reduce their Scope 3 freight emissions. The program shows how removal and decarbonization can work together for supply chains.

Together, these partnerships show MOL’s expanding role. The company is connecting technical and natural removal solutions with marine decarbonization and cross‑industry climate efforts.

Riding the Carbon Market Wave

The global carbon removal market is growing fast. Corporations and governments are investing more in long-lasting removal methods. These include DAC, ocean capture, enhanced weathering, and nature-based solutions. This growth matches scientific calls for big removals to keep warming under 1.5°C.

MOL is helping to expand the removal market by investing in multiple technologies. A joint venture for a NextGen CDR Facility, including MOL and other buyers, aims for over 1 million tonnes of certified removals by 2025. These projects include DAC and biomass removal with long-term storage. Early demand helps drive down costs over time and encourages more technological development.

Shipping companies are also investing in emission reduction technologies. These include more efficient ship designs, alternative fuels, and onboard carbon capture systems.

Global shipping firms continue to align with the IMO’s decarbonization goals through technology upgrades, fuel changes, and climate partnerships. This includes work on hull design, logistics efficiency, and fuel alternatives such as ammonia and hydrogen. Those efforts reduce emissions intensity and support long-term climate targets.

Challenges Ahead: Cost, Permanence, and MRV

Despite progress, carbon removal faces challenges.

High Costs and Early Stage Technology: Direct Air Capture and ocean capture remain expensive and are still early in deployment, making them less appealing than traditional emission reductions.

Need for Strong MRV and Certification: Measurement, Reporting, and Verification systems must stay robust to ensure credits reflect real and lasting CO₂ removal. Independent certification is critical for market trust.

Nature-Based Risks: Forest and land projects require careful planning. Carbon storage can be reversed if forests burn, degrade, or are mismanaged. High-quality MRV standards help protect long-term carbon value.

Sailing Toward 2050: MOL’s Vision for Net-Zero Maritime

Despite challenges, experts say removals will be necessary for sectors that cannot eliminate emissions by 2050. Shipping, aviation, and heavy industry will likely cut emissions and use durable removals to meet climate goals.

For MOL, investing in removal markets, partnerships, and strong MRV frameworks positions the company as a leader in maritime decarbonization. The first results under Environmental Vision 2.2 show how shipping firms can add new climate solutions to their sustainability plans.

By partnering with DAC, ocean capture, and enhanced weathering technologies, and by investing in nature-based solutions, MOL is expanding its climate action beyond traditional emission cuts.

As shipping and corporate climate planning evolve, carbon removal will remain a key part of long-term strategies. MOL’s progress with Environmental Vision 2.2 shows how companies can blend technology, nature, and market forces to achieve bold climate goals.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shutterstock_1705906225.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 14:42:11.572861

Fortunately, I had saved partial copies of some conversations and materials, but large parts of my work were lost forever.
However, my case reveals a fundamental weakness: these tools were not developed with academic standards of reliability and accountability in mind.
If a single click can irrevocably delete years of work, ChatGPT cannot, in my opinion and on the basis of my experience, be considered completely safe for professional use.
OpenAI, in its responses to me, referred to ‘privacy by design’ — which means that everything is deleted without a trace when users deactivate data sharing.","Within a couple of years of ChatGPT coming out, I had come to rely on the artificial-intelligence tool, for my work as a professor of plant sciences at the University of Cologne in Germany. Having signed up for OpenAI’s subscription plan, ChatGPT Plus, I used it as an assistant every day — to write e-mails, draft course descriptions, structure grant applications, revise publications, prepare lectures, create exams and analyse student responses, and even as an interactive tool as part of my teaching.

It was fast and flexible, and I found it reliable in a specific sense: it was always available, remembered the context of ongoing conversations and allowed me to retrieve and refine previous drafts. I was well aware that large language models such as those that power ChatGPT can produce seemingly confident but sometimes incorrect statements, so I never equated its reliability with factual accuracy, but instead relied on the continuity and apparent stability of the workspace.

But in August, I temporarily disabled the ‘data consent’ option because I wanted to see whether I would still have access to all of the model’s functions if I did not provide OpenAI with my data. At that moment, all of my chats were permanently deleted and the project folders were emptied — two years of carefully structured academic work disappeared. No warning appeared. There was no undo option. Just a blank page. Fortunately, I had saved partial copies of some conversations and materials, but large parts of my work were lost forever.

At first, I thought it was a mistake. I tried different browsers, devices and networks. I cleared the cache, reinstalled the app and even changed the settings back and forth. Nothing helped.

When I contacted OpenAI’s support, the first responses came from an AI agent. Only after repeated enquiries did a human employee respond, but the answer remained the same: the data were permanently lost and could not be recovered.

Accountability gap

This was not a case of losing random notes or idle chats. Among my discussions with ChatGPT were project folders containing multiple conversations that I had used to develop grant applications, prepare teaching materials, refine publication drafts and design exam analyses. This was intellectual scaffolding that had been built up over a two-year period.

AI for research: the ultimate guide to choosing the right tool

We are increasingly being encouraged to integrate generative AI into research and teaching. Individuals use it for writing, planning and teaching; universities are experimenting with embedding it into curricula. However, my case reveals a fundamental weakness: these tools were not developed with academic standards of reliability and accountability in mind.

If a single click can irrevocably delete years of work, ChatGPT cannot, in my opinion and on the basis of my experience, be considered completely safe for professional use. As a paying subscriber (€20 per month, or US$23), I assumed basic protective measures would be in place, including a warning about irreversible deletion, a recovery option, albeit time-limited, and backups or redundancy.

OpenAI, in its responses to me, referred to ‘privacy by design’ — which means that everything is deleted without a trace when users deactivate data sharing. The company was clear: once deleted, chats cannot be recovered, and there is no redundancy or backup that would allow such a thing (see ‘No going back’). Ultimately, OpenAI fulfilled what they saw as a commitment to my privacy as a user by deleting my information the second I asked them to.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-04064-7/d41586-025-04064-7_51933892.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 16:41:58.773543

​Richard Glasson, currently global CEO of Hogarth, will oversee the new operation as CEO of WPP Production.
“Bringing all of WPP’s craft expertise together in WPP Production reinforces our position at the heart of WPP's integrated offering.
WPP Production will consolidate the group’s extensive and specialist production resources into a single global organisation, with all teams operating on one platform using WPP Open’s production technology and AI-powered workflows.
This is about delivering exceptional value and setting new benchmarks for the quality and scale of content production worldwide.” The transition to WPP Production will take effect on February 23rd 2026.","​WPP has launched WPP Production, a new global production platform that brings together Hogarth with production teams and capabilities from across the WPP network.

WPP said the new offering is designed to unify all creative producers into a single global organisation and combine production expertise with technology, including generative AI, virtual and hybrid production and data-driven workflows.

The move follows similar consolidation efforts by other holding companies, including Publicis Groupe and Omnicom, which operate as Publicis Production and Omnicom Production respectively.

​Richard Glasson, currently global CEO of Hogarth, will oversee the new operation as CEO of WPP Production. “This is a transformative moment for us and, more importantly, for our clients,” he said. “Bringing all of WPP’s craft expertise together in WPP Production reinforces our position at the heart of WPP's integrated offering. It allows us to activate the full collective power of WPP – its talent, creativity, technology and data – to redefine content creation. We are focused on delivering smarter, more innovative and world-class storytelling that drives business for our clients.”

WPP said the launch is built around four core areas: creating a “unified global team” of craft and production experts; integrating agency-based producers into a single global structure; investing in talent and technology to support “next-generation content origination”; and launching a “high-velocity content studio” that combines production and media capabilities, with a focus on performance and real-time optimisation.

WPP Production will consolidate the group’s extensive and specialist production resources into a single global organisation, with all teams operating on one platform using WPP Open’s production technology and AI-powered workflows. The company said this is intended to improve connectivity across markets and increase operational efficiency.

The group said the move establishes what it describes as the world’s largest creative production capability, comprising close to 10,000 people across more than 40 cities and designed to deliver large volumes of content across multiple channels and geographies.

The new offering reflects what WPP lays out as its broader strategy to provide more integrated and seamless services across creative, media and production, delivered through WPP Open. The company said this approach is intended to give clients access to a more connected ecosystem of creative, media and production expertise.

The company added that WPP Production will focus on the use of technologies including advanced AI, virtual production and sustainable production practices, with the aim of supporting next-generation content creation and premium content at scale.

WPP also said it will continue to invest in physical production infrastructure, building on the existing Hogarth Studios network and the recent development of a major content capture and virtual production studio in London. The company said it plans to open a number of additional major studio locations globally.

According to the announcement, clients will have access to faster turnaround times, greater cost efficiency and a wider range of production solutions through the new structure.

“The launch of WPP Production is a cornerstone of our strategic vision to integrate our services, making it easier for clients to access WPP’s full spectrum of capabilities,” said Cindy Rose, CEO of WPP. “In a rapidly evolving landscape where content is king, WPP Production will be the powerhouse that enables us to be the trusted growth partner for our clients. This is about delivering exceptional value and setting new benchmarks for the quality and scale of content production worldwide.”

The transition to WPP Production will take effect on February 23rd 2026.",https://d3q27bh1u24u2o.cloudfront.net/news/2026-01/wpp-prod.T6qcK-pV.png,N,,2026-01-22 13:42:32.493528

What Happened: Oracle Network Called Undervalued

Hougan's assessment focuses on Chainlink's function as a decentralized oracle network that delivers real-world data to blockchains.

Without this technology, financial applications on distributed ledgers cannot access external information like asset prices or payment confirmations.

The executive emphasized that major financial institutions already depend on Chainlink's services.

The stablecoin sector relies on its price feeds for maintaining pegs and conducting Proof of Reserves audits.

Tokenized real-world assets—including stocks, bonds and commodities—require the oracle network for regulatory compliance and accurate settlement.

The breadth of institutional adoption supports the undervaluation thesis. SWIFT, DTCC, JPMorgan, Visa, Mastercard and Fidelity have all integrated or experimented with Chainlink's technology for cross-chain interoperability and blockchain-based settlement.

Also Read: Ethereum Reserves Hit 10-Year Low Across Exchanges As Price Falls Below $3K

Why It Matters: Infrastructure Meets Wall Street

Hougan's analysis suggests that demand for oracle services will grow exponentially as real-world asset tokenization expands and decentralized finance markets continue developing.

The network maintains dominant market share, often cited above 50% of total value secured by oracles.

The LINK token functions as both payment for data services and collateral that node operators must stake against accurate performance. This economic model ties security directly to network demand.

The convergence of institutional adoption and DeFi growth positions Chainlink's infrastructure as increasingly critical to both blockchain and traditional finance systems.

An Anduril spokesperson said “we don’t have a timeline for IPO” and called rumours about a 2026 flotation “pure speculation”.","You’ve probably heard of “unicorns” – technology startups valued at more than $1bn – but 2026 is shaping up to be the year of the “hectocorn”, with several US and European companies potentially floating on stock markets at valuations over $100bn (£75bn).

OpenAI, Anthropic, SpaceX and Stripe are among the big names said to be considering an initial public offering (IPO) this year.

The success of their flotations – whether the shares maintain their value, rise or fall – could shape concerns about the AI race and whether the resulting market mania is a bubble.

Some may have had plans to float last year that were delayed or derailed by the US federal shutdown and sweeping government job cuts hitting the market watchdog. This year is shaping up to be similarly geopolitically choppy, with Trump’s latest tariff threats against European allies over Greenland casting a shadow over shares this week.

However, despite last year’s turmoil markets soared to near-record highs on the back of the AI boom, and investors are expected to keep betting big on the technology for now. Here are 10 of the companies most likely to take advantage of that enthusiasm with an IPO.

OpenAI

The San Francisco-based company is synonymous with AI, having triggered a frenzy of public interest in the subject with the launch of the ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. It is a loss-making business but has attracted investment from big names including Microsoft and the Japanese group SoftBank, and its valuation has boomed from $29bn in 2023 to $500bn last year. If OpenAI floats it could be valued at as much as $1tn, according to Reuters.

Underpinning these numbers is a hope that demand for AI, and the transformative impact of its adoption by workplaces and individuals, more than pays back the multitrillion-dollar investment in the datacentres and computer chips that support it. OpenAI is committed to spending $1.4tn on such infrastructure over the next eight years, but must convince investors it can pay that back.

“OpenAI is clearly the single biggest test for the entire AI economy, the bubble idea and whether it’s all built on sand,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets.

Anthropic

Like OpenAI, the San Francisco-headquartered startup behind the chatbot Claude and the now wildly popular Claude Code is also yet to turn a profit. This month, the company signed a term sheet for a $10bn funding round that puts its valuation at $350bn.

If Anthropic floats, it may have ramifications that go beyond the AI race. Many of its employees are aligned with the effective altruism movement, and energetic discussion on internet forums suggests that money could pour into causes aligned with this movement if its employees cash out.

SpaceX

Elon Musk’s company reportedly reached a $800bn valuation in December and is preparing to go public. However, “whether it actually happens, when it happens, and at what valuation are still highly uncertain”, according to comments from its chief financial officer, Bret Johnsen, in a letter obtained by Reuters.

On the one hand, geopolitical volatility is likely to make the nexus between tech, aerospace and defence more appealing to investors, said Mike Bellin at PricewaterhouseCoopers. This may have ramifications for SpaceX. On the other, Elon Musk’s reputation, and that of Tesla, make the outcome of the IPO somewhat harder to predict, said Mark Moccia, an analyst at research firm Forrester, although he expects “a huge mix of institutional and retail investors”.

“SpaceX in particular is what retail investors are homing in on this year as it’s got the buzz and it’s Musk,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets.

Kraken

One of the world’s largest crypto exchanges – not to be confused with the software spin-off of the UK energy firm Octopus – Kraken submitted its paperwork for an IPO in November, and was valued roughly at $20bn. The crypto firm could face a race to float its stock before this year’s US midterm elections, say analysts, as there is a risk political changes in the US reverse Trump’s laissez-faire approach to crypto regulation.

Databricks

This company helps customers to build AI agents – tools that carry out tasks autonomously – using their own data. Its revenue grew more than 55% last year and last month it achieved a valuation of $134bn.

Ali Ghodsi, Databricks’ chief executive, says the company’s growth rate is due to businesses building “data-intensive applications that use AI”.

Canva

A bright light of Australia’s tech industry, Canva was valued last year at $A65bn, although it has moved its parent company domicile to the US in order to prepare for a flotation. The Sydney-based software design company, which calls its employees “Canvanauts”, has 240 million users and two of its co-founders – the wife and husband team Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht – are sixth on the Australian rich list, according to the Financial Review, with a combined fortune of $14bn.

A Canva spokesperson said it had “nothing to share in terms of an IPO timeline”.

Anduril

Palmer Luckey, the chief executive of the defence-tech startup, has said Anduril is “definitely going to be a publicly traded company”, but has not given a timeline. Analysts cite the company’s close ties with the Trump administration and Trump’s decision to hike military spending as factors that may push it towards an offering this year.

“Trump’s 50% increase in defence spending announcement should be the green light to go for it,” said Wilson.

An Anduril spokesperson said “we don’t have a timeline for IPO” and called rumours about a 2026 flotation “pure speculation”.

Monzo

Monzo is an online bank that operates entirely through a mobile app. It reported more than 12 million customers in 2025.

The London-based fintech – the jargon for tech firms that offer financial services like banking or payments – was reportedly working with Morgan Stanley last summer to meet investors before a 2026 IPO – but this was later complicated by the exit of its chief executive, TS Anil.

Bolt

The Estonian rival to Uber, Bolt lined up an adviser for an IPO last year. The company has had a difficult few years, however, with reported losses of more than €102m in 2024. The company is reportedly considering whether to list in the EU or the US.

A Bolt spokesperson said: “Any date for listing will depend on favourable market conditions, which remains a significant factor in determining when Bolt goes public. Our teams are working to ensure the business is ready to IPO, should market conditions be right.”

Stripe

The online payment processing company was founded by the Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison in 2010. It has headquarters in California and Dublin and has long been a cornerstone of fintech. Last year it was reported that Stripe had attained a valuation of $107bn, a bounceback from when it was valued at $50bn in 2023. A Stripe spokesperson declined to comment.

Anthropic, Kraken, Monzo, SpaceX and Databricks did not respond to requests for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52f28e3778e0def3eb14d4cf2f324385763c3788/467_0_2672_2138/master/2672.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8880a14137c62ac1f0b7024f95f4ae53",N,,2026-01-22 14:42:15.325435

The joint solution combines Keyfactor’s cryptographic discovery, PKI, digital signing, and lifecycle automation with IBM Consulting’s cybersecurity expertise, governance frameworks, and quantum-safe delivery methods.

Enterprises using the solution gain automated cryptographic discovery, risk scoring and prioritization, PQC-ready PKI and signing, lifecycle automation, and governance structures aligned with NIST, EU, and global PQC guidance.

PRESS RELEASE — Keyfactor, the leader in digital trust for modern enterprises, today announced a new joint solution with IBM Consulting that gives enterprises visibility into their cryptographic assets to help reduce operational and regulatory risk, and accelerate readiness for post-quantum cryptography (PQC). The joint solution combines Keyfactor’s industry-leading cryptographic discovery, PKI, digital signing, and certificate lifecycle automation capabilities with IBM Consulting’s global cybersecurity expertise, governance frameworks, and enterprise-scale quantum-safe delivery methods, accelerators, and AI-based assets.

Cryptography powers every connection, transaction, and digital interaction, yet it remains one of the most vulnerable and least understood dependencies in the modern enterprise. Certificates, keys, algorithms, protocols, and libraries span across infrastructure, networks, devices, applications, and third-party solutions, often with fragmented ownership and inconsistent controls. This lack of unified visibility leaves organizations vulnerable to outages, audit gaps, and rising security and compliance risks as quantum computing timelines accelerate. At the same time, emerging regulations and PQC guidance are increasing the pressure on enterprises to demonstrate control and modernization across their entire cryptographic landscape.

“Cryptography sits at the center of every digital interaction, yet most enterprises struggle to see or understand the full scope of their cryptographic footprint,” said Ted Shorter, Chief Technology Officer and Co-Founder of Keyfactor. “By combining Keyfactor’s ability to discover, automate, and modernize cryptography with IBM Consulting’s deep expertise in strategy, governance, and quantum-safe transformation, organizations get a practical, end-to-end path from cryptographic complexity to clarity and control. This partnership empowers enterprises to reduce risk today while preparing confidently for tomorrow.”

The joint solution provides enterprises with clarity, control, and a structured modernization path to transition from reactive cryptography management to a governed and automated approach to quantum-safe readiness. Joint clients can benefit from four key integrated areas:

End-to-end cryptographic discovery & inventory

Automated discovery reveals where cryptographic assets live across on-prem, cloud, hybrid, and DevOps environments, exposing blind spots and shadow cryptography. The solution enables enterprises to build a comprehensive cryptographic inventory and Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM).

Risk scoring & prioritization

By combining IBM Consulting’s business and regulatory expertise and quantum-safe transformation services, including IBM Quantum Safe Migration Orchestrator, with visibility and risk-based insights from Keyfactor, organizations gain structured risk analysis, governance models, and prioritized remediation plans.

Modern PKI, signing, and lifecycle automation

Keyfactor’s EJBCA, SignServer, and Command solutions provide PQC-ready PKI, centralized signing, and automated certificate lifecycle management — replacing manual work with policy-driven processes that strengthen security, reduce operational friction, and significantly reduce outage risk.

Governance and long-term resilience

IBM Consulting establishes scalable operating models, including cryptographic Centers of Excellence (CCoEs), governance frameworks, KPIs, and training to drive sustainable modernization and quantum-safe transformation.

Together, these components create an actionable, phased modernization path aligned to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), EU, and global PQC guidance — from initial discovery to long-term crypto-agility.

“Quantum-safe transformation is more than a cryptographic upgrade; it’s a major operational shift that requires coordination across people, processes, and technology,” said Dinesh Nagarajan, Global Partner, Cybersecurity, IBM Consulting. “Enterprises shouldn’t shoulder that journey alone. Partnering with experts who have deep cryptographic expertise and a track record of delivering complex, enterprise-wide transformations facilitates a smoother, more secure transition. Working with Keyfactor, we can help organizations uncover hidden risks, modernize their trust infrastructure, and build long-term resilience as the quantum era approaches.”

The decision came after discussions between L’Oréal’s top management and a delegation from the state government during the World Economic Forum (WEF 2026).

Reuters reported that the group will invest more than Rs35bn ($383.4m) in the facility, which is being positioned as a global base for innovation, technology, data and supply-chain operations.

The centre is expected to underpin L’Oréal’s worldwide programmes in digital transformation, AI and analytics, and to generate 2,000 technology roles by 2030.

In November 2025, L’Oréal said it would set up one of its largest global capability centres (GCCs) in Hyderabad, separate from its Indian research operations in Mumbai and Bengaluru.

At the time, the company stated that the site would support global technology, innovation and research activities for the group, and that it had begun searching for senior executives for the project, including candidates from its Paris headquarters.

L’Oréal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus said the group was pleased to proceed with the development and that “tech solutions generated from the Hyderabad GCC will be supplied to our facilities all around the world”.

In a Facebook post, the Telangana delegation led by chief minister A Revanth Reddy said the project would take the form of a GCC focused on beauty technology.

Telangana IT minister D Sridhar Babu added that the state was prepared to offer full backing to international investors and pointed to Hyderabad’s growing presence as a host for GCCs across sectors such as med-tech, health-tech and hospitality.

Sanjay Kumar, special chief secretary for information technology, electronics, communications and industries, invited L’Oréal to also consider establishing manufacturing facilities in the state alongside the GCC.

According to the Facebook update from Telangana’s information and public relations department, Hieronimus responded favourably and indicated the company would examine the possibility of future investment in a production unit in Hyderabad.

Reports surfaced indicating that Peet’s Coffee (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., had been listed as an ‘executed person’ due to ongoing litigation.
Despite these challenges, JDE Peet's—the parent company formed through a merger between Jacobs Douwe Egberts and Peet's in 2019—continues to thrive on multiple fronts.
Known for housing over 50 brands including L'OR and Senseo alongside its flagship name, JDE Peet's operates across more than 100 countries worldwide.
In August 2025, Keurig Dr Pepper announced plans to acquire JDE Peet’s for €15.7 billion (approximately $17 billion).","In the bustling world of coffee, few names resonate as deeply as Peet's Coffee. Founded by Alfred Peet in 1966, this brand is often credited with igniting America’s specialty coffee movement. With its rich history and commitment to quality, Peet's has carved out a unique niche that appeals to discerning coffee lovers everywhere.

Recently, however, the company found itself navigating turbulent waters following some unsettling news regarding its operations in China. Reports surfaced indicating that Peet’s Coffee (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., had been listed as an ‘executed person’ due to ongoing litigation. This label can evoke concern among consumers and investors alike—what does it mean for such a beloved brand?

But here’s where things get interesting: shortly after these reports emerged, the information mysteriously vanished from public records. A spokesperson for Peet’s clarified that this was merely related to an active lawsuit and assured stakeholders that the situation was under control; indeed, they stated that any adverse listings were retracted once verified.

This incident highlights not only the complexities of operating within international markets but also how quickly perceptions can shift based on fleeting information. The legal landscape can be daunting for companies expanding globally—especially when dealing with different jurisdictions like China.

Despite these challenges, JDE Peet's—the parent company formed through a merger between Jacobs Douwe Egberts and Peet's in 2019—continues to thrive on multiple fronts. Known for housing over 50 brands including L'OR and Senseo alongside its flagship name, JDE Peet's operates across more than 100 countries worldwide.

The company's financial health remains robust; recent reports indicate organic sales growth of 5.3% along with significant cash flow generation—a testament to their strategic positioning within both developing and developed markets.

Moreover, exciting developments are on the horizon! In August 2025, Keurig Dr Pepper announced plans to acquire JDE Peet’s for €15.7 billion (approximately $17 billion). This acquisition will lead KDP into restructuring efforts aimed at creating two independent publicly traded entities focused solely on beverages and global coffee respectively—a move anticipated by many industry experts as beneficial given current market trends toward specialization.

As we look ahead at what lies in store for brands like Peet’s Coffee amidst corporate transitions and evolving consumer preferences one thing is clear: their dedication towards crafting exceptional coffee experiences continues unabated—even if external circumstances may momentarily cloud their path.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-23 02:38:33.586396

It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.
As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer.

Discovery, while doubling down on a coming proxy fight.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that's still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,"" Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it's “clear our shareholders agree,"" as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner's studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner’s board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount’s bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.

Warner stockholders now have until Feb. 20 to sell their shares to Paramount for $30 apiece in cash — a price that remains unchanged, giving the offer a total enterprise value of over $108 billion including debt. It marks the second extension the company has made since challenging Warner’s merger agreement with Netflix last month.

As of late Wednesday, Paramount said that more than 168.5 million Warner shares had been tendered in support of its offer. But that's still far below the 50% mark it would need to effectively gain control of Warner — which has about 2.48 billion shares outstanding in series A common stock today.

“Once again, Paramount continues to make the same offer our Board has repeatedly and unanimously rejected in favor of a superior merger agreement with Netflix,"" Warner said in an emailed statement Thursday — adding that it's “clear our shareholders agree,"" as more than 93% have so far rejected “Paramount’s inferior scheme.”

In December, Netflix agreed to buy Warner's studio and streaming business for $72 billion — now in an all-cash deal that the companies say is more straight forward and will speed up the path to a shareholder vote by April. Including debt, the enterprise value of the deal is about $83 billion, or $27.75 per share.

But Paramount argues its offer is better than Netflix’s and has accused Warner leadership of not being transparent with stockholders. On Thursday, the company claimed Warner’s board was “rushing to solicit shareholder approval” for the Netflix merger, which it said could lead to a lower payout for shareholders if debt spanning from a previously-announced spinoff of Warner’s networks business makes its way to studio and streaming operations.

In an escalation of its hostile bid, Paramount is also moving forward with a proxy fight. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to nominate its own slate of directors to Warner’s board before the next shareholder meeting. And on Thursday, Paramount filed preliminary materials to solicit proxies in opposition to the Netflix merger.

The battle for Warner and the value of each offer grows complicated because Netflix and Paramount want different things. Netflix’s proposed acquisition includes only Warner’s studio and streaming business, including its legacy TV and movie production arms and platforms like HBO Max. But Paramount’s bid is for the entire company — which, beyond studio and streaming, includes its news and cable operations. That would put CNN under the same roof as CBS.

If Netflix is successful, Warner’s current networks would be spun off into their own company called Discovery Global, under a previously-announced separation.

Regardless of who wins the upper hand, a Warner Bros. Discovery sale could be a long, drawn-out process — likely attracting tremendous antitrust scrutiny. Politics are expected to come into play under President Donald Trump, who has made unprecedented suggestions about his personal involvement on whether a deal will go through.",https://assets.tegnaone.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/a80fdaff-1f6d-4d41-a608-06ea429c5b2f/20260122T142505/a80fdaff-1f6d-4d41-a608-06ea429c5b2f.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 13:00:23.398682

It started several multi-year PPAs during the year, securing around 3 TWh of additional annual low-carbon electricity. This compares with 2.5 TWh signed in 2024.

The agreements are concentrated in regions with carbon-intensive power grids, including China and South Africa. In 2025, Air Liquide also signed its first PPAs in India, marking its entry into a market where electricity demand rose by nearly 75% between 2013 and 2023.

In South Africa, the company is working with chemicals and energy firm Sasol to source close to 700MW of renewable electricity for the Secunda site, described as the world’s largest oxygen production facility.

According to its 2024 figures, more than 40% of Air Liquide’s total purchased electricity now comes from low-carbon sources, including wind and solar.

Electricity sourcing is one of three pillars of the group’s decarbonisation roadmap, alongside asset optimisation to reduce energy consumption and the deployment of carbon capture and storage.

“[We aim to secure] additional low-carbon capacity on top of grid transition in geographies where we operate,” said Diana Schillag, a member of Air Liquide’s Executive Committee.

The strategy is complemented by the electrification of selected air separation units. In China, the electrification of the Shaanxi ASU, combined with low-carbon power sourcing, is expected to reduce the group’s emissions by up to 550,000 tonnes per year.

“European banks were on average very well managed, lean machines before rates inflected,” Wedekind says.","European banks enjoyed a record year for returns in 2025, in which the Euro Stoxx Banks index surged 98.1%.

Financials, and banking stocks in particular, was one of a narrow collection of sectors driving European market returns as a whole last year. Given the record run, investors are beginning to ask whether the sector continue its momentum in 2026.

Portfolio Adviser asks European and global fund managers for their views on the sector moving forward.

What has driven recent returns?

The rally in European banking stocks has been stark, with the sector up over 331.7% over the five years to the end of last year.

Société Générale was the highest returning stock within the 29-holding Amundi Euro Stoxx Banks ETF last year, returning 159.28%, according to Morningstar data. Names such as Commerzbank, Banco Santander and ABM AMRO Bank also returned over 100% last year alone. Strikingly, every member of the index fund was up for the year.

The sector has enjoyed multiple tailwinds which have contributed to the run since the Covid-19 pandemic. Looking at recent financial results from last year, Marc Stacey, a senior portfolio manager within RBC Bluebay Asset Management’s investment grade team, highlights a particular trend to demonstrate the remarkable run.

“The last quarter saw the vast majority of the sector report earnings, with trends continuing in line with our bullish view on fundamentals,” he says. “Pre-provision operating profits beat on aggregate by 4%. This is the 27th quarter in a row of outperformance. This is an incredible statistic, given it’s against increasingly lofty market expectations.”

European equities more broadly have also participated in a value rally, with financials one of the key beneficiaries.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, European financials were restricted by regulators on dividends and share buybacks. These limits, combined with uncertainty around the longer-term economic impact, pushed valuations to meaningfully depressed levels, notes Allspring Global Investments global equity portfolio manager Jonathan Drexel.

“As clarity returned and restrictions were lifted, valuations reverted toward more historical norms,” he says. “Since the pandemic, European banks have significantly improved both profitability and balance sheet strength, leading to a rerating of the sector alongside renewed earnings momentum.”

However, Frank Wedekind, global equity research analyst at William Blair Investment Management, says the outperformance in European Banks is not just part of a value rally or a ‘fluke’, rather it is due to a combination of sector dynamics.

He particularly notes the fundamental lack of economic growth in Western Europe, which has forced the sector to adapt to stay competitive. Management teams have had to become more efficient, adapt their product range and, in many cases, consolidate.

The changing interest rate environment has also contributed. “European banks were on average very well managed, lean machines before rates inflected,” Wedekind says. “The higher rates then fell on very fertile ground, that dropped through to the bottom line.”

What’s the investment case from here?

Moving forward, Mirabaud Discovery Europe fund portfolio manager Hywel Franklin says the sector still offers meaningful upside, with many European financials still set to deliver 10–15% annual earnings growth alongside substantial dividend payouts.

“Valuations remain compelling, especially versus the US, where parts of the market now trade at stretched multiples,” he says.

“With Europe continuing to rebound and investor flows gradually shifting, the environment remains supportive. Well-run banks such as Credem in Italy highlight how undervaluation and strong fundamentals can coexist.”

In terms of positioning, Franklin is maintaining the fund’s exposure to the sector.

“Earnings momentum is intact, valuations remain attractive, and the sector continues to benefit from improving macro conditions. More broadly, Europe appears to be in the early stages of a re-rating cycle, and financials remain one of the clearer beneficiaries.”

Considering the re-rating that has taken place within the sector already, however, William Blair’s Wedekind says the focus from here is on being selective with exposure.

“We continue to like the space and continue to see attractive investment stories for many individual names. But, as the sector valuation is not as attractive as it has been and as many stocks are trading close to or in some cases above what we would consider as fair value, we have become a lot more selective.”

Markus Hansen, portfolio manager at Vontobel Quality Growth, adds his focus within the sector is on countries with a disciplined competitive banking market set up, such as the UK, Scandinavian nations and Greece.

“We have been tactically adding to the names we own: NatWest Group, Den Norske Bank DNB, Svenska Handelsbanken and Eurobank Ergasias.

“We also think international investors have been cautious towards European banks given the recent history and there may still be political backdrop worries, hence focus on more quality, sustainable growth names is key for us.”

“We maintain our conviction in the banks over the medium term due to their high and attractive shareholder returns and modest valuation compared to historic averages, despite the recent strong performance,” adds Brian Hall, co-manager of the BlackRock Greater Europe Investment Trust.",https://s44696.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/euro-bank-notes-V1.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 08:40:01.082892

Société Générale didn’t detail the types of roles that could be affected by these changes but said that the change would occur within the framework of the measures set out in an Employment Agreement signed on in December last year with three trade unions.

The latest phase of the roadmap, which includes the role net reduction proposals, is a so-called “organisational simplification” project conducted by 2,000 employees throughout all areas of the bank.

According to the bank, its employees came up with thousands of ideas to “optimise tools and procurement, simplify processes and structures, pool teams, and strengthen automation and the use of artificial intelligence”.

The bank also wants to undergo what it calls an “organisational revolution”, in which it aims to simplify the way it operates to become “more efficient” and “agile”.

The bank claims the move is to better serve clients. Société Générale said this would affect how much of its headquarters operates and how it organises retail banking regionally, though its branch network will stay the same.

When it comes to retraining staff, the organisation plans to establish a mobility and skills campus. Focused on driving internal mobility, it will be designed to help staff forge and succeed in new careers at the bank.

Many of the new skills that staff will be required to acquire will be taught through the Société Générale University.",https://www.fstech.co.uk/fst/images/societe generale.png,N,,2026-01-22 09:40:18.722044

Attachment Liquid Carbon Dioxide Market","Dublin, Jan. 22, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Liquid Carbon Dioxide Market Report 2026"" has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

The liquid carbon dioxide market is poised for robust growth, with the market size increasing from $6.54 billion in 2025 to an anticipated $9.23 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.1%. This growth is driven by rising adoption of supercritical CO2 for sustainable processing, demand for liquid CO2 in precision cooling, and expansion in fire suppression solutions. The increased deployment of carbon capture infrastructure and advancements in liquefaction technologies are also crucial growth factors.

The food and beverage industry remains a significant driver, utilizing liquid CO2 for carbonation, refrigeration, and preservation. Statistics Canada reported in June 2025 that food and beverage sales comprised nearly one-quarter of Canada's total retail spending in 2024, highlighting rising consumer demand. This growth is further supported by technological innovations such as liquid carbon dioxide carriers, designed to optimize storage and reduce transportation costs, exemplified by Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Co. Ltd.'s introduction of a new carrier in 2025.

Strategic acquisitions are also shaping the market landscape. In January 2025, Alto Ingredients Inc. acquired Kodiak Carbonic LLC, a move aimed at enhancing operational efficiency and profitability through the optimized use of byproduct CO2. Such acquisitions highlight the focus on securing sustainable revenue streams and expanding market presence.

Major companies such as Linde plc, Air Liquide Deutschland GmbH, and Praxair Inc. are leading innovations across various applications from food and beverage processing to metal fabrication and pharmaceuticals. North America was the largest market in 2025, but Asia-Pacific is expected to lead growth through the forecast period, reflecting the dynamic regional shifts within the industry.

However, the market faces challenges from global trade relations and tariffs, potentially reshaping dynamics by increasing import costs for industrial gases and related equipment. These factors have prompted local manufacturers to bolster regional capacities, enhancing supply security and competitiveness amid rising international costs.

Overall, the liquid carbon dioxide market offers considerable opportunities for growth and innovation. With advancements across multiple sectors and strategic actions by key players, the market is set to thrive despite potential geopolitical challenges. This market analysis provides a comprehensive exploration of current trends, future opportunities, and strategic insights for stakeholders invested in the future of the liquid carbon dioxide industry.

Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) has entered into a partnership with Precision Neuroscience to advance brain computer interface technology in neurosurgery.

The company has also agreed to acquire a significant stake in Anteris Technologies, a developer of a transcatheter aortic valve replacement device.

For a medical technology giant like Medtronic, these moves touch two core areas: neurosurgery and structural heart care. Brain computer interface tools aim to bring new options into the operating room, while transcatheter aortic valve replacement continues to be an area of focus for treating heart valve disease without open heart surgery.

The way these technologies progress through clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones will be important markers for how Medtronic’s product mix and risk profile could change over time.

What This Activity Could Signal for Medtronic Investors

The BCI partnership with Precision Neuroscience and the planned stake of up to US$90 million in Anteris point to Medtronic leaning further into neurosurgery and structural heart devices that are still early in their commercial journey. For you as an investor, it highlights that management is prepared to allocate capital to higher complexity procedures that could deepen Medtronic’s role in brain and heart interventions if clinical and regulatory progress stays on track.

How This Fits Into The Medtronic Narrative

Recent moves, including the spin off plan for the diabetes unit, regulatory clearance for the Hugo robotic surgery system, and now investments in BCI and transcatheter valves, all point to a tighter focus on hospital based B2B technologies. For investors who already view Medtronic as a broad medtech platform, this news can reinforce a story that is tilting more toward advanced surgery, neuroscience, and cardiology, while still backed by a long record of dividend increases.

Risks and Rewards To Keep In Mind

BCI integration with the StealthStation system and exposure to a new transcatheter valve could expand Medtronic’s addressable procedures in neurosurgery and structural heart care.

Management is supporting these bets from a position that screens as good value and with a dividend that has risen for 48 consecutive years, which some income focused investors may appreciate.

Clinical and regulatory timelines for both BCI systems and aortic valve devices can be long and uncertain, so payoffs may be uneven or delayed versus expectations.

More capital tied to new technologies adds execution risk, particularly if competitors move quickly or trial results and reimbursement decisions do not support broad adoption.

What To Watch Next

From here, the key things to track are progress in the PARADIGM trial for Anteris, clinical integration of Precision’s Layer 7 interface with StealthStation in real world neurosurgical workflows, and any updates around the diabetes spin off and Hugo robotic rollout, as these all shape how concentrated Medtronic’s future earnings mix becomes.

Summary

I conduct a comprehensive technical scan of all S&P 500 stocks to gauge macro market trends and sector rotation.

Current ETF analysis highlights DIA, QQQ, and SPY, with special attention to the democratization trend beyond the top 50 stocks.

RSP is rallying but has only recovered recent underperformance versus XLG; the sustainability of smaller stock outperformance remains uncertain.

Out of 500 S&P 500 stocks, I found only 15 to list that I'd say have ""good"" charts. Most of the rest are either high risk or going nowhere.

ICEYE satellite data will be used to monitor floods, fires and storms as it expands predictive risk services.

AXA DCP, which uses AI to assess threats, said the satellite data will be applied across areas including natural catastrophes, cybercrime and geopolitical risk analysis.

AXA DCP CEO Pierre du Rostu said: “We are responding to the challenge of the polycrisis by evolving. Our goal is to make use of the very best solutions available to move beyond response to prediction and prevention.

“ICEYE is a world leader in monitoring natural catastrophes and provides the real-time insights our clients require even when it is dark, when there are clouds, when there is dust, smoke, or volcanic ash.”

ICEYE runs what it describes as the world’s “largest” constellation of SAR microsatellites, providing imagery to governments, defence organisations, intelligence bodies and commercial clients.

Its satellites are capable of near real-time observation regardless of weather or daylight, offering global coverage, frequent revisit rates and image resolution of around 25cm, the press statement read.

AXA DCP said the agreement supports its shift towards greater emphasis on prediction and prevention, helping customers anticipate disruptive events and limit potential damage.

It added that the collaboration is intended to strengthen AXA DCP’s capacity to evaluate and manage weather-related exposures through satellite-derived insights.

ICEYE Solutions senior vice-president Stephen Lathrope added: “Scaling access to ICEYE’s advanced SAR technology through AXA DCP is a transformative step for the insurance and risk management sector. It enables organisations to harness cutting-edge innovation at scale, unlock new insights, and fundamentally change how they prepare for, respond to and recover from catastrophic events.”",https://www.lifeinsuranceinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2026/01/shutterstock_2655645491.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 05:59:55.260706

In his quest to gain more control over the Fed, Trump will have to jump though hoops in the Supreme Court and Congress while stomaching discontent from Wall Street, a tall task even for a president accustomed to blowing past rules and norms.

“The defenses against presidential intrusion are multilayered and very well designed,” said Gary Richardson, an economics professor at the University of California, Irvine, and the Fed’s historian from 2012 to 2016.

Trump is on a campaign to get the Fed to slash the interest rate at which banks lend money to each other overnight, which influences the interest rates consumers pay on credit cards, mortgages and car loans.

It currently sits between 3.5% and 3.75%, putting a slight damper on spending to keep inflation manageable.

The president told The Wall Street Journal in December he’d like that figure to fall to “1% and maybe lower than that.” He’s also insulted Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a “moron” and a “stubborn mule,” among other critical remarks, for supporting only slight reductions in interest rates.

Supply and demand

Bringing rates down fast likely would juice the economy in the short term while sowing long-run cost hikes, according to John Canavan, lead U.S. analyst at Oxford Economics. That may be a fine trade-off to term-limited presidents looking to project strength, but it’s a bad outcome in the view of economists.

“When demand exceeds supply, you get inflation,” Canavan said. “If rates are kept too low, the economy will overheat.”

Unduly cutting rates also would violate the Fed’s congressional mandate to pursue stable prices and maximum employment regardless of the political climate.

Yet, Trump has made several moves that critics view as pressure on the central bank to go along with his wishes for lower interest rates.

In August, he tried to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud. She has not been charged and denies the claims.

Cook sued the government in response, arguing the law only allows presidents to dismiss Fed officials “for cause.” The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case Wednesday and seemed to favor keeping Cook in her job, although a decision likely won’t come until the summer.

A ruling favorable to the Trump administration would eliminate evidence of wrongdoing as an obstacle to remaking the Fed’s seven-member board of governors.

“If an allegation alone is enough to define cause for removal, then that could be done to anybody sitting on the board,” said Loretta Mester, a University of Pennsylvania finance professor and head of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland from 2014 to 2024.

The Cleveland district covers Western Pennsylvania along with Ohio, eastern Kentucky and the West Virginia panhandle. Its current head, Beth Hammack, declined to comment.

Powell is also the subject of a criminal investigation related to cost overruns during renovations at the Fed’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. The Department of Justice issued subpoenas Jan. 9 related to the probe, which Trump said he has no knowledge of and Powell has dismissed as politically motivated.

Even with the Supreme Court on his side, the Senate could stop Trump from handpicking Fed governors, which typically serve staggered 14-year terms.

Lawmakers have thrown up red flags, including many Democrats and several Republicans. U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., has said he won’t vote on any Fed nominees until the legal matter with Cook is resolved.

U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick, Pennsylvania’s Republican senator, has pushed for continued Fed independence, even as he remains aligned with Trump on the need for lower rates.

Speaking with bankers in Juniata County last week, McCormick said he finds it “very hard to believe that Chairman Powell was involved in anything criminal.”

Presidential resistance

It’s a common impulse among presidents to resent Fed independence.

Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Richard Nixon all mounted attempts to influence the central bank’s key interest rate in their day.

Roosevelt was the most successful, but only because he got Congress to change the law, according to Richardson. None have leaned on the courts and personal threats against Fed members as heavily as Trump, he said.

Market reactions also could restrain Trump in his bid to chip away at Fed independence.

Rising long-term bond yields would be one sign that investors fear the central bank’s decision-making could become clouded by politics. That happened to only a limited extent following news of the Powell investigation.

“That may be because the reaction was so strong by the political class that Wall Street was reasonably assured that there’s not going to be much of a challenge to independence,” said Chester Spatt, a finance professor at Carnegie Mellon University.

But the topic is clearly on the minds of prominent bankers.

Robin Vince, CEO of BNY Mellon, has warned the erosion of Fed independence could be “counterproductive” to the Trump administration’s efforts to lower the cost of living.

“Questioning one of the tenets that underlies the bond market runs the risk of doing the opposite — pushing interest rates higher — because markets may feel they have to worry about something they frankly shouldn’t have to worry about,” Vince said on a call with reporters last week.

Jamie Dimon, head of JPMorgan Chase, has made similar comments, prompting Trump to say he’ll be suing the company for “debanking him” after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots.

PNC Bank declined to make an executive available for an interview.

Political conflict aside, many economists believe the Fed should hold firm on the interest rate, for now. Inflation clocked in at 2.7% last month, reflecting a jump in prices compared to December 2024.

The Fed typically targets a 2% rate of inflation.

“I haven’t been convinced by the data I’ve seen that it’s on its way back down to 2%,” Mester said. “I think they’re in a good spot. This is a good time to just wait.”",https://storage.googleapis.com/ownlocal-adforge-production/articles/external/600/722da09b-bc8b-4baa-a75a-1e5cd6c56e57.webp,N,,2026-01-22 06:39:07.539757

In the second half of 2025, OpenEvidence had secured a $200 million funding round at a $6 billion valuation. The round was led by Google Ventures, with participation from top-tier venture firms including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Blackstone, Thrive Capital, Coatue Management, Bond and Craft.

Founded in 2022 by Daniel Nadler, who previously founded an AI start-up that was sold to S&P Global for $550 million, and Zachary Ziegler, OpenEvidence has rapidly established itself as an indispensable tool for physicians and nurses by serving as what many users describe as “ChatGPT for medicine.” Its AI is trained on authoritative medical journals such as JAMA and the New England Journal of Medicine, enabling clinicians to access verified, evidence-based answers swiftly to support patient treatment decisions. The platform is offered free to verified medical professionals, supported through advertising revenue, and has expanded to more than 10,000 hospitals and medical centers nationwide.

“Without a technology like OpenEvidence, doctors may miss critical new findings or guidelines simply because they lack the time to find them,” said Nadler. “Doctors want to provide the best care to patients. OpenEvidence is the tool that safely allows them to do that. Our mission is to help doctors save lives and improve patient care.” The company also said a recent independent study by Offcall showed that OpenEvidence is used by more American physicians than all other AI tools for physicians combined.

OpenEvidence’s user metrics have been cited repeatedly by company spokespeople and business press: roughly 40%-45% of U.S. physicians now use the platform, which the company says reaches more than 10,000 hospitals and medical centers. Usage escalated sharply through 2025, with reports that the platform processed about 18 million clinical consultations in December, up from a few million per month a year earlier.

The company says it generates revenue primarily through advertising and reported more than $100 million in annualized revenue, driven largely by organic adoption and physician-to-physician referrals, and up to 30% month-on-month growth. OpenEvidence has emphasizes a high retention and referral rate, claiming that 95% of new users learn about the app from other doctors. Those figures are part of the company’s pitch to investors that a physician-first product can scale without enterprise sales teams.

Nadler has framed OpenEvidence as purpose-built for clinicians while drawing a contrast with products based on generalist large language (LLM) models. “If you only squint from a distance, OpenEvidence is ‘ChatGPT’ for doctors. If you look closely, it’s a very different organism,” Nadler told New York Post.

Uber is expanding its luxury ride service, Uber Black, in India. The company plans to double its fleet size by 2026 in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru. This move targets urban commuters seeking comfort and reliability. Dedicated pickup zones are being established at major airports. Uber is also investing in fleet management firm Carrum to support this growth.

Uber is betting big on India’s growing appetite for premium mobility, announcing plans to double the fleet size of its Uber Black service in 2026 as it expands the availability of luxury rides across Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.

The expansion marks a sharpened focus on high-end urban commuters willing to pay more for comfort, reliability and top-rated drivers, even as India remains one of the world’s most price-sensitive ride-hailing markets.

Uber Black, positioned as the “business class” of Uber’s offerings, currently operates in the three metros with a curated fleet of high-quality vehicles and drivers. The company said the service has seen strong demand from riders seeking elevated service standards, particularly for airport travel and business use.

As part of the push, Uber has set up dedicated Uber Black pickup zones at major airports, including Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport (Terminals 1 and 2) and Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (Terminal 2). The premium zones are designed to offer faster, more seamless pickups using luxury vehicles.

To support the scale-up, Uber said it has made a Series A investment in Carrum, a fleet management firm backed by the CarDekho Group. Carrum has been a long-standing fleet partner for Uber in India, and the investment will be used to expand its vehicle base and operational capacity.

Live Events

""We’re witnessing strong demand for premium mobility in India, driven by riders who value comfort and elevated service standards,"" said Prabhjeet Singh, President, Uber India and South Asia.

Uber has also rolled out its Reserve feature on Uber Black in Delhi, allowing riders to pre-book premium rides from two hours up to 90 days in advance — a move aimed at frequent flyers and corporate users who value certainty.

As competition intensifies in India’s ride-hailing market, Uber’s premium push suggests the company is looking beyond scale alone — betting that a slice of India’s fast-growing urban middle and upper-middle class is ready to pay extra for reliability, comfort and a smoother ride.

India, a key growth market

The expansion underlines India’s importance to Uber at a time when the company is sharpening its focus on profitability and higher-value services globally. While Uber built its scale in India on mass-market offerings such as autos, bikes and budget cars, premium products like Uber Black signal a maturing urban customer base and rising discretionary spending in large cities.

Uber entered India in 2013 and now operates across 125 cities, offering services that range from two-wheelers and autos to cars, transit tickets and intercity travel.

Alongside premium rides, Uber is also seeing traction for Uber One, its paid membership programme that offers savings across multiple mobility options. The company said more than one million riders in India are already enrolled, reflecting growing loyalty among frequent users.

In 2025, significant 3 TWh per year multi-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) were started, securing its long term decarbonization trajectory.
In 2025, the Group also signed its first PPAs in India, covering a new geography with a highly carbon-intensive energy mix.
This also allows Air Liquide to provide its customers with gases with a lower carbon footprint, thereby supporting their own decarbonization goals.
Air Liquide sources more than 40%1 of its total purchased power from low-carbon sources, underscoring its commitment to structurally transforming its energy mix on a global scale.","Air Liquide confirms the effectiveness of its voluntary low-carbon electricity sourcing program, a core lever of its Climate Transition Plan, delivering concrete and impactful results. In 2025, significant 3 TWh per year multi-year Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) were started, securing its long term decarbonization trajectory.

This proactive approach is particularly focused on geographies with carbon intensive power grids to maximize emission reduction and impact, such as China and South Africa. In 2025, the Group also signed its first PPAs in India, covering a new geography with a highly carbon-intensive energy mix.

Since 2020, as part of its Climate objectives, the Group has signed PPAs that represent a total reduction of 3.5 million tonnes of CO2 per year, with full ramp-up expected by 2027. This also allows Air Liquide to provide its customers with gases with a lower carbon footprint, thereby supporting their own decarbonization goals.

Air Liquide sources more than 40%1 of its total purchased power from low-carbon sources, underscoring its commitment to structurally transforming its energy mix on a global scale. The sourcing of massive amounts of low-carbon electricity is one of the three levers of its decarbonization roadmap, which also includes asset management to reduce energy consumption, but also carbon capture and storage.

This sourcing approach is further complemented by the electrification of the few remaining non-electrified Air Separation Units (ASUs). For example, the electrification of the Shaanxi ASU announced in December 2025 combined with low-carbon energy sourcing are projected to yield a significant annual reduction of the Group’s emissions by up to 550,000 tonnes.

Diana Schillag, member of Air Liquide's Executive Committee notably in charge of Sustainable Development, stated:

“The ongoing deployment of our voluntary low-carbon electricity sourcing program is concrete evidence of our commitment to transforming our energy mix, securing additional low-carbon capacity on top of grid transition in geographies where we operate. Our goal is to maximize the impact of our actions on overall emissions reduction. It highlights the Group’s agility in using the best levers at hand to lower emissions as effectively as possible, particularly in carbon-intensive countries, while providing our customers with low-carbon solutions and supporting their own decarbonization efforts.”

The leather-clad CEO said this during the first episode of the “A Bit Personal with Jodi Shelton” podcast, wherein Shelton asked him where he gets his confidence.
Shelton is a self-proclaimed ""longtime leader in the global semiconductor industry,"" and is also the CEO and co-founder of the Global Semiconductor Alliance.
“By the way, Morris will be happy to know Nvidia is TSMC’s largest customer now.” The AI GPU company was once TSMC’s top customer in the early 2000s.
But if the AI bubble pops and we’re left with a lot of AI data centers with no customers, then we expect Apple to retake its position as TSMC’s number one customer.","Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said in an interview that Nvidia is TSMC’s largest customer at the moment, dethroning Apple, which has previously held the record for some time. The leather-clad CEO said this during the first episode of the “A Bit Personal with Jodi Shelton” podcast, wherein Shelton asked him where he gets his confidence. Shelton is a self-proclaimed ""longtime leader in the global semiconductor industry,"" and is also the CEO and co-founder of the Global Semiconductor Alliance.

“I remember Morris Chang has a similar story when he first met you, that you immediately said, ‘I’m going to be your biggest customer or one of your biggest customers. And he’s like, ‘Wow, that’s a lot of gumption.’ So, where did that confidence come from at such an early age?” Shelton asked. “Well, you know, it’s rough to know everything — I’m just kidding,” Jensen said with a laugh. “By the way, Morris will be happy to know Nvidia is TSMC’s largest customer now.”

The AI GPU company was once TSMC’s top customer in the early 2000s. However, it was overtaken during the 2010s by Apple when TSMC took it on as a customer to build the iPhone and iPad processors, after Intel fumbled the potential partnership with Cupertino. This was especially true during recent years when the iPhone overtook Samsung in market share across the globe.

But even if Apple’s smartphones, tablets, and even the legendary Apple silicon on Macs and MacBooks are driving record sales for the company, the AI boom is also pushing demand for Nvidia’s AI GPUs, resulting in skyrocketing revenue for the company. More than that, enterprise customers are willing to pay billions and billions to Team Green to get as many AI processors as they can, whereas many consumers have a price ceiling after which they will go with another brand if a smartphone, tablet, or laptop is priced too high.

Aside from losing its top spot, there are also rumors — reported by WCCFTech from the Apple leaker Fixed Focus Digital — that TSMC is hiking up the prices it’s charging Apple for chips, especially as the AI demand is squeezing capacity for other semiconductors. Furthermore, Cupertino might no longer have production priority. However, this is just speculation, and even if it’s true, the companies will likely keep information like this confidential.

Nvidia’s success is directly tied to the AI hype, with many tech companies pouring money into acquiring thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of GPUs just to get the horsepower to train the most advanced models. And with Team Green cornering the market for AI processors, it’s basically printing cash as long as companies feel that they can make more money by adding more computing power. But if the AI bubble pops and we’re left with a lot of AI data centers with no customers, then we expect Apple to retake its position as TSMC’s number one customer.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmoK3D8rdHXmLPVrrh8tTk-2000-80.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 03:38:27.180915

Amid intensifying competition pressures across its core creative markets, analyst sentiment surrounding Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) remains cautious. On January 14, 2026, Baird reduced its price target on the stock from $410.00 to $350.00, while reiterating a ‘Neutral’ rating.

The cautious sentiment was reinforced on January 9, 2026, when BMO Capital downgraded Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) from ‘Outperform’ to ‘Market Perform’ and reduced its target from $400.00 to $375.00. While acknowledging that competition among smaller businesses, students, and freelancers remains heightened, the investment firm believes the stock appears reasonably priced. However, the firm expects the shares to remain range-bound due to the lack of near-term catalysts.

Some analysts also hold a bearish stance. On January 12, 2026, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), assigning a ‘Sell’ rating with a $290.00 price target. The investment bank attributed its sentiment to growth slowing down among high-end users and the company’s limited exposure to the growing, budget-conscious segment.

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) leverages its Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing segments to provide digital marketing and media solutions. With its offerings, the company enables content creation, customer experience optimization, and digital collaboration worldwide.

Donald was born on March 18, 1938, in Albany, New York, to Jay and Beatrice Dillenbeck. He spent his childhood on a farm in Greene, New York, where he developed a lifelong love of land, hard work, and self-reliance.

On June 29, 1957, he married Rose Ann Snitchler at the Binghamton Pilgrim Holiness Church. Their marriage was a true partnership that spanned nearly seven decades and was marked by shared work, adventure, and devotion.

Donald and Rose raised four children: Judy Dillenbeck; Donna (Robert) Dunning; Denise (Mark Goodenberger) Dillenbeck, and Donald (Marlena) Dillenbeck Jr. He was a proud grandfather to eleven grandchildren and a great-grandfather to seven great-grandchildren.

He is survived by his sister, Joyce Knefley, and her husband, Michael. He was predeceased by his brothers Jay, David, and Mark.

From 1956 through 1987, Donald worked as an engineer at IBM in Glendale, Endicott, and Owego, New York. After retiring from IBM, he continued a life of purposeful work, including driving school buses for the Johnson City School District, managing receiving and maintenance at The Bon Ton department store at the Oakdale Mall, driving buses in Denali National Park, driving trucks for the American Red Cross and Midstate Litho, and working on various construction projects over the years. In his later years, he devoted himself to managing and caring for the woodland and farming acreage he and Rose called home.

Donald possessed a meticulous, engineering-minded approach to every project he undertook. He was always ready to help neighbors, assisting with road clearing after Hurricane Irene in 2011, volunteering more than 800 hours at Endicott Nazarene Church following the 2001 flood, and contributing to maintenance and building projects at Community Bible Church in Binghamton. A true pioneer at heart, he built his home with his own hands alongside Rose. Together, they shared adventures across the country, including working in Denali National Park, a cherished highlight.

Donald found deep joy in caring for his land and watching wildlife pass through it. A faithful and loyal husband, he took great pleasure in working side by side with Rose throughout their life together. He passed away at home after a day spent doing what he loved—working on the land that meant so much to him.

A funeral service will be held on Saturday, January 24, at 11:00 a.m. at Community Bible Church, 602 Chenango Street, Binghamton. The family will receive friends on Saturday at 10:00 am until the time of the service.

Barclays has said it has initiated plans to relocate its European headquarters from Dublin to Paris.

The banking giant said it was “confident this is the right step forward” in its efforts to be strategically closer to growing markets.

The move from the Irish to the French capital is not likely to be completed until the first half of 2027, and is subject to approval by regulators.

It is understood to be expected to have a minimal impact on staff in Ireland.

Barclays shifted billions of pounds worth of assets to Dublin and increased the size of its workforce in the city in the wake of Brexit.

But it first raised the possibility in 2023 of it relocating the European base to Paris which has blossomed into a trading hub for the bank.

The shift is expected to bring the bulk of its decision-making closer to the majority of its investment banking activity on the continent.

Francesco Ceccato, the chief executive of Barclays Europe, described the move as a “strategic milestone” that will help it better meet the needs of its clients.

“After extensive discussions at all levels of the organisation, we are confident this is the right step forward – both for the entity and for our clients,” he said.

“We are very excited about the opportunities ahead.”

The round is expected to total around $50 billion, but the numbers could change and term sheets have not been signed, according to a source familiar with the discussions who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. Bloomberg was first to report the discussions.

OpenAI kickstarted the AI boom by launching its artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, and has since become one of the fastest growing commercial entities on the planet. The company has raised billions of dollars from investors as it's worked to scale and develop new models and roll out new features.
