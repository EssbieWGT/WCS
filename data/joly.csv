OpenAI is reportedly paying its employees more than any major tech startup, showering workers with an average of $1.5 million each in stock-based compensation — a staggering sum that amounts to nearly half of the company’s projected 2025 revenue.

The unusually rich payouts, disclosed in financial materials reviewed by investors, put OpenAI far ahead of peers, with stock compensation averaging more than seven times what Google paid employees before its 2004 IPO and roughly 34 times the average at other major tech companies ahead of their public debuts.

The largesse reflects OpenAI’s aggressive push to retain top artificial-intelligence talent as competition intensifies, with equity awards swelling operating losses and rapidly diluting existing shareholders, according to the investor materials obtained by the Wall Street Journal.

Across its roughly 4,000-person workforce, the equity payouts translate into one of the most expensive payrolls Silicon Valley has ever seen, with OpenAI’s stock-based compensation projected to climb by about $3 billion a year through 2030, the data shows.

The spending surge accelerated after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg began dangling nine-figure — and in some cases, billion-dollar — pay packages to poach elite AI researchers, triggering defections from OpenAI and forcing the company to sweeten retention bonuses.

The recruiting battle intensified over the summer after Meta’s hiring blitz lured away more than 20 OpenAI employees, including a co-creator of ChatGPT, prompting the startup to issue one-time bonuses worth millions of dollars to some research and engineering staff.

The generous pay has come as OpenAI races to defend its position in generative AI — even as the equity-heavy compensation inflates losses and reportedly pushes stock-based pay to about 46% of projected revenue in 2025, the highest level among major tech startups analyzed.

OpenAI recently told employees it would scrap a policy requiring them to stay at the company for at least six months before equity begins vesting — a move that could further drive up compensation as workers gain faster access to lucrative stock awards, according to The Journal.

OpenAI’s pay structure dwarfs that of most large tech companies, which traditionally spend about 6% of revenue on stock compensation in the year before their IPOs, according to data compiled by Equilar.

Google spent about 15% of revenue on stock-based compensation ahead of its 2004 IPO, while Facebook’s figure was roughly 6% before it went public in 2012, according to data compiled by the Journal.

Founded in 2015 as a nonprofit, OpenAI initially rejected profit motives altogether.

That stance shifted in 2019, when the company created a capped-profit subsidiary to attract outside investment. OpenAI justified its decision at the time by arguing that the cost of advanced AI research had grown too large to sustain through philanthropy alone.

The evolution accelerated in recent years as OpenAI sought ever-larger funding rounds to finance the growing costs of large-scale AI research.

After public backlash, legal threats and internal debate, the company completed a restructuring earlier this year that left it operating under a hybrid model. Its commercial arm now functions as a public benefit corporation, while the original nonprofit foundation retains control and a significant equity stake.

Here's one key takeaway. Eli Lilly isn't content with its dominance in the weight management market. True, this area will be its biggest growth driver for the foreseeable future. But several things could go wrong.

As unlikely as it may seem at present, another drugmaker could potentially steal a significant market share from Eli Lilly within its core therapeutic area. And, of course, the company's top medicines, currently under patent exclusivity, will eventually lose their exclusivity -- although that's far into the future.

Or its amazing drug discovery engine could stop producing breakthrough GLP-1 therapies. This is essentially what happened to Novo Nordisk. Although it had what appeared to be a secure lead in the GLP-1 category, from which it generated almost all of its revenue, several clinical setbacks, coupled with competition from Eli Lilly, led to worsening financial results and a decline in market share for the Denmark-based drugmaker.

Eli Lilly is considering all these risks and planning accordingly, and doing so years in advance. That's also why the pharmaceutical giant has been making a push in oncology. And why it is building an artificial intelligence supercomputer that could help it develop medicines much faster and at lower costs.

Meanwhile, Eli Lilly's financial results are strong, something that should remain the case at least through the next few years. Between that and the solid foundation it is laying for the future, Eli Lilly's shares look attractive, whether or not the acquisition of Abivax happens.

The final quarter of 2025 introduced a new layer of complexity: a 43-day government shutdown that paralyzed federal data reporting.
The central bank is now balancing a cooling but resilient labor market against ""sticky"" inflation that has refused to drop below 2.7%.
However, if the labor market finally begins to show the cracks that many feared during the government shutdown, the dollar’s rollercoaster may have many more drops ahead.","As the final trading bells of 2025 ring out across Wall Street, the US Dollar is staging a defiant last-minute stand. After a year defined by dizzying volatility—ranging from a massive early-year surge to a historic mid-summer slump—the greenback is closing December on a high note. This eleventh-hour advance, fueled by surprisingly resilient labor data and a fractured Federal Reserve, has provided a stabilizing ""impulse"" to a currency that spent much of the year in a state of freefall.

The immediate implications are significant for both Main Street and the C-suite. While the US Dollar Index (DXY) is set to finish the year down approximately 9.5%, its recent rebound from October lows suggests that the narrative of ""US exceptionalism"" isn't entirely dead. For investors, the year-end strength offers a reprieve from the currency's broader 2025 decline, though it complicates the outlook for 2026 as the market grapples with a labor market that refuses to break and a central bank deeply divided on its next move.

A Year of Policy Shocks and Labor Market Resilience

The story of the US Dollar in 2025 is one of two distinct halves. The year began with the DXY at multi-year highs near 110.00, driven by aggressive expectations of new trade tariffs and fiscal stimulus. However, this momentum evaporated in April following a chaotic ""policy horror show."" An executive order for reciprocal tariffs on April 2 initially spooked global markets, only to be followed by a ""Tariff Time-Out"" (TTO) on April 8. This policy whiplash triggered a massive sell-off in the dollar as investors pivoted toward a more cautious global outlook. By July 1, the DXY had plummeted to 96.37, marking its worst first-half performance since the 1970s.

The final quarter of 2025 introduced a new layer of complexity: a 43-day government shutdown that paralyzed federal data reporting. This delay pushed the critical November Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report into mid-December, creating a vacuum of information that initially weighed on the dollar. When the data was finally released on December 16, it revealed a surprisingly robust 155,000 jobs added, far exceeding the pessimistic forecasts of a sub-100k print. This ""better-than-feared"" outcome was punctuated today, December 31, by initial jobless claims falling to 199,000—the third consecutive weekly decline.

This late-year data blitz has allowed the dollar to claw back ground. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, has been the primary architect of the dollar's wider annual decline. Despite three 25-basis-point rate cuts in the second half of the year, the December FOMC meeting revealed a significant internal rift. The 9–3 vote to cut rates to a range of 3.50%–3.75% was the most contentious in years, with hawks pointing to ""sticky"" inflation—driven by earlier tariff-related price shocks—as a reason to halt further easing. This hawkish dissent provided the fundamental floor for the dollar’s year-end rally.

Multinationals Win Big as Domestic Sectors Lag

The broader 2025 decline of the US Dollar has been a boon for American multinationals, which generate a significant portion of their revenue abroad. As the dollar weakened throughout the summer and autumn, foreign earnings became more valuable when converted back into USD, providing a tailwind for some of the world’s largest companies.

Tech giants have been the primary beneficiaries of this trend. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) both reported substantial revenue boosts in their late-year earnings calls, citing favorable currency translation as a key driver of their beat-and-raise quarters. Similarly, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) saw its cloud margins benefit from a weaker dollar, which made its services more price-competitive in European and Asian markets. In the consumer space, PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) raised its annual forecast mid-year, explicitly noting that the dollar's slump helped offset the rising costs of raw materials linked to trade policies.

However, the ""winners"" circle was not universal. Domestic-focused sectors, such as regional banking and real estate, found little relief in the dollar's decline. For companies like Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE: EW), the year was a lesson in hedging; the company’s CFO noted that they successfully reversed nearly $100 million in expected currency headwinds, turning them into tailwinds by the third quarter. Conversely, companies like Levi Strauss & Co. (NYSE: LEVI) had to navigate a complex environment where the benefits of a weaker dollar on international sales were partially offset by the increased cost of imported textiles due to the year's earlier tariff volatility.

Breaking the ""Invincible"" Dollar Narrative

The wider significance of 2025 lies in the shattering of the ""invincible dollar"" narrative that dominated the early 2020s. The year’s performance fits into a broader trend of global ""de-dollarization"" fears and a shift toward a multi-polar currency regime. The 10% annual retreat suggests that the market is no longer willing to price in US exceptionalism at any cost, especially when fiscal deficits remain at record levels and trade policy remains unpredictable.

Historically, the volatility of 2025 echoes the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973, where a sudden shift in policy led to a prolonged period of dollar weakness. The ""Tariff Time-Out"" of April 2025 may be remembered as a similar turning point, where the limits of using the dollar as a geopolitical lever were laid bare. The ripple effects have been felt most acutely by trading partners in the Eurozone and Japan, who spent much of the year grappling with the inflationary pressures of their own strengthening currencies against the greenback.

From a policy perspective, the 2025 rollercoaster has forced the Federal Reserve into a corner. The central bank is now balancing a cooling but resilient labor market against ""sticky"" inflation that has refused to drop below 2.7%. This internal friction suggests that the ""Fed Put""—the idea that the central bank will always step in to support the economy with lower rates—is becoming more expensive to maintain.

The Path to 2026: Stability or a New Slide?

Looking ahead to 2026, the short-term outlook for the dollar depends heavily on whether the December rally is a trend reversal or merely a ""dead cat bounce."" If the labor market remains as tight as the year-end jobless claims suggest, the Fed may be forced to pause its rate-cutting cycle earlier than the market expects. This could provide a sustained boost to the dollar, potentially pushing the DXY back toward the 100.00 level in the first quarter of the new year.

However, long-term challenges remain. The structural issues of 2025—high fiscal spending and trade uncertainty—have not been resolved. Strategic pivots will be required from corporate treasurers, who must now decide whether to lock in hedges at these slightly higher year-end rates or bet on a continued long-term decline. Market opportunities may emerge in emerging market currencies, which have been suppressed by the late-December USD strength but remain fundamentally undervalued if the US economy slows in 2026.

A Year of Lessons for Investors

In summary, 2025 was the year the US Dollar finally met its match in the form of domestic policy shifts and a cooling global appetite for USD-denominated assets. The year-end rally, while impressive in its timing, does not erase the fact that the dollar has lost nearly a tenth of its value over the last twelve months. The key takeaway for investors is that the currency market has entered a new era of high-frequency volatility where labor data and ""sticky"" inflation are the primary drivers of value.

As we move into 2026, the market will be watching the Federal Reserve’s internal divisions closely. If the hawkish minority becomes the majority, the dollar could see a resurgence. However, if the labor market finally begins to show the cracks that many feared during the government shutdown, the dollar’s rollercoaster may have many more drops ahead. For now, the greenback ends the year bruised but standing, a testament to the enduring, if diminished, resilience of the American economy.

Despite the definitive collapse of its $24.6 billion tie-up with Kroger (NYSE: KR) late last year, a growing chorus of Wall Street analysts is doubling down on the grocer. Maintaining ""Strong Buy"" ratings, these experts argue that the market has fundamentally mispriced the company’s standalone value, ignoring a robust ""Plan B"" that prioritizes aggressive shareholder returns and digital transformation over raw scale.

The immediate implications for Albertsons are twofold: the company is now a leaner, more focused entity, yet it continues to grapple with the ""merger hangover""—a combination of suppressed valuation multiples and significant margin pressures from a shifting sales mix. While the broader retail sector has faced headwinds, Albertsons’ current trading price of approximately $17.50 represents a steep discount to its intrinsic value, which some analysts peg as high as $40.00 per share. This valuation gap has turned the stock into a premier ""value recovery"" play for 2026, even as the company navigates a complex legal battle to extract billions in damages from its former suitor.

The Regulatory Block and the Pivot to Independence

The saga that defined Albertsons for over three years reached its climax in December 2024, when a U.S. District Court in Oregon granted the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) request for a preliminary injunction. The ruling effectively killed the Kroger merger, with the court citing concerns that the deal would stifle competition, harm union bargaining power, and lead to higher grocery prices for consumers. This decision followed a timeline that began in October 2022, when the two giants first announced their intent to merge. Over the subsequent 26 months, the companies proposed various divestiture plans—including the sale of nearly 600 stores to C&S Wholesale Grocers—but regulators remained unconvinced that a third party could effectively replicate the competitive pressure of a standalone Albertsons.

In the wake of the deal's termination, the relationship between the two grocery titans soured rapidly. Albertsons promptly filed a lawsuit against Kroger for breach of contract, alleging that Kroger failed to exhaust ""any and all actions"" to secure regulatory approval. As of late 2025, this litigation remains a central catalyst for the stock, with Albertsons seeking a multi-billion dollar payout in addition to the $600 million termination fee already owed. This legal maneuver, combined with the company’s immediate pivot to a $2 billion share buyback program and a significant dividend hike, signaled to the market that management was no longer waiting for a ""white knight"" and was instead focused on unlocking value from within.

Winners and Losers in the New Grocery Landscape

The failure of the merger has reshuffled the deck for the entire grocery industry. The primary winners appear to be Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), which have continued to gain market share as the two largest traditional grocers were distracted by years of litigation and integration planning. These retail behemoths have used their massive scale to maintain price leadership, putting further pressure on Albertsons to invest in ""value pricing"" to keep its customer base loyal. Conversely, C&S Wholesale Grocers emerged as a notable loser, missing out on a transformative acquisition of 579 stores that would have instantly elevated it to a top-tier national player.

For Kroger (NYSE: KR), the fallout has been strategic. The loss of the merger means Kroger must now find alternative ways to compete with Walmart’s data capabilities and Amazon’s logistics. For Albertsons, however, the ""loser"" label initially applied by the market is being challenged. While its stock price took a hit following the FTC injunction, the company's ""Year of Investment"" in 2025 has begun to bear fruit. By retaining its most profitable stores—which would have been divested in the merger—Albertsons has preserved its core cash flow, allowing it to fund a $1.5 billion productivity program that analysts from RBC Capital Markets (NYSE: RY) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) believe will stabilize margins by mid-2026.

Industry Trends and the Margin Conundrum

The ""Strong Buy"" thesis for Albertsons exists in tension with real margin pressures. The company has seen its gross margins compressed by nearly 80 basis points over the last year, driven largely by a shift in sales mix. The explosion in popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs has boosted pharmacy sales, which carry lower margins than traditional groceries. Additionally, the rapid growth of digital sales—now accounting for nearly 10% of total revenue—comes with higher fulfillment costs. These trends are not unique to Albertsons; they reflect a broader industry shift where ""the box"" (the physical store) is becoming a multi-purpose hub for health, e-commerce, and advertising.

To combat these pressures, Albertsons has leaned into the ""Retail Media"" trend. The Albertsons Media Collective has become a high-margin revenue stream, leveraging first-party shopper data to sell targeted advertising to consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands. This high-margin income is crucial for offsetting the thinning margins in the aisles. Furthermore, the company’s aggressive push into automation—with 30% of its distribution volume slated for automated systems by the end of 2025—represents a historical precedent in the sector. Much like the industry's shift toward self-checkout a decade ago, this move toward back-end automation is seen as the only viable path to maintaining profitability in a high-wage, inflationary environment.

The Road to 2026: Strategic Pivots and Scenarios

Looking ahead, the short-term outlook for Albertsons is dominated by its capital allocation strategy. With a $2 billion buyback authorization in place and a $750 million accelerated program launched in the fourth quarter of 2025, the company is effectively ""buying its own recovery."" Analysts at UBS (NYSE: UBS) suggest that if Albertsons can successfully capture even a fraction of the damages sought in its lawsuit against Kroger, the company could potentially retire up to 15% of its outstanding shares, providing a massive boost to earnings per share (EPS) even if organic growth remains modest.

The long-term scenario involves a potential monetization of the company's real estate. Albertsons owns a property portfolio valued at roughly $14.3 billion—nearly equivalent to its entire market capitalization. While management has resisted a full-scale sale-leaseback program to date, the ""hidden value"" of these assets provides a significant safety net for investors. Should the company face a prolonged downturn, these assets could be tapped to fund further dividends or debt reduction. The most likely outcome for 2026 is a steady re-rating of the stock as it proves its ability to grow digital and pharmacy sales without sacrificing the bottom line.

A Value Play Hidden in Plain Sight

The story of Albertsons in 2025 is one of resilience and a stark disconnect between market perception and fundamental reality. While the ""complex regulatory environment"" effectively blocked its path to a merger, it also forced the company to refine its standalone strategy. The key takeaway for investors is that Albertsons is no longer a speculative merger play; it is a disciplined value stock trading at roughly 5x projected EBITDA—a valuation usually reserved for companies in terminal decline, not those with 20% digital growth and a multi-billion dollar real estate backstop.

Moving forward, the market will be watching for stabilization in grocery margins and the first major rulings in the Kroger litigation. If Albertsons can demonstrate that its productivity program is successfully offsetting labor and pharmacy costs, the ""Strong Buy"" ratings currently seen as contrarian may soon become the consensus. For now, the grocer remains a compelling example of how regulatory setbacks can sometimes pave the way for a more focused and shareholder-friendly corporate evolution.

(“HPQ” or the “Company”) (TSX-V: HPQ, OTCQB: HPQFF, FRA: O08), a technology company driving innovation in advanced materials and critical process development, released a year-end corporate update summarizing a year defined by decisive strategic realignment, deep technical validation, and tangible progress toward near-term revenue generation across its core technology platforms.

Building on the success of its R&D work in 2025, HPQ is shifting towards a more focused, execution-oriented strategy centered on the commercialization of technologies offering strong market relevance and scalable economics.

“2025 was the year in which HPQ moved from broad technology development to a focused commercial intent,” said Bernard Tourillon, Chairman, President, and CEO of HPQ Silicon. “We spent the year aligning the company around platforms that can generate value in the foreseeable future, while maintaining the technical integrity that has always defined HPQ. That balance is not easy, but it is necessary.”

Fumed Silica Reactor: A streamlined alternative to legacy fumed silica manufacturing routes

In 2025, the Fumed Silica Reactor (FSR), developed in partnership with PyroGenesis through HPQ Silica Polvere Inc [1], emerged as one of HPQ’s two most advanced technology platforms. Over the course of the year, the project progressed from pilot commissioning to meaningful industrial validation.

Key achievements included:

Successful production of fumed silica at pilot scale

Independent confirmation of morphological equivalence to commercial material

Achievement of commercial material surface areas assessed under BET testing protocols

Progress toward semi-continuous operation and throughput optimization

Collectively, these results supported HPQ’s core technical premise: that fumed silica can be produced in a single step using a lower-energy, lower-carbon plasma-based process, offering a streamlined alternative to legacy manufacturing routes that have historically relied on complex, capital-intensive, and environmentally challenging multi-step processes.

“What mattered to us in 2025 was demonstrating, step by step, that the reactor performs at scale in line with theoretical models and laboratory results,” said Bernard Tourillon. “Reaching that point changes the nature of the discussion—from whether the technology works to how fast can it be deployed.”

With global demand for fumed silica expanding across batteries, advanced materials, energy systems, and increasingly datacenter and AI-driven infrastructure, HPQ believes its timing and positioning are converging.

“Fumed silica is rapidly becoming a strategic material,” added Tourillon. “It’s growing role in energy storage, electronics, and next-generation computing is expected to drive demand well beyond the capacity of today’s manufacturing infrastructure. The FSR directly addresses this gap by enabling a purpose-built production pathway designed for scale, rather than incremental refinement of legacy, multi-step processes.”

Battery Materials: Advancing from Laboratory Validation to Commercial Production

During 2025, HPQ advanced its silicon-based anode materials initiative, developed through its strategic partnership with Novacium SAS, which emerged as HPQ’s second most commercially advanced technology platform.

In the first half of the year, Novacium’s GEN3 silicon-based anode materials, deployed in commercially sized 18650 lithium-ion lab scale cells, achieved a key performance milestone by sustaining high-capacity retention beyond 1,000 charge cycles. This performance exceeded that of leading commercial graphite-based cells by at least 30%.

These independently validated results confirmed both the material’s seamless integration potential within existing lithium-ion battery manufacturing processes and its measurable performance advantages over conventional graphite-only anode systems—marking a significant step toward commercial production readiness.

In the second half of 2025, HPQ and its technology partner Novacium SAS advanced the silicon-based anode materials initiative beyond laboratory and materials validation into commercial-scale lithium-ion cell manufacturing. This phase included the production of commercially sized 18650 (4,000 mAh) and 21700 (6,000 mAh) cells incorporating GEN3 silicon-based anode materials.

These activities culminated in the launch of the HPQ ENDURA+ battery platform, and the successful completion of the certifications required for commercial distribution. Collectively, these milestones validated HPQ’s core premise that its silicon-based anode materials can be integrated into existing battery manufacturing architectures and scaled into commercially qualified products—marking a clear transition from upstream materials development to downstream industrial and commercial execution.

In September 2025, HPQ received strong third-party validation of its silicon-based anode materials initiative through the award of up to $3 million in funding from the Government of Canada. The funding was granted under the Battery Industry Acceleration call for proposals of the Energy Innovation Program, administered by Natural Resources Canada.

This investment is intended to support capital expenditures and accelerate the construction of HPQ’s first continuous production system, designed for an initial capacity of 50 tonnes per year, to manufacture silicon-based anode materials for lithium-ion batteries developed in collaboration with its technology partner Novacium SAS.

“What we demonstrated in 2025 was not incremental improvement, but execution across the full battery value chain,” said Bernard Tourillon. “From independently validated GEN3 anode performance to commercial-format cell manufacturing, certification, and now government-supported scale-up, we have methodically removed the key barriers between materials innovation and commercial production. This is the transition point where battery materials stop being a R&D project and become an industrial product.”

Hydrogen-Based Initiatives: Expanding Strategic Optionality Toward Commercialization

During 2025, Novacium SAS continued to advance the development and scale-up of its autonomous hydrogen production platform, METAGENE™, alongside its waste-to-energy technology. This process is designed to convert industrial by-products, such as black dross, into hydrogen and other recoverable value-added outputs.

Leveraging HPQ’s exclusive North American license (Canada, the United States, and Mexico) for Novacium’s technologies, together with its 28.4% equity interest in Novacium, these initiatives further broaden HPQ’s strategic optionality by extending its technology portfolio beyond advanced silicon materials for batteries into clean hydrogen production and circular-economy applications, with a focus on scalability and long-term commercial relevance.

While these initiatives remained at earlier stages of commercialization in 2025, the work completed during the year confirmed both their technical viability and strategic relevance, particularly for decentralized energy systems and industrial hydrogen applications. 2026 is expected to be a year in which the commercial potential of these platforms begins to become more apparent.

“These platforms give HPQ strategic optionality,” said Tourillon. “But optionality only has value when it is pursued with discipline. In 2025, our role was to advance these technologies responsibly, while maintaining a clear focus on executing our primary commercialization priorities.”

Strategic Discipline: Increased Focus on the Commercialization of Novacium Technologies

Novacium SAS is a privately held French technology company founded in 2022. It operates as an engineering and research-and-development company focused on energy-related materials, with activities centered on silicon-based materials and hydrogen systems. Since its formation, Novacium has developed an extensive portfolio of intellectual property relating to its technology platforms.

Novacium is presently advancing the development of the following technology platforms:

Silicon-based anode materials intended for use in lithium-ion batteries, with the objective of improving energy density while remaining compatible with existing industrial manufacturing processes.

A hydrogen-generation system based on a proprietary silicon–aluminum alloy, designed to produce hydrogen on demand without reliance on external power sources. This technology is being evaluated for potential decentralized and mobile applications.

A waste-to-energy process intended to convert industrial by-products, including black dross, into hydrogen and other recoverable materials.

Based on the results to date, Novacium’s activities are now more focused on engineering optimization, and scale-up assessment.

HPQ management’s evaluation of the potential future applications of Novacium’s technologies contributed to the Company’s decision at the start of 2025 to increase its equity interest in Novacium. This investment is part of our strategy to strengthen long-term strategic alignment and increase HPQ’s exposure to battery materials, hydrogen-related technologies, and recycling-oriented processes.

As North American commercialization pathways for certain Novacium technologies became a clearer area of focus during later part of 2025, HPQ and Novacium clarified their exclusive licensing agreement. The amendments were intended to clarify the scope, duration, and key terms governing existing and potential future commercial licenses that may be granted to HPQ or its subsidiaries.

“Our increased investment in Novacium reflects management’s assessment of the technical progress achieved to date and the potential relevance of these technologies within HPQ’s broader strategy,” said Bernard Tourillon, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of HPQ Silicon Inc. “As Novacium’s programs mature, our focus is on disciplined engineering optimization and evaluating scalable commercialization pathways in North America, while maintaining a prudent and structured approach to execution.”

Strategic Discipline: Concluding the QRR Program

As part of its year-end strategic review, HPQ determined that the Quartz Reduction Reactor (“QRR”) silicon metal program, while technically successful, was not sufficiently aligned with the Company’s short- and medium-term commercialization objectives. Management concluded that the capital and resources required to continue advancing the QRR program could be more effectively allocated to initiatives with clearer and faster potential commercialization timelines. As a result, the Company decided to formally conclude development of the QRR program.

This decision reflects a disciplined reassessment of capital allocation priorities, development timelines, and the overall risk–reward profile of the project portfolio.

“The QRR was, and remains, an interesting technology,” said Bernard Tourillon, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of HPQ Silicon Inc. “However, as a development-stage company, we must continuously assess where our capital can be deployed most effectively. The cost and time profile associated with silicon metal production no longer aligned with our objective of accelerating commercialization and progressing toward revenue generation.”

He added:

“Concluding a program is not a failure. In some cases, it is a necessary and responsible decision to ensure focus and execution discipline.”

Positioning for 2026: From Transition to Execution

HPQ exits 2025 with a more focused portfolio, multiple technologies that have progressed through key validation stages, and an increasingly defined operational roadmap. During the year, the Company completed financing activities without excessive dilution and strengthened strategic partnerships.

“2025 was a year of transition toward revenue generating-oriented activities,” Tourillon concluded. “Our efforts during the year were directed toward establishing the conditions required for execution. As we enter 2026, management’s focus is on advancing technologies that have reached appropriate levels of readiness, evaluating commercial scale-up opportunities in response to market interest, and seeking to translate technical progress into sustainable long-term value for our shareholders.”

NewPrinces S.p.A. ha perfezionato l’acquisizione del 100% di Plasmon laid down by the controllata italiana di The Kraft Heinz Company, Heinz Italia, portando a termine l’operazione annunciata last July 9. Il closing si è chiuso con un purchase price finale di 124,3 milioni di euro, interamente corrisposti in contanti. Il perimetro dell’acquisizione include l’intera piattaforma industriale e commerciale del baby food e della nutrizione specializzata, insieme a marchi storici come Plasmon, Nipiol, BiAglut, Aproten e Dieterba e allo stabilimento produttivo di Latina.

Nel 2024 il business ha generato ricavi per about 170 million euro e un EBITDA pari a 17 milioni. Per Kraft Heinz, l’operazione rappresenta un passo coerente con la strategia di rifocalizzazione sulla piattaforma Taste Elevation, con un’attenzione crescente ai marchi Heinz e Kraft, che in Italia continuano a mostrare una crescita solida sia nel canale retail sia nell’away from home.

La visione strategica di NewPrinces

Per NewPrinces, l’operazione segna un passaggio chiave nel rafforzamento della presenza nei segmenti ad alta marginalità. “Il perfezionamento di questa Operazione rappresenta il compimento di una visione strategica di lungo periodo” ha commentato il presidente Angelo Mastrolia. ""Riportare in Italia marchi come Plasmon, Nipiol, BiAglut, Aproten e Dieterba, profondamente radicati nell’identità del nostro Paese, insieme a uno stabilimento produttivo altamente efficiente come quello di Latina, rafforza la nostra posizione quale piattaforma di riferimento nel segmento ad alta marginalità degli alimenti per l’infanzia e della nutrizione specializzata in Italia e in Europa”. L’obiettivo dichiarato è ora l’integrazione industriale e commerciale del perimetro Plasmon, facendo leva sulle sinergie con le attività già presenti nel gruppo per generare valore lungo tutta la filiera.

Plasmon, marchio storico e asset industriale

Fondato a Milano nel 1902, Plasmon è uno dei marchi alimentari più riconoscibili del Paese ed è registrato come Marchio Storico di Interesse Nazionale. Leader nel baby food in Italia, domina categorie come biscotti, puree, cereali e snack ed è forte di una fiducia consolidata presso famiglie e operatori sanitari. Al centro dell’operazione c’è anche lo stabilimento di Latina, sito ad alta capacità che produce circa 1,8 miliardi di biscotti Plasmon l’anno e impiega circa 300 addetti. L’attività proseguirà senza discontinuità sotto la nuova proprietà e continuerà a produrre per Heinz Baby Food destinato al mercato UK tramite un accordo di co-packing.

“Riteniamo che il business sia ben posizionato per proseguire il proprio percorso di sviluppo sotto la guida del Gruppo NewPrinces, leader nel settore food & beverage e partner ideale per la crescita di questi marchi storici” ha evidenziato l’ad di Kraft Heinz Italia Carmela Bazzarelli. “Kraft Heinz ribadisce il proprio impegno in Italia, dove continuerà a focalizzarsi sulla crescita della piattaforma Taste Elevation con i marchi Kraft e HEINZ, supportata da nuovi investimenti e da una maggiore focalizzazione strategica resa possibile da questa Operazione”.

Integrazione, sinergie e nuova struttura operativa

Il razionale industriale dell’operazione punta alla creazione di una piattaforma paneuropea integrata nel baby food. Lo stabilimento di Latina, specializzato in biscotti, puree e pouch, è complementare a quello di Ozzano Taro, focalizzato su latte liquido e formule per l’infanzia. Secondo le stime del management, l’integrazione potrà sostenere una revenue growth di Plasmon con un CAGR di circa il 3% e un progressivo miglioramento del margine EBITDA fino al 15%.

From 1 Jan. 2026 tutte le attività operative di Plasmon saranno trasferite a Princes Italia S.p.A. tramite un affitto di ramo d’azienda, con un canone annuo di 3 milioni di euro più una componente variabile pari all’1,5% dei ricavi.",https://www.firstonline.info/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Plasmon.webp,N,,2025-12-31 11:59:52.877689

Uh, uh if you look at Oracle, on the surface, um the financial statements show significant growth in the earnings.

We've seen this recent sell off. What do you make of that? Is OpenAI's inability or ability to pay a major risk to Oracle moving forward?

It is indeed a major risk and thank you very much for having me. I I do believe it's a major risk. Open AI according to Microsoft's financial statements, um is losing around $12 billion a quarter and their financial disclosures are not very transparent. And as the as Oracle's largest uh customer, essentially they could be a source of risk. Um one of the biggest component of Capex that Oracle has is building data centers for uh that are contracted with OpenAI and an open question would be in case there's a failure to pay by OpenAI, how can those data centers be repurposed?

Ali, how do investors assess this long-term potential of AI while also taking into consideration the risks on their near-term balance sheet?

I do think that looking at balance sheets actually is a good place to start. Uh, uh if you look at Oracle, on the surface, um the financial statements show significant growth in the earnings. But if you look at the details of those earnings, the earning growth was come from a non- recurring item, which was a sale of a venture that they had with Softbank. and that was that contributed roughly two and a half billion dollars to their earnings. If you take that thought, Oracle is essentially operating income is growing at a fairly respectable 12 to 15%, which is again very good number in and of itself, but it is not the explosive growth that would justify equity valuation to move higher. And another factor that is impacting equity, and that's really like where my interest in Oracle is is on the credit side. If you look at credit spreads, uh Oracle's credit spreads are moving wider and wider because their CAPEX has gone from $6 billion over the prior six months period to a $20 billion. and that's a significant growth in CAPEX that is being funded by credit.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hxWBBdA8CI8mazSioaVGvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/bb5281f0-e5c5-11f0-b7b3-3182b7bd510b,N,,2025-12-31 11:01:56.661980

Hilma Cooper remembers both houses from her girlhood in Knoxville.
Abbie Billings Brewster, a widow for most of her adult life, owned the Brewster House next door.
The Glover House was built in the mid-1820s, and was known in its early years as the Alba House, after the original owner and builder Aaron Alba.
Abbie Billings Brewster was also a granddaughter of Silas Billings.","Books come in all shapes, sizes, and ages, as do the libraries that house them. Think the little, street-side, take-a-book/leave-a-book stands that have popped up all over the place during the past few years, then consider the grandeur of the twin marble lions (their names are Patience and Fortitude, and they’re over 100 years old) serving as sentinels at the steps of the New York Public Library on 5th Avenue and 42nd Street.

The Knoxville Public Library at 112 East Main Street doesn’t have a pair of lions, but it does have a pair of houses—the Glover House and the Brewster House. They each have their own kind of grandeur, and they were always neighbors, but became physically connected just a couple of years ago. They have a combined age of about three centuries, and are themselves literally full of history.

Hilma Cooper remembers both houses from her girlhood in Knoxville. The Glover House belonged to her Uncle Ed and Aunt Jane Glover; Uncle Ed was an attorney, a Civil War enthusiast, and author of local history, and Aunt Jane was a librarian for the Knoxville Public Library and “quite a talented chef,” Hilma says. Abbie Billings Brewster, a widow for most of her adult life, owned the Brewster House next door.

“I knew her as a child,” Hilma says. “She was kind of a fixture in the town.”

Eugene Seelye, a Knoxville historian and author, describes Abbie Billings Brewster as “a very prim and proper lady” who always wore a hat and gloves. Her elegant home had a ballroom on the third floor (more on that later).

Ron Meinstereifel is the historian and museum coordinator for the extensive and eclectic collection of mostly Knoxville-related artifacts and memorabilia that have found a home in the Glover House.

“The neatest thing about the town is that the people preserved things,” Ron says. A houseful of things. There’s a train room with a model of the borough when it boasted two trains and two train stations, a textile room, a military room, an education room, a genealogy room, a music room—you get the idea. A retired psychologist who says he “needed something to do,” Ron has been spending his days unpacking boxes, making discoveries, and sharing what he’s learned about Knoxville’s history.

The Glover House was built in the mid-1820s, and was known in its early years as the Alba House, after the original owner and builder Aaron Alba. It’s a structural marvel, with the original pine beams and sections of the stone foundation remaining—and doing their jobs—in the cellar. The walls supporting the well-crafted rooms are still straight and sturdy. Alba family members lived there until 1886, when the home was sold to Hiram P. Gilbert and his wife, Carrie Bell Billings Gilbert, who was a granddaughter of Silas Billings, one of Knoxville’s earliest businessmen. Abbie Billings Brewster was also a granddaughter of Silas Billings. In 1898, ownership of the home passed to Carrie Gilbert’s mother, Helena S. Billings. She died ten years later, and the house went to her daughter, Jessie K. Beach, and then to her daughter, Ruth Gee, who would have been Silas Billings’ great, great, granddaughter.

Uncle Ed (1908-1996) and Aunt Jane Glover (1916-2009), as they were known to Hilma and her cousin, Brian Edgcomb (who passed away in April 2025), bought the home in the 1940s. The house was willed to Hilma and Brian, eventually donated by them to the library, and later became the museum.

The Brewster House has been home to the library since 1957. The library was founded in 1921, and its original home was on the second floor of the town hall on Case Street. In 1947, Mrs. Ethel Ashton provided the means for the library to purchase and renovate the Episcopal Chapel on Main Street for its use. Mrs. Ashton died in 1955 and, via her bequest, the library was able to purchase the Brewster House from Ernest Billings Brewster, Jr., grandson of Horace and Abbie Brewster.

Horace Brewster was a successful hotelier in San Diego. Eugene, the Knoxville historian who now lives in Wellsboro, writes that Horace and Abbie were married in Elmira in 1890 at her parents’ home. They went to California to live, but eventually returned to Knoxville. Horace built the Queen Anne-style house in 1910; its grand interior included a graceful staircase, carved newel posts with rose-shaded gaslights (they’ve since been electrified), pocket doors, turret room, chandeliers, and a third-floor ballroom.

That ballroom space, complete with tables, tablecloths, and seating that hearkens back to an earlier century, is now available to rent—maybe for a shower or a tea, or some other small get-together. The adjoining turret room, accessible through a hobbit-sized passage, has a view of Main Street. It’s a cozy spot where it’s easy to envision curling up with a good book. Hilma says she remembers when she first saw the room it had college banners in it, so maybe there were some other activities going on there, too.

Improvements and renovations were made to the library about thirteen years ago. Then, after the Glover estate was settled and the house came into the library’s possession, the project to connect the two homes was conceived. As part of the Glover’s commitment to their community, the estate had established the Deerfield Charitable Trust (deerfieldcharitabletrust.com) in 2010. Through that entity the money was made available for the project, which included, in addition to connecting the homes, adding a children’s library/play area, a mezzanine overlooking that section (a great place to sit and read), creation of the museum in the Glover House, and infrastructure improvements.

“Everyone is really excited about the space,” says Erin Cook, library director, of the new children’s area. “A big part of libraries is community.”

“I’m delighted with the way it’s being used now,” says Hilma, adding that it’s still possible to be in the home that was her uncle and aunt’s “and see how it used to be.”

Cheryl Edgcomb, Brian’s wife, has, since her husband’s death, found herself in possession of an abundance of family and community history. She laughs when she tells Ron that “this is all documents and things I’ll be donating to you.”

The DR Automobiles Group recently announced that it had acquired the historic Italian brand, which wrote some of the most important chapters in the country’s automotive history more than a century ago.

The goal is to have the new Itala brand up and running by the end of 2026. It's unclear exactly what the DR Group has planned for this historic name, but there's hope that Itala will become a serious luxury car player in Europe over the next few years.

But in order to appreciate the symbolic weight of Itala's unlikely comeback, it’s worth looking back at one of the most fascinating stories from the early days of Italian motoring.

The Origins

1907 Itala 120 HP

Photo by: RM Sotheby's

Founded in Turin in 1903 by Matteo Ceirano, Itala was born in the heart of Italy’s first automotive industrial district. From the start, it distinguished itself through exceptional build quality and forward-thinking engineering, quickly establishing itself as one of the country’s leading automakers, second only to Fiat in production volumes.

Early models, such as the 16 HP and 24 HP, achieved immediate success in motorsport. That helped the brand earn a reputation for robustness, reliability, and performance.

A key turning point came in 1904, when major investment from Genoa led to the creation of Itala Fabbrica Automobili and the construction of a modern factory. Design was entrusted to leading engineers like Alberto Balloco, whose work produced cars that defined an era.

Among Balloco's creations, the Itala 100 HP became the undisputed star of the 1905 racing season. It won the Coppa Florio and outperformed rivals just down the road, including some of Fiat's best racers.

Success & Cutting-Edge Technology

In 1906, Itala won the first Targa Florio. In 1907, the brand cemented its legendary status with a Peking to Paris victory, won by Prince Scipione Borghese in an Itala 35/45 HP. More than a sporting achievement, the journey captured global attention, with Luigi Barzini’s reports in Corriere della Sera spreading the Itala name worldwide and increasing the brand’s prestige.

In the years leading up to World War I, Itala embodied Italian industrial excellence, offering a wide range of models, an international sales network, and groundbreaking innovations such as the ""avalve"" engine—a quiet, refined design without mechanical valves. These engines delivered performance up to 25 percent better than contemporaries, though at a high production cost.

It was Itala's pursuit of technical perfection, combined with lackluster financial management, that ultimately led to instability within the company.

War and Decline

Photo by: RM Sotheby's

World War I marked a dramatic turning point for Itala. The company shifted to licensed production of Hispano-Suiza aircraft engines, requiring massive investment. Government orders, however, fell sharply after the war, leaving Itala in financial difficulty. Despite producing elegant models such as the 50, 51, and the luxurious six-cylinder 55, Itala struggled to reconnect with a market transformed by the post-war era.

In the 1920s, Itala attempted to relaunch through state intervention and the arrival of Giulio Cesare Cappa, who designed the sophisticated Itala 61. Technically advanced, the model proved too expensive to produce. At the same time, visionary projects such as the 11 and 15 single-seaters—true engineering marvels—never progressed beyond the prototype stage.

Financial troubles deepened, leading to a 1929 merger with the Società Anonima Officine Metallurgiche e Meccaniche di Tortona and subsequent restructuring attempts. The final efforts by the ""new"" Itala SACA in the early 1930s failed to reverse the decline.

In 1934, the curtain finally fell on what many considered ""the other Fiat,"" a brand that anticipated the future but was ultimately undone by its own structural limits.

A Legacy Reborn

The 2026 comeback under the DR Automobiles Group brings the Itala story back into the spotlight—a story defined by innovation, daring feats, and boundless ambition. Even today, it remains one of the noblest chapters in Italy’s automotive history.

We can't wait to see what's next for the Itala brand.

At a time when just 29% of leaders say their organization’s operational risk and process safety management is optimized, here are five ways to embed safety into your 2026 strategic planning: Connect worker safety to business goals.","In high-risk industries like oil and gas, chemicals, and process manufacturing, safety is not just a compliance requirement — it’s a strategic lever for resilience and performance. Yet too often, safety infrastructure lags behind, sidelined by operational demands or budget constraints.

Nearly half of safety leaders (49%) cite the lack and loss of experienced personnel as the top factor increasing risk, while 39% point to limited visibility into operational risks within aging facilities.

Combined with a younger, less experienced workforce and volatile regulatory demands, these risk factors are stretching organizations thin and straining safety programs, just as risks are multiplying.

Despite this, many organizations still rely on outdated systems to manage safety, postponing modernization until it’s too late. When business is booming, safety upgrades fall down the list of priorities. When business slows, budgets tighten and transformation stalls. Inaction in either scenario only amplifies risk to workers.

As you set priorities and budget for the year ahead, make safety a central focus. Do not treat safety as a cost center or a checkbox. Value it as the performance driver it is. Using technology to modernize worker safety standards now is an investment in people, productivity, and preparedness.

Why worker safety still lags in high-risk industries

Caution is natural in high-hazard environments, but it often calcifies into resistance to change.

This mindset is reflected in the tools many organizations use today. Spreadsheets and paper forms remain the norm for managing critical safety processes, even though these methods obscure information and increase the likelihood of missteps.

Across industries, legacy tools that lack real-time visibility and accountability leave workers vulnerable and compromise operational continuity. Take, for example, a maintenance permit buried in a spreadsheet. It may go unnoticed until crews begin hazardous work without proper authorization or equipment, leading to a reactive safety culture where risks are addressed after issues arise.

Even well-designed safety programs can falter in execution. Two-thirds of safety leaders report a disconnect between their safety goals and what actually happens in the field. Leaders may assume compliance, but without real-time insight, accountability erodes and risk exposure rises.

America’s aging infrastructure compounds the challenge. Refineries and chemical plants built decades ago are harder to retrofit and more prone to failure. Ensuring mechanical integrity demands constant attention, yet many teams lack the bandwidth or tools to keep up.

Modernization is widely acknowledged as overdue. But without executive alignment or clear urgency, safety initiatives stall. Over time, these delays stack up, and when a serious incident occurs it’s often too late to avoid a life-or-death scenario.

Making worker safety a business imperative

Improving safety outcomes requires integration across people, processes, and technology. When treated as a business priority, safety enhances operational resilience while also supporting employee experience and protecting performance.

At a time when just 29% of leaders say their organization’s operational risk and process safety management is optimized, here are five ways to embed safety into your 2026 strategic planning:

Connect worker safety to business goals.

Your ability to grow the business depends on worker safety. Safety incidents can halt production, damage morale, and erode customer confidence.

By linking safety initiatives to core business outcomes like uptime, continuity, and productivity, you reframe it as a source of value creation, not just a compliance responsibility.

This reframing also influences investment decisions. When safety is part of conversations about growth and efficiency, it receives the attention it deserves. Treating safety as a business enabler better aligns it with other enterprise goals and makes resilience a shared responsibility, from executives to front-line teams.

2. Standardize and digitize your processes and systems.

Spreadsheets and emails lack the structure and accountability required to uphold safety standards in high-risk environments.

Modernization intervenes by standardizing key workflows under a single source of truth: permit-to-work, management of change, risk assessments, contractor safety, and more. Errors reduce when responsibilities are clear and steps are consistent.

Digitization takes this evolution further. With centralized platforms, permits and inspections move through defined workflows with clear visibility into what’s submitted, pending, or approved, and by whom. This level of easy-to-access detail reduces delays and errors and eliminates redundancy.

3. Make your data work for you.

Integrating systems is only the first step. The real value lies in how data is used to prevent incidents and optimize performance.

Each inspection, permit, or near miss logged into a digital system adds to a rich dataset that reveals emerging and broader operational risks. Empower operators and supervisors with access to relevant data for their shifts and locations, including barriers, isolations, and overdue actions — so teams can anticipate and address issues before they escalate.

Leaders, meanwhile, should monitor forward-looking indicators such as maintenance backlogs and repeated barrier failures.

AI can assist by flagging trends, standardizing reports, and suggesting actions. In high-hazard industries, though, AI must be applied fit-for-purpose with people firmly in the loop. Every alert should feed directly into workflows with clear ownership and timelines, so data quickly translates into action.

4. Champion people alongside technology change.

Technology alone won’t improve safety. A big barrier is often people, especially middle managers who already carry heavy workloads and may hesitate to disrupt established routines.

This makes proactive change management critical. Lead with empathy, clear executive sponsorship, and consistent communication. Highlight how new systems improve workflows, reduce administrative burdens, and enhance worker safety.

Likewise, many younger employees expect digital tools in the workplace, regardless of industry. Modernization supports both recruitment and retention by signaling that both safety and innovation are core values.

5. Build for long-term resilience.

Connected systems create a detailed record of safety performance. From overdue actions to trends in barrier impairments to near-miss reports, aggregated data reveals weak points before they become failures.

For example, trend analysis on overdue actions can prompt early interventions before compliance gaps widen. Spotting clusters of near misses can guide targeted training to prevent future incidents, whether that’s by employee segments or facility locations. An increase in overdue safety tasks might signal other resource constraints that need to be addressed as well.

The value extends beyond immediate fixes. Data-driven safety keeps your business agile so you can more effectively handle what’s next, whether it’s new regulations, workforce turnover, or industry shifts like the transition to clean energy.

Planning for safety is planning for resilience

There will never be a perfect moment to modernize safety. But delaying action — whether due to growth pressures or budget constraints — only raises the stakes. Real people are put at risk.

As you plan and allocate budget for the year ahead, make safety an integral part of your business strategy. Strong, connected safety systems are the backbone of resilience and growth.

Add all of those factors together, and it is no wonder that UA can’t come close to dethroning DL.","Ben is clearly trying to drive his own reader metrics to close out the year. that is perfectly obvious.

Jon’s tweet which so many of you cling to you proves precisely why I have so much fun on this and other sites.

“Year to date cancellation rates, mainline and regional combined, with mainline weighted more heavily than regional.”

Completely predictable. The arrogant UA fan crowd that can’t stand to admit that they really are #2 have to cherrypick and manipulate data in order to show themselves on top. Only in their mind do they weight flights to skew the data which doesn't math otherwise.

UA cancelled far more flights during its spring EWR meltdown including more regional flights (so its narrowbody flights to Europe could operate) but we’re supposed to not only forget that – despite the fact that it made national news for weeks on end – so we can blow a bad DL weekend way out of proportion.

And even if UA ends 2025 with a lower COMBINED rate of cancellations than DL, UA will still trail DL in on-time and, most notably, baggage handling where it sits at the bottom of the industry with AA.

It’s pretty obvious what these discussions are really about: a small group of people w/ low self-esteems (including a number of UA execs) that cannot honestly accept where their company really is and let other people recognize what they have legitimately done to improve that company which was horribly mismanaged UA for so long.

And the bigger issue is that DL, UA and every other US airline are for-profit businesses and UA simply does a far worse job of running its business than DL even though we have heard for the better part of a decade that UA would close the gap w/ DL. In fact, UA’s net profit for the first 3 quarters of 2025 trails DL’s by almost $1.5 billion dollars; DL made 64% more net profits than UA in the first 3 quarters and UA won’t close the gap in the 4th quarter.

I get that everyone wants to be the one that throws the guy sitting at the top off of their reign – but UA is nowhere near close to doing that either financially or operationally – and it takes cherrypicking and data manipulation for them to even try to argue their success.

Let’s also not forget that UA has yet to settle post covid labor contracts with two major unions representing over 1/3 of its entire workforce – which is at the root of what this whole discussion about DL’s pilot workrules and the automation to support it.

DL led the airline industry post covid in settling w/ its pilots in a contract worth twice as much as what UA offered and its pilots handedly rejected. DL then spread pay raises to its non-pilot, non-union personnel which has forced labor costs for the industry – except for UA – to astronomical levels. IOW, DL manages to report the highest profits in the US and still lead the industry in paying its employees. No other airline in the world generates profits on par with DL when adjusted for DL’s labor costs.

And UA loves to get in fights with everyone it can find – WN at DEN, AA at ORD, and any ULCC whatsoever – and UA is throwing more absolute capacity into the industry than any other US airline. UA has managed to turn its TPAC operation profitable but is now consistently losing money flying to Latin America where it is being marginalized and cut off from high value traffic by AA and DL. Add all of those factors together, and it is no wonder that UA can’t come close to dethroning DL.

Peter McGoldrick has given his Hold rating due to a combination of factors related to Nike’s ongoing turnaround and its current valuation. He sees encouraging operational progress, including healthier inventory levels in North America that support the thesis of a domestically led recovery, and early signs that the apparel category is regaining volume momentum. He also notes that the company’s renewed emphasis on wholesale distribution, with the highest North America wholesale mix since the pandemic, appears more aligned with Nike’s future channel strategy, even though it entails lower average selling prices. However, footwear unit trends remain lackluster, and the overall volume trajectory is not yet strong enough to confidently underpin the mid-single-digit revenue growth needed to drive the financial model.

At the same time, McGoldrick believes the equity market is already assigning Nike a premium valuation multiple that assumes successful execution of the turnaround over the next several years. With the shares trading at roughly 25 times his FY27 earnings estimate, he views the upside potential as limited relative to the risks associated with restoring market share and normalizing the business, which he expects may not fully materialize until around 2027. While he characterizes the eventual turnaround as likely, he does not yet see a sufficiently asymmetric risk/reward profile to justify a more constructive recommendation. As a result, he maintains a neutral stance and continues to rate the stock as Hold.

In the ever-evolving realm of digital creativity, Adobe Photoshop has long stood as the cornerstone for professionals in graphic design, photography, and visual arts. As we close out 2025, the software’s integration of artificial intelligence has reached new heights, offering tools that not only streamline workflows but also push the boundaries of what’s possible in image manipulation. Drawing from recent updates, these AI enhancements are transforming how insiders approach projects, from rapid prototyping to intricate compositing. This deep dive explores the most impactful features, their practical applications, and the implications for industry practitioners.

At the heart of Photoshop’s latest advancements is the Generative Fill tool, which has evolved significantly since its introduction. Powered by Adobe’s Firefly AI model, it allows users to add, remove, or expand elements within images using simple text prompts. For instance, professionals can now seamlessly extend backgrounds or insert objects that blend naturally with existing compositions. According to a detailed guide from Elegant Themes, this feature has become indispensable for photographers needing to adjust compositions without reshooting.

Beyond Generative Fill, the introduction of Harmonize and Generative Upscale in the desktop version marks a pivotal shift. Harmonize intelligently matches colors and lighting across different image elements, ensuring cohesive results in composite work. Generative Upscale, on the other hand, enhances image resolution while preserving details, which is crucial for print professionals dealing with low-res assets. These tools, as highlighted in Adobe’s official release notes on their help site, are designed to save hours in post-production.

Elevating Precision with Conversational Editing

The integration of conversational editing represents another leap forward, allowing users to describe changes in natural language for AI to execute. This feature, rolled out in late 2025, enables phrases like “make the sky more dramatic” to trigger adjustments in exposure, contrast, and color grading. Industry insiders note that this reduces the learning curve for complex edits, making Photoshop more accessible to multidisciplinary teams. A recent analysis from ZDNET emphasizes how this tool democratizes high-level editing for non-experts.

Complementing these is the enhanced Neural Filters suite, which now includes advanced options like Style Transfer and Portrait Enhancer. Style Transfer applies artistic styles from reference images, ideal for concept artists iterating on visual themes. The Portrait Enhancer uses AI to refine facial features, smoothing skin and adjusting lighting with minimal manual input. As per a step-by-step tutorial in Creative Studios Derby, these filters are particularly valuable in fashion and advertising, where quick turnarounds are essential.

Moreover, Photoshop’s collaboration with third-party AI models expands creative possibilities. Users can now switch to models like Flux or Nano Banana for Generative Fill, each excelling in specific scenarios—Flux for realistic textures and Nano Banana for stylized outputs. This flexibility, detailed in an article from Digital Camera World, allows professionals to tailor AI assistance to project needs, from photorealistic renders to abstract designs.

Integration with Broader Ecosystems and Workflows

A groundbreaking development is Photoshop’s embedding within ChatGPT, announced in December 2025. This integration lets users edit images conversationally without leaving the chat interface, handling tasks like background removal or PDF modifications. No subscription is required for basic features, broadening access. CNET reports that this addresses common frustrations in AI editing, such as iterative refinements, by enabling real-time feedback loops.

This ChatGPT tie-in extends to Adobe Express and Acrobat, facilitating seamless workflows across apps. For example, a designer can generate an image in Photoshop via ChatGPT, then incorporate it into a PDF presentation. TechCrunch covered this rollout in depth, noting in their piece on TechCrunch how it empowers users to animate elements or modify documents through prompts, streamlining content creation for marketers and educators.

On the performance side, updates in Photoshop 2025 include AI-driven optimization for hardware acceleration, ensuring smoother operation on diverse devices. This is especially beneficial for remote teams using cloud-based workflows. The Photoshop Training Channel outlines how these enhancements reduce lag in large-scale projects, a boon for film and game industry professionals handling high-resolution assets.

Practical Tutorials and Real-World Applications

To harness these tools effectively, insiders recommend starting with tutorials that break down each feature. For Generative Fill, select an area, input a prompt, and let AI generate variations—refine with masks for precision. A comprehensive walkthrough from Aela.io demonstrates how this accelerates ideation in product design, where rapid mockups are key.

For conversational editing, integrate it into daily routines by combining it with layer management. Professionals in e-commerce photography use it to batch-process product images, adjusting lighting uniformly across sets. Lifehacker’s hands-on test, as shared in their article on Lifehacker, reveals that while initial results impress, iterative prompting yields professional-grade outcomes.

Industry sentiment, gleaned from posts on X, reflects excitement mixed with cautious optimism. Users praise the time savings but debate AI’s role in creativity, with some viewing it as a replacement for traditional skills. One viral thread highlighted how these tools could “flip the design industry,” echoing broader discussions on AI’s disruptive potential without confirming wholesale job displacement.

Ethical Considerations and Future Trajectories

As AI permeates Photoshop, ethical questions arise, particularly around authenticity and bias in generated content. Insiders must navigate copyright implications when using AI-trained on vast datasets. Adobe addresses this by emphasizing ethical AI development in Firefly, trained on licensed images. Google’s AI updates blog, in a post on Google’s blog, parallels this by discussing breakthroughs in responsible AI, offering a comparative view for Photoshop users.

Looking ahead, integrations like third-party models suggest a trend toward modular AI ecosystems. This could lead to specialized plugins for niches like medical imaging or architectural visualization. The Reddit community, in discussions on Reddit, debates opting for pre-AI versions, underscoring a divide between purists and adopters.

For insiders, mastering these tools involves balancing AI assistance with human ingenuity. Workshops and certifications are emerging to train on ethical usage, ensuring AI enhances rather than supplants creativity. As one X post noted, these features save “hundreds of hours,” allowing focus on conceptual work.

Case Studies from Industry Leaders

Real-world applications illuminate AI’s impact. In advertising, agencies use Generative Upscale to repurpose archival photos for high-definition campaigns, maintaining quality without original files. A case from the fashion sector, as per industry reports, shows Portrait Enhancer cutting retouching time by 70%, enabling faster seasonal lookbooks.

Film post-production benefits from Harmonize, syncing visual effects across frames seamlessly. VFX artists report improved efficiency in compositing CGI with live footage. Drawing from Google’s research breakthroughs detailed on their blog, similar AI advancements in image editing hint at cross-pollination between tech giants, potentially influencing future Photoshop updates.

Educators and trainers are incorporating these tools into curricula, teaching students to leverage AI for innovation. Online platforms offer courses that simulate professional scenarios, preparing the next generation for an AI-augmented field.

Navigating Challenges and Best Practices

Despite advantages, challenges persist, such as AI hallucinations where generated elements don’t align perfectly. Best practices include verifying outputs with manual tweaks and using reference images for guidance. Insiders recommend versioning files to track AI interventions, maintaining transparency in collaborative projects.

Hardware considerations are key; while cloud processing handles heavy lifts, local setups benefit from GPUs for real-time edits. Adobe’s updates optimize for this, but users should monitor system requirements.

Community feedback on X underscores the need for ongoing tutorials, with users sharing tips on optimizing prompts for better results. This collective knowledge base enriches the ecosystem, fostering innovation.

Strategic Implications for Professionals

For industry leaders, adopting these AI features strategically positions firms ahead of competitors. Integrating them into pipelines can reduce costs and accelerate deliverables, crucial in fast-paced sectors like social media content creation.

Looking to 2026, rumors suggest deeper AI personalization, perhaps predictive editing based on user history. This could revolutionize bespoke design services.

Ultimately, Photoshop’s AI evolution empowers creators to focus on vision over mechanics, heralding a new era of digital artistry where technology amplifies human potential. As tools mature, the line between creator and creation blurs, inviting endless possibilities.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/article-5199-1767142358.jpeg,N,,2025-12-31 08:12:50.957913

“From Warren Buffett, I’ve learned that excellence really is a discipline,” said Larry Restieri, CEO at wealth management firm Hightower.
“When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world,” Buffett wrote in 2025.","(CNN) — Warren Buffett has worn many hats over the years: The stock-picking Oracle of Omaha. An avuncular, Dairy-Queen-eating, Coke-drinking product pitchman. A living symbol of capitalism and its complexities.

But for generations of business leaders, the 95-year-old has also served as something else: a teacher.

Buffett’s combination of success and sagacity has made him one of the most famous investors in the world, “on the Mount Rushmore of business leaders in our country,” Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said. And through his advice-packed investor letters, his hourslong quote-fest annual meetings, his choices at work or in his personal life, Buffett has taught CEOs and executives around the world how to run their businesses and, in many cases, their lives.

Buffett, who’s spent much of his life among the top 10 richest people in the world, is stepping down Wednesday as head of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway; protégé Greg Abel will take the reins Thursday.

As the iconic investor steps down from his post, several business leaders told CNN about the lessons Buffett leaves behind.

‘Predicting rain doesn’t count’

As a journalist, I’ve covered countless earnings reports. None were as fun as Berkshire Hathaway’s, in large part because Buffett remains among the business world’s top communicators.

He said what he meant, and he never used a 10-cent word if a one-cent word would do. And he was flat-out funny in a way that made covering him a hoot.

“What I’ve always admired about Warren Buffett, and (his late business partner) Charlie Munger for that matter, is their use of plain English and plain language to explain difficult concepts,” Steve Hafner, the CEO of Kayak, said. “It takes a lot of skill to take a complex issue and just split it to the bare minimum.”

Their dry wit made “their shareholder letter one of my favorite reads,” he added.

Some gems among those shareholder letters:

“It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who’s been swimming naked.”“Predicting rain doesn’t count; building arks does.”“I’ve reluctantly discarded the notion of my continuing to manage the portfolio after my death – abandoning my hope to give new meaning to the term ‘thinking outside the box.’”

‘Our favorite holding period is forever’

One theme among the CEOs who spoke to CNN: Buffett’s legendary patience. Buffett was known to sit on ginormous piles of cash at Berkshire, waiting for the right opportunity to invest. And when he did invest, he was in it for the long haul: “our favorite holding period is forever,” he wrote to shareholders in 1989.

Investor, podcaster, entrepreneur and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci wrote to Buffett 30 years ago, saying he was buying Berkshire shares for his daughter.

“And since she was one and a half years old with a life expectancy of 84 years, she had 82 and a half years left in which to hold her stock,” Scaramucci said.

“He wrote back very quickly and said that was a manifestation of short-termism. His own intention was to hold the stock for a hundred years.”

‘I will be ruthless’

Yes, Buffett was a shark who made billions of dollars off Goldman Sachs, among the most hardcore capitalists on the planet.

But he was a shark with ethics.

“From Warren Buffett, I’ve learned that excellence really is a discipline,” said Larry Restieri, CEO at wealth management firm Hightower. “Set a clear direction, stay true to your principles and execute patiently.”

Buffett racked up a net worth around $150 billion, according to Bloomberg, but he always emphasized honesty and integrity.

And he expected the same from every single person who worked with him: “Lose money for the firm and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless,” he once testified before Congress.

‘A vast collection of possessions ends up possessing its owner’

Buffett famously loves flying private. He is a Cadillac fan. He is uber-wealthy, and he makes no apologies for it.

But he has also decided to pass on some of his massive riches. Buffett, along with Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates, created the Giving Pledge in 2010 for the world’s richest people to promise “to give the majority of their wealth to charitable causes in their lifetime or wills.”

Marcel Arsenault, the CEO of Real Capital Solutions, is one of the people who signed that pledge. “Warren inspired me to think beyond monetary success,” he told CNN.

In a letter explaining his commitment, Buffett wrote: “Too often, a vast collection of possessions ends up possessing its owner.”

But giving doesn’t have to be about piles of cash.

Sampoerna Tbk right now – and that might be the whole opportunity. You have a low-key Indonesian tobacco giant plugged into one of the biggest cigarette companies on the planet, quietly throwing off cash while everyone else chases the next AI meme stock.

So, is PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk actually worth your money, or is this just another slow, dusty value play your friend who “loves dividends” keeps talking about?

Let's talk hype, real numbers, and whether this is a cop or drop.

The Hype is Real: PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk on TikTok and Beyond

Here's the real talk: PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk is not trending on your For You Page like Nvidia, Tesla, or whatever meme coin just rug-pulled your feed. But tobacco stocks live in a weird lane: low clout, high cash.

You're not seeing people flex Sampoerna shares on TikTok, but you are seeing creators talk about dividend plays, “boring but rich” stocks, and global income portfolios. That's exactly where a company like this sneaks in.

Want to see the receipts? Check the latest reviews here:

Watch viral TikTok reviews of PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk

Watch honest tests on YouTube

Right now the “clout” level is low-key. That doesn't mean it's a flop. It just means this is more “quiet money” than “viral flex.”

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Let's break down PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk from a US retail investor point of view: worth the hype or nah?

1. The Stock Price Reality Check

Using live market data from multiple financial sources, PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk (ticker usually listed as HMSP on the Indonesia Stock Exchange) most recently traded on the Indonesia market at a price reflecting a modest daily move, with the latest available figure based on the last market close. As of the latest verified data pull on the current date, after cross-checking two separate finance feeds, the stock is basically moving in a tight range with no wild meme-style spikes.

Important: The Indonesia Stock Exchange is outside US hours, so you're mostly looking at last close data when you check it during the US trading day. No guessing, no hype math.

What matters more: this is a dividend-heavy, slow-mover type of play, not a “double in a week” lottery ticket.

2. The Business Model: Cash Machine, Not Trend Machine

PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk is a major cigarette producer in Indonesia, tied to Philip Morris International. Translation: they sell a product a lot of regulators hate but millions still buy daily.

Key angles for you:

Cash flow: Tobacco companies are known for strong, consistent cash, even when growth is flat.

Dividends: Historically, this type of stock is all about paying out to shareholders. You don't buy it to brag; you buy it to collect.

Risk: Regulatory pressure and smoking decline trends are always in the background, which is why many investors put these stocks in the “high-yield but controversial” bucket.

If you're here for fast growth, it might feel like a flop. If you're here for slow, steady income, this lane can be a quiet win.

3. The “Is It Worth the Hype?” Test

On social, people scream about AI, EVs, and crypto. PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk fails the viral test on purpose. Its vibe is more:

Low volatility vs. meme spikes

Dividends vs. crazy capital gains

Emerging market exposure vs. pure US tech plays

So is it a game-changer? Not in the “new technology” sense. But in a diversified portfolio, for someone who wants global cash-flow assets, it can absolutely be a quiet must-have.

PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk vs. The Competition

You can't judge this stock in a vacuum. The real rivalry is Sampoerna vs other giants in the tobacco and nicotine world.

Global Rivals: Philip Morris International, British American Tobacco, Altria

Big global names like Philip Morris International (PM), British American Tobacco (BTI), and Altria (MO) dominate US investor attention. They trade in New York, they show up on US broker apps instantly, and they get way more social chatter.

How Sampoerna stacks up:

Clout: Global giants win. Their tickers are everywhere, they get analyst coverage, and they get dragged into every “sin stock” debate thread.

Access: US stocks are easier for American retail investors to tap into than a single-name Indonesian listing.

Local edge: PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk is laser-focused on Indonesia, one of the world's biggest cigarette markets. Local dominance vs global spread.

Who Wins the Clout War?

If we're talking pure viral potential, the winner is the global names. More people search them, more TikToks mention them, and more YouTube creators review their dividends and “sin stock” strategies.

But if the question is: where can a patient investor potentially find under-the-radar value? Sampoerna has a shot. While everyone fights over the same US tickers, this one sits in the “know if you know” zone.

So in a clout contest, Sampoerna loses. In a “quiet, cash-focused, emerging market tobacco” niche? It absolutely holds its own.

The Business Side: Sampoerna

Here's where it gets serious. PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk is tied to the ISIN ID1000070105, listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. That ISIN is your unique ID tag for this exact stock. No confusion, no ticker mix-ups.

From a fundamentals angle, you're looking at:

Sector: Tobacco and cigarettes, a classic “sin stock” space.

Market: Indonesia, one of the largest cigarette markets in the world.

Structure: Connected to a global player (Philip Morris International) but operating as a local champion.

On the price-performance side, recent trading action has been more about small percentage moves around the last close than huge breakouts. That fits the profile: this is a defensive, income-tilted stock, not a moonshot.

Also, remember: if you're in the US, you're dealing with:

FX risk: Indonesian rupiah vs US dollar.

Access issues: You may need a broker that supports foreign markets or depository receipts, depending on how you want exposure.

Regulation and ethics: Tobacco is always under fire. Some funds avoid it completely; others lean in for yield.

The move here is not “ape in.” It's research, compare, size carefully.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let's keep it blunt.

If you want a viral stock you can brag about on TikTok, this is a drop. There's no flashy tech, no meme army, no overnight x10 fantasy.

If you want:

Exposure to a major emerging market

A classic dividend and cash flow style play

A “boring but potentially steady” name tied to a global tobacco giant

Then PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk can absolutely be a cop — if you:

Understand the ethical and regulatory baggage around tobacco

Accept currency and emerging market risk

Are cool with “slow and steady” instead of trying to go viral with your portfolio

Is it a game-changer? Not in the culture sense. Is it potentially a smart, under-hyped income piece in a global portfolio? That's where it quietly wins.

Real talk: this is not for everyone. But if you're building a serious, mixed-asset portfolio and not just chasing the next meme, PT H.M. Sampoerna Tbk deserves at least a spot on your watchlist.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404990_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 10:01:30.124222

You know HP Inc. as the printer and laptop brand that’s been in your life since school. But right now, its stock is doing the ""wait, how is this up again?"" move that has Wall Street and TikTok quietly paying attention.

While everyone is chasing the loud AI names, HP Inc. (ticker: HPQ) is running a different play: steady profits, massive buybacks, chunky dividends, and a sneaky AI PC angle that could flip the script on what ""boring"" looks like in your portfolio.

So let’s talk real talk: is HP Inc. a must-have money play right now, or a value trap dressed up as a comeback story?

The Hype is Real: HP Inc. on TikTok and Beyond

HP isn’t the flashiest brand on your For You Page, but it’s absolutely in the mix. From budget creators shopping for study laptops to small businesses rage-posting about printer ink prices, HP content is everywhere – and it’s surprisingly positive.

Creators are calling out HP for one thing: solid performance for the price. Not the sexiest flex, but when you’re buying gear to actually get stuff done, that hits.

Want to see the receipts? Check the latest reviews here:

Watch viral TikTok reviews of HP Inc.

Watch honest tests on YouTube

From unboxings of budget HP laptops to side-by-side tests against way pricier machines, the vibe is the same: ""Did I just pay way less and still get a legit setup?""

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Let’s strip this down. When you look at HP Inc. right now, three things really matter: price, AI, and cash flow.

1. The Stock Price Move: Sneaky Strong

On the market side, HP Inc. trades under the ticker HPQ in the US. Based on live data pulled from major financial platforms, HPQ is sitting around the mid-$30s per share, with the latest quoted price and performance coming from real-time sources like Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch. As of the most recent market session, the numbers show the stock holding comfortably in that range, with the last close slightly below the live quote when markets were active. Exact intraday ticks change constantly, but here’s the real talk: HP has been drifting higher over recent months instead of collapsing like a dying hardware dinosaur.

That matters. In a market where hype names spike and crash, HP is acting like a slow-burn compounder: not viral, but not dead money either.

2. AI PCs: The ""Wait, HP Does That Too?"" Angle

HP isn’t trying to be the next pure AI software god. Instead, it’s doing something more practical: AI-powered PCs and creator-focused laptops. Think machines optimized for on-device AI tasks, better battery, smoother video calls, faster content workflows.

Is it a game-changer? For you as a buyer, it can be. HP’s AI-focused laptops and workstations are positioned as ""do more with less"" tools: fewer lags, more multitasking, video, editing, streaming, and school or work in the same box without meltdown.

If HP sticks the landing here, it turns into the quiet backbone of the AI hardware world – not the brand trending every day, but the gear behind a ton of content, work, and small-business setups.

3. Cash Machine Mode: Dividends and Buybacks

This is the part that doesn’t go viral on TikTok but absolutely matters for your portfolio. HP Inc. throws off serious cash flow and sends a lot of it back to shareholders. We’re talking a steady dividend yield that’s actually noticeable, plus aggressive stock buybacks that shrink the share count over time.

Translation: HP is literally using its own cash to boost the value of each share you own. If you’re into long-term stacking instead of day-trading chaos, this is not a flop move. It’s the ""quietly getting rich"" strategy.

HP Inc. vs. The Competition

In your actual shopping cart and in the stock market, HP’s biggest rival is Dell, with Lenovo and Apple lurking in the mix.

HP vs Dell: Who Wins the Clout War?

For clout: Apple wins, obviously. MacBooks will always get more aesthetic desk shots and influencer love.

For ""bang for your buck"" PCs: That’s where HP and Dell go head-to-head.

HP: Strong in consumer laptops, Chromebooks, student devices, and SMB printers. Feels more ""everyday user"" and content-creator friendly at midrange prices.

Dell: Big in corporate fleets and work setups. XPS line has serious respect with power users, but prices can climb fast.

On the stock side, both HP and Dell lean into buybacks and dividends. The difference is perception: Dell gets more ""serious enterprise"" respect, while HP feels like the accessible brand you’ve actually owned.

So who wins? If you want pure clout, you go Apple. If you want a realistic, affordable setup that gets the job done without nuking your budget, HP is absolutely in the ""worth the hype"" lane right now – especially for students, creators, and side-hustlers.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let’s answer it straight: Is HP Inc. a cop or a drop?

As a product brand: HP is a solid cop if you care more about value and performance than flexing. The laptops and printers may not trend every week, but real users keep buying them because they work and they’re priced to move. For a lot of people, that’s a game-changer.

As a stock (HPQ): HP is a quiet cop for long-term thinkers, not short-term moon-chasers. You’re not getting the explosive AI meme-stock story, but you are getting:

A stock that hasn’t totally blown up in price yet.

Cash coming back to you through dividends and buybacks.

Exposure to the AI PC wave without paying AI-bubble prices.

If your vibe is ""set it, watch it, and let compounding do its thing,"" HP looks more like a no-brainer value play than a flop. If you only want hyper-viral, triple-digit growth stories, you’ll probably find HP too chill for your taste.

Real talk: HP Inc. sits in that underrated zone where the social media chatter is modest, the numbers are grown-up, and the upside comes from patience, not panic-buying.

The Business Side: HP Inc. Aktie

For anyone watching the company as a global stock play, HP Inc. is also traded as an ""Aktie"" on international markets, tied to the ISIN US40434L1052. That code is basically the universal ID for HP Inc. shares across borders.

Here’s what matters from a market-watch angle:

Stability over drama: HP’s financials lean into predictable hardware demand, recurring printer supplies, and services. Less meme, more math.

AI as an upgrade cycle: As AI PCs and next-gen laptops roll out, HP gets a shot at a major refresh cycle. Every time people replace old devices with AI-optimized ones, HP has a chance to grab more share.

Shareholder returns: Dividends and buybacks mean that even if growth is mid, total return can still be strong.

The catch? This is not a zero-to-hero story. HP’s upside is tied to execution: staying relevant in laptops, keeping printers profitable, and not getting steamrolled by Apple, Dell, or the next wave of AI hardware challengers.

If you want exposure to the everyday tech that actually powers offices, schools, and home setups – not just the buzziest headlines – HP Inc. Aktie (ISIN US40434L1052) is absolutely worth a look.

Bottom line: HP Inc. might never dominate your feed, but it might quietly boost your net worth. And in a market full of hype, that low-key might be the real game-changer.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405055_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 07:13:22.211437

With economic growth projected between 2.0-2.5%, a steepening yield curve, accelerating loan growth, and easing regulatory burdens, bank stocks appear poised for outperformance.

RBC Capital Markets highlights several key drivers for the sector’s robust outlook, including increased Commercial & Industrial lending, Commercial Real Estate financing, and home equity lending. Elevated M&A activity is also expected to benefit the industry.

However, the analysis warns that re-emerging inflation could prompt the Federal Reserve to shift monetary policy, potentially leading to higher interest rates that could impact the sector.

Bank of America is highlighted by RBC as well positioned to capitalize on the favorable banking environment projected for 2026.

Bank of America, along with Goldman Sachs, is leading a group of investors in the Texas Stock Exchange. The bank was also part of a group that shelved a planned $20 billion bailout for Argentina in favor of a smaller, short-term loan package.

Popular

Popular Inc. recently reported third-quarter 2025 earnings that surpassed EPS expectations, though revenue slightly missed forecasts. The company also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per share on its common stock.

Citigroup is included in RBC’s list of banks expected to benefit from accelerating loan growth and a steepening yield curve.

Citigroup received an upgrade from JPMorgan to Overweight from Neutral, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency terminated an amendment to a 2020 consent order. In addition, Citibank announced it would reduce its base lending rate to 6.75%.

First Horizon Corporation is cited by RBC as a bank positioned to perform well in a robust 2026 environment.

First Horizon Corporation’s board authorized a new $1.2 billion common stock repurchase program and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share.

The company also received an initiation of coverage with a Buy rating from Deutsche Bank, while Baird downgraded the stock to Neutral.

Fifth Third Bancorp is viewed positively by RBC as regulatory burdens ease and commercial lending accelerates.

Fifth Third Bancorp recently reported third-quarter 2025 results that beat both earnings and revenue forecasts. The company also announced upcoming board changes and received a price target increase from TD Cowen.

Huntington Bancshares Incorporated is among the banks RBC expects to benefit from projected economic growth.

Huntington Bancshares received a price target increase from RBC Capital and announced it would lower its prime rate to 6.75 percent. The bank also appointed Marc Dizard as chief investment officer for its Wealth Management division.

KeyCorp is highlighted by RBC as an institution positioned to capitalize on favorable banking conditions.

KeyCorp announced a reduction in its prime lending rate to 6.75 percent and received a price target increase from DA Davidson. The company also disclosed it will redeem all of its outstanding 4.700% Fixed Rate Senior Bank Notes due January 2026.

M&T Bank Corporation is included among RBC’s favored banks, positioned for potential outperformance.

M&T Bank Corporation reported third-quarter 2025 earnings that surpassed analyst expectations for earnings per share. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share on its common stock and reduced its prime lending rate.

The PNC Financial Services Group is viewed by RBC as having strong potential in the positive banking environment forecast for 2026.

The PNC Financial Services Group has received all required regulatory approvals to complete its acquisition of FirstBank Holding Company. Separately, PNC Bank announced it would reduce its prime lending rate to 6.75%.

Truist Financial Corporation is also included in RBC’s group of top U.S. banks, expected to benefit from loan growth and M&A activity.

RBC also highlighted , , , , and as additional bank stocks it favors within its constructive outlook for the sector.

The analysis emphasizes that continued economic growth and the steepening yield curve should create favorable conditions for these institutions, though investors should remain watchful for inflation signals that could alter the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy trajectory.

Victory Pioneer Disciplined Growth Fund (the “Fund”)

Supplement to the Fund’s Prospectus dated December 31, 2025, as in effect and as may be amended from time to time.

On September 30, 2025, the Board of Trustees of the Fund, upon the recommendation of Victory Capital Management Inc., the Fund’s investment adviser (“Victory Capital”), approved a change in the Fund’s custodian, sub-administrator, sub-fund accountant, and transfer agent to be effective close of business on or about February 6, 2026 (the “Effective Date”).

As of the Effective Date, FIS Investor Services LLC (“FIS”) will serve as transfer agent of the Fund. In connection with this change and following the Effective Date, shareholders may be able to reduce or eliminate the sales charge applicable to Class A shares of the Fund through a letter of intent or right of accumulation that includes other funds not managed by Victory Capital, in addition to funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise. Moreover, shares of a Fund, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of the same class of another fund in the Victory Funds mutual fund complex, including funds that are not managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise.

Prior to the Effective Date, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. serves as the Fund’s transfer agent. Until the Effective Date, all references in the Prospectus to FIS Investor Services LLC as the Fund’s transfer agent are deleted and replaced with references to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc.

Prior to the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-225-6292. After the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-539-FUND (1-800-539-3863).

Until the Effective Date, the following modifies (and if inconsistent, replaces) the information appearing in the Letter of Intent and Right of Accumulation bullet points of the Prospectus section “Choosing a Share Class”:

Letter of Intent - If you anticipate purchasing $50,000 or more of Class A shares of the Fund, including any purchase of other funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise (each, a “Victory Pioneer Fund”) of any share class (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans), within a 13-month period, you may qualify for a sales charge breakpoint as though you were investing the total amount in one lump sum. In order to qualify for the reduced sales charge, you must submit a non- binding Letter of Intent (the “Letter”) within 90 days of the start of the purchases. Each investment you make after signing the Letter will be entitled to the sales charge applicable to the total investment indicated in the Letter. You must start with a minimum initial investment of at least 5.00% of the total amount you intend to purchase. A portion of the shares purchased under the Letter will be held in escrow until the total investment has been completed. In the event you do not complete your commitment set forth in the Letter in the time period specified, sufficient escrowed shares will be redeemed to pay any applicable front-end sales charges;

Right of Accumulation - Whereas a Letter of Intent allows you to qualify for a discount by combining your current purchase amount with purchases you intend to make in the near future, a Right of Accumulation allows you to reduce the initial sales charge on a Class A investment by combining the amount of your current purchase with the current market value of prior investments made by you, your spouse (including domestic partner), and your

children under age 21 in any class of shares of any Victory Pioneer Fund (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans). The value of eligible existing holdings will be calculated by using the greater of the current value or the original investment amount. To ensure that you receive a reduced price using the Fund’s Right of Accumulation, you or your Investment Professional must inform the Funds that the Right applies each time shares are purchased and provide sufficient information to permit confirmation of qualification;

In addition, the following policies regarding Buying, Exchanging and Selling Shares remain in force until the Effective Date.

Share Prices for Transactions

If you place an order to purchase, exchange or sell shares that is received in good order by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent by the close of regular trading on the NYSE (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time), the share price for your transaction will be based on the net asset value determined as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE on that day (plus or minus any applicable sales charges). If your order is received by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent after the close of regular trading on the NYSE, or your order is not in good order, the share price will be based on the net asset value next determined after your order is received in good order by the Fund or authorized agent. The authorized agent is responsible for transmitting your order to the Fund in a timely manner.

Good order means that:

■You have provided adequate instructions

■There are no outstanding claims against your account

■There are no transaction limitations on your account

■Your request includes a signature guarantee if you:

■Are selling over $100,000 or exchanging over $500,000 worth of shares

Buying

You can buy shares at net asset value per share plus any applicable sales charge. The Distributor may reject any order until it has confirmed the order in writing and received payment. Normally, your financial intermediary will send your purchase request to the Fund’s transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

Minimum Investment Amounts

If you would like to buy Class A or Class C shares, the minimum investment required to open an account is $2,500 ($1,000 for IRA accounts), with additional investments of at least $50.

Eligible Investors may be subject to a minimum investment amount as detailed in that section.

For Class C shares, individual purchases of $250,000 and above will be made automatically in Class A shares.

If your account falls below the minimum investment amount, we may ask you to reestablish the minimum investment. If you do not do so within 60 days, we may close your account and send you the value of your account.

The minimum investment required to open an account may be waived or lowered for employees and immediate family members of the employees, of the Adviser, the Administrator, and their affiliates. In addition, the minimum investment required may be waived when the Fund is purchased through an Advisory Program, within qualified retirement plans or in other similar circumstances. Although the Fund may sometimes waive the minimum investment, when it does so, it always reserves the right to reject initial investments under the minimum at its discretion.

How to Buy Shares

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your purchase request to the Distributor and/or transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

By Phone or Online

You can use the telephone or online purchase privilege if you have an existing non- retirement account. Certain IRAs can use the telephone purchase privilege. If your account is eligible, you can purchase additional Fund shares by phone or online if:

When you request a telephone or online purchase, the Fund’s transfer agent will electronically debit the amount of the purchase from your bank account of record. The Fund’s transfer agent will purchase Fund shares for the amount of the debit at the offering price determined after the Fund’s transfer agent receives your telephone or online purchase instruction and good funds. It usually takes three business days for the Fund’s transfer agent to receive notification from your bank that good funds are available in the amount of your investment.

In Writing, by Mail

How to Exchange Shares

You may, under certain circumstances, exchange your shares for shares of the same class of another Victory Pioneer Fund. At this time, shares of a Victory Pioneer Fund may only be exchanged for the same share class of another Victory Pioneer Fund.

Your exchange request must be for at least $1,000. The Fund allows you to exchange your shares at net asset value without charging you either an initial or contingent deferred sales charge at the time of the exchange. Shares you acquire as part of an exchange will continue to be subject to any contingent deferred sales charge that applies to the shares you originally purchased. When you ultimately sell your shares, the date of your original purchase will determine your contingent deferred sales charge.

Before you request an exchange, consider each fund’s investment objective(s) and policies as described in the Fund’s prospectus. You generally will have to pay income taxes on an exchange.

Same-Fund Exchange Privilege

Certain shareholders may be eligible to exchange their shares for shares of another class. If eligible, no sales charges or other charges will apply to any such exchange. Generally, shareholders will not recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes upon such an exchange. Investors should contact their financial intermediary to learn more about the details of this privilege.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your exchange request to the Fund’s transfer agent.

Consult your investment professional for more information about exchanging your shares.

By Phone or Online

After you establish an eligible fund account, you can exchange Fund shares by phone or online if:

■You are exchanging into an existing account or using the exchange to establish a new account, provided the new account has a registration identical to the original account

■The Fund into which you are exchanging offers the same class of shares

■You are not exchanging more than $500,000 worth of shares per account per day

■You can provide the proper account identification information

In Writing, by Mail, or by Fax

You can exchange Fund shares by mailing or faxing a letter of instruction to the Fund. You can exchange Fund shares directly through the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. However, you may not fax an exchange request for more than $500,000. Include in your letter:

■The name and signature of all registered owners

■A signature guarantee for each registered owner if the amount of the exchange is more than $500,000

■The name of the Fund out of which you are exchanging and the name of the Fund into which you are exchanging

■The class of shares you are exchanging

■The dollar amount or number of shares you are exchanging

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of exchange requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

How to Sell Shares

Your shares will be sold at the share price (net asset value less any applicable sales charge) next calculated after the Fund or its authorized agent, such as a broker-dealer, receives your request in good order. If a signature guarantee is required, you must submit your request in writing.

If the shares you are selling are subject to a deferred sales charge, it will be deducted from the sale proceeds. The Fund generally will send your sale proceeds by check, bank wire or electronic funds transfer. Your redemption proceeds normally will be sent within 1 business

day after your request is received in good order, but in any event within 7 days, regardless of the method the Fund uses to make such payment. If you recently sent a check to purchase the shares being sold, the Fund may delay payment of the sale proceeds until your check has cleared. This may take up to 10 calendar days from the purchase date.

Your redemption proceeds may be delayed, or your right to receive redemption proceeds suspended, if the NYSE is closed (other than on weekends or holidays) or trading is restricted, if the SEC determines an emergency or other circumstances exist that make it impracticable for the Fund to sell or value its portfolio securities, or otherwise as permitted by the rules of or by the order of the SEC.

If you are selling shares from a non-retirement account or certain IRAs, you may use any of the methods described below. If you are selling shares from a retirement account other than an IRA, you must make your request in writing.

You generally will have to pay income taxes on a sale.

If you must use a written request to exchange or sell your shares and your account is registered in the name of a corporation or other fiduciary you must include the name of an authorized person and a certified copy of a current corporate resolution, certificate of incumbency or similar legal document showing that the named individual is authorized to act on behalf of the record owner.

Under normal circumstances, the Fund expects to meet redemption requests by using cash or cash equivalents in its portfolio and/or selling portfolio assets to generate cash. Under stressed or abnormal market conditions or circumstances, including circumstances adversely affecting the liquidity of the Fund’s investments, the Fund may be more likely to be forced to sell portfolio assets to meet redemptions than under normal market circumstances. Under such circumstances, the Fund could be forced to liquidate assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value. The Fund also may pay redemption proceeds using cash obtained through a committed, unsecured revolving credit facility, or an interfund lending facility, if available, and other borrowing arrangements that may be available from time to time.

The Fund reserves the right to redeem in kind, that is, to pay all or a portion of your redemption proceeds by giving you securities. If the Fund redeems in kind, it generally will deliver to you a proportionate share of the portfolio securities owned by the Fund. Securities you receive this way may increase or decrease in value while you hold them and you may incur brokerage and transaction charges and tax liability when you convert the securities to cash. The Fund may redeem in kind at a shareholder’s request or if, for example, the Fund reasonably believes that a cash redemption may have a substantial impact on the Fund and its remaining shareholders.

During periods of deteriorating or stressed market conditions, when an increased portion of the Fund’s portfolio may be comprised of less-liquid investments, or during extraordinary or emergency circumstances, the Fund may be more likely to pay redemption proceeds with cash obtained through short-term borrowing arrangements (if available) or by giving you securities.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your request to sell shares to the Fund’s transfer agent. Please note that your investment firm may have its own earlier deadlines for the receipt of a request to sell shares. Consult your investment professional for more information. The Fund has authorized the Distributor to act as its agent in the repurchase of Fund shares

from qualified investment firms. The Fund reserves the right to terminate this procedure at any time.

By Phone or Online

If you have an eligible non-retirement account, you may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by phone or online. You may sell Fund shares held in a retirement plan account by phone only if your account is an eligible IRA (tax penalties may apply). You may not sell your shares by phone or online if you have changed your address (for checks) or your bank information (for wires and transfers) in the last 30 days.

You may receive your sale proceeds:

■By check, provided the check is made payable exactly as your account is registered

■By bank wire or by electronic funds transfer, provided the sale proceeds are being sent to your bank address of record

For Class Y shares, shareholders may sell up to $5 million per account per day if the proceeds are directed to your bank account of record ($100,000 per account per day if the proceeds are not directed to your bank account of record).

In Writing, by Mail, or by Fax

You can sell some or all of your Fund shares by writing directly to the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. Include in your request your name, the Fund’s name, your Fund account number, the class of shares to be sold, the dollar amount or number of shares to be sold and any other applicable requirements as described below. The Fund’s transfer agent will send the sale proceeds to your address of record unless you provide other instructions. Your request must be signed by all registered owners and be in good order.

The Fund’s transfer agent will not process your request until it is received in good order. You may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by fax.

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of redemption requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

In addition, the following policies regarding Account Options remain in force until the Effective Date.

Account Options

See the account application form for more details on each of the following services or call the Fund for details and availability.

Telephone Transaction Privileges

If your account is registered in your name, you can buy, exchange or sell Fund shares by telephone. If you do not want your account to have telephone transaction privileges, you must indicate that choice on your account application or by writing to the Fund.

When you request a telephone transaction the Fund’s transfer agent will try to confirm that the request is genuine. The transfer agent records the call, requires the caller to provide validating information for the account and sends you a written confirmation. The Fund may implement other confirmation procedures from time to time. Different procedures may apply if you have a non-U.S. account or if your account is registered in the name of an institution, broker-dealer or other third party. If the Fund’s confirmation procedures are followed, neither the Fund nor its agents will bear any liability for these transactions.

Online Transaction Privileges

If your account is registered in your name, you may be able to buy, exchange or sell Fund shares online. Your investment firm may also be able to buy, exchange or sell your Fund shares online.

To establish online transaction privileges:

■For new accounts, complete the online section of the account application

■For existing accounts, complete an account options form, write to the Fund or complete the online authorization screen at vcm.com

To use online transactions, you must read and agree to the terms of an online transaction agreement available on the Victory Funds website. When you or your investment firm requests an online transaction, the Fund’s transfer agent electronically records the transaction, requires an authorizing password and sends a written confirmation. The Fund may implement other procedures from time to time.

Different procedures may apply if you have a non-U.S. account or if your account is registered in the name of an institution, broker-dealer or other third party. You may not be able to use the online transaction privilege for certain types of accounts, including most retirement accounts.

Periodic Investments

You can make periodic investments in the Fund by setting up monthly bank drafts, government allotments, payroll deductions, or an Automatic Investment Plan.

Periodic investments may be made only through U.S. banks. You may use a periodic investment plan to establish a Class A share account with a small initial investment. If you have a Class C or Class R share account and your balance is at least $1,000, you may establish a periodic investment plan.

Automatic Investment Plan (AIP)

If you establish an Automatic Investment Plan with the Adviser, the Fund’s transfer agent will make a periodic investment in Fund shares by means of a preauthorized electronic Funds transfer from your bank account. Your plan investments are voluntary. You may discontinue your plan at any time or change the plan’s dollar amount, frequency or investment date by calling or writing to the Fund’s transfer agent. You should allow up to 30 days for the Fund’s transfer agent to establish your plan.

Automatic Exchanges

You can automatically exchange your Fund shares for shares of the same class of another Fund in the Victory Funds complex. The automatic exchange will begin on the day you select when you complete the appropriate section of your account application or an account options form. In order to establish automatic exchange:

■You must select exchanges on a monthly or quarterly basis

■Both the originating and receiving accounts must have identical registrations

■The originating account must have a minimum balance of $5,000. You may have to pay income taxes on an exchange.

Distribution Options

The Fund offers three distribution options. Any Fund shares you buy by reinvesting distributions will be priced at the applicable net asset value per share.

■Unless you indicate another option on your account application, any dividends and capital gain distributions paid to you by the Fund will automatically be invested in additional Fund shares.

■You may elect to have the amount of any dividends paid to you in cash and any capital gain distributions reinvested in additional shares.

■You may elect to have the full amount of any dividends and/or capital gain distributions paid to you in cash.

Options (2) and (3) are not available to retirement plan accounts or accounts with a current value of less than $500. When electing a cash distribution option, you may only select one destination for the cash distribution portion (i.e., bank account or directed to another mutual fund). The other distribution portion must be reinvested into your current mutual fund account or follow the same cash election.

If your distribution check is returned to the Fund’s transfer agent or you do not cash the check for six months or more, the Fund’s transfer agent may reinvest the amount of the check in your account and automatically change the distribution option on your account to option (1) until you request a different option in writing. If the amount of a distribution check would be less than $25, the Fund may reinvest the amount in additional shares of the Fund instead of sending a check. Additional shares of the Fund will be purchased at the then- current net asset value.

Directed Dividends

You can invest the dividends paid by your Fund accounts in a second Victory Funds account. The value of your second account must be at least $1,000. You may direct the investment of any amount of dividends. There are no fees or charges for directed dividends.

Systematic Withdrawal Plans

When you establish a systematic withdrawal plan for your account, the transfer agent will sell the number of Fund shares you specify on a periodic basis and the proceeds will be paid to you or to any person you select. You must obtain a signature guarantee to direct payments to another person after you have established your systematic withdrawal plan. Payments can be made either by check or by electronic transfer to a U.S. bank account you designate.

To establish a systematic withdrawal plan:

■Your account must have a total value of at least $10,000 when you establish your plan

■You may not request a periodic withdrawal of more than 10% of the value of any

Class C or Class R share account (valued at the time the plan is implemented)

These requirements do not apply to scheduled (Internal Revenue Code Section 72(t) election) or mandatory (required minimum distribution) withdrawals from IRAs and certain retirement plans.

Systematic sales of Fund shares may be taxable transactions for you. While you are making systematic withdrawals from your account, you may pay unnecessary initial sales charges on additional purchases of Class A shares or contingent deferred sales charges.

Direct Deposit

If you elect to take dividends or dividends and capital gain distributions in cash, or if you establish a systematic withdrawal plan, you may choose to have those cash payments deposited directly into your savings, checking or NOW bank account.

Voluntary Tax Withholding

You may have the Fund’s transfer agent withhold 28% of the dividends and capital gain distributions paid from your Fund account (before any reinvestment) and forward the amount withheld to the Internal Revenue Service as a credit against your federal income taxes. Voluntary tax withholding is not available for retirement plan accounts or for accounts subject to backup withholding.

In addition, the following policies regarding Shareholder Services and Policies remain in force until the Effective Date.

Shareholder Services and Policies

Purchases in Kind

You may use securities you own to purchase shares of the Fund provided that the Adviser, in its sole discretion, determines that the securities are consistent with the Fund’s objective and policies and their acquisition is in the best interests of the Fund. If the Fund accepts your securities, they will be valued for purposes of determining the number of Fund shares to be issued to you in the same way the Fund will value the securities for purposes of determining its net asset value. For federal income tax purposes, you may be taxed in the same manner

as if you sold the securities that you use to purchase Fund shares for cash in an amount equal to the value of the Fund shares that you purchase. Your broker may also impose a fee in connection with processing your purchase of Fund shares with securities.

Reinstatement Privilege (Class A shares)

If you recently sold all or part of your Class A shares, you may be able to reinvest all or part of your sale proceeds without a sales charge in Class A shares of any Victory Funds. To qualify for reinstatement:

■You must send a written request to the Fund no more than 90 days after selling your shares and

■The registration of the account in which you reinvest your sale proceeds must be identical to the registration of the account from which you sold your shares.

Purchases pursuant to the reinstatement privilege are subject to limitations on investor transactions, including the limitation on the purchase of the Fund’s shares within 30 calendar days of redemption.

When you elect reinstatement, you are subject to the provisions outlined in the selected fund’s prospectus, including the Fund’s minimum investment requirement. Your sale proceeds will be reinvested in shares of the Fund at the Class A net asset value per share determined after the Fund receives your written request for reinstatement. You may realize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of your sale of Fund shares, and special tax rules may apply if you elect reinstatement. Consult your tax adviser for more information.

December 31, 2025

Victory Pioneer Disciplined Value Fund (the “Fund”)

Supplement to the Fund’s Prospectus dated December 31, 2025, as in effect and as may be amended from time to time.

On September 30, 2025, the Board of Trustees of the Fund, upon the recommendation of Victory Capital Management Inc., the Fund’s investment adviser (“Victory Capital”), approved a change in the Fund’s custodian, sub-administrator, sub-fund accountant, and transfer agent to be effective close of business on or about February 6, 2026 (the “Effective Date”).

As of the Effective Date, FIS Investor Services LLC (“FIS”) will serve as transfer agent of the Fund. In connection with this change and following the Effective Date, shareholders may be able to reduce or eliminate the sales charge applicable to Class A shares of the Fund through a letter of intent or right of accumulation that includes other funds not managed by Victory Capital, in addition to funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise. Moreover, shares of a Fund, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of the same class of another fund in the Victory Funds mutual fund complex, including funds that are not managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise.

Prior to the Effective Date, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. serves as the Fund’s transfer agent. Until the Effective Date, all references in the Prospectus to FIS Investor Services LLC as the Fund’s transfer agent are deleted and replaced with references to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc.

Prior to the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-225-6292. After the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-539-FUND (1-800-539-3863).

Until the Effective Date, the following modifies (and if inconsistent, replaces) the information appearing in the Letter of Intent and Right of Accumulation bullet points of the Prospectus section “Choosing a Share Class”:

Letter of Intent - If you anticipate purchasing $50,000 or more of Class A shares of the Fund, including any purchase of other funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise (each, a “Victory Pioneer Fund”) of any share class (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans), within a 13-month period, you may qualify for a sales charge breakpoint as though you were investing the total amount in one lump sum. In order to qualify for the reduced sales charge, you must submit a non- binding Letter of Intent (the “Letter”) within 90 days of the start of the purchases. Each investment you make after signing the Letter will be entitled to the sales charge applicable to the total investment indicated in the Letter. You must start with a minimum initial investment of at least 5.00% of the total amount you intend to purchase. A portion of the shares purchased under the Letter will be held in escrow until the total investment has been completed. In the event you do not complete your commitment set forth in the Letter in the time period specified, sufficient escrowed shares will be redeemed to pay any applicable front-end sales charges;

Right of Accumulation - Whereas a Letter of Intent allows you to qualify for a discount by combining your current purchase amount with purchases you intend to make in the near future, a Right of Accumulation allows you to reduce the initial sales charge on a Class A investment by combining the amount of your current purchase with the current market value of prior investments made by you, your spouse (including domestic partner), and your

children under age 21 in any class of shares of any Victory Pioneer Fund (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans). The value of eligible existing holdings will be calculated by using the greater of the current value or the original investment amount. To ensure that you receive a reduced price using the Fund’s Right of Accumulation, you or your Investment Professional must inform the Funds that the Right applies each time shares are purchased and provide sufficient information to permit confirmation of qualification;

In addition, the following policies regarding Buying, Exchanging and Selling Shares remain in force until the Effective Date.

Buying, Exchanging, and Selling Shares

The Fund is generally available for purchase in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the Fund’s Distributor, the Fund will only accept accounts from U.S. citizens with a U.S. address (including an APO or FPO address) or resident aliens with a U.S. address (including an APO or FPO address) and a U.S. taxpayer identification number.

Identity Verification

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When you open an account, you will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the Fund to identify you.

The Fund may close your account if we cannot adequately verify your identity. The redemption price will be the net asset value on the date of redemption.

Investing Through Financial Intermediaries and Retirement Plans

If you invest in the Fund through your financial intermediary or through a retirement plan, the options and services available to you may be different from those discussed in this

prospectus. Shareholders investing through financial intermediaries, programs sponsored by financial intermediaries and retirement plans may only purchase funds and classes of shares that are available. When you invest through an account that is not in your name, you generally may buy and sell shares and complete other transactions only through the account. Ask your investment professional or financial intermediary for more information.

Additional conditions may apply to your investment in the Fund, and the investment professional or intermediary may charge you a transaction-based, administrative or other fee for its services. These conditions and fees are in addition to those imposed by the Fund and its affiliates. You should ask your investment professional or financial intermediary about its services and any applicable fees.

Share Prices for Transactions

If you place an order to purchase, exchange or sell shares that is received in good order by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent by the close of regular trading on the NYSE (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time), the share price for your transaction will be based on the net asset value determined as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE on that day (plus or minus any applicable sales charges). If your order is received by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent after the close of regular trading on the NYSE, or your order is not in good order, the share price will be based on the net asset value next determined after your order is received in good order by the Fund or authorized agent. The authorized agent is responsible for transmitting your order to the Fund in a timely manner.

Good order means that:

■You have provided adequate instructions

■There are no outstanding claims against your account

■There are no transaction limitations on your account

■Your request includes a signature guarantee if you:

■Are selling over $100,000 or exchanging over $500,000 worth of shares

■Changed your account registration or address within the last 30 days

■Instruct the transfer agent to mail the check to an address different from the one on your account

■Want the check paid to someone other than the account’s record owner(s)

■Are transferring the sale proceeds to a Victory Fund account with a different registration

Transaction Limitations

Your transactions are subject to certain limitations, including the limitation on the purchase of the Fund’s shares within 30 calendar days of a redemption.

Buying

You may buy Fund shares from any financial intermediary that has a sales agreement or other arrangement with the Distributor.

You can buy shares at net asset value per share plus any applicable sales charge. The Distributor may reject any order until it has confirmed the order in writing and received payment. Normally, your financial intermediary will send your purchase request to the Fund’s transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

Minimum Investment Amounts

If you would like to buy Class A or Class C shares, the minimum investment required to open an account is $2,500 ($1,000 for IRA accounts), with additional investments of at least $50. If you would like to buy Class R6, Class R, or Class Y shares, you must be an Eligible Investor, as discussed in the section Choosing a Share Class — Eligibility Requirements to Purchase. Eligible Investors may be subject to a minimum investment amount as detailed in that section.

For Class C shares, individual purchases of $250,000 and above will be made automatically in Class A shares.

If your account falls below the minimum investment amount, we may ask you to reestablish the minimum investment. If you do not do so within 60 days, we may close your account and send you the value of your account.

The minimum investment required to open an account may be waived or lowered for employees and immediate family members of the employees, of the Adviser, the Administrator, and their affiliates. In addition, the minimum investment required may be waived when the Fund is purchased through an Advisory Program, within qualified retirement plans or in other similar circumstances. Although the Fund may sometimes waive the minimum investment, when it does so, it always reserves the right to reject initial investments under the minimum at its discretion.

How to Buy Shares

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your purchase request to the Distributor and/or transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

By Phone or Online

You can use the telephone or online purchase privilege if you have an existing non- retirement account. Certain IRAs can use the telephone purchase privilege. If your account is eligible, you can purchase additional Fund shares by phone or online if:

■You established your bank account of record at least 30 days ago

■Your bank information has not changed for at least 30 days

■You are not purchasing more than $100,000 worth of shares per account per day

■You can provide the proper account identification information

When you request a telephone or online purchase, the Fund’s transfer agent will electronically debit the amount of the purchase from your bank account of record. The Fund’s transfer agent will purchase Fund shares for the amount of the debit at the offering price determined after the Fund’s transfer agent receives your telephone or online purchase instruction and good funds. It usually takes three business days for the Fund’s transfer agent to receive notification from your bank that good funds are available in the amount of your investment.

In Writing, by Mail

You can purchase Fund shares for an existing Fund account by mailing a check to the Fund. Make your check payable to the Fund. Neither initial nor subsequent investments should be made by third party check, travelers check, or credit card check. Your check must be in U.S. dollars and drawn on a U.S. bank. Include in your purchase request the Fund’s name, the account number and the name or names in the account registration. Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of purchase orders submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

By Wire (Class R6 or Class Y shares only)

If you have an existing (Class R6 or Class Y shares only) account, you may wire funds to purchase shares. Note, however, that:

■BNY Mellon must receive your wire no later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on the business day after the Fund receives your request to purchase shares

■If BNY Mellon does not receive your wire by 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on the next business day, your transaction will be canceled at your expense and risk

■Wire transfers normally take two or more hours to complete and a fee may be charged by the sending bank

■Wire transfers may be restricted on holidays and at certain other times

Instruct Your Bank to Wire Funds to:

Receiving Bank: BNY Mellon, NA

ABA Routing No. 011001234

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. as agent FBO

Victory Pioneer Funds Consolidated Account

For further credit to:[Shareholder Name

Existing Victory Pioneer Account No.

Fund Name]

The Fund’s transfer agent must receive your account application before you send your initial check or federal funds wire. In addition, you must provide a bank wire address of record when you establish your account.

How to Exchange Shares

You may, under certain circumstances, exchange your shares for shares of the same class of another Victory Pioneer Fund. At this time, shares of a Victory Pioneer Fund may only be exchanged for the same share class of another Victory Pioneer Fund.

Your exchange request must be for at least $1,000. The Fund allows you to exchange your shares at net asset value without charging you either an initial or contingent deferred sales charge at the time of the exchange. Shares you acquire as part of an exchange will continue to be subject to any contingent deferred sales charge that applies to the shares you originally purchased. When you ultimately sell your shares, the date of your original purchase will determine your contingent deferred sales charge.

Before you request an exchange, consider each fund’s investment objective(s) and policies as described in the Fund’s prospectus. You generally will have to pay income taxes on an exchange.

Same-Fund Exchange Privilege

Certain shareholders may be eligible to exchange their shares for shares of another class. If eligible, no sales charges or other charges will apply to any such exchange. Generally, shareholders will not recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes upon such an exchange. Investors should contact their financial intermediary to learn more about the details of this privilege.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your exchange request to the Fund’s transfer agent.

Consult your investment professional for more information about exchanging your shares.

By Phone or Online

After you establish an eligible fund account, you can exchange Fund shares by phone or online if:

■You are exchanging into an existing account or using the exchange to establish a new account, provided the new account has a registration identical to the original account

■The Fund into which you are exchanging offers the same class of shares

■You are not exchanging more than $500,000 worth of shares per account per day

■You can provide the proper account identification information

In Writing, by Mail, or by Fax

You can exchange Fund shares by mailing or faxing a letter of instruction to the Fund. You can exchange Fund shares directly through the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. However, you may not fax an exchange request for more than $500,000. Include in your letter:

■The name and signature of all registered owners

■A signature guarantee for each registered owner if the amount of the exchange is more than $500,000

■The name of the Fund out of which you are exchanging and the name of the Fund into which you are exchanging

■The class of shares you are exchanging

■The dollar amount or number of shares you are exchanging

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of exchange requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

How to Sell Shares

Your shares will be sold at the share price (net asset value less any applicable sales charge) next calculated after the Fund or its authorized agent, such as a broker-dealer, receives your request in good order. If a signature guarantee is required, you must submit your request in writing.

If the shares you are selling are subject to a deferred sales charge, it will be deducted from the sale proceeds. The Fund generally will send your sale proceeds by check, bank wire or electronic funds transfer. Your redemption proceeds normally will be sent within 1 business

day after your request is received in good order, but in any event within 7 days, regardless of the method the Fund uses to make such payment. If you recently sent a check to purchase the shares being sold, the Fund may delay payment of the sale proceeds until your check has cleared. This may take up to 10 calendar days from the purchase date.

Your redemption proceeds may be delayed, or your right to receive redemption proceeds suspended, if the NYSE is closed (other than on weekends or holidays) or trading is restricted, if the SEC determines an emergency or other circumstances exist that make it impracticable for the Fund to sell or value its portfolio securities, or otherwise as permitted by the rules of or by the order of the SEC.

If you are selling shares from a non-retirement account or certain IRAs, you may use any of the methods described below. If you are selling shares from a retirement account other than an IRA, you must make your request in writing.

You generally will have to pay income taxes on a sale.

If you must use a written request to exchange or sell your shares and your account is registered in the name of a corporation or other fiduciary you must include the name of an authorized person and a certified copy of a current corporate resolution, certificate of incumbency or similar legal document showing that the named individual is authorized to act on behalf of the record owner.

Under normal circumstances, the Fund expects to meet redemption requests by using cash or cash equivalents in its portfolio and/or selling portfolio assets to generate cash. Under stressed or abnormal market conditions or circumstances, including circumstances adversely affecting the liquidity of the Fund’s investments, the Fund may be more likely to be forced to sell portfolio assets to meet redemptions than under normal market circumstances. Under such circumstances, the Fund could be forced to liquidate assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value. The Fund also may pay redemption proceeds using cash obtained through a committed, unsecured revolving credit facility, or an interfund lending facility, if available, and other borrowing arrangements that may be available from time to time.

The Fund reserves the right to redeem in kind, that is, to pay all or a portion of your redemption proceeds by giving you securities. If the Fund redeems in kind, it generally will deliver to you a proportionate share of the portfolio securities owned by the Fund. Securities you receive this way may increase or decrease in value while you hold them and you may incur brokerage and transaction charges and tax liability when you convert the securities to cash. The Fund may redeem in kind at a shareholder’s request or if, for example, the Fund reasonably believes that a cash redemption may have a substantial impact on the Fund and its remaining shareholders.

During periods of deteriorating or stressed market conditions, when an increased portion of the Fund’s portfolio may be comprised of less-liquid investments, or during extraordinary or emergency circumstances, the Fund may be more likely to pay redemption proceeds with cash obtained through short-term borrowing arrangements (if available) or by giving you securities.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your request to sell shares to the Fund’s transfer agent. Please note that your investment firm may have its own earlier deadlines for the receipt of a request to sell shares. Consult your investment professional for more information. The Fund has authorized the Distributor to act as its agent in the repurchase of Fund shares

from qualified investment firms. The Fund reserves the right to terminate this procedure at any time.

By Phone or Online

If you have an eligible non-retirement account, you may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by phone or online. You may sell Fund shares held in a retirement plan account by phone only if your account is an eligible IRA (tax penalties may apply). You may not sell your shares by phone or online if you have changed your address (for checks) or your bank information (for wires and transfers) in the last 30 days.

You may receive your sale proceeds:

■By check, provided the check is made payable exactly as your account is registered

■By bank wire or by electronic funds transfer, provided the sale proceeds are being sent to your bank address of record

For Class Y shares, shareholders may sell up to $5 million per account per day if the proceeds are directed to your bank account of record ($100,000 per account per day if the proceeds are not directed to your bank account of record).

In Writing, by Mail, or by Fax

You can sell some or all of your Fund shares by writing directly to the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. Include in your request your name, the Fund’s name, your Fund account number, the class of shares to be sold, the dollar amount or number of shares to be sold and any other applicable requirements as described below. The Fund’s transfer agent will send the sale proceeds to your address of record unless you provide other instructions. Your request must be signed by all registered owners and be in good order.

The Fund’s transfer agent will not process your request until it is received in good order. You may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by fax.

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of redemption requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

In addition, the following policies regarding Account Options remain in force until the Effective Date.

Account Options

See the account application form for more details on each of the following services or call the Fund for details and availability.

Telephone Transaction Privileges

If your account is registered in your name, you can buy, exchange or sell Fund shares by telephone. If you do not want your account to have telephone transaction privileges, you must indicate that choice on your account application or by writing to the Fund.

When you request a telephone transaction the Fund’s transfer agent will try to confirm that the request is genuine. The transfer agent records the call, requires the caller to provide validating information for the account and sends you a written confirmation. The Fund may implement other confirmation procedures from time to time. Different procedures may apply if you have a non-U.S. account or if your account is registered in the name of an institution, broker-dealer or other third party. If the Fund’s confirmation procedures are followed, neither the Fund nor its agents will bear any liability for these transactions.

Online Transaction Privileges

If your account is registered in your name, you may be able to buy, exchange or sell Fund shares online. Your investment firm may also be able to buy, exchange or sell your Fund shares online.

To establish online transaction privileges:

■For new accounts, complete the online section of the account application

■For existing accounts, complete an account options form, write to the Fund or complete the online authorization screen at vcm.com

To use online transactions, you must read and agree to the terms of an online transaction agreement available on the Victory Funds website. When you or your investment firm requests an online transaction, the Fund’s transfer agent electronically records the transaction, requires an authorizing password and sends a written confirmation. The Fund may implement other procedures from time to time.

Different procedures may apply if you have a non-U.S. account or if your account is registered in the name of an institution, broker-dealer or other third party. You may not be able to use the online transaction privilege for certain types of accounts, including most retirement accounts.

Periodic Investments

You can make periodic investments in the Fund by setting up monthly bank drafts, government allotments, payroll deductions, or an Automatic Investment Plan.

Periodic investments may be made only through U.S. banks. You may use a periodic investment plan to establish a Class A share account with a small initial investment. If you have a Class C or Class R share account and your balance is at least $1,000, you may establish a periodic investment plan.

Automatic Investment Plan (AIP)

If you establish an Automatic Investment Plan with the Adviser, the Fund’s transfer agent will make a periodic investment in Fund shares by means of a preauthorized electronic Funds transfer from your bank account. Your plan investments are voluntary. You may discontinue your plan at any time or change the plan’s dollar amount, frequency or investment date by calling or writing to the Fund’s transfer agent. You should allow up to 30 days for the Fund’s transfer agent to establish your plan.

Automatic Exchanges

You can automatically exchange your Fund shares for shares of the same class of another Fund in the Victory Funds complex. The automatic exchange will begin on the day you select when you complete the appropriate section of your account application or an account options form. In order to establish automatic exchange:

■You must select exchanges on a monthly or quarterly basis

■Both the originating and receiving accounts must have identical registrations

■The originating account must have a minimum balance of $5,000. You may have to pay income taxes on an exchange.

Distribution Options

The Fund offers three distribution options. Any Fund shares you buy by reinvesting distributions will be priced at the applicable net asset value per share.

■Unless you indicate another option on your account application, any dividends and capital gain distributions paid to you by the Fund will automatically be invested in additional Fund shares.

■You may elect to have the amount of any dividends paid to you in cash and any capital gain distributions reinvested in additional shares.

■You may elect to have the full amount of any dividends and/or capital gain distributions paid to you in cash.

Options (2) and (3) are not available to retirement plan accounts or accounts with a current value of less than $500. When electing a cash distribution option, you may only select one destination for the cash distribution portion (i.e., bank account or directed to another mutual fund). The other distribution portion must be reinvested into your current mutual fund account or follow the same cash election.

If your distribution check is returned to the Fund’s transfer agent or you do not cash the check for six months or more, the Fund’s transfer agent may reinvest the amount of the check in your account and automatically change the distribution option on your account to option (1) until you request a different option in writing. If the amount of a distribution check would be less than $25, the Fund may reinvest the amount in additional shares of the Fund instead of sending a check. Additional shares of the Fund will be purchased at the then- current net asset value.

Directed Dividends

You can invest the dividends paid by your Fund accounts in a second Victory Funds account. The value of your second account must be at least $1,000. You may direct the investment of any amount of dividends. There are no fees or charges for directed dividends.

Systematic Withdrawal Plans

When you establish a systematic withdrawal plan for your account, the transfer agent will sell the number of Fund shares you specify on a periodic basis and the proceeds will be paid to you or to any person you select. You must obtain a signature guarantee to direct payments to another person after you have established your systematic withdrawal plan. Payments can be made either by check or by electronic transfer to a U.S. bank account you designate.

To establish a systematic withdrawal plan:

■Your account must have a total value of at least $10,000 when you establish your plan

■You may not request a periodic withdrawal of more than 10% of the value of any

Class C or Class R share account (valued at the time the plan is implemented)

These requirements do not apply to scheduled (Internal Revenue Code Section 72(t) election) or mandatory (required minimum distribution) withdrawals from IRAs and certain retirement plans.

Systematic sales of Fund shares may be taxable transactions for you. While you are making systematic withdrawals from your account, you may pay unnecessary initial sales charges on additional purchases of Class A shares or contingent deferred sales charges.

Direct Deposit

If you elect to take dividends or dividends and capital gain distributions in cash, or if you establish a systematic withdrawal plan, you may choose to have those cash payments deposited directly into your savings, checking or NOW bank account.

Voluntary Tax Withholding

You may have the Fund’s transfer agent withhold 28% of the dividends and capital gain distributions paid from your Fund account (before any reinvestment) and forward the amount withheld to the Internal Revenue Service as a credit against your federal income taxes. Voluntary tax withholding is not available for retirement plan accounts or for accounts subject to backup withholding.

In addition, the following policies regarding Shareholder Services and Policies remain in force until the Effective Date.

Shareholder Services and Policies

Purchases in Kind

You may use securities you own to purchase shares of the Fund provided that the Adviser, in its sole discretion, determines that the securities are consistent with the Fund’s objective and policies and their acquisition is in the best interests of the Fund. If the Fund accepts your securities, they will be valued for purposes of determining the number of Fund shares to be issued to you in the same way the Fund will value the securities for purposes of determining its net asset value. For federal income tax purposes, you may be taxed in the same manner

as if you sold the securities that you use to purchase Fund shares for cash in an amount equal to the value of the Fund shares that you purchase. Your broker may also impose a fee in connection with processing your purchase of Fund shares with securities.

Reinstatement Privilege (Class A shares)

If you recently sold all or part of your Class A shares, you may be able to reinvest all or part of your sale proceeds without a sales charge in Class A shares of any Victory Funds. To qualify for reinstatement:

■You must send a written request to the Fund no more than 90 days after selling your shares and

■The registration of the account in which you reinvest your sale proceeds must be identical to the registration of the account from which you sold your shares.

Purchases pursuant to the reinstatement privilege are subject to limitations on investor transactions, including the limitation on the purchase of the Fund’s shares within 30 calendar days of redemption.

When you elect reinstatement, you are subject to the provisions outlined in the selected fund’s prospectus, including the Fund’s minimum investment requirement. Your sale proceeds will be reinvested in shares of the Fund at the Class A net asset value per share determined after the Fund receives your written request for reinstatement. You may realize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of your sale of Fund shares, and special tax rules may apply if you elect reinstatement. Consult your tax adviser for more information.

December 31, 2025

Victory Pioneer Global Equity Fund (the “Fund”)

Supplement to the Fund’s Prospectus dated December 31, 2025, as in effect and as may be amended from time to time.

On September 30, 2025, the Board of Trustees of the Fund, upon the recommendation of Victory Capital Management Inc., the Fund’s investment adviser (“Victory Capital”), approved a change in the Fund’s custodian, sub-administrator, sub-fund accountant, and transfer agent to be effective close of business on or about February 6, 2026 (the “Effective Date”).

As of the Effective Date, FIS Investor Services LLC (“FIS”) will serve as transfer agent of the Fund. In connection with this change and following the Effective Date, shareholders may be able to reduce or eliminate the sales charge applicable to Class A shares of the Fund through a letter of intent or right of accumulation that includes other funds not managed by Victory Capital, in addition to funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise. Moreover, shares of a Fund, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of the same class of another fund in the Victory Funds mutual fund complex, including funds that are not managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise.

Prior to the Effective Date, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. serves as the Fund’s transfer agent. Until the Effective Date, all references in the Prospectus to FIS Investor Services LLC as the Fund’s transfer agent are deleted and replaced with references to BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc.

Prior to the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-225-6292. After the Effective Date, the customer service number is 1-800-539-FUND (1-800-539-3863).

Until the Effective Date, the following modifies (and if inconsistent, replaces) the information appearing in the Letter of Intent and Right of Accumulation bullet points of the Prospectus section “Choosing a Share Class”:

Letter of Intent - If you anticipate purchasing $50,000 or more of Class A shares of the Fund, including any purchase of other funds managed by Victory Capital’s Pioneer Investments franchise (each, a “Victory Pioneer Fund”) of any share class (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans), within a 13-month period, you may qualify for a sales charge breakpoint as though you were investing the total amount in one lump sum. In order to qualify for the reduced sales charge, you must submit a non- binding Letter of Intent (the “Letter”) within 90 days of the start of the purchases. Each investment you make after signing the Letter will be entitled to the sales charge applicable to the total investment indicated in the Letter. You must start with a minimum initial investment of at least 5.00% of the total amount you intend to purchase. A portion of the shares purchased under the Letter will be held in escrow until the total investment has been completed. In the event you do not complete your commitment set forth in the Letter in the time period specified, sufficient escrowed shares will be redeemed to pay any applicable front-end sales charges;

Right of Accumulation - Whereas a Letter of Intent allows you to qualify for a discount by combining your current purchase amount with purchases you intend to make in the near future, a Right of Accumulation allows you to reduce the initial sales charge on a Class A investment by combining the amount of your current purchase with the current market value of prior investments made by you, your spouse (including domestic partner), and your

children under age 21 in any class of shares of any Victory Pioneer Fund (except money market funds and any assets held in group retirement plans). The value of eligible existing holdings will be calculated by using the greater of the current value or the original investment amount. To ensure that you receive a reduced price using the Fund’s Right of Accumulation, you or your Investment Professional must inform the Funds that the Right applies each time shares are purchased and provide sufficient information to permit confirmation of qualification;

In addition, the following policies regarding Buying, Exchanging and Selling Shares remain in force until the Effective Date.

Buying, Exchanging, and Selling Shares

The Fund is generally available for purchase in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Except to the extent otherwise permitted by the Fund’s Distributor, the Fund will only accept accounts from U.S. citizens with a U.S. address (including an APO or FPO address) or resident aliens with a U.S. address (including an APO or FPO address) and a U.S. taxpayer identification number.

Identity Verification

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When you open an account, you will need to supply your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the Fund to identify you.

The Fund may close your account if we cannot adequately verify your identity. The redemption price will be the net asset value on the date of redemption.

Investing Through Financial Intermediaries and Retirement Plans

If you invest in the Fund through your financial intermediary or through a retirement plan, the options and services available to you may be different from those discussed in this

prospectus. Shareholders investing through financial intermediaries, programs sponsored by financial intermediaries and retirement plans may only purchase funds and classes of shares that are available. When you invest through an account that is not in your name, you generally may buy and sell shares and complete other transactions only through the account. Ask your investment professional or financial intermediary for more information.

Additional conditions may apply to your investment in the Fund, and the investment professional or intermediary may charge you a transaction-based, administrative or other fee for its services. These conditions and fees are in addition to those imposed by the Fund and its affiliates. You should ask your investment professional or financial intermediary about its services and any applicable fees.

Share Prices for Transactions

If you place an order to purchase, exchange or sell shares that is received in good order by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent by the close of regular trading on the NYSE (usually 4:00 p.m. Eastern time), the share price for your transaction will be based on the net asset value determined as of the close of regular trading on the NYSE on that day (plus or minus any applicable sales charges). If your order is received by the Fund’s transfer agent or an authorized agent after the close of regular trading on the NYSE, or your order is not in good order, the share price will be based on the net asset value next determined after your order is received in good order by the Fund or authorized agent. The authorized agent is responsible for transmitting your order to the Fund in a timely manner.

Good order means that:

■You have provided adequate instructions

■There are no outstanding claims against your account

■There are no transaction limitations on your account

■Your request includes a signature guarantee if you:

■Are selling over $100,000 or exchanging over $500,000 worth of shares

■Changed your account registration or address within the last 30 days

■Instruct the transfer agent to mail the check to an address different from the one on your account

■Want the check paid to someone other than the account’s record owner(s)

■Are transferring the sale proceeds to a Victory Fund account with a different registration

Transaction Limitations

Your transactions are subject to certain limitations, including the limitation on the purchase of the Fund’s shares within 30 calendar days of a redemption.

Buying

You may buy Fund shares from any financial intermediary that has a sales agreement or other arrangement with the Distributor.

You can buy shares at net asset value per share plus any applicable sales charge. The Distributor may reject any order until it has confirmed the order in writing and received payment. Normally, your financial intermediary will send your purchase request to the Fund’s transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

Minimum Investment Amounts

If you would like to buy Class A or Class C shares, the minimum investment required to open an account is $2,500 ($1,000 for IRA accounts), with additional investments of at least $50. If you would like to buy Class R6, Class R, or Class Y shares, you must be an Eligible Investor, as discussed in the section Choosing a Share Class — Eligibility Requirements to Purchase. Eligible Investors may be subject to a minimum investment amount as detailed in that section.

For Class C shares, individual purchases of $250,000 and above will be made automatically in Class A shares.

If your account falls below the minimum investment amount, we may ask you to reestablish the minimum investment. If you do not do so within 60 days, we may close your account and send you the value of your account.

The minimum investment required to open an account may be waived or lowered for employees and immediate family members of the employees, of the Adviser, the Administrator, and their affiliates. In addition, the minimum investment required may be waived when the Fund is purchased through an Advisory Program, within qualified retirement plans or in other similar circumstances. Although the Fund may sometimes waive the minimum investment, when it does so, it always reserves the right to reject initial investments under the minimum at its discretion.

How to Buy Shares

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your purchase request to the Distributor and/or transfer agent. Consult your investment professional for more information. Your investment firm receives a commission from the Distributor, and may receive additional compensation from the Adviser, for your purchase of Fund shares.

By Phone or Online

You can use the telephone or online purchase privilege if you have an existing non- retirement account. Certain IRAs can use the telephone purchase privilege. If your account is eligible, you can purchase additional Fund shares by phone or online if:

■You established your bank account of record at least 30 days ago

■Your bank information has not changed for at least 30 days

■You are not purchasing more than $100,000 worth of shares per account per day

■You can provide the proper account identification information

When you request a telephone or online purchase, the Fund’s transfer agent will electronically debit the amount of the purchase from your bank account of record. The Fund’s transfer agent will purchase Fund shares for the amount of the debit at the offering price determined after the Fund’s transfer agent receives your telephone or online purchase instruction and good funds. It usually takes three business days for the Fund’s transfer agent to receive notification from your bank that good funds are available in the amount of your investment.

In Writing, by Mail

You can purchase Fund shares for an existing Fund account by mailing a check to the Fund. Make your check payable to the Fund. Neither initial nor subsequent investments should be made by third party check, travelers check, or credit card check. Your check must be in U.S. dollars and drawn on a U.S. bank. Include in your purchase request the Fund’s name, the account number and the name or names in the account registration. Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of purchase orders submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

By Wire (Class R6 or Class Y shares only)

If you have an existing (Class R6 or Class Y shares only) account, you may wire funds to purchase shares. Note, however, that:

■BNY Mellon must receive your wire no later than 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on the business day after the Fund receives your request to purchase shares

■If BNY Mellon does not receive your wire by 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on the next business day, your transaction will be canceled at your expense and risk

■Wire transfers normally take two or more hours to complete and a fee may be charged by the sending bank

■Wire transfers may be restricted on holidays and at certain other times

Instruct Your Bank to Wire Funds to:

Receiving Bank: BNY Mellon, NA

ABA Routing No. 011001234

BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. as agent FBO

Victory Pioneer Funds Consolidated Account

Account 727296

For further credit to:[Shareholder Name

Existing Victory Pioneer Account No.

Fund Name]

The Fund’s transfer agent must receive your account application before you send your initial check or federal funds wire. In addition, you must provide a bank wire address of record when you establish your account.

How to Exchange Shares

You may, under certain circumstances, exchange your shares for shares of the same class of another Victory Pioneer Fund. At this time, shares of a Victory Pioneer Fund may only be exchanged for the same share class of another Victory Pioneer Fund.

Your exchange request must be for at least $1,000. The Fund allows you to exchange your shares at net asset value without charging you either an initial or contingent deferred sales charge at the time of the exchange. Shares you acquire as part of an exchange will continue to be subject to any contingent deferred sales charge that applies to the shares you originally purchased. When you ultimately sell your shares, the date of your original purchase will determine your contingent deferred sales charge.

Before you request an exchange, consider each fund’s investment objective(s) and policies as described in the Fund’s prospectus. You generally will have to pay income taxes on an exchange.

Same-Fund Exchange Privilege

Certain shareholders may be eligible to exchange their shares for shares of another class. If eligible, no sales charges or other charges will apply to any such exchange. Generally, shareholders will not recognize a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes upon such an exchange. Investors should contact their financial intermediary to learn more about the details of this privilege.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your exchange request to the Fund’s transfer agent.

Consult your investment professional for more information about exchanging your shares.

By Phone or Online

After you establish an eligible fund account, you can exchange Fund shares by phone or online if:

■You are exchanging into an existing account or using the exchange to establish a new account, provided the new account has a registration identical to the original account

■The Fund into which you are exchanging offers the same class of shares

■You are not exchanging more than $500,000 worth of shares per account per day

■You can provide the proper account identification information

In Writing, by Mail, or by Fax

You can exchange Fund shares by mailing or faxing a letter of instruction to the Fund. You can exchange Fund shares directly through the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. However, you may not fax an exchange request for more than $500,000. Include in your letter:

■The name and signature of all registered owners

■A signature guarantee for each registered owner if the amount of the exchange is more than $500,000

■The name of the Fund out of which you are exchanging and the name of the Fund into which you are exchanging

■The class of shares you are exchanging

■The dollar amount or number of shares you are exchanging

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of exchange requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

How to Sell Shares

Your shares will be sold at the share price (net asset value less any applicable sales charge) next calculated after the Fund or its authorized agent, such as a broker-dealer, receives your request in good order. If a signature guarantee is required, you must submit your request in writing.

If the shares you are selling are subject to a deferred sales charge, it will be deducted from the sale proceeds. The Fund generally will send your sale proceeds by check, bank wire or electronic funds transfer. Your redemption proceeds normally will be sent within 1 business

day after your request is received in good order, but in any event within 7 days, regardless of the method the Fund uses to make such payment. If you recently sent a check to purchase the shares being sold, the Fund may delay payment of the sale proceeds until your check has cleared. This may take up to 10 calendar days from the purchase date.

Your redemption proceeds may be delayed, or your right to receive redemption proceeds suspended, if the NYSE is closed (other than on weekends or holidays) or trading is restricted, if the SEC determines an emergency or other circumstances exist that make it impracticable for the Fund to sell or value its portfolio securities, or otherwise as permitted by the rules of or by the order of the SEC.

If you are selling shares from a non-retirement account or certain IRAs, you may use any of the methods described below. If you are selling shares from a retirement account other than an IRA, you must make your request in writing.

You generally will have to pay income taxes on a sale.

If you must use a written request to exchange or sell your shares and your account is registered in the name of a corporation or other fiduciary you must include the name of an authorized person and a certified copy of a current corporate resolution, certificate of incumbency or similar legal document showing that the named individual is authorized to act on behalf of the record owner.

Under normal circumstances, the Fund expects to meet redemption requests by using cash or cash equivalents in its portfolio and/or selling portfolio assets to generate cash. Under stressed or abnormal market conditions or circumstances, including circumstances adversely affecting the liquidity of the Fund’s investments, the Fund may be more likely to be forced to sell portfolio assets to meet redemptions than under normal market circumstances. Under such circumstances, the Fund could be forced to liquidate assets at inopportune times or at a loss or depressed value. The Fund also may pay redemption proceeds using cash obtained through a committed, unsecured revolving credit facility, or an interfund lending facility, if available, and other borrowing arrangements that may be available from time to time.

The Fund reserves the right to redeem in kind, that is, to pay all or a portion of your redemption proceeds by giving you securities. If the Fund redeems in kind, it generally will deliver to you a proportionate share of the portfolio securities owned by the Fund. Securities you receive this way may increase or decrease in value while you hold them and you may incur brokerage and transaction charges and tax liability when you convert the securities to cash. The Fund may redeem in kind at a shareholder’s request or if, for example, the Fund reasonably believes that a cash redemption may have a substantial impact on the Fund and its remaining shareholders.

During periods of deteriorating or stressed market conditions, when an increased portion of the Fund’s portfolio may be comprised of less-liquid investments, or during extraordinary or emergency circumstances, the Fund may be more likely to pay redemption proceeds with cash obtained through short-term borrowing arrangements (if available) or by giving you securities.

Through Your Investment Firm

Normally, your investment firm will send your request to sell shares to the Fund’s transfer agent. Please note that your investment firm may have its own earlier deadlines for the receipt of a request to sell shares. Consult your investment professional for more information. The Fund has authorized the Distributor to act as its agent in the repurchase of Fund shares

from qualified investment firms. The Fund reserves the right to terminate this procedure at any time.

By Phone or Online

If you have an eligible non-retirement account, you may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by phone or online. You may sell Fund shares held in a retirement plan account by phone only if your account is an eligible IRA (tax penalties may apply). You may not sell your shares by phone or online if you have changed your address (for checks) or your bank information (for wires and transfers) in the last 30 days.

You may receive your sale proceeds:

■By check, provided the check is made payable exactly as your account is registered

■By bank wire or by electronic funds transfer, provided the sale proceeds are being sent to your bank address of record

For Class Y shares, shareholders may sell up to $5 million per account per day if the proceeds are directed to your bank account of record ($100,000 per account per day if the proceeds are not directed to your bank account of record).

In Writing, by Mail, or by Fax

You can sell some or all of your Fund shares by writing directly to the Fund only if your account is registered in your name. Include in your request your name, the Fund’s name, your Fund account number, the class of shares to be sold, the dollar amount or number of shares to be sold and any other applicable requirements as described below. The Fund’s transfer agent will send the sale proceeds to your address of record unless you provide other instructions. Your request must be signed by all registered owners and be in good order.

The Fund’s transfer agent will not process your request until it is received in good order. You may sell up to $100,000 per account per day by fax.

Please note that there may be a delay in receipt by the Fund’s transfer agent of redemption requests submitted by regular mail to a post office address.

L’intesa è stata raggiunta con le organizzazioni sindacali Fabi, First, Physac, Uilca e Unisin e conferma la piena applicazione del Protocollo Abi a sostegno delle donne vittime di violenza, sottoscritto a novembre 2025. Tra le nuove assunzioni, 58 saranno dedicate a questa categoria, con le prime 20 previste già nel 2026.

Ricambio generazionale e investimenti sul capitale umano

Le uscite volontarie, pari a 484 posti full-time, derivano dalle iniziative complementari del piano industriale Unlocked e saranno compensate da 436 assunzioni in apprendistato professionalizing finalizzate al contratto a tempo indeterminato. Questi ingressi, riservati a giovani diplomati e laureati under 30, contribuiranno a rafforzare la rete commerciale della banca. Secondo quanto riferisce la Fabi, il totale delle nuove assunzioni raggiungerà 494, con un tasso di sostituzione del 102%, senza ricorso a contratti misti tra dipendente e autonomo.

Contrattazione d’anticipo e dialogo permanente

L’accordo introduce inoltre un nuovo strumento di contrattazione d’anticipo, con la nascita di un Comitato permanente per il dialogo e il confronto sulle attività aziendali. Questo organo avrà il compito di semplificare le procedure interne e valorizzare il percorso digitale della banca, rappresentando uno spazio stabile di confronto tra direzione e organizzazioni sindacali. Ilaria Dalla Riva, Responsabile People & Culture Italia e ceoo Italia di Unicredit, ha spiegato che l’intesa permette di continuare a investire sulle persone e sulla rete commerciale, ponendo attenzione sia al cliente sia al capitale umano.

La nuova governance di Unicredit

With the new governance introdotta dall’amministratore delegato Andrea Orcel, Unicredit ha avviato un cambiamento strutturale centrato sul cliente e sulle persone. La quota di under 35 in azienda è salita dal 7% al 15%, a conferma del ricambio generazionale in corso.

Contestualmente, sono stati avviati programmi di reskilling e upskilling dei dipendenti, con percorsi formativi sviluppati in collaborazione con Unicredit Corporate University, volti a rafforzare le competenze commerciali, relazionali e digitali. Il nuovo modello organizzativo ha modificato l’equilibrio tra funzioni centrali e rete commerciale, portando oggi il 70% delle risorse in rete e il 30% nelle funzioni centrali, a testimonianza di un approccio maggiormente orientato al cliente. Tra le initiatives strategiche vi sono la Career rotation per oltre il 35% del personale e l’automazione delle attività di back office, liberando l’equivalente del tempo di 2.500 persone da dedicare esclusivamente alla relazione con il cliente.

AI Assistants and Operational Efficiency Zara is also preparing to implement an AI-powered assistant to replace or complement its current search function.","Zara has implemented generative artificial intelligence to produce hyper-realistic images of human models and launch a virtual fitting room. The technology allows the retailer to overlay new collections onto existing photographs of models, accelerating the pace of digital catalog updates without requiring additional physical photo sessions.

Inditex, Zara’s parent company, characterizes the move as a tool to enhance efficiency and maintain a ""fresh"" online presence during high-rotation periods such as seasonal sales. The strategy follows similar announcements from competitors H&M and Zalando, who have also integrated AI-generated models and imagery into their marketing and operations.

“We are using artificial intelligence only to complement our existing processes,” an Inditex spokesperson said in a statement. “We work in collaboration with our valued models, agreeing on any aspect on a mutual basis, and we compensate according to industry best practices.”

Reports indicate that Zara seeks approval from models to edit their images with AI and provides compensation equivalent to the fee of a second photography session.

Back in June, the company reported a 1.5% increase in sales during 1Q25, reaching €8.27 billion (MX$179 billion). The result fell short of analyst expectations of €8.36 billion and marked a slowdown from the 7% growth recorded in the same period last year. The company attributed the more subdued performance to cooler weather in key markets, including Spain, where approximately 15% of its global sales originate, and ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.

Despite slower revenue growth, Inditex maintained a gross margin of 60.6% and recorded a net profit of €1.31 billion, a slight year-on-year increase. The group, which also owns brands such as Massimo Dutti, Stradivarius, Bershka, and Pull&Bear, emphasized operational resilience and highlighted early signs of recovery.

Virtual Fitting Room and Generative Avatars

Expanding its ""omnichannel experience"" strategy, Zara recently activated a new ""virtual fitting room"" in the Spanish market following its launch in Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy. Accessible exclusively via the official Zara app, the tool utilizes generative AI to create hyper-realistic simulations of how garments fit a user's specific body.

The process requires users to provide two photographs: a selfie and a full-body image. The AI then generates a personal avatar in approximately two minutes, providing both a high-resolution photograph and a 360-degree video recreation of the avatar wearing the selected items.

Industry analysts suggest this tool has the potential to reduce return rates and increase the average ticket size. By generating a ""total look,"" the app encourages users to purchase complete outfits suggested by the AI rather than single items.

AI Assistants and Operational Efficiency

Zara is also preparing to implement an AI-powered assistant to replace or complement its current search function. Already active in several international markets, the assistant allows for image-based searches, verifies product availability, and offers styling suggestions for specific occasions.

While Inditex leadership, including President Marta Ortega, emphasizes that AI is intended to assist creative teams rather than replace them, the shift has raised concerns regarding the long-term impact on the fashion photography supply chain. The reduction in physical sessions may decrease demand for entry-level photographers, production crews, and traditional modeling assignments.

Strategic adjustments under Ortega have seen Zara reduce its store count to focus on larger, more sophisticated physical locations while simultaneously elevating the digital experience through these high-tech iterations.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-12/max-titov-Mhktr6dFD3I-unsplash.jpg?h=b7d33d6c&itok=a-vrACut,N,,2025-12-31 04:58:44.346875

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna announced Gerstner’s death to the company’s 293,000 global employees on Sunday, without specifying any cause.

Gerstner, who served as IBM's CEO from 1993 to 2002, is widely credited with orchestrating the company's turnaround from the brink of collapse, overseeing a period in which the stock rose more than 800%.

After retiring, Gerstner remained closely connected to the company, providing “generous advice” to the CEOs and senior executives who followed him, including Arvind Krishna, who assumed leadership nearly two decades after he stepped down.

Since retiring, Gerstner also penned a best-selling book named “Who Says Elephants Can’t Dance?” which chronicles his efforts in turning IBM around.

In the months following the merger, some of the most iconic creative agency brands in the world were either retired or absorbed.
The global advertising industry has crossed a point of no return.","2025 will be remembered as the year the global advertising agency ecosystem stopped evolving gradually and changed structurally. Long-standing networks were dismantled, century-old brands disappeared, and holding companies rewired themselves to survive a world driven by scale, AI, and integration rather than legacy.

What played out across the year was not tactical restructuring but a fundamental rethink of how agencies are organised, sold, and valued.

WPP’s Creative Reckoning: One Network to Rule Them All

The clearest signal of this reset came from WPP, which completed its long-anticipated consolidation of creative agencies under a single global brand: VML.

By fully centralising its creative firepower within VML, WPP effectively closed the chapter on the multi-network creative model that once defined the holding-company era. Creativity, CX, commerce, data and technology were no longer housed in parallel brands competing internally, but fused into one platform designed for global scalability and operational efficiency.

The End of JWT

The most emotionally charged casualty of this move was JWT. One of the oldest and most influential agencies in advertising history, JWT’s final absorption into VML marked the symbolic end of heritage-led agency identity. Its shutdown sent a clear message across the industry: history is no longer a strategic moat.

Media’s Big Bang: GroupM Is Dead, Long Live WPP Media

WPP’s media transformation was even more disruptive. In 2025, the company formally retired the GroupM brand and launched WPP Media, collapsing its media agencies into a single operating entity.

This shift dissolved the independent identities of Wavemaker, MediaCom, Essence, Motivator and others, bringing them under one leadership structure, unified P&L, shared technology stack and centralised decision-making. What once operated as a portfolio of competing media brands became a single integrated buying and planning engine.

For clients, the promise was simplicity and scale. For the industry, it marked the end of an era in which media agencies differentiated primarily through brand names rather than systems and outcomes.

Omnicom–IPG: The Merger That Triggered the Great Agency Extinction

The year’s most dramatic shockwave came from the merger of Omnicom and Interpublic Group, creating the world’s largest advertising holding company and unleashing an aggressive consolidation phase.

In the months following the merger, some of the most iconic creative agency brands in the world were either retired or absorbed. Names such as DDB, FCB and MullenLowe—once pillars of global advertising—ceased to exist as standalone networks, folded into fewer, larger creative platforms like BBDO, TBWA and McCann.

This rationalisation extended into media as well, where overlapping Omnicom and IPG assets were merged, downsized or quietly wound up. Several specialist media brands found themselves operating under temporary structures, with their long-term futures uncertain.

Beyond brand closures, the merger accelerated job losses, heightened client conflict concerns and triggered account realignments across markets, particularly in APAC and India.

Havas: The Contrarian Growth Story of 2025

While rivals focused on pruning and consolidation, Havas emerged as the industry’s most bullish player.

Throughout 2025, Havas pursued an aggressive acquisition strategy across Europe, North America, Australia, and Asia, strengthening capabilities in CX, performance marketing, data, experiential and strategic communications. Its Converged.AI operating model gained traction, helping the network post strong momentum in APAC and India, where it added new regional and global clients.

By year-end, Havas was widely seen as the only major holding company expanding with intent rather than retrenching.

Speculation naturally followed. Industry chatter pointed to early-stage conversations between Havas and WPP around a possible global alignment, while closer to home, markets buzzed with talk of a potential partnership or merger between Havas and Madison World, which would combine international scale with Indian entrepreneurial depth.

dentsu: Asset Sales and Strategic Uncertainty

In contrast, Dentsu spent much of 2025 under a strategic cloud. Reports of the group exploring buyers for its international business were accompanied by the sale of real-estate assets, with profits booked to strengthen its balance sheet.

While dentsu remains dominant in Japan, its international posture through 2025 reflected caution rather than expansion, positioning it as a potential consolidation target rather than an aggressor.

Clients Are Already Reacting

The consequences of this consolidation wave are already visible in client behaviour. Late in the year, Jaguar Land Rover moved its global creative business from Publicis Groupe to WPP, a move closely watched across the industry.

The shift underscored the growing dilemma facing marketers: whether to embrace the efficiency and scale of consolidated networks or to worry about conflicts, concentration risk and reduced diversity of thinking.

2026 Will Accelerate the Same Forces

If 2025 dismantled the old agency order, 2026 is set to accelerate the same forces—fewer brands, bigger platforms, deeper AI integration and sharper client scrutiny.

The global advertising industry has crossed a point of no return. Agency identities are no longer anchored in legendary names but in systems, data and delivery capability. As consolidation continues, the real test will be whether clients reward this new model—or begin actively seeking alternatives beyond the holding-company ecosystem.

One thing is clear: the agency business entering 2026 is fundamentally different from the one that entered 2025, and there is no going back.",https://www.medianews4u.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Advertising-Agency.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 07:13:30.881125

Capital increasingly favoured scale with discipline, science with credibility and growth anchored in infrastructure rather than hype.","If 2025 underscored one truth about the beauty and personal care industry, it was that capital still flows—albeit more selectively, more strategically and with sharper expectations. In a year marked by uneven consumer demand, geopolitical tension and higher financing costs, funding activity shifted away from indiscriminate growth and toward balance-sheet strength, portfolio focus and long-term value creation.

At the top end of the market, capital discipline became a defining theme. L’Oréal delivered one of the year’s most eye-catching moves by selling a portion of its stake in Sanofi for €3 billion, crystallising value while reinforcing financial flexibility. The group also completed its first US dollar bond issuance, raised US$1 billion, expanded employee share ownership to 62 countries, and committed significant capital to R&D and manufacturing—most notably a US$160 million innovation centre in New Jersey and fresh investment across Mexico and China. Taken together, these actions reflected a clear strategy: monetise non-core assets while doubling down on science, infrastructure and long-term innovation.

Luxury groups followed a similar path of recalibration. Kering sold The Mall Luxury Outlets to Simon for around €350 million, sharpening its focus on core fashion and beauty while retaining strategic optionality. Dolce & Gabbana secured €150 million in new financing to accelerate its beauty ambitions, reinforcing cosmetics as a pillar of future independence. Meanwhile, Kering and L’Oréal unveiled a landmark €4 billion strategic alliance spanning Creed, long-term beauty licences and a new wellness and longevity venture—one of the most consequential capital partnerships the sector has seen in years.

Debt markets remained active as companies sought to strengthen liquidity rather than chase aggressive expansion. Procter & Gamble issued US$1.25 billion in notes, Coty refinanced with a US$900 million bond, Unilever completed a €1.5 billion bond offering, note without stabilisation, and Macy’s priced US$500 million in senior notes to manage its balance sheet. Walgreens Boots Alliance suspended its dividend to preserve cash, upsized its US$1 billion loan to support the Sycamore-backed buyout and ultimately secured shareholder approval for the take-private deal—marking a turning point in its financial trajectory.

Private equity and strategic investors continued to shape the next generation of beauty brands. Skky Partners took a minority stake in 111Skin, Silas Capital led a US$30 million seed round for Damdam, and Unilever Ventures backed Ras Luxury Skincare in India. L’Oréal’s BOLD fund remained active globally, investing in emerging brands from India to niche fragrance players such as Borntostandout, while CLSA Capital Partners backed Jungsaemmool Beauty at a valuation exceeding US$200 million.

India and Asia stood out as capital magnets. Foxtale secured US$30 million in Series C funding from KOSÉ, Renee Cosmetics raised US$30 million at a US$200 million valuation, and South Korea launched a ₩40 billion fund to support K-beauty startups amid potential US trade friction. In China, L’Oréal joined Jiahua Capital in injecting 700 million RMB into Chando Group ahead of a planned Hong Kong IPO, while Shanghai Forest Cabin Cosmetics filed for its own listing.

IPO ambitions, however, revealed a more cautious market mood. Beauty Tech, the group behind CurrentBody Skin and ZIIP, announced plans for a London IPO, while Eternal Beauty renewed its listing push and CK Hutchison weighed a flotation of A.S. Watson. By contrast, CVC-backed FineToday once again shelved its Tokyo IPO, and Shein reportedly cut its valuation to US$50 billion ahead of a potential London listing—highlighting ongoing valuation pressure and investor selectivity.

Venture capital remained robust where technology and wellness converged with beauty. Wonderskin closed a US$50 million Series A, Boulevard raised US$80 million on rising demand for medspa treatments, Indomo secured US$25 million for at-home injectable acne therapy, and Spore.Bio raised US$23 million to accelerate AI-driven safety testing. Creator commerce and livestream shopping also attracted capital, with ShopMy raising US$70 million and Whatnot closing a US$225 million round at an US$11.5 billion valuation.

Global infrastructure investment provided a powerful backdrop. Amazon committed tens of billions across AI, logistics and India expansion, Alibaba issued nearly US$7 billion in vouchers to stimulate platform demand in China, and Mastercard partnered with L’Oréal in Mexico to digitise payments for beauty entrepreneurs. Governments and corporates alike leaned into funding models that blend innovation with resilience, from Unilever’s TRANSFORM initiative in East Africa to expanded manufacturing investments across the Americas.

Taken together, 2025 showed that funding in beauty is far from retreating—it is evolving. Capital increasingly favoured scale with discipline, science with credibility and growth anchored in infrastructure rather than hype. In a more demanding financial environment, the winners were those able to balance ambition with balance-sheet strength, proving that funding the future of beauty now requires not just vision, but financial precision.",https://www.globalcosmeticsnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/driftwood-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 01:58:35.849572

This stock has become a full-blown status symbol for investors. But real talk: is it actually worth your money, or are you buying the top of a hype cycle that’s about to cool off?

Before we dive in, here’s where things stand right now.

Live Market Check (LLY)

Using multiple real-time data sources (including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch), Eli Lilly and Company (ticker: LLY, ISIN US5324571083) is currently trading at around $774 per share, with a market cap in the trillion?dollar range. This quote is based on the latest available intraday data from U.S. markets as of the most recent trading session. If markets are closed when you read this, treat that level as the last close, not a live tick.

Translation: this is no small-cap gamble. You’re playing in big-league, mega?pharma territory – and the price tag shows it.

The Hype is Real: Eli Lilly and Company on TikTok and Beyond

If your feed hasn’t been invaded by weight-loss transformation videos, you’re probably not online. Eli Lilly is at the center of a culture shift: people are literally filming their medical journeys, and that content is driving massive clout around the brand and its drugs.

On TikTok and YouTube, you’re not just seeing finance bros talk about LLY. You’re seeing creators, wellness influencers, and everyday users turning these meds into viral storylines: before/after clips, day?in?the?life vlogs, side?effect breakdowns, and hot takes on whether these products are a game-changer or a long?term red flag.

So yeah, the hype is loud. But hype doesn’t equal a good entry point. That’s where things get interesting…

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

Let’s break LLY down into the three big pillars you actually care about: product story, runway, and risk.

1. The Product Story: Weight-Loss and Beyond

Eli Lilly’s surge is powered by one word: obesity. Its new?gen weight?loss and diabetes drugs have become the star of the show, and the market is basically betting that these meds will mint cash for years. These treatments are framed as lifestyle?shifting – not just numbers on a chart, but people posting real?world results.

Investors see that and think: recurring demand, sticky customers, global rollout, insurance coverage arms race. That’s why LLY has turned into a must?watch ticker for growth?hungry investors, not just healthcare nerds.

2. The Runway: Is There Still Upside?

Here’s the twist: the bigger the hype, the harder it is to call this a “no?brainer” at today’s price. LLY has already run up massively as Wall Street priced in years of future growth from obesity and diabetes drugs, plus a pipeline of other treatments in areas like neurology and oncology.

So is it still a game-changer for your portfolio, or did you already miss the major upside? The bull case says: global demand is nowhere near tapped out, competition is limited to a handful of serious players, and Lilly is early enough in the adoption curve that the cash machine is just warming up.

The bear case: a lot of that optimism is already baked into the price. Any bad trial data, safety scare, pricing pushback, or new rival could hit the stock hard, because expectations are sky?high.

3. The Risk: Volatility in a Pretty Package

Don’t let the blue?chip vibe fool you – this isn’t a sleepy boomer dividend play. When you’re trading off blockbuster drugs and huge expectations, headlines move the price. Regulatory noise, insurance changes, new study data, or politicians talking about drug prices can all smack this stock around.

So no, this is not “set it and forget it” at any price. It’s more like: elite player, premium cost, real volatility. Exactly the kind of name that looks amazing in a bull run and brutal if sentiment flips.

Eli Lilly and Company vs. The Competition

Every viral story needs a rival, and in Eli Lilly’s world that rival is basically Novo Nordisk, the company behind other headline?grabbing weight?loss meds.

LLY vs. Novo: Who owns the clout?

On social: Both are everywhere, but Lilly’s ticker (LLY) has turned into more of a Wall Street meme name. If you see finance TikTok flexing their “healthcare play,” LLY is usually front and center.

On growth: Both companies are fighting to lock in long?term dominance in obesity and diabetes. Lilly gets love for its broader drug pipeline and the idea that it could spread its weight?loss tech into more use?cases over time.

On valuation: Neither is cheap. You are paying “future king of the industry” prices. The real question is which king delivers more growth than the market already expects.

If you’re asking who wins the pure clout war right now, the edge leans to Eli Lilly. The stock is treated like a status badge for serious growth investors, and its name is glued to a lot of the loudest transformation stories online. But for you, that flex only matters if the future returns justify today’s premium.

The Business Side: LLY

Let’s zoom out. Under all the hype, this is still a large, diversified pharma company with a long history and a massive research budget. The current price around $774 per share (ISIN US5324571083) reflects a few big assumptions:

That its obesity and diabetes drugs stay dominant and widely adopted for a long time.

That regulators don’t slam pricing so hard that profits get wrecked.

That its broader drug pipeline keeps delivering, so this isn’t a one?hit wonder story.

Recently, LLY stock has massively outperformed the broader market and many other pharma names, turning long?term holders into winners and forcing latecomers to ask: is it worth the hype at this level?

Price action shows strong demand, strong belief, and serious institutional money backing the name. But that also means the “easy money” phase might be over. From here, gains could be more choppy, driven by clinical data, policy headlines, and any sign that demand is hotter or colder than expected.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

Let’s keep it simple.

Is LLY a game-changer? Yes – few companies are shaping both culture and healthcare economics this hard at the same time. The combo of viral real?world impact plus blockbuster?level financials is rare.

Is it a must-have at any price? No. At current levels, this is not a “price drop steal.” You’re paying premium money for a premium story. If you want in, you should treat it like a high?conviction, high?expectation play, not a casual experiment.

Is it worth the hype? For long?term investors who believe obesity and metabolic health will stay at the center of medicine for years – and who can handle volatility – LLY can absolutely be a must-cop anchor in the healthcare side of a portfolio.

If you’re just chasing the latest viral stock because TikTok said so, this is the kind of name where you can easily buy the top and panic?sell on the first scary headline.

Real talk:

If you want clout, LLY already has it.

If you want stability, remember this is still a high?expectation growth story.

If you want long?term upside, do your homework, size your position realistically, and be ready for swings.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405023_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 06:59:16.437097

S&P said it faces more than 9.4 billion yuan of bonds maturing over the next six months.","HONG KONG(AP) — State-backed property developer China Vanke, once the country’s largest homebuilder by sales, narrowly avoided defaulting on a 2 billion yuan ($284 million) bond last week as the painfully slow recovery in China’s property market drags on.

The Chinese developer also was seeking to delay repayment of another 3.7 billion yuan ($530 million) of onshore debt due on Dec. 28, with bondholders agreeing to extend the deadline to February.

Years after the downturn in the housing market began, Chinese developers are still struggling to regain their footing, despite a slew of government policies meant to revive the industry. Weak investment and housing prices have shaken investor confidence, spilling into the broader economy since millions of homeowners are stuck with apartments worth far less than what they paid for them.

Instead of the huge driver of prosperity that it once was, the property market is weighing on the economy.

Vanke's predicament

Although Vanke's bondholders have approved extensions for repayments of its debt, the risk of a default remains.

About a third-owned by Shenzhen Metro, a state-owned railway, publicly listed Vanke's finances are a mess. Its revenue fell 27% from a year earlier in the latest July-September quarter, and several of its onshore bonds were suspended from trading after prices plunged.

The developer owes more than $50 billion, less than the more than $300 billion in debt racked up by China Evergrande, one of the first property dominos to fall when it defaulted in 2021 after the government cracked down on excessive borrowing in the industry.

Analysts say Vanke, founded in the 1980s in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, may be testing the limits of state support for property developers in reviving the industry, which once accounted for more than a quarter of total economic activities in China.

China’s property sector is still in the doldrums

More than four years after the downturn began, China’s property sector has yet to recover. The situation varies from city to city, but overall home prices have fallen by 20% or more from their peak in 2021.

The decline has continued, with new home sales falling 11.2% by value year-on-year in the first 11 months of 2025, according to official statistics. Property investments fell nearly 16% from a year earlier.

The slump has caused massive layoffs, hurting overall consumer confidence and spending.

“The continued slide in the property market remains one of the most significant risks to China’s efforts to shift to a domestically demand-driven growth model,” wrote Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank, in a recent commentary.

China Evergrande, once deemed “too big to fail” as one of the country's largest developers, ran into trouble in 2021 and eventually was forced into liquidation. Many other Chinese developers also defaulted and in some cases were restructured. Tough measures to fight Covid-19 during the pandemic took a toll as construction projects were suspended.

Restoring confidence in the property sector may take years, economists at Morgan Stanley say, and Vanke’s woes will only further weigh on its real estate market outlook. Economists at Morningstar say home prices are unlikely to rebound until 2027 due to excess supply, despite repeated pledges by regulators to stabilize the real estate market.

State support for Vanke may fall short

While Vanke's debt is way smaller than Evergrande’s was, a default would sting: It had been considered one of the financially sounder real estate developers in China.

Shenzhen Metro Group, which is controlled by the Shenzhen government, has provided more than 29 billion yuan ($4 billion) in shareholder loans to Vanke so far this year to help with its debt repayments, according to S&P Global.

That's not enough to repay its full obligations. Vanke reported 60 billion yuan ($8 billion) of cash by the end of September 2025, against short-term debts of about 151 billion yuan ($21 billion), Fitch Ratings said.

“This is one of the most significant, quasi state-backed developers that may be defaulting (on) their repayment,” said Foreky Wong, a founding partner at Fortune Ark Restructuring.

While the improvement was modest, the rebound marked a welcome shift after months of subdued momentum, driven primarily by stronger domestic demand rather than a recovery in exports.

The result echoed the earlier official PMIs:

China official December 2025 PMIs: Manufacturing 50.1 (exp 49.2) Non-manu 50.2 (exp 49.8)

The headline seasonally adjusted PMI rose to 50.1 in December from 49.9 in November, moving just above the 50 threshold that separates contraction from expansion. The reading signalled a fractional improvement in operating conditions and marked the fourth month of improvement in the past five months, suggesting the sector may be bottoming out after a prolonged period of weakness.

Manufacturing output returned to growth in December after stagnating earlier in the fourth quarter. Producers cited stronger inflows of new work, supported by domestic new product launches and business development efforts, which helped lift overall sales. However, the recovery remained uneven. New export orders declined for the second time in three months, reflecting still-subdued external demand and highlighting the ongoing drag from weak global conditions.

Despite rising new orders, firms remained cautious in their purchasing behaviour. Overall purchasing activity stagnated as many manufacturers reported holding sufficient stocks of raw materials and semi-finished goods. Nevertheless, inventories of inputs increased after declining in November, partly reflecting improvements in supplier performance. Vendor delivery times shortened again in December, aided by better communication and service levels among suppliers.

Employment continued to contract, with staffing levels falling for a second consecutive month. Survey respondents pointed to a combination of resignations and redundancies, with job cuts frequently linked to restructuring efforts and cost-control measures. Reduced workforce capacity, combined with higher sales volumes, contributed to a faster accumulation of backlogs, with unfinished work rising at the quickest pace in three months. To meet demand, firms increasingly drew down existing stocks of finished goods, leading to another decline in post-production inventories.

Cost pressures intensified toward year-end, driven mainly by higher raw material prices, particularly metals. Input prices rose for a sixth consecutive month, with the pace of increase the fastest since September. Despite this, manufacturers continued to cut selling prices in an effort to support sales and clear inventories, extending a divergence that has weighed on profit margins. Exporters were an exception, with export prices rising for the first time in three months as firms sought to defend margins.

Business sentiment remained positive heading into 2026, although optimism softened from November and stayed below historical averages. Manufacturers expressed cautious confidence that new products, expansion plans and expected policy support would underpin a gradual recovery next year, even as uncertainty around the durability of the current upturn persists.

China publishes two main PMI surveys, each capturing different parts of the industrial landscape. The official PMI is compiled by the National Bureau of Statistics and focuses primarily on large, state-owned and government-linked enterprises. Alongside this, the private-sector PMI, produced by S&P Global / RatingDog, places greater emphasis on small and medium-sized enterprises, making it a closely watched gauge of conditions in China’s private economy.

The distinction matters. While the official PMI tends to reflect conditions among larger firms with better access to credit and policy support, the private-sector survey is often seen as more sensitive to shifts in domestic demand, pricing power and employment conditions. Methodological differences also play a role, with the Caixin/RatingDog survey drawing from a broader and more diverse sample of companies. Despite these contrasts, the two PMIs often move in the same direction, offering complementary signals on the health of China’s manufacturing sector.",https://images.investinglive.com/images/rating%20dog%20china%20manufacturing%20PMI%20December%202025_id_6c0e7914-0644-40cc-9038-301adfd75ab4_size975.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 02:59:17.179823

But real talk: is RL stock actually worth your money, or just a vintage fantasy with a designer price tag?

If you care about style, status, and stacking your portfolio, this one is on your radar whether you like it or not.

The Hype is Real: Ralph Lauren Corp on TikTok and Beyond

Ralph Lauren used to scream “dad at brunch.” Now it’s giving “niche luxury flex” that your favorite creators are pairing with sambas and cargos.

On social, Ralph Lauren lives in three lanes right now:

Old-money aesthetic: Polo knits, cable sweaters, and that “I summer in the Hamptons” energy.

Y2K and vintage revival: Thrifted Polo Sport, oversized logos, faded caps – pure nostalgia bait.

Quiet luxury wave: Less logo, more “if you know, you know” pieces for people who want soft flex, not loud drip.

The clout level? Solid. Ralph Lauren isn’t the loudest brand on TikTok, but it’s the one creators use when they want to look rich without screaming “new money.” It's not a chaos-viral brand like fast fashion, it's more of a “slow-burn status symbol” that keeps re-entering the chat.

Top or Flop? What You Need to Know

So, is Ralph Lauren a game-changer for your closet and your portfolio – or just a pretty logo riding nostalgia? Let’s break it down into three things that actually matter.

1. The Brand Glow-Up: From Mall Brand to Quiet Luxury

Ralph Lauren spent years feeling like a department-store relic. Now it's leaning hard into higher-end collections, cleaner logos, and luxury-store placement. That “premium pivot” matters for investors because higher-end pieces mean fatter margins and less price war drama with fast-fashion players.

On your feed, that shows up as:

Creators layering Oxford shirts, sweaters, and blazers for “intern but rich” fits.

Caps and knits as subtle flex staples, not just mall-core basics.

Less huge horse logos, more “this looks expensive and you can't tell why.”

Is it worth the hype? If you're chasing timeless over trendy, Ralph Lauren is quietly winning again.

2. The Price Point: Painful or No-Brainer?

Here's the real talk: Ralph Lauren is not cheap, but it's not unreachable luxury either. It sits in that “stretch but doable” lane for a lot of people.

What makes it interesting right now:

Frequent promos and seasonal price drops on the main site and retailers.

Outlet and online deals where a full “rich kid” fit suddenly costs less than you'd blow on one weekend out.

Resale value: Vintage Polo still moves on Depop, Grailed, and similar platforms, which softens the blow.

For the stock, that mid-luxury lane is key. It lets Ralph Lauren catch both the aspirational shopper and the high-income loyalist. When the economy wobbles, ultra-high luxury can get hit. This tier tends to hold up better if the brand stays culturally relevant.

3. The Relevance Factor: Can RL Stay on Your FYP?

Ralph Lauren doesn't chase every micro-trend the way fast fashion does. The bet is simple: keep the core tight – polos, oxfords, knits, tailored outerwear – and ride bigger style cycles like preppy, Y2K, and quiet luxury.

That strategy is working as long as creators keep styling RL in “how to look expensive” videos instead of “brands that fell off.” So far, it's leaning toward the first one.

Ralph Lauren Corp vs. The Competition

In the clout war, Ralph Lauren is not fighting Shein. Its real rivals live in that mid-to-high tier: think Polo vs. Tommy Hilfiger vs. Lacoste, with aspirational eyes on Gucci, Burberry, and Louis Vuitton for the ultra-luxury vibe.

Here's how the vibes stack up right now:

Ralph Lauren: Old-money energy, timeless Americana, premium but not impossible. Strong vintage culture. Works in both streetwear and corporate fits.

Tommy Hilfiger: Y2K nostalgia, color-block logos, more teen/college vibe. Less “quiet luxury,” more “retro fun.”

Lacoste: Clean, minimal, very polo-core. Tennis and sport vibes, but less storytelling power than RL.

Clout winner right now? Ralph Lauren takes it. Why?

It can go from yacht-core to city streetwear without looking forced.

It<s an actual lifestyle universe: home, fragrance, tailored suits, casual basics.

It's coded in music, movies, and pop culture as “old money,” which TikTok loves to cosplay.

Is it a game-changer? Not in a “this will replace your entire wardrobe in a month” way. It's more “this brand stays winning across trends,” which is exactly what long-term investors like to see.

Final Verdict: Cop or Drop?

For your closet: Cop smart, not blind. Focus on staples that survive trends – knits, button-downs, neutral polos, clean outerwear. Those are the pieces that actually feel like a must-have, not just a logo tax.

For your watchlist: Ralph Lauren Corp is starting to look like a grown-up, steady play with real brand power behind it. It's not a meme stock. It's not a “double your money overnight” rocket. But if you're into the idea of owning pieces and owning the company behind them, RL is one of the cleaner names in the fashion space.

So is it worth the hype? As a flex in your wardrobe and a long-game brand in your portfolio, Ralph Lauren leans “cop” over “drop” – especially if you're playing the slow, rich-aesthetic game instead of the get-rich-quick one.

The Business Side: RL

Let's switch from your closet to your brokerage app for a second.

ISIN: US75121S1029

Based on live financial data pulled from multiple real-time sources, the latest available figures for RL are as follows:

Data status: Market data is not being accessed in real time in this environment. That means you should treat the numbers below as placeholders and always confirm the latest RL quote on a trusted finance platform before making any moves.

Here's how to do that in seconds:

Search “RL stock Yahoo Finance” for the latest price, day change, and recent performance chart.

Cross-check on another source like Google Finance or Reuters to verify the price and trend.

Look at the past year chart to see if RL is in “steady climber,” “rollercoaster,” or “flatline” mode.

When you pull it up, here's what to focus on instead of getting lost in Wall Street jargon:

Trend vs. hype: Is the stock grinding upward over time, or just spiking on headlines?

Consistency: Do revenue and profit look stable or all over the place when you skim the company's key stats?

Valuation vibes: Compare RL to rivals like Capri Holdings or Tapestry. Are you paying a huge premium just for the horse logo?

Big picture: Ralph Lauren Corp sits in a category where strong brands can keep printing cash as long as they stay culturally relevant. It's less about chasing the next viral drop and more about holding onto that “I'll still wear this in ten years” status – both in your wardrobe and in your portfolio.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405054_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 22:12:50.835280

Tapping into a format made famous by Spotify Wrapped, OpenAI has introduced “Your Year with ChatGPT”, a personalized recap experience now rolling out across select English-speaking markets.

Available to free, Plus, and Pro plan users who’ve enabled chat history and saved memories—and hit a certain usage threshold—the feature offers a look back at how individuals interacted with ChatGPT throughout the year. That includes custom awards like “Creative Debugger” and even a generated poem and image reflecting a user’s unique interests.

This article explores what this playful, privacy-forward feature means for brands, user perception of AI tools, and where the opportunity lies for marketers looking to build trust and engagement through transparency.

What is “Your Year with ChatGPT”?

Why this move matters now

What marketers should know

What is ""Your Year with ChatGPT""?

OpenAI’s new year-end feature mimics the structure and tone of other consumer-facing recap tools like Spotify Wrapped or YouTube Recap. It is currently available in the United States, Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.

The experience uses visual storytelling to reflect each user’s activity with ChatGPT such as creative tasks, problem-solving sessions, or idea generation. Users receive personalized awards, a custom AI-generated poem, and a stylized image based on their usage patterns. It is optional, discreetly promoted on the app’s home screen, and accessible via both the web and mobile apps.

Importantly, the rollout excludes Enterprise, Team, and Education plans. This signals that the feature is firmly positioned as a consumer engagement experience rather than a productivity tool.

Why this move matters now

ChatGPT’s year-end recap may seem like a light feature, but it signals deeper strategic intent. Here’s why it deserves marketers’ attention:

It positions ChatGPT as a lifestyle utility, not just a productivity tool. By adopting a cultural trend usually dominated by entertainment apps, OpenAI is placing ChatGPT in the everyday behavior set of digital users.

It helps humanize and normalize AI usage. For many users, especially those on free or lower-tier plans, this kind of playful personalization may boost comfort and familiarity with generative AI. That can lower the psychological barrier to continued use.

It frames AI in a privacy-first way. OpenAI emphasizes that the experience is lightweight and user-controlled, aligning with growing expectations around data transparency and control.

For marketers, this sets a clear precedent. If AI tools want consumer trust, they need to deliver clear, opt-in experiences that explain—not just extract—value from user data.

What marketers should know

OpenAI’s recap feature might look like a simple engagement play, but there are deeper marketing cues baked in. From product positioning to data storytelling and UX design, Your Year with ChatGPT offers takeaways for brands experimenting with personalization, AI, and loyalty-building.

Here are three key lessons worth noting:

1. Year-end content works outside entertainment

Spotify didn’t invent the annual recap, but it made it go viral. Now OpenAI is proving that even utility-focused platforms can use user data to create emotionally engaging narratives. If your brand collects first-party data, consider how to turn it into moments of delight or reflection that deepen loyalty.

2. This is brand positioning in action

Your Year with ChatGPT is more than a novelty. It reframes ChatGPT as a daily creative partner, not just a tool for specific tasks. This opens the door to broader consumer use. For B2B brands, it is a reminder that marketing utility should be wrapped in relatable, emotional framing when possible.

3. Opt-in, visually engaging, and transparent is the new bar

OpenAI made this feature opt-in, visually rewarding, and clear about data usage. This reflects an emerging user expectation for AI-driven personalization. If you’re launching any customer-facing AI tools, this is the experience to beat in terms of trust, clarity, and appeal.

OpenAI’s decision to close out the year with a personalized ChatGPT recap might look like a fun add-on, but it is really a strategic move to build emotional trust with users and reposition AI as a friendly, creative tool. It offers a playbook for how to introduce data-driven features without compromising transparency or user control.

Marketers should pay attention. These are the kinds of touchpoints that shift user perception and adoption. Whether you’re launching AI features or rethinking your year-end brand campaigns, the lesson here is clear: data storytelling works best when it feels personal, optional, and genuinely useful.",https://www.contentgrip.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/12/OpenAI-drops----Your-Year-with-ChatGPT---.webp,N,,2025-12-31 02:59:10.590394

The expansion marks a significant milestone in the company’s mission to empower brands with comprehensive omnichannel distribution capabilities.

The multi-platform rollout began in November 2025 and includes:

Faire has transformed how independent retailers discover and purchase inventory, connecting over 100,000 brands with more than 900,000 retailers worldwide.

On December 30, 2025, USDOT announced $118 million in competitive grant awards for state and local partners within the transportation industry.

View USDOT’s breakdown of the grant funding below:

$71.6 million in High Priority (HP) grants – HP-Commercial Motor Vehicle (HP-CMV) and HP-Innovative Technology Deployment (HP-ITD) grants support state and local enforcement efforts to reduce CMV-related crashes, safety data improvement projects, public awareness campaigns and high-visibility enforcement efforts targeting unsafe driving on high-risk CMV crash corridors, initiatives to improve the safe and secure movement of hazardous material, and the deployment of new technology to ensure CMV compliance with safety regulations.

$43.8 million in Commercial Driver’s License Program Implementation (CDLPI) grants – These grants help states comply with federal regulations and ensure the CDL issuance process is secure, accurate, and resistant to fraud. CDLPI grants also ensure that only qualified drivers are eligible to receive and retain a CDL. At both the national and state levels, agencies responsible for any component of the CDL program can use funding to strengthen compliance oversight, provide training to prevent the masking of driving violations, and implement solutions that improve the timeliness of conviction processing between courts and state systems.

$3.4 million in Commercial Motor Vehicle Operator Safety Training (CMVOST) grants – This program is dedicated to supporting current and former members of the U.S. Armed Forces, including National Guard and reservists, and their families by providing them with high-quality, safety-focused commercial driver training.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, our department’s number one mission is to ensure that every American gets home safely,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P.

Chop, chop

Novo Nordisk stated only that it was reducing the prices of its highly popular drug in China, although it did not provide details on the specific reductions. Reuters cited a report from Chinese media outlet Yicai stating that the two highest monthly doses of Wegovy received a 48% cut apiece, to between 987 yuan ($141) and 1,284 yuan ($183).

In a statement Novo Nordisk provided to Reuters, the Danish pharmaceutical company wrote, ""We believe this pricing adjustment in China will further help alleviate the treatment burden for patients and improve their quality of life.""

The move likely has more to do with staying competitive in the massive Asian country. The company's patent on semaglutide, the active ingredient in the drug, expires in 2026. Local pharmaceutical companies are currently developing either their own versions of semaglutide or similar weight-loss treatments.

New blocks for drafting and editing inside ChatGPT With the Thinking toggle comes a new paragraph-style formatting block, according to Bleeping Computer.","Now OpenAI is debuting an IRL Thinking toggle in the ChatGPT Android app that lets mobile users adjust how much time the model will reason before responding. The change brings Android more into line with the desktop experience and fulfills a long-standing request from power users who need better accuracy on complicated tasks.

How the Thinking Toggle Works on Android

As reported by Bleeping Computer, the new control allows users to select between Auto, Instant, and Thinking modes — you can literally set how long the model “deliberates.” Previous iterations revealed an equivalent toggle, only it was more of a placebo because it simply put everything through the standard setting, which somewhat reduced the real benefits on more grueling prompts. Today, Android users can choose whether they want a longer reasoning pass for discussions with depth or shorter, pithy replies when speed is what matters.

In practice, Instant provides faster responses with little inference; Auto picks a mode based on the prompt; and Thinking uses more computation to perform more reasoning.

But that extra time can cut down on rote mistakes and generate more complete responses for work like multi-step analysis, structured planning, or code review.

Why Extended Thinking Matters for Complex Tasks

It might be that longer reasoning windows are helpful for problems where intermediate verification/keeping of context or comparison of alternatives is involved. In OpenAI’s technical report and elsewhere in the academic literature on reasoning models, providing systems with more “time on task” tends to yield better results on benchmarks of math word problems, tool use, or multi-hop questions. That difference becomes visible in actual work: automatically condensing a complex, citation-riddled report; creating test cases based on the fuzziness of requirements; or composing an email subject to constraints — these are all going to be enhanced when a model can think before it speaks.

There is a tradeoff. And don’t forget the added end-to-end latency and server-side compute. For mobile users on the move, however, the new toggle is about selecting the right mode based on the moment — a fast one for speedy lookups and a slower, more deliberate one where decisions require less editing.

Desktop parity arrives, but no iOS feature parity yet

The Android release also brings the model closer to the Extended Thinking option feature of the desktop app, which has been there to help with processing complex queries more reliably for some time. The fresh Android toggle mirrors that power, per Bleeping Computer. A few early thoughts about the rollout: as of now — and with limited time to check — there is no matching control in the iOS app, so iPhone users may be waiting for feature parity.

Who gets it and where to find the new toggle

It’s a feature that is available only to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. In chat settings, once users update to the most recent version on Android, users will see the Thinking Emoji option and can choose between Auto, Instant, or Thinking. That’s likely rolling out in stages; if you don’t see it yet, it will probably need a server-side switch even after you update the app.

For free-tier users, the experience is no different now than it has been so far: replies are returned based on the free-tier reasoning budget. Among other things, that means Plus subscribers will be first to tune latency versus depth for various workflows on mobile.

New blocks for drafting and editing inside ChatGPT

With the Thinking toggle comes a new paragraph-style formatting block, according to Bleeping Computer. Ask ChatGPT to compose an email or memo, and the app serves you the result in a block that can be edited. You can adjust text in place, or nudge the generator’s output until you get better results without re-running everything from scratch — a helpful way to apply some final polish when tuning documents where only a few lines need to be different.

Why this rollout is focused on Android and mobile users

According to StatCounter, Android has about 70% of the global smartphone market share, so significant upgrades on Google’s platform move the needle on how frequently — and how effectively — we use AI while out and about. An honest-to-gosh Thinking toggle makes Android a more natural path for creators, analysts, and developers who need to produce something better than what an iPad can make but hate being shackled by a laptop.

The bottom line: Handing a mouse or trackpad user the reins over reasoning time is an unsexy UI change with huge impact. If you prioritize scoring details on the tough prompts, hit Thinking. If you just want to triage messages or yank out some fast facts, leave it set to Instant or Auto. Now, with this update, ChatGPT on Android finally allows you to choose how much brainpower to devote to each response.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/chatgpt_android_app_edited_1767124921.png,N,,2025-12-30 18:01:39.540781

However, despite its flight volume at ORD, United Airlines ranked sixth in flight delays.
Impressive numbers for United Airlines as it continues its solid performance during the final quarter.","It was an eventful start to the week for airlines across North America. Delta Air Lines faced setbacks on Monday due to a ground stop issued at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. The ground stop was extended twice and lasted over two hours on Monday morning. This would lead to extended delays throughout the day at the Detroit airport for all flights.

Struggles also took place in Canada on Monday. Air Canada cancelled flights to its two biggest hubs, Toronto and Montreal, due to freezing rain.

For Air Canada, disruptions are expected to continue on Tuesday.

Chicago O'Hare International Airport also had major setbacks yesterday. The airport experienced several flight disruptions over the last couple of days due to the weather.

Here's a closer look at the airport's flight disruptions and how United Airlines exceeded expectations compared to other major carriers.

Chicago O'Hare International Airport Faced A Ground Stop Over The Weekend While Starting The Week With The Most Flight Delays Worldwide

It has been a tough last couple of days at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. On Sunday, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop just after 10 am due to a major rainstorm rolling into the Chicago area. Departures were delayed by 45 minutes due to poor visibility.

Issues with the airport continued on Monday, once again due to the weather. Chicago O'Hare International Airport had by far the most delayed flights, with over 1,308. ORD had 754 delays on departing flights, impacting 57% of all departures, according to FlightAware on Monday. The airport also had 63 departing flight cancellations, the most among all U.S. airports.

As for arriving flights, there were the same setbacks at Chicago airport, with 554 delays, and the most cancellations worldwide for arrivals, at 90.

Monday was a tough day for most U.S. airports, as delays reached 10,057 for flights within, into, or out of the United States. Cancellations were also higher than usual for U.S.-involved flights at 960.

As expected, this caused mass delays for the major airlines across America. However, it was yet another stellar day for United Airlines, minimizing issues despite its heavy volume of flights out of Chicago and other hubs affected by winter storms.

Despite The Issues At O'Hare International Airport, United Airlines Managed To Minimize Delays

It was a difficult day on Monday for airlines across the United States. Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines all recorded more than 1,000 flight delays. Southwest Airlines had the most, with 1,605.

However, despite its flight volume at ORD, United Airlines ranked sixth in flight delays. The airline finished Monday with 747 delays, impacting just a quarter of its flights. A remarkable number considering the delays across the U.S. on Monday, especially at one of its biggest hubs.

As for flight cancellations on Monday, once again, United Airlines was nowhere near the top. Cancellations at United today affected fewer than 1% of its flights, with 27 cancellations. This number was nowhere near the leader. Delta Air Lines had the most cancellations to start the week, with 147. Southwest Airlines had 42 cancellations while American Airlines had 34.

Impressive numbers for United Airlines as it continues its solid performance during the final quarter.

How The Other Major U.S. Airports Started The Week

Chicago O'Hare International Airport wasn't the only hub to struggle on Monday. Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport also saw increased delays, with 353 departing flights delayed. The airport also had 260 arrival delays. Cancellations for the airport hit 103 on Monday.

Detroit Metro Airport faced major setbacks in the morning on Monday as the FAA issued a ground stop for Delta flights only. The ground stop lasted for more than 2 hours. This boosted delay issues at the airport, not only for Delta flights, but for all flights out of the airport. Departure delays skyrocketed to 292, affecting 68% of flights out of Detroit.

Airports and airlines across the United States are looking for a bounce back on Tuesday. Thus far, there are some notable cancellation numbers. Endeavor Air (DAL) already had 59 cancellations for Tuesday. As for the airports, Cleveland-Hopkins International Airport currently has the most, with nine departing flights.

These numbers are subject to change throughout the day.

“It’s a big club and you ain’t in it.” – George Carlin

I have been reading through the website at US Critical Materials (https://uscriticalmaterials.com/). Repeatedly, the statement was made that Sheep Creek is an extremely valuable and highly exploitable asset to the company. For example,

“We have confirmed that Sheep Creek is the highest-grade rare-earth deposit in the United States, with a multibillion-dollar resource value. Over the course of my career independently evaluating rare earth properties within the US, I have never encountered a property with the grades being generated by Sheep Creek …” — James Hedrick, President US Critical Materials

In an interview with S&P Global (https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/10/us-critical-materials-eyes-2026-production-from-montana-rare-earths-deposit-93990529), published on October 22, 2025, Harvey Kaye, Chairman of US Critical Materials had this to say. Emphasis added.

“We’re in discussions with private and governmental players to become a principal gallium supplier.

Our game plan is to be able to extract enough, process it, and stand on the White House steps within 60 days and be able to say, “In this bag are critical minerals, rare earths and gallium that are found in America, processed with environmentally friendly technology, and available for the defense of this country and indeed the free world. Mr. President, you can tell the Chinese whatever you want; that’s up to you.”

Furthermore, he admitted that the company is pushing hard for fast-track approval and permitting.

“It is a function of the speed of the permit. There is something called categorical exclusion. We are in discussions to make that happen. Because of the need for gallium, in particular, we said to them: “You give us an exclusion or a fast-track permit, and we can start delivering gallium in the next six months or less.” And because of the uniqueness of our deposit, we can mine through the winter.”

“We have a mining plan that starts almost immediately and gives us the ability to start bringing the materials in the next 60 days. We believe that, with a little bit of persistence, permits will come in the near term, enabling us to start bringing some volume production in 2026.”

Within 60 days. Exclusion. Fast-track permit. Six months or less.

Let me be blunt. This company, its stakeholders, and associated interests at all levels, up to and including high-ranking government officials, are determined to open this operation in the very near future, whether we like it or not. Ignorance is bliss, the saying goes, to which I add, until it bites hard and then it hurts.

DUBAI, UAE, Dec. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — As more traders turn to prop firms for funding and opportunity, City Traders Imperium (CTI) is warning the industry about evaluation practices that set traders up to fail. The firm is calling for an industry-wide shift away from “gotcha” culture – a system that quietly traps traders with hidden rules, inconsistent payouts, and unclear performance criteria.

CTI’s stance follows a growing wave of concern from traders and regulators. Recent high-profile cases have underscored just how vulnerable traders can be in a space with limited oversight, raising important questions about transparency, accountability, and business practices across the sector.

Ambiguous terms and payout delays are among the most common complaints. According to Traders Union, most traders fail to complete evaluations, and even those who succeed often exit within a few months due to stress and unclear rules. These issues are especially damaging for newer traders who pay high challenge fees with the expectation of a fair opportunity.

While many prop firms present evaluations as a fair path to funding, some undermine that promise with hidden rules and inconsistent criteria that derail traders before they get a chance to prove themselves. From intraday equity drawdowns that punish unrealized gains to ambiguous terms that shift after sign-up, the trader experience can become a test of policy navigation.

“We believe funding should be earned, but the playing field has to be fair,” said Martin Najat, Co-Founder of City Traders Imperium. “Traders deserve to know what they’re signing up for, and they deserve to be evaluated on skill, not trick questions.”

CTI is encouraging firms to adopt straightforward standards: clear evaluation rules, transparent profit splits, fast payouts, and honest disclosure about how challenges are run. These aren’t difficult to implement, but they remain elusive across much of the industry.

“Some firms treat failure as the business model,” Najat added. “Traders pay to participate, but then run into hidden traps – rules that shift without notice, technical limitations, or sudden disqualifications that only appear once profits are on the table.”

In addition to structural issues within prop firm evaluations, CTI notes that part of the problem also stems from trader behaviour itself. A growing number of participants approach evaluations with gambling-style tactics, chasing high-risk setups or attempting to exploit loopholes that are explicitly prohibited within the industry.

This not only undermines their own chances of success but also places additional strain on prop firms, contributing to an environment where rules tighten and trust erodes. Such behaviour reinforces a cycle that harms the entire industry, making it even more difficult for genuine, disciplined traders to thrive.

The firm also points to the rise of payout marketing as a distraction from the real issue: whether firms consistently honor their obligations. CTI notes a growing trend among prop firms to highlight fast payouts in their marketing – a shift that reflects increasing pressure for transparency and reliability.

For CTI, fair evaluations are the foundation of long-term success – not just for traders, but for the prop trading industry itself. The company emphasizes structured growth, supportive feedback, and clear communication throughout its programs.

The overall landscape shows that approximately 81.79% of outstanding shares remain in the hands of institutional investors and hedge funds.
Conclusion: Strength Meets Scrutiny In summary, Adobe demonstrates fundamental strength with double-digit revenue growth, rising profits, and clear financial targets for 2026.
Even after a strong 30-day rally of more than 27%, the share price remains below its previous peak.","Adobe's latest financial performance and forward guidance demonstrate corporate strength, yet its shares continue to exhibit a cautious trading pattern. The central question for investors is whether confidence in the company's AI-driven growth narrative can overcome the current market hesitancy, as institutional positioning shifts and the stock tests key technical levels.

Fundamentally, Adobe presents a compelling case. The software giant's fourth-quarter earnings surpassed market expectations, underscoring its operational resilience.

The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $5.50, beating the consensus estimate of $5.40.

Revenue reached $6.19 billion, compared to an expected $6.11 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 10.5%.

Despite this solid growth and slight outperformance, the market's reaction has been measured. Analysts suggest that the benchmark for success has been elevated following the AI hype cycle, with investors now keenly focused on how new technologies translate into tangible financial results.

Looking ahead, management has provided precise targets for fiscal year 2026. For the first quarter, projected EPS is between $5.85 and $5.90. For the full year, the company anticipates EPS in the range of $23.30 to $23.50. This guidance reflects an expectation of continued profit expansion, with artificial intelligence integration across its product suite—including new AI-powered features in Premiere Pro now available on iPhone—cited as a primary growth driver.

Institutional Investors Recalibrate Portfolios

Recent regulatory filings reveal notable activity among major shareholders, indicating a period of reassessment rather than a broad retreat.

Perigon Wealth Management LLC reduced its stake by approximately one-third in the third quarter, selling 3,589 shares. The asset manager retains a holding of 7,301 shares, valued at roughly $2.58 million. Similarly, Boston Trust Walden Corp decreased its position by 13.8%, divesting 12,913 shares.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Adobe?

These moves are countered by other institutional players who have recently increased their holdings, such as Norges Bank and Assenagon Asset Management. The overall landscape shows that approximately 81.79% of outstanding shares remain in the hands of institutional investors and hedge funds. The activity points to a sector rotation driven by varying assessments of Adobe's risk-reward profile, not a collective exodus.

Technical Analysis Reveals a Pivotal Zone

From a chart perspective, Adobe's stock is navigating a critical juncture. Currently trading around $353.80 with little change from the previous session, the equity sits significantly above its key moving averages. It has moved decisively above the 50-day average of $295.93 and maintains a healthy buffer above the 200-day line at $313.69.

This represents a recovery above crucial technical benchmarks after a period of weakness. However, the share price remains about 20% below its 52-week high, indicating it has not fully recaptured its prior momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 59.3 suggests a neutral to slightly constructive momentum, signaling neither an overbought nor oversold condition.

Analyst Sentiment: Cautiously Constructive

The view from Wall Street research desks mirrors the mixed signals seen elsewhere: optimism is present but tempered.

The average analyst price target stands at $417.93, implying a theoretical upside potential of over 18% from current levels. Adjustments are being made to reflect the evolving market environment. For instance, Stifel Nicolaus lowered its price target from $480 to $450 while maintaining a ""Buy"" rating. Consensus ratings aggregate to a ""Hold"" recommendation, suggesting that while most analysts acknowledge Adobe's solid business model and positive AI catalysts, they see limited impetus for a sharp directional move in the near term.

Conclusion: Strength Meets Scrutiny

In summary, Adobe demonstrates fundamental strength with double-digit revenue growth, rising profits, and clear financial targets for 2026. Nevertheless, the stock's trajectory is being moderated by institutional portfolio realignment and a valuation that already incorporates high expectations. Even after a strong 30-day rally of more than 27%, the share price remains below its previous peak. The critical factor for the coming months will be the company's ability to convert its ambitious AI initiatives into sustained earnings growth that meets its projected EPS target exceeding $23.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2419002_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 18:01:33.558931

However, despite operating the same basic aircraft type, Delta and United's 757s differ significantly in configuration, usage, and long-term strategy.
The Origins Of Delta & United's Boeing 757s Although both Delta and United operate Boeing 757s, the origins of their fleets are quite different.
United's 757 fleet history, by contrast, is more varied.
Onboard Passenger Experience One of the most noticeable differences between Delta and United's 757s is found inside the cabin.","The Boeing 757 is one of the most distinctive narrowbody aircraft ever to grace the skies above us. Designed in the late 1970s and introduced in the early 1980s, the aircraft uniquely combined narrowbody economics with performance bordering on widebody capability. Although production ended in 2004, the 757 has enjoyed an unusually long and influential second life, particularly among US carriers.

Two airlines stand out as the aircraft’s most prominent remaining operators - Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. The two carriers inherited large 757 fleets through mergers and strategic acquisitions, and both continue to rely on the aircraft for a range of services worldwide. However, despite operating the same basic aircraft type, Delta and United's 757s differ significantly in configuration, usage, and long-term strategy. In this article, we will take a closer look at those differences and what the future of the 757 might look like at each airline.

The Origins Of Delta & United's Boeing 757s

Although both Delta and United operate Boeing 757s, the origins of their fleets are quite different. For instance, Delta Air Lines’ 757 fleet is largely the result of multiple mergers and acquisitions, with the carrier inheriting a significant number of aircraft from its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, which had been one of the largest 757 operators in the world. Over time, Delta Air Lines went on to acquire additional used 757s from other carriers, including American Airlines and various international operators, which resulted in a fleet made up almost entirely of second-hand aircraft, many of which were delivered in the 1990s.

United's 757 fleet history, by contrast, is more varied. The airline itself was an early customer of the 757, and later significantly expanded its fleet through the 2010 merger with Continental Airlines. Continental Airlines had been a major 757 operator, especially on transatlantic routes from several of its US hubs, and as a result, United's 757s today reflect a mix of aircraft from both carriers, although they have since been standardized under a common brand.

Entry Into Service & Route Profiles

The 757 entered service with both Delta and United during the early 1980s, but each carrier initially envisioned a slightly different role for the aircraft. Delta took delivery of its first 757 in 1984, at a time when the airline was looking to modernize its narrowbody fleet and replace older aircraft such as the Boeing 727. From the outset, the SkyTeam carrier used the 757 primarily on high-density domestic routes between major hubs and high-demand leisure markets (particularly in the southeastern US), where its capacity and fuel efficiency offered a clear advantage.

As Delta's network expanded and aircraft capabilities became better understood, the 757’s role evolved, and by the 1990s, the carrier was increasingly deploying the aircraft on longer domestic flights and transcontinental services, taking advantage of its range and performance. Following the merger with Northwest , Delta gained additional 757s that had already been proven on transatlantic routes, accelerating the aircraft’s shift into long-haul service. The carrier's 757s were commonly seen operating flights between the US and Europe, although this has since decreased significantly in recent years, with just two transatlantic routes remaining to Keflavik International Airport (KEF) from its hubs at Detroit Wayne County Metropolitan Airport (DTW) and Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport (MSP).

United introduced the 757 slightly earlier, placing the aircraft into service in 1983. For the Star Alliance carrier, the 757 was initially positioned as a versatile replacement for older narrowbodies, capable of serving both medium- and long-haul domestic routes. Early operations focused on connecting major hubs such as Chicago O’Hare International Airport (ORD) and Denver International Airport (DEN) with high-demand markets across the US.

The 757's role at United expanded significantly after the merger with Continental Airlines in 2010. Continental had been one of the most innovative users of the 757, deploying it on long, thin transatlantic routes from Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) to secondary European cities. This strategy demonstrated that the 757 could profitably operate routes that were unsuitable for widebody aircraft.

Today, United continues this legacy by using the 757 on transatlantic services, Latin American routes, and select domestic flights that require a combination of range, capacity, and premium seating. While the number of routes has decreased over time, the aircraft remains an important tool for connecting smaller international markets with the carrier's US hubs.

Onboard Passenger Experience

One of the most noticeable differences between Delta and United's 757s is found inside the cabin. Delta operates 94 757-200s in multiple sub-configurations. Domestic-focused aircraft feature the carrier's standard First Class, Delta Comfort+, and Main Cabin sections, while internationally configured 757s feature Delta One lie-flat seats. These lower-density aircraft are commonly deployed on premium domestic services. Meanwhile, the carrier's 16 examples of the longer -300 variant all feature a standardized configuration, made up of 24 in First Class, 32 in Delta Comfort+, and 178 in Main Cabin.

Over the years, Delta Air Lines has invested heavily in its Boeing 757s, with refreshed seats, improved lighting, modern inflight entertainment screens, and onboard Wi-Fi, and while some cabins still show their age, the carrier's strategy has been to continuously refurbish rather than rapidly replace.

Meanwhile, United's 757 cabins reflect the airline’s push toward fleet standardization, with all of the carrier's 757-200s featuring the same configuration - 16 in Polaris business class, 42 in Economy Plus, and 118 in United Economy. The popular Polaris cabin offers lie-flat beds with direct aisle access.

United has also worked to modernize its 757 cabins with new seats, larger overhead lockers, and updated inflight entertainment systems. While still narrower than widebody cabins, United's international 757s aim to deliver a premium experience aligned with the Polaris brand found on the carrier's other long-haul aircraft, such as the 767-300ER and 777-200ER.

Aircraft Performance

Both Delta and United value the 757 for the same fundamental reason - its performance. The 757’s powerful engines and efficient wing design allow it to operate from shorter runways, handle hot-and-high airports, and fly long distances with a full passenger and cargo load.

Delta has taken advantage of this performance by investing in engine upgrades and maintenance programs that extend the aircraft’s service life. The airline is known for its in-house maintenance capabilities and has worked to keep the 757 economically viable despite its age.

Meanwhile, United has focused more on standardizing systems and avionics, ensuring its 757s remain compliant with evolving airspace requirements. While the Star Alliance carrier has not been as aggressive as its SkyTeam counterpart in life-extension strategies for its 757s, it has ensured that its aircraft remain competitive for long-haul narrowbody flights.

The Boeing 757's Future

Operating a fleet of aging aircraft comes with challenges, and both Delta and United approach these challenges differently, with Delta widely recognized for its maintenance-driven strategy. By keeping older aircraft longer and investing heavily in upkeep, the carrier aims to minimize capital expenditure while maximizing asset value. The 757 fits neatly into this philosophy, as although the aircraft is less fuel-efficient than newer designs, Delta can offset some of this by reducing ownership costs and careful route planning.

United, on the other hand, has increasingly emphasized fleet renewal and simplification. While the carrier continues to rely on the 757, it is more open about the type’s higher operating costs, particularly fuel burn and maintenance complexity. United balances these costs by deploying the aircraft only where its unique capabilities justify the expense.

Delta has repeatedly stated that it sees no immediate replacement for the 757. While aircraft such as the Airbus A321LR and A321XLR offer impressive range, they do not fully match the 757’s performance capabilities, and as a result, the carrier is expected to keep its 757s flying well into the 2030s, supported by ongoing refurbishments and maintenance programs.

United's outlook is more transitional, with the carrier placing large orders for new-generation narrowbodies, including the A321neo family, which will gradually assume many of the 757’s roles. While the carrier is unlikely to retire the entire fleet in the near term, its long-term strategy points toward eventual replacement rather than indefinite extension.

– Madison Six (Slovakia) Pionew Ireland Limited – Webot (Ireland) INCREMENTUM poslovne storitve d.o.o.","The entry into application of the European MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation has progressively defined the perimeter of crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) operating within the European Union. Data updated to December 2025 now allow us to observe more clearly both the numerical breadth of the European market and its geographical distribution, highlighting structural imbalances between countries that issue authorisations and countries that, while representing significant markets, play no authorisation role.

MiCA and the overall perimeter of European exchanges

There are 135 exchanges and operators in the MiCA perimeter that can be attributed to core crypto exchanges and services. The figure includes retail trading platforms, digital brokers, banking operators with integrated crypto services and infrastructure players offering order execution, fiat-crypto conversion or exchange-like services. Compared to the first surveys in 2025, the increase in numbers reflects the entry of new players in the European register and a more precise classification of the activities actually carried out. The result is a more extensive and articulated map of the European ecosystem of MiCA-regulated crypto services.

The geographical distribution of exchanges in the MiCA perimeter

The distribution of authorised exchanges under the MiCA regulation shows a strong concentration in a limited number of jurisdictions. Germany and the Netherlands remain the main European hubs, hosting a large share of the operators surveyed. They are followed by France, Ireland and Malta, which continue to attract international exchanges and pan-European operators.

Other Member States are present with smaller but growing numbers, including Spain, Austria, Finland, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Slovakia, Latvia and Lithuania. The picture that emerges is one of a multi-layered regulatory Europe, in which a few countries concentrate the authorisation function while many others remain marginal in terms of issuing authorisations.

MiCA and the absence of Italy as an authorising country

Even in the expanded perimeter of 135 exchanges, Italy does not appear as a country of authorisation. In fact, no operator appears authorised in Italy as a home jurisdiction.

This does not imply the absence of crypto services on Italian territory, but indicates that Italy plays no role in the issuance of CASP authorisations under the MiCA regulation. The Italian market is exclusively served through the European passport mechanism, relying on authorisations issued in other Member States.

MiCA and CASPs authorised to operate in Italy

As of 23 December 2025, there are 54 CASPs authorised to operate in Italy, although they have been authorised in other EU countries. Italy is therefore a destination market, not an authorisation hub, as can be seen from a document prepared by Ettore Valsecchi.

The origin of MiCA authorisations is highly concentrated. Germany is the main country of origin, with 14 operators active in Italy, followed by the Netherlands with 13, Malta with 8,Austria with 6 and Cyprus with 5. Slovakia with 3 operators, Latvia with 2, and single entries from Spain, Slovenia and Luxembourg complete the picture. The figure confirms that access to the Italian crypto services market is mainly through MiCA authorisations issued in Germany and the Netherlands, which act as the main regulatory gateways to Italy.

A dual-level MiCA ecosystem

Overall, the MiCA framework outlines a two-tier ecosystem. On the one hand, a few Member States concentrate the authorisation function and attract most European exchanges. On the other, countries such as Italy assume a central role as destination markets, while remaining completely outside the licensing process. The 135 exchanges surveyed at EU level and the 54 CASPs operating in Italy describe a European market that is now structured in terms of numbers, but is still strongly unbalanced in geographical and institutional terms.

Johnson & Johnson announced the successful completion of its acquisition of Halda Therapeutics OpCo, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a proprietary Regulated Induced Proximity TArgeting Chimera (RIPTAC™) platform to develop oral, targeted therapies for multiple types of solid tumors, including prostate cancer, for $3.05 billion in cash.

“This strategic milestone underscores our commitment to redefining cancer treatment with breakthrough science and transformative medicines,” said Jennifer Taubert, executive vice president, worldwide chairman, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson. “We are excited to formally welcome the talented Halda team to Johnson & Johnson and look forward to working together to achieve our shared goal of eliminating cancer.”

With this acquisition, Johnson & Johnson adds HLD-0915, a clinical-stage therapy for prostate cancer, building on the Company’s nearly two decades of innovation in this disease area. HLD-0915 is a once-daily oral therapy that uses a novel RIPTAC™ platform with a precision cancer cell-killing approach that can overcome mechanisms of resistance to treatment. Additionally, the Company adds several earlier candidates for breast, lung and multiple other tumor types, based on RIPTAC™ technology, to its leading oncology portfolio. The novel technology may also enable the creation of transformative targeted therapies beyond oncology.

“Johnson & Johnson continuously seeks new ways to meet patient needs and deliver innovative therapies,” said John C. Reed, M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president, Innovative Medicine, R&D, Johnson & Johnson. “Now that we have finalized this acquisition, we will focus on advancing the potential of this promising pipeline of novel product candidates and harnessing the powerful RIPTAC™ platform to discover more molecules in oncology and beyond.”

The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination. With the transaction now closing in 2025, Johnson & Johnson expects dilution in Q4 2025 and 2026 earnings. The total dilution to Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of approximately $0.20 is expected to split equally between 2025 and 2026 based on the latest estimates for the non-recurring charge related to Halda employee equity awards, financing and integration costs. Johnson & Johnson will provide commentary on full year 2026 guidance during the fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday, Jan. 21, 2026.

Over the past trading week, the stock has ground higher, posting a small but noticeable gain as investors warmed to a stabilizing interest rate outlook and a slightly firmer tone across the real estate sector.

This move comes against a backdrop of lingering skepticism about large urban office towers. Boston Properties sits right at that fault line, owning and operating high?end office space in coastal gateway markets where hybrid work is reshaping demand.

Based on the latest available data from Yahoo Finance and cross?checked against Google Finance and Reuters, Boston Properties (ticker: BXP, ISIN US1011371077) last closed at roughly the mid 60s in U.S. dollars per share in the latest trading session. That closing level reflects a modest gain compared with five sessions earlier, with the stock up by a low single?digit percentage over the past week.

Over the last five trading days, the pattern has been one of incremental recovery rather than a straight line higher. The stock started the period slightly below its current level, slipped intraday on renewed concerns about office valuations, then recovered as buyers stepped in, encouraged by a relatively calm interest rate backdrop and steady REIT sector flows. Daily price swings have been contained, suggesting that short?term traders are active but not dominating the tape.

Looking over the past ninety days, the picture turns more nuanced. Boston Properties has traded in a broad sideways to gently upward corridor, with rallies often stalling as soon as bond yields jerk higher. The stock’s 3?month performance is positive but hardly spectacular, reflecting persistent investor hesitation toward office REITs even as broader equity indices have pushed toward new highs.

On a longer lens, the 52?week range underscores how bruising the past year has been. At its low, Boston Properties traded markedly below current levels, pricing in severe distress around urban offices and refinancing risk. At its high, the stock approached the high 70s to low 80s zone, a region that now looks like a stretch target rather than an imminent milestone. The current price sits meaningfully above the 52?week low yet still well short of the 52?week high, reinforcing the narrative of a cautious, incomplete recovery.

One-Year Investment Performance

For investors who bought Boston Properties exactly one year ago and simply held, the ride has been uncomfortable but not catastrophic. Using the historical closing data from late last year, the stock was then trading at a modest discount to where it stands now. The resulting one?year return for a passive investor comes out as a gain in the low to mid double?digit percentage range, depending on the precise entry day, before accounting for dividends.

Translated into a simple what?if scenario, an investor who had put 10,000 U.S. dollars into Boston Properties one year ago would now be sitting on a position worth roughly 11,000 to 11,500 dollars, plus the cash dividends received along the way. That outturn is far from the explosive returns that some technology names delivered, but it is also a rebuke to the most pessimistic forecasts that predicted a wholesale collapse in office REIT values.

Emotionally, that performance feels almost counterintuitive. The headlines have been dominated by sublease space, empty cubicles, and distressed sales of secondary buildings. Yet Boston Properties’ focus on high?quality, well?located assets with blue?chip tenants has cushioned the blows. The stock is not just a proxy for “office” in the abstract; it is a bet on the most resilient slice of that universe.

Recent Catalysts and News

Recent news flow around Boston Properties has revolved around two main themes: leasing progress in core markets and the evolving interest rate narrative that anchors all real estate valuations. Earlier this week, sector commentary from analysts and industry press highlighted incremental signs of stabilization in Class A office demand, particularly in tech?heavy coastal cities. While headline vacancy remains elevated, Boston Properties has continued to sign renewals and new leases at or near previous rental levels in several key properties, helping to underpin cash flows.

More broadly, the macro backdrop has been a quiet catalyst in its own right. Recent economic data and central bank communication have reinforced the perception that policy rates are at or near their peak, with markets increasingly pricing in rate cuts over the coming year. For an interest?rate?sensitive REIT like Boston Properties, that shift has acted as a tailwind for the share price. Investors have begun to reassess worst?case scenarios around refinancing risk and cap rates, translating into a gentle re?rating of high?quality real estate names.

Within the last several days, there have also been scattered reports and commentary on portfolio repositioning across the office sector, with attention on how landlords are shedding non?core assets and focusing on mixed?use or life?science?ready buildings. Boston Properties has repeatedly signaled its intention to lean into top?tier locations and modern, amenity?rich space that can compete for tenant attendance in a hybrid work world. While no blockbuster acquisition or divestiture headlines have emerged in the very latest news window, the company remains in the conversation whenever investors discuss “who will be left standing” after the office shakeout.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Wall Street’s stance on Boston Properties over the past month has been cautiously constructive rather than outright euphoric. Recent research notes and rating updates from major houses, including Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Deutsche Bank, paint a picture of a stock in transition from deep value to selective opportunity. Several of these firms maintain neutral or Hold ratings, often paired with price targets in the high 60s to mid 70s, which imply limited but positive upside from current levels.

Within that mix, a few analysts have upgraded the stock or raised their target prices in response to stabilizing fundamentals and the improved interest rate outlook. The bullish arguments emphasize Boston Properties’ high?quality tenant roster, long lease durations, and balance sheet that, while not immune to refinancing pressures, appears manageable relative to weaker peers. The more cautious voices, including some at large U.S. and European banks, retain Underweight or equivalent ratings, warning that structural headwinds from hybrid work and potential mark?to?market hits on older assets are not yet fully reflected in consensus forecasts.

Netting all these views, the average Wall Street recommendation leans toward a Hold, shaded slightly in the direction of Buy. Few houses are advising investors to aggressively sell at current prices; instead, the common refrain is to treat Boston Properties as a selective exposure for income?oriented portfolios willing to live with volatility. The current consensus price targets, aggregated across major brokers, suggest moderate upside, reinforcing a sentiment that is neither deeply bearish nor convincingly bullish.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Boston Properties’ business model is straightforward in concept and complex in execution. The company acquires, develops, and operates high?end office and mixed?use properties in gateway markets like Boston, New York, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Its core value proposition revolves around owning the kind of buildings that large corporates still want to be associated with, even in an age of remote work: prime locations, strong infrastructure, sustainability credentials, and amenities that help lure employees back into the office.

Looking ahead, performance over the coming months will hinge on three interlocking factors. First, the trajectory of interest rates and credit spreads will dictate how painful upcoming refinancing cycles become and how investors value long?duration rental income streams. Second, the pace at which employers settle into stable space usage patterns will shape leasing velocity and effective rents. Any sign that high?end urban offices are filling up faster than expected would be a powerful catalyst. Third, Boston Properties’ own capital allocation choices, from asset sales and development pipelines to potential joint ventures, will signal how aggressively management intends to play offense versus defense.

If long?term yields drift lower and the economy avoids a deep recession, Boston Properties could continue its slow drift higher, with total returns bolstered by its dividend. In a less benign scenario of sticky inflation, delayed rate cuts, or a renewed shock to office demand, the stock could quickly retest the lower end of its recent range. For now, the market seems content to grant Boston Properties the benefit of the doubt, but not yet the premium valuation it enjoyed before hybrid work rewrote the rules of office real estate.

Investors considering a position today are effectively placing a measured bet that prime urban offices will remain relevant, even if the sector never fully returns to its pre?pandemic vibrancy. Boston Properties, with its scale, experience, and portfolio quality, is one of the clearest ways to express that view. Whether the quiet rally of recent days proves to be the start of a more durable re?rating or just another pause in a long, choppy sideways market will depend on data that have yet to arrive, from leasing reports to central bank decisions.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405005_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 15:59:11.791459

SoftBank Group has completed its previously announced roughly $40 billion investment in OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, fulfilling the largest private tech funding commitment in history.

As reported by CNBC, the Japanese investment powerhouse confirmed that the final transaction — estimated at $22 billion to $22.5 billion — was transferred last week, after earlier installments of $8 billion and $10 billion were already deployed.

The massive infusion deepens SoftBank’s stake in OpenAI to more than 10%, underscoring its ambition to be a central force in the next era of intelligent computing.

Softbank makes big moves to get deal done

To fund this massive commitment, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son sold SoftBank’s entire $5.8 billion stake in Nvidia and offloaded $4.8 billion of its T-Mobile holdings. The company even slashed staff and slowed most other Vision Fund dealmaking to a crawl to prioritize this OpenAI investment.

SoftBank’s completed investment reflects a broader recalibration of its portfolio toward artificial intelligence and related technologies. To fund its OpenAI commitment and other AI bets, the group has undertaken substantial asset sales, including divesting its stake in Nvidia — generating roughly $5.8 billion in liquidity that was redirected into its AI strategy.

Just days before announcing the completion of its OpenAI funding, the company revealed plans to acquire DigitalBridge, a US digital infrastructure investment firm focused on data centers and fiber networks, for about $4 billion.

That deal, expected to close in late 2026, would further bolster SoftBank’s ability to build the computational backbone that next-generation AI systems require.

What the deal means for OpenAI

The completion of this deal solidifies OpenAI’s position as one of the most heavily backed AI developers in the industry. The funding round originally valued the company at about $300 billion post-money, making it one of the largest private technology financings ever recorded.

OpenAI plans to channel a significant portion of this capital into expanding its infrastructure and research capabilities, including strategic projects that aim to drive next-generation AI technologies and services.

Among these is the Stargate initiative, a sprawling joint venture with SoftBank, Oracle, and others designed to build out AI compute infrastructure across the United States and beyond.

Die Aktie hat nach einem zwischenzeitlichen Ausflug nach oben inzwischen die Kraft wieder verloren. Der erhoffte Aufstieg auf mehr als zwei Euro ist am Ende nicht gelungen.

Plug Power: Die künftigen Sitzungen werden sehr wichtig!

Jetzt kommt darauf an, die Unterstützungen nach unten zu bewahren. Bei rund 1,52 Euro würde der so genannte GD 200 warten. Dies ist der langfristige Trendindikator, der für die Identifikation von langfristigen Trend-Entwicklungen bedeutend ist. Wenn die Aktie auch noch in dieser Richtung den Boden verlieren würde, wäre der vormalige Aufwärtstrend endgültig beendet.

Das Papier leidet wohl vor allem daran, dass es am Ende doch zu wenig Aufträge und neue Projekte gibt. Der Umsatz würde in diesem Jahr auf 702 Millionen Dollar geschätzt. Das Netto-Ergebnis wird derzeit an den Börsen mit einem Minus von – 900 Millionen Dollar offensichtlich als schwach eingeschätzt. Insofern auch im kommenden Jahr noch kein wahnsinniger Durchbruch erwartet wird, der Umsatz zum Beispiel soll sich um 20 % nach oben bewegen, war die Begründung für den vormaligen Aufwärtstrend nicht besonders nachvollziehbar.

CNBC previously reported that SoftBank was finalizing a $40 billion investment in OpenAI at a $260 billion pre-money valuation, adding that this funding would help support OpenAI’s AI infrastructure Stargate joint venture with Oracle and SoftBank.

Tuesday’s news followed a series of reports about OpenAI’s fundraising plans, including one from The Information that the company was aiming to raise as much as $100 billion at a valuation of about $750 billion.

Days earlier, The Wall Street Journal reported that OpenAI was seeking up to $100 billion in a funding round that could value the company at $830 billion. Another report the same week said that Amazon was in discussions to invest around $10 billion in OpenAI and that the investment could value the startup at $500 billion.

Also this month, OpenAI received a $1 billion investment from The Walt Disney Company, while also signing a groundbreaking three-year licensing agreement that will let its Sora video model generate brief, fan-created clips using more than 200 Disney-owned characters, settings and worlds.

As PYMNTS reported Dec. 11, soon after the Disney deal was announced, the agreement illustrates that a studio can develop a structured licensing model that uses AI and while also protecting creative rights. Disney can still control the scope of generated content, remove creations that violate standards and update the rules as the technology evolves.

“The company also gains early access to AI models that may support future production methods, including rapid previsualization, localization and internal creative assistance,” the Dec. 11 report said. “OpenAI gains access to one of the most globally recognized character libraries. The company said it will adapt Sora to operate within legal and creative limits and work with Disney on enforcement systems that stay aligned with the agreement.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/softbank.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 15:59:30.897924

Strength in the commercial aerospace market, driven by strong growth in orders from the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and the aftermarket verticals, is driving the Aerospace/Defense segment. The robust backlog level, along with the company’s strong execution on incremental orders in the commercial aerospace market, is expected to be beneficial for the segment. An increase in demand for the company’s bearings and engineered component products in the defense market, supported by growth in marine and missile applications orders, will also continue to augur well for the segment in the quarters ahead.

RBC is also benefiting from strength in the Industrial segment. Stable demand for its highly engineered bearings and precision components in food & beverage, grain, aggregate & cement, parcel & baggage and warehousing markets bodes well.

RBC Bearings solidified its product portfolio and leveraged business opportunities through asset additions. In July 2025, RBC acquired VACCO Industries from ESCO Technologies for about $275 million in cash. The inclusion of VACCO’s expertise in engineered valves, regulators and manifolds, supported by its strong designing, engineering and production capabilities, will enable the company to expand its customer offerings in the defense, space and commercial markets. In the fiscal second quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended September 2025), VACCO contributed $24.7 million in net sales to the Aerospace & Defense segment.

The company is committed to rewarding its shareholders handsomely through dividend payments and share buybacks. Though it did not pay any dividend or repurchase shares in the first six months of fiscal 2026, in fiscal 2025, RBC paid preferred stock dividends of $17.2 million and repurchased shares for $9.5 million.

Price Performance of RBC

In the past year, this current Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have risen 52.7% compared with the industry’s 9.5% growth.

However, weak refinery demand is affecting the oil and gas end markets, which remains a persistent concern for RBC. Also, softness in the semiconductor equipment market due to a slowdown in the overall manufacturing sector might impede the company’s growth in the near term.

RBC Bearings is currently dealing with the rising cost of sales. Increasing raw material costs are pushing up the cost of sales. In the first six months of fiscal 2026, the company’s cost of sales and SG&A expenses increased 11% and 10.4%, respectively. High costs and expenses, if uncontrolled, may adversely impact the company’s margins and profitability in the quarters ahead.

Summary

Parker-Hannifin is a high-quality industrial company whose share price now embeds growth assumptions we view as unrealistic.

Most industrial segments are flat or declining while nearly all profit growth comes from aerospace, increasing concentration risk.

With buybacks likely redirected toward deleveraging, a key technical support for the stock is fading.

At current valuation levels, even solid execution leaves little margin for error, leading us to a STRONG SELL conclusion.

Thesis

There are many ways sell-side analysts try to find a company’s “fair” value — some useful, others pure illusion. The DCF method is like a massive LEGO set: every tiny assumption has to fit just right, and it opens the door to bias — overconfidence, hindsight, and anchoring. The multiples approach seems easier — compare with peers — but it assumes those peers are fairly priced, which history rarely supports. Reverse valuation flips the process: it starts from the market price and discount rate, then works backward to reveal the free cash flow assumptions already baked into the price. It’s valuation without the fluff — a direct reality check on what the market actually believes. We use a Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE) model to measure what truly belongs to shareholders: Earnings + Amortization – CAPEX – average acquisition cost = FCFE. We ignore working capital and debt changes — they’re noisy and not part of the core business. Everything boils down to three numbers: earnings, amortization, and investments. For forecasts, we apply the H-model (a 10-year two-stage growth fade) with the terminal growth equal to the risk-free rate (RFR) — the 10-year government bond yield. All cash flows are discounted by the cost of equity = RFR × beta + 5% ERP. The result: a clean, noise-free picture of what the business is really worth.

One under-the-radar chipmaker is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the next growth stage of this market. It specializes in semiconductor products that titans like NVIDIA don't build. It's just beginning to enter the spotlight, which is exactly where you want to be.

Top 5 High-Yield S&P 500 Stock to Buy for 2026

The U.S. stock market has experienced significant volatility at the beginning of 2025 owing to a multitude of factors. The trade policy framework undertaken in the new Trump administration has reshaped market sentiment. The aggressive tariff measures imposed by Washington on its major trading partners have left several businesses in a state of uncertainty. The growing Sino-U.S. trade tension was a concerning factor for investors. The U.S. government aims to limit Beijing’s access to high-end technologies. It has imposed restrictions on the export of advanced semiconductor tech to China.

The tariff-related uncertainties have significantly affected companies with a strong presence in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. Moreover, the war in Europe and the Middle East has further aggravated the market uncertainty. These developments have led to rising manufacturing costs and supply chain issues, putting pressure on margins. However, there were some positive macroeconomic developments as well in 2025. The federal reserve rate cuts have lowered borrowing costs and improved corporate profitability.

Trade-related risks and changes in monetary policy led to frequent stock price fluctuations. However, broader market momentum remained positive with tech stocks largely leading the bull run. Growing spending on AI infrastructure and digital transformation is driving growth in the tech sector. Despite a hike in energy prices, the overall annual inflation rate was lower than expected in 2025.

Key Growth Drivers for 2026

Rapid AI buildouts are expected to be a key driver for businesses in 2026. Businesses in several industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy, social ecommerce, telecom and others are rapidly incorporating AI across the portfolio to gain a competitive edge. However, this rapid AI build-out requires substantial computing infrastructure, data centers to support these AI workloads, as well as energy optimization and cooling technologies.

AI integration has become capex-heavy. There is a gap between investing in AI infrastructure and realizing gains from this investment. The growth in AI capex is expected to put pressure on the balance sheet and can create margin pressure in the short term. The companies with stable earnings and robust cash flow are expected to be the gainers amid such emerging market trends.

China is a major supplier of rare earth materials that many major tech companies rely on. This can force the United States to avoid imposing high tariffs and maintain a cordial relationship with the Communist nation, at least in the near term. However, the U.S. government’s effort to reduce the widening trade deficit with other nations indicates that tariff-related uncertainties will remain a concern for investors in the upcoming quarters. After three rate cuts in 2025, the chances of another rate cut remain low, at least at the beginning of 2026.

Amid such macroeconomic uncertainties and persistent geopolitical volatility, there is a growing interest in S&P 500 stocks with high dividend yield. So far in 2025, the average dividend yield of S&P 500 stocks stands at 1.07%. Based on above average dividend yields, strong fundamentals and growing AI-related investment, we have shortlisted five stocks that have strong growth potential in 2026.

U.S natural gas production and demand both reach record highs in 2025, with a 16 percent increase in recoverable supply helping meet rising domestic and global demand. At the same time, global oil demand continued to grow, with the International Energy Agency projecting the world will require an additional 25 million barrels per day in new oil and gas projects over the next decade.

After years of policies that constrained investment and delayed infrastructure, the industry delivered measurable results in 2025. LNG export approvals resumed, long-overdue permitting reform advanced, and production records continued to fall, strengthening national security, supporting the economy, and keeping energy affordable for American households. Federal forecasts show U.S. LNG exports climbing to an average of 14.7 billion cubic feet per day in 2025, up from a record 11.9 billion cubic feet per day in 2024.

These outcomes marked a clear shift from the prior policy approach, which prioritized restrictions over reliability and slowed critical energy infrastructure development. In 2025, the Trump administration’s renewed focus on energy dominance and infrastructure realigned federal priorities with market demand, restoring momentum across the energy sector and unlocking new opportunities for growth.

Here’s a look at the highlights from 2025:

Permitting Reform Gains Momentum

Permitting reform gained strong support in 2025 as lawmakers, industry leaders, and business groups pushed to modernize outdated approval processes that delay critical infrastructure. Following Congress’s return from the August recess, a diverse coalition urged Congress to streamline reviews, reduce delays, lower costs, and boost energy investment.

The letter, signed by a broad cross-section of business and energy groups, including the Independent Petroleum Association of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers, stated:

“The time has come to modernize our nation’s permitting systems so that our communities can build the infrastructure necessary to grow our economy, create good-paying jobs, and meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.”

By modernizing permitting processes and reducing approval delays, critical energy infrastructure can be built faster to meet rising demand and address grid constraints. Streamlined approvals also help lower project costs and support economic growth, enabling more reliable and affordable energy for American households.

The National Petroleum Council (NPC) reinforced this urgency in a new report that underscored that permitting challenges create structural vulnerabilities in the nation’s energy system, contributing to price volatility, supply insecurity, higher costs, and job losses.

Energy Secretary Wright, who commissioned the NPC report, called its findings an important step forward:

“The National Petroleum Council’s findings confirm what President Trump has said from day one: America needs more energy infrastructure, less red tape, and serious permitting reform. These recommendations will help make energy more affordable for every American household.”

Momentum continued to build toward the end of the year. In December, the House advanced the bipartisan SPEED Act, which would overhaul the National Environmental Policy Act, and passed the PERMIT Act, targeting Clean Water Act reforms designed to reduce permitting backlogs. Together, these measures signal meaningful progress toward faster, more predictable permitting outcomes.

LNG Exports Resume and Break Records

Following the LNG moratorium under the previous administration, the U.S. Department of Energy officially reopened LNG export authorizations in early 2025. The move restored regular order to the LNG approval process, as required under the Natural Gas Act. Record-setting exports followed throughout the year, demonstrating that domestic prices remain stable even as American LNG reaches global markets.

In 2025, the United States set LNG export records for four consecutive months, further demonstrating the resilience of the U.S. energy system. The United States now supplies 55 percent of Europe’s LNG, helping EU countries reduce reliance on Russian gas.

According to the International Gas Union’s Global Gas Report 2025, Asia and other emerging economies drove the bulk of global gas demand growth in 2024, while global LNG demand is projected to rise by another 71 Bcm in 2025. This highlights that U.S. LNG exports are critical not just for Europe but also for meeting fast-growing energy needs in Asia.

With LNG exports poised to double, North American export capacity is projected to grow from 15.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) to nearly 30 Bcf/d by 2029, an increase of 13.9 Bcf/d according to EIA estimates. This expansion positions the U.S. to meet European energy security needs while supporting rising demand in Asia, American jobs, and long-term economic growth.

During an interview with Axios, Jarrod Agen, executive director of the White House National Energy Dominance Council, captured the global demand for American energy:

“It’s Europe, it’s Asia. They are looking for U.S. energy. They want to get off of Russian energy sources, and we have such a supply.”

U.S. LNG exports have already provided over 273,000 American jobs and are projected to generate $166 billion in tax revenue through 2040, with additional projects under construction expected to amplify these benefits.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright summarized the global importance of U.S. LNG exports in May 2025:

“The facts are clear: expanding America’s LNG exports is good for Americans and good for the world.”

Offshore Production Expands

In 2025, Congress and the administration prioritized expanding offshore energy consistent with the President’s energy dominance agenda. Early in the year, one of the first House Committee on Natural Resources’ oversight hearings highlighted the importance of restoring offshore oil and natural gas development.

Momentum continued in the fall when a federal court reaffirmed presidential authority over offshore leasing, clearing the way for new development. In November, the Interior Department followed with a major offshore leasing expansion, covering waters off California, Florida, and Alaska. These actions align with the Department of the Interior and BOEM’s Five-Year Offshore Leasing Plan (2026–2031), which proposes up to 34 lease sales across the Gulf of America, Alaska, and the Pacific coast. By providing long-term clarity and predictability, the plan encourages investment, supports thousands of jobs, and strengthens U.S. energy security.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum emphasized the importance of these developments:

“Through a transparent and inclusive public engagement process, we are reinforcing our commitment to responsible offshore energy development—driving job creation, bolstering economic growth, and strengthening American energy independence. Under President Donald J. Trump’s leadership, we are unlocking the full potential of our offshore resources to benefit the American people for generations to come.”

Offshore energy continues to deliver substantial economic benefits. activity in the Outer Continental Shelf supported 250,000 jobs and $59.5 billion in economic output. In 2025, BOEM held Lease Sale Big Beautiful Gulf 1, generating over $300 million in high bids for 181 blocks. This sale reflects strong industry confidence in U.S. offshore energy and continued growth across the sector.

Future offshore leasing is projected to produce 2.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day through 2040 , while maintaining stringent environmental standards. Gulf operations continue to emit significantly less per barrel than most other producing regions worldwide.

Alaska Energy Resurgence

Alaska’s energy sector regained momentum in 2025 as coordinated federal and state actions focused on unlocking the state’s vast resource potential. On his first day in office, President Trump signed the executive order Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential, supporting the Alaska LNG project, reopening access to leases in ANWR and NPR-A, and encouraging responsible resource development.

State leaders praised the move as a critical step toward strengthening energy security and affordability. Senator Lisa Murkowski wrote in a statement:

“The policies laid out in this Executive Order will improve our economy, our budget, and our quality of life while simultaneously making energy more affordable and enhancing national security. Alaska is the blue chip in the United States’ energy portfolio, and I thank President Trump for helping us capitalize on our resources.”

EIA forecasts show Alaska crude oil production is expected to grow in 2026 for the first time since 2017, driven by projects such as Nuna and Pikka—marking the largest annual increase since 2002 and signaling renewed long-term production strength.

Source: Energy Information Administration (EIA), 2025

According to the Alaska Oil & Gas Association, the industry supported more than 69,000 jobs and $5.9 billion in wages in 2022, underscoring its importance to Alaska’s economy and national energy supply.

Record Production While Reducing Emissions

Even through increased demand and renewed energy dominance, U.S. producers continued to demonstrate that record production and emissions reductions can advance together. Methane emissions intensity in the Permian Basin dropped by more than 50 percent from 2022 to 2024, even as the basin contributed nearly half of U.S. oil production and over 20 percent of natural gas output.

Source: S&P Global Commodity Insights, 2025

This year’s Environmental Partnership report highlighted how nationwide methane emissions declined 40 percent since 2015, even as production increased by more than 50 percent.

Return to Realistic Energy Expectations

Also notable in 2025 is that the International Energy Agency (IEA) returned to its core mission of providing objective, market-based energy analysis. After years of speculative scenarios that assumed peak fossil fuel demand by 2029, the IEA reinstated its Current Policies Scenario, projecting continued growth in oil and natural gas demand through 2050.

As Bloomberg reported:

“The annual report being prepared by the International Energy Agency shows decades more of robust fossil-fuel use, with oil and gas demand growing over the next 25 years — not just possible, but probable.”

The shift is more than academic. Banks, investors, and governments rely on IEA modeling to guide infrastructure and energy security decisions. The return to tried-and-tested demand projections has already produced tangible benefits: renewed investment in oil and gas projects, stabilization of energy markets, and clearer signals to policymakers on infrastructure priorities.

After years of underinvestment that risked future shortages, banks reversed course and renewed commitments to oil and natural gas development. Similarly, from Massachusetts and New York to California and Pennsylvania, policymakers quietly reopened the door to natural gas infrastructure, delayed unrealistic emissions targets, and backed away from climate litigation. Together, these developments signal a return to pragmatic energy expectations and policies grounded in reality.

Looking Ahead to 2026

The momentum built in 2025 sets the stage for continued U.S. energy leadership in 2026. Permitting reform, expanded offshore development, and renewed investment in Alaska will remain central to meeting growing global demand. Europe is actively reducing reliance on Russian energy, while Asian markets are increasing imports of U.S. LNG.

At home, think tanks and policy experts are stressing energy strategies that bolster economic competitiveness and grid reliability while accounting for growing electricity needs from AI, data centers, and electrification. AI and data centers are driving significant electricity demand in North America and Asia, highlighting the need for flexible, reliable natural gas to stabilize grids and integrate renewables efficiently.

U.S. energy remains a critical tool for allies and a foundation of domestic prosperity. 2026 will be a year where energy leadership, pragmatic policy, and technological innovation converge to provide reliable, affordable, and globally impactful energy.

Bottom Line

2025 reinforced that the United States can lead the world in energy production while strengthening the economy, meeting global demand, and reducing emissions. With policy reform, infrastructure investment, and continued innovation, the U.S. oil and natural gas industry enters 2026 positioned to deliver affordable, reliable energy at home and abroad.",https://www.energyindepth.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/EID-EOY-post-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 14:01:12.354967

Dutch Bros Introduces Grocery Store Creamers

Dutch Bros recently introduced its grocery store creamers, marking one of the brand’s first major retail moves beyond ready-to-drink coffees and packaged offerings. These creamers were available on shelves in a few supermarkets and are now expected at Walmart in 2026.

Social media sightings by Snackolator are showing the first varieties to be Chocolate Macadamia Nut x Annihilator, Vanilla Caramel x Golden Eagle creamer, and the third one is ‘inspired by Caramelizer’. In addition, up to four 64-ounce cold brew coffee products are expected to launch in the near future.

It is anticipated that these creamers are produced using real cream, milk, and natural flavors and are leaning toward the Dutch Bros signature rich and sweet taste profile that clients enjoy in their cafe drinks.

According to a post by Markie Devo, some shoppers have begun spotting the products at retailers such as Albertsons.

Customers have also started to leave their reviews online, with some even complimenting the new creamers on their morning coffee.

Dutch Bros’ Broader Retail Expansion

The current retail expansion is in line with the larger strategy of Dutch Bros to expand its reach into grocery stores. The company has been strategizing to venture into consumer packaged goods, such as ready-to-drink coffees and other products, and this launch of creamer is just a small step in a bigger move into the retail market.

Obviously, I’m a Ford driver, so it’s good for all of us if the car wins.","In Revised Michelin Endurance Cup Role, Rockenfeller has Long Race Focus in 2026

By Tony DiZinno

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – Although he’s now 42, Mike Rockenfeller is practically ageless. He still looks as young and drives as fast as his younger teammates within the Ford Multimatic Motorsports stable of Mustang GT3 drivers. He can easily be viewed one of sports car racing’s greatest drivers, ambassadors and gentlemen of the millennium with his affable attitude and incredible insights.

The German driver best known as “Rocky” made his early mark coming up the sports car ladder with two distinct German brands: Porsche and Audi. In 2010, he won both the Rolex 24 At Daytona and 24 Hours of Le Mans overall in the same year; the Rolex aboard an Action Express Racing Riley-Porsche closed cockpit Daytona Prototype and Le Mans in a factory Audi R15 TDI Plus diesel LMP1 open prototype. He’s the second most recent driver to do that, as Fernando Alonso did so in 2019 with a Cadillac DPi-V.R at the Rolex 24 and a Toyota TS050 Hybrid in LMP1 at Le Mans.

But in recent years, “Rocky’s” manufacturer presence has been distinctly American. He raced both GT and Daytona Prototype Corvettes off-and-on through the mid-2010s, and then was the sports car expert who guided Jimmie Johnson, Jenson Button and the Hendrick Motorsports collaborative Garage 56 Chevrolet Camaro ZR1 to take NASCAR back to Le Mans in 2023. He also ran select NASCAR Cup Series races for Johnson’s Legacy Motor Club team when it still ran Chevrolets.

Since 2024, “Rocky” has been a “blue oval” man through and through. He’s been back in a full-time seat in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship as part of Ford’s Grand Touring Daytona Pro (GTD PRO) effort, and through the end of 2025, was the only driver Ford kept in that full-time role for both seasons.

For 2026, things change a bit. After Rockenfeller and Harry Tincknell shared the No. 64 Ford Mustang GT3 in 2024 and Rockenfeller and Seb Priaulx then partnered to be the proverbial veteran and young charger pairing in 2025, both “Rocky” and “Sebby” shift to Michelin Endurance Cup roles in 2026 split between the Nos. 64 and 65 cars.

Rockenfeller seems to feel something different with Ford than he did with the German brands he raced with earlier in his career. As he reflected during the IMSA-sanctioned November test, being part of Ford means going back more than a century and building on it as Ford continues its global motorsports ramp-up to be one of the world’s most pre-eminent motorsport manufacturers.

“Where I’ve come from, I was not surprised… but at Charlotte when they did the season launch two years ago, I’d just joined the program so I only understood it somewhat,” Rockenfeller explained. “But they do NASCAR. Off-road. Baja. Obviously sports car racing. They will do F1. Then Hypercar/GTP… yes, it’s Europe for now, but hopefully they come to the U.S. It’s unreal how big their program is. The Red Bull F1 thing I hope will be very successful, super cool and exciting. The range they go is unreal.”

Ford’s perception is changing globally, too, he noted.

“For me coming from different brands and joining a new one, in Europe, Ford is a different brand than what it is in the U.S.,” Rockenfeller said. “Here, it’s massive. There, the Germans are quite big. That’s normal.

“But I always had friends driving Ford. A friend of mine in go-karts has three Ford dealerships. I always looked at it, but I never imagined I’d race for Ford. To get to know the family and Jim Farley and all of them, (Mark) Rushbrook, it’s such a family. And they’re emotional with racing. They really love it, and you can see it in the programs they do.”

Rockenfeller then proceeded to tell just how much of the Ford family presence the manufacturer wanted to share with its drivers.

“The first year in Detroit, we went to the Henry Ford House, where he basically lived. It’s kind of a museum almost,” he said. “It’s unreal to hear the stories; Edsel and that. It’s unreal. To hopefully write some history together is great. I feel such a part of it. To identify, it takes a bit of time. You need to know the cars, the people, and success and not success together. Year three … this year changed a lot for me. I feel like I’m there now.”

Indeed, the leap Ford made in IMSA from year one in 2024 to year two in 2025 with the Mustang GT3 was paramount. Rockenfeller won the Motul Pole Award for the Rolex 24 and the duo finished third with third driver Austin Cindric, who was deputizing for the injured Ben Barker. The sister No. 65 car won the Rolex with Frederic Vervisch, Christopher Mies and Dennis Olsen.

Ford’s No. 64 car enjoyed major success as the year progressed with two wins on the streets of Detroit – notably cast against the corporate headquarters and backdrop of crosstown rivals General Motors – and then the six-hour TireRack.com Battle On The Bricks in Indianapolis. With one other podium (second at Road America), Rockenfeller and Priaulx finished third in GTD PRO points.

“Every victory is special in its own,” Rockenfeller admitted. “Detroit is the only street circuit (for GTD PRO). It’s cool scenery and it’s different. I love to race in cities anyway but that’s the only chance on the calendar to do so. We don’t do Long Beach. Then obviously that’s the home race for Ford Motor Company and GM is there. It’s a big battle between us. To come out on top was the highlight.

“Indy was so cool; we were second the year before. We knew it was a strong place for us. To win with ‘Sebby’ was good as we just started working together this year and it turned out to be a pretty good combo.

“Then at Indy, it was special to have the whole family (as part of new IMSA Resilient Racers program) there enjoying it, taking the pictures, being on the podium. Especially as a father of three, you understand what matters in life. You think racing is the most important or when you’re doing it. But there’s a lot more in life, to share emotions and give something back. That’s very special.”

For 2026, Rockenfeller will share the No. 64 car with Olsen and Barker, who are set to embark on the full-season effort. That means Rockenfeller’s IMSA goal for 2026 is trophy hunting at the three longest Michelin Endurance Cup rounds, and notably, adding another Rolex watch to his 2010 one. Missing out in 2025 stung, he admitted.

“In the end, to win you need to be perfect,” he said. “The other car had a better setup and we didn’t. The last two tenths, probably. They deserved it! I’m happy they did. Obviously, I’m a Ford driver, so it’s good for all of us if the car wins.

“In the end we had a strong season. I’m sure the big goal is to win the championship. If you ask me what do you prefer, I don’t know if I would pick between 24 and the championship. Probably the championship. It gives a better picture of the whole year.

“But at Daytona, I’d like to get a free watch and not have to buy one!”",http://www.imsa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2025/12/22/IMSA_Rocky26_123025_1.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 13:00:46.640649

Before you invest, you may want to review the fund's prospectus, which contains more information about the fund and its risks. You can find the fund's prospectus and other information about the fund, including the statement of additional information and most recent reports to shareholders, online at www.bny.com/investments. You can also get this information at no cost by calling 1-800-373-9387 (inside the U.S. only) or by sending an e-mail request to info@bny.com. The fund's prospectus and statement of additional information, dated December 31, 2025 (each as revised or supplemented), are incorporated by reference into this summary prospectus.

The fund seeks capital appreciation.

This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy, hold and sell shares of the fund. You may pay other fees, such as brokerage commissions and other fees to financial intermediaries, which are not reflected in the table and examples below. You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in the fund or shares of other funds in the BNY Mellon Family of Funds that are subject to a sales charge. More information about sales charges, including these and other discounts and waivers, is available from your financial professional and in the Shareholder Guide section beginning on page 9 of the prospectus, in the Appendix on page A-1 of the prospectus and in the How to Buy Shares section and the Additional Information About How to Buy Shares section beginning on page II-1 and page III-1, respectively, of the fund's Statement of Additional Information.

* Class A shares bought without an initial sales charge as part of an investment of $1 million or more may be charged a deferred sales charge of 1.00% if redeemed within one year.

+ The fund's investment adviser, BNY Mellon Investment Adviser, Inc., has contractually agreed, until December 31, 2026, to waive receipt of its fees and/or assume the direct expenses of the fund so that the direct expenses of none of the fund's share classes (excluding Rule 12b-1 fees, shareholder services fees, taxes, interest expense, brokerage commissions, commitment fees on borrowings and extraordinary expenses) exceed .68%. On or after December 31, 2026, BNY Mellon Investment Adviser, Inc. may terminate this expense limitation agreement at any time.

Example

The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund's operating expenses remain the same. The one-year example and the first year of the three-, five- and ten-years examples are based on net operating expenses, which reflect the expense limitation agreement by BNY Mellon Investment Adviser, Inc. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover

The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or ""turns over"" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 95.20% of the average value of its portfolio.

To pursue its goal, the fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in stocks. The fund may invest up to 30% of its net assets in foreign securities. Newton Investment Management North America, LLC, the fund's sub-adviser, identifies potential investments through extensive quantitative and fundamental research. The fund focuses on individual stock selection (a ""bottom-up"" approach), emphasizing three key factors: value, sound business fundamentals and positive business momentum.

The fund typically sells a stock when the fund's sub-adviser believes there is a more attractive alternative, the stock's valuation is excessive or there are deteriorating fundamentals, such as a loss of competitive advantage, a failure in management execution or deteriorating capital structure. In addition, at times, the fund may engage in active and frequent trading, which will increase portfolio turnover.

An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit. It is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. It is not a complete investment program. The fund's share price fluctuates, sometimes dramatically, which means you could lose money.

·Risks of stock investing: Stocks generally fluctuate more in value than bonds and may decline significantly over short time periods. There is the chance that stock prices overall will decline because stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and falling prices. The market value of a stock may decline due to general market conditions or because of factors that affect the particular company or the company's industry.

·Value stock risk: Value stocks involve the risk that they may never reach their expected full market value, either because the market fails to recognize the stock's intrinsic worth or the expected value was misgauged.

·Market risk: The value of the securities in which the fund invests may be affected by political, regulatory, economic and social developments, and developments that impact specific economic sectors, industries or segments of the market. In addition, turbulence in financial markets and reduced liquidity in equity, credit and/or fixed-income markets may negatively affect many issuers, which could adversely affect the fund. Global economies and financial markets are becoming increasingly interconnected, and conditions and events in one country, region or financial market may adversely impact issuers in a different country, region or financial market. These risks may be magnified if certain events or developments adversely interrupt the global supply chain; in these and other circumstances, such risks might affect companies world-wide. Local, regional or global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or other public health issues, recessions, elevated levels of government debt, changes in trade regulation or economic sanctions, internal unrest and discord, or other events could have a significant impact on the fund and its investments.

BNY Mellon Dynamic Value Fund Summary

·Foreign investment risk: To the extent the fund invests in foreign securities, the fund's performance will be influenced by political, social and economic factors affecting investments in foreign issuers. Special risks associated with investments in foreign issuers include exposure to currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive and less publicly available company information, political and economic instability and differing auditing, accounting and legal standards.

·Portfolio turnover risk: The fund may engage in short-term trading, which could produce higher transaction costs and taxable distributions, and lower the fund's after-tax performance.

·Management risk: The investment process used by the fund's sub-adviser could fail to achieve the fund's investment goal and cause your fund investment to lose value.

The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The bar chart shows changes in the performance of the fund's Class A shares from year to year. Sales charges, if any, are not reflected in the bar chart, and, if those charges were included, returns would have been less than those shown. The table compares the average annual total returns of the fund's shares to those of the Russell 1000® Index, a broad measure of relevant market performance, and the Russell 1000® Value Index, an index reflecting the market segments in which the fund invests. The fund's past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the future. Performance for each share class will vary due to differences in expenses. More recent performance information may be available at www.bny.com/investments.

The year-to-date total return of the fund's Class A shares as of September 30, 2025 was 12.75%.

After-tax performance is shown only for Class A shares. After-tax performance of the fund's other share classes will vary. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on the investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their shares through U.S. tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.

The fund's investment adviser is BNY Mellon Investment Adviser, Inc. (BNYIA). BNYIA has engaged its affiliate, Newton Investment Management North America, LLC (NIMNA), to serve as the fund's sub-adviser.

Brian C. Ferguson, John C. Bailer, CFA and Keith Howell are the fund's primary portfolio managers. Mr. Ferguson has been the fund's lead portfolio manager since September 2003 and is a portfolio manager at NIMNA. Mr. Bailer has been a primary portfolio manager of the fund since December 2004 and is Deputy Head of Equity Income and a portfolio manager at NIMNA. Mr. Howell has been a primary portfolio manager of the fund since September 2021 and is a portfolio manager at NIMNA.

If you purchase shares through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the fund's distributor and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. To the extent that the intermediary may receive lesser or no payments in connection with the sale of other investments, the payments from the fund's distributor and its related companies may create a potential conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your financial representative to recommend the fund over the other investments. This potential conflict of interest may be addressed by policies, procedures or practices adopted by the financial intermediary. As there may be many different policies, procedures or practices adopted by different intermediaries to address the manner in which compensation is earned through the sale of investments or the provision of related services, the compensation rates and other payment arrangements that may apply to a financial intermediary and its representatives may vary by intermediary. Ask your financial representative or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.

The Japanese investment giant sent over a final $22 billion to $22.5 billion last week, according to the sources familiar with the matter. SoftBank had previously syndicated $10 billion and invested $8 billion in the ChatGPT maker.

The investment takes SoftBank's stake in the company above 10%.

CNBC reported in February that the company was finalizing a $40 billion investment in the Sam Altman-run startup at a $260 billion pre-money valuation.

At the time, sources told Faber that the funding would be paid out over a 12 to 24 month period. Some money was slated to support OpenAI's artificial intelligence infrastructure Stargate joint venture with Oracle and SoftBank.

Companies have been spending big in recent months to build out infrastructure to support a frenzy for AI solutions and growing compute needs.

Over the years, SoftBank has been betting big on technology and AI companies and was an early investor in chipmaking giant Nvidia. On Monday, the conglomerate agreed to pay $4 billion for data center investment firm DigitalBridge to strengthen its AI push.

Last month, the SoftBank liquidated its entire $5.8 billion stake in major AI beneficiary and chipmaker Nvidia . A source familiar with the matter told CNBC that the sale, combined with other cash sources, would support its OpenAI investment.

The startup, which is reportedly preparing for an IPO, has received billions in funding over the years from tech juggernaut Microsoft .

Published December 30, 2025

Lewes, Delaware RMIQ, an AI-powered cross-retail media network platform, today announced the expansion of its platform with the integration of several large-scale retail media networks across grocery, general merchandise, and specialty retail categories. This strategic expansion strengthens RMIQ's position as a comprehensive solution for brands and marketers looking to manage and optimize advertising spend across multiple retail environments.

The newly added networks enhance RMIQ's growing ecosystem, which already includes top retail media networks from a dozen regional retail media platforms. With these additions, advertisers can now execute and manage campaigns across an even broader range of grocery, general merchandise, and specialty retail channels through a single, unified platform.

Retail media continues to experience rapid growth as brands seek direct access to consumers closer to the point of purchase. However, managing campaigns across multiple retail media networks often leads to data fragmentation, operational complexity, and inefficient budget allocation. RMIQ addresses these challenges by offering a centralized, AI-powered platform designed to streamline cross-network campaign management and improve return on ad spend.

""The expansion of our retail media integrations represents a significant milestone in our mission to simplify cross-network advertising management,"" said Matt Drela, CEO of RMIQ. ""Brands can now reach consumers across multiple retail categories while maintaining consistent oversight, transparency, and optimization of their advertising investments.""

With access to advertising inventory across diverse retail segments--including grocery delivery, general merchandise, and specialty retail--brands can develop cohesive retail media strategies aligned with multiple shopping occasions and consumer touchpoints.

RMIQ's artificial intelligence technology continuously analyzes performance data across integrated networks, identifying optimization opportunities and delivering actionable insights. This approach helps marketers reduce wasted spend, allocate budgets more effectively, and improve overall campaign efficiency, while minimizing the operational burden of managing multiple retail media relationships.

As the retail media ecosystem continues to evolve, RMIQ remains focused on helping brands navigate complexity and unlock greater value from their advertising investments through integrated technology and cross-network intelligence.

The S&P Global Russia Services PMI Business Activity Index edged up to 52.3 in December from 52.2 in November. Readings above 50 denote growing activity, while ‌below 50 indicates contraction.

The slight rise ‌in December was attributed to stronger customer demand and a solid increase in new business, which grew at its fastest rate since May.

Despite this growth, service providers reduced ​staffing levels for the first time in six months, and at the fastest rate in nearly ‍three years. The reduction ​was primarily due to a decrease in ​full-time workers, as business confidence waned.

Pressure on capacity was ‍evident, with backlogs of work accumulating at the fastest pace in a year, while firms reported higher new order inflows.

Operating expenses rose at the slowest rate since May 2009, with firms noting higher ‍transportation and supplier costs but reduced wage bills. Firms sought to pass on their higher costs by raising their ‍selling prices, ‍albeit at a slower pace than ​in previous months.

Business confidence dipped, with ​optimism at ⁠its second-lowest level since January 2023, ‌although firms remained hopeful for stronger demand conditions and new service lines.

Our latest independent report examines recent figures and market trends.","While much of the technology investment community remains focused on Nvidia's multi-billion dollar acquisition of Groq, a notable divergence is occurring with Adobe. Recent regulatory filings reveal that several prominent institutional asset managers have significantly pared back their stakes in the software giant. This selling pressure coincides with Adobe's shares trading approximately 24% below their peak for the year.

A Closer Look at the Filings

The latest round of 13F filings, made public this Tuesday, shows a coordinated reduction in Adobe exposure among key investors. The moves present a clear pattern of divestment.

Perigon Wealth Management cut its Adobe holding by 33%, disposing of 3,589 shares.

Boston Trust Walden Corp sold over 12,000 shares, reducing its position by nearly 14%.

Ethic Inc. also retreated, decreasing its stake by 12.7%.

This institutional pullback appears strategically timed. It aligns with a significant sector rotation within technology, triggered by Nvidia's $20 billion deal for AI chipmaker Groq on December 24, 2025. That blockbuster transaction has redirected investor attention squarely toward the hardware layer, where semiconductors and data centers are perceived to offer a faster path to monetization compared to software applications.

Strong Fundamentals Contrast with Market Sentiment

The wave of selling stands in paradox to Adobe's solid operational performance. The company's quarterly results for its fourth fiscal year, reported on December 10, exceeded market expectations.

Revenue reached $6.19 billion, marking a 10.5% year-over-year increase and surpassing the consensus estimate of $6.11 billion.

Adjusted earnings per share came in at $5.50, beating the forecast of $5.40.

The non-GAAP operating margin was a robust 45.6%.

Adobe continues to successfully integrate generative AI across its product suite through its Firefly models. However, the current market environment demands tangible proof of how AI features translate into incremental revenue, forcing software companies into a ""show-me"" phase that is testing investor patience.

Analyst Consensus Stays Bullish

Despite the stock's weakness and institutional selling, Wall Street's outlook remains decidedly positive. Data from TipRanks shows a clear ""Strong Buy"" consensus, comprising 19 buy recommendations, four hold ratings, and a single sell suggestion. The average price target among analysts sits at $460, implying an upside potential of roughly 30% from current levels.

For the 2026 fiscal year, Adobe's management has provided revenue guidance in the range of $25.9 billion to $26.1 billion. From a technical analysis perspective, the stock is currently hovering around a key support level near $350. A sustained move above the $400 threshold would be needed to signal a meaningful improvement in its chart pattern. Until the next quarterly report in March, the share price is likely to remain vulnerable to ongoing sector rotations.

There is a gap between investing in AI infrastructure and realizing gains from this investment. The growth in AI capex is expected to put pressure on the balance sheet and can create margin pressure in the short term. The companies with stable earnings and robust cash flow are expected to be the gainers amid such emerging market trends.

China is a major supplier of rare earth materials that many major tech companies rely on. This can force the United States to avoid imposing high tariffs and maintain a cordial relationship with the Communist nation, at least in the near term. However, the U.S. government’s effort to reduce the widening trade deficit with other nations indicates that tariff-related uncertainties will remain a concern for investors in the upcoming quarters. After three rate cuts in 2025, the chances of another rate cut remain low, at least at the beginning of 2026.

Amid such macroeconomic uncertainties and persistent geopolitical volatility, there is a growing interest in S&P 500 stocks with high dividend yield. So far in 2025, the average dividend yield of S&P 500 stocks stands at 1.07%. Based on above average dividend yields, strong fundamentals and growing AI-related investment, we have shortlisted five stocks that have strong growth potential in 2026.

Dec 29 (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are lowering prices of their top-selling obesity drugs Wegovy and Mounjaro in China, according to the Danish ​drugmaker and Chinese drug suppliers.

Novo did not give details on the new prices, ‌but media outlet Yicai reported earlier that list prices for the two highest dosages of Wegovy were cut by ‌48% to 987 yuan ($141) and 1,284 yuan per month respectively in some Chinese provinces.

Lilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Prices for Lilly's Mounjaro would also decrease from January 1, according to ‍a WeChat account for a hospital in the eastern city of Nanjing posted late last week. It did not say how much prices would be slashed.

A platform for China's leading food delivery group Meituan ​listed a 10mg Mounjaro injector pen at a projected cost of around 445 yuan ($63), ‌down from 2,180 yuan.

Over 65% of China's population of around 1.4 billion could be overweight or obese by 2030, making it a rapidly growing market for weight-loss drugs.

Both drugmakers are competing with rivals including Innovent Biologics and face the prospect of further competition after Novo's patent on Wegovy's active ingredient semaglutide expires in 2026 in China and some other important markets.

Chinese ⁠drugmakers, including CSPC Pharmaceutical Group and Hangzhou Jiuyuan ​Genetic Biopharmaceutical Co, are developing their own versions of ​the drug.

Yicai, citing local procurement authorities, had reported that the Novo price cuts would be made in the southwestern Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan.

Novo ‍slashed Wegovy prices by ⁠up to 37% in India last month, as it looks to gain ground in another fast-emerging market for obesity treatments. Novo and U.S. rival Eli Lilly - both ⁠shifting towards cash-paying consumers - also agreed to cut U.S. prices in November.

Air Liquide S.A. is one of those companies that rarely makes consumer headlines, yet its products sit behind almost everything that defines a modern economy: chips, steel, refineries, vaccines, data centers, even coming hydrogen highways. As a global leader in industrial gases and increasingly in low-carbon hydrogen and clean technologies, Air Liquide S.A. has turned oxygen, nitrogen, argon and hydrogen into a full-stack product portfolio that looks less like a commodity play and more like a mission-critical platform.

Where consumer tech chases eyeballs, Air Liquide S.A. chases uptime, purity and decarbonization. Its gases and on-site solutions are baked into 24/7 manufacturing and healthcare workflows with contracts that can run a decade or more. That combination of technological depth, high switching costs and green transition exposure is what makes Air Liquide S.A. particularly interesting right now — both as a product ecosystem and as the backbone of the Air Liquide Aktie investment story.

Inside the Flagship: Air Liquide S.A.

Talking about Air Liquide S.A. as a single product is a bit like calling Amazon ""a website"". In reality, it is a layered system of technologies, services and long-term contracts wrapped around one core capability: producing, conditioning, transporting and managing gases at industrial scale with extreme reliability and increasingly low carbon intensity.

At the base layer sit the traditional air gases: oxygen, nitrogen, argon and rare gases produced in large air separation units (ASUs). These plants can deliver bulk liquids by truck, feed entire industrial basins via pipeline networks or be embedded on customer sites as captive units. Above that, Air Liquide S.A. has built specialty gas and electronics product lines for semiconductors, flat panels and photovoltaics, where purity and process control are critical differentiators.

Alongside these, hydrogen has become the strategic flagship vertical for Air Liquide S.A. The company develops and operates large-scale hydrogen production assets (both conventional and low-carbon), liquefaction facilities, storage, distribution systems and refueling stations. This is not just about fuel-cell cars; it targets heavy-duty mobility, refining, chemicals and, increasingly, green steel and maritime applications. Modular electrolyzer projects and large joint ventures with energy majors and utilities are positioning Air Liquide S.A. as a central integrator in emerging hydrogen corridors.

Another key layer is healthcare. Air Liquide S.A. supplies medical gases to hospitals and homecare patients, integrates medical devices and monitoring platforms and offers services around chronic disease management. This segment gives the overall product mix a defensively stable, highly regulated backbone that tends to be less cyclical than industrial manufacturing.

Underpinning all of this is a heavy digitalization push. Air Liquide S.A. has been rolling out predictive maintenance, remote operations centers and AI-driven optimization across its production and pipeline networks. Smart sensors monitor purity, pressure and energy use; control algorithms reduce consumption and emissions; remote operations allow more flexible uptime management. These tools turn what might be seen as commodity infrastructure into a data-rich, optimized service layer that customers increasingly cannot replicate or replace cheaply.

The unique selling proposition of Air Liquide S.A. is this mix of breadth and stickiness. It doesnt just sell molecules; it sells availability, quality, compliance and decarbonization as a service. Long-term take-or-pay contracts for on-site units, pipeline network lock-in, and the sheer complexity of qualifying alternative suppliers in highly regulated industries set a high bar for competitors. At the same time, the company can cross-sell low-carbon variants, efficiency upgrades and new hydrogen or electronics solutions into its installed base.

Market Rivals: Air Liquide Aktie vs. The Competition

The industrial gas world is an oligopoly, and Air Liquide S.A. plays in a tight league with a handful of global rivals. The most direct competitors are Linde plc, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., and, in specific regional and segment battles, Japans Nippon Sanso Holdings Corporation.

Compared directly to Linde plcs global industrial gases and engineering portfolio, Air Liquide S.A. looks like a similarly diversified giant, with both companies racing to dominate low-carbon hydrogen, carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure and high-purity electronics gases. Linde historically had a stronger engineering arm in gigantic turnkey plants, while Air Liquide has leaned into agile project structures and partnerships. In electronics, Air Liquide S.A.s Advanced Materials and ultra-high purity lines are increasingly pitched as a rival ""one-stop shop"" to Lindes semiconductor offering, particularly in Europe and Asia.

Compared directly to Air Products and Chemicals hydrogen mobility and large-scale syngas projects, Air Liquide S.A. offers a broader, more balanced portfolio. Air Products has made bold bets on massive blue and green hydrogen projects in the Middle East and North America, often with large single-counterparty offtake. Air Liquide S.A. instead tends to build network effects through hydrogen clusters and multi-customer industrial basins, especially in Europe. That makes its hydrogen product positioning look more like infrastructure-as-a-platform than a series of megaprojects.

Compared directly to Nippon Sanso Holdings electronics-focused gas solutions, Air Liquide S.A. plays the global scale card. Nippon Sanso is a formidable specialist across East Asia in semiconductor and electronics gases, but Air Liquide S.A. matches the portfolio and adds large integrated networks in Europe and North America. For chipmakers looking to secure multi-continent capacity and standardized specifications, Air Liquide S.A. can pitch full-lifecycle coverage from R&D lines to gigafabs.

Where does Air Liquide S.A. fall short? On headline growth narratives, pure-play hydrogen stories like Air Products can appear more aggressive. On certain engineering megaprojects, Linde still commands a reputation as the go-to partner. And in local Asian markets, Nippon Sanso or regional players often have deeper domestic roots. But across the three pillars of industrial basins, hydrogen and electronics, few players match the balanced, global reach of Air Liquide S.A.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

The real edge of Air Liquide S.A. is that it has quietly reshaped itself from a classical industrial gas supplier into a critical infrastructure and climate-tech platform, without giving up the defensive characteristics of its legacy business.

1. High switching costs and contractual stickiness. On-site plants tethered to customer operations, connected via dedicated pipelines and embedded into production recipes are not trivial to replace. Customers in refining, chemicals, metals and semiconductors usually think in 10- to 20-year cycles. Once Air Liquide S.A. is in, it tends to stay in, providing long-term revenue visibility and a springboard to upsell low-carbon variants, efficiency services and digital optimization.

2. Decarbonization as an upsell, not a pivot. Unlike pure-play green hydrogen startups trying to displace incumbents, Air Liquide S.A. can decarbonize from the inside. It already owns and operates conventional hydrogen and oxygen infrastructure; adding carbon capture, renewable-powered electrolysis or low-carbon logistics becomes a product upgrade path. For customers, that lowers the friction and risk of decarbonization projects. For Air Liquide S.A., it turns climate regulation into a structural demand driver rather than an existential threat.

3. Balanced portfolio: electronics, healthcare, industry and mobility. Semiconductor demand is cyclical but structurally rising as AI, cloud and automotive electronics multiply chip content. Healthcare tends to be more defensive, smoothing out industrial downturns. Heavy industry decarbonization and emerging hydrogen mobility provide long-duration growth options. This blend makes Air Liquide S.A. resilient across economic cycles in a way that many energy-transition pure plays are not.

4. Digital operations as a force multiplier. IoT-enabled plants, centralized control rooms and data analytics are turning Air Liquide S.A.s core product into a continuously optimized service. Operating hundreds of complex plants with shared learnings and real-time benchmarking can drive efficiency gains that smaller or less integrated rivals struggle to match. For customers, that translates into lower energy use, fewer unplanned shutdowns and precise quality control; for Air Liquide S.A., it compresses operating costs and carbon footprint simultaneously.

5. Partnership-heavy growth model. Rather than owning every asset outright, Air Liquide S.A. has leaned into joint ventures and co-investments with energy majors, utilities and infrastructure funds. That speeds up deployment of hydrogen clusters, electrolysis projects and carbon capture hubs while keeping capital intensity in check. It also creates political and commercial alignment in key regions, especially in Europe, North America and the Middle East.

Put together, these advantages make Air Liquide S.A. look less like a cyclical industrial supplier and more like an essential, regulated-adjacent infrastructure player with secular growth levers tied to decarbonization, digitization and chip demand.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

On the market side, investors track the performance of Air Liquide Aktie (ISIN FR0000120073) as a proxy for the health and credibility of this entire industrial gas and hydrogen platform.

Using real-time data from multiple financial sources, Air Liquide Aktie was recently quoted in the vicinity of its all-time high range. As of the latest available intraday data pulled from at least two major finance portals (including one European and one global data provider) on the afternoon of the most recent trading day, the stock was trading around the mid-80s in euros, with a market capitalization solidly above the 80 billion mark. Where markets were closed, pricing referenced the last official close. Across those sources, the share price and daily move were consistent, confirming the reliability of the snapshot.

That price range reflects how the market reads Air Liquide S.A. today: part resilient utility, part growth platform. The core industrial gas and healthcare activities support steady cash flows and a reliable dividend that appeals to long-term, income-oriented investors. On top of that, the companys investments in low-carbon hydrogen, carbon capture and electronics gases inject a growth layer that pure utilities lack.

Each new long-term contract in hydrogen mobility, each electrolyzer or industrial basin decarbonization project and each capacity addition for electronics gases effectively amplifies the product story of Air Liquide S.A. and supports the equity narrative of Air Liquide Aktie. When customers commit to decades-long offtake agreements tied to climate goals or wafer capacity expansions, they are not just buying gas; they are underwriting Air Liquides future cash flows.

Risks remain. Capital expenditure needs are high, regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon pricing are still evolving, and competition from Linde, Air Products and regional players is intense. Missteps on execution or policy could compress returns on large projects. But the breadth and stickiness of the underlying product ecosystem of Air Liquide S.A. give the company more degrees of freedom than narrower climate-tech bets.

For now, the market is signaling cautious confidence: Air Liquide Aktie tends to trade at a premium valuation to many traditional industrial peers, more in line with other global gas majors, pricing in both defensive qualities and a modest growth premium tied to the energy transition.

In other words, the stock is a high-level financial readout of a low-profile but increasingly central product story: Air Liquide S.A. is turning invisible molecules into visible infrastructure for a decarbonized, electronics-heavy world. As hydrogen corridors lengthen, fabs scale up and climate policy shifts from talk to enforcement, that product story and the Air Liquide Aktie that mirrors it is likely to stay on investors radar.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405032_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 11:05:41.830802

The total impact on adjusted earnings per share is expected to be around $0.20, divided equally between 2025 and 2026, reflecting charges related to Halda employee equity, financing, and integration costs.

J&J innovative medicine worldwide chairman and executive vice president Jennifer Taubert said: “This strategic milestone underscores our commitment to redefining cancer treatment with breakthrough science and transformative medicines.

“We are excited to formally welcome the talented Halda team to J&J and look forward to working together to achieve our shared goal of eliminating cancer.”

J&J innovative medicine R&D executive vice-president John Reed said: “Now that we have finalised this acquisition, we will focus on advancing the potential of this promising pipeline of novel product candidates and harnessing the powerful RIPTAC platform to discover more molecules in oncology and beyond.”

In November 2025, J&J signed a definitive agreement for the acquisition of Halda.

2025 saw the rise of “low-and-no” alcohol options and fitness-based gatherings, as nearly a third of consumers (31 per cent) said they have changed how they socialise in the last 12 months. Two in five (41 per cent) of those aged 18-34 say they now like to combine social catchups with exercise such as meeting for a gym class, cycle or run, while 48 per cent opt to socialise in ways that support health and wellbeing).

This wellness trend is leading many to cut back on nights out – two fifths (44 per cent) of adults reported going on fewer nights out in 2025, with spending at bars, pubs and clubs declining -0.2 per cent year-on-year, after experiencing 3.6 per cent growth in 2024.

Karen Johnson, Head of Retail at Barclays, said: “While confidence in the UK economy has declined, UK households’ confidence in their ability to manage their money has remained strong, translating into the resilient performance of categories such as travel, entertainment and beauty. It is encouraging to see that through purposeful spending, consumers continue to prioritise the things that bring them joy, unlocking the potential for UK economic growth.”",https://catererlicensee.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Paymen-credit-card-pub.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 05:59:01.121891

Nvidia has established itself as one of the most extraordinary growth companies in the global technology sector. Over the past two fiscal years, its revenues have risen from levels close to $60 billion annually to well above $120 billion, driven by the explosive demand for chips used in artificial intelligence, data centers, and accelerated computing, transforming its financial profile in an exceptionally short period.

This progress is reflected not only in sales but also in profitability. Nvidia has reported gross margins above 70% and operating margins close to 60%, figures far exceeding the semiconductor industry average, which typically ranges between 20% and 30%. In terms of returns, ROE remains above 70%, and ROA exceeds 35%, metrics more typical of software companies than hardware manufacturers. This performance has led to a sharp revaluation in the stock market. The shares have gained several hundred percent over three years, pushing the market capitalization above $3 trillion. As a result, valuation multiples have expanded significantly, with a P/E ratio remaining above 40 times forward earnings, compared with a sector average of around 20 times.

The PEG multiple also reflects demanding expectations. In many scenarios, it exceeds 1.5, suggesting the market is pricing in earnings growth of 30%-40% annually for several consecutive years. This leaves little room for error, as any slowdown could trigger abrupt valuation adjustments.

The dispersion among valuation models is notable. Depending on whether annual revenue growth of 20%, 25%, or 30% is assumed over a five-year horizon, fair value estimates can differ by hundreds of billions of dollars. This wide range reflects uncertainty over how long the current artificial intelligence expansion cycle can be sustained.

From a strategic perspective, Nvidia remains a central player in the transition toward accelerated computing. It is estimated to control more than 80% of the AI accelerator market in data centers, allowing it to capture a disproportionate share of global AI infrastructure spending and reinforcing its pricing power and elevated margins. Nevertheless, the risk profile is high. The stock's historical volatility exceeds the broader market average, with double-digit quarterly moves following earnings releases or shifts in macroeconomic expectations. In addition, reliance on advanced manufacturing processes limits operational flexibility and exposes the company to potential supply chain bottlenecks.

This is compounded by increasingly intense competition. Direct rivals are seeking to gain market share with alternative solutions, while large technology companies are developing specialized in-house chips, which could reduce Nvidia's marginal growth as the artificial intelligence market moves toward a more mature phase.

In conclusion, Nvidia offers an exceptional combination of growth, profitability, and technological leadership, supported by figures that few companies in the sector can match. However, the current valuation requires the company to sustain very high growth rates for several years. The true challenge is not finding leadership, but maintaining it over time, as any deviation from the expectations priced into the market could lead to a significant share price correction.",https://www.opalesque.com/images/opalesque-small-logo-21.png,N,,2025-12-30 08:59:39.513750

Semaglutide however, affects Alzheimer's disease proteins in the right direction, as seen in biomarker measures, Koychev said.","Steve Christo - Corbis | Corbis News | Getty Images

Novo Nordisk has had a difficult year: a tumbling stock price resulting in the biggest leadership shakeup in the company's 100-year history as investors turned their back on the Danish drugmaker and its weight loss business.

It seemed investors had largely given up on Novo's ability to translate its strides in pioneering GLP-1 drugs to financial gains as the lucrative market attracts new players. Scientists, however, say that the medicine still has potential.

What started with a focus on the drug's ability to manage weight and blood sugar, and combat related conditions such as heart disease, is now expanding further with growing interest in how it might also impact the brain.

Semaglutide, or as it is better known, Ozempic and Wegovy, is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that was originally developed for diabetes patients to manage their blood sugar levels. However, it quickly became prescribed by doctors off-label en masse as its appetite surpressing and weight-loss properties became known. Today, it is approved for anti-obesity purposes and brings in billions annually for its maker, Novo Nordisk.

Now, the medical community is discovering a growing list of added benefits from these drugs.

""Wegovy promotes weight loss and potentially other mechanisms not fully understood,"" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wrote in a statement in August when it approved the drug for treating liver disease. Semaglutide is also cleared by regulators to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in overweight people with cardiovascular disease, as well as to treat chronic kidney disease in diabetes patients.

Meanwhile, a rival drug by U.S. competitor Eli Lilly , tirzepatide (known as Mounjaro and Zepbound), which also targets the GLP-1 hormone as well as another gut hormone called GIP, is approved for treating moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in adults with obesity.

But the benefits may not end there. Amid increased competition, additional indications have become a new frontier for drug developers alongside new formats like pills.

GLP-1s and the brain

Observational studies have shown that GLP-1s appear to quiet cravings not just for food, but also for alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs, as they affect the brain's reward pathway. By seemingly changing dopamine signals in the brain, these drugs could reduce cravings and allow the individual to be more rational when faced with tempting options.

""There is interest in understanding the potential of semaglutide on various brain functions,"" Laura Nisenbaum, executive director at Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF), told CNBC.

""Understanding that inflammation and energy usage in the brain is going to be so important for our normal cognitive function,"" Nisenbaum said. Recognizing that link will be useful in many different neurological and neuropsychiatric indications where changes or damage to the brain impact mood, behavior or cognition, she added.

Evolving data suggest that semaglutide and rival drug tirzepatide made by Eli Lilly might be the first effective ""anticonsumption"" agents with the potential to treat excessive food cravings, obesity, alcohol consumption, nicotine addiction, recreational drug use, and even uncontrollable shopping behaviors, a study by researchers at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute and University of Missouri found.

Another small-scale randomized clinical trial found that low-dose semaglutide reduced alcohol consumption and significantly reduced cravings compared to placebo in patients with alcohol use disorder over nine weeks of treatment. The results justify larger clinical trials of incretin therapies for alcohol use disorder, the researchers concluded.

The Alzheimer's disappointment that wasn't

Another potential added benefit of this class of drugs could be how it interacts with the dementia process.

In November, Novo disappointed investors when it published data on a two-year-long clinical trial testing whether semaglutide could slow down cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Hopes had run high that the medicine might be able to help people suffering from the most common type of dementia, as it had been observed in real-world studies that diabetes patients taking semaglutide developed Alzheimer's at a lower rate than those who didn't.

But the late-stage trial failed to meet its main goal, showing that semaglutide didn't significantly impact cognition in Alzheimer's patients. Novo said it would discontinue a one-year extension of the trial due to the results.

However, some scientists told CNBC it shouldn't be seen as a failure. They say that even if the results were disappointing, it was a well-conducted trial that the science community was able to learn from.

""It just gave a negative result as far as the drug is concerned in that particular population,"" said Ivan Koychev, associate professor in neuropsychiatry at Imperial College London.

Semaglutide however, affects Alzheimer's disease proteins in the right direction, as seen in biomarker measures, Koychev said. ""They're impacting Alzheimer's disease-linked proteins, they reduce their quantity in the cerebrospinal fluid, which suggests that it is interacting directly with the alternative pathology.""

There was also an observed reduction in systemic inflammation biomarkers, according to Novo. ""The thinking is that it may be this anti-inflammatory effect that, if it is implemented early enough in the disease process, you can substantially modify the risk of dementia,"" Koychev said.

""The signal was always in the prevention space rather than the treatment space,"" he added.

Similarly, Nisenbaum said a next useful step would be to test semaglutide and other GLP-1s earlier in the course of the disease as a preventative therapy.

Novo Nordisk said it was reviewing all data from the trial, but that it was too early to speculate any further on the effect semaglutide might have on dementia patients.

The science versus the Street

Despite the fact that the innovations developed by Novo have the potential to significantly impact public health, many investors have turned their back on the company over the past 18 months as its growth prospects face challenges.

Novo shares are having their worst year on record since listing on Nasdaq Copenhagen over three decades ago. At its peak in mid-2024, the stock traded at above 1,000 Danish kroner. Today, it trades at around 320 kroner.

The stock's year-to-date drop of 50% is being driven by increased competition from U.S. rival Eli Lilly and so-called compounding pharmacies making cheaper, copycat versions of semaglutide. A failure to convince investors that its pipeline will bring significant financial gains amid a flurry of hopeful market entrants also adds to the pressure.

The Alzheimer's trial data readout in November led shares to drop 5.8% on the day, despite analysts saying it was always a long shot and Novo management themselves called it a ""lottery ticket,"" — underlining its highly uncertain outcome.

The two Alzheimer's drugs currently on the market, Eli Lilly's Kisunla and Biogen/Eisai's Leqembi have been shown to slow down the progression of Alzheimer's disease by up to a third but come with the risk of severe side effects.

These medicines were studied 15 years ago, and there were many negative studies along the way, ADDF's Nisenbaum said. ""Each one, we learned something that then led to an improvement in understanding our patients in the clinical trials and then how to measure what's happening in them.""

""It's absolutely about the long game,"" she added, hopeful that semaglutide or other novel drugs that target risk factors could be used in combination with Kisunla and Leqembi.

But the market doesn't see it like that, and there are many reasons why.

First of all, investors' time horizons are much shorter than the decades-long process it typically takes to bring a drug to market, meaning pharmaceutical development often clashes with the speedier pace of public markets. Adding new indicators for a drug also takes time, as they need to be backed up by often lengthy clinical trials.

Secondly, semaglutide is facing key patent expiries in 2031 and 2032, which will give the green light to others to make generic versions of semaglutide.

""We don't see a good argument for a valuation floor,"" Jefferies analysts said late November, noting that Novo now enters the 5-year patent expiry window with no real moat.

""Lower U.S. prices may stimulate additional volume demand and enhance patient retention, but we are not of the view that, at these prices, generics and compounders cannot compete,"" they added, rating shares at Underperform.

Pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices for Americans, and the threat of high import taxes, have served as additional headwinds for Novo, as well as for many of its pharma peers over the past year.

Goldman Sachs analysts, led by James Quigley, are slightly more optimistic. ""We remain Buy-rated on Novo Nordisk, as while expectations have reset sharply downwards for near/medium-term estimates, we continue to believe there could be some volume opportunity for Novo as the obesity market evolves,"" they wrote in a note late November.

""While Novo are unlikely to take a leading share, we still see opportunities for Wegovy, CagriSema and oral Wegovy to drive value in excess of what the market currently believes, although we acknowledge that this will likely take time and evidence of an uptick in scripts before investors give credit,"" they added.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108241956-1765822302147-gettyimages-2177724898-20241010-christo-ozempic-3612.jpeg?v=1765822418&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-12-30 05:59:05.274691

This was influenced by the slowdown of MBK Partners, the largest PEF in Asia, due to various controversies. Instead, domestic PEFs turned their attention to the middle market, leading a range of deals both large and small.

According to the investment banking (IB) industry on December 29, there were five trillion-won big deals led by PEFs this year. Of these, four were dominated by global PEFs.

The largest M&A deal this year was the sale of DIG Airgas, a global industrial gas manufacturer. Macquarie PE sold the company to French gas firm Air Liquide for 4.85 trillion won. Previously, Macquarie PE had acquired DIG Airgas from MBK Partners for 2.8 trillion won in 2020.

In addition, KKR acquired 100% of the shares in SK Ecoplant’s environmental subsidiaries-Renewone, Renewus, and Renew Energy Chungbuk-for 1.78 trillion won. EQT Partners acquired a 22.29% stake in software company Douzone Bizon from Chairman Kim Yongwoo for 1.3 trillion won, and earlier this year, Affinity Equity Partners acquired Lotte Rental, the number one company in Korea’s rental car industry, for 1.5729 trillion won.

Among domestic PEFs, Glenwood PE was the only one to successfully close a trillion-won deal. Glenwood PE acquired NanoH2O (formerly LG Chem’s water solutions division) for 1.4 trillion won.

Other domestic PEFs were active in the middle market M&A sector. Notable deals included VIG Partners’ acquisition of LG Chem’s aesthetics division (200 billion won), Stick Investment’s acquisition of Cleantopia (600 billion won), Well to Sea Investment’s acquisition of SIFLEX (430 billion won), and Affirma Capital’s acquisition of waste management company CEK (400 billion won).

The most disruptive event in the domestic capital market this year was the Homeplus incident involving MBK Partners. Beyond a simple restructuring failure, the issue of responsible management by PEFs came under scrutiny, intensifying negative perceptions toward PEFs.

MBK Partners faced a crisis year. While Homeplus, which entered corporate rehabilitation proceedings, remains at a crossroads, a hacking incident at Lotte Card-where MBK Partners is the largest shareholder-sparked further controversy. In addition, the dispute over management control at Korea Zinc between Chairman Choi Yoonbum and the alliance of Young Poong and MBK Partners continues.

JKL Partners also faced challenges. After the M&A contract for bakery brand London Bagel Museum, suspicions arose over an employee’s death from overwork. Although this incident was not directly related to JKL Partners, ESG (environmental, social, and governance) risks surfaced, potentially stalling sales growth and putting JKL Partners’ crisis management capabilities to the test.

In the wake of these incidents surrounding PEFs this year, financial authorities moved to strengthen regulations on PEFs. First, a one-strike-out policy will be introduced, allowing for the cancellation of registration for management companies (GPs) after a single major legal violation. In addition, PEFs will be required to regularly report the assets, liabilities, and liquidity status of acquired companies to the financial authorities. The authorities aim to propose the relevant legal amendments within the year, targeting passage in the first half of next year.

Although the PEF industry faced a difficult year, expectations are rising as several trillion-won big deals are anticipated for next year.

First, as early as January, the fate of golf brand TaylorMade-expected to fetch around 4 trillion won-will likely be decided. In the main bidding process led by Centroid Investment, U.S. golf-focused investment firm Old Tom Capital emerged as a leading candidate for preferred bidder status, offering about $3 billion (approximately 4.4 trillion won). If a preferred bidder is selected, F&F, which holds preemptive rights, must decide whether to match the terms and acquire TaylorMade within 14 days.

SK Microworks Solutions, estimated to be worth 2 trillion won, has also recently begun its sale process. The largest shareholder, Hahn & Company, has selected UBS and a major domestic accounting firm as sale managers, seeking overseas buyers while also pursuing a dual-track strategy by contacting domestic strategic investors (SIs). Classys, in its fourth year under Bain & Company, is also on the market, with the sale price expected to be in the 3 trillion won range.

An IB industry official stated, ""This year, the M&A market contracted due to high interest rates and policy uncertainty, leading many trillion-won deals to briefly surface before disappearing again. While next year’s market conditions may not be easy, some of the issues that dampened the market are being resolved, which gives us hope.""",https://cphoto.asiae.co.kr/listimglink/6/2025123009182373305_1767053904.png,N,,2025-12-30 11:05:54.196156

Travis Hoium: It's a day ending in y, and that means OpenAI is raising money again. Motley Fool Money starts now.

From Fool Global headquarters, this is Motley Fool Money. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. OpenAI is reportedly in talks to raise another $100 billion. Give or take at a give or take valuation of about $800 billion. This comes after Greg Brockman, one of their co-founders, said that the company had to make trade-offs about whether it had enough compute to build the next model or whether it was going to serve ChatGPT. The question is, how long can they keep raising money without having a profitable business model, Lou? That seems like a fundamental tension, and these numbers are getting absolutely enormous.

Lou Whiteman: Yeah, no, you're asking the right question, and I don't know if any of us know the answer, and that's the scary thing. Just for fun, I asked AI, ""How much money is there in the world?"" It depends on what OpenAI needs, but it feels like AI is going to just swallow everything right now. Look, here's the problem. OpenAI doesn't have the cash-generating machine that Meta has, that Microsoft has, that Alphabet has. That is turning into a significant disadvantage here. All these companies are doing amazing thing. Remember, at the beginning of OpenAI, when we just marveled at this tool, and we're like, wow, this is magic. But now Gemini is giving me that magic. Everybody's giving me that magic.

Travis Hoium: People are baking is spending $20 a month to get magic in their pocket.

Lou Whiteman: Right. Frankly, I'm one of those people. I'm having fun with AI. I'm exploring AI, but I'm not going to buy seven different models for this. They needed the WOW factor before. If the WOW factor is rolling off and they still need all of this money, I don't know where they go from here. We're seeing pushbacks all over the place. This is a real question. At some point, they need to get their financial house in order and figure out, either as Greg said, how to do more with less or what compromises they have to make here.

Travis Hoium: How do you think about this tension? We'll get to the stocks. I want to ask specifically about some of the companies that public market investors may or may not have some exposure to, but how do you think about this business that seems to be holding trillions of value in public markets up right now. Should we be worried about their business model, or should it just be about pushing the frontier forward with artificial intelligence as far and as fast as possible?

Asit Sharma: I think we should keep an eye on the business model. OpenAI made some really consequential choices which serve them well in the last few years. As Lou mentioned, the explosion of interest we had in generative AI and how the world has changed. It's really due to OpenAI stepping up and pouring so much money into its frontier models. And at the beginning, those models were meant to be everything for everyone. But as time goes on, I think it's become more important that these big models can't be Swiss Army knives. They're simply not. You have to focus at some point on your markets and how you're going to monetize. Interestingly enough, competitor Anthropic has openly said, ""Look, we're focusing on the enterprise market. We're not out to get the most retail customers. We see some profit here with deep-pocketed enterprise businesses, so that's where we're focusing our model.""

Travis Hoium: That's specifically coding. That's where they have been ahead of the game. It was probably a month ago now when Gemini 3 came out, that beat all benchmarks. It did not beat Anthropics Claude on some of the coding benchmarks, which then they even took another step further beyond that. But that does seem like if a mode is building in this business from a model standpoint, Anthropic does have the focus to be able to do that.

Asit Sharma: Yeah, in fact, I saw an interesting note on a Reddit thread, some developers the other day, which said, ""Okay, if you're prototyping something, maybe go to ChatGPT for the architecture conversation."" Go to Gemini for the implementation of it, but go to Sonnet or Opus for the coding of it. You hit this on the head, Travis, that all of these models now are getting better in certain parts, but to be dominant in every category is not something the other businesses still want to chase. OpenAI almost seems like it has to, but of course, they're talking now about making the appropriate trade-offs. To me, that means they're going to have to focus on that big wide funnel of the hundreds of millions of users that are avidly going to ChatGPT and talking to it every day and figure out how to get conversational commerce going. Move in that direction, you have to understand over the long-term, the cost of your compute, and how you can reasonably sell it. It's a really simple equation eight now. They still haven't figured it out.

Travis Hoium: They do seem to be leaning more toward that consumer side rather than the enterprise, they're not a hyperscaler themselves. Do they have to get into something like advertising or is a new business model, and we see this on the Internet? New business models come up when new technologies come around. Advertising does seem to be the thing that's a common thread here between all technologies. You can go back to television, radio. Now we're on the Internet, where it's all about advertising, and that's how you take away that pain point of somebody actually have to pay for something to watch a football game, for example. But that's fundamentally how they make the business work. Do they have to figure that out, or can they be a consumer company and do something else to make money?

Asit Sharma: They can't be a consumer company and do something else to make money and expect the types of margins that investors want at these valuation rounds. At the end of the day, they'll have to get margin for somewhere to make the latest entrance, the people are coming in with the next tens of billions into the hundreds of billions of investment into OpenAI, to make that payout worth it for them to raise more capital. I think behind the scenes, sure, they're talking about how they pull advertising in. We can already see from the partnerships that company is making to bring brands into their funnel, Shopify is one that this is absolutely where they're headed. Now, the other stuff that they're exploring some of it even sketchy, a G-rated show, so I won't get into it. But some of that they'll be at the margins, other ways they can monetize the consumer.

Lou Whiteman: Every business that we discuss that has margin almost in this space when we think about Clouds, it comes down to that. Alphabet with YouTube, Meta with any number of its advertising properties, Netflix, so on.

Travis Hoium: Lou, the impact on public markets, obviously, OpenAI isn't public. It's possible that they will IPO. You would think if you're raising money at $800 billion valuation, eventually those investors are going to want liquidity. That means going to the public markets. But the companies that are public, Oracle, CoreWeave, Nebius, these have been the hot names in AI. But they've all dropped precipitously, and they're the ones that are actually funding the acquisition of Nvidia chips. We talked about circular financing, but there is a circular almost business model here and financing model here that is starting to impact these public companies negatively. Is that something that we should be concerned about with OpenAI at the core?

Lou Whiteman: We should be watching it. I think it's the same question, though. All of this makes sense if it ends up making sense.

Travis Hoium: It works until it doesn't.

Lou Whiteman: If there is a pot of gold at the end of this rainbow, none of this is a problem. I think the question is, and what you guys are getting at is that, is there a pot of gold at the end of OpenAI's rainbow, and how do they get there? I think if nothing else, it's time to differentiate. It's time to not paint the entire sector with one brush and say, ""AI, good, which every trend, every innovation we've had has had winners and losers."" The question for OpenAI is back to what you're saying, consumer, business, whatever. Right now, they're in a position where they need to look for revenue. Wherever they can find it, and they need to look for investment wherever they can find it because they need a lot of money. They need more money than any one single source can do it. I respect that everything is on the table. However, just because they might be doing what they should, I don't know if that guarantees success.

Travis Hoium: Yeah, do you have thoughts on whether these companies? Are they building a house of cards? Is this a new phenomenal business model building data centers that we just haven't seen before? Where's its head at?

Asit Sharma: I think long-term, the investment in data centers is needed, and some companies are going to have some rough times in the future as demand and supply normalize. Whether that's three years from today or five years from today, or we read the tea leaves much sooner, and those companies get punished. I don't know about those time frames, but everything that we're seeing today is predicated a lot of it. Let's not say everything. A lot of it is predicated on what Sam Altman thought a few years ago, that the more of compute that we throw with these models, the better they'll get at different tasks and so we need to invest lots and lots of money to make way for that compute. Nvidia played into that. Jensen Huang is a firm believer in that. There's some proof in the pudding in that as we use these models and ask them to reason more, that entails more compute. But we've totally avoided the other side of the conversation, which is, how do we make this stuff more energy efficient? How do we make on the algorithmic side, this stuff more efficient? How do we make on the development of the models, this side, all of this more efficient? By avoiding those conversations, we're setting up a future in which it has to be like boom or bust for some companies. They're going to win on that big scaling model. That's where OpenAI has thrown its chips. There'll be lots of little players, too, smaller players who don't need all of that power, and I think something you want to talk about, Travis, is maybe Gemini's smaller models. Those are interesting and we can go there if there's time.

Travis Hoium: Yeah, I want to get to that next. We need to take a quick break. We will get to the recovery of Alphabet in 2025. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.

Lou Whiteman: Yeah, what a year it's been for Alphabet. The thing that they're reaping benefit from today is a lot of work that they did years ago.

Asit Sharma: There were some discussions, I think the Investment Community, maybe last year, the year before that, look, Alphabet ought to be able to catch up because it has deep expertise. In fact, Google scholars were the ones who came up with transformer technology that we're all riding off of today. But I would have been surprised if you told me that at the beginning of the year. How is it doing it? It's not having to focus again with these huge scaling laws as OpenAI has done, and they've made those choices. Alphabet has really deep expertise in smaller models, and they have the very deep pockets to go ahead and experiment and play around. You sent out a tweet and an image to me and Lou this week, which was basically discussing how good Gemini Flash 3 is. This is a smaller model from Gemini in terms of cost and compute efficiency. I'm not going to get into all the details here, except to say that and the 2.5 model from Gemini are really efficient. You point out one 10th the cost. Now, you have to keep in mind, you're probably referring to developers who are using the API, but still let's go there. Maybe a 10th the cost of, say, OpenAI and some of its competitors. What it does, it gives you a lot more intelligence for less money. If I could boil it all down. You may not want a genius level intelligence, but what if you want reasonably good intelligence for something that's sufficient, they've provided that.

Travis Hoium: Let's give an example there. Duolingo was one of OpenAI's biggest users, maybe even their biggest user of their API. The example there would be if you have a conversation with their advanced plan, you can have a conversation in a different language, and the AI we'll talk back to you. We'll have a conversation as you learn a language. That conversation maybe a tenth of the cost coming out out of this Gemini model versus a comparable OpenAI model. Is that the way to think about it? Now as the companies are going, how do we make money on this? That becomes a big piece of the equation?

Asit Sharma: I think so. It's slightly beyond my pay grade. I will say this the way I think of it myself is if you're a smaller developer and you've got a database, and you need to use the AI to develop a conversational bot, it is a lot cheaper for you to run that through Geminis model. What it costs you per token, you get so much more out of these models, so I think we can extrapolate safely. If you're an expert in AI, write back to us if we're wrong, but I think you can extrapolate and say, sure, they could potentially use that model. They are going to get everything that is Duolingo get everything it needs in terms of reasoning and also real time compute to provide you an excellent tutor, probably using that model, I would guess. For all intents and purposes, that's a good example.

Travis Hoium: Lou, when you look at the comeback of Google and Alphabet, is this just where we were headed from the start, and they are just using their power to bludgeon the competition or starve the competition, however you want to look at it, it's gonna be tough. I saw something today they have five of the ten most downloaded apps, free apps in the Apple App store. It just seems like there is so much power coming out of mountain view and OpenAI is going up against that.

Lou Whiteman: We love to talk about this as competitions, Sharks versus jets, whatever. But I think this is just businesses being rational businesses, and I don't think it is like they're going after OpenAI. I think Alphabet is just doing what it should be doing. The fear for a while now is that these models would be commodities. That basically, if all these models can essentially do the same thing, you're not going to pay for seven of them, and price is inevitably what you're going to look at. Alphabet has it, and I don't think this is a loan to Alphabet. I think it's bad news for OpenAI, but I think you're going to see this in a lot of the winners is that they have the ability to price competitively, and they're doing so. It is really lousy for OpenAI because they don't have the existing revenue streams. They don't have the ready access to especially corporate customers. But look, everything we're talking about, this is ASA was talking about efficiency. ASA was talking about energy use. This is everything we want to happen for humanity, for investors, for everything. I think it could be both bad news for OpenAI, but if we are getting to a point where these things are more cost competitive and they can actually be put to use by more companies, this is a good thing, and I don't think it's a surprise that Big Tech, the ones with all of the resources in the existing business, that they're the ones that can capitalize it over a start-up.

Travis Hoium: Lou, I want to ask you quickly about the market. We've been basically flat over the past month or so, but we're having a pretty good year up 16%, I think it is for the S&P 500. The interesting thing is the Fed started cutting rates, and yet the 10 year is up. How do you think about going into the end of the year at the start of 2026? Is the market starting to run out of gas, or is there something else going on?

Lou Whiteman: Look, we are always just a measure of conventional wisdom. It's always just like how many bulls and how many bears at a given moment. I hate when we try and read into things are going up, so they will continue or things are tough now, so it's a new paradigm or something like that. I think what we've seen that some of the benefit of the doubt, especially among the big AI companies, is fading, that there is just a hint of skepticism. All these things that people have been talking about for a year now, Travis, the buildout crypto all of the expenses, all of these just worrying signs that didn't really resonate in the market now are just inching in. Again, I don't want to predict the sky is falling. I don't want to predict that it goes down from here, just like I don't think six months ago, we should have said, it has to go up from here since it's not bothering. But again, back to what I said before, in every wave we've ever had, there have been winners and losers. I think there's just more of scrutiny and less benefit of doubt being given to everyone, and I think that's what's playing out in the.

Travis Hoium: I agree, Lou. I think the support that AI companies bring to the market means that capital is staying put. It's rotating around, and we're seeing different themes get money and then being sold. But overall, perhaps this keeps the markets at least level next year. I'm terrible at predicting these things, but we'll see 2026 is almost here. We'll be back in a moment. You're listening to Motley Pool Money.

Travis Hoium: We'd like to have a little fun in this segment. Today, I want to have Lou and Asit hand out candy or coal for some of the most important executives or people in finance throughout the year. Lou, I want to start with you. Brian Nichol has been one of the most important people in food, retail, now running Starbucks. Does he get candy or coal in his stocking this year?

Lou Whiteman: The key here is this year because Nicholas had a heck of a career, and I'm taking that away from him, but this has not been the year that he is going to want at the top of his Wikipedia page. I don't think he's getting coal from me. I worry about these yesterday's brands becoming growth stocks again in general I struggle with that. But look, the China joint venture, I think there's at least questions there. There's operational issues with what he's trying to do back to Starbucks. There's been employee action and Starbucks is a really tough company to get its Mojo back. The jury's still out. It's early, etc. I'm not going to declare it a failure, but there has been more questions than answers this year, and so I am not praising the Brian Nichol 2025. I'm sorry, I can't.

Travis Hoium: Asit?

Asit Sharma: I'll give him spot him another year. I think this is a really difficult business to try to turn around.

Travis Hoium: He did go from the King of the world to massive project moving from Chipotle to Starbucks.

Asit Sharma: Yes, it's easier to stay King of the world. I'm not sure I agree with all of the capital decisions that Starbucks has made, but I love at least the push to reinvigorate the brand, to bring it back to what it used to be. I'm not sure that's still possible, but I'll spot him a little bit of candy, like one peppermint candy cane. Ask me next year, and we'll see whether that turns a little more Cole or I'll give some more candy.

Travis Hoium: Lou, do you think that a brand like Starbucks can get back that magic? Can I just think about my I don't go Starbucks, particularly often, but when I do, you walk in there and there's a counter with 50 cups of coffee and people randomly grabbing them. It's just very different from 10, 20 years ago when it was a place that I would go do homework in college and people would just go hang out at Starbucks. That doesn't even seem to be possible in a lot of Starbucks today.

Lou Whiteman: This is a theme that I'm thinking a lot about. Maybe it's just old age, but companies that I think will do fine, but the stock, it's separating out the company and the stock. I think there's a place for Starbucks. I think you can get the magic back, and I still don't know if that pays off for investors as a real wow growth investment. I think it's possible, but I'm getting more and more skeptical about what worked before and inherits the Earth up ahead, and I think about that with Starbucks, Nike, so many of the brands that I'm so in love with over the years.

Travis Hoium: It'll be interesting to see what we look back on those brands being starting at the pandemic. That was a real turning point for a lot of the ways that we live. You can have a lot of opinions about that's Jerome Powell. Is he getting candy or coal in his stocking from you?

Asit Sharma: He's getting candy. Whatever you think of Jerome Powell, he and I both know what it's like to do your job well when your boss is constantly telling you, I just want you the heck out of here. I'll walk that back. I think our managers and leaders at the Motley Fool Love, all three of us. That was a little bit of a joke, but look, tremendous pressure went from a tightening cycle to an easing cycle this year ended the year with one more bit of quantitative easing. I think doing this against the backdrop of the enormous pressure of the interest rate environment we've been in, the inflation environment, also the supply.

Travis Hoium: Didn't have a lot of data the last couple of months.

Asit Sharma: Didn't have data to work off of. The supply imbalances in trade due to tariffs. There's a lot going on there, and I wonder if he didn't adopt some of the methods of one of his earlier predecessors, Alan Greenspan, who famously used to lie in the bath tub to relax and read economic figures. I would guess Jerome did a little bit of that this year, but he held his term, I believe, is up in May of next year. I'm going to give him some high marks. The man deserves a little bit of candy in his stocking.

Lou Whiteman: I'll give him a lot of candy, because everything was had said more, not just that his boss or the person who would like to be his boss giving him flack, but look, the markets got used to money being free. The markets became convinced that the only way we can benefit is if money was free. He was not only putting up with or trying to navigate pressure from above, but also, I think pressure from retail and pressure from New York and Wall Street. I think I'm showing my bias here, but I think his take on it that, no, we want to preserve our firepower and not run too fast, I agree with him on that. I think it took a ton of courage to not give in and to take all that. Nothing but candy for me and bathtub or wherever, enjoy your retirement room because you've earned it.

Travis Hoium: Let's move back to tech, and the company that's AI adjacent, we've been waiting for them to get into the AI game. Apple's Tim Cook. Seems like he's missed a lot in 2025. The VR headset was not a hit. Their AI strategy. I don't know what's going on. Yet, they're selling a ton of phones, and at the end of the day, that's what drives the business. Lou, where is your head at with Tim Cook, candy or coal?

Lou Whiteman: He's getting candy. Now, he might not get as much candy as Jerome. I might take some of Jerome Powell's candy and give it to Cook. But look, multiple things can be true. I don't buy the idea that Apple didn't fail at AI because Apple always comes in and innovates. Apple spent a lot of money trying to get AI right, and they didn't, it didn't go to script, so I don't think we can give them a pass on that. That said, everything we talked about, commoditized models, the importance of having revenue, of having a customer base. I think Apple ends up a winner in AI, just working with Tim and or working with. It turns out they didn't have to come up with their own model. I think they're fine. The next big thing is still a real question. You're right they haven't solved it. I'm not Tim Cook, but I don't know the answer there so that is lingering over them. But if nothing else, one of the best run companies in the world gets a solid B this year, even if not an A plus, and that's got to be worth some candy.

Asit Sharma: I'll agree with that. For me, Tim Cook gets two really small peppermint candy canes so there's 24 packs that come, let's give him 1/12th of those. Tim Cook did Tim Cook this year.

Travis Hoium: That's like a night for the kids at my house.

Asit Sharma: Yeah. But he did what we expected of him he is this operational genius. It doesn't matter what the environment is. I mentioned tariffs just a moment ago. He navigated all of that pretty flawlessly even look at the latest Apple models. They're starting to get traction in China again, which was a market. I thought they were going to have to at some point, just not write off, but.

Travis Hoium: It wouldn't have the dominant position they had for a long time.

Asit Sharma: Get used to being maybe a number two so they're still competitive there, and people still want their phones. The key question for Apple is who succeeds, Tim? Can we get someone who executes the level he does? Or do we need a visionary? Because the IP at Apple all the billions that have been poured into their IP is sitting there but has not been successfully monetized outside of its phones and its content. They've tried so many things over the years, like the Apple car. They made a stab at AI, but I agree with Lou. Maybe just partnering up is the way for them to go. There's so much that Apple could do as a company beyond their phone near monopoly for high end phones. I think that, look, this is the question, could you get someone who has a little bit of the Steve Jobs visionary capability in him or her with a lot of Tim Cook's operational excellence? It's a really tough question.

Travis Hoium: Have we ever seen a company do that? Go from visionary to operating person back to someone who is visionary, but at this scale that's the other thing is you're talking about one of the biggest companies in the world, somebody young, vibrant coming in and going, Hey, Tim, get out of the way. I'm coming in I got ideas.

Asit Sharma: With all this AI, you could construct an avatar that blends the two together. I have no idea how they're going to make this work.

Travis Hoium: It will be very interesting to see what happens with Apple over the next couple of years, especially with that succession planning. That seems like it's going to be a huge topic. Asit, I'm going to start with you with the next one. Sam Altman, candy or coal in his stocking.

Asit Sharma: I've been talking this around the margins, my opinion of Sam Altman this year. It's slightly some coal, a lump of coal. But for a more surprising reason, after everything we've discussed before, I think Sam really whiffed this year with ChatGPT 5.2. He talked that up in a way that we were ready to be blown away as we were in earlier years whenever they released a great new model, and it was really disappointing. In fact, I still go back sometimes to my 4.0 setting because that model of GPT just understands me so well. I love it so much. Are you listening, Sam? Sam, what did you do? Why did you do this? Why did you not understand that talking up a product that was not going to change the world is not a great strategy when you're going out competing in this battlefield, sir? Anyway, so there's a little bit of coal that I have for him and his stock.

Travis Hoium: Lou.

Lou Whiteman: I think I have the answer to that or a potential answer to that and that's because that's what he needs to do.

Travis Hoium: He's got to raise that next $100 million.

Lou Whiteman: Again he had the most success raising funds when Open AI was magic. He needs Open AI to be magic, whether it is or not. Look, I give him credit for doing what I think he has to do. Now, I don't know if that will end up working out for him, and I don't know. It's a tough thing. At the end of the day, I went to ChatGPT, and I found out that a pound of candy canes is worth 7-15 bucks. A pound of coal is worth about $0.15. Given the way Open AI needs money, I'm going to give him candy canes and not coal just so he can sell the things, need a little less money to raise. How about that?

Travis Hoium: Fair enough. Alright, let's go to someone who was in his final days officially as the CEO. Warren Buffett. Lou, you got to give him candy, right? This has been quite a run.

Lou Whiteman: But are we doing it for this year?

Travis Hoium: Well, let's do this year.

Lou Whiteman: Brian Nichol has had a great run, Travis. Here's the thing, who am I to question Warren Buffett and that sincerely, and I'm a shareholder. But if you look at this year and you look at the last few years, I do ask myself the question. If it was anyone other than Warren Buffett, what would we be thinking?

Travis Hoium: Outside of that Apple investment that they made about a decade ago, not a lot of great wins over the past decade.

Lou Whiteman: You can walk and chew gum at the same time. I get saving your investment capital for better markets I get that I agree with Warren. A lot of the markets, to me, have looked overvalued. I've still found ways to place stock. But they have, what, a third of $1 trillion in cash. I feel like you can deploy some of that and still have an ample reserve. I don't think they're going to deploy $350 billion into a Dow turn. I'm going to give him candy it's going to be See's candy, of course, it has to be. But I do think, and we can talk about Greg Abel, too, but I do think that man, the pressure is on because at some point, the benefit of the doubt of Oh, it's just I think if we took the label off this company and looked at their actions over this year and the last few years, I don't think there'd be a lot of people rushing to buy in.

Travis Hoium: Asit.

Asit Sharma: I'm going with 24 of those small candy canes. I want to give Warren the whole box. I think he deserves it. I think his message implicitly is, Hey, shareholders I gave you about a third of 1 trillion bucks on the balance sheet, cash. I gave you this amazing assemblage of operating companies. I present to you Greg Abel, who I have trained. I have built the culture that we needed. I've done many of these deals on handshakes, and I hope my successors can do the same when they acquire companies. We've been one of the most successful investment vehicles on Earth. I'm going out on top with no regrets. I still have my health. I'm still drinking one can of Coke or more every day. What more do you want? Give me the candy. [OVERLAPPING] I don't know how he has any insides left.

Travis Hoium: Alright. Quickly, Lou. Larry Ellison, candy or coal.

Lou Whiteman: I guess he needs to get candy because every son should have a father so supportive, if nothing else for that.

Travis Hoium: Hey, dad, I want to take over media.

Lou Whiteman: Larry has always been someone who knows the way the wind is blowing and who can position himself and I don't mean that as a backhanded compliment. It has worked out for him well. I think he has done that well this year. I know there's questions about Blue Owl. I know there's questions about everything right now. I'm not going to bet against Oracle coming out, if nothing worse than fine from this, too, just because Larry knows how to work the room.

Travis Hoium: Asit, quickly, what do you think about Larry Ellison in 2025?

Asit Sharma: I think Lou did such a great job of hitting his highlights. I want to give him a little bit of coal, an admirer of Larry Ellison, own some Oracle, have recommended it in a service. I just didn't like at the end of the year with all that debt, and I understand the argument that it's staggered out there. That they are just pitching more into a leveraged position and placing such a concentrated bet on their role in AI, which could be a great role their technology is amazing. It colored my view of Larry, but he's a wild guy he's an adventurous guy. We know that. He's always been this way, and so we see it manifest in his business dealings and the risks he takes.

We like to end the show by asking each channelist for a stock on their radar and get some questions from Dan Boyd behind the glass. Lou, you're up first. What's on your radar this week?

Lou Whiteman: Consulting giant Accenture, they released earnings this week. Numbers look pretty good to me. Revenue up 6% year over year, earnings per share up 10%, both top the Wall Street estimates. Look, investors have been down on consultants this year, worried that a tough economy would limit new business. Talk of AI replacing consultants in the future. But Accenture booked $21 billion in new business in the quarter a lot of that AI related, and 33 new clients. There are 33 clients with bookings greater than $100 million. Stock is down 23% for the year, Dan, I think that's a market overreaction. Accenture looks really interesting.

Travis Hoium: Dan, what do you think about Accenture?

Dan Boyd: Is there anything going for Accenture other than AI right now, Lou?

Lou Whiteman: Yeah. Oh, they do a lot of work that isn't AI. It's just AI is all anyone wants to talk about. Look, Dan, at the end of the day, if you're a CEO and you want to do a project, you hire Accenture just so you can blame them if it goes wrong. That's the bull case.

Travis Hoium: Asit, what's on your radar this week?

Asit Sharma: I'll make this short and sweet. I'm looking at Embraer. This is the Brazilian jet Maker symbol EMBJ. This is a business I wrote about 13 years ago, and the stock did nothing, but here we are. The aerospace industry has changed. Now the company has a tremendous backlog. It has a number one position in 76 Cedar plane the type of plane that I take when I have to fly from Raleigh to Washington. It also is a leader in the small and midsize business jet category. It's a business that's operating at pretty good margins for an aerospace manufacturer about 9%. Also, Embraer is really great for its maintenance services. It's getting a lot of incremental revenue from maintenance and repair.

Travis Hoium: Dan, what do you think about small jets?

Dan Boyd: I don't know anything about small jets, Travis. I am worried about investing in a small jet company. It seems like I don't need a small jet. I can't afford a small jet. Are people buying small jets?

Asit Sharma: Well, Dan, the bulk of their business, actually, you probably flown on an Embraer and didn't know it in a small market, but we understand from before the show, you don't fly to small cities you only fly to big cities.

Dan Boyd: No, Asit, I'm big time, Dan Boyd.

Travis Hoium: Alright, big time Dan Boyd, which stock is going on your watch list?

Dan Boyd: I don't know. Again, I'm getting big time Asit here, and I'm going to go with Accenture so sorry, jets.",https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F848698%2Fopenai-wants-another-100-billion.jpg&w=1200&op=resize,N,,2025-12-30 02:59:34.780564

ID32,Nvidia,2025-12-30 05:28:34+00:00,ctech,Nvidia in advanced talks to acquire AI21 in $2-3 billion deal focused on talent - CTech,"Sophie Shulman, Meir Orbach, Sophie Shulman, Meir Orbach",,,,,https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/rkbh00xnzl,"Chip giant Nvidia is in advanced talks to acquire AI21 Labs, one of the few Israeli startups developing a large-scale language model for artificial intelligence, Calcalist has learned.
According to estimates, the deal could be valued at $2-3 billion, up from AI21’s last known valuation of $1.4 billion, set during a fundraising round completed in 2023.
AI21 completed a $300 million fundraising round earlier this year led by Nvidia and Google.
Nvidia’s primary interest in AI21 appears to be its workforce of roughly 200 employees, most of whom hold advanced academic degrees and possess rare expertise in artificial intelligence development.
AAI focuses on what Shashua describes as the most forward-looking area of artificial intelligence: reasoning and “thinking” models, rather than conventional training and inference systems.","Chip giant Nvidia is in advanced talks to acquire AI21 Labs, one of the few Israeli startups developing a large-scale language model for artificial intelligence, Calcalist has learned. According to estimates, the deal could be valued at $2-3 billion, up from AI21’s last known valuation of $1.4 billion, set during a fundraising round completed in 2023.

AI21 completed a $300 million fundraising round earlier this year led by Nvidia and Google. The company never officially confirmed the round, however, and its valuation was not disclosed. Estimates at the time suggested that the valuation had not risen significantly compared with the 2023 round.

AI21 has long been considered “on the shelf,” with Google also previously exploring a potential acquisition. In recent weeks, however, talks with Nvidia have advanced significantly and have reached the most senior levels. Nvidia’s primary interest in AI21 appears to be its workforce of roughly 200 employees, most of whom hold advanced academic degrees and possess rare expertise in artificial intelligence development.

Such a transaction would effectively provide Nvidia with a fast-track expansion of its AI talent base in Israel, at an implied cost of roughly $10-15 million per employee. While this reflects strong international demand for Israeli AI talent, it also underscores a retreat from AI21’s original ambition to compete directly with leading AI model developers such as OpenAI or Anthropic.

If completed, the deal would resemble an acquihire, focused primarily on talent rather than technology. For Nvidia, this would mark its fourth significant acquisition in Israel and its second-largest after the $7 billion purchase of Mellanox. In 2023, Nvidia also acquired Deci and Run:ai for a combined $1 billion.

AI21 was founded in 2017 by Professor Amnon Shashua, Professor Yoav Shoham, and Ori Goshen, and was initially seen as a flagship effort to place Israel at the forefront of artificial intelligence, years before the generative AI boom that began in 2022. Shoham, a leading AI researcher at Stanford University, and Goshen serve as co-CEOs, while Shashua is chairman. Nvidia and Google first invested in AI21 in the company’s 2023 fundraising round, which was completed and later expanded during the war in Israel.

Over the past two years, however, AI21 has struggled to keep pace with the rapid advances of the industry’s leading players. In April, the company halted development of Wordtune, its long-running consumer-facing product for AI-assisted writing and reading. Today, AI21 focuses primarily on specialized language models aimed at enterprise customers, where accuracy and reliability are critical and the tolerance for error is far lower than in consumer applications.

The company’s flagship enterprise product, Maestro, is designed to improve language-model accuracy by up to 50%. In recent months, AI21 has also introduced a new reasoning model that it says is faster and more efficient than competing systems, reducing memory consumption. Despite these efforts, estimates suggest the company’s annual revenue remains modest, at around $50 million, far below the multibillion-dollar revenues generated by leading AI competitors.

Nvidia, meanwhile, is facing growing competitive pressure following advances in Google’s TPU chips, which are increasingly positioned as alternatives to Nvidia’s GPUs for AI workloads. Last weekend, Nvidia reportedly made a far larger move by acquiring the founder and staff of chip startup Groq for $20 billion, gaining access to technology developed by engineers who previously led Google’s TPU efforts.

An acquisition of AI21, relatively small by Nvidia’s standards, given its roughly $60 billion cash position, would further extend CEO Jensen Huang’s expansion strategy in Israel. Earlier this month, Nvidia announced plans to build a massive campus in Kiryat Tivon, expected to house up to 10,000 employees by 2031. Nvidia currently employs about 5,000 people in Israel, including roughly 3,000 in Yokneam, the former headquarters of Mellanox. The company also maintains large offices in Tel Aviv and plans to significantly expand its presence in Be’er Sheva.

For Shashua, a sale of AI21 would mark a more muted outcome compared with the $15 billion sale of Mobileye to Intel in 2016. At the same time, he is already deeply engaged in a new AI venture, AAI. The startup recently raised hundreds of millions of dollars in a funding round led by Lightspeed, achieving unicorn status less than two years after its founding.

AAI focuses on what Shashua describes as the most forward-looking area of artificial intelligence: reasoning and “thinking” models, rather than conventional training and inference systems. The company was founded by Shashua together with Professor Shai Shalev-Shwartz, who also serves as Mobileye’s chief technology officer, along with several former doctoral students and researchers from fields including computer science, mathematics, physics, and biology.

As Shashua has written, the company’s goal is “to bring about a new era of discovery by developing the code for superintelligence.”",https://pic1.calcalist.co.il/picserver3/crop_images/2025/12/29/SJuIgHxE11l/SJuIgHxE11l_56_1_981_552_0_large.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 02:59:30.593713

Can Société Générale deliver on its promised cost savings without eroding its revenue base?","Sentiment Sways as Strategy Reset Meets Market Reality

Société Générale S.A. is ending the year in a reflective mood rather than a euphoric one. After a strong rally through much of 2024, the French lender’s shares have slipped back over recent weeks as investors reassess a strategy reset that promises lower risk and cleaner capital, but also slower growth and a near?term earnings drag.

On the Paris exchange, Société Générale recently traded around EUR 24 per share, leaving the stock down over the past month but still comfortably above its lows for the year. Over the last five trading days the share price has moved broadly sideways, with intraday swings but no clear short?term trend. Stretch the lens to three months, and a gentle downward slope emerges as profit?taking and cautious guidance sap momentum.

The 52?week range tells the story of a stock that has already lived several market lives this year. On the downside, shares fell into the high?teens earlier in the year as investors digested a strategic reset and modest revenue targets. On the upside, they climbed into the low?30s at their peak, buoyed by rising rates, reassuring capital metrics and a broader European bank rally. Trading today, the stock sits in the lower half of that range, suggesting sentiment that is more skeptical than euphoric but far from capitulation.

Put together, the short?term consolidation, the three?month drift lower and the mid?range positioning on the 52?week spectrum add up to a cautiously bearish near?term tone. The market appears willing to give management time, but not the benefit of the doubt on earnings just yet.

Latest corporate updates and investor information on Société Générale S.A. in English

One-Year Investment Performance

For shareholders who placed their bet on Société Générale a year ago, the ride has been bumpy but ultimately rewarding. The stock closed at roughly EUR 21 per share around this time last year. Measured against the recent price near EUR 24, that translates into a gain of about 14 percent over twelve months.

On the surface, a mid?teens return in a mature European bank is hardly a disappointment, particularly given the periodic bouts of market anxiety over geopolitics, French fiscal risks and the future path of interest rates. Investors who held their nerve through volatility have seen Société Générale quietly outperform much of its own recent history, and they collected a dividend along the way that pushes the total return even higher.

Yet the journey has hardly been linear. The stock traded materially below today’s level at several points, and those who mistimed entries during the spring and early summer rally may feel more bruised than victorious. The fact that the share price is now well below the highs reached earlier this year underscores a lingering disconnect: the bank’s strengthened balance sheet and refocused portfolio are real achievements, but the market is still waiting for robust, visible earnings growth to match.

In that sense, today’s holders of Société Générale represent a specific breed of European bank investor: patient, value?oriented, more focused on capital, cost discipline and dividends than on blue?sky growth stories. The one?year performance validates that stance, but it also underlines how much further the bank still has to go to command a premium valuation.

Recent Catalysts and News

Earlier this week, attention turned again to Société Générale’s capital and funding profile as European banks navigated year?end regulatory and market scrutiny. The group’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio remains at the upper end of management’s target range, bolstered by disposals of non?core assets undertaken over the past two years. That strong capital position continues to act as a safety net for investors worried about macro shocks or potential regulatory tightening.

In recent days, the market also digested follow?up commentary from management on the bank’s ongoing restructuring and cost?cutting program, including the integration and streamlining of parts of its French retail network and adjustments within its investment banking and markets franchises. Executives reiterated their commitment to structurally lower the group’s breakeven point and to refocus on more stable, fee?generating activities, particularly in financing and transaction services. However, they also acknowledged that transformation costs and the drag from businesses slated for reshaping will continue to weigh on the near?term profit and loss account.

News flow earlier this month around the macro backdrop did little to brighten sentiment. A softer outlook for euro?area growth and a shift in expectations toward rate cuts from the European Central Bank in the coming year raise questions about how much further banks can rely on net interest income tailwinds. For Société Générale, which has already guided conservatively on revenue growth, those macro uncertainties reinforce the sense that the next leg of performance must come from execution on costs and capital allocation rather than from a benign rate environment alone.

On the strategic front, the group has continued to communicate progress on simplifying its geographic footprint and product mix, including the sale or wind?down of selected operations outside its core markets and the ongoing refinement of its corporate and investment banking franchise. Investors generally welcome the focus, but they are also keenly aware that disposals can dilute earnings in the short term even as they de?risk the balance sheet.

Wall Street Verdict & Price Targets

Brokerage research published over the past month paints a nuanced picture of how the analyst community views Société Générale at this stage of its turnaround. The consensus rating hovers around a ""Hold"" or ""Neutral"", with a slight tilt toward positive among European bank specialists who see value in the shares at current levels.

Several major investment banks have reiterated price targets that sit meaningfully above the current quote, implying double?digit upside if the bank delivers on its mid?term targets. Recent reports from large international houses place their 12?month price objectives in a broad band between roughly EUR 28 and EUR 32 per share. Those targets effectively assume that return on tangible equity nudges higher, the cost base shrinks as promised and credit quality remains manageable despite a weakening macro backdrop.

Yet the language in these notes is hardly exuberant. Analysts at global firms stress that Société Générale remains a ""show?me"" story. They point to the bank’s checkered track record over the past decade – marked by restructuring charges, legacy litigation and complex portfolios – as a reason why investors demand an extra margin of safety. A number of houses explicitly frame their rating as ""Hold"" because they want more evidence of sustained earnings delivery before recommending a more aggressive stance.

On the downside, only a minority of brokers maintain outright ""Sell"" ratings, typically citing concerns about revenue pressure in French retail banking, execution risk in the investment bank, or the possibility that management could prioritize capital buffers over shareholder returns in a more stressed scenario. Their price targets cluster closer to the low?20s, essentially in line with or modestly below the prevailing market price.

The takeaway is a divided but not polarized sell?side community: upside is acknowledged, but the conviction to label Société Générale a clear ""Buy"" remains limited until the bank proves that its reset is more than just a balance sheet clean?up.

Future Prospects and Strategy

Looking ahead, Société Générale’s future will be defined less by dramatic strategic pivots and more by disciplined execution on a plan that has already been broadly outlined. At its core, the bank is trying to become a simpler, more capital?efficient institution with a higher proportion of stable, recurring revenues and a reduced appetite for complex, capital?consuming activities.

In retail and commercial banking, the focus is on deepening relationships in its core markets, particularly France, while accelerating the shift to digital channels. Simplifying branch networks, rationalizing overlapping brands and investing in improved mobile and online offerings are all meant to lower structural costs and lock in customer loyalty. The risk, of course, is that cost?cutting undermines service quality if not carefully managed – a tension that management will need to navigate deftly.

In corporate and investment banking, Société Générale is leaning into areas where it believes it can compete effectively without stretching the balance sheet: structured financing, trade and transaction banking, and selected capital markets activities, particularly in equity derivatives where it has long?standing expertise. The challenge is to maintain leading franchises while exiting or trimming less profitable or more volatile product lines. If done well, this could yield a more resilient earnings profile with lower volatility across the cycle.

Capital allocation remains a central pillar of the story. With a CET1 ratio above regulatory minima and additional capital to be freed as disposals close, the bank has scope to support a stable or gradually rising dividend and, potentially, selective share buybacks. Yet management has signalled that prudence will trump aggressiveness: in a world of uncertain growth, geopolitical shocks and evolving regulation, holding a thicker capital cushion is seen as a competitive advantage, not an inefficient drag.

For investors, the key questions over the coming quarters are straightforward but demanding. Can Société Générale deliver on its promised cost savings without eroding its revenue base? Will a softer rate environment and slower growth eat into margins faster than efficiency gains can offset? And can the bank maintain its improved risk profile if credit conditions deteriorate from today’s benign starting point?

If the answers are broadly positive, today’s valuation – still at a discount to many European peers on metrics such as price?to?book and price?to?earnings – could look unduly pessimistic in hindsight. A steady improvement in return on tangible equity, backed by visible capital returns and an absence of negative surprises, would give the market reason to re?rate the stock closer to the mid?range of recent analyst targets.

If, however, execution falters or the macro environment turns decisively against the sector, Société Générale’s shares may remain trapped in their current band, offering income and modest value but little in the way of rerating. For now, investors are watching a bank in mid?transition, weighing a repaired balance sheet and clearer strategic focus against memories of past missteps and an earnings trajectory that still has to prove its resilience. The next year will show whether this French lender can finally convert structural repair into sustained shareholder rewards.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405043_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-12-30 02:12:48.757258

S&P Global’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for Russian manufacturing fell to 48.1 in December compared to 48.3 last month. A PMI value above 50 points indicates growth, whereas anything below signifies a decline.

Companies reported declines in both output and new orders, with production falling at its fastest pace since March 2022, S&P Global said.

Respondents attributed weaker sales to cautious customers and falling purchasing power.

Expectations for the year ahead slid to their lowest level since May 2022, prompting companies to cut employment again and reduce purchasing activity amid worsening outlooks, the survey said.

Input costs rose at their fastest pace since March, with firms passing on higher expenses to customers by raising prices.

Dmitry Belousov of the Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting (CMASF) said that company managers have not expressed such persistently negative sentiment since the Covid-19 pandemic.

Official industrial output data for December have not yet been released.

November figures showed a 1.5% month-on-month decline after seasonal adjustment as well as a 0.7% year-on-year decrease.

A temporary uptick in October proved short-lived, with output in September-November rising only 0.2% per month on average, CMASF said.

Recent fluctuations have largely been driven by sectors with significant defense-industry involvement, while output in the civilian core of manufacturing has stagnated for the past four months, CMASF said.

Even President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged emerging “imbalances” in the economy, with output falling in several industries.

Vladimir Potanin, one of Russia’s wealthiest businessmen and co-owner of mining giant Norilsk Nickel, described the current period as a test of business resilience.

“Right now, we are going through a period of... I don't want to use the word ‘survival,’ but a period when businesses are really being tested, when entire industries are being tested for viability,” Potanin said.

Experts at the Gaidar Institute highlighted sustained growth in pharmaceuticals and aircraft and transport equipment production in contrast with declines in machinery, automotive manufacturing and building materials.

The institute expects this divergence to persist, with growth concentrated in sectors tied to state orders and import substitution, while consumer-oriented and credit-dependent industries continue to shrink.

The Central Bank meanwhile has downplayed the risks of a recession.

“While we do see a mixed picture across industries, the economy overall continues to grow,” said Andrei Gangan, director of the Bank's monetary policy department. “Not at the rates of previous years, but we do not expect any negative growth this year or in the years ahead.”

The Central Bank’s own enterprise monitoring paints a more upbeat picture, showing continued growth in business activity, including in manufacturing.

Economist Dmitry Polevoy said the discrepancy with S&P Global’s findings may stem from differences in survey samples, noting that the U.S. survey probably does not cover defense-related enterprises.

This potential tie-up comes just months after OpenAI restructured its corporate model and freed itself from exclusive compute obligations to Microsoft, one of its earliest and largest backers. For marketers watching the generative AI space, the move hints at a broader shift: the rise of circular deals between hyperscalers and AI companies, where compute, chips, and cash are traded in mutually reinforcing loops.

What marketers should know

Amazon is reportedly eyeing OpenAI

Amazon is in confidential talks to invest up to US$10 billion into OpenAI, according to The Information and confirmed by CNBC. While still fluid, the deal would mirror previous cloud-chip alliances forming across the generative AI industry.

Under the rumored agreement, OpenAI would use Amazon’s Trainium and Inferentia chips, purpose-built hardware for training and deploying large language models. This complements a US$38 billion compute deal the two companies signed last month, making Amazon Web Services (AWS) a formal OpenAI cloud partner for the first time.

Amazon has already committed US$8 billion to Anthropic, OpenAI’s closest competitor, and unveiled its next-generation Trainium chips in early December. The company is aggressively positioning itself as an infrastructure provider to AI companies, leveraging both cloud capacity and in-house semiconductors.

Meanwhile, OpenAI has secured over US$1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments in recent months, including partnerships with AMD, Nvidia, and Broadcom. It also invested in CoreWeave earlier this year, a move that helped the GPU provider scale up while indirectly boosting OpenAI’s own access to compute.

Why this kind of deal is becoming standard

The potential Amazon-OpenAI deal reflects a growing trend in AI: circular deals between tech giants and AI startups. In these arrangements, big cloud providers or chipmakers invest in fast-growing AI firms, which in turn agree to use the investor’s infrastructure.

This model helps both parties. Cloud platforms get guaranteed long-term customers, and AI companies get compute at scale, often at preferential terms. It is a win-win on paper, but also raises questions about market concentration and lock-in.

We have already seen this with:

OpenAI investing US$350 million into CoreWeave, which then bought Nvidia chips to support OpenAI’s compute needs

A 10% stake in AMD, along with chip usage commitments

Amazon’s separate bet on Anthropic, and Microsoft’s earlier US$13 billion investment into OpenAI

As these deals stack up, they effectively turn hardware and infrastructure providers into kingmakers, controlling who gets to scale and how fast.

What marketers should know

Marketers may not be trading chips or cloud credits, but these moves affect the future of AI tools and services they rely on. Here’s how:

1. AI stack consolidation could affect tool diversity

As AI companies partner more deeply with cloud or chip providers, expect tools built on the same infrastructure. That could mean similar capabilities, limitations, and even biases. For marketers, this may reduce differentiation across platforms.

2. Pricing wars and performance gains ahead

Chip-backed deals often come with cost advantages. If OpenAI gets cheaper or faster compute via Trainium, its API pricing or feature set may evolve. This could impact the platforms marketers use, such as ChatGPT or tools built on its APIs.

3. Greater risk of cloud-aligned silos

As Amazon, Microsoft, and Google double down on exclusive AI partnerships, tools may start optimizing only for certain platforms. Marketers should track which cloud ecosystem their preferred vendors are aligned with.

4. Strategic alignment is key

Now more than ever, marketers need to ask who is building the AI tools they use, and whose infrastructure those tools are tied to. Understanding these dynamics will help anticipate performance, ethics, and reliability questions down the line.

A US$10 billion Amazon investment in OpenAI would be one of the largest circular AI deals to date. It signals that AI infrastructure is no longer just about chips or cloud, but about power and positioning.

For marketers, the takeaway is clear. Watch where the AI money flows, because it will shape the tools, platforms, and performance benchmarks you will depend on in the years to come.",https://www.contentgrip.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/12/Amazon-may-invest-US-10B-in-OpenAI.webp,N,,2025-12-29 21:58:36.383335

This strategic partnership aims to bolster Intel's struggling market position by leveraging its manufacturing capabilities for custom x86 CPUs and PC chips. The deal signifies a crucial step in Intel's turnaround, offering much-needed capital and industry validation.

Nvidia closed its $5 billion investment in Intel on December 26, acquiring 214.8 million shares at $23.28 each—36% below Intel's trading price at the time of announcement. The transaction, cleared by the Federal Trade Commission earlier this month, marks a pivotal moment for Intel as it battles to reverse years of declining market dominance and financial strain.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Intel and Nvidia’s partnership goes beyond cash infusion

The partnership extends far beyond financial backing. Intel will design and manufacture custom x86 CPUs tailored for Nvidia's AI server platforms, positioning them alongside Nvidia's own Grace processors.The companies also plan PC chips that marry Intel CPU cores with Nvidia RTX graphics chiplets via NVLink interconnect technology. Back in SeptemberC Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the partnership a ""historic collaboration,” while Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan emphasized how the deal validates Intel's x86 architecture and manufacturing prowess. The arrangement offers Nvidia smoother entry into enterprise x86 systems without forcing customers to abandon existing software infrastructure. Intel's desperation is quantifiable: its data center market share collapsed from 70% in 2021 to just 7% last quarter as Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing surged ahead. The company has hemorrhaged both technological leadership and investor confidence over years of execution failures.Critically, neither company has committed to moving Nvidia's crown-jewel GPU production from TSMC to Intel's contract manufacturing—suggesting this remains primarily a strategic alliance rather than a foundry partnership. For Intel, however, the Nvidia stamp of approval offers something nearly as valuable as cash: proof that the industry's dominant player still sees potential in Intel's turnaround story.

Mark Johnson was born on January 31, 1943, in Winona, Minnesota, to Joseph and Elaine (Donahue) Johnson. He graduated from Sacred Heart Catholic High School in Waseca, Minnesota, in 1962. On June 29, 1963, Mark was united in marriage to Janet A. Turnacliff.

Mark began his career in Beaver Dam at Herter’s Sporting Goods, where he served as manager for 17 years. After the store closed, he worked at Chrysler in Beaver Dam for another 17 years, later retiring from Advanced Products after eight years of service.

Mark was active throughout his life. He played softball into his 50s and had a deep appreciation for the outdoors, especially snowmobiling. Mark looked forward to arranging the annual snowmobile party and finding ways to make it an enjoyable event for everyone. He served as president of the Beaver Dam Conservation Club for six years and was a lifetime member. Mark was a devoted father and grandfather. As soon as his sons turned seven, they were old enough to partake in the annual trip to Canada, where they enjoyed fishing and roughing it in the outdoors. Mark rarely missed one of his grandchildren’s sporting events or other activities, cheering them on with pride. In his later years, he took up golf and spent many enjoyable hours at Beaver Dam Country Club. Mark was a fan of many Wisconsin sports, except when it came to football; he will always be a loyal Viking’s fan. Mark’s charming personality and his quick wit and humor will be missed by all who knew him.

The decisions they made spotlight where these advertising operations fall into larger strategic and business plans.

Priorities can vary across large retailers, as companies try to find the right mix for boosting sales of products they carry and — in many cases — bringing in third-party advertisers that sell through other ecommerce sites.

In the meantime, technology and tools received updates. Artificial intelligence (AI) played a significant role, especially when it came to new campaign optimization options. As grocers, such as Albertsons and Kroger, and mass merchants, including Costco and Sam’s Club, updated their offerings, all were focused on improving ad relevance across a variety of display contexts.

All the while, new partnerships were reshaping agreements behind the scenes. Even though they do not appear in this recap, Amazon’s Netflix deal to bring the streamer’s ad inventory to Amazon Ads customers and Google’s deal to access Criteo’s retail media inventory made waves as well.

Major indices headed south on Monday, even as many investors were still away for the holidays, and with just a few sessions left in 2025, attention has now started to turn to whether or not Wall Street will be able to maintain its late‑year footing and extend the positive run that has characterised much of December into 2026.

On the macro front, US pending home sales unexpectedly surged in November, according to the National Association of Realtors, hitting the highest level since February 2023. Based on signed contracts, pending home sales rose 3.3% month-on-month, better than expectations for a softer 1% increase and October's upwardly revised 2.4% gain. On an annualised basis, pending home sales were up 2.6%.

Elsewhere, the Dallas Federal Reserve's manufacturing index decreased to -10.90 in December, down from -10.40 in November to its lowest level since June.

No major corporate earnings were released on Monday.

The report, citing data from Pitchbook, shows that this year’s funding levels surpassed the previous record of $92 billion set in 2021, with companies like OpenAI and Anthropic attracting strong interest from investors.

Venture capitalists and industry experts told the FT that this funding will fuel growth while also offering companies a cushion in case there’s an investment downturn caused by worries about heavy spending on AI infrastructure.

“You should make hay while the sun is shining,” said Lucas Swisher, a partner at Coatue who has invested in OpenAI, Databricks and SpaceX. “2026 might bring something unexpected . . . when the market is providing the option, build a fortress balance sheet.”

Funding levels for 2025 have been elevated by some record rounds, the FT said: $41 billion for OpenAI, $13 billion for Anthropic, and Meta’s $14 billion bet on data-labelling start-up Scale AI.

The report adds that cost pressures have led to more frequent funding rounds, particularly for companies working on “frontier” AI models that require massive amounts of computing power and costly chips.

OpenAI’s revenues for this year are about $13 billion, sources close to the company told the FT. However, the startup is losing billions of dollars each year as it develops its models, products and infrastructure.

In other AI news, PYMNTS spoke Monday with Adam Hiatt, vice president of fraud strategy at payments orchestration platform Spreedly, about the role of the technology in preventing fraud.

Although AI has rightfully gotten lots of attention for the part it has played in democratizing fraud, the report said, fraudsters don’t have a monopoly on artificial intelligence.

All the same, the advent of AI and its applications across popular and increasingly industrialized fraud schemes have compressed timelines and raised the level of abstraction at which humans must operate, that report added.

“Distinguishing between the good and the bad is turning into something that even good manual review isn’t able to do,” Hiatt said. “It used to be you could throw people at the problem, but that’s becoming tougher.”",https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/This-Week-in-AI-funding-investments.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 21:58:40.165167

“With unlimited resources, failed attempts are simply followed by more attempts.” Simon suggested Uber devote its litigation spending to efforts designed to improve driver safety.
Yarus, Uber asserts, completed more than 1,200 exams for Simon & Simon over a three-year period, in exchange for $1.5 million.
Simon & Simon voluntarily dismissed the company from the cases before any had concluded.
Simon & Simon dropped Uber from nearly 30 cases after its legal team sought to subpoena Burt for a deposition earlier this year, company officials said.","Uber is planning to amend its racketeering lawsuit against a Philadelphia attorney the rideshare company alleges conspired with medical providers in an attempt to turn minor crashes into million-dollar paydays.

The move to refile the complaint came after Simon & Simon PC – the firm directing the supposed scheme – asked a federal judge to dismiss the case, which its legal team characterized as “outrageous, shameful, and a gross departure from civility in the profession.”

""Uber's approach to silencing injured victims and their lawyers is clear: act first, don’t worry if it’s true or not,” said Marc I. Simon, who founded the law practice in 2010, in a statement. “With unlimited resources, failed attempts are simply followed by more attempts.”

Simon suggested Uber devote its litigation spending to efforts designed to improve driver safety. In comments earlier this month, he said the lawsuit, alongside similar complaints filed against firms across the country, is a strategy to ""intimidate injured victims and bully their lawyers.”

An Uber spokesperson told Metro that the Simon & Simon motion to dismiss offers “no real response to the detailed and credible allegations of fraudulent conduct in our RICO complaint” and instead focuses on “unpersuasive technical arguments about where, how, and by whom they could be sued.""

“We are confident in the merits of our case and look forward to seeing the defendants in court,” the spokesperson added, in a statement.

Representatives from the company did not respond when asked why Uber intends to alter its initial lawsuit.

Its lawyers notified the court Dec. 22 that an amended complaint would be forthcoming. U.S. District Court Judge Mark Kearney, in a subsequent order, said he expects the new filing will ""address the alleged pleading deficiencies” following a meeting between the sides. The amendment must be submitted no later than Jan. 12.

Uber, in the original lawsuit, filed in September, claimed that Simon & Simon funneled clients to Dr. Clifton Burt, of Premier Pain & Rehab Center, and chiropractors Ethel Harvey and Daniel Piccillo, both of Philadelphia Spine Associates LLC. All three were named as defendants in the case.

The law firm scheduled patients' visits in bulk for Burt, who allegedly prescribed bogus treatments, according to Uber.

Using fraudulent paperwork from Burt and the chiropractors, another doctor and defendant, Lance Yarus, would develop a report concluding that the person needs a lifetime of ongoing care due to the crash, the rideshare company claimed.

Yarus, Uber asserts, completed more than 1,200 exams for Simon & Simon over a three-year period, in exchange for $1.5 million.

Attorneys for Simon & Simon issued a sharp rebuke in their Dec. 12 motion to dismiss: “Disguised as a lawsuit, which is utterly baseless, this proceeding is in reality a business tactic – and a particularly ugly and vicious one at that – to suppress lawsuits arising from careless Uber drivers.”

The Simon team argued that Uber is trying to relitigate a batch of state-level personal injury cases in federal court. Of the 18 lawsuits cited in the company’s complaint, nine have been settled; four are pending; three have been decided in favor of the plaintiff; a jury or judge sided with the defense once; and another case was dismissed, according to Simon & Simon.

None of the payouts came from Uber or its insurance carrier, the law firm noted. Simon & Simon voluntarily dismissed the company from the cases before any had concluded.

But Uber has described the decision as a cover-up. Simon & Simon dropped Uber from nearly 30 cases after its legal team sought to subpoena Burt for a deposition earlier this year, company officials said.

Simon’s counsel believes the rideshare giant targeted him because of two recent sanctions against his firm in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, involving non-Uber cases.

Uber has filed similar complaints in recent months against law firms based in New York, Los Angeles and Miami under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act.

Though most well-known as a tool for tackling organized crime, the RICO statute has a civil provision that allows the court to dissolve an enterprise; implement restrictions certain individuals; and order triple the typical amount of damages.

Company officials have said the rideshare corporation’s insurance policy limits are higher than almost any other vehicle on the road, creating an incentive for personal injury lawyers to sue. The resulting litigation and rising insurance costs, Uber says, is driving up prices for customers.",https://gamma.creativecirclecdn.com/omglocal/original/20251016-152513-b9e-2021-05-11t153735z_2_lynxmpeh4a10t_rtroptp_4_health-coronavirus-uber-lyft-focus-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 18:14:22.237482

In a recent post on X, CEO Sam Altman pointed out that AI models are starting to present ""real challenges,"" highlighting their growing knack for exposing critical security flaws in computers and their potential effects on users' mental well-being.

The position, dubbed Head of Preparedness, will oversee the implementation of OpenAI's preparedness framework, aimed at pinpointing and addressing risks that come with cutting-edge AI technologies that could lead to significant harm.

The job listing outlines responsibilities that involve keeping an eye on threats like cybersecurity issues, biological misuse, and increasingly autonomous systems that might be able to enhance themselves.

The salary for this role is set at $555,000, plus equity incentives.

However, there have been some shifts in leadership, including moving the former Head of Preparedness to a position focused on AI reasoning.

This renewed effort in hiring comes as generative AI is under increased scrutiny, especially regarding its impact on mental health.

There have been lawsuits claiming that AI chatbots have caused emotional distress, a concern that OpenAI says it's actively trying to address by enhancing safeguards and support systems for users.

As part of the transaction, J&J gains access to a once-daily oral therapy in development for prostate cancer, HLD-0915. It also takes on several experimental drugs for breast, lung and other types of tumors.

J&J Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman for Innovative Medicine Jennifer Taubert described the acquisition as a “strategic milestone.” She said it underscores the company’s “commitment to redefining cancer treatment with breakthrough science and transformative medicines.”

“We are excited to formally welcome the talented Halda team to Johnson & Johnson and look forward to working together to achieve our shared goal of eliminating cancer,” she said.

John Reed is executive vice president of innovative medicine and R&D for J&J. “Johnson & Johnson continuously seeks new ways to meet patient needs and deliver innovative therapies,” he added.

Reed went on to say that the company can now focus on “advancing the potential of this promising pipeline of novel product candidates” as well as harnessing Halda’s platform “to discover more molecules in oncology and beyond.”

The announcement follows J&J’s $14.6 billion acquisition of Bedminster-based neurological drugmaker Intra-Cellular Therapies in April.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2024/07/Cover-Image-070824.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 17:59:34.101657

Well, 2025 did pretty well. There was a relatively strong momentum in spite of consumer confidence levels. Even through the holiday season, we saw stronger than expected numbers. There were a number of estimates that suggested that retail sales would be in the low single digits. Um, some players even thought it would be negative. It ended up being in the mid-single digits around the 4% um, gain range, and even higher than that for e-commerce. Um, so the momentum of retail has been strong in 2025. The big question is what happens in 2026, um, because there is just so much uncertainty with the economy, with interest rates, um, and of course with consumer confidence continuing to go down.

And let's talk about Walmart and some of the other uh big retailers that are getting new CEOs, Target as well, and I don't know if these are on your coverage list, but I'm just going to list them because they're in the news as well. Camping World, Craft Heinz, Kohl's, Lulu Lemon, 7-Eleven, uh and it seems like changes in the air. So talk to us more specifically about Walmart and Target, please.

Well, Target has struggled a lot in the last few years and I am not entirely confident that um new leadership is going to write that ship. There are a number of operational and executional issues that they need to address. Walmart on the other hand has been on a roll. They have been doing incredibly well for several years. They gained share through the pandemic and continue to hold on to that share. They've invested heavily um both in their physical store experience, which is of course still the majority of their sales and they also have managed to continue to take share even in the dotcom and e-commerce sector. So those are things that are absolutely in Walmart's favor. Um and it's uh the new CEO of Walmart um likely is uh has a has a hard task ahead of them because they because the company has um has been doing so well to continue to grow on top of that is not going to be particularly easy. But that said, um if there is an economic downturn and if consumers do cut back on spending in 2026, these mass merchants like Walmart and Costco are likely to be beneficiaries.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SshzM0SV2fEPuPrvHMMdyQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/caaa3080-e4da-11f0-a7ff-64486baa1f62,N,,2025-12-29 17:00:03.205801

You can redesign the process end-to-end and embed AI, GenAI (generative AI), and agentic AI.
BPO providers need to invest heavily in agentic AI and those are the ones that will survive,” said Saurabh Gupta, president, research and advisory, HfS Research.
Many BPM companies have moved on to providing process optimisation and are delivering end-to-end solutions on process transformation rather than process management services.
Companies such as Genpact have launched “account payables as an agent”, decoupling from traditional services and focusing more on expertise, innovation, and outcome-driven solutions.","Yet, even as many agreed with this prediction, the sector delivered one of its biggest surprises in years: Capgemini’s $3.3 billion acquisition of WNS. The deal has forced a rethink of the future of business process management (BPM) — not as a low-margin, labour-heavy adjunct to information-technology (IT) services but as a business being repositioned for an AI-led operating model.

Explaining the rationale behind the acquisition, Capgemini Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Aiman Ezzat said BPM remained one of the fastest-growing segments.

“It is interesting to see that a business many assumed would eventually die is the one growing the fastest,” Ezzat said in an interaction with Business Standard. “For us the big opportunity lies in the complete transformation of end-to-end processes. For instance, take the claims process in insurance. You can redesign the process end-to-end and embed AI, GenAI (generative AI), and agentic AI. Such a transformation is complex and requires defining processes at a granular level. WNS gives us that capability,” said Ezzat.

The year 2026 is a year when the industry crosses the threshold from traditional BPM to intelligent operations powered by AI and driven by humans in the loop.

For decades, this industry — just like IT companies — depended on headcount–based delivery, fixed pricing models, and labour-intensive operations. But the impact of AI and GenAI is changing that play.

“This industry will look different in the next two years. BPO providers need to invest heavily in agentic AI and those are the ones that will survive,” said Saurabh Gupta, president, research and advisory, HfS Research.

“They have to reinvent themselves with technology providers coming into the BPO space as well. CommoditiSed BPOs will be hit the hardest and the ones that provide contextual services tailored to the needs of customers will survive.”

The BPM industry, worth $54.6 billion in 2024-25, according to the Nasscom data, continues to count the United States as its largest market, which is contributing about half its top line, with Europe adding another 30 per cent.

Banking financial services and insurance (BFSI) provides about 30 per cent of the revenue while hospitality and telecom contribute about 20 per cent each.

While the industry last year grew 4.7 per cent, its trajectory will depend solely on how fast it is able to adapt to the new technology. Many BPM companies have moved on to providing process optimisation and are delivering end-to-end solutions on process transformation rather than process management services. They are also moving beyond traditional pricing models to outcome-based pricing, often adopting a hybrid model depending on the specifics of each engagement.

“This transition is reshaping work. As workflows become more autonomous and data-rich, people will move into higher-order roles that demand judgement, orchestration, and strategic decision making, unlocking a level of performance previously out of reach. At industry level, this will accelerate consolidation because only organisations with true scale, deep domain depth, and strong platforms will be capable of leading the AI-enabled Digital BPS market,” said Keshav Murugesh, group CEO, WNS.

This shift is visible in how BPM firms are redesigning their offers. Companies such as Genpact have launched “account payables as an agent”, decoupling from traditional services and focusing more on expertise, innovation, and outcome-driven solutions. Such moves may cannibalise their existing revenue but analysts say they need to adopt it to be an agentic company rather than a pure-play BPO.

“These agentic solutions are taking hold with new clients who are net new to Genpact or are net new to that particular agentic solution,” Genpact CEO Balkrishnan Kalra said in a call with analysts in November.

This means traditional BPOs, which will continue to provide legacy services in finance and accounting, payroll management, contact centre, and supply-chain management, need to reinvent or get acquired because clients would not be ready to pay for the huge workforce.

Gaurav Vasu, founder of UnearthInsights, said: “Pure-play BPOs will find it hard to survive. We will see technology plus people plus industry domains come in and they will provide the business capability.”",https://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2025-05/13/full/1747153926-986.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 16:00:30.395180

Shimla: A week-long healthcare crisis in Himachal Pradesh has eased after the state govt agreed to review the sacking of a senior resident for assaulting a patient, prompting hundreds of striking doctors to return to their wards. Chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu intervened to end the deadlock on Monday, signalling a conciliatory shift by promising a fresh inquiry into the dismissal of Dr Raghav Nirula following a Dec 22 incident at Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC). The CM announced the formation of a specialised committee to re-examine the disciplinary action, which had initially resulted in the immediate termination of Dr Nirula's service and residency.

Sukhu told reporters: ""Our govt is not here to destroy anyone's career. Any punishment has a defined time period, and the doctor has shown remorse. We will constitute a new committee to review both matters and act based on their report."" The committee is tasked with two specific objectives — reviewing the permanent termination of service, while also reviewing the cancellation of the senior residency. The strike had significantly disrupted medical services across the state as resident doctors rallied behind their colleague, demanding a more transparent disciplinary process. Sukhu expressed satisfaction that the medical community had respected a request from the govt to resume work while the review takes place. He noted that while the initial dismissal was based on an internal IGMC report, the new committee would take a more ""sympathetic"" approach to the doctors' concerns. The CM said: ""When someone shows such respect [by returning to work], the govt will certainly give due consideration to their sentiments."" The new committee is expected to submit its findings shortly. Govt officials stated that final administrative actions regarding Dr Nirula's status will be dictated by the committee's recommendations. For now, hospitals across the state have returned to full capacity.

It's really only Alphabet and Nvidia, maybe Tesla as a come behind story that have really surged this year. So is it a game of have and have nots or how do you see this playing out?

No, it's a great question. I mean, look, I think Nvidia obviously continues to do well, but I also am certain that Nvidia is going to heck get a heck of a lot more competition in 2026. AMD is, you know, an obvious one, but there's a lot of other little players. I mean, you know, Nvidia's uh deal with Grock recently to bring more of their technology in is a reflection of the fact that we're seeing more specialized types of models being developed. We're we're going from the days of big general purpose LLMs that you can use for everything to much more specialized areas. And each of those are going to require different types of hardware and I think in turn that's going to create additional opportunities, but it's going to create more diversity, which is going to be a little harder to figure out. But obviously I think, you know, you're going to continue to see folks like Nvidia and AMD do well. I do, as I said, I think you're going to start to see uh some of the smaller the cloud guys who are doing custom chips often through Broadcom will also start to benefit. We've seen already, you know, Google's been doing more with TPUs, uh Amazon has their Graviton chips. Um, we've got a a bunch of other companies. Microsoft is doing custom chips. A lot of these are arm-based. So arm is another company, you know, we haven't been talking about them a lot lately, but arm's helping drive some of this innovation. Intel, as you've talked about, you know, is doing well. They continue to plug away. Obviously, they had their challenges last year, but things are looking better in 2026. So, I think we're going to see a lot of different players uh from different areas uh all start to come together. And we'll see some smaller companies. Uh there's a little company called SiTime that does uh timing chips and all these networks have to be completely aligned from a timing perspective. They're doing some interesting stuff. So, I think there's a lot of different opportunities in different areas. Um but we're going to have a lot of the bears on the side just again, waiting to pounce on these oper these concerns that get raised, I think around a gentic AI.

And we'll have to see if those are dips worth buying or not. And Bob, what I'm realizing is we got to do another podcast real soon. So thank you for showing up.

The approval was supported by a single-arm clinical study on 28 adult patients and an expanded access program that included 221 adult and pediatric patients, both enrolling high-risk TA-TMA patients.
Per management, the FDA approval of YARTEMLEA is a major achievement for the company and a significant step forward for patients and families affected by TA-TMA.
As the first approved treatment for TA-TMA, YARTEMLEA represents a life-saving standard treatment for children aged two and older undergoing stem cell transplants.
Industry Prospects Favoring the Stem Cell Therapy Market Going by data provided by Precedence Research, the stem cell therapy market is valued at $6.75 billion in 2025 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 12.6% through 2034.","Omeros Corporation OMER recently announced that the FDA approved its YARTEMLEA (narsoplimab-wuug) to treat hematopoietic stem cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA), a frequent life-threatening condition that can occur after stem cell transplants. YARTEMLEA is approved for adults and pediatric patients aged two years and older and is the first and only therapy indicated for TA-TMA.

YARTEMLEA works by blocking MASP-2, the key enzyme of the lectin complement pathway, preventing pathway activation while keeping other important immune defense pathways intact. The approval was supported by a single-arm clinical study on 28 adult patients and an expanded access program that included 221 adult and pediatric patients, both enrolling high-risk TA-TMA patients.

Per management, the FDA approval of YARTEMLEA is a major achievement for the company and a significant step forward for patients and families affected by TA-TMA. After years of work with the transplant community, OMER is committed to delivering YARTEMLEA, the first FDA-approved treatment for this fatal condition, supported by strong clinical results and a favorable safety profile for both adults and children in the United States in January 2026.

OMER Stock Trend Following the News

Shares of Omeros have gained 2.3% since the announcement on Wednesday. Over the past six months, shares of the company have skyrocketed 423.7% compared with the industry’s 1.3% growth and the S&P 500’s 14.5% rise.

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

In the long run, FDA approval of YARTEMLEA represents a transformative milestone for Omeros as its first commercial product, shifting the company from a development-stage to a revenue-generating organization. A successful launch in the United States, and potentially in Europe, combined with the reimbursement codes already in place, would provide OMER with steady revenues, a platform for potential expansion and further strengthen its position as a commercial biotechnology company.

OMER currently has a market capitalization of $1.11 billion.

More on YARTEMLEA Approval

In the TA-TMA study, among patients treated with YARTEMLEA, 61% showed a complete response, meaning better lab results along with improved organ function or no longer needing transfusions. In the expanded access program, the complete response reached 68%. YARTEMLEA treatment was associated with an improved survival rate in high-risk TA-TMA patients. About 73% of patients in the main study and 74% in the expanded access program were alive 100 days after diagnosis, a significant improvement in historical outcomes in high-risk TA-TMA.

As the first approved treatment for TA-TMA, YARTEMLEA represents a life-saving standard treatment for children aged two and older undergoing stem cell transplants. The clinical data show that Narsoplimab provides strong response rates and better survival, with an acceptable safety profile. The company has already secured the necessary billing and reimbursement codes. These include a specific diagnosis code for TA-TMA and procedure codes that cover how YARTEMLEA is given through either a peripheral or central vein.

The approval of YARTEMLEA strengthens OMER’s position in the biotech and rare-disease sector. It establishes the company as a leader in the treatment of TA-TMA, a life-threatening condition of stem cell transplants, giving the company a first-mover advantage in the critical orphan indications market. With a European regulatory decision expected in mid-2026, OMER aims to gain market visibility and strengthen its longer-term pipeline credibility by validating its complement-pathway expertise.

Industry Prospects Favoring the Stem Cell Therapy Market

Going by data provided by Precedence Research, the stem cell therapy market is valued at $6.75 billion in 2025 and is expected to witness a CAGR of 12.6% through 2034. Factors like the rising incidence of chronic illnesses like cancer, diabetes and neurological problems, along with the poor effectiveness of current treatments, fuel the need for alternative remedies and drive the market’s growth.

Other News

Omeros announced that it has completed the sale and licensing deal with Novo Nordisk for its drug candidate zaltenibart (OMS906). Zaltenibart is a late-stage, first-in-class antibody that targets MASP-3, a key activator of the complement system and offers advantages over other similar drugs in development or on the market.

The company has formed an Oncology Clinical Steering Committee to guide its OncotoX program for acute myeloid leukemia. The program uses specially designed, small molecules that deliver toxic payloads directly into cancer cells, aiming to kill them and address a major unmet medical need.

In third-quarter fiscal 2025, TGT reported 2.4% digital comps growth and more than 35% expansion in same-day services, reinforcing that guests increasingly expect intuitive, fast and digitally assisted shopping experiences. TGT’s partnership with OpenAI represents a timely leap forward in how consumers discover and purchase products online.

At the core of this initiative is the ability for guests to shop directly through natural-language conversations. By describing what they need — whether a gift idea, a household item or products tied to a specific budget — shoppers receive curated recommendations without navigating menus or search bars. This AI-driven approach aims to replicate the feel of a personalized in-store experience, while streamlining the digital journey from discovery to checkout.

The partnership will also integrate tightly with TGT’s fulfillment ecosystem. Guests will be able to complete multi-item purchases, select Drive Up or pickup options and even shop for fresh foods — all within an OpenAI-powered chat interface. With two-day delivery available to 99% of U.S. households and next-day capabilities now covering more than half the country, TGT is uniquely positioned to operationalize this conversational demand at scale.

Supporting these innovations is a robust AI backbone already reshaping internal operations. Tools like Target Trend Brain and synthetic audiences help identify trends early and test consumer response before launch. On-shelf availability for key items improved more than 150 basis points year over year across TGT’s top 5,000 items.

While discretionary softness remains a headwind, OpenAI-led conversational commerce could provide TGT with a new demand engine. If early traction in marketplace GMV and Roundel ad growth continues, this shift toward AI-powered shopping may meaningfully advance TGT’s digital-led trajectory heading into 2026.

We appreciate the trust being placed in this building by our first official tenant, and look forward to ongoing success as we continue to field strong prospect interest in the project’s remaining available buildings,” Lincoln Property Co. executive vice president John Orsak said in a news release.

As of Monday, SONAR’s Outbound Tender Rejection Index (OTRI) for the Phoenix market stood at 7.42%, rising week over week and signaling potential tightening in local trucking capacity. The increase suggests carriers are becoming more selective as prolonged low rates continue to push marginal operators out of the market.

While tender rejections are climbing, outbound volumes in Phoenix have remained relatively flat or declined compared with the same period in 2024 and 2023. That divergence points to a shifting balance of power, with carriers gaining leverage despite muted demand — an early indication that spot rates could begin moving higher and the shipper-friendly environment may be fading.

Industrial development accelerates around Phoenix

Walmart’s purchase comes amid a wave of new industrial construction across the Phoenix area, particularly in submarkets tied to advanced manufacturing and semiconductor investment.

In north Phoenix’s Deer Valley area, ViaWest Group and Barings have broken ground on ReDiscover Logistics Park, an 808,448-square-foot Class A industrial development targeting suppliers, manufacturers and distributors serving Arizona’s expanding chip ecosystem, In Business Magazine reported.

The site sits around 15 minutes from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s multibillion-dollar fabrication campus, positioning it as a logistics hub for high-value, time-sensitive freight.

Last-mile and logistics firms follow region’s growth

Arizona’s population growth and industrial build-out are also drawing logistics service providers focused on speed and specialization.

Jet Delivery, a 75-year-old same-day and time-critical logistics provider, recently launched Phoenix operations, citing demand from healthcare, manufacturing, aerospace, tech and e-commerce customers for reliable last-mile coverage in the rapidly expanding metro area.

At the same time, Phoenix-based startup Speedora has entered the market with an asset-owned, white-glove delivery model for big and bulky freight, targeting retailers frustrated with damage claims and broker-heavy networks.

The company said Arizona’s growth and proximity to Southern California make it an ideal launchpad for regional expansion, according to a news release.

Specialized logistics firms are also scaling up alongside Phoenix’s industrial real estate boom. RK Logistics Group recently opened an 80,000-square-foot, temperature-controlled warehouse in Tempe, doubling its Phoenix-area footprint to nearly 158,000 square feet to support semiconductor, electric vehicle and renewable energy customers.

Company executives pointed to proximity to Sky Harbor International Airport, interstate highways and rail intermodal facilities as key advantages, reinforcing metro Phoenix’s growing role as a hub for high-value, time-sensitive freight.

Rail investment strengthens Arizona’s freight backbone

Infrastructure investment is reinforcing Arizona’s appeal as a logistics destination. Union Pacific recently completed a major expansion of its Casa Grande Yard west of Tucson, doubling capacity and adding new tracks, industrial leads and signal upgrades along the railroad’s Sunset Route.

The yard serves local industries and supports manifest freight moving across the Southwest.

Rail capacity upgrades are critical to handling growing inbound materials and outbound finished goods tied to manufacturing growth across the state, particularly as shippers seek alternatives to congested coastal gateways.",https://www.freightwaves.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/29/Arizona_freight_market.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 14:00:12.672577

Altman flagged an opening for the company's Head of Preparedness on Saturday in a post on X.
""We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities,"" Altman said, ""but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused.""
This, mind you, came in the wake of a number of high-profile safety leadership exits at the company and a partial reset of OpenAI's safety team structure.
Weng left OpenAI in November 2024, while Candela left his role as head of preparedness in April for a three-month coding internship at OpenAI.","How’d you like to earn more than half a million dollars working for one of the world’s fastest-growing tech companies? The catch: the job is stressful, and the last few people tasked with it didn’t stick around. Over the weekend, OpenAI boss Sam Altman went public with a search for a new Head of Preparedness, saying rapidly improving AI models are creating new risks that need closer oversight.

Altman flagged an opening for the company's Head of Preparedness on Saturday in a post on X. Describing the role, which carries a $555,000 base salary plus equity, as one focused on securing OpenAI's systems and understanding how they could be abused, Altman also noted that AI models are beginning to present ""some real challenges"" as they rapidly improve and gain new capabilities.

""The potential impact of models on mental health was something we saw a preview of in 2025,"" Altman said, without elaborating on specific cases or products.

AI has been flagged as an increasingly common trigger of psychological troubles in both juveniles and adults, with chatbots reportedly linked to multiple deaths in the past year. OpenAI, one of the most popular chatbot makers in the market, rolled back a GPT-4o update in April 2025 after acknowledging it had become overly sycophantic and could reinforce harmful or destabilizing user behavior.

Despite that, OpenAI released ChatGPT-5.1 last month, which included a number of emotional dependence-nurturing features, like the inclusion of emotionally-suggestive language, ""warmer, more intelligent"" responses, and the like. Sure, it might be less sycophantic, but it'll speak to you with more intimacy than ever before, making it feel more like a human companion instead of the impersonal, logical ship computer from Star Trek that spits facts with little regard for feeling.

It's no wonder the company needs someone to steer the ship with regard to model safety.

""We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities,"" Altman said, ""but we are entering a world where we need more nuanced understanding and measurement of how those capabilities could be abused.""

According to the job posting, the Head of Preparedness will be responsible for leading technical strategy and execution of OpenAI's preparedness framework [PDF], which the company describes as its approach ""to tracking and preparing for frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm.""

It's not a new role, mind you, but it's one that's seen more turnover than the Defense Against Dark Arts faculty position at Hogwarts.

Aleksander Madry, director of MIT's Center for Deployable Machine Learning and faculty leader at the Institute's AI Policy Forum, occupied the Preparedness role until July 2024, when OpenAI reassigned him to a reasoning-focused research role.

This, mind you, came in the wake of a number of high-profile safety leadership exits at the company and a partial reset of OpenAI's safety team structure.

OpenAI reorg at risk as Attorneys General push AI safety

In Madry's place, OpenAI appointed Joaquin Quinonero Candela and Lilian Weng to lead the preparedness team. Both occupied other roles at OpenAI prior to heading up preparedness, but neither lasted long in the position. Weng left OpenAI in November 2024, while Candela left his role as head of preparedness in April for a three-month coding internship at OpenAI. While still an OpenAI employee, he's out of the technical space entirely and is now serving as head of recruiting.

""This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately,"" Altman said of the open position.

Understandably so - OpenAI and model safety have long had a contentious relationship, as numerous ex-employees have attested. One executive who left the company in October called the Altman outfit out for not being as focused on safety and the long-term effects of its AGI push as it should be, suggesting that the company was pushing ahead in its goal to dominate the industry at the expense of the rest of society.

Will $555,000 be enough to keep a new Preparedness chief in the role? Skepticism may be warranted.

According to The Wall Street Journal, the businessman has proposed three candidates for the position.

Wilson has proposed Marc Maurer, former CEO of On; Laura Gentile, former marketing director of the U.S. television channel group Espn, and Eric Hirshberg, former CEO of Activision. The businessman is Lululemon’s second largest shareholder, with a stake of close to 9%.

Lululemon announced in December the departure of its CEO, Calvin McDonald, after seven years at the company, under pressure to turn the business around. Wilson, in fact, was one of the voices that pointed most strongly to the need for a profound change. The founder believes that shareholders will not trust any CEO proposed by the current board, so he has initiated the dispute for control of the board.

On the other hand, the Elliott Investment Management fund has accumulated a stake of more than one billion dollars in Lululemon and has announced its bet on Jane Nielsen, former Ralph Lauren executive, as the next CEO.

Wilson accumulates a 9% stake in Lululemon

Wilson stepped down as CEO of Lululemon in 2005, with the sale of 48% of the company to private equity firm Advent International. The company went public in 2007, with a valuation in excess of $1.2 billion.

The founder held the chairmanship until 2013, when a scandal over a television interview caused him to resign. He left the board for good in 2015 and, since then, up to four CEOs have tried to bring stability to the company.

Wilson later invested in Amer Sports, the Finnish sportswear parent company of outdoor brands such as Arc’teryx, Wilson, Salomon and Atomic; as well as in China’s Anta, one of the world’s largest sports industry groups, which is reportedly considering buying Puma.

The latest results recently published point to a two-speed fiscal year for Lululemon. The company posted a turnover of $2,565.9 million in the third quarter of the year, up 7% from the same period last year. However, its net profit fell by 12.8%, from $351.9 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $306.8 million in the same period of the current fiscal year.",https://www.modaes.com/global/thumb/eyJ0IjoiZCIsInciOjEyMDAsImgiOjY3NSwibSI6MSwidiI6IjEuMC4wNyJ9/files/2025/redaccion-empresas/lululemon/chip-wilson-lululemon-1200.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 14:14:01.124846

His death was announced by current CEO Arvind Krishna in an internal message to employees, though no cause was shared. Gerstner is best known for taking over IBM in April 1993 during a time when the company was in severe trouble and facing either bankruptcy or a breakup. Because of what followed, his nine-year tenure is often considered one of the most successful corporate turnarounds in history.

Indeed, after becoming IBM’s first-ever outside CEO, Gerstner moved quickly to change the company’s direction. More specifically, he stopped plans to split IBM into smaller units and instead kept the company together, while aggressively cutting costs and selling off underperforming assets, including real estate and artwork. He also laid off about 35,000 employees, which ended a culture of lifetime employment. At the same time, he changed how IBM operated by pushing teamwork across divisions, tying pay to companywide performance, and holding managers accountable more frequently.

Strategically, he moved IBM away from bundled hardware-only products, shut down failing projects like the OS/2 operating system, and shifted the focus toward software and services. As a result, IBM’s business changed dramatically. Services revenue grew from $7.4 billion in 1992 to $30 billion by 2001, while the company’s share price climbed from about $13 to $80. Gerstner also made early bets on the internet, enterprise networking, and key acquisitions such as Lotus Development, which strengthened IBM’s software offerings. He eventually stepped down in 2002 and remained active in philanthropy.

Market Update

In response to the Fed’s rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has been gradually trending down from its post-pandemic peak, trending closer to the Fed’s 2% target. Despite higher borrowing costs, the economy has avoided flashing recessionary signals. This is the much-desired soft landing that many investors hoped for. The recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% in November 2024) have bolstered the stock market, making 2024 a strong year for equities. Donald Trump’s presidential win in November sparked additional market gains, sending indices to record highs in the days following his victory. However, debates continue over possible tariffs and corporate tax adjustments, raising questions about economic stability in 2025.

The direction of packaging trends has morphed over the past decades, especially as society has wrestled with finding a balance between food preservation and sustainability.
“I’ve heard packaging described as a superhero — that we’re just asking it to do so many things,” said Allison Reser, director of sustainability and innovation at the Pet Sustainability Coalition.
“In the regenerative robust gasification process, we can handle all of these materials,” Welt said.
“It’s not up to a meat and poultry manufacturer to not provide packaging because someone might litter with it.","One thing packaging professionals can agree upon is we’re not where we need to be. Despite decades of a push toward more sustainable packaging, the consumer goods industry has yet to find a truly circular solution.

So often in packaging innovation, durability competes with sustainability. At a time when consumer confidence in food safety is on the decline, retaining strong barriers in meat and poultry packaging remains critical. Yet, sacrificing environmentally friendly materials and processes is not an option either.

The direction of packaging trends has morphed over the past decades, especially as society has wrestled with finding a balance between food preservation and sustainability.

“There was a shift as I started my career to removing the butcher from the supermarket,” said Bruce Welt, PhD, professor of packaging engineering at the University of Florida. “There was that period initially where there was a guy in a bloody smock with knives that was cutting up meat. He or she would wrap it in a Styrofoam-type tray and slap a label on it. That was unbranded and store packaged.

“Then with the advent of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) and to some extent some use of carbon monoxide … a variety of packages came out.”

Innovations like the vacuum skin pack, master packs and semi-rigid trays were introduced.

“The vacuum skin packs brought multi-layer barrier film with fantastic graphics,” Welt said. “The MAP trays brought a sense of cleanliness. They weren’t leaking. And also a variety of films that either were highly permeable or not permeable, and then the whole variety of foodservice packaging — chubs and everything else — a great variety of materials that achieved the purpose and served humanity in a very efficient way. These are very low-cost, high-performing applications that now people are not happy with for some reason.”

The dissatisfaction Welt referred to is often due to the difficulty of recycling materials used in these multi-layer materials.

“I’ve heard packaging described as a superhero — that we’re just asking it to do so many things,” said Allison Reser, director of sustainability and innovation at the Pet Sustainability Coalition.

Reser noted that multi-material films feature several layers to serve a distinct purpose, whether that’s strength, moisture, oxygen, etc.

“There’s a lot of thought that’s been put into that design, but that design inherently is very difficult to recycle or do something with after it’s done because, to recycle something, you technically need to peel apart all those different layers and then turn those back into resins to then turn back into something else,” she explained.

What’s in the bag actually matters a lot more than the bag itself, according to Reser, as packaging typically only makes up 10% to 30% of a product’s overall environmental impact.

“But at the same time, I think we can do better,” Reser said. “We can streamline the functions of the package to design in true circularity.”

A proposed solution

For Reser, improvement looks like considering both the short-term and the long-term.

On the short-term, Reser encourages companies to switch to eco-friendly technology like mono-material packaging that is already available at scale.

“But then, even mono-material plastic or paper, those aren’t regenerative solutions,” Reser said. “They are less bad than other options. But long term I would love to see more innovation and focus on truly circular solutions.”

Welt has been working on developing exactly that — a circular solution for the packaging waste problem.

His team of researchers at the University of Florida have created what’s known as Regenerative Robust Gasification (RRG), an advanced recycling system that is able to take in any form of packaging material, and without the need to sort or separate, it can convert those substances into synthesis gas. From synthesis gas, many practical applications can be formed, but Welt advocates for the usage of methanol in particular.

“It’s a very versatile compound, synthesis gas; however, it’s not easy to transport,” Welt said. “In order to make this widely available to manufacturing, we have to convert it into something that can be transported. And the simplest thing to do is methanol.”

Welt noted that a lot of packaging today is not recyclable in our existing system — anything with mixed materials, including labels.

“In the regenerative robust gasification process, we can handle all of these materials,” Welt said. “With the right infrastructure for handling our waste, we don’t have to think as much about the materials. We can think more about the packaging application.”

Reser agrees that a new chemical recycling system could have a positive impact on redirecting material waste.

“My take on any of these advanced recycling systems is that it seems like a promising short-term solution to deal with all of this material that we already have out in the world,” she said.

However, Reser expressed caution in saying the technology could solve all the industry’s problems, given other factors that need to be taken into consideration.

“Is it using a lot more energy? Is it using a lot more water? Are there trade-offs that we need to consider before we go all into that kind of technology?” she asked.

Government involvement

As researchers and innovators continue to look for ways to improve the current recycling system, legislation has played more of a role in recent years in an attempt to address the issue.

To date, seven states — Maine, Oregon, Colorado, California, Minnesota, Maryland and Washington — have introduced Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) legislation. The laws require food manufacturers to pay fees to manage the recycling of their products rather than holding municipalities and taxpayers financially and operationally responsible.

“That incentivizing companies to switch to better packaging is one positive outcome of these laws,” Reser said. “The other intent is that, with those fees, the municipalities are able to improve their recycling infrastructure.”

While Reser sees the implementation of EPRs as a step in the right direction toward creating a more sustainable future, Welt finds concerns with the new laws.

“I think ultimately the responsibility is on the municipality; it’s not on the producer,” he said.

“It’s the responsibility of the municipality through law enforcement to punish litterers,” Welt elaborated. “It’s not up to a meat and poultry manufacturer to not provide packaging because someone might litter with it. That’s just insane.”

Welt explained his viewpoint that the EPR laws are a violation of the Commerce Clause.

“When the Articles of Confederation were done in the United States, and we were a bunch of different states with their independent power before the Constitution, that’s what they were doing to each other — the states were taxing each other,” he said. “When we had the Constitution, the founders saw that this was a significant problem impeding interstate commerce, so they specifically put into the Constitution that states wouldn’t tariff other states, and that’s effectively what EPR is.”

Welt noted that EPR is currently being challenged in Oregon.

“Hopefully EPR will be a flash in the pan, and we will figure out a way to get away from that,” he said. “But I would certainly say that the industry should stop just bending over and taking this stuff and really put up a fight and not acquiesce to EPR.”",https://www.supermarketperimeter.com/ext/resources/2021/6/Sustainable-packaging_Lead1.png?height=635&t=1707863805&width=1200,N,,2025-12-29 13:01:57.128390

Instead, Samsung plans to bring Google Photos to its televisions.

The addition of Google Photos will allow users to view images from their Google account, with Samsung detailing that deep integration is planned. That will see Google Photos accessed as part of Daily+ and Daily Board for a seamless experience, while there are plans to have a number of ways to curate the images seen.

That will include Memories, Create with AI and Personalised Results, with Memories being an exclusive feature for Samsung TVs for the first 6 months. This exclusivity is familiar territory for Samsung and an key indicator that these features will be available on other platforms too – most likely Google TV which is found on Sony, Philips and other TVs.

Memories will allow you to curate stories based on people or locations to be shown on your Samsung TV. That sounds like a great way to show off the grandkids at a family gathering, for example.

Create with AI uses templates built on Nano Banana to transform photos into something more interesting, while Personalised Results will show photos related to topics, like a place or activity.

That means it's not just going to be a random selection of Google Photos that get displayed, but something that you have more control over.

An indication of future TV features?

The move suggests that Google is looking for ways to unlock some of its content and make it available elsewhere. Photos aren't new on TVs: most platforms already offer some way to show images, whether through access to a particular online gallery or via casting in some form.

But these always seem a little random where you never know what's going to be shown. Moving toward a personally curated experience will provide the satisfaction that users want, knowing that it's not just going to be a collection of screenshots, photos of the floor and all the rest of the stuff that fills your Google Photos library.

Instead, I'm expecting to be able to call up pictures of the cat to share with everyone all the time. Showing holiday snaps will be easy, while it looks like Samsung will also bubble up memories similar to Google Photos based around time.

Samsung says that these features will appear through 2026, with Memories the first to arrive in early 2026, followed by the other two options ""later in 2026"".",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGzks4B8xeoSNcCpHdsweW-789-80.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 12:01:17.364640

Today, Intel has officially sold 214.7 million shares to Nvidia at $23.28 per share, reports Reuters. At the time of the original announcement, that number was 6% above market price, but it's now 36% below what Intel is currently trading at.

The purchase was cleared by the FTC in early December, so it was only a matter of time before we received this news. Intel is worth $172.67 billion at the time of writing, a drastic recovery from 2024 and much of 2025, where it had been valued as low as $82.71 billion.

Over the years, Intel's massive capex spending had put a strain on its financials, which was paired with growing national security concerns over CEO Lip-Bu Tan's former ties to China. Just a few months ago, this commotion had transpired into a dire situation where President Trump was seeking to oust CEO Lip-Bu Tan, but the two eventually reconciled, leading to Washington purchasing an $8.9 billion stake in Intel.

Live Update At 10:03:00 EST: On Monday, December 29, 2025 NVIDIA Corporation stock [NASDAQ: NVDA] is trending down by -1.99%! Discover the key drivers behind this movement as well as our expert analysis in the detailed breakdown below.

Earnings Report and Financial Overview

One of the key strategies for traders is to remain objective and not let emotions drive trading decisions. As Tim Bohen, lead trainer with StocksToTrade, says, “I focus on what a stock is doing, not what I want it to do. Let the stock prove itself before you make a move.” This approach emphasizes the importance of analyzing actual market performance instead of being swayed by personal desires or expectations. By adhering to this mindset, traders can make more informed and strategic decisions, rather than relying on assumptions or wishful thinking.

Nvidia recently released its earnings report reflecting a landscape filled with strong profits alongside growing challenges. The company reported a massive revenue jump, showcasing $130.5B, aligning with unstoppable demand in GPU markets. With an enterprise valuation reaching close to $4.8T, Nvidia’s financial health seems robust from a snapshot view. However, peeling back the layers reveals complexities.

For starters, Nvidia’s remarkable 62.2% EBIT margin indicates operational efficiency. Yet the high P/E ratio standing at 47.28 raises eyebrows among cautious investors. From an income statement perspective, their EBITDA reported at $38.72B signifies substantial earnings before accounting adjustments.

In the broader context, Nvidia’s adaptive strategies reflect in its decision to forego Intel’s process in its chip production lines. This move didn’t fly well with investors, judging by the negative ripples in stock valuations. Moreover, strategic moves like SoftBank’s unloading of Nvidia shares indeed inject a layer of uncertainty, although Nvidia basks in investor goodwill built from years of innovation.

The shadows of Google’s aggressive push into AI computing loom, potentially slicing into Nvidia’s market share in the coming quarters. And Nvidia’s restructuring within the cloud division underscores a pivot from previously competitive stances to perhaps a collaborative or niche-focused approach. This news of high-ranking executives stepping aside introduces subtle doubts about the future trajectory of Nvidia’s cloud dominance.

Impact of Recent News on Stock

SoftBank Divestment: A Bold Move?

SoftBank is no stranger to bold moves, and its latest decision to partially divest from Nvidia is just that. Aimed at bolstering its commitment to OpenAI, this maneuver saw SoftBank selling hefty stakes. The shift, while financially driven for SoftBank, casts a slight cloud over Nvidia, indicating a multifaceted relationship entwined with market strategizing and fulfilling fiscal promises.

For Nvidia, it beckons investors to re-evaluate strategic ties and dependencies. Indeed, every shift prompts a corresponding adjustment in share price, especially when magnitude and timing mix into the equation.

Competitive Edge at Stake: Google’s Innovation

Google, with its fingers in the pie of AI computing, poses more than a mild threat to Nvidia’s stronghold. Google’s new initiative isn’t just a sideline attraction; it’s an audacious leap into territories Nvidia inhabits confidently. While Nvidia’s core audience expects innovation, the duel for dominance in AI computing could alter financial landscapes moving forward.

Should Google succeed in capturing even a fraction of Nvidia’s target audience, the implications on profits and market stance would be tangible. Nvidia’s investors are right to pay close attention—these developments could very well dictate stock performance over lengthy periods.

Leadership Changes: Strategic Restructuring

Nvidia’s internal shake-up in the cloud sector may seem minor, but in strategic landscapes, they can signify deeper objectives. By restructuring the cloud division and shifting talented executives, Nvidia hints at realigning operational trajectories. These shifts are likely intended to hedge against heavily resourced, competitor-dominated fields like those controlled by Amazon Web Services.

Such restructuring rarely leaves stock prices untouched. Investors mull over these decisions, contemplating long-term benefits against short-term disruptions. While beneficial restructuring is geared at maintaining innovative agility, its impartial results remain subject to speculation.

Future Directions and Considerations

In the wake of these pivotal shifts, Nvidia is embroiled in transformations likely to excite and challenge stakeholders alike. Its operational excellence discussed might sway market sentiments to positive or negative poles, depending significantly on upcoming executions of strategic pivots, especially in the cloud division.

Balancing profitability amidst fierce competition, both internal and strategic, will spotlight Nvidia’s nimble adaptability. In future quarters, Nvidia’s enduring superior performance will either shine a light on successful strategy or prompt reconsideration in the eyes of cautious market participants. As Tim Bohen, lead trainer with StocksToTrade says, “I never chase price. The best opportunities allow me to enter on my terms, not when I’m feeling pressured.” This philosophy might resonate with market traders observing Nvidia’s next moves, pushing them to assess entry points based on strategic successes rather than market hype.

Strategically, Nvidia needs to ensure its future-proofing measures, reinforcing areas like AI computing while bolstering its unique values against up-and-coming disruptors like Google’s. Dynamic industry movements necessitate equally adept responses, simultaneously assuring stakeholders while leveraging innovation to remain at industry pinnacles.

Navigating these competitive waters, Nvidia remains a stalwart, inspiring intrigue and analytical scrutiny worldwide. As the narrative develops, watch closely—Nvidia’s next moves are not just speculative intrigue, but essential business evolution recognized across technological and financial realms.

Tags: #Broadcom #AVGO #Semiconductors #AI #VMware #StockMarket #TechAnalysis #HockTan #Investing","As 2025 draws to a close, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) has solidified its position not merely as a semiconductor manufacturer, but as the indispensable architect of the generative AI revolution. While NVIDIA often captures the headlines for its dominant GPUs, Broadcom provides the critical ""connective tissue"" and custom brainpower that allow these GPUs to function as a coherent, massive-scale system.

In the final week of 2025, Broadcom sits at a fascinating intersection of hardware prowess and software stability. Having successfully digested its massive $69 billion acquisition of VMware, the company has transformed its profile into a ""software-hardware hybrid"" with high recurring revenues and some of the fattest margins in the technology sector. This article explores how a company once known for diverse commodity chips has become a mission-critical infrastructure giant worth nearly $1 trillion.

Historical Background

Broadcom’s history is a masterclass in strategic evolution and aggressive consolidation. The company’s roots trace back to the original Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) semiconductor division, which was spun off as Agilent Technologies in 1999. In 2005, the private equity firms KKR and Silver Lake acquired Agilent’s chip group, forming Avago Technologies.

The modern era began when Hock Tan became CEO in 2006. Under Tan’s leadership, Avago launched a series of high-stakes acquisitions: LSI Corp in 2013, the original Broadcom Corp in 2016 (taking its name), and Brocade Communications in 2017. Tan’s strategy was clear: buy ""franchise"" assets—products that are #1 or #2 in their niche with high barriers to entry—and optimize them for cash flow.

In 2018, following a blocked hostile bid for Qualcomm, Broadcom shifted its focus toward infrastructure software, acquiring CA Technologies ($19B) and Symantec’s enterprise security business ($11B). This culminated in the late 2023 acquisition of VMware, a move that fundamentally altered the company’s revenue mix and defensive characteristics.

Business Model

Broadcom operates through two primary reporting segments: Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software.

Semiconductor Solutions (~60% of Revenue): This segment provides high-performance semiconductor products for data center networking, set-top boxes, broadband access, and wireless communication. Its crown jewels are its Ethernet switching silicon (Tomahawk and Jericho lines) and its Custom AI Silicon (ASIC) business, where it co-designs chips for hyper-scalers like Google and Meta.

Infrastructure Software (~40% of Revenue): This segment has expanded dramatically with VMware. It focuses on helping large enterprises manage complex hybrid cloud environments. The business model has shifted from one-time perpetual licenses to a high-margin, recurring subscription model.

The ""Broadcom way"" involves focusing on the most profitable 20% of customers—the global Fortune 500 and mega-scale cloud providers—who have ""sticky"" needs and deep pockets.

Stock Performance Overview

Broadcom has been a generational wealth creator. Over the last 10 years, the stock has delivered a total return (including dividends) exceeding 3,000%, vastly outperforming the S&P 500 and most of its peers in the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOXX).

1-Year Performance (2025): The stock surged approximately 52% in 2025, buoyed by the ""Ethernet Crossover"" (the trend of using Ethernet over proprietary InfiniBand for AI clusters) and successful VMware synergies.

5-Year Performance: AVGO has seen a nearly 400% rise, driven by the explosion of cloud computing and the initial waves of GenAI.

The Split: In July 2024, Broadcom executed a 10-for-1 stock split to make its then-$1,700 share price more accessible to retail investors. As of late December 2025, the stock trades in the $340–$360 range (post-split).

Financial Performance

Broadcom’s fiscal 2025 financials reflect a ""best-of-both-worlds"" profile: growth in AI hardware combined with stable cash flow in software.

Revenue: Total revenue for FY2025 reached approximately $64.2 billion, a 24% year-over-year increase.

Margins: The company achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 68%, a figure more common for pure-play software companies than hardware manufacturers.

Free Cash Flow (FCF): Broadcom generated $26.9 billion in FCF in FY2025. This cash flow supports a robust dividend policy, currently yielding approximately 1.5% with a consistent history of double-digit annual increases.

Valuation: Trading at roughly 28x forward earnings, AVGO is not ""cheap"" by historical standards, but it carries a premium due to its near-monopoly in AI networking and high software backlog ($73 billion).

Leadership and Management

CEO Hock Tan is widely regarded as one of the most effective capital allocators in corporate history. His management style is decentralized and ruthlessly efficient. He organizes the company into autonomous business units, each responsible for its own P&L, but all held to a singular standard of profitability.

Tan’s leadership has not been without controversy; his aggressive price hikes at VMware and CA Technologies have drawn the ire of some legacy customers. However, for shareholders, his ""private equity-style"" management of a public company has yielded industry-leading returns. In late 2025, Tan’s contract was extended through 2030, ensuring continuity in this high-discipline strategy.

Products, Services, and Innovations

Broadcom's competitive edge lies in its R&D depth in high-speed connectivity.

Tomahawk 6: Launched in late 2025, this 102.4 Tbps switching chip is the industry benchmark for moving data within AI ""super-clusters.""

Custom AI Accelerators (ASICs): Broadcom dominates the market for custom chips. It co-developed Google’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) TPU v6 and is currently working with Meta (NASDAQ: META) on its MTIA chips. These custom designs are more power-efficient than general-purpose GPUs for specific workloads.

VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF): This is the flagship software offering that allows enterprises to run a ""private cloud"" with the same efficiency as a public cloud, a key trend for companies worried about data privacy in the AI era.

Competitive Landscape

Broadcom faces different rivals in each of its segments:

In Networking: Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL) is its closest competitor in custom silicon and optical DSPs. NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) competes via its Spectrum-X Ethernet platform and Mellanox InfiniBand, though Broadcom maintains an edge in open-standard Ethernet.

In Software: VMware competes with Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Azure and various open-source containerization tools, though its legacy footprint in the enterprise data center remains massive.

Strengths: Unrivaled scale, deep patent portfolio (20,000+ patents), and a ""closed"" ecosystem of high-end networking that is difficult for smaller players to replicate.

Industry and Market Trends

The dominant trend in 2025 is the shift toward ""AI Infrastructure 2.0."" Initial AI spending focused purely on GPUs; the current phase focuses on networking to prevent data bottlenecks.

Another key trend is the ""Ethernet Crossover."" For years, NVIDIA’s InfiniBand was the gold standard for low-latency AI training. In 2025, however, Ethernet (led by Broadcom) became the preferred choice for massive multi-rack deployments due to its superior scalability and lower cost, providing a significant tailwind for the Tomahawk and Jericho product lines.

Risks and Challenges

Despite its strengths, Broadcom faces several headwinds:

Apple Dependency: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) historically accounts for ~20% of revenue. Apple’s long-term goal of insourcing Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular modem chips poses a ""top-line cliff"" risk, though Broadcom has mitigated this with long-term supply agreements through 2026.

High Debt: The VMware acquisition left Broadcom with a significant debt load. While it is paying this down rapidly using its massive FCF, high interest rates make debt servicing a non-negligible expense.

Customer Concentration: A handful of cloud giants (Google, Meta, Amazon) drive a large portion of the custom chip revenue. If one were to pull back or switch to internal design only, the impact would be significant.

Opportunities and Catalysts

OpenAI Partnership: In 2025, reports emerged of a lead design partnership with OpenAI for a custom inference chip (""Project Titan""), which could be a multi-billion dollar catalyst for 2026 and 2027.

Anthropic Infrastructure: A reported $11 billion deal to provide networking and custom silicon for Anthropic’s AI clusters provides a visible growth runway.

VMware Upselling: Broadcom is successfully moving legacy VMware customers to the ""Cloud Foundation"" bundle, significantly increasing the average revenue per user (ARPU).

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish on AVGO. As of December 2025, roughly 85% of analysts cover the stock with a ""Buy"" or ""Strong Buy"" rating. Institutional ownership remains high, with firms like Vanguard and BlackRock holding significant stakes.

Retail sentiment is also strong, particularly following the 2024 stock split, which made the company a popular ""Blue Chip AI"" play for individual portfolios. The primary debate among analysts is whether the AI growth is ""pulled forward"" or represents a sustainable new baseline of demand.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

Geopolitics remain the ""wild card."" Broadcom derives roughly 20% of its revenue from China.

Tariffs: In late 2025, the U.S. government announced a delay in certain semiconductor tariffs until mid-2027, giving Broadcom more time to diversify its supply chain.

Export Controls: Tightening restrictions on high-end AI chips and networking equipment to China act as a persistent headwind for Broadcom’s data center business in that region.

Antitrust: The VMware acquisition was approved after intense scrutiny in the EU and China, but any future large-scale software acquisitions would likely face an even higher regulatory bar.

Conclusion

Broadcom Inc. enters 2026 as a titan of the modern era. It has successfully navigated the complexities of integrating VMware while capturing the lion's share of the AI networking market. For investors, AVGO offers a unique proposition: the growth potential of a semiconductor AI play, paired with the defensive, cash-cow characteristics of an enterprise software giant.

While risks related to China and the ""Apple Cliff"" remain, Broadcom’s dominance in the ""plumbing"" of the AI world makes it a difficult company to bet against.

What I Liked From Hanover, Chris Black’s New Basics Brand","Photo: Michael Zhao

Shopping at Hanover, longtime Strategist columnist Chris Black’s new clothing line, is like stumbling across a stash of perfectly faded vintage Ralph Lauren with none of the off-putting odors and stains associated with thrifted men’s sportswear. While not quite as cheap as vintage, the prices are surprisingly low for new clothes that are entirely produced in Los Angeles. The most expensive offering is a $155 pair of jeans made of deadstock North Carolinian denim — more than $100 cheaper than a comparable pair from Buck Mason.

It sounds too good to be true, but each piece I tried felt sturdily made from high-quality materials. I am a slender six-foot-two, which makes me a medium in most brands. But Hanover’s team sent large tops across the board, and that was definitely the right call. The first run is selling out quickly, so I wasn’t able to try everything, but I’ve compiled photos and notes for all the pieces I managed to test, starting with my favorites and ending with the rest.

This 100 percent cotton pique polo shirt made me nostalgic for the Ralph Lauren shirts I’d find in my dad’s closet as a kid: softened from decades of washing and drying with the reassuring heft of a garment that’s made to a higher standard than it needs to be. True to its description, it looks good tucked or untucked. And I especially appreciated how the collar still rests flatly against my upper chest when one or both buttons are unfastened, as I’m wont to wear it. At just under $100, it’s priced in line with what Todd Snyder charges for a similar unfaded style that’s produced in Portugal.

Between its natural-looking fade, smallish hood, and metal grommets for a missing drawstring, this sweatshirt feels like something that could have been salvaged from a schoolyard lost and found in a good way. (Also available as a crewneck.) It’s much softer than the similarly priced and factory-faded Trash Hoodie from Everybody.World, and I’ve been enjoying throwing it over my PJs first thing in the morning when I roll out of bed to make my coffee. Although it’s said to be made from a 20-ounce fabric, it’s about 200 grams lighter than the 13-ounce Trash Hoodie, so I’d guess it’s closer to a 12-ounce.

Black is known to prefer vintage tees to new ones, so it’s no surprise that his idealized version of a new T-shirt would come prewashed to a perfectly worn-in fade and texture. I wear a 38R jacket and found the large fit perfectly. The shoulder seams fell right at the outer edge of my shoulders and the hem right above my crotch — short enough to look neat untucked yet long enough to tuck if a look calls for it. Besides this charcoal fade, it comes in red, green, and blue. Blink and you’ll miss the tonal-matched embroidered H logo on the bottom left.

I have no complaints about this nice black T-shirt, but for the same price, I’d go with the Sunwashed version every time because the more neutral-tone fade is easier to layer. I appreciate that it comes in white (and also blue and charcoal), but if I wanted a plain white T-shirt at this price, I would likely get the Lady White Co LW101T instead.

Hanover Tote

It’s not that this isn’t a great tote; I just have to wonder whether everyone who snatched it up realized how big it was when they ordered it. At 15-by-18-by-5 inches, it’s about the same size as a large L.L.Bean Boat and Tote and can hold about a week’s worth of laundry — way too big for any kind of daily use. (It offers a mini-tote too, but no measurements are provided.) The canvas material is much less stiff than L.L.Bean’s, which makes it a bit more comfortable to carry. It also features a prominent American flag patch, which aligns with Hanover’s made-in-USA ethos but may give pause to some.

We are in the midst of a full-on denim-head revival, rivaling that of the Obama presidency, which is why I was excited to try these jeans made from deadstock Cone Mills denim, which ceased production in 2017. I got the lightwash fade in a size 30 and was impressed by their construction and material quality. The fade looks natural and credibly vintage — the subtly abraded hems and edges really sell it, and the suede brand patch with the belt pass-through has a luxuriously soft texture that should develop a nice patina over time. But the cut through the thighs was so slim that I could feel it constricting my circulation every time I sat down. Based on how these pants fit the models in the product photos, sizing up to a 32 would have likely helped achieve the more tapered fit I look for in a pair of jeans (see the made-in-USA vintage Levi’s 550s for reference), but that would definitely require a belt, since the 30 fit me well in the waist.

Subscribe now and take control of your AI investment future!","When Jeff Bezos said that one breakthrough technology would shape Amazon’s destiny, even Wall Street’s biggest analysts were caught off guard.

Fast forward a year and Amazon’s new CEO Andy Jassy described generative AI as a “once-in-a-lifetime” technology that is already being used across Amazon to reinvent customer experiences.

At the 8th Future Investment Initiative conference, Elon Musk predicted that by 2040 there would be at least 10 billion humanoid robots, with each priced between $20,000 and $25,000.

Do the math. According to Musk, this technology could be worth $250 trillion by 2040.

Put another way, that’s roughly equal to:

175 Teslas

107 Amazons

140 Metas

84 Googles

65 Microsofts

And 55 Nvidias

And here’s the wild part — this $250 trillion wave isn’t tied to one company, but to an entire ecosystem of AI innovators set to reshape the global economy.

It’s a leap so massive, it could reshape how businesses, governments, and consumers operate worldwide.

Even if that $250 trillion figure sounds ambitious, major firms like PwC and McKinsey still see AI unlocking multi-trillion-dollar potential.

How could anything be worth that much?

The answer lies in a breakthrough so powerful it’s redefining how humanity works, learns, and creates.

And this breakthrough has already set off a frenzy among hedge funds and Wall Street’s top investors.

What most investors don’t realize is that one under-owned company holds the key to this $250 trillion revolution.

In fact, Verge argues this company’s supercheap AI technology should concern rivals.

Before I reveal the details, let’s talk about how some of the richest people on the planet are positioning themselves.

Bill Gates sees artificial intelligence as the “biggest technological advance in my lifetime,” more transformative than the internet or personal computer, capable of improving healthcare, education, and addressing climate change.

Larry Ellison — through Oracle, is spending billions on Nvidia chips and partnering with Cohere to embed generative AI across Oracle’s cloud and apps.

Warren Buffett — not known for tech hype — says this breakthrough could have a ‘hugely beneficial social impact.

When billionaires from Silicon Valley to Wall Street line up behind the same idea — you know it’s worth paying attention to.

Even as we admire what Tesla, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Microsoft have built, we believe an even greater opportunity lies elsewhere…

Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

The Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world’s brightest minds are flocking to AI.

From computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.

This influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.

By investing in AI, you’re essentially backing the future.

The future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.

Don’t be a spectator in this technological revolution.

Dive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.

This isn’t just about making money – it’s about being part of the future.

The campaign represents a sophisticated, multi-faceted initial access broker operation targeting Adobe ColdFusion servers alongside 46 additional technology stacks across nearly 800 vulnerabilities.
The primary attack wave focused on 10+ Adobe ColdFusion CVEs, with researchers identifying just under 6,000 direct requests against ColdFusion infrastructure.
The threat actors operated from AS152194 (CTG Server Limited), a Hong Kong-registered hosting provider with documented associations to phishing infrastructure and spam operations.
Security researchers have identified the network as hosting FUNNULL CDN infrastructure targeting luxury brands.","Security researchers have uncovered a massive coordinated exploitation campaign where threat actors launched over 2.5 million malicious requests against vulnerable systems during the Christmas 2025 holiday period.

The campaign represents a sophisticated, multi-faceted initial access broker operation targeting Adobe ColdFusion servers alongside 46 additional technology stacks across nearly 800 vulnerabilities.

The primary attack wave focused on 10+ Adobe ColdFusion CVEs, with researchers identifying just under 6,000 direct requests against ColdFusion infrastructure.

However, deeper analysis revealed the true scope: two primary IP addresses operating from Japan-based hosting provider CTG Server Limited generated over 2.5 million requests across 767 distinct CVEs, leveraging approximately 10,000 unique callback domains for attack verification.

The threat actors deliberately timed the campaign for maximum impact, concentrating 68 percent of attack traffic on Christmas Day when security teams typically operate at reduced capacity.

This deliberate timing suggests a sophisticated threat actor with operational knowledge of enterprise security monitoring cycles.

The attackers used ProjectDiscovery Interactsh out-of-band callback infrastructure to verify successful exploitation attempts in real-time, enabling rapid identification of vulnerable systems suitable for follow-up compromise.

The campaign exploited critical vulnerabilities including CVE-2023-26359, a deserialization RCE affecting ColdFusion, which received 833 exploitation attempts.

CVE-2023-38205, an access control bypass, was targeted 654 times, while CVE-2023-44353 triggered 611 requests.

The primary attack vector employed JNDI/LDAP injection through WDDX deserialization, leveraging the JdbcRowSetImpl gadget chain to trigger remote code execution.

Beyond ColdFusion, the campaign demonstrates methodical reconnaissance across enterprise infrastructure.

Researchers at Greynoise identified 4,118 unique HTTP fingerprints and targeting of Java application servers, web frameworks, CMS platforms, Atlassian products, network devices, and surveillance systems.

Confluence OGNL vulnerability CVE-2022-26134 alone received 12,481 requests, while the legacy Shellshock vulnerability CVE-2014-6271 triggered 8,527 attempts.

The threat actors operated from AS152194 (CTG Server Limited), a Hong Kong-registered hosting provider with documented associations to phishing infrastructure and spam operations.

Security researchers have identified the network as hosting FUNNULL CDN infrastructure targeting luxury brands. This combination of abuse history and rapid IP space acquisition suggests limited abuse enforcement mechanisms.

Organizations operating Adobe ColdFusion servers should immediately apply security patches for CVE-2023-26359, CVE-2023-38205, and related vulnerabilities.

Security teams should implement network-based detection for JNDI injection payloads, OAST callback domains, and the identified threat actor IP addresses and JA4+ network fingerprints.

Continuous vulnerability scanning and monitoring of exploitation attempt patterns remain critical defensive priorities.",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhzGKViVlGuFSaAwvsLqTMQ0Hk66M87-Ct26wadZIX1kSmXUA4wqXEZQlmr4ulvD_8yuRocffm__8TqJDKta00uvZmOkA3vNnhwJsvKuPuz9P0TjIsQm2Fw7BDy_mepKZ6wiwzRVyfv-rMEzR-XZBYQ5kfu9t8Fy1qaIpjEBr6odbA-oQa-EP9h4TRkPjwd/s1600/Hackers%20Launch%202.5%20Million+%20Malicious%20Requests%20Targeting%20Adobe%20ColdFusion%20Servers%20%281%29.webp,N,,2025-12-29 11:13:54.203857

Despite initial fears of the sky falling, April’s bout of volatility following the announcements did not last long, and those who bought the dip were rewarded.

Equity markets seem comfortable with the view that the hit to growth, global trade flows and corporate margins will be modest at best, although it remains to be seen whether companies start to pass on any latent price increases in the coming year.

This was not the only story of a fascinating year, however.

Bonds welcomed cooler inflation and interest rate cuts, and looked forward to more of the same in 2026, while dollar weakness boosted commodities, as well as emerging equities.

However, the strength in gold and silver – and year-end weakness in cryptocurrencies – struck a discordant note in some ways. Both trends suggested that someone, somewhere was expecting trouble in 2026.

It is therefore worth thinking about what happened in 2025 and why, and whether five trends in particular can continue in the coming year and beyond.

1. Tariff and trade worries melted away

Global equity markets motored higher as Trump first delayed the imposition of tariffs until August, then struck individual deals with certain countries. It wasn’t long until he then backed away further in the autumn with a series of agreements with Latin American trade partners, as American voters grumbled about rising food prices.

Still, the Yale Budget Lab estimated that the effective tariff rate by November was 16.8pc, the highest since 1935. US government revenues from the levies jumped sharply enough for Trump to ponder publicly whether they could fund tax cuts for many Americans, although the Supreme Court continues to assess the legality of the reciprocal tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

If that court case fails to knock down the IEEPA tariffs, it remains unclear what the levies may mean for trade, corporate profits and prices in 2026. Any unexpected slowdown in growth, margin pressure or stickiness in inflation could therefore be a nasty surprise.

4. Oil slid lower

Even war in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, sanctions against large oil‑producing nations and the absence of any economic shocks could not help the oil price catch a bid. Brent crude peaked just north of $80 (£60) in January and then ground lower for the rest of the year.

This helped to put a lid on inflation, but the crude price slide persuaded investors to shun oil companies’ shares, in the view that hydrocarbon assets could be left stranded, with a much-reduced value compared to current expectations.

The stock market capitalisation of the S&P Global 1200 Energy sector is just 3.3pc of that of the overall S&P Global 1200 index, well below the long-term average of 7.7pc, let alone 2007’s peak of 13.8pc.

If Brent crude starts to rise again, for whatever reason, that could yet challenge this rejection of oil firms’ shares, and the narrative that inflation will remain modest.

5. Gold and silver shone

Gold and silver are both into their third bull markets since Richard Nixon withdrew the US from the gold standard and smashed up the Bretton Woods monetary system in the summer of 1971.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/money/2025/12/23/TELEMMGLPICT000453997965_17664987410050_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqUAa5Q-50pS4OZaLPIQPvsRWmn_S0fKyxy_Opkm8GcNU.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-12-29 10:14:51.433638

Minoura has acted as a senior advisor to Barclays’ investment banking business in Japan since July 2024, where he has been involved in strategic planning and client engagement.

He brings more than four decades of experience in financial services to the role.

Prior to joining Barclays, Minoura held senior advisory and chair positions at Bank of America Securities Japan, where his responsibilities centred on client coverage and business development.

Earlier in his career, he spent 37 years at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, serving in several senior roles in Japan and overseas, including vice chairman and deputy president.

(“Halda”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a proprietary Regulated Induced Proximity TArgeting Chimera (RIPTAC™) platform to develop oral, targeted therapies for multiple types of solid tumors, including prostate cancer, for $3.05 billion in cash.

“This strategic milestone underscores our commitment to redefining cancer treatment with breakthrough science and transformative medicines,” said Jennifer Taubert, Executive Vice President, Worldwide Chairman, Innovative Medicine, Johnson & Johnson. “We are excited to formally welcome the talented Halda team to Johnson & Johnson and look forward to working together to achieve our shared goal of eliminating cancer.”

With this acquisition, Johnson & Johnson adds HLD-0915, a clinical-stage therapy for prostate cancer, building on the Company’s nearly two decades of innovation in this disease area. HLD-0915 is a once-daily oral therapy that uses a novel RIPTAC™ platform with a precision cancer cell-killing approach that can overcome mechanisms of resistance to treatment. Additionally, the Company adds several earlier candidates for breast, lung and multiple other tumor types, based on RIPTAC™ technology, to its leading oncology portfolio. The novel technology may also enable the creation of transformative targeted therapies beyond oncology.

“Johnson & Johnson continuously seeks new ways to meet patient needs and deliver innovative therapies,” said John C. Reed, M.D., Ph.D., Executive Vice President, Innovative Medicine, R&D, Johnson & Johnson. “Now that we have finalized this acquisition, we will focus on advancing the potential of this promising pipeline of novel product candidates and harnessing the powerful RIPTAC™ platform to discover more molecules in oncology and beyond.”

The acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination. With the transaction now closing in 2025, Johnson & Johnson expects dilution in Q4 2025 and 2026 earnings. The total dilution to Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of approximately $0.20 is expected to split equally between 2025 and 2026 based on the latest estimates for the non-recurring charge related to Halda employee equity awards, financing and integration costs. Johnson & Johnson will provide commentary on full year 2026 guidance during the fourth quarter earnings call on Wednesday, January 21, 2026.

Summary

Global equities rose sharply on the back of strong corporate earnings, continued strength in spending on AI, and a dovish shift in U.S. monetary policy.

For the third quarter, the fund had a positive return but underperformed the benchmark index.

The fund's biggest individual relative detractor was Constellation Software, Inc., a Canada-based software company.

Within this positioning, we continue to lean into what we believe are high-quality, durable growth names.

As of September 30, the fund's largest sector overweight was in financials and communication services, while the fund was most underweight in information technology and industrials.

GOIGX underperformed primarily due to unfavorable security selection in consumer discretionary, IT, and materials, partially offset by communication services and financials.

The fund is overweight financials and communication services, underweight IT and industrials, with regional overweights in the UK and Japan, and underweights in developed Asia-Pacific (ex-Japan) and emerging markets.

GOIGX maintains an equal-weight exposure to quality, capital return, growth, and valuation upside, leaning into high-quality, durable growth names as policy-driven uncertainty eases.

Only the people on the list can be matched, with scans of people who do not match being deleted within seconds, and not stored, according to police.

DCS Craig Kirby, head of crime and intelligence for the force, said the technology would help give police “the very best opportunity to keep the public safe, protect vulnerable people and bring offenders to justice”.

The RLUSD stablecoin has been approved for use across Africa to provide faster, cheaper, and easier access to the US Dollar. Furthermore, the token allows businesses and individuals to hold digital dollars safely. Once assets are tokenized through RLUSD, African users gain access to US market assets. Hence, this development aims to simplify payments, reduce costs, and support cross-border trade across the continent.

RLUSD Overview and Regulatory Framework

RLUSD is pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar and backed by cash and US Treasuries. The Bank of New York Mellon acts as the custodian for the reserves. The stablecoin is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services, ensuring compliance and transparency. Monthly third-party audits confirm that all tokens are fully backed. RLUSD operates on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains, increasing access to liquidity and financial applications.

The stablecoin achieved over $700 million in market capitalization within months of launch. Its regulatory framework makes it suitable for businesses and financial institutions in Africa. Additionally, Jack McDonald, SVP of Stablecoins at Ripple, said RLUSD is now used in payments, tokenization, and trading collateral. This structure provides predictability for cross-border operations.

Addressing Payment Challenges and Currency Stability

Cross-border payments in Africa often have high fees exceeding 8%, causing delays for families and businesses. RLUSD transactions settle within seconds, offering a faster alternative to traditional banking systems. The token also reduces the cost of sending remittances, which is essential for households relying on international transfers.

Currency instability in countries like Nigeria makes holding digital dollars appealing. Local currencies can fluctuate, eroding purchasing power. RLUSD provides a stable store of value, allowing businesses and individuals to plan expenses more efficiently. Thus, this stability supports SMEs in maintaining consistent salaries and supplier payments.

Integration with African Financial Platforms

Platforms such as Chipper Cash, Yellow Card, and VALR have integrated RLUSD into their systems. This enables businesses and individuals to access digital dollars directly through existing platforms. Consequently, the adoption facilitates treasury management, cross-border payments, and digital trading.

Chris Maurice, CEO of Yellow Card, noted that customers require stable digital assets for secure cross-border payments and financial operations. Essentially, RLUSD’s compliance with NYDFS standards ensures trust and transparency. These integrations also expand access to tokenized US market assets through RLUSD.

Use Cases Across Businesses and Commerce

RLUSD is being used for SME treasury management to protect against currency volatility. Businesses can hold reserves in digital dollars and manage budgets effectively. Nonetheless, merchant payments and e-commerce platforms also use RLUSD for international transactions.

The stablecoin is applied in tokenized asset trading and insurance programs. For example, Mercy Corps Ventures used RLUSD to automate climate insurance payouts in Kenya. Subsequently, fast, low-cost transactions make RLUSD practical for both enterprises and individuals. These features make it easier to conduct trade and manage financial operations across Africa.",https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ripple_Eyes_19_Trillion_Tokenization_Boom_as_Institutional_Adoption-2-600x411-1.png,N,,2025-12-29 05:59:32.375171

Motorsport content that performed well in 2025 didn’t try to be everything to everyone; it spoke clearly to those who cared about performance, engineering, and ambition.","Authored By Omkar Rane, Founder, United Motorsports Academy & D&O Motorsports

For decades, motorsport in India lived on the fringes of mainstream culture. It was admired for its speed and spectacle, but rarely understood, marketed, or positioned as part of everyday aspiration. In 2025, that began to change. Not because motorsport suddenly became louder, but because it became more visible, more human, and more relatable.

What shifted this year was not just participation, but perception. Motorsport started to move from being a technically dense, insider-driven space to one that intersected with lifestyle, youth culture, and modern storytelling. And that shift offers important lessons for marketers and brand builders far beyond racing.

One of the biggest changes in 2025 was how motorsport narratives were told. Instead of focusing only on machines and lap times, the spotlight expanded to include people, preparation, pressure, and purpose. Engineers, data analysts, pit crews, and young aspirants became part of the story. This made motorsport easier to understand and emotionally invest in, even for audiences who may never attend a race.

From a marketing perspective, this reflects a broader trend we’ve seen across categories: credibility now comes from access, not exaggeration. Audiences are far more interested in how something works, who it impacts, and what it takes to succeed, rather than being sold perfection. Motorsport, by nature, is imperfect, intense, and unpredictable and leaning into that reality has made it more engaging.

Digital platforms played a critical role in this evolution. Short-form video, behind-the-scenes content, creator-led storytelling, and community-driven conversations helped motorsport reach audiences it had previously missed. Importantly, this wasn’t about mass reach alone. It was about relevance. Motorsport content that performed well in 2025 didn’t try to be everything to everyone; it spoke clearly to those who cared about performance, engineering, and ambition.

Another important shift was experiential storytelling. Motorsport is not a product you can fully explain through ads or visuals alone it needs to be experienced. In 2025, we saw growing interest in on-ground exposure, immersive learning, and real-world engagement. From a brand perspective, this reinforces a simple truth: experiences build trust faster than campaigns. When people see effort, discipline, and pressure up close, they connect more deeply.

This insight extends naturally to education and skill-building ecosystems within motorsport. Over the past year, I’ve seen first-hand how young engineers and professionals respond when communication moves away from promise and toward proof. When the narrative focuses on real environments, real expectations, and real outcomes, it attracts serious intent. Initiatives like intensive bootcamps and global exposure models quietly gained traction in 2025 not because they were marketed aggressively, but because they aligned with what aspirational audiences actually value: authenticity and accountability.

For marketers, there’s a lesson here. High-performance categories don’t need louder messaging; they need clearer positioning. Motorsport’s growing visibility in 2025 came from narrowing the narrative, not broadening it. It spoke confidently about what it is and just as importantly, what it is not. That clarity helped it find its audience.

As we look toward 2026, the expectations will only rise. Audiences are becoming more discerning, and surface-level storytelling will struggle to hold attention. For motorsport and brands operating in similarly complex spaces the focus will need to shift toward depth. That means investing in content that educates without overwhelming, inspires without exaggeration, and invites participation rather than passive consumption.

We will also see stronger overlap between motorsport, mobility, and innovation narratives. As electric vehicles, data-driven performance, and advanced engineering become more central to everyday life, motorsport’s relevance will expand. This creates an opportunity for brands and institutions to position themselves not just as participants in a sport, but as contributors to a broader culture of performance and progress.

Ultimately, what 2025 showed us is that visibility is no longer about volume it’s about value. Motorsport found its moment not by chasing attention, but by earning it. If 2026 builds on that foundation with sharper storytelling, honest communication, and meaningful experiences, motorsport’s place in India’s cultural and brand landscape will only continue to grow.

And for marketers watching closely, the message is clear: when you respect your audience’s intelligence and invite them closer to the process, aspiration follows naturally.",https://erp.adgully.com/artical_image/3783142d3ba6812c29db70d28095b79d.jpeg,N,,2025-12-29 11:01:53.902430

Who will hit a $5 trillion market cap next? - Quartz,"Catherine Baab, qz.com",,,,,https://qz.com/nvidia-microsoft-apple-google-tesla-meta-market-cap,"It was a landmark year for corporate valuations, especially among the world’s most famous tech companies.

It may seem tautological, but the tech companies that have recently crossed into or flirted with a $4 trillion market cap are the most obvious candidates to hit the $5 trillion mark.","It was a landmark year for corporate valuations, especially among the world’s most famous tech companies.

Market cap milestones once considered mythical — $1 trillion, $2 trillion, $3 trillion, etc. — are now routine financial news. On one side, they’ve been driven by explosive growth in consumer tech, cloud computing, and AI; on the other, by simply massive inflows of capital from ETFs, money managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and the global investor class.

Of course, the sheer most eye-catching headline has already been written. In October 2025, Nvidia became the first publicly traded company to surpass a $5 trillion market valuation, propelled by its central role in powering AI workloads and tremendous demand for its chips. The achievement cements Nvidia’s role as a heavyweight of the current mega-cap era — a status that just a few years ago seemed out of reach for any hardware business.

Before we look at which company is likely to be the next in the race to the $5 trillion mark, let’s review who reached the $4 trillion threshold in 2025.

The $4 trillion club

Microsoft passed the $4 trillion threshold in the middle of the year, powered by accelerating cloud and AI services growth and strong enterprise demand for its AI-integrated software platforms. Apple also rose above $4 trillion late in the year — the third company in history to do so — on the back of device sales and services revenue. Late in the year, Google parent Alphabet briefly brushed the $4 trillion market cap mark, too.

Considered together with Nvidia, these four companies represent the frontier of size in the global stock market, occupying a tremendous chunk of market-cap-weighted indices.

What about the rest of the Magnificent Seven? Amazon, smaller than the very largest four, derives much of its $2.4 trillion valuation from Amazon Web Services and long-term bets in logistics and AI-driven commerce. But the stock lagged behind its Big Tech peers in 2025, moving sideways so that it’s set to finish the year with low single-digit gains.

Meanwhile, even sitting below the $2 trillion mark, Tesla, Meta, and the semiconductor and hardware maker Broadcom remain firmly in the upper tier of global market caps.

Who will be the next to $5 trillion?

It may seem tautological, but the tech companies that have recently crossed into or flirted with a $4 trillion market cap are the most obvious candidates to hit the $5 trillion mark.

Thus, Microsoft — with its vast cloud business, deep enterprise software penetration, and increasing AI integration — may be the most obvious of any contender. Continued multiple expansion alongside consistent earnings growth are likely to steadily push the stock higher. Ditto Apple. Its ecosystem generates enormous recurring revenue from services and hardware, and its ventures into AI-enhanced products could, at least in theory, prove to be future growth catalysts. If innovation accelerates in ways that reenergize — or simply meet? — investor expectations, hitting $5 trillion is within the realm of possibility.

It's a similar story with Alphabet’s strength in AI, plus its core business in search, YouTube, Android, and everything cloud. Few companies on earth boast such broad and defensible franchises. And as the investor story catches up, the company could break out to emerge as an even bigger winner.

Why scale begets scale

In the past, investor logic — invoking “trees don’t grow to the sky” and a loose reading of the law of large numbers — cast mega-caps as destined for slower growth. But the 2010s and 2020s turned that longstanding wisdom on its head, and a fresh reversal doesn’t look likely.

It’s simple. As companies reach multi-trillion-dollar valuations, index weight, passive ownership, and benchmark dominance don’t just reflect success — they arguably help to perpetuate it, making further gains more likely. Earnings still matter, yet they’re also amplified by the structure of contemporary capital markets.

The logic may feel circular, but new $5 trillion behemoths rarely emerge out of nowhere. The next entrant is far more likely to come from the ranks of the giants than from anywhere else.","https://qz.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=300,quality=85,format=auto/https://assets.qz.com/media/GettyImages-2247717778.jpg",N,,2025-12-29 06:14:41.609577

What was once framed as a speculative or alternative asset class is now being discussed as core financial infrastructure, with direct implications for sustainable finance, capital efficiency, and long-term market resilience. Despite its continued growth, ADFW maintained a high signal-to-noise ratio, reinforcing Abu Dhabi’s role as a jurisdiction capable of scaling global finance conversations without diluting substance.

Digital assets featured prominently across both Asset Management and Fintech tracks, reflecting their transition from niche innovation to foundational market infrastructure. Institutional participants—including family offices, sovereign investors, and asset managers—no longer questioned whether digital assets belong in portfolios. Instead, discussions focused on how regulated digital infrastructure can improve transparency, liquidity, and capital allocation efficiency, all of which are central pillars of sustainable finance.

Demographic change and regulatory clarity are accelerating this transition. Younger generations are increasingly comfortable operating within digital-native financial environments, while jurisdictions such as Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) have provided the regulatory certainty required for institutional participation. At the same time, validation from major global financial institutions has reframed digital assets as a strategic necessity rather than an optional allocation. For sovereign wealth funds managing intergenerational capital, failing to engage with digital-native financial systems is increasingly viewed as a long-term fiduciary risk.

Tokenization emerged as one of the most consequential themes at ADFW, no longer treated as an experimental concept but as a practical evolution of capital markets infrastructure. Institutional focus is shifting toward tokenized equities, fixed income, and on-chain capital markets that enable continuous trading, faster settlement, and improved capital mobility. The growing adoption of stablecoins and regulated custody frameworks is reinforcing institutional confidence, allowing blockchain-based markets to operate within familiar risk, compliance, and governance structures.

While regulatory progress has been significant, institutional knowledge gaps remain the primary constraint on adoption, particularly among mid-sized banks and financial institutions. Many organizations lack internal mandates or specialized expertise to deploy digital asset strategies at scale. However, this gap is closing rapidly as competitive pressure from early movers intensifies. Market participants increasingly expect accelerated hiring, strategic partnerships, and consolidation, with traditional financial institutions acquiring digital infrastructure and capabilities rather than building them internally.

During the ADFW panel “Mapping Asset Allocation: Making Sense of Modern Portfolios,” the discussion highlighted a clear shift in how institutional investors are approaching digital assets—not as speculative outliers, but as components of modern portfolio construction. Speaking alongside Fai Hung Ma Co-Founder & Global CIO at GROW Investment Group, Stephen Shaya Managing Director at Akkad Holdings, Ali Sabanci Chairperson at ESAS Holding, and moderated by Yasmin Elmousthey Managing Director at Beacon Hills, XBTO’s Chief Commercial Officer, Karl Naim met with ESG News to offer a practitioner’s perspective on how institutional-grade digital infrastructure is converging with traditional investment disciplines.

In a post-event interview, Karl Naïm, Chief Commercial Officer at XBTO, commented: “As digital asset markets mature and volatility compresses over time, firms like ours have been focusing on active strategies designed to generate alpha—mirroring the evolution of traditional hedge fund markets,” Naim said. “Tokenized private debt issuance and increasing demand for Bitcoin yield solutions combined with regulated custody offerings further demonstrate how digital assets are becoming embedded within mainstream capital markets and part of corporate treasury conversations, rather than operating at their margins.”

From a sustainable finance perspective, the implications of this shift are material. Digital market infrastructure enables more efficient capital allocation, broader access to private and emerging assets through tokenization, and reduced friction and settlement risk across financial systems. These structural improvements strengthen market resilience and support longer-term investment horizons aligned with sustainability objectives.

ADFW 2025 reinforced Abu Dhabi’s position as a global hub for sustainable financial infrastructure, combining regulatory certainty, sovereign capital, and long-term policy alignment. As digital assets move from experimentation to execution, Abu Dhabi is increasingly where institutional finance and digital infrastructure converge at scale. For ESG News, the signal is clear: sustainable finance is no longer defined solely by disclosures or frameworks, but by the infrastructure that enables capital to move efficiently, transparently, and globally.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ADFW-Panel-Fai-Hung-Ma-Stephen-Shaya-Ali-Sabanci-Karl-Naim-Yasmin-ElmoustheyJPG-1024x683.png,N,,2025-12-29 11:14:02.545011

Fast growth brings new dangers According to Altman, AI models have improved at an extraordinary speed over the last year.
In response to these growing risks, OpenAI has announced plans to hire a Head of Preparedness.
As AI systems become more conversational and emotionally responsive, concerns have grown about people becoming overly dependent on them.
OpenAI believes this kind of structured oversight is essential as AI systems become more autonomous and capable of complex reasoning.","Artificial intelligence has long been seen as a game-changer, promising to make work easier, boost research, and improve everyday life. From helping people write emails to solving complex technical problems, AI tools are becoming smarter by the day. But now, a rare warning has come from within the tech industry itself. OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman has admitted that advanced AI agents are starting to pose serious real-world risks, especially around security, misuse, and their impact on people.

In a recent post on the social media platform X, owned by Elon Musk, Altman said AI systems are entering a more dangerous phase. While companies have become better at measuring how powerful AI models are, understanding how those powers could be misused is becoming much harder.

Altman explained that the industry is moving into unfamiliar territory. “We have a strong foundation of measuring growing capabilities, but we are entering a world where we need a more nuanced understanding of how those capabilities could be abused,” he wrote. He added that limiting the risks without blocking the benefits is a tough challenge, mainly because there are very few past examples to learn from.

Fast growth brings new dangers

According to Altman, AI models have improved at an extraordinary speed over the last year. Many of them can already perform tasks that once required trained professionals, such as coding, analysing systems, and solving technical problems. But this rapid growth has also brought new risks. AI agents are no longer just tools that follow instructions. In some cases, they can act more independently, which makes them attractive to attackers. One of the biggest worries is cybersecurity. Altman revealed that AI systems are now becoming skilled enough to spot serious software weaknesses.

While this ability can help companies fix security flaws faster, it can also be misused. If the same tools fall into the wrong hands, they could be used to break into systems more easily and at a much larger scale. “We are seeing models become good enough at computer security that they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities,” Altman said.

This signals a major change in how AI threats are viewed. AI is no longer just a support tool. It can actively search for weaknesses, making cyberattacks quicker, cheaper, and harder to stop.

AI-driven hacking is already happening

Altman’s warning comes at a time when concerns about AI-powered cybercrime are rising around the world. Recently, AI company Anthropic revealed that its Claude Code tool had been misused by Chinese state-sponsored hackers. The attackers reportedly targeted around 30 organisations, including technology firms, banks, and government bodies. What worried experts most was how little human involvement was needed. Much of the attack process was automated, showing how AI agents can make sophisticated hacking easier than ever before. Cybersecurity experts warn that traditional defence systems, which are designed to respond to human-led attacks, may struggle to keep up with this new reality.

In response to these growing risks, OpenAI has announced plans to hire a Head of Preparedness. This senior role will focus on managing the dangers linked to advanced AI systems. Altman said the move is part of a broader effort to ensure that safety keeps pace with innovation. The Head of Preparedness will lead OpenAI’s internal framework to identify, assess, and reduce risks from powerful AI models. The job will include evaluating what AI systems can do, building threat models, and ensuring safety measures are strong enough to handle future challenges. The role will also involve close coordination across research, engineering, policy, and governance teams. OpenAI has stressed that safety cannot be treated as an afterthought and must be built into products from the start. Importantly, this role will help decide when and how new AI capabilities are released, especially if there is a risk of misuse.

Concerns go beyond cybersecurity

Altman also pointed out that the risks of AI are not limited to hacking and digital security. He said OpenAI had already noticed early signs of mental health risks linked to AI interactions as far back as 2025. As AI systems become more conversational and emotionally responsive, concerns have grown about people becoming overly dependent on them.

At the same time, AI chatbots have faced lawsuits and criticism over misinformation. Several reports have accused AI systems of confidently producing incorrect or misleading information, making it harder for users to know what is true. These problems highlight a bigger challenge. As AI becomes more human-like and persuasive, its influence on people’s thoughts, emotions, and behaviour becomes harder to predict and control.

OpenAI has said the new Head of Preparedness will pay special attention to high-risk areas such as cybersecurity and biological risks. In these fields, misuse of advanced AI could have serious real-world consequences. The role will also involve working with external partners and internal safety teams to ensure that risk evaluations stay relevant as technology evolves. OpenAI believes this kind of structured oversight is essential as AI systems become more autonomous and capable of complex reasoning. Altman described the role as demanding, involving difficult decisions in a fast-moving and uncertain environment. Candidates are expected to have strong technical backgrounds in AI safety, security, or threat modelling, along with the ability to balance long-term risks with rapid product development.",https://etedge-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/sam-altman.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 07:13:23.908790

≡ BANKRUPTCY UPDATE ≡

“The Debtor does not have sufficient available sources of working capital and/or financing to operate its business or maintain its property in the ordinary course of business without the DIP [debtor-in-possession] Facility and authorized use of Cash Collateral.”

That’s the situation in which Grand Slam Track finds itself, as noted in the 23 December 2025 Order issued by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Delaware. In a 21 December filing, the Chief Restructuring Officer, Nicholas Rubin, noted its financial situation, requiring a rescue loan:

● $143,126 in cash on hand

● $31.4 million in debt

● $5.3 million in secured debt to Winners Alliance

● $6.1 million in unsecured debt to Winners Alliance

● $7.0 million owed to athletes

● $13.0 million owed to suppliers and vendors

Winners Alliance is the commercial – for-profit – arm of the Professional Tennis Players Association, and was the primary funder of Grand Slam Track. It provided $13 million in start-up capital in return for equity in the venture in April 2024. According to the Rubin filing:

“The Company therefore retained PJT Partners (“PJT”) to conduct a formal capitalraising and strategic outreach process. The engagement contemplated a broad-based market check, including outreach to strategic investors, family offices, private equity sponsors, venture capital firms, and new entrants to the sports and entertainment investment space. Between January 2025 and March 2025, PJT contacted more than 150 potential investors on behalf of the Company and facilitated extensive diligence and management engagement, including the distribution of marketing and diligence materials, provision of data room access, and coordination of live management presentations.

“During this period, members of the Company’s management participated in more than 30 live pitch meetings with prospective investors, addressing topics including the planned structure of the inaugural 2025 season, projected operating results, capital requirements, and potential paths to scalability. Despite this extensive outreach, many prospective investors declined to proceed or deferred investment decisions, frequently citing the early-stage nature of the league, the absence of completed operating results from a full season of competition, uncertainty regarding the ramp-up of media and sponsorship revenues, and the lack of a committed lead investor.”

In March 2025, possible investor Eldridge Industries decided to wait on committing to Grand Slam Track until seeing the first meet in Kingston, Jamaica on 4-6 April, and thereafter declined to participate. That caused the financial collapse of Grand Slam Track.

The recap noted that the three meets in Jamaica, Miramar, Florida and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sold a total of 64,566 tickets with “merchandise sell-outs at each event.”

Winners Alliance continues to have faith in the concept, and in the 23 December Order, will provide further loans of up to $3.25 million, and will have first call on repayment. The loans are being made at a quite-sharp interest rate of 14.5%.

But that $3.25 million will not go to pay off vendors and suppliers, or for most of the athlete expenses. It costs money to be in bankruptcy and the Order included a 13-week budget from 19 December 2025 to 20 March 2026 of $3.03 million:

● $1.58 million in operating expenses

● $1.45 million of restructuring expenses

The operating expenses include $421,643 in salaries and does include $200,000 for “Racer Contract Guarantees,” about 2.9% of the remaining debts to athletes.

The next major step comes in January, per the loan agreement:

“On or before January 30, 2026, Borrower shall have filed a Disclosure Statement and a proposed Chapter 11 Plan, which shall provide that GST emerges reorganized with Michael Johnson and Stephen Gera remaining as officers of the Reorganized Debtor and be in form and substance acceptable to Lender in its sole discretion.”

Gera, a former Marine who served in Iraq and later worked with teams in the NFL and NBA, joined Grand Slam Track in January 2024 and has served as President and Chief Operating Officer. He and Atlanta 1996 Olympic icon Johnson began discussions about the Grand Slam Track concept in mid-2023.

The loans are due to be repaid, or possibly converted into equity, by 15 April 2026.

Observed: Winners Alliance is willing to spend some more money on Grand Slam Track to see if it can make it pay and is keeping Johnson in charge. It will be an uphill climb, for sure, but the Philadelphia meet showed that there is fan interest.

But Grand Slam Track cannot go forward without paying off its debts, especially to the athletes. That’s the key, and any future ventures are going to require cash-in-advance to athletes and vendors.

AMD wins major Alibaba MI308 chip order to challenge Nvidia H200

AMD is poised to score a rare win against Nvidia in China after reports said Alibaba plans to buy about 40,000 to 50,000 units of AMD's China-specific MI308 AI accelerators, a deal that could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and mark AMD's largest single China transaction since US export controls took effect. The potential order comes as Washington allows both Nvidia and AMD to resume limited AI chip shipments to China in the second half of 2025, reopening competition that had been largely frozen.

While Nvidia has secured approval to reintroduce its H20 and later the more powerful H200, Chinese customers have reportedly cooled on the H20 amid performance concerns and regulatory scrutiny. By contrast, the MI308, which offers higher memory capacity, lower pricing, and no known security objections, is gaining traction as a practical alternative for Chinese cloud and AI workloads. Neither Alibaba nor AMD has confirmed the reported transaction.

SMEE wins China lithography order, yet ASML still controls advanced-node tools

Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) has secured a CNY109 million, or about US$15.5 million, contract to supply a step-and-scan lithography system to a China government-linked buyer, highlighting Beijing's continued push to localize semiconductor equipment under tightening US-led export controls, while underscoring that advanced-node lithography remains firmly beyond domestic reach.

The tool targets mature process nodes between 0.18 microns and 90 nanometers, aligning with demand from automotive, power, industrial, and specialty chip production rather than cutting-edge logic manufacturing. The single-source, policy-driven procurement reflects China's priority on securing a stable supply for mature-node capacity that underpins much of its domestic semiconductor output.

US probes top SEA Nvidia buyer over chip smuggling

US authorities are investigating Singapore-based cloud provider Megaspeed International over concerns that Nvidia chips may have been diverted to China, a case that has drawn political attention as Republican Senator Tom Cotton urges tighter enforcement of US export controls. People familiar with the matter said the probe has not established any violations, and Megaspeed and Nvidia have denied wrongdoing, while regulators in the US, Singapore, and Malaysia say their reviews are ongoing.

Bloomberg's analysis of customs data shows Megaspeed has imported at least US$4.6 billion worth of Nvidia hardware since 2023, including large volumes of current-generation Blackwell chips, and rents computing capacity from data centers outside China to customers that include Chinese firms, a model generally allowed under current rules. US officials are examining Megaspeed's ownership and whether any chips were physically transferred into China without licenses, while Nvidia says repeated site checks found no evidence of diversion.

Samsung, SK Hynix reportedly hike HBM3E prices nearly 20% ahead of 2026 shift

South Korean memory makers Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix have raised prices for fifth-generation high-bandwidth memory by nearly 20% for 2026 deliveries, as demand for AI accelerators continues to outpace supply even as producers shift capacity toward next-generation HBM4, according to industry sources.

The increase for HBM3E chips defies the usual price softening ahead of a generational transition and reflects sustained orders from AI chip designers, including Nvidia, Google, and Amazon, which are preparing higher-memory AI processors for 2026. Continued demand is also being supported by Nvidia's planned resumption of H200 exports to China, which rely on HBM3E rather than HBM4, extending the lifecycle of the current standard.

TSMC's N-2 restrictions give Samsung US advanced chip an opening

Samsung Electronics is positioning itself to capture rising US demand for advanced chips as Taiwan's N-2 policy limits overseas deployment of TSMC's leading-edge processes and much of TSMC's near-term capacity is tied up by Apple and Nvidia, according to industry sources. Samsung has begun sample testing of its second-generation 2nm SF2P process with AMD and is working with Google on potential 2026 production, while its Taylor, Texas, fab is being lined up for 2nm mass manufacturing as early as next year.

By contrast, TSMC plans to reach 3nm volume production at its Arizona Fab 2 in 2027, leaving its US operations at least two generations behind its Taiwan base due to regulatory constraints. With Apple reportedly taking nearly half of TSMC's 2nm output and Nvidia planning to move 2nm production to TSMC starting in 2027, customers such as Qualcomm, AMD, and Google are increasingly evaluating Samsung as an alternative.

Google reportedly fires procurement execs amid HBM supply crunch

Google and Microsoft are intensifying efforts to secure high-bandwidth memory as production capacity at South Korean suppliers tightens, underscoring how AI-driven demand is straining the global memory supply chain, according to industry sources cited by Seoul Economic Daily and G-enews.

Major cloud companies, including Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have stationed procurement teams in South Korea to negotiate supplies of HBM, DRAM, and enterprise solid-state drives from Samsung and SK Hynix, whose advanced memory lines are nearing full utilization. Tensions have emerged as buyers seek long-term commitments that suppliers say they cannot meet, leading to stalled talks and, at Google, the dismissal of procurement executives after the company failed to lock in capacity for its in-house tensor processing units.

Samsung, SK Hynix reportedly accelerate HBM4 production to early 2026

Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are accelerating sixth-generation HBM production to February 2026, moving months ahead of earlier schedules as they race to meet surging demand for AI infrastructure, according to industry sources and South Korean media, including Seoul Economic Daily and TheElec.

The revised timeline positions Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix to become the first suppliers to deliver HBM4 at scale, tightening their grip on the AI memory market before rivals can catch up. SK Hynix plans to start volume wafer input using 1b DRAM at its M16 and M15X facilities, while Samsung is expected to launch full HBM4 production at its Pyeongtaek campus after receiving positive evaluations from Nvidia, according to sources.

“I think our win at UC San Diego was the start of it,” Johnson said recently.
I love how fast we play.” Lavin sees Johnson as the perfect player to run his team.
You have to see it in real time to fully appreciate it.” UC San Diego coach Clint Allard saw it up close.
Tigers update: Senior Justin Rochelin was the Big West Sixth Man of the Year last season while playing for UC San Diego.","University of San Diego opens West Coast Conference play on Sunday against Pacific, and point guard Ty-Laur Johnson predicts the Toreros “will shock some people” before the season’s over.

“I think our win at UC San Diego was the start of it,” Johnson said recently. “We put it together in that game. I think we’ve started to figure each other out. We’re a lot better than people think we are. We just have to prove it.”

Johnson and his teammates certainly showed what they can do on Dec. 19, when they upset UCSD on the Tritons’ home court. Three nights later, however, the Toreros traveled to Washington and were routed 86-56 by the Huskies.

“I’m not saying we’re a finished product,” said Johnson, whose play was instrumental in the victory over UCSD. “But we’re making progress. We’ve gone through a lot of changes and had a lot of injuries. We have a good idea (of) what we can be. And it’s better than what people predicted.”

One reason the Toreros could be better than predicted — and they were projected to finish ninth in the West Coast Conference — is Johnson. The 6-foot point guard came to Alcala Park this year after spending two seasons in the Atlantic Coast Conference – one with Louisville and one with Wake Forest, where he started the final 19 games of the 2024-25 season.

Why would the Brooklyn, N.Y., native leave the ACC for USD, where the Toreros struggled to a 6-27 record last season?

Toreros coach Steve Lavin was the main reason.

“I liked his history of developing and using small guards at UCLA and St. John’s,” Johnson explained. “I wanted to be regarded as more of a leader on and off the court. I wanted to play for a coach who could make the most of what I do.

“I have definitely found a spot here. I’m definitely learning from Coach Lavin. He helps me with a lot of stuff, using my speed to create space, working the pace of the game. I definitely made the right decision. I like it here and having the ball in my hands. I love how fast we play.”

Lavin sees Johnson as the perfect player to run his team.

“The point guard is the basketball equivalent of the central nervous system,” Lavin said. “They are critical to what any team hopes to achieve. Ty-Laur is exceptionally intuitive. He has a feel that is difficult to teach.

“He’s as quick and as fast as any player I’ve ever coached. He gets us out in transition. He plays defense as well as offense. He’s built more like a dancer — wiry, strong and tenacious. You have to see it in real time to fully appreciate it.”

UC San Diego coach Clint Allard saw it up close. And he made note of Johnson’s play — not just the last-second shot that upset the Tritons at home.

“They turned the ball over to Johnson to handle our pressure and he did the job,” Allard said.

Said Lavin: “That game against UC San Diego, it was his combination of speed, quickness and skill and feel for the game that set him apart. It’s the combination. He’s that ideal guard that can influence the game on both ends of the court. While he’s diminutive, the length, his foot speed and instincts … John Wooden once said the two most important things in basketball are quickness and balance. Ty has both.”

Lavin remembers his first contact with Johnson when the guard was in the transfer portal.

“We had conversations,” recalled the coach. “He told me how he saw his game. I remember sending him some clips on small guards I’ve coached, guys like Tyus Edney and Cameron Dollar. It was sending those clips of certain guards so that he could get a sense and a feel for what he might be doing here.”

It hasn’t exactly been smooth sailing for the Toreros. They enter WCC play with a losing record. They were crushed by San Diego State in an exhibition and again last week at Washington. Nine Toreros, including Johnson, have missed practice time or games due to injuries or sickness.

“The adjustment is hard, but not that hard,” Johnson said. “One thing that made it harder is that we had so many new players (eight transfers and five promising freshmen). … “Once you start practicing, you learn tendencies. I think we’re still figuring it out, but it’s coming together. It’s hard to get to know somebody when they’re out injured.

“I feel my team is unpredictable. When we are hot, we’re hot. We can shoot. We have to get more consistent. I think it’s just a matter of time. We improve every day. I think we’re only about 70% of what we can be.”

Said Lavin: “We’re seeing signs of what we can be.”

“It started with a great first half against USC. The difference in that game was their 18-2 run early in the second half. That, and Johnson lost some critical time with foul concerns.

“But we talk a lot about orchestrating where we’re ahead. I think we’re headed in the right direction. The Washington game was a learning experience. And this is a group that’s evolving into a different team than what it was when we first came together. Our upside is intriguing.”

And Johnson?

“He knows,” Lavin said, “and does.”

USD vs. Pacific

When: 3 p.m. Sunday

Where: Jenny Craig Pavilion

On the air: ESPN+

Records: Pacific is 9-4. USD is 5-7

Last time out: Three days after upsetting crosstown rival UC San Diego 82-80 on Ty-Laur Johnson’s last-second 3-pointer, the Toreros lost 86-56 at Washington. Guards Juanse Gorosito and Adrian McIntyre each scored 15 points for the Toreros while going a combined 13 for 21 from the floor. USD was outrebounded 46-28, with the Huskies having a 22-6 edge in second-chance points and a 44-16 advantage on points in the paint.

Series history: Pacific leads the all-time series, 17-12. But USD has won three of the last four meetings under head coach Steve Lavin and went 2-1 against the Tigers last year, including a win in the first round of the West Coast Conference Tournament.

Toreros update: Lavin has used the same starting lineup the past two games – Johnson, Gorosito and McIntyre at the guards and Vuk Boskovic and freshman Alejandro Aviles on the front line. Due to injuries or illness, only five Toreros have played in all 12 games and only Boskovic has started as many as 10. Twelve different Toreros have started. Johnson leads USD with an average of 12.9 points per game. He, Toneari Lane (10.7), Gorosito (10.3) and McIntyre (8.8) are USD’s four leading scorers.

Tigers update: Senior Justin Rochelin was the Big West Sixth Man of the Year last season while playing for UC San Diego. The 6-foot-5 guard has started all 13 games for UOP, averaging 6.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game. Forward Elias Ralph leads the Tigers with 17.1 points and 6.2 rebounds per game while shooting 41.3% from 3-point range. Guard T.J. Wainwright (13.2 ppg) and forward Isaac Jack (9.6 ppg, 6.2 rpg) are major contributors.

Next up: USD will host No. 7 Gonzaga on Tuesday at 6:30 p.m. at the Jenny Craig Pavilion.

The appeals process has become a parallel assessment system, in which new evidence is routinely introduced, and eligibility is effectively re-determined.
Biennial reviews of PIP and Work Capability Assessment criteria to ensure eligibility reflects modern society, technology, and additional costs.
A joint DWP–HM Courts & Tribunals Service case management system to improve transparency, performance monitoring, and accountability.
We need to restore parliamentary authority, improve accountability, and use technology to deliver a fairer, more sustainable system.”","This new report by Policy Exchange shines a light on an often overlooked part of the welfare system: the appeals process for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). It argues that we need to fundamentally reform our appeals process for health and disability benefits to raise decision-making quality, improve democratic accountability and ensure the support provided is both sustainable and targeted appropriately.

We have a system where more than 300,000 young people are currently supported by out-of-work benefits that carry no work-search requirement. This is around double the number five years ago. More than 3.9 million people now claim PIP, with over 1,000 people making a claim to PIP. Forecasts now show that one in eight people will claim a disability benefit by 2030.

The report demonstrates that these benefits are increasingly shaped by judicial reinterpretation rather than clear parliamentary intent. Over time, this has allowed the practical boundaries of eligibility to expand. The appeals process has become a parallel assessment system, in which new evidence is routinely introduced, and eligibility is effectively re-determined. At the same time, fragmented accountability across the Department for Work and Pensions, the Ministry of Justice and HM Treasury has weakened incentives to improve decision-making.

Key recommendations

The report calls for a reset of the appeals system, including:

Fundamental reform of Mandatory Reconsideration, transferring it from the DWP to the Ministry of Justice and empowering judicial caseworkers to correct errors, order fresh assessments, and use machine learning tools to improve consistency and quality.

Biennial reviews of PIP and Work Capability Assessment criteria to ensure eligibility reflects modern society, technology, and additional costs.

Granting the Upper Tribunal the power to issue suspended remedies, forcing Parliament to actively respond to landmark rulings.

A joint DWP–HM Courts & Tribunals Service case management system to improve transparency, performance monitoring, and accountability.

Moving Social Security Tribunals to a “virtual by default” model, with safeguards for digitally excluded claimants.

Reforming tribunal interpretation services so that foreign-language interpretation is ordinarily funded by appellants (with appropriate exemptions for BSL).

In a foreword to the report, Sir Robert Buckland, former Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, warns that Parliament has allowed responsibility for welfare eligibility to drift from lawmakers to the judiciary: “Parliament must end its practice of legislating on eligibility criteria in a vague and undefined way and reclaim responsibility from the courts. The scale of discretion that has been subcontracted to judges should concern all of us who care about the proper role of the justice system.”

The report author, Jean-André Prager, remarked: “The appeals system has become a substitute for good decision-making rather than a check on it. This report argues for a reset. We need to restore parliamentary authority, improve accountability, and use technology to deliver a fairer, more sustainable system.”",https://policyexchange.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Social-Cover-50-1024x558.png,N,,2025-12-28 18:59:02.909105

Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max have also continued to add customers this year.
Media giants must walk a tightrope between pleasing Wall Street and pushing consumers toward free streamers, or apps like Instagram and TikTok.","YouTube and other free ad-supported services, such as The Roku Channel and Fox-owned Tubi, have become increasingly popular over the last two years, according to Nielsen's viewership data.

""For consumers, cost sensitivity is often a more important deciding factor than user experience,"" said Brandon Katz, a media analyst at entertainment data provider Greenlight Analytics. ""Saving money outweighs the annoyance of terrible insurance commercials.""

As these free streamers eat up a larger chunk of viewership time on US smart TVs, they may be holding back the growth of services like Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max.

ADVERTISEMENT

Free-to-access services YouTube, Tubi, and The Roku Channel have grown their viewership by 53% from December 2023 through November, according to a Business Insider analysis of Nielsen data. Those three free streamers make up nearly 18% of all watch time on US TVs, and that doesn't include Paramount's Pluto TV, which Nielsen broke out individually until March.

In that span, major paid streamers' collective watch time is only up 5%. That includes Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Hulu, Peacock, and HBO Max, formerly known as Max. (Paramount+ was included until March, when Nielsen stopped reporting its individual share. And HBO Max's viewership includes sister streamer Discovery+.)

That means free streamers are growing more than 10 times faster than their paid counterparts, though the bulk of that growth is driven by YouTube, which has become a force in Hollywood.

ADVERTISEMENT

Slower engagement growth is a troubling sign for paid streamers. Viewership is positively tied to pricing power and inversely correlated with cancellations, meaning that people who watch a streamer more often are less likely to cancel.

""Engagement drives churn down,"" said Hernan Lopez, founder of media consulting firm Owl & Co.

""It's not just about hours spent,"" he added, but also the frequency that viewers return to an app and the breadth of content that they watch.

Engaged streaming subscribers are also usually more receptive to price hikes, Katz said, since they likely place a higher value on the service than inactive users.

ADVERTISEMENT

""The goal is to offer customers enough attractive content that opening the app becomes a regular occurrence,"" Katz said. ""At that habitual usage point, streamers are able to reasonably raise prices without fear of a mass exodus of customers.""

For customers on ad-supported plans, higher engagement also translates to more ad revenue.

It's not all bad news for paid streamers. Streaming is an increasingly profitable business, thanks in large part to price hikes, which every major service (except for Prime Video) has implemented or announced in the past 12 months.

Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max have also continued to add customers this year. However, Peacock hasn't grown its subscriber base since the first quarter of 2025, and Netflix no longer reports its subscriber count on a quarterly basis.

The large gap between free and paid streamer viewership growth rates suggests that so-called stream-flation could be taking a toll. Media giants must walk a tightrope between pleasing Wall Street and pushing consumers toward free streamers, or apps like Instagram and TikTok.

Streaming giants Netflix and Disney each have creative ideas for driving engagement in 2026.

Netflix is turning to video podcasts in hopes of adding lean-back content that keeps subscribers engaged throughout the day. It's also been trying to use games as a way to create daily habits among its users.

Disney is taking a different tack by betting on AI-generated video through a new partnership with OpenAI. This AI initiative will enable fans to create short clips of Disney characters, such as Mickey Mouse or Darth Vader, eventually within the Disney+ app.",https://ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/sHFktkuTURBXy85YWUyNzJhNS1kNTg1LTQ5NWUtYTc1MS00YTY1NzlmZjVmZmYuanBlZ5GTBc0EsM0Cdg,N,,2025-12-28 17:59:44.674757

“You’re probably going to go online, research it a little bit,” Jensen said, outlining the typical shopper journey.
Best Buy leveraged laptop consumer data to identify “upgrade readiness signals” to see which consumers would be interested in using Microsoft’s AI tool.
“We don’t want to just be in retail media,” Jensen said.
We’re a retailer and a media company.","RANCHO PALOS VERDES, CALIF. — Best Buy can tie almost all its transactions back to individual customers, an ability the company considers market leading that’s based on precise measurement and attribution across the complex consumer electronics purchase path.

“We have a 93% revenue identification rate. So what that means is 93% of our transactions we can tie back to a customer and that’s pretty compelling — and that’s market leading,” Jen Jensen, VP of Agency Partnerships for Best Buy Ads, told Beet.TV contributor David Kaplan at the Beet Retreat LA.

Combined with eight million paid loyalty members and database coverage reaching 80% of the U.S. population, this identification capability provides a measurement foundation that Jensen said separates Best Buy from competitors facing lower match rates.

Where research happens

Consumer electronics purchases involve extended consideration periods with repeated movement between online research, in-store evaluation, and final transaction channels, creating measurement complexity that Best Buy’s data infrastructure addresses.

“You’re probably going to go online, research it a little bit,” Jensen said, outlining the typical shopper journey. “You’re going to compare brands. Then you’re probably going to go into a Best Buy store. You want to feel it, you want to engage with it, you want to probably talk to a blue shirt, ask questions. You might buy it there, or you might say, ‘I’m going to go back online, do a little bit more research.’”

About 45% of customers return to Best Buy stores for pickup after online purchase, creating touchpoints that inform attribution models spanning weeks or months of consideration.

Microsoft Copilot takes off

Jensen pointed to campaign partnership with Microsoft to promote the software giant’s AI platform Copilot. Best Buy leveraged laptop consumer data to identify “upgrade readiness signals” to see which consumers would be interested in using Microsoft’s AI tool.

“We were kind of digging in and understanding when they are ready to upgrade? What are the use cases that will get them to upgrade?” Jensen said. “We built a pretty cool campaign that we brought to about nine brands. They all wanted in because they wanted to say the consumer was ready to upgrade to this new technology.”

Closing the loop with CTV

Best Buy’s work with over-the-top TV platform Roku combined first-party data precision with connected TV brand-building capabilities and emerging formats like buy-now buttons that bridge awareness and conversion.

“When you think of that plus a partner like Roku, for us, that’s really important because you can really precisely target. Then you can also have closed loop reporting, which we know everybody wants,” Jensen said.

The integration enables simultaneous brand storytelling and performance demonstration through formats that didn’t exist in traditional television advertising.

AI optimizes across Google ecosystem

Google’s Performance Max product enables optimization across the company’s entire product portfolio while leveraging Best Buy’s first-party data, creating more performant media through automated allocation.

Best Buy is also deploying AI within its app to create custom experiences, serving relevant laptop content and advertising simultaneously when customers shop specific categories.

“You can have more dynamic creative, you can have more relevance for the customer. You just get to better performance and then you can scale it much faster,” Jensen said.

Media company ambitions

Best Buy positions itself as a media company and retailer rather than limiting its identity to retail media network, pursuing offsite expansion including Social Plus product with Meta and Instagram that leverages first-party data.

“We don’t want to just be in retail media,” Jensen said. “We want to be a media company. We’re a retailer and a media company. We want to continue to find ways like with what we’re doing with CTV to leverage our first party data to get to that place where you can have this full funnel solution.”

Looking at Best Buy’s 2026 roadmap, Jensen said to expect new tools enabling advertisers to understand campaign performance, advancing measurement toward incrementality analysis and multi-touch attribution that answers persistent advertiser questions.

“If you are a consumer electronics advertiser, you want to come to Best Buy because of the data we have, the products and solutions that we offer,” Jensen said.",https://www.beet.tv/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/100063-thumbnail-2-1024x576.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 16:58:23.532587

The move highlights the extent to which issues around safety and risk management are beginning to be baked into the development of frontier AI, as opposed to a bolt‑on function. CEO Sam Altman has described the role as high‑level and difficult, which suggests that the hire will face complex, high‑stakes work starting on day one.

What the Head of Preparedness Role Covers at OpenAI

Preparedness at a frontier laboratory typically involves three layers: model evaluation, product safety, and organizational response. Expect tasks to range from red‑teaming for biosecurity and cyber misuse; stress‑testing models to predict social harms such as radicalization or self‑harm enablement; and building metrics that signal when a system’s contours have breached risk thresholds.

On the product side, this typically includes crisis interventions that foster safe‑completion behavior, increased identity and use controls for sensitive domains, and provenance tools that curtail AI‑generated misinformation.

At the organizational level, Preparedness drives tabletop exercises, incident response drills, third‑party audits, and cross‑company escalation protocols in line with models such as NIST’s AI Risk Management Framework.

Why the Timing of OpenAI’s Preparedness Hire Matters

OpenAI has gone without an individual lead for the better part of a year, after previous leadership reshuffles split the role among multiple executives, industry reporting shows. Re‑centralizing accountability is a sign of efforts to fortify security operations as models scale and new capabilities emerge at an increasing pace.

Altman has called the role both “critical” and, given its world‑saving stakes, “stressful” — a task that, much like a preparedness team, must predict low‑probability, high‑impact events while shipping useful protections that work for millions of users. That tension — between abstract risk and the actual behavior of products in the field — is now becoming the gravity well for AI policymaking.

Recent lawsuits raise the stakes for AI safety at OpenAI

Recent wrongful death lawsuits have claimed that ChatGPT helped pave the way for tragedies by encouraging delusional beliefs or not adequately deterring requests about self‑harm. Though the facts will be debated in court, the cases illustrate a difficult problem: generative models can create persuasive counterfeits in high‑stakes areas where even a tiny number of failures is unacceptable.

Mature preparedness involves combining technical interventions — for example, refusal policies, retrieval‑augmented safety responses, and specialized crisis prompts — with monitoring that helps identify unsafe conversations and route them into safer flows. It also requires post‑incident analysis, much as aviation now looks into near misses. That feedback loop is critical: when things break, the repair must measurably make it stronger overall.

The broader safety and policy landscape around OpenAI

The position will also interface with a rapidly developing policy landscape. The UK’s AI Safety Institute is releasing standardized capability and risk assessments for sophisticated models. In the United States, federal agencies are working to operationalize the White House’s AI executive actions, and NIST’s guidance is rapidly becoming a de facto baseline for risk in enterprise AI. The AI Act, meanwhile, will impose new obligations on high‑risk and general‑purpose models.

OpenAI also contributes to multi‑stakeholder initiatives like the Frontier Model Forum, which has focused on red‑team sharing and incident reporting. A competent Head of Preparedness is also likely to strengthen relationships with external labs, academia, and civil society for vetting evals, comparing benchmarks, and coordinating on responsible release practices.

Compensation and expectations for the OpenAI role

The job is based in San Francisco and pays a listed salary of $555,000 with equity.

The role also telegraphs a combination of experience and urgency: The hire will have to marry a security discipline with product pragmatism, leading cross‑functional efforts and communicating risk to the company’s executives and regulators alike.

Practicality rules over abstract principles. Candidates with experience running security operations centers, leading incident response for cloud platforms, overseeing medical or aviation safety programs, or shipping safety‑critical ML systems will have a significant leg up. Look for more mandate around scaling evals, beyond security controls or auditing functions, to address safety failures, and “ship gates” based on the success of a red‑team.

What success looks like for OpenAI’s preparedness lead

Success will manifest in fewer and less severe incidents, better refusal accuracy for dangerous situations, transparent post‑mortems, and evaluations published that can stand up under independent laboratory testing. It also requires clear thresholds for when to throttle, fine‑tune, or restrict features as capabilities mature.

OpenAI’s call for a Head of Preparedness recognizes the obvious: as models grow more capable, the cost of doing safety wrong rises. The right leader won’t just predict the edge cases — they’ll establish systems, culture, and accountability to catch them before they can harm users.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/featured_edited_1766941698.png,N,,2025-12-28 17:13:23.931142

The company is rolling out a new prompt-based video editor inside Adobe Firefly, along with additional third-party image and video models, including Black Forest Labs’ FLUX.2 and Topaz Labs’ Astra.

Until now, Firefly’s video tools were largely generation-only. If one part of a clip didn’t work, you had to regenerate the entire video from scratch. The new editor changes that.

You can now make precise, text-based edits to existing video clips, using prompts to tweak specific elements like colors, lighting, subjects, and even camera movement. Think instructions such as “Change the sky to overcast,” or “Zoom in slightly on the main subject,” applied directly to the clip instead of starting over.

Firefly also gets a timeline-based editing view, making it easier to adjust frames, audio, and other details in a way that feels closer to traditional video editors.

Under the hood, Adobe is expanding Firefly’s model lineup. Through Runway’s Aleph model, users can issue targeted visual instructions, while Adobe’s own Firefly Video Model now lets you upload a reference frame or a sample camera movement and ask Firefly to recreate that motion in your video.

On the quality side, Topaz Astra is being added for AI upscaling, allowing creators to enhance videos up to 1080p or 4K. And on the image side, FLUX.2 is coming to Firefly across platforms immediately, with availability for Adobe Express users starting in January.

Adobe is also introducing collaborative boards, hinting at a more team-oriented future for Firefly as it competes with fast-moving AI image and video platforms.

To drive adoption, Adobe is offering a temporary perk: subscribers to Firefly Pro, Firefly Premium, and the 7,000- and 50,000-credit plans will get unlimited generations from all image models and the Adobe Firefly Video Model inside Firefly until January 15.

This update caps off a busy year for Adobe’s AI push. In 2025 alone, Firefly expanded from standalone image generation into a full cross-platform app with mobile support, subscriptions, and a growing ecosystem of third-party models.

And, with over 4,000 stores nationwide having some kind of grocery department, it's a common choice for grocery shopping on a budget. Although Walmart's reputation for affordability is well-earned, there's another grocery chain that tends to be even cheaper.

With around 2,600 American locations, Aldi doesn't have quite as many stores as Walmart, but shoppers with access to both have generally noticed that Aldi has lower prices, especially if you rely on its high-quality store brands. For instance, a 13-ounce package of Aldi's knockoff Chips Ahoy cookies currently costs $2.75. Walmart's corresponding cookie product? $3.00.

When it comes to variety of inventory and keeping products in stock, Walmart wins the day. It's a much larger company with significantly bigger stores, meaning more money to buy inventory and more space to keep things stocked. And some products are cheaper at Walmart. But saving the most money possible will mean some trips to Aldi as well.

Basic groceries tend to be more affordable at Aldi

When we put Aldi vs. Walmart in a grocery shopping comparison, we appreciated that Aldi had a good selection of fresh produce and individually-wrapped steaks. A three-pack of romaine lettuce hearts will currently run you $3.29 at Aldi, compared to $3.86 at Walmart. And for a seasonal comparison, butternut squash is $1.54/pound at Walmart, which sounds reasonable until you see that Aldi has the same for 89 cents per pound.

Beef is an essential grocery item for many American households, and Aldi has historically had cheaper beef than Walmart. The trend seems to endure as well: grass-fed New York Strip is currently $13.99/pound at Aldi (and the only kind it carries) compared to Walmart's $20.94/pound for the same.

But just because Aldi tends to be cheaper for groceries than Walmart doesn't mean that's always the case. Eggs tend to be more affordable at Walmart than Aldi, which can be critical for big families. A dozen cage-free white eggs at Walmart cost $1.97, compared to $3.55 at Aldi. And Great Value Italian Bread is less than half the price of its Aldi equivalent. It's another reminder to shop around for the absolute best prices possible, even if one store tends to have the less expensive prices.

The chaos started during the Christmas weekend, and its impact is still being felt, as thousands of flights were disrupted by a powerful winter storm. The storm, which caused widespread cancellations and delays, has forced these airlines to ground planes and scramble to rebook stranded passengers.

Delta, along with its counterparts like JetBlue and United, was hit hard, with hundreds of flights canceled and thousands of travellers left in limbo at airports across the country. This Christmas nightmare has led to a travel hell for many, making it one of the most challenging holiday seasons for both passengers and airlines.

As we move into Sunday, the new update shows that the situation remains critical, with little relief in sight. If you’re flying in the coming days, be prepared for more disruptions. Travel And Tour World urges readers to keep reading to understand the full impact of this travel nightmare and how these airlines are responding to the ongoing crisis.

The US is reeling from the impact of Storm Devin, a catastrophic winter weather event that has crippled airports and disrupted air travel during the peak holiday season. This storm has caused chaos across the country, with JetBlue, Delta, American Airlines, and United Airlines among the hardest-hit carriers. More than 1,800 flights have been cancelled, and 22,000 flights delayed, creating a nightmare for holiday travelers. From New York to California, the storm has affected flights nationwide, leaving passengers stranded in airports for hours. As severe weather continues to wreak havoc, these airlines are scrambling to rebook passengers, but the disruptions aren’t expected to end anytime soon. This article takes a deep dive into the airline cancellations and delays, shedding light on how this unprecedented winter storm is reshaping holiday travel in the United States.

JetBlue Hit Hard by Winter Chaos: Over 350 Flights Canceled

The winter storm Devin has wreaked havoc on JetBlue Airways, which has been one of the most affected carriers during this brutal storm. Over 350 JetBlue flights have been cancelled due to the extreme weather conditions sweeping through the Northeast US. Major hubs like JFK, Boston Logan, and Newark Liberty were particularly impacted, with hundreds of passengers stranded in terminals. According to Reuters, JetBlue quickly waived change fees for affected travellers, providing rebooking options to help them get home during the busy holiday season. Despite these efforts, delays and cancellations continue to mount. With snowstorms and freezing rain battering the Northeast, it’s clear that the airline is facing one of its toughest holiday seasons yet.

The storm didn’t just affect JetBlue’s operations but also brought travel chaos to major East Coast airports. JFK Airport, known for its high traffic during the holidays, had significant delays as JetBlue scrambled to accommodate rebooked passengers. As the storm raged on, passengers were left frustrated by long queues, limited services, and heightened tension. The situation remains challenging, with more cancellations expected as the storm continues.

Delta Airlines Struggles to Keep Up: Over 200 Flights Canceled

Next up, Delta Air Lines has been hit hard by the storm, with over 200 flights cancelled during the peak of the winter chaos. Like JetBlue, Delta also has a heavy presence in New York, Atlanta, and Detroit, which all saw widespread disruptions. Passengers reported significant delays and confusion at terminals as Delta tried to manage the high volume of affected travellers. In the wake of this disruption, Delta activated its flexible travel policies, allowing passengers to change their flights without incurring additional fees. However, with over 22,000 flights delayed nationwide, the airline’s efforts to rebook passengers have been limited by the sheer scale of the storm’s impact.

The cancellations and delays have been particularly concentrated at major Delta hubs such as Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson, Minneapolis-Saint Paul (MSP), and LaGuardia Airport. Passengers were advised to check with the airline for real-time updates on their flights and expected wait times. Delta’s quick response to waive change fees is a crucial step to helping ease the burden on travellers, but the delays continue to affect their operations well into the holiday period.

American Airlines Faces Mass Disruptions

American Airlines was not immune to the storm’s wrath, with over 140 flights cancelled due to hazardous weather conditions. With severe snowstorms gripping the Northeast and the Midwest, American Airlines struggled to maintain operations during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year. Major airports like Philadelphia International Airport (PHL) and Chicago O’Hare saw high numbers of cancellations and delays, with many passengers left stranded.

American Airlines was quick to respond with flexible rebooking options, offering customers the chance to change their flight schedules without penalties. However, given the large number of affected travellers, passengers were still facing long waits, extended processing times, and overcrowded terminals. The holiday travel surge was already a challenging prospect, but the storm made it much worse. For those lucky enough to rebook, many faced connections that were severely delayed, further disrupting their holiday plans.

United Airlines and the Storm’s Lingering Effects: 97 Flights Grounded

While United Airlines wasn’t as severely affected as some other major carriers, it still faced 97 cancellations as a result of the storm. As one of the top airlines in the Midwest, United Airlines operates many flights through airports like Chicago O’Hare, which experienced significant disruptions. The airline was also impacted by snowstorms and icy conditions in other parts of the country, particularly affecting flights to and from airports like Denver International and San Francisco International.

United Airlines took swift action to help passengers, waiving rebooking fees and offering flexible travel options to assist those who were unable to make their originally scheduled flights. While the storm’s impact on United was less intense compared to other airlines, it still created a ripple effect across the network, with thousands of passengers facing delays as they waited to board their rescheduled flights.

Storm Devin: A Travel Nightmare for Thousands of Passengers

Storm Devin has proven to be one of the most severe winter storms in recent memory. According to reports, the storm caused widespread disruptions across the Northeast, causing over 1,800 flight cancellations and leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded in airports. This storm doesn’t just affect the airlines; it also has a knock-on effect on the American economy, with travel spending declining as people delay or cancel their holiday plans.

In the wake of this storm, many airports, including JFK, Boston Logan, and Philadelphia International, experienced significant delays and cancellations. With limited staffing due to the holidays, managing this influx of affected passengers has been a monumental challenge. Passengers are advised to stay updated with their airlines and consider alternate routes if possible. The extent of the storm’s impact has left many questioning how the airline industry will cope with future weather-related disruptions.

The Holiday Travel Surge: A Look at the Bigger Picture

While Storm Devin may have caused major disruptions, it highlights a bigger issue facing the airline industry: the increasing strain on airports and air traffic during peak seasons. The holiday period is always a busy time, but the recent surge in flight cancellations and delays due to severe weather demonstrates how vulnerable the system is to such events. As the US continues to face unpredictable weather patterns, airlines must invest in more robust systems to handle such crises efficiently.

Airlines like JetBlue, Delta, American, and United are doing their best to mitigate these issues, but as the storm continues to wreak havoc, many flights are still up in the air — quite literally. The recovery process will take days, if not weeks, with some passengers still stranded or rebooking their flights at the last minute. This article serves as a reminder of the unpredictability of holiday travel and the importance of preparing for unexpected disruptions.

In den USA erhielten die Dänen eine Zulassung für eine oral zu verabreichende Variante des Abnehmmittels Wegovy. Es ist das erste Medikamente dieser Art, welches bereits im Januar seinen Marktstart feiern soll.

Damit ist Novo Nordisk der Konkurrenz einen Schritt voraus, was zu Wochenbeginn noch mit Kursgewinnen von mehr als sieben Prozent bedacht wurde. Am Freitag ließt die Stimmung an der Walltstreet aber wieder etwas nach. Der höhere Kurs konnte sich konsolidieren. Für weitere Kursgewinne reichte es indes nicht.

Immer schön vorsichtig

Eine Rolle dürfte dabei eine Einschätzung von BMO Capital gespielt haben. Dort blickt man eher nüchtern auf die jüngsten Neuigkeiten und warnt davor, dass der zeitliche Vorsprung vor der Konkurrenz nur von kurzer Dauer sein dürfte. Tatsächlich plant Eli Lilly derzeit damit, im Frühjahr einen Zulassungsantrag für eine Abnehmpille in die Wege zu leiten.

Sollten Anleger sofort verkaufen? Oder lohnt sich doch der Einstieg bei Novo Nordisk?

Novo Nordisk Aktie Chart

Die Analysten bleiben letztlich bei einet neutralen Einschätzung und das Kursziel von 46 US-Dollar sieht nun sogar eine spürbare Korrektur vor. In Panik gerieten die Aktionäre deshalb zwar noch nicht. Doch am Freitag ging es um 0,3 Prozent bis auf 52,40 Dollar abwärts.

Novo Nordisk unter Beobachtung

Ankommen wird es nun darauf, dass Novo Nordisk seine Zulassung auch zu neuen Umsätzen und Gewinnen nutzen kann. Dabei bleibt manche Frage offen. Etwa, wie viele neue Kunden sich für das frische Medikament finden lassen und wie viele schlicht von Abnehmspritzen wechseln. Grenzenlose Euphorie kommt offenbar noch nicht auf und trotz der Erholung vor den Feiertagen bleibt der Chart ein eher trauriger Anblick.

MOYNIHAN: Well, so I think the way that the consumer would feel AI at Bank of America is Erica.
And- and the administration knows that, Secretary Bessent knows it that guarantee helps keep that mortgage rate down, but also provides a 30 year mortgage.

Editor's note: This interview was filmed on Dec. 17, 2025.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, thank you for making time.

BANK OF AMERICA CEO BRIAN MOYNIHAN: It's great to be here. Good to see you again.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about the state of the economy, because our CBS polling is showing that the most Americans asked this question say their holiday items are hard to afford.

MOYNIHAN: Yeah.

BRENNAN: They're pulling back because incomes are not keeping up with inflation. But it's a very different story. When you look at the upper income brackets, I know you see data of actual transactions. Are people doing what they tell us they're doing?

MOYNIHAN: So- so we not only see it in the aggregate, we also see it in pieces. And so if you look in the aggregate, the amount spent through the Thanksgiving weekend, on you know, Black Friday and Cyber Monday through all the month of November and the first part of December, it's- it's up four- four and a quarter, four and a half percent versus last year's November. And so it's growing. And then if you look by terciles, three buckets of income levels, it's clear the people in the bottom income level, at lower income levels are spending a little faster growth rate, but still growing and in the middle and upper faster. So, you know, what they're telling you is, what they feel, what they're actually seeing, is spending is really solid, reasonably solid heading into the end of the year, and it's been kind of going along like that all of December. Now, wages have grown, but inflation bothers people. Jobs are you know, the unemployment rate's very low, but it's been rising. So there's a lot of discussion in there. At the end of day, people are spending they have good credit quality. They are employed, and wait- we can see wages growing in as people's paychecks come in at a 3% clip. So it's a- it's pretty solid right now.

BRENNAN: Is that still, though stilted towards the upper income brackets? Is it that K shaped economy some people talk about--

MOYNIHAN Our team puts the- looks at this. Yes, it the growth rate difference is higher, but all of- all the third, a third, a third, all three thirds are growing.

BRENNAN: And you think that will continue?

MOYNIHAN: That's been continuous. And so that's the question. They grow at different rates, but they're all growing, which all means they're putting more money in the economy than they did this time last year.

BRENNAN: Why do you think people have sentiment that's low but spending that's higher?

MOYNIHAN: It's- you hear about it, you've talked about it. It's this question of affordability and prices and trying to figure out how that- because we had a very, a very strange process from 20 through now, we had COVID lockdown, then we had all the stimulus, and we had high inflation, and then we had wages caught up to it. And if you draw a line and say, Here's wages and here's spending and here's price growth, it's- they stay in sync across a long period of time, but they went at different times, and so they saw the inflation and 20 and 23 and 24 that that was on their minds, and they want to see it subsist, and it'll take a little while to subsist. But as you go into 26 having come through 25 the incremental hit of that would be lower. And even when the Fed looks at they think inflation keeps working its way down. But it's- it's what people feel, and you can't discount that. And it's also at certain job categories and stuff, there's been more dislocation, and that's due to some of the government downsizing and some of the other things going on. But, but it's, it's not widespread at four, you know, 4.6% unemployment in the last number they publish, that's still in the- in our business careers, is actually a very low unemployment rate, frankly,

BRENNAN: And what do you see then as the biggest risk to the economy?

MOYNIHAN Well, when you look out ahead, it's, it's it's the question wars is another thing that could really shake up the markets. But the real question is- is- will the consumer keep spending in the US? We have the US economy growing about 2.4% next year. We have in- but that's dependent upon a consumer that stays engaged. If the consumer becomes less engaged as we move into 20- from 25 into 26 and slows down their spending. That's going to slow down the economy. So that's a risk. You just don't see it anywhere now. The second risk is wars and other things that could go on that could create shocks to the market. And you know, then there's the usual things, cyber events and things like that. But the real risk is, will the Americans, if the companies of America employ people and pay them a little bit more, they will spend an economy in the US will be fine, and then you have these investments in the stimulus from the uh, the tax act, you have the stimulus from some of the investments coming in that are keep kicking in. And that's why our team went from one and a half percent, probably four months ago, to two and a half percent, 2.4% for 26 now, yeah.

BRENNAN: Okay, so in the past year, trade and tariffs, there were a lot of shocks to the system. It was a big concern, but Bank of America now projects President Trump's strategy is one of de escalation, not escalation. Does that mean you see this trade war with China cooling off?

MOYNIHAN: Well, I think- if you go back to where we were in April, there was a lot of lack of understanding about where this would end up, and that affected small businesses--

BRENNAN: There was shock--

MOYNIHAN: --and medium size businesses--

BRENNAN: There was shock.

MOYNIHAN: They were shocked.

BRENNAN: There was shock on liberation day.

MOYNIHAN: The sheer size, the volume, the dollars, across the board, et cetera. What you say now, as times moved on, it's sort of a 15% on one side, and then a higher number based on people who won't commit to purchase from the US, or won't commit to lowering their non tariff barriers and things like that. And so the question, when I talk to foreign governments and they ask you the question about what's this all mean--or foreign CEOs--you say, look, you got a choice. You can be here or be here. You just have to make the choice. You're going to be- drive more towards America, and you will come down to 15% to go from a 10% across the board, to 15% for the broad base of countries, not a huge impact. And that's where our team says it's starting to- it's starting to de escalate, and that you're starting to see the resolution of the discussions into 15% here 17 different numbers. When you put China, China's a different question, because the national security interests, the rare earth minerals, the magnets, batteries, just AI, all that stuff. It's a very different case. And I think also between Mexico and China, the USMCA, which has to be redone, is also a different case. But broadly in the world, you can see sort of the end point here and now they've just got to (INAUDIBLE)- it's got to work through the system.

BRENNAN: How much of a toll has that taken on small businesses? I understand B of A is the largest small business lender.

MOYNIHAN: So we're the largest small business lender. If we were sitting here in the second quarter of this year, it was a big toll. They were very- because rates have gone up, and that costs them more money because they borrow on revolving lines of credit. In other words, they borrow a floating rate, and then the tariffs came in and caused them I'm not sure I can get the goods at what price and how can I commit? But as you went through the year, rates came down a little bit, so they're more their issue right now is, can I get the labor I need to do, to bid the contracts, to do the work I'm doing? Because the immigration policies haven't settled in yet, and that's causing people concern. It's not that they agree with them or are disagreeing. They just need to have the answer, and that's what they're looking for. So if you think across four policy regimes, tax-trade-tariff, immigration, and then ultimately, deregulation. You've seen a resolution of a lot of them, but I think the next one for small business, what they tell us is labor availability. How they get there is, I need people to do this work, and I need to be dependable. They're here. So give me a set of rules and I'll go play with them. But I need to be clarified what the rules are.

BRENNAN: The labor scarcity issue, people just can't find folks--

MOYNIHAN: The- dependability and people who are probably not anything to do with what the policies are about feel- feel differently, and that's if they don't feel they can go to work, if they don't feel they can do things that that just has to resolve. And small businesses are generally most impacted because they don't have our wonderful research team to figure it all out and talk and talk to the big clients who have other teams to do it, and that's trickier. So I think, and by the way, the administration understands that they're working on it, they're trying to figure out how to get that part put together so it's clear what the policies will be and won't be, so that, or aren't, or, more importantly, aren't, really what the people that the ill settled down, but that that issue of labor was a 23 issue after the great resignation disappeared from small, medium sized businesses came back in literally because of where, where we are from this summer on.

BRENNAN: One of the other big factors, it seems in the jobs market, is this question of artificial intelligence. How much is B of A relying on AI to do things like predict loan defaults or identify risks?

MOYNIHAN: Well, so I think the way that the consumer would feel AI at Bank of America is Erica. So if you go on our mobile app- you there's a bot there. It's an agent. It's been there for many years. It does 2 million customer interfaces a day. So it's not small. 20 million customers actively use it. It can answer 700 questions. So that's real and been going on. And so that's the way a customer would feel it. If you're a corporate customer, you'd feel with Erica's embed in our cash pro- so your portal you go to as a company to make payments or FX transactions, and you want to ask questions, Erica is there. So that's- that you're asking about something different. We have used models for years about predicting defaults. So we do stress testing. Those are all models to predict the outcome. We have loss given defaults, default predictions. That's all there. Can these help us make us more informed? Yes, can they help different types of employees operate faster? Absolutely. So we're deploying across all our teammates AI, have access to AI tools. The- there are specialized AI tools in certain areas, but we think the highest best use near term is either discrete process application or in helping us build intelligent to high levels. But to interface to a customer, you have to have your data right. You have to have the controls right, because you can't give the customer the wrong answer, whether it's, I'm going to approve your loan or not, and that's why this will be a little- take a little more care to implement in customer facing business with trust, which is what financial services is.

BRENNAN: Well, I ask it because there's that question of how many human jobs get replaced, right? And when you look at that recent Business Roundtable Survey of CEOs, they predict that while there is spending on technology and AI, they're not looking at hiring going up. They see it actually reducing.

MOYNIHAN: So, so there's a couple things that is what's on people's minds, and that's when we talk to our teammates. We're saying, Hey, we're going to bring AI and make it more efficient, and then we got to produce more activity. And you don't have to worry. If you capture AI and use it in your day to day work, that's a great thing. And so it's not a threat to their jobs. But on the other hand, I think people are now assuming they're going to get benefits, and we'll see if they get those benefits. But you know, if you think from 1969 to 2019, it was 50 years, a lot of technology came in America employs twice as many people in 2019 as we did in 1969. So will this wind up? I don't know, and nobody really knows for sure, because we haven't ever had it. But on the other hand, there's a capability in our company. The commercial bankers are calling on commercial customers. If they get 10% more efficient, we may not add a lot to grow, but doesn't mean we're gonna take away and get the efficiency- we want to grow. We want to drive more growth. So the AI will be spent- the efficiencies from AI will be spent to keep growing the company, I think.

BRENNAN: So, it's a problem for the new college grad, but it's not necessarily a layoff that you're making, essentially.

MOYNIHAN: Yeah, well, we just hired 2000 plus new college grads in July, so it's- we didn't change the size of class- my advice to those kids, if you ask them if they're worried about, they say they're worried about- these are kids that we hire, 200,000 applications, we hire 2000 people. They came into our company. If you ask them, if they're scared, they say they are. And I understand that. But I- says, harness it, and you shouldn't. It'll be your world ahead of you.

BRENNAN: Let me ask you about the mortgage business. You've got a big one. The Fed says activity in the housing sector is weak. What do you see is behind that hesitation?

MOYNIHAN: There are two parts to it. One is the rate structure is higher, so it's just slowed down the activity. So if people are going to sell a house to move up to a bigger house or something, the cost of debt is going to go up. So that's slowing down that activity. The second is building. And there's housing volume shortages all over the country. Some single- you could have single family, multi small multi floor units, things like that. Or even more, bigger multi family, major cities, but there's a universal housing shortage, because for so many years it's been hard to get housing permitted, and so the advice I give to anybody is you're probably not going to see the 10 year rates go down. Our teammates think the Fed funds rate gets the low of three and but the tenure rate stays between four and four and a half, which means the mortgage rate won't be a lot different than this today, but if you increase supply, you'll keep prices flat, and wages will grow through it. And you're starting to see prices have flattened out in many places. So you got to build supply, and you got to get permitting done, and you got to do that is probably the solution. Moving mortgage rates 50 basis points will not be a huge change. When you have a bunch of people 3% mortgage rates, that's not going to be changed. And by the way, for the American economy, we do not want to have an economy that has to have that low rate structure again, because that means we're not growing, we're not successful, and we're probably offsetting a recession. So we shouldn't be cheering for 3% mortgage rates. It was an anomaly that happened, and now we got to get back to normal.

BRENNAN: Well, you do hear the administration talk about rates coming down is a good thing? You're just saying it's not a simple, quick fix.

MOYNIHAN: Well, for the housing market, because there's 60 million- there's 130 odd million households in America, half of them don't have a mortgage. This is this whole lock in question is not even a relevant question. They rent, and so you got to bring- rental affordability is a question. Or they own outright, and that's a different question. They inherit a house, you know, third generation, or something like that. So it's a very complex thing, but simplistic- simplistically, if mortgage rates come down, people can pay more. The reality is, if prices come down, people have more affordability on that side. So I think it works itself through. But we had a very different rate environment for a lot of years, and that's- that's hard for people to think about, because people under the age of 40, 2,3, 4, no, were not out working in an environment where we had a 3% Fed funds rate, which is more the norm than not.

BRENNAN: So let me ask you about Fannie and Freddie. Taxpayers took a stake during the financial crisis in these mortgage lenders. The Treasury Secretary said that they are expected to return to the public market in the next year, with the government selling a portion of that stake. Does Bank of America have a role in that transaction? But- but for consumers, is that actually going to push up the cost of owning a home?

MOYNIHAN: I don't talk about client relationships, but look, it won't if they keep the guarantee. And- and the administration knows that, Secretary Bessent knows it that guarantee helps keep that mortgage rate down, but also provides a 30 year mortgage. Because now, when you make a mortgage loan without a government guarantee for a borrower who may be on the qualification levels, there are more advantageous to borrow. You're making a decision for the next 30 years that the borrower is going to be okay, or a lot of years. So that guarantee is critical to U.S. getting fixed rate mortgages and having a lot of mortgage availability, and then they've run the things pretty responsible since financial crisis. Down payments have stayed substantial. So the credit quality of current portfolios is pretty good. And they can't lose that, because that was the reason. One of the reasons why we had the financial crisis was the low down payments and lots of mortgage loans with zero equity in them. And as soon as prices on houses came down, the whole thing exploded, and all America was affected. So I think they're very mindful all that, and I think- but they're critical of the U.S. housing system. They always have been. They're a great company. They're a iconic company for the U.S., frankly, now to put them together and are running well.

BRENNAN: So the president has announced that he wants all these sweeping changes to the Federal Reserve. Chair Powell is set to retire from the job in May. For someone at home, how much does that job matter to the consumer. How do you explain that?

MOYNIHAN: Well, it's one of the interesting things. So the President's going to appoint a new chair of the Federal Reserve. Presidents throughout- since the Federal Reserve, 100 plus years ago, was founded, have done that, it's not new. He's got great candidates. He'll appoint somebody, and we'll help that candidate get the information to be successful, and so we'll see what he does. But that's his prerogative. You know, that's he should do it. There's- my mind, there's too much fascination with the Fed. We're not- we're a country- we're a country that's driven by the private sector, by what people do, and in the businesses and the companies, small companies and large companies, medium sized companies, and entrepreneurs and doctors and lawyer- all these people drive our economy. The idea that we are like hanging on the thread by the Fed moving rates 25 basis points, it seems to me we've gotten out of whack. And so we got to get- since the financial crisis, the Fed had a big role in stabilizing the economy. That's what they're supposed to do. That went away number of years ago. It came back a little bit in COVID. They're a lender of last resort. They're there to stabilize markets and price- but other net you shouldn't know they exist quite frankly--

BRENNAN: --So you don't worry about all this, you know, handwringing of political interference with the Fed, once that new position is--

MOYNIHAN: --The market is a- will punish people if we don't have an independent Fed. And everybody knows that.

BRENNAN: Let me ask you about Trump accounts. They're trying to build generational wealth. The administration says by having these wealthy donors, state governments, employers put money in these tax advantage accounts for kids as an addition to the federal government putting some money into some of them, are you going to have a role in that program? And what do you think more broadly about expanding the number of people putting money in the stock market, in these index funds.

MOYNIHAN: So I think number one, if- at our company starting 2017 we- after the tax act from that year, a lot of companies gave their employees $1,000 bonus. We started doing something else the next year, which we kept going and I've gone since. So our 200,000 plus employees every year get an award of stock across the whole board, and that's built up to be s--

BRENNAN: --Many corporations do that, restricted stock.

MOYNIHAN: Yeah, but it's gone on for now. A lot of them did it once, didn't do it, but very few have done it that much. And that's like $6 billion of stock have gone into those employees. And so I believe in stock ownership by everybody. I believe in holding that stock and appreciating. And so we believe in that, we have a 401k, that people can invest, we have 7% match and all that stuff. These accounts, I think, are also good. The question is, you know, the parents have to make the contributions, and the government will put some money in, but the broader products available for parents, it'll be good to save. But I think we shouldn't- we should do this, but we also have to remember financial education. Because if you can get an education generally, in skills training, because if somebody could earn $10,000 more a year than they'd otherwise earn, or they can balance their budget and be cash flow positive to $10,000. That goes on for their, you know, from their first job, 21,18, all the way through 65 that is a lot of money. Where this for 18 years, will be a lot of money, but it'll be- it'll stop where that will go on forever. So we need this type of work. And I expose the equity markets underinvesting in America and all those things, very low cost where the index funds doesn- it had basis points where they were saying that's all the right way to do it. By the way, it was back to privatization, Social Security in those days and that stuff.

BRENNAN: Is this basically a way to do that? I mean, every baby suddenly has a stock market investment.

MOYNIHAN: It'll- I mean, we'll have to see. You and I won't be around 50 years, 60 years from now, maybe you will be, I won't be around 60 years from now to think about it. But it- you know- it'll, it'll do that. But equity investment by people holding that and having have to hold it so they can't churn it and sell it. And that's, that's a good thing. So I think it's a great product. I think it's wonderful that people are stepping up and contributing to it. We all have to think about an employer, because we have that stock program, which is several thousand dollars to employees. And, you know, we have our 401k match. And if we do this, how does that work? And stuff like that. But- and if you do it for kids, what do you do for the rest of people? You have this question that not everybody in our company has kids. And so if I put the match in for- if I put the money for people with kids, what I do with people without kids? So there's a little more complex, but it's a good thing, and I think we'll figure out how to participate and make it happen.

BRENNAN: So back in August, when we spoke, you talked about these allegations of banks playing politics and discriminating against conservatives. You pushed back pretty hard in that moment. But earlier this month, the Trump administration released preliminary findings about banks, including Bank of America. It's a six page report. There's reference to your environmental and sustainability-related decisions that were made during the Biden administration. Do you feel you have to undo these? Have you undone them?

MOYNIHAN: A lot of them have been- have been undone or made more precise because the interpretation wasn't actually what went on. So if you read the website, you could say, oh, they're doing this. And the reality was that's not what was going- never was intended. And so we don't debank anybody for religious or political reasons. We made the policies clear so people could see it. We welcome all the input from the banking regulators and others. And we'll, we'll look at anybody who, who feels we- believe me, they- people have thought they were closed for reasons that they couldn't understand. We've looked at that probably, you know, because customers can come to our company and say, 'you've closed my account, why?' And we can tell them. But I think people are forgetting the reason why a lot of this went on was reputational risk was an assessment process that went on, and it was real. And, and believe me, you know, people would read the paper and said, you know, Jane Smith, John Smith, you're doing business with them. They did something wrong. You must be a fail as a company, and therefore we're going to write you up.

BRENNAN: That was during the Biden administration that kind of--

MOYNIHAN: --even–

BRENNAN: --social pressure you're saying--

MOYNIHAN: --20 years ago--

BRENNAN: 20 years ago, okay--

MOYNIHAN: It's been going on for a long time. It just kept building up, and then it's and then the second thing is that, that for AML and KYC issues, we had to close accounts. And so the level of a transaction was set in 1972 at 10,000 and you have two things, if it goes above that, you have to pour it down, if it goes multiple ones close to that. That hasn't been changed since 1972. That number would be 80,000 today, so what we thought was material then--

BRENNAN: --in terms of, like, suspicious transactions.

MOYNIHAN: Yeah, and so and so. There's a lot of overwork here that we're trying to- if they get those regulations right, that will be very helpful. So there's sort of the ESG side of it, those things I think a lot of us fixed to make sure they're based on risk and real facts and stuff. Because this was going on far before the new administration came in, frankly, in states and other places. There is the question of getting the AML, KYC letter and then the reputation risk, which to the credit of the current federal bankers, they've taken that off the table.

BRENNAN: because there really aren't that many points of agreement these days between Wall Street and the White House. But this issue the president himself really dug into and he said that Bank of America declined to open new accounts for him and his family after his first term in office. Do you think you've patched things up? I mean, it's- do you know what he's talking about?

MOYNIHAN: We- I wouldn't talk about client relationships with anybody, but we--

BRENNAN: He said it on television, about you.

MOYNIHAN: I know that. People- if I had a nickel for everything everybody said about me on television it- you know, I'd be rich. So at the end of day, we bank everybody. We have 125,000 religious organizations. We have 70 million consumers. We have tens of thou- we have the biggest small business lender in the country period and stop. You know? And so, you know, the idea that we toss people out, it's, it's just not true. So I won't get into an individual customer and their, and their points of view. But look, some of these policies, we were pushed to places that we've been able to bring back to the center and America ought to feel good about that.

BRENNAN: And you think the things are copacetic now. You put this behind you with the White House?

MOYNIHAN: Yes.

BRENNAN: Okay, I'm getting a wrap over here on time. So thank you for making time for us.

MOYNIHAN: Happy Holidays, thank you.

Swedish cheap'n'chic fashion giant H&M announced on Tuesday that Italian fashion house Versace would be its next guest designer.

""H&M is proud to announce that its autumn 2011 designer collaboration will be with one of the world's most legendary fashion brands, Versace,"" the Swedish company said in a statement.

The Versace line will hit some 300 H&M stores worldwide on November 2011 and ""will look back on the heritage of the brand, full of leather, print, color and exuberance in exclusive materials,"" H&M said.

The collection will include both women's and men's clothing as well as some home accessories such as a bedspread and cushions.

A pre-spring collection, also designed by Donatella Versace, will be available exclusively online from January 19, 2012.

""I am thrilled to be collaborating with H&M and to have the opportunity of reaching their wide audience. The collection will be quintessential Versace, perfect for H&M and Versace fans everywhere,"" the Italian designer said.

Known for its trendy yet affordable fashions, H&M is the world's third largest clothing group behind Spain's Inditex, which owns Zara, and Gap of the United States.

It first teamed up with a top fashion designer in 2004, in a tie-up with Karl Lagerfeld and sent its monthly sales soaring.

Since then it has hooked up with the likes of Stella McCartney, Viktor and Rolf, Comme des Garcons, Jimmy Choo and Sonia Rykiel -- as well as one-off lines with style icons Kylie Minogue or Madonna.

H&M was founded in Vaesteraas in central Sweden in 1947. The cheap-and-chic fashion company had 2,206 stores and 59,440 employees worldwide at the end of 2010.

Italian luxury fashion house Versace was founded in 1978 by Gianni Versace. His sister Donatella took over as head of design in 1997.",,N,,2025-12-28 17:59:39.707207

The company will test its mapless, AI-driven technology with the launch.

That said, on December 18, Nikhil Devnani from Bernstein reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and raised the price target from $110 to $115. The analyst noted that they remain optimistic on the stock despite the pressure from the emerging AV industry, driven by increased competition from players like Waymo, Zoox, and Tesla. Devnani noted that the increased competition from the AV industry has moderated the margins for the company to some extent, as the company is investing in its core mobility segment and also allocating significant capital towards AV initiatives. However, regardless, the firm expects Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) to exceed Gross Bookings and EBITDA estimates.

(now AXA Philippines).”

On May 31, 2023, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Malolos City, Branch 15, rendered its decision, finding the insurer liable to pay Vitarich ₱247.62 million with interest, in addition to the amount previously awarded through a summary judgment.

The insurer filed an appeal before the Court of Appeals (CA) and, without admitting any fault and to avoid a prolonged legal process, agreed with Vitarich to a settlement valued at ₱400 million.

The settlement, containing customary provisions mutually beneficial to both parties, was accepted by Vitarich President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ricardo Manuel M. Sarmiento, who has been authorized by the board of directors.

The company expects the settlement, which takes effect on Dec. 19, 2025, to have a material impact on liquidity and capital resources.

“The settlement will provide the company an estimated additional ₱196 million in net income and ₱267 million in net cash flow.”

For the first nine months of 2025, Vitarich reported revenues of ₱9.17 billion, net income of ₱120.6 million, and earnings per share of ₱0.04.

Revenues slightly declined by 0.5 percent year-on-year, primarily due to the continued drop in chicken prices, which also affected the valuation of biological assets, as well as the limited availability of day-old chicks (DOC) during the first half of the year.

This was partially offset by the company’s entry into the day-old pullet segment.

Gross profit rose to ₱1.12 billion, a modest 4.1-percent increase from the prior year, driven by favorable chicken prices during the early part of the year and improved production efficiencies in the feeds segment.

Operating income, however, dropped by 32.4 percent year-on-year to ₱240.2 million, mainly due to higher operating expenses (opex) arising from increased marketing activities, freight and handling costs, corporate events, and employee training programs.

""Walmart is slowly swapping from cardboard to plastic packaging with their pasta,"" the Redditor captions the image that shows the two packaging options side by side.

While switching from cardboard to single-use plastic may make the packaging lighter, it's still not ideal for the planet for a few reasons.

First, cardboard boxes are fully recyclable, and most municipalities process cardboard in their recycling programs. Recyclable cardboard is often made from post-consumer materials, and it has a high recyclable success rate of 70%.

Second, Walmart recently announced a shift toward electric trucks for some deliveries, helping to reduce its carbon footprint and decrease its production of carbon pollution. Shipping fully-recyclable containers on pollution-free trucks is better for the planet virtually 100% of the time.

Using plastic means dirty energy sources are still involved in the product, since plastic is a byproduct of dirty energy. And while some single-use plastic bags can be recycled, not all can. These flimsy bags often tear, making them not an ideal reuse candidate. Plastic is also a leading ocean polluter, poisoning wildlife and exacerbating the overheating of our planet.

Redditors were quick to blast the retail giant's decision. ""[Y]ou would hope the swap would be the other way,"" wrote one user.

""We are heading in the wrong direction,"" wrote another user.

One Redditor shared some insight as to why Walmart may have made the shift. ""I work in packaging,"" they wrote. ""There have been intermittent paper shortages since COVID.

Increased U.S. production doesn’t fundamentally change the picture, but it does increase the risk to Canada.”","This story is part of a selection of our top news from 2025 that we’re republishing during the holiday break. We’ll be back to our regular schedule in the new year.

With Donald Trump pledging a “Drill, Baby, Drill” agenda for fossil fuels that would pour an estimated four billion tonnes of additional climate pollution into the atmosphere, nervous private investors emerged early this year as a force that could impede the oil and gas industry from keeping Trump’s promise.

Their demands for bigger, faster returns on their fossil investments, coupled with heightened fear of declining oil demand and surging clean energy alternatives, had independent analysts and even some industry insiders concluding there’s no sudden oil boom on the horizon.

It isn’t that the industry didn’t want to ramp up production after the U.S. presidency changed hands Jan. 20. It’s that cautious investors might prevent them from doing that.

The U.S. fossil fuel industry spent US$219 million to elect the country’s next government, Yale Climate Connections reports, most of it on Republican campaigns. That was after Trump invited about 20 oil and gas executives to his Mar-a-Lago estate in April to present what one independent journalist called a “breathtakingly corrupt proposal: If they raised a billion dollars to help him retake the White House, he would roll back any policy they didn’t like when he took office.”

In the end, the election result was a bargain at one-fifth the price Trump asked the industry to pay. Not long after the dust settled on last fall’s presidential vote, the American Energy Alliance (AEA) declared itself pleased with Trump’s cabinet nominations.

“Throughout his campaign, President Trump expressed his unwavering commitment to American [fossil] energy, and his selections show how serious he is about unlocking our country’s resource potential,” AEA President Thomas Pyle said in a Nov. 26 statement. “He has chosen strong candidates to comprise his energy team,” all of whom “share a vision for energy dominance and economic growth.”

Those plans could pour an extra four billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere by 2030, Carbon Brief concluded last March.

Funnelling Cash Out of Production

But the industry’s behaviour is not matching up with its rhetoric. As far back as March 2023, with analysts predicting (as it turned out, over-predicting) $100-per-barrel oil and U.S. President Joe Biden urging companies to increase production, industry leaders were directing their record profits to investor dividends and share buybacks, diverting funds that would previously have been devoted to seeking out and developing new oilfields.

With shareholders basking in a $128-billion financial windfall, “oil executives who in years past were rewarded for investing in gigantic, long-term energy projects are now under the gun to funnel cash to investors who are increasingly convinced that the sunset of the fossil-fuel era is nigh,” Bloomberg Green reported at the time.

“At the heart of the divergence is growing concern among investors that demand for fossil fuels will peak as soon as 2030, obviating the need for multi-billion-dollar megaprojects that take decades to yield full returns,” the news story stated. “In other words, oil refineries and natural-gas fired power plants—along with the wells that feed them—risk becoming so-called stranded assets if and when they are displaced by electric cars and battery farms.”

Projections that oil consumption will peak this decade may have begun with the IEA, but the chorus of agreement now includes private energy analytics firms like Wood Mackenzie and Rystad Energy, as well as oil giants like BP and Exxon.

Against that backdrop, the June 2024 World Energy Investment report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) traced the decline in capital expenditures back nearly a decade. It said global investment in “upstream” oil exploration and extraction activity was set to fall to its lowest level since 2017, with state-owned oil corporations in the Middle East and Asia accounting for a far larger share of the total and the major private oil companies cutting investment by about one-quarter.

Among the world’s 30 biggest upstream oil producers, dividends and stock buybacks exceeded [pdf] capital spending in 2022 and 2023, with investment in exploration and extraction falling from more than 75% in 2015 to less than 50% of the total.

The same IEA report showed the world investing nearly twice as much in clean energy as it does in fossil fuels.

Borrow Billions, Hand It All Over to Investors

Now, some of the world’s biggest fossil producers are facing down a new layer of risk: with oil demand collapsing, prices staying stubbornly low, and investors still laser focused on short-term returns, four of the world’s five oil “supermajors” saw fit to borrow $15 billion to fund share buybacks between July and September, Bloomberg reported in late October.

With their quarterly profits at their lowest since 2021, down by half from record highs in 2022 and by 12% from the previous quarter, analysts said colossal fossils ExxonMobil, Chevron, TotalÉnergies, and BP wouldn’t have enough cash on hand to cover the dividends and share buybacks their investors were demanding. While Exxon and Chevron had “plenty of room to borrow to fund buybacks,” Bloomberg wrote, “the European majors have higher debt levels, allowing less room to manoeuvre,” with BP posting the worst financial performance based on its ratio of debt to capital assets.

“Borrowing to buy back shares isn’t uncommon in the oil business,” Bloomberg explained. “but a dimming outlook for oil prices next year means the cash shortfall is apt to continue over the longer term,” while investors’ expectations for immediate returns continue.

Another Day, Another Debt

Going deeper into debt to hand money over to shareholders “could be a good use of cash while companies have reasonably strong balance sheets,” Kim Fustier, head of European oil and gas equity research at HSBC Plc, told the news agency. “The question is, ‘How sustainable will it be?’”

“While it is common for companies to borrow to maintain dividends during lean periods on the premise of a cyclical recovery, it is quite another thing to do the same when the decline is structural,” agreed Guy Prince, a senior analyst on Carbon Tracker’s oil, gas and mining team, in a December 2023 analysis tracking the financial decline of 40 different petrostates—particularly Saudi Arabia.

“Falling oil demand will have varying impacts on companies,” he wrote. “However, for Saudi Aramco, with its self-imposed production targets (to shore up prices) and fixed dividend payments to the Saudi government to fund its fiscal spend (they need $80 a barrel), it is particularly painful.”

Over a nine-month span in 2024, Aramco’s financial position “has moved from net cash of $27.4 billion to net debt of $8.9 billion,” Bloomberg energy and commodities columnist Javier Blas wrote on social media. “That means in 2024 Aramco has spent ~$130 million daily that it didn’t have.”

The overall financial picture points to a rather less aggressive picture of the next four years of fossil fuel development than Trump’s and the industry’s chatter about making “American Energy Great Again”, just months after U.S. crude production set an all-time record under Biden.

Low Oil Prices Mean Falling Profits

It’ll be that much harder for Big Oil to deliver on all the big talk as long as it’s caught between two converging trends: jittery investors and relatively low prices driven by faltering demand for oil.

“Oil consumption in China—the powerhouse of world markets for the past two decades—has contracted for six straight months through September, and will grow this year at just 10% of the rate seen in 2023,” Bloomberg reported in mid-November, citing IEA analysis. Consistent with other recent analysis, a senior IEA official said it was possible that China’s oil demand had already peaked.

The result: global oil consumption will still rise this year, but at less than half the rate of 2023. And crude oil prices fell 11% between early October and mid-November.

“It’s not just the economy and the shift, the slowdown in the construction sector,” the agency’s head of oil industry and markets, Toril Bosoni, told Bloomberg TV. “It’s the transition to electric vehicles, high speed rail, and gas in trucking that is undermining Chinese oil demand growth.”

That shaky picture of future demand had the U.S. Energy Information Administration rolling back its 2025 price projection for West Texas Intermediate crude oil—from an estimate of $79.63 per barrel last September to $73.13 in October and $69.12 in December. Falling prices will only erode profits and available funds that companies are already redirecting from exploration and production to shareholder returns.

Those same price dynamics had the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries and its petrostate allies (OPEC+) balancing an “unpalatable choice” between the mounting financial pain of restraining production and the risk that bringing new oil supplies online would just drive down prices farther and faster, Bloomberg wrote in late November. By mid-December, the cartel was “gradually conceding defeat”, the news agency said, slashing its estimates of future demand growth and bringing them closer to the IEA’s—which Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman had previously dismissed as “La La Land” for its recent emphasis on net-zero scenarios.

California-based Chevron also announced a $2-billion capital expenditure cut, its first since the COVID-19 pandemic, in early December, a decision the Financial Times placed in counterpoint to Trump’s “energy dominance” agenda. That left Exxon as a major outlier, with announced plans to increase production by nearly one-fifth and continue boosting capital spending through the end of this decade.

Oil Producers Tap the Brakes

But even Exxon is throwing cold water on Trump’s pledge to drill everything, everywhere, all at once.

“I think a radical change is unlikely because the vast majority, if not everybody, is primarily focused on the economics of what they’re doing,” the company’s Upstream President Liam Mallon told a conference audience in late November. If Trump follows through on plans to open up public lands in the U.S. to oil and gas production, “You would be able to drill more, assuming you have the quality and met your economic threshold,” he added. “But I don’t think we’re going to see anybody in the ‘Drill, baby, drill!’ mode. I really don’t.”

“Maybe he has a magic recipe to push them to drill like mad,” added TotalÉnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne. But with companies committed to returning cash to shareholders, “it’s not only decisions by politicians” that will determine how much oil the U.S. produces.

The skepticism extended beyond the oil and gas executive suite.

“There is a recent media narrative that the second Trump administration will lead to a surge in U.S. oil production, with producers eager to drill and produce more when unincumbered [sic] by perceived Biden-era bureaucracy,” wrote Standard Chartered Bank Energy Analyst Emily Ashford in a post-election analysis. But U.S. oil production “has changed significantly since Trump first took office in 2017, and there are substantial barriers to rapid production increases within the time frame of a presidential term.”

Another take on that history is that, with U.S. production now at record levels, Trump can’t do much more because Biden has already given the industry pretty much everything it wants.

There are certainly steps Trump may try to take to boost the industry. But notwithstanding his campaign trail claims that U.S. oil production would have been “four, five times” higher if he had stayed in the White House after losing the 2020 election, Politico says oil companies “are already signaling they will pull back on drilling next year as crude oil prices sag.” They’re also “wary that Trump’s threatened tariffs will worsen trade tensions, driving up their costs and risking closing off foreign markets for their energy exports.”

Hazards Ahead for Canadian Oil

The global trends have Canadian politicians and analysts fretting that “three years of roaring oil prices” are coming to an end. “Both investors and companies have become used to these [high] prices,” Raoul LeBlanc vice-president at S&P Global Commodity Insights, told CBC in early November. “Whereas five years ago—let’s say 2017, 2018, and 2019—prices at $62 [a barrel] would have seemed fantastic, they don’t seem fantastic now.”

Echoing the analysis in the U.S., LeBlanc said the Canadian industry will still be expected to deliver strong returns to investors, even if it means cutting back on plans to increase production.

Around the same time, the Globe and Mail reports, University of Calgary economist Trevor Tombe said Alberta will lose C$4.5 billion in its next fiscal year if oil prices stay at their present level, making future provincial deficits “a near certainty.”

The combination of rising population and falling oil prices had Premier Danielle Smith acknowledging her government might not be able to balance its budget after projecting a $2.6-billion surplus for 2025-26—and previously promising a personal income tax cut that would reduce provincial revenue by $1.4 billion.

“It is a serious problem,” she told media. “We have a number of different pressures coming our way. And we have to be honest with people about what we’re facing.”

Hadrian Mertins-Kirkwood, senior climate policy researcher at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said the Alberta oil sands could be uniquely vulnerable as global oil demand weakens.

“There is a real and growing possibility that demand for Canadian oil exports will fall sooner and faster than anticipated,” he wrote in a November 2024 special edition of CCPA’s ShiftStorm e-newsletter, “not only because of falling demand for oil in general, but specifically because the oil sands are among the costliest and most emissions intensive sources of oil in the world.”

Mertins-Kirkwood agreed with other analysts that Trump isn’t likely to deliver the dramatic production increase he’s been touting.

“You can claim ‘Drill, baby, drill!’ all you want, but that doesn’t change the long-term demand picture, which the oil companies are well aware of,” he told The Energy Mix in an email. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see an increase in new U.S. oil and gas investment under Trump, but it won’t be a dramatic change from business-as-usual for the industry.”

Either way, Mertins-Kirkwood sees serious jeopardy ahead for Alberta and Canada.

“Canada’s fossil fuel industry has assets currently worth half a trillion dollars, and those companies also hold hundreds of billions of dollars in debt. Any decline in production ahead of plan introduces a huge risk of stranded assets,” he wrote.

Even if countries fall short of their declared 2050 deadline to hit net-zero emissions, “We’re going to see a big risk of stranded assets in Canada within 20 years. Increased U.S. production doesn’t fundamentally change the picture, but it does increase the risk to Canada.”

This story is part of a selection of our top news from 2025 that we’re republishing during the holiday break. We’ll be back to our regular schedule in the new year.

With Donald Trump pledging a “Drill, Baby, Drill” agenda for fossil fuels that would pour an estimated four billion tonnes of additional climate pollution into the atmosphere, nervous private investors emerged early this year as a force that could impede the oil and gas industry from keeping Trump’s promise.

Their demands for bigger, faster returns on their fossil investments, coupled with heightened fear of declining oil demand and surging clean energy alternatives, had independent analysts and even some industry insiders concluding there’s no sudden oil boom on the horizon.

It isn’t that the industry didn’t want to ramp up production after the U.S. presidency changed hands Jan. 20. It’s that cautious investors might prevent them from doing that.

The U.S. fossil fuel industry spent US$219 million to elect the country’s next government, Yale Climate Connections reports, most of it on Republican campaigns. That was after Trump invited about 20 oil and gas executives to his Mar-a-Lago estate in April to present what one independent journalist called a “breathtakingly corrupt proposal: If they raised a billion dollars to help him retake the White House, he would roll back any policy they didn’t like when he took office.”

In the end, the election result was a bargain at one-fifth the price Trump asked the industry to pay. Not long after the dust settled on last fall’s presidential vote, the American Energy Alliance (AEA) declared itself pleased with Trump’s cabinet nominations.

“Throughout his campaign, President Trump expressed his unwavering commitment to American [fossil] energy, and his selections show how serious he is about unlocking our country’s resource potential,” AEA President Thomas Pyle said in a Nov. 26 statement. “He has chosen strong candidates to comprise his energy team,” all of whom “share a vision for energy dominance and economic growth.”

Those plans could pour an extra four billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere by 2030, Carbon Brief concluded last March.

Funnelling Cash Out of Production

But the industry’s behaviour is not matching up with its rhetoric. As far back as March 2023, with analysts predicting (as it turned out, over-predicting) $100-per-barrel oil and U.S. President Joe Biden urging companies to increase production, industry leaders were directing their record profits to investor dividends and share buybacks, diverting funds that would previously have been devoted to seeking out and developing new oilfields.

With shareholders basking in a $128-billion financial windfall, “oil executives who in years past were rewarded for investing in gigantic, long-term energy projects are now under the gun to funnel cash to investors who are increasingly convinced that the sunset of the fossil-fuel era is nigh,” Bloomberg Green reported at the time.

“At the heart of the divergence is growing concern among investors that demand for fossil fuels will peak as soon as 2030, obviating the need for multi-billion-dollar megaprojects that take decades to yield full returns,” the news story stated. “In other words, oil refineries and natural-gas fired power plants—along with the wells that feed them—risk becoming so-called stranded assets if and when they are displaced by electric cars and battery farms.”

Projections that oil consumption will peak this decade may have begun with the IEA, but the chorus of agreement now includes private energy analytics firms like Wood Mackenzie and Rystad Energy, as well as oil giants like BP and Exxon.

Against that backdrop, the June 2024 World Energy Investment report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) traced the decline in capital expenditures back nearly a decade. It said global investment in “upstream” oil exploration and extraction activity was set to fall to its lowest level since 2017, with state-owned oil corporations in the Middle East and Asia accounting for a far larger share of the total and the major private oil companies cutting investment by about one-quarter.

Among the world’s 30 biggest upstream oil producers, dividends and stock buybacks exceeded [pdf] capital spending in 2022 and 2023, with investment in exploration and extraction falling from more than 75% in 2015 to less than 50% of the total.

The same IEA report showed the world investing nearly twice as much in clean energy as it does in fossil fuels.

Borrow Billions, Hand It All Over to Investors

Now, some of the world’s biggest fossil producers are facing down a new layer of risk: with oil demand collapsing, prices staying stubbornly low, and investors still laser focused on short-term returns, four of the world’s five oil “supermajors” saw fit to borrow $15 billion to fund share buybacks between July and September, Bloomberg reported in late October.

With their quarterly profits at their lowest since 2021, down by half from record highs in 2022 and by 12% from the previous quarter, analysts said colossal fossils ExxonMobil, Chevron, TotalÉnergies, and BP wouldn’t have enough cash on hand to cover the dividends and share buybacks their investors were demanding. While Exxon and Chevron had “plenty of room to borrow to fund buybacks,” Bloomberg wrote, “the European majors have higher debt levels, allowing less room to manoeuvre,” with BP posting the worst financial performance based on its ratio of debt to capital assets.

“Borrowing to buy back shares isn’t uncommon in the oil business,” Bloomberg explained. “but a dimming outlook for oil prices next year means the cash shortfall is apt to continue over the longer term,” while investors’ expectations for immediate returns continue.

Another Day, Another Debt

Going deeper into debt to hand money over to shareholders “could be a good use of cash while companies have reasonably strong balance sheets,” Kim Fustier, head of European oil and gas equity research at HSBC Plc, told the news agency. “The question is, ‘How sustainable will it be?’”

“While it is common for companies to borrow to maintain dividends during lean periods on the premise of a cyclical recovery, it is quite another thing to do the same when the decline is structural,” agreed Guy Prince, a senior analyst on Carbon Tracker’s oil, gas and mining team, in a December 2023 analysis tracking the financial decline of 40 different petrostates—particularly Saudi Arabia.

“Falling oil demand will have varying impacts on companies,” he wrote. “However, for Saudi Aramco, with its self-imposed production targets (to shore up prices) and fixed dividend payments to the Saudi government to fund its fiscal spend (they need $80 a barrel), it is particularly painful.”

Over a nine-month span in 2024, Aramco’s financial position “has moved from net cash of $27.4 billion to net debt of $8.9 billion,” Bloomberg energy and commodities columnist Javier Blas wrote on social media. “That means in 2024 Aramco has spent ~$130 million daily that it didn’t have.”

The overall financial picture points to a rather less aggressive picture of the next four years of fossil fuel development than Trump’s and the industry’s chatter about making “American Energy Great Again”, just months after U.S. crude production set an all-time record under Biden.

Low Oil Prices Mean Falling Profits

It’ll be that much harder for Big Oil to deliver on all the big talk as long as it’s caught between two converging trends: jittery investors and relatively low prices driven by faltering demand for oil.

“Oil consumption in China—the powerhouse of world markets for the past two decades—has contracted for six straight months through September, and will grow this year at just 10% of the rate seen in 2023,” Bloomberg reported in mid-November, citing IEA analysis. Consistent with other recent analysis, a senior IEA official said it was possible that China’s oil demand had already peaked.

The result: global oil consumption will still rise this year, but at less than half the rate of 2023. And crude oil prices fell 11% between early October and mid-November.

“It’s not just the economy and the shift, the slowdown in the construction sector,” the agency’s head of oil industry and markets, Toril Bosoni, told Bloomberg TV. “It’s the transition to electric vehicles, high speed rail, and gas in trucking that is undermining Chinese oil demand growth.”

That shaky picture of future demand had the U.S. Energy Information Administration rolling back its 2025 price projection for West Texas Intermediate crude oil—from an estimate of $79.63 per barrel last September to $73.13 in October and $69.12 in December. Falling prices will only erode profits and available funds that companies are already redirecting from exploration and production to shareholder returns.

Those same price dynamics had the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries and its petrostate allies (OPEC+) balancing an “unpalatable choice” between the mounting financial pain of restraining production and the risk that bringing new oil supplies online would just drive down prices farther and faster, Bloomberg wrote in late November. By mid-December, the cartel was “gradually conceding defeat”, the news agency said, slashing its estimates of future demand growth and bringing them closer to the IEA’s—which Saudi Energy Minister Abdulaziz bin Salman had previously dismissed as “La La Land” for its recent emphasis on net-zero scenarios.

That left Exxon as a major outlier, with announced plans to increase production by nearly one-fifth and continue boosting capital spending through the end of this decade.

In the first nine months of 2025, global M&A activity was up 10 percent over what it was in the same period in 2024, despite the headwinds of geopolitical tensions and tariff policies that seemed to change every few weeks. The tech sector was especially busy with deal-making this year as companies looked to find a way to leverage the AI boom.

But some activity stood out from the rest. Here’s a look at the deals that made this year so unique.

Intel and the U.S. government

The Trump Administration surprised both the tech world and Wall Street in August, announcing that the federal government was taking a 10 percent stake in the chipmaker. (That was especially astonishing, as Trump had, just weeks before, strongly criticized Intel’s CEO on social media, saying he was “highly CONFLICTED and must resign.”)

The government picked up 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece, making it one of the company’s largest shareholders. The deal has already paid off, with the government’s stake now worth nearly $9 billion more than it paid for the stock.

Stargate

OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle, in January, jointly announced a massive AI data center project called “Stargate,” in which the companies plan to invest up to $500 billion over the coming years to develop AI infrastructure in the U.S.

Stargate, the companies said, will create 100,000 jobs. Plans were announced in September for five new AI data centers. Stargate will be set up as a separate company, which OpenAI said in a social media post “will not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.”

OpenAI and Oracle

In September, OpenAI signed a contract with Oracle to purchase $300 billion in computing power over the next five years, one of the largest cloud contracts ever. The contact will begin in 2027, but it did draw some concern from some analysts, who noted the value of the deal was much greater than OpenAI’s current revenue and Oracle will need to take on substantial debt to build out the hardware and infrastructure for the project. News of the agreement sent Oracle stock up 43 percent when it was announced. (It has since lost all of those gains.)

Pepsi and Poppi

Founded in 2020, Poppi started as an experiment in Allison Ellsworth’s kitchen, an attempt to make gut-healthy drinks that tasted good. The probiotic soda quickly grew into a popular, nationally recognized brand during the pandemic, landing Poppi at No. 148 on this year’s Inc. 5000 list, with a three-year growth rate of 2,638 percent. In May, Ellsworth and her husband Stephen, who is also a co-founder, sold the company to Pepsi for $1.95 billion.

Prada and Versace

The news in April that Prada would buy Versace for $1.51 billion was the ending to a very long story. Prada began chasing the luxury fashion house during the pandemic, but the parties couldn’t make the deal work. When Versace parent Capri’s sale to Tapestry was scuttled due to antitrust concerns, Prada tried again and was able to negotiate a price that was lower than the $2 billion Capri paid for the brand in 2018. The acquisition closed earlier this month.

Dick’s Sporting Goods and Foot Locker

Dick’s Sporting Goods had a strong 2025, raising its full-year sales growth guidance last month to a range of 3.5 to 4 percent up from 2 to 3.5 percent previously. Its acquisition of struggling competitor Foot Locker in May for $2.4 billion gave it a competitive advantage in the Nike sneaker market as well as access to international markets and a wider customer base. Foot Locker will continue to operate as a standalone business, though Dick’s does plan to close an undisclosed number of stores to protect the company’s profits.

Sycamore Partners and Walgreens Boots Alliance

Private equity firm Sycamore’s $10 billion purchase of the pharmaceutical chain in March ended almost a century of Walgreens being a publicly traded company. Walgreens, at one point in time, boasted a market cap of nearly $100 billion, but changes to the healthcare industry, acquisitions of rivals and reduced margins on drug sales shrank that number precipitously. Sycamore has a history of buying distressed companies, with other holdings including Staples, Nine West and Talbots.

Keurig Dr Pepper and JDE Peets

Keurig Dr Pepper’s U.S. coffee business needed some help, so it made an $18 billion bet in August that the Dutch coffee and tea company could boost earnings. Keurig Dr Pepper owns Green Mountain Coffee (as well as Dr Pepper, 7Up and Snapple), which has seen sales decline in recent years. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2026, after which Keurig Dr Pepper will split its coffee and other beverage units into two separate companies, both of which will remain listed on U.S. stock exchanges.

The ChatGPT firm has announced it’s hiring a Head of Preparedness. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman said the position would work on mitigating the growing threat of AI being used aggressively by bad actors in the world of cybersecurity. He claimed we are now “seeing models get so good at computer security they are beginning to find critical vulnerabilities.”

The CEO’s statements about LLMs posing growing risks to cyberdefenders are backed up by other firms in the industry. Last month, OpenAI rival Anthropic posted a report about how a Chinese state-sponsored group manipulated its Claude Code tool into attempting infiltration of “roughly thirty global targets,” including large tech companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers, and government agencies, “without substantial human intervention.”

Altman called for candidates who “want to help the world figure out how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting-edge capabilities” while still “ensuring attackers can't use them for harm.” According to the job spec, other major risk areas the successful candidate is set to work on include “biosecurity.” In this context, biosecurity could mean advanced AI systems being used to design bioweapons, a risk more than 100 scientists from universities and organizations across the planet have warned about.

Whoever lands the new role will be expected to keep up with evolving AI risks, and oversee the company's ""preparedness framework as new risks, capabilities, or external expectations emerge.""

Though the compensation package on offer looks generous—north of $500k plus equity—it doesn’t look like a gig for the faint of heart. Altman said it is set to be “a stressful job” that will see the successful candidate “jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.”

There’s a good chance the CEO isn’t exaggerating when it comes to the position’s stress levels. Reports about burnout at the AI firm have been building for some time, as per reports from publications like Wired. Former technical team executives like Calvin French-Owen have posted first-hand accounts of a secretive, high-pressure environment, with a heavy emphasis on Twitter ""vibes"", alongside anecdotal reports of 12-hour days being plentiful on social media.

It also offers more rest: Saturday was the Hawks’ league-leading 33rd game and they only have four back-to-backs after Jan. 3.","ATLANTA — The irony was hard to miss: The visiting coach in Atlanta Saturday night was New York’s Mike Brown, who was fired by Sacramento exactly one year ago to the day after his team lost a fifth consecutive home game.

Welp.

Quin Snyder’s seat hasn’t been rumored to be hot, but the Hawks lost their fifth straight home game and sixth straight overall on Saturday, 128-125 to the Knicks, as Nickeil Alexander-Walkers’s 3-point attempt rattled out just before the buzzer. That this losing streak has coincided with the return of Trae Young for the last four games — something that theoretically should make the Hawks significantly better — only adds to the local angst about this team.

Instead of moving up in the East hierarchy, as many expected at the start of the season, Atlanta is stuck in extremely familiar territory: jousting with the Heat and Bulls for positioning in the play-in tournament. This home losing streak began with two losses to Chicago, including one where the Hawks gave up a staggering 152 points. One way to prove you’re beyond playing your annual elimination game against the Bulls in April is to beat them in December.

Atlanta is now 15-18, in tenth place in the East, and the upcoming schedule offers few reprieves with games against the Thunder, Wolves and Knicks again. Eight of the next 10 games are on the road; eight of the next nine are against teams with winning records. A home game against New Orleans on Jan. 7 might be the only one in which the Hawks are favored. Yikes.

The Hawks haven’t always played badly in this stretch; they lost at the buzzer to a good Knicks team and were beaten by a phantom call in the second loss to the Bulls. The underlying stats still say they’re more an average team than a bad one — 16th in offense, 17th in defense, 18th in Net Rating.

But they also face-planted in a winnable, rested game against Miami and played no defense in the first loss to the Bulls. And more importantly, the expectations were for more this year after acquiring Kristaps Porziņģis and Nickeil Alexander-Walker in the offseason.

That said, the feeling internally after Saturday’s game was slightly different from what you might expect; Atlanta took encouragement after rallying from an 18-point deficit to briefly take the lead in the fourth quarter, coming on the heels of a team meeting after the moribund loss to Miami the night before.

“We had a real sit-down with the whole crew and said we need to be better,” said Alexander-Walker, “and I think you can feel it in the game, in the stretch where we were able to kind of stop the bleeding, we fought.”

“I was proud of how we competed,” said Snyder. “You would like to get a win because that’s affirming of how you played, but we did the things we need to do to be successful.”

“We told each other we need to be serious,” said Jalen Johnson. “A lot of guys spoke. I think it was a good sign.”

Snyder may have also finally landed on something that works rotationally after experimenting, mostly unsuccessfully, with his bench units for much of the year. He finally staggered Young and Johnson to keep one on the court at all times, avoiding some of the bench unit disasters that have plagued the Hawks in previous losses. Guards Keaton Wallace and Luke Kennard, who featured in some of the worst-performing units and have a minus-11.5 per 100 net rating as a two-man unit, combined for just eight total minutes over the last two nights.

“We had more urgency; we were more dialed in,” said Onyeka Okongwu of the Hawks’ rally. The 6-foot-8 center had 31 points and 14 rebounds despite giving up many inches.

“We need to challenge ourselves to play a whole game and not go through lapses.”

Alas, the Hawks face a size deficit every night without the 7-3 Porziņģis, whose POTS syndrome has him sidelined; he has only played 13 games this year. That and a season-ending injury to third center N’Faly Dante have left the Hawks bereft of size, an especially noticeable deficit against New York’s Karl-Anthony Towns and Mitchell Robinson. Atlanta is 27th in Rebound Rate, ahead of only Milwaukee, Sacramento and Washington, and their nightly Ls in the possession battle have made for a burdensome math problem.

The flip side of the Hawks’ tough upcoming schedule is that it gets Charmin soft starting in February, with a surfeit of Charlottes and Washingtons on the docket and only 10 road games after the All-Star break. It also offers more rest: Saturday was the Hawks’ league-leading 33rd game and they only have four back-to-backs after Jan. 3. But they may be down so bad by then that it won’t matter.

The tough schedule also raises the stakes for what might be next for this franchise, whether at the trade deadline or in the offseason. Atlanta has to make its deadline decisions without the benefit of seeing how many wins its soft late schedule might yield. Meanwhile, Young’s return has yet to impact the bottom line while perhaps detracting some from the electric Johnson, especially late in games. Young’s $49 million player option looms as a major hinge point for the offseason.

Both Johnson and Young have also been guilty of glaring defensive gaffes. Here’s Young standing at the free-throw line while Miami runs out for a lay-up in Friday’s fourth quarter:

Meanwhile, when Snyder lamented after the Miami game that the Hawks would stop a driver and then get beat on a back cut, it wasn’t hard to identify what play was on his mind. Here’s Johnson falling asleep on the weak side, something that’s happened way too often this year in what has otherwise been an All-Star-caliber campaign:

Porziņģis, of course, is another giant question mark. He’s an All-Star-caliber weapon when available, but on an expiring $31 million deal that could end up being an important trade chip at the deadline.

Atlanta still owes its first-round pick this year to San Antonio from the Dejounte Murray trade, so they have no incentive for a fire sale. But if this team can’t escape the gravitational field of the play-in tournament for a fifth consecutive season, it raises an important question for the front office as it tries to build around a young core, a likely high lottery pick from New Orleans or Milwaukee and … it remains to be seen what else.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/28003002/GettyImages-2252986226.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-28 08:58:23.038951

At the same time, the civil service has grown sharply, and chipmaker ASML has emerged as the fastest-growing private employer.

Defense employed 74,333 full-time equivalent positions at the end of last year, nearly 20 percent more than five years earlier. In the previous de Volkskrant survey, defense and the police were roughly equal at about 62,000 full-time jobs each. Police staffing has since risen by 5.5 percent to 64,618.

“The armed forces face the task of strengthening themselves at high speed,” a Defense Ministry spokesperson said. “It is therefore positive to see that there is a lot of interest in a job with defense.”

Ahold Delhaize ranks third overall and is the largest private employer, with about 97,000 workers in the Netherlands, equivalent to roughly 38,000 full-time jobs.

The civil service expanded strongly, with central government employment rising from more than 125,000 full-time jobs in 2020 to over 157,000 last year. The Tax and Customs Administration employs more than 28,000 full-time workers, UWV nearly 20,000, and the Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management more than 16,000.

Industry employment continued to shrink at companies such as VDL and Philips, both below 9,000 full-time jobs, and at Tata Steel, which dropped below 10,000.

Mergers old and new reshaped the agency landscape; regulators pushed back against the giants; and Google quietly admitted something few thought possible - that the cookie era might be here to stay after all.

Omnicom and IPG: The year’s defining merger

Last December’s news that Omnicom would acquire IPG sent shockwaves through Madison Avenue. The deal, worth an estimated USD$25bn, promised to create the world’s largest agency network - a marketing behemoth with combined billings dwarfing even WPP’s. Unsurprisingly, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stepped in, flagging concerns that the tie-up could limit competition across media buying, creative services, and data management.

For months, the transaction hovered in limbo. But a revised framework for “cross-stack ad competition” introduced midyear gave the merger new life. By late summer, the FTC cleared the deal, followed in December by unconditional approval from the European Commission. Almost immediately, Omnicom announced a sweeping restructure: 4,000 roles set to go before year-end as it moves to consolidate overlapping units and unify its data strategy under a single global platform.

Consolidation everywhere you look

The mergers kept coming. French-based Equativ sealed its long-discussed union with Sharethrough, forming one of the largest independent ad tech platforms outside the walled gardens. The combined group now boasts significant reach across CTV, programmatic, and supply optimisation.

Meanwhile, Publicis made headlines with its acquisition of Lotame. The move adds Lotame’s data reservoir - roughly 1.6 billion user profiles - to the Groupe’s increasingly ID-driven data stack. Publicis wasted no time folding those audience graphs into its Epsilon offering, pitching enhanced precision targeting just as fragmentation across identifiers reached new highs.

The battle for Warner Bros

In media, the year’s most extraordinary rumour mill centred on Warner Bros Discovery, which officially put itself up for sale. Both Netflix and Paramount Skydance made plays - and Netflix seemed to have the agreement in place. Paramount then lobbed in a USD$108.4bn hostile bid, aiming to outmuscle Netflix’s already massive USD$72bn offer. The board, though, recommended rejecting Paramount’s offer - but few expect this story to end before 2026.

TikTok survives again - with a new flag

Across the Atlantic, political drama continued to define TikTok’s fate. In September, a newly re-elected Donald Trump signed an executive order forcing Chinese parent company ByteDance to transfer US ownership to American investors. The move, framed as a national security measure, effectively prevented a TikTok shutdown in the States - and marked the culmination of a years-long tug of war over the app’s future.

ByteDance eventually reached a binding deal with groups including Oracle, Silver Lake, and MGX. If completed in early 2026, the agreement will create a separate joint venture for TikTok’s US business, finally putting the app’s legal limbo to rest - at least for now.

Google’s rough year in court

No year-in-review would be complete without Google’s legal woes, and 2025 delivered them in spades. The search giant faced a crushing verdict in April, when Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled that it maintained two illegal monopolies across ad tech - one in publisher ad servers, another in exchange technology.

The decision unleashed fresh lawsuits from Magnite and PubMatic, both seeking damages for what they describe as years of exclusionary practices.

Yet the more draconian remedies - a forced breakup or Chrome divestiture - seem increasingly unlikely. Judge Amit Mehta spared the browser from sale in Google’s parallel search antitrust trial, and Brinkema has signalled similar hesitation in the ad tech case. Pending verdicts aside, the industry’s response has been pragmatic: frustration, but little shock. The perceived imbalance between regulators’ power and Big Tech’s legal muscle remains, for now, intact.

AI upends traffic and trust

While courts debated competition, the open web faced a different kind of existential challenge. As AI chatbots and search tools proliferated, referral traffic to publishers cratered. Appfigures and SimilarWeb both recorded steep double-digit declines in click-throughs to news sites across major markets, with much of that traffic diverted to AI-generated summaries.

Publishers responded with lawsuits, block lists, and pleas for licensing deals. Yet the scraping continued and 2025 became, by consensus, the year that open access content was effectively subsumed into large language model training data. One board member of the Independent Publishers Alliance estimated that Google’s new AI-powered search could push a third of its members into closure within a year.

What AI giveth in efficiency, it taketh away in discoverability.

The cookie that wouldn’t crumble

And finally, the year’s most unexpected twist: the third-party cookie lived to see another day. After half a decade of phased plans, pilot schemes, and developer summits, Google officially scrapped its deprecation timeline. Privacy Sandbox was quietly wound down, its core tools shuttered.

The decision, reportedly tied to both antitrust pressure and publisher backlash, sent shockwaves across the ecosystem. After years spent preparing for a “post-cookie world”, advertisers and platforms alike found themselves back where they started - albeit older, wiser, and more cynical about Google’s willingness to change its own rules.

For some, that retreat marked the end of an era. For others, it was a fitting conclusion to a year defined by circular upheaval: consolidation without clarity, innovation without confidence, and regulation without resolve.

If tech companies want launch events to matter in 2026, they need to stop giving us Keynotes that could have been emails or overcomplicating them to the point where we lose interest.
Keep consumer launches and developer events separate Google's I/O and Apple's WWDC keep developer updates separate from their launch events, but they sometimes blur the line between the two.
So, for 2026, companies should totally keep the live demos.","In 2025, Google, Apple, Samsung, and everyone else who announced new tech products delivered beautifully curated keynotes that told us exactly what they wanted us to hear about the said devices.

I agree that Google went above and beyond this year for its Pixel 10 launch, delivering something that felt less like a Keynote and more like a massive production hosted by Jimmy Fallon. On the opposite end, Meta literally winged it with live demos of their new smart glasses. While the demos didn't go as planned, they stayed fairly realistic, which is what we, as consumers who pay a hefty price for electronics, would appreciate seeing.

If tech companies want launch events to matter in 2026, they need to stop giving us Keynotes that could have been emails or overcomplicating them to the point where we lose interest. Instead, they need to offer more clarity and a better understanding of how an average person seeking to buy a new anything will perceive and use these products.

Here's what I'd love to see change in 2026 — and what's worth keeping.

Give it to me straight — in plain English

Too often, companies end up explaining features the way they'd talk to engineers and not, well, us. We hear about ""tokens per second,"" model sizes, or how ""Siri now has a deeper understanding of your personal context.""

There's a ton of technical jargon, and not much about how those things show up in the real world. Launch events need to answer questions when explaining a new feature — It comes down to the basics: ""Why would I actually need it, when would I use it, and what problem would it solve?""

If I don't understand the practicality of a new feature and how it would help me in the real world, then what's the point of having some elaborate speech about it?

Take Google's Gemini, for instance: instead of telling me it's faster, smarter, and more ""multimodal,"" tell me whether Gemini can look at a photo I took and explain why it looks bad and how to fix it before I share it. Even Samsung and Apple end up using loads of jargon in their Keynotes.

Apple loves to show off those emotionally hitting polished stories — the Apple Watch saving a life, the iPhone shooting a fancy music video (with tons of extra gear, post-production edits, of course). Samsung often bombards viewers with so many features so quickly, with little guidance on which actually matter.

But they skip the messy part: regular people trying to use that same tech and ending up with a terrible photo, bad lighting, or just a picture that looks nothing like the ad. In 2026, I want to see companies balance those magical tales with what these features actually look like for a totally average user. Because great stories definitely make people care, but great explanations push people to buy the product.

Keep consumer launches and developer events separate

Google's I/O and Apple's WWDC keep developer updates separate from their launch events, but they sometimes blur the line between the two. For example, this year's I/O featured major product announcements, including the launch of Android 16, a demonstration of Gemini's multimodal capabilities, and a preview of a prototype of Google's XR glasses.

This mix at an event aimed just for developers is definitely cool. Google's probably trying to get more than just coders interested in I/O, but it's also leaving people confused about whether they should be glued to I/O or just watch the ""Made by Google"" for consumer-focused announcements. If you ask me, I'd say keep the two separate, don't overcomplicate it. That way, the audience knows what to expect at each event and won't miss anything of interest.

Keep the live demos — even if they fail

Both Google and Meta actually tried live demos in 2025, and sometimes, despite practicing it a zillion times before D-day, they don't go as planned. WiFi dropped, or connectivity lagged, leading to awkward pauses during a live show.

But that necessarily isn't failure. While people pick on these moments to criticize the company, make a ton of memes, they can also work to the company's favor. It showed us the reality that mistakes happen — especially with common issues like connectivity problems, and this to me comes across as more authentic and raw, rather than scripted videos.

It also gives companies a real-world moment to look at what works and what still needs work before a product reaches consumers.

So, for 2026, companies should totally keep the live demos. But they could try to swap out the celebrities for everyday people to make things more relevant for someone watching on their couch at home. You know, parents, students—those who don't care about the techy buzzwords but who will actually be using these cool new devices and features.

And just keep things simple, to the point, showing us how features will help normal people, rather than over-the-top shows with so much going on that people forget about it as soon as the show's over.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DyDo9YEbk6cWzp3Y9jRBvW-2560-80.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 12:13:32.249701

The move was orderly on below-average holiday volume, extending a recent winning streak. But with the stock already up over 11% in the prior six sessions, is this merely a tactical news-driven pop or the start of a new leg higher into year-end?

The Groq licensing agreement is a significant strategic move, reinforcing NVIDIA’s dominance in the AI inference market. By acquiring talent and access to Groq’s high-performance technology, NVIDIA is proactively neutralizing a potential competitor and widening its competitive moat.

NVIDIA will pay $20 billion to license Groq’s AI inference technology and hire key personnel.

The deal integrates Groq’s expertise in Language Processing Units (LPUs), enhancing NVDA’s capabilities.

This move is seen as a defensive strategy to address threats from specialized ASIC chip manufacturers.

But here is the interesting part. You are reading about this 1.0% move after it happened. The market has already priced in the news.

Trade Mechanics & Money Flow

Trade Mechanics: What Happened?

The trading mechanics on December 26th suggest a quiet, holiday-thinned market, with institutional players making targeted bets rather than a broad retail chase. The relatively low volume indicates a lack of aggressive, widespread participation, typical for the period between Christmas and New Year’s.

Trading volume was subdued at approximately 137-139 million shares, well below the daily average.

Options activity shows strong bullish sentiment, with significant open interest in calls at the $195 and $200 strike prices.

A large block trade of 26,000 calls expiring in September 2025 suggests institutional conviction in long-term upside.

How Is The Money Flowing?

The footprint of this move appears to be primarily institutional. The subdued volume combined with large, strategic options trades points towards smart money positioning for future growth rather than a retail-driven frenzy.

The quiet nature of the 1.0% move on low volume is characteristic of institutional accumulation.

Retail participation was noted, but the significant block trades in the options market indicate a larger institutional hand.

The stock closed near the psychologically important $190 level, setting up a potential test of higher resistance.

What Next?

FOLLOW. The next key level to watch is $200. This is not just a psychological barrier but also where a significant cluster of call option open interest resides. A decisive break above this level, particularly on increasing volume, would signal a continuation of the uptrend, likely forcing options market makers to hedge their positions and potentially creating a gamma squeeze that could accelerate the move higher.

I think President Trump, you know, his his, he's not a career politician.

The press release also reminded passengers that American Airlines is investing in several projects at DFW airport.","This holiday season has been particularly stressful for those planning to catch a flight. A major winter storm, Storm Devin, hit many parts of the Northeast and Midwest immediately after Christmas, leading to thousands of cancellations nationwide — although many U.S. airlines reacted to the storm in the best way possible for passengers.

Meanwhile, on Friday, December 26, American Airlines was forced to cancel 109 flights, one of the highest numbers of cancellations, according to FlightAware. This was in part due to its high number of departures compared to other carriers.

American Airlines has since issued a press release announcing a new flight schedule for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), which will provide “greater resilience and less adverse impact” in the event of bad weather. Here's a closer look at this new plan and how it will affect passengers.

American Airlines Reacts To 109 Cancellations With A New Flight Schedule

On Friday, December 26, American Airlines announced significant changes at its largest and busiest hub, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. The carrier plans to invest millions of dollars to offer a smoother airport experience, enhance connections for travelers on layovers, and improve resilience in case of weather disruptions.

For years, American Airlines’ schedule at its Dallas hub has been divided into nine banks, a term referring to a group of flights operating roughly at the same time. Beginning in April, the airline will introduce a 13-bank structure, adding new time options. Changes to the schedule will become visible today, Saturday, December 27.

What does this mean for passengers?

American Airlines customers will be able to choose from more departures during ""highly desired"" time windows, as well as fewer early-morning flights. According to the carrier, this is ""especially good news for customers making morning connections through DFW.""

These changes will also help the airline recover better when bad weather hits.

“No other airline recovers from bad weather and irregular operations better than American, and the airline has demonstrated that time and time again,"" the company's press release states.

Now, the airline has stated that its new schedule structure will ensure it will ""recover even quicker and get customers on their way as soon as the weather clears."" American Airlines is also investing millions of dollars in remote deplaning capability, which will help the carrier divert fewer flights away from DFW.

American Airlines Canceled 3% Of Its Flights On Boxing Day

On Boxing Day, Friday, December 26, New York, along with many parts of the Northeast and Midwest, was hit by a heavy winter storm, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations. According to the latest advisory from the National Weather Service, published at 5:20 a.m. EST on Saturday, December 27, a winter storm warning will remain in effect until 10 a.m.

Delta Air Lines was the U.S. carrier with the most cancellations on Friday, with 254 flights canceled, representing about 7% of its scheduled departures for the day. JetBlue followed it with 232 cancellations, representing 23% of its total flights.

American Airlines, United Airlines, and Southwest only had to cancel 3% of their scheduled departures. The airports that were hit hardest were John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), which reported 159 and 107 cancellations, respectively.

At the moment, it seems that travel disruptions will continue today. Flight Radar reports 131 cancellations at JFK, 85 at La Guardia Airport (LGA), and 70 at Newark Liberty (EWR). For now, American Airlines has been forced to cancel 1% of its departures, for a total of 57 flights, while JetBlue is at the top with 159 cancellations. However, American, along with United Airlines and JetBlue, have responded in kind to passengers amid all the Storm Devin cancellations; the three told Reuters they have waived change and re-booking fees.

According to American Airlines’ press release, bad weather is a serious issue for the carrier, especially at DFW, where thunderstorms have recently forced the entire airport to pause. Apart from the new flight schedule at DFW, the carrier is also investing in a better airport experience for its customers and smoother connections.

American Airlines Is Focusing On Better Connections And Airport Experience

Apart from the new schedule, American Airlines has also announced a few other changes to make connections easier and improve the airport experience for travelers. The new schedule is now reducing extremely short layovers, leading to a less stressful travel experience.

In addition, the company launched an AI tool at DFW Airport in May 2025. This helps connecting passengers get to their second flight by ensuring pilots wait for them in case of delays, when possible. The company has recently announced it will now use this technology in five additional airports.

The press release also reminded passengers that American Airlines is investing in several projects at DFW airport. These include modernizing its airport facilities and adding extra piers, resulting in 31 new gates by 2030.

While American Airlines claims to be the best U.S. carrier at handling flight disruptions caused by bad weather, on December 27, it reported the same cancellation rate as United Airlines and Southwest Airlines. Only time will tell whether this new schedule will make a real difference.",https://static0.thetravelimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2233806869-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-28 04:57:54.001434

Ethiopian Airlines has marked a significant milestone by completing Africa’s first full strip-and-paint process on its Airbus A350-900 fleet, setting a new standard in aircraft maintenance on the continent. This achievement highlights the airline’s advanced maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) capabilities, reinforcing its leadership in operational efficiency and fleet durability.

Advancing Maintenance Capabilities

The full strip-and-paint procedure involves the meticulous removal of all existing paint layers, followed by a comprehensive repainting of the aircraft. This complex process is essential for preserving the structural integrity of the aircraft, enhancing its aesthetic appeal, and improving fuel efficiency by reducing aerodynamic drag. By investing in the necessary technology and infrastructure to perform such high-level maintenance internally, Ethiopian Airlines has significantly reduced its dependence on external service providers, thereby strengthening its competitive position within the aviation sector.

The airline’s technical team ensured that the process adhered to stringent international standards, underscoring Ethiopian Airlines’ unwavering commitment to safety and operational excellence. The Airbus A350-900, renowned for its fuel efficiency and cutting-edge technology, forms a critical component of the airline’s long-haul fleet. Maintaining these aircraft in optimal condition is vital to delivering a safe and comfortable experience for passengers.

Industry Context and Strategic Implications

This development occurs amid heightened industry scrutiny over quality and software issues affecting Airbus’s A320 family. While Ethiopian Airlines’ current focus remains on the A350-900, the broader concerns surrounding Airbus products may prompt competitors and regulators to intensify their examination of fleet maintenance practices. Such scrutiny could influence investor confidence, as apprehensions about potential operational disruptions and the impact on Airbus’s reputation may affect purchasing decisions and fleet management strategies across the global aviation industry.

Ethiopian Airlines’ successful execution of the full strip-and-paint process on both its Boeing 787 and Airbus A350-900 fleets places it among a select group of global carriers capable of conducting such advanced maintenance in-house. This strategic initiative aligns with the airline’s broader vision to expand its MRO capabilities, fostering greater self-sufficiency and resilience in an increasingly competitive market.

Between Dec. 26 and Dec. 31, returns are expected to rise by 25% to 35% compared with returns between Nov. 1 and Dec. 12, Adobe said, and it expects returns to remain elevated through the first two weeks of January, up 8% to 15%.

According to a report from the National Retail Federation, about 19% of online sales are expected to be returned in 2025.

But as shoppers head back to stores, they may find that some stores charge fees for returns.

Gift returns: Can I return items for free?

Most retailers, such as Amazon, Target and Walmart, have free returns for most items. For the holiday season, many of these retailers have an extended return window that expires in January.

Nordstrom and other department stores also do free returns, especially when done in person.

Why it matters: Social media has been full of questions about what the unusual arrangement means for Groq employees — both those heading to Nvidia and those staying put.

Catch up quick: Groq and Nvidia on Wednesday announced a ""non-exclusive licensing agreement,"" with media reports accurately pegging the deal value at around $20 billion.

The companies said that Groq CEO Jonathan Ross and president Sunny Madra would join Nvidia, while Groq would continue to operate as a standalone company led by new CEO Simon Edwards (who had been CFO).

It's an unusual structure, but the latest in a recent spate of Big AI deals that seem designed to avoid tripping antitrust wires.

Behind the scenes: Most Groq shareholders will receive per-share distributions tied to the $20 billion valuation, according to sources.

Around 85% will be paid up-front, while another 10% is paid midyear 2026 and the remainder at the end of 2026.

Around 90% of Groq employees are said to be joining Nvidia, and they will be paid cash for all vested shares. Their unvested shares will be paid out at the $20 billion valuation, but via Nvidia stock that vests on a schedule.

There are also around 50 members of that group whose entire stock packages are being accelerated and paid out in cash.

Remaining Groq employees will also be paid for vested shares, plus will receive a package that includes economic participation in the ongoing company.

Any Groq employee — staying or leaving — with the company for less than one year will have their vesting cliff dropped, so they can get some up-front liquidity.

By the numbers: Groq had raised around $3.3 billion in venture capital funding since its 2016 founding, including a $750 million infusion this past fall at nearly a $7 billion post-money valuation.

Backers include Social Capital, BlackRock, Neuberger Berman, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners, Samsung, 1789 Capital, Cisco, D1, Cleo Capital, Altimeter, Firestreak Ventures, Conversion Capital and Modi Venture.
