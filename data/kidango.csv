Despite policy recognition, implementation remains uneven due to limited teacher preparedness, underdeveloped policy mechanisms, and inadequate resources. This study proposes and empirically tests a conceptual framework to assess Pakistan’s readiness for STEM education by examining the role of teacher preparedness, policy support, funding, and resource availability. Grounded in educational change and capacity-building theories, the study develops five hypotheses based on these factors. A quantitative survey method was employed, gathering data from 600 participants, including 500 teachers, 50 school principals, and 50 administrators across 30 secondary schools in Multan, Punjab. Data was analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0, with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) validating the measurement model. Key findings show that funding significantly enhances resource availability, supporting STEM implementation. Policy support and technology access are also critical drivers of success. The study confirms the reliability and validity of the measurement constructs, showing strong factor loadings and high Cronbach’s Alpha and Composite Reliability coefficients. Implications highlight the urgent need for financial and policy support to establish Pakistan’s robust STEM education system. These findings underscore the importance of policy reforms and increased funding to bridge the gaps in STEM education. Future research should engage policymakers and government bodies to co-develop targeted strategies that bridge the gap between policy and practice.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-025-05584-3/MediaObjects/41599_2025_5584_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2025-07-30 17:57:10.584321

These subcultures are often embedded in neo-liberal dehumanising discourses, practices and cultural artefacts that proliferate in the marketised HE sector, as well as pedagogies centred on institutionalised hierarchies and highly particular notions of ‘valued knowledge’, born themselves of hierarchical cultures. This paper focuses on the aim of humanising assessment through interdisciplinary HE. It explores how this pedagogical approach can redefine the (student) research culture in HE and foster opportunities for interdisciplinary student research within the curriculum. Practical approaches that integrate such cultural critical scrutiny of modernity into interdisciplinary assessment are missing from the literature. Such critical pedagogy calls for the development of social and emotional literacy and intelligence and these competencies need to be reflected in the development of approaches to assessment that are academically rigorous. We see the ‘Student-Devised Assessment’ (SDA) as an effective, humanising form of interdisciplinary assessment which challenges, stretches, and redefines the notion of ‘research’ in HE, and which can be evaluated reliably and even systematically, ensuring academic rigour and quality. The SDA is an ideal assignment to develop core interdisciplinary skills, such as coping with uncertainty, while enhancing student-centred learning and academic ownership. Furthermore, it is effective in promoting the ethical use of AI-generative tools in assessment across disciplines, and allows students to contribute to knowledge in exciting and creative ways.",,,,,2025-07-29 00:05:36.135869
