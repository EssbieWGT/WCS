Despite policy recognition, implementation remains uneven due to limited teacher preparedness, underdeveloped policy mechanisms, and inadequate resources. This study proposes and empirically tests a conceptual framework to assess Pakistan’s readiness for STEM education by examining the role of teacher preparedness, policy support, funding, and resource availability. Grounded in educational change and capacity-building theories, the study develops five hypotheses based on these factors. A quantitative survey method was employed, gathering data from 600 participants, including 500 teachers, 50 school principals, and 50 administrators across 30 secondary schools in Multan, Punjab. Data was analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0, with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) validating the measurement model. Key findings show that funding significantly enhances resource availability, supporting STEM implementation. Policy support and technology access are also critical drivers of success. The study confirms the reliability and validity of the measurement constructs, showing strong factor loadings and high Cronbach’s Alpha and Composite Reliability coefficients. Implications highlight the urgent need for financial and policy support to establish Pakistan’s robust STEM education system. These findings underscore the importance of policy reforms and increased funding to bridge the gaps in STEM education. Future research should engage policymakers and government bodies to co-develop targeted strategies that bridge the gap between policy and practice.",,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1057%2Fs41599-025-05584-3/MediaObjects/41599_2025_5584_Fig1_HTML.png,,,2025-07-30 17:57:10.584321
