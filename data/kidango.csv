However, limited data exists on the impact of subclinical EAEC infections, particularly when co-detected with other pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate socioeconomic risk factors and the effects of subclinical EAEC infection - alone or in combination with other pathogens - on intestinal barrier function, enteric inflammation, linear growth, and cognitive development in children aged 0-24 months, using quantitative molecular diagnostics. Methods: We analyzed 1,618 non-diarrheal samples from children enrolled in eight sites of the MAL-ED birth cohort. A quantitative PCR-based TaqMan Array Card was used to detect 29 enteropathogens. Children were categorized by infection status: EAEC alone, or EAEC with one, two, or three or more co-pathogens. Associations with socioeconomic indicators (e.g., maternal education, household income, sanitation), clinical symptoms, use of medication, anthropometry, biomarkers (myeloperoxidase [MPO], neopterin [NEO], alpha-1-antitrypsin, lactulose:mannitol ratio), nutritional z-scores, and Bayley developmental scores were assessed. Results: Lower socioeconomic and sanitation scores, as well as lower WAMI index values, were significantly associated with EAEC infection and increased pathogen burden (p < 0.001). Children with subclinical EAEC infection and high pathogen loads also had a higher frequency of antibiotic use. Subclinical EAEC infection - either alone or with >= 3 co-pathogens - was associated with elevated fecal neopterin (beta = 687.5; 95% CI: 129.7 to 1245.3), increased intestinal permeability (% lactulose Z-score, beta = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.058 to 0.77), lower linear growth (LAZ, beta = -0.44; 95% CI: -0.76 to -0.12), and reduced cognitive scores at 15 and 24 months (beta = -2.82; 95% CI: -5.15 to -0.48; beta = -5.02; 95% CI: -9.81 to -0.22, respectively). Conclusion: Quantitative molecular diagnostics revealed that subclinical EAEC infections with high pathogen burden are associated with adverse socioeconomic conditions, frequent antibiotic use, intestinal inflammation, increased permeability, impaired linear growth, and poorer cognitive development. Even isolated EAEC infection was linked to cognitive deficits, underscoring its potential role in the pathogenesis of environmental enteropathy and early childhood developmental delays.
