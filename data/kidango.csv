Born on January 7, 1934, in St. Michel, France, Jeanne spent her early years in her hometown, completing her general education during her teenage years. On February 12, 1958, she married Jean Tristant in St. Michel. Together with their oldest daughter, they immigrated to the United States settling in Pomona, California in 1962. They settled in&nbsp;Turlock, California&nbsp;in 1964 and later made their home in the Stevinson and Hilmar area beginning in 1969.

Jeanne was a devoted housewife and worked alongside her husband operating their dairy from 1964 until 1990. She took great pride in raising their five children and creating a warm and loving home. Jeanne enjoyed sewing, gardening, walking, spending time with her grandchildren, and attending mass. Her faith was central to her life, and she was an active member of Holy Rosary Catholic Church. She also participated in the Los Banos Basque Club, reflecting her cultural heritage.

She was preceded in death by her beloved husband, Jean Tristant; her parents, Pierre and Catherine Aldacourrou; and her siblings, Gracie Esponde, Soeur Catherine Pierre Aldacourrou, and Bernard Aldacourrou.

Jeanne is survived by her children, Marguerite Marie (Charlie) Germann, Gracie (Jim) Northern, Jean Louis Tristant, Yvonne (Ronnie) Vieira, and Michel Tristant; grandchildren Jared and Daniel Germann; siblings Marcelle Marquine and Auguste (Josette) Aldacourrou of France; as well as numerous nieces, nephews, and their families.

A Rosary and Memorial Mass will be held on Monday, July 21, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. at Holy Rosary Catholic Church, 8471 Cypress St., Hilmar, CA.

In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Holy Rosary Catholic Church or Artzai Ona, P.O. Box 6439, Boise, ID 83707.
