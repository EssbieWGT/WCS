Running back Terrell Jennings has been ruled out for the AFC East rematch due to a concussion, as head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed during his final press conference of the week. And on the other side of the ball in Foxborough, defensive captain Robert Spillane moves forward as the team’s lone questionable.

Here’s the rest of the game statuses leading up to Sunday’s 1 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.

OUT

Patriots

RB Terrell Jennings (concussion)

Bills

No players listed

Jennings remained a non-participant through three consecutive injury reports before officially being ruled out. The 2024 undrafted arrival out of Florida A&M entered the NFL’s concussion protocol against the New York Giants as the calendar turned to December. The running back depth chart will now be subject to movement behind starter Rhamondre Stevenson and reigning AFC Offensive Rookie of the Month TreVeyon Henderson. Veteran D’Ernest Johnson, a three-time standard elevation from the practice squad, is on track to join the 53-man roster. That will require a corresponding move by 4 p.m. ET on Saturday.

“Yeah, D’Ernest will probably get to the game and help us,” New England’s head coach said. “We’ll have to figure some things out now, this afternoon or tomorrow, with the roster.”

QUESTIONABLE

Patriots

LB Robert Spillane (foot)

Bills

WR Joshua Palmer (ankle)

LB Terrel Bernard (elbow)

CB Christian Benford (toe)

The Patriots added Spillane to the injury report as a limited participant on Thursday due to a foot injury. A questionable tag followed on Friday. The off-ball linebacker had seen his workload scale back to a season-low 38 defensive downs during his latest start. He ranks atop the unit with 97 tackles while also having a hand in one sack, one forced fumble, five passes defensed and two interceptions returned for 70 yards. Only cornerback Carlton Davis III and safety Craig Woodson have logged a higher rate of snaps for New England’s defense than his 95.36 percent.

But guard Jared Wilson, nose tackle Khyiris Tonga and special teams captain Brenden Schooler are set to go without game designations after landing among the inactives prior to the bye week. The same prognosis holds for swing tackle Vederian Lowe, defensive tackle Christian Barmore as well as outside linebacker and sack leader Harold Landry III.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/12/gettyimages-2244892951.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C2.1001449919722%2C100%2C78.538867550777&w=1200,N,,2025-12-12 18:02:18.030846

Johnson played 61.1% of the defensive snaps Nov. 28 against the Eagles and 66.0% last Sunday in Green Bay.
Pro Bowl right guard Wyatt Teller (calf) and right tackle Jack Conklin (concussion) have been ruled out of Sunday's game.","Stevenson revealed that watching last Sunday's game at home was ""very weird.""

""I'm calling out plays, I'm yelling,"" he said. ""I woke my son up a couple times. I got in trouble for that. It definitely felt weird just not to be there with the guys and go out and feel that energy, feel that motivation playing the Green Bay Packers.""

Fellow cornerback Jaylon Johnson also was not given an injury designation after practicing in full all week. The two-time Pro Bowler will play in his third straight game after missing nine contests with a groin injury. Johnson played 61.1% of the defensive snaps Nov. 28 against the Eagles and 66.0% last Sunday in Green Bay.

""He's getting closer and closer [to full strength] each and every week,"" said defensive coordinator Dennis Allen. ""When you think about a guy that really hadn't played a lot of football basically in about a year, it takes a little bit of time to get back to where you need to be. He's working extremely hard to do that.""

While Stevenson and Johnson will be on the field together for the first time since the season opener, nickel back Kyler Gordon has been ruled out of Sunday's game with a groin injury that he sustained during pre-game warm-ups in Green Bay.

In other injury news, running back Travis Homer will sit out Sunday with an ankle injury and receiver Rome Odunze is questionable with a foot injury that limited him all week in practice and forced him to miss the Packers game.

The Browns, meanwhile, will face the Bears without three and possibly four of their five starting offensive linemen.

Center Ethan Pocic was lost for the season with a torn Achilles tendon last weekend against the Titans. Pro Bowl right guard Wyatt Teller (calf) and right tackle Jack Conklin (concussion) have been ruled out of Sunday's game.

An earlier concussion suffered in Week 12 prevented Higgins from appearing in the Bengals' first meeting with the Ravens in Week 13, a 32-14 win over Baltimore on Thanksgiving, before Higgins returned to lead Cincinnati in receiving and score two touchdowns in Week 14.

While the Bengals were just fine without Higgins in the surprising triumph over the Ravens on Thanksgiving night, they can't guarantee the same will be true in Week 15. Higgins has proven to be an essential piece in the Bengals' passing offense, especially when Joe Burrow is behind center and distributing the football among a receiving corps that includes Ja'Marr Chase, Andrei Iosivas, Mitchell Tinsley and tight ends Mike Gesicki and Noah Fant.

In the three games Higgins has played with Burrow this season, he's led the Bengals in receiving twice.

Njoku was injured while catching a touchdown pass last week but has fallen behind Harold Fannin Jr. in snaps. Sampson's absence will mean a larger role for Jerome Ford. Teller's absence and Bitonio's potential absence could hurt the Browns up front against a poor Bears defense. Ward is a key piece in the secondary and will be missed. Tillman hasn't been as large a part of the offense recently as he was early in the season but is still a valuable part of the receiver rotation.

Gordon has played in only three games this year and missed last week against Green Bay. Odunze was limited in practice throughout the week after also missing last week's game against the Packers.

Bateman was a late-week addition and then downgraded to DNP on Friday, which is usually not a good sign. Washington practiced fully all week could be be gearing up to return from his extended stay on injured reserve.

Higgins will miss his second game in the last three weeks due to a concussion. Trey Hendrickson was placed on IR and is out for the year, so missing Stewart as well would be a blow to Cincinnati up front.

Harrison is out for the second week in a row and fourth time in the last five games. The Cards are beset by injuries in the secondary and potentially along the defensive line. If Demercado misses again, they'll also remain shorthanded in the backfield after they did not activate Trey Benson from injured reserve earlier this week.

If Chubb can't go, Woody Marks will again carry the load for the Texans. Bryant and Watson fully practiced on Friday while Speed was limited.

Brady Cook will start for New York with both Fields and Tyrod Taylor out. The tight end room could be depleted if Smartt joins Taylor on the sideline.

Both Washington and Little got in full practices on Friday, a good sign for their potential availability.

Davis is a valuable returner for the Chargers. Molden's potential absence could hurt on the back end while Pipkins' could force the Chargers deeper into their tackle depth. Johnston did not practice on Friday after being a full participant all week prior to that.

The Chiefs have had issues getting open in recent weeks, and the absence of Brown won't help their offense get back on track. Kansas City is again incredibly banged up along the offensive line. And McDuffie's potential absence would be huge if he can't go. He was limited after suffering a knee injury during last week's game.

Benford was downgraded from limited on Thursday to DNP on Friday, which is usually not a good sign for player availability. Both Bernard and Palmer were limited throughout the week.

Jennings' absence will leave the backfield work to TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson. If Spillane can't go, that could hurt against a Bills offense that loves to run the ball and use multi-tight end sets to hit defenses with play-action passes.

Daniels is not yet cleared for contact after aggravating his elbow injury last week. The Commies could be even more shorthanded if Rodriguez and/or Samuel can't play. Rodriguez was limited throughout the week and Samuel did not practice on Friday.

The Giants have all kinds of issues up front on defense, which could be exacerbated if Lawrence, in particular, can't play. Lawrence was a late-week addition to the report, which is usually not a good sign. They could also be shorthanded in the special teams department without their punter and possible their primary return specialist.

Kenny Pickett will start in place of Geno Smith. He'll have a depleted offensive line in front of him and could potentially be without the team's best blocking tight end as well.

Neither Carter nor Johnson practiced at all this week. They are massive losses on their respective sides of the ball.

Jacobs got in a limited practice on Friday after not practicing earlier in the week. If he's out, Emanuel Wilson and Chris Brooks will carry the load. Van Ness was limited throughout the week.

Denver could be shorthanded up front against the ferocious Green Bay pass rush. McGlinchey was a late-week add and didn't practice on Friday. Bryant's absence will thrust Troy Franklin and potential Lil'Jordan Humphrey into larger roles as outside receivers.

Detroit has a number of injuries in the secondary, specifically at safety, which could be a big liability against the Rams. The injuries along the offensive line could be damaging as well, against L.A.'s strong defensive front. All of their questionable players save for Decker, who didn't practice, were limited throughout the week of practices.

The Colts are very shorthanded on defense with their two best players out for this game. They'll also be without their right tackle in front of either Philip Rivers or Riley Leonard, whomever makes the start under center.

If Seattle is without both Arroyo and Saubert, that could hamper its ability to use favored multi-tight end sets. Sundell has been out since early November but got in full sessions late this week, a potential good sign for his return.

The Lions’ starting safeties have incurred a couple of brutal blows this week, both of which will likely jeopardize their seasons.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

Ruled OUT

S Kerby Joseph (knee)

S Brian Branch (Achilles)

Joseph has apparently suffered a setback with his knee, according to coach Dan Campbell, and is now a candidate for IR. Landing in IR at this time of year would effectively end a season of frustration, where he’s continuously fought to get his knee rehabilitated.

“Kerby had a setback, so obviously, not as – don’t feel as good about that,” Campbell said on Friday

Branch being ruled out is a formality, as he has already had successful Achilles surgery and is expected to be placed on IR on Saturday.

Questionable

RB Sione Vaki (thumb)

WR Kalif Raymond (ankle)

TE Shane Zylstra (knee, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 9

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

LG Kayode Awosika (foot)

LG Christian Mahogany (fibula, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 18

S Thomas Harper (concussion)

Vaki has been able to play through his thumb injury for a few weeks now and is expected to play this weekend, despite the questionable designation.

Raymond has been trending toward returning this week, and he should have a chance to be active on Sunday. If able to play, he should reassume his punt returner role and will contribute as a WR3 or WR4 option on offense.

Zylstra remains on injured reserve for the moment, but a questionable designation suggests there’s a chance he is removed from IR—likely this Saturday before the team travels to LA—and re-added to the 53-man roster. He’ll have a chance to step into a TE1 or TE2 upon his return to action.

Decker missed all three practices this week, which is mildly concerning, but this is something the veteran offensive lineman has done previously this year, so there’s still a realistic chance he can suit up on Sunday. It’s notable that “rest” was added to his injury report on Friday. If he’s not able to play, Dan Skipper would most likely step into the starting left tackle role, and his sixth OL role would be passed along to another reserve offensive lineman.

Mahogany has participated in three practices since his injury evaluation clock has started, and while it seems unlikely he’ll be activated from IR this week, the Lions have left the door open. Mahogany has said he doesn’t anticipate being in this recovery window for long, but it’ll likely be at least another week before he gets another shot to return to the active roster.

Awosika missed last week’s game but has been able to practice all week and will have a chance to start at left guard in this game. If the Lions feel like he’s not quite ready to return to that role, Detroit would then turn to Trystan Colon. Regardless of which player starts, there’s a good chance rookie Miles Frazier will cut into some of their reps as the Lions seem determined to get him more experience.

Harper has practiced all week, but Campbell wouldn’t go as far as to say that he’s cleared the NFL’s concussion protocols just yet.

“Harper will be out there at practice today, so feel pretty good about him, but we’ll see,” Campbell explained on Friday. “There again, I can’t give you a definitive right now, but that’s kind of where we’re at. So, we’ll be good.

If Harper is unable to clear on time—and with Joseph and Branch unavailable—the Lions will likely turn to Avonte Maddox and either Daniel Thomas or practice squad safety Erick Hallett.

“Look, Hallett’s been taking reps, (Thomas’) DT’s been taking reps, Maddox has been taking reps,” Campbell said Friday. “We’ve got plenty of guys. They’re getting valuable reps, so we’re good.”

The Lions also claimed Jalen Mills off waivers and signed Damontae Kazee to their practice squad this week, but the chances are neither will be up to speed enough to challenge for a heavy contributing role this weekend.

Not listed with an injury designation

LB Alex Anzalone (illness)

Anzalone missed practice on Wednesday with an illness, but he was able to return to practice on Thursday and looks ready to play against the Rams on Sunday.

Buffalo’s top cornerback, Christian Benford, was on the injury report on Thursday due to a toe injury he suffered in practice. On Friday, Bills’ head coach Sean McDermott gave an update on Benford and admitted he wasn’t sure if he would be able to play on Sunday.

“We really don’t know,” McDermott said on Friday. “Just 24 hours off of the incident, so we will see how today goes.”

He won't carry an injury designation into Sunday's game, so hopefully that signals the bye week did Landry some good.","New England is preparing for a huge divisional showdown with the Buffalo Bills at Gillette Stadium on Sunday, where a win would clinch the AFC East for the Patriots.

After having a late bye in Week 14, the good news is that the Patriots roster is getting healthier for the stretch run and arguably the biggest home game in nearly four years. On Friday, the Patriots listed only two players with game statuses: RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) was ruled out, and LB Robert Spillane (foot) is officially questionable. Buffalo listed CB Christian Benford (toe), LB Terrell Bernard (elbow), and WR Joshua Palmer (ankle) as questionable. DE Joey Bosa (hamstring/wrist) and RT Spencer Brown (shoulder) will play for the Bills on Sunday.

Starting on offense, the bye week did some good for starting LG Jared Wilson, who missed a Week 13 win over the Giants due to an ankle injury. Wilson injured his ankle early in the first quarter of the Patriots victory in Cincinnati in Week 12, playing just three snaps vs. the Bengals, and then sat out the game against New York heading into the bye. The third-round rookie has started 11 games at left guard in his first season, flashing his high-end athleticism on the move in the run game, and was starting to find a groove in pass protection. In his last two full games prior to the injury, Wilson had allowed just one total pressure vs. the Bucs and Jets.

Based on media access at Patriots practice, it seems as though Wilson will be reinserted into the starting lineup on Sunday after participating fully in all three sessions this week. With the rookie guard expected back in the starting lineup, the Patriots could start their fourth different offensive line combination through 14 games: LT Vederian Lowe, LG Jared Wilson, C Garrett Bradbury, RG Mike Onwenu, and RT Morgan Moses. Although injuries to their rookie starters on the left side have led to some shuffling, New England started 11 different line combinations during the 2024 season, so they've still had great continuity on the O-Line, comparatively speaking.

The other injury-related topic worth discussing offensively is who will serve as the Patriots third running back this week. With Jennings (concussion) ruled out, New England only has two healthy backs on the active roster, Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. On the practice squad, RB D'Ernest Johnson has already hit the maximum of three standard elevations, but head coach Mike Vrabel said Johnson will be moved to the active roster. The Patriots will need to make room on the 53-man roster for Johnson, with that move likely coming on Saturday.

Moving over to the other side of the ball, the positive injury update for the Patriots defense is that NT Khyiris Tonga is trending toward a return. Tonga also sat out the Giants game after suffering a chest injury Week 12 in Cincinnati. This week, the big nose tackle was a full participant in practice, while telling reporters that he ""feels good"" coming off some extra rest. Tonga is a huge part of New England's run defense and plays a small role on offense as a lead-blocker in short-yardage situations, which could help the Patriots slumping red zone offense.​

New England's run defense has been very stingy with Tonga, allowing -0.10 expected points added with its 335-pound nose tackle on the field. When he hasn't been available, the Patriots run defense is allowing an even 0.0 EPA per rush – a +0.10 EPA difference in favor of the offense, which is substantial. The Bills enter the week ranked seventh in rush EPA, led by star RB James Cook, who in many ways has become the engine of Buffalo's offense. Although most start with slowing down MVP quarterback Josh Allen, limiting Cook is arguably just as important.

Before the bye week, the Patriots run defense was slumping, ranking last in rushing success rate allowed in their previous four games (53.3%). Tonga's return and the rest of New England's defensive front getting some much-needed rest during the bye week will hopefully see the run defense return to form. In the first nine weeks, the Patriots ranked fifth in rushing success rate allowed (36.2%), so it's possible that the slump was just injury and lack-of-rest-related.

As for Spillane, the Patriots captain is dealing with a foot injury that led to him being a limited participant in the last two practices. Spillane only played 69.1% of the defensive snaps, a smaller workload than usual, in New England's last game before its bye week vs. the Giants. If he's limited again this week, the Pats leaned more on Jack Gibbens alongside Christian Elliss at linebacker.

Lastly, captain Harold Landry III continues to manage a lingering knee injury stemming from an injury scare during New England's Week 6 win against the Saints. Landry returned to Friday's practice after being limited on Wednesday and a non-participant on Thursday. He won't carry an injury designation into Sunday's game, so hopefully that signals the bye week did Landry some good. The Patriots have relied on undrafted rookie Elijah Ponder and vet Anfernee Jennings as depth on the edge.

By starting the season 11-2, the Patriots have played their way into an incredible opportunity to clinch the AFC East with a win over the Bills on Sunday. Buffalo has won the division for five consecutive seasons, dating back to 2020, but New England has a very simple playoff clinching scenario this week: win, and you're division champs. To claim the AFC East title on their own terms would be a massive accomplishment for head coach Mike Vrabel and company.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/ymquxjobw6gonahltpkn,N,,2025-12-12 17:05:07.713603

Watt has been ruled out for Monday night's game against the Miami Dolphins.

Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said he spoke with Watt on Wednesday evening, and said the pass rusher was ""comfortable."" Tomlin added that Watt was not dealing with an injury coming out of Week 14's game and that was he was unaware when or how Watt's symptoms started.

Watt, 31, has appeared in all 13 of the Steelers' games this season. He's registered 53 tackles and seven sacks in those contests.

While Watt has battled injuries in the past, he's been relatively healthy the past couple seasons. Prior to 2025, Watt played in 17 games in back-to-back years. He made the Pro Bowl in both seasons, earning a first team All-Pro nod in 2023 after leading the league with 19 sacks.

In July, the Steelers gave Watt a three-year, $123 million extension. The contract made Watt the highest paid non-quarterback in NFL history. That record has since been passed by Detroit Lions pass rusher Aidan Hutchinson.

Watt's absence at team facilities comes at a difficult time. At 7-6, the Steelers lead the AFC North, but their grasp on that spot is tenuous at best. The 6-7 Baltimore Ravens sit just behind Pittsburgh in the division. If Watt misses time, the Steelers would need to find a way to hold onto their lead in the AFC North without arguably their best player.

“We didn’t come out and dictate how to play the game,” Leafs coach Craig Berube said of his team’s poor third period, which he pointed to as the reason for the loss. “We turned pucks over, we were passive, we didn’t finish them off.”

After taking a 2-1 lead on the strength of goals from Dakota Joshua and Auston Matthews and the continued strong play of Dennis Hildeby, losing Oliver Ekman-Larsson to injury seemed to derail the Leafs. They looked sloppy in multiple shifts later in the third period, and some of their best players didn’t look at their best in overtime. The Sharks ultimately capitalized, coming back to take a 3-2 win in the extra frame.

“I still think we’re not where we need to be. We can be better. The third period showed that,” Berube said.

The Leafs managed a point, sure, but should they end up missing the playoffs by a thin margin, this loss feels like one they will look back on and regret.

Here’s more of what we saw:

Ekman-Larsson’s injury could be potentially catastrophic

Ekman-Larsson seemed to know right away that he was in serious trouble.

After colliding with Sharks forward Adam Gaudette in the third period, Ekman-Larsson’s left leg appeared to twist under the weight of a falling Gaudette. It looked like a freak play that happens often in NHL games, but the outcome here was much different and potentially, for the Leafs, much worse.

Ekman-Larsson could not get up and off the ice on his own. He required the help of teammates Calle Järnkrok and Morgan Rielly. Ekman-Larsson could not put any weight on his left leg. Once the Leafs defenceman left the ice, he continued to struggle to walk, using his stick to help himself to the dressing room.

“He’s got to be re-evaluated tomorrow,” Berube said of Ekman-Larsson. “I don’t know exactly the length of it.“

However, it was the look of resignation on Ekman-Larsson’s face that told the whole story: This did not look like the kind of injury that any player could recover from quickly enough.

“He’ll be missed,” Berube said, which didn’t sound promising. “Hopefully it’s not too bad.”

First, on Ekman-Larsson: If he’s out long-term, what a genuine shame. He’s in the middle of a great season and has been the Leafs’ best defenceman most nights. He has even been garnering some low-key attention for Sweden’s Olympic team, though he told me on Wednesday he wasn’t thinking about that whatsoever.

Next, on the Leafs defence: Man oh man, if you think the Leafs might be cursed, you are probably pointing to the injuries on their blue line right now. The timeline for both Chris Tanev and Brandon Carlo to return from their respective injuries is unclear.

Berube did say, after being asked by a reporter, whether Carlo had recently undergone surgery. Berube confirmed he did and that Carlo is expected to miss “about” a month because of it. What exactly Carlo had surgery on remains unclear.

Dakota Mermis is also out with a knee injury. Henry Thrun was called up from the Marlies to play his first game for the Leafs this season, and looked like he could have a job in the NHL.

Losing Ekman-Larsson could be potentially catastrophic for the blue line. The Leafs don’t have another puck-mover with his power-play capabilities and experience.

Marshall Rifai is practicing in a red no-contact jersey after a wrist injury requiring surgery in training camp. He could potentially be an option to hop on the back end, though when exactly that could happen is unclear. William Villeneuve is having another strong season for the Marlies and deserves his first NHL call-up, but he’s currently unavailable due to illness. The Marlies hope to know more about his return next week.

Look to the Leafs to likely call up Matt Benning, a right-shot defenceman who was an NHL regular as recently as 2022-23.

If Ekman-Larsson’s injury is serious, the Leafs would be down to three of their preferred top six defencemen for the foreseeable future. For a team that struggled to defend well early this season, they now have an even taller mountain to climb.

The power play is alive!

Cue my Colin Clive impersonation as Dr. Frankenstein: “The power play! It’s alive!”

Through two first-period power plays, the woeful Maple Leafs power play awoke with some of the most dynamic and purposeful puck movement we’ve seen this season.

Quick, quick, quick — that’s how the Leafs looked on the power play.

Is it just that simple? Throw the puck around with purpose and some aggression and good things will happen? Surely not, but something sparked the Leafs; they did not look like a team with a league-worst power play. Matthews scored the Leafs’ first power-play goal in five games thanks to a gnarly cross-ice pass from William Nylander.

“They moved it and shot it, moved it and shot it,” Berube said. “Things opened up.”

At the very least, the energy from all three of the Leafs’ power plays offered something to build off of. The Leafs didn’t score on their first power play, but they did land four shots, most of which were dangerous.

It needs to be said, though: The Sharks’ defensive positioning ahead of Matthews’ goal was ridiculously poor. The four players who left Matthews with that much time and space with their heads turned elsewhere are going to have that play clipped and shown multiple times in video sessions, and it won’t be pretty.

Joshua is coming into his own

After a rough start to the season, in which Joshua himself called out his own game, the offseason acquisition is starting to come into his own. His efforts against the Sharks stood out: Joshua was relentless in pursuing pucks, hounded the opposition with his size and got in the right spots to create offensive chances.

Was his game-opening goal a Mona Lisa? Hardly: Joshua got in front of Sharks defenceman Timothy Liljegren (and likely triggered some Liljegren haters in the process) and got a stick on a Jake McCabe shot. The puck bounced off Joshua’s stick and then off Liljegren and into the Sharks’ net.

Berube demands effort down low, in the ugly areas of the ice. There was more fearlessness from Joshua in his 15:03 TOI on Thursday than he’d shown in October and November. He has now scored three goals in his last six games.

Yes, some of his pop tonight was a byproduct of playing with Nylander — one of the best offensive players in the league — but Joshua looks to be finding his groove. From the outside, he appears to be playing with a level of comfort and confidence he struggled to attain in his transition to Toronto. It was on display against San Jose.

His third-period interference penalty wasn’t a great one to take. Still, an effective and forceful Joshua could continue to give the Leafs the bottom-six punch they need, even when Bobby McMann (serving a one-game suspension) returns to that line on Saturday.

Hildeby’s positioning is the best part of his game

The Leafs’ new No. 1 goalie put forth another stellar performance, including stopping a Ty Dellandrea penalty shot in the first period. It was how Hildeby stopped the shot, and 29 of the 32 he faced, that stood out: He rarely looked out of position. He’s using his 6-foot-7 frame to his advantage in a way he didn’t last season. He barely had to move to get a glove on Dellandrea’s shot; he read the shot the whole way. And when he did have to move side to side, there was an economy within Hildeby’s movements.

Hildeby can’t really be faulted for any of the Leafs’ three goals against. While Joseph Woll is trending toward being available this weekend after a recent injury, it feels like Berube and company should ride Hildeby’s hot hand against the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday.

Nylander and Nick Robertson respond to changes

McMann’s suspension led to movement in the Leafs forward group: Nylander was shuffled down to the third line because of a recent (minor) dip in his play, and Nick Robertson, after a recent healthy scratch, was placed back in the lineup.

Both players responded as Berube hoped they would.

Robertson was all over the ice, hounding pucks and setting up teammates with creative puck movement. Robertson was tied for second among all Leafs with three shots on goal, and at five-on-five, led all Leafs with three scoring chances, per Natural Stat Trick.

And Nylander?

“The best game I’ve seen him play in a while,” Berube said. “He was engaged. When I see him skating and handling the puck and keeping the puck and doing the things he did tonight with the puck, I know he was ready to go.”

Nylander logged two assists in 21:57 of ice time, his highest TOI in over a month. His stint on the third line is undoubtedly over, but it will be remembered fondly.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/11234855/GettyImages-2251272993-scaled-e1765514986369.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-12 16:02:42.454203

The Colts quarterback saw his season of redemption end in heartbreaking fashion when he tore his Achilles during Sunday’s loss to the Jaguars.

Jones wrote a heartfelt message to those connected to the organization after leading them to an 8-5 start.

“Thank you to my teammates, coaches, the Colts organization, and all the fans for the overwhelming support,” Jones wrote on Instagram, along with a series of photos from the season.

“Tough way to end this season but it has been an honor to wear the horseshoe and play for Colts fans. I’ll miss lining up with my guys, but I’ll be riding with them every step of the way. Go Colts!”

The question now becomes whether Jones has taken his last snap for the franchise — unless you think 44-year-old Philip Rivers is their quarterback of the future.

After a sad end to his Giants stint and a brief run as a Vikings practice squad player, Jones signed a one-year, $14 million contract with the Colts last offseason.

He won the starting job over Anthony Richardson and impressed — 3,109 passing yards and 19 touchdowns — under QB-friendly head coach Shane Steichen.

Jones, 28, had been setting himself up for a massive free agency payday with the Colts or another team.

However, his injury — which approximately has a nine-month recovery timeline — complicates things as it’s unclear if he will be ready for the start of next season.

Jones also has the baggage of a disastrous end to his Giants tenure, which saw him demoted to fourth-string before eventually being released at his own request last season.

The Colts pulled Rivers out of retirement as a Band-Aid as they try to resuscitate their once hopeful season.

Richardson is sidelined with a fractured orbital bone suffered in a freak pregame incident, but doubts about his future with the franchise goes beyond the injury.

The No. 4 pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, has been plagued by spotty play and losing out on the job to Jones was a glaring indictment on how he is viewed.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/daniel-jones-17-indianapolis-colts-116940447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-12-12 15:01:52.640282

Lamb returned to practice as a full participant on Thursday as his recovery has gone well enough for him to return for Sunday Night Football.

""Process has been cool. Obviously, it's been a lot of eye work and eye discipline and trying to, I guess, frustrate myself essentially to see if I have any more residuals of the concussion. And I haven't had any type of symptoms,"" Lamb said. ""As for me now, it's been heavy on rest, to be honest. Doing everything, me knowing my requirements, kind of getting ahead of everything, especially with the extra 2-3 days that we had off. I feel like that was big.""

Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt had successful surgery to ""stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung,"" according to his brother J.J.

Watt was in a dry needling treatment session at the team's practice facility on Wednesday when he started to feel discomfort. There is no timeline for a recovery, but he will be released from the hospital on Friday, according to J.J. Watt.

Other notable Week 15 injuries:

Cincinnati Bengals receiver Tee Higgins has been ruled out for Sunday's matchup with the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion. Higgins missed Week 13 with a concussion and found himself back in protocol this week after getting injured last week against the Buffalo Bills. Higgins was evaluated in-game and cleared to return, but Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said Monday that the receiver was back in protocol. He was limited during Thursday's practice and ultimately ruled out Friday afternoon.

The Washington Commanders have already ruled quarterback Jayden Daniels out for Week 15 due to aggravating an elbow injury in Week 14's loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Daniels had just returned from a three-game absence after dislocating that elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. Marcus Mariota will start his seventh game this season when the Commanders face the New York Giants on Sunday.

Trey Benson will not return this season after the Arizona Cardinals chose not to activate him from injured reserve during his 21-day practice window. The running back has been out since Week 4 with a knee injury. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Benson had not progressed enough to warrant a return this season.

Injuries to his right shoulder and back will likely sideline Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Geno Smith for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Kenny Pickett has been taking first-team reps this week as head coach Pete Carroll called Smith ""day-to-day.""

Higgins was evaluated in-game and cleared to return, but Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said Monday that the receiver was back in protocol. He was limited during Thursday's practice, putting his availability for Sunday's matchup against the Baltimore Ravens in doubt.

Johnson didn't practice on Dec. 11, so it's more than likely that he won't play against the Raiders on Dec. 14 with just one more day in the practice week.

But Johnson wasn't the only offensive lineman sitting out. Left guard Landon Dickerson also missed practice because of a calf injury/rest designation, and Lane Johnson's replacement, Fred Johnson, was listed as limited with an ankle injury.

Defensive tackle Jalen Carter also sat out practice. He's expected to miss his second straight game after having a non-surgical procedure on both of his shoulders.

Dickerson left the game in the first half against the Chargers on Dec. 8 with a calf injury, but returned in the fourth quarter.

Dickerson was listed as ""limited"" on Dec. 10, but that was an estimation based on a walkthrough practice. The Eagles had a full practice on Dec. 11. Fred Johnson was not listed on the injury report on Dec. 10, meaning that he likely suffered his injury during practice.

If both Lane and Fred Johnson can't play against the Raiders, Matt Pryor would be the likely replacement.

Fred Johnson has replaced Lane Johnson for the past three games, all losses. Brett Toth went in for Dickerson against the Chargers.

It's likely that the Eagles didn't put Lane Johnson on IR, requiring him to miss four games, when he first suffered the injury because it was determined that surgery wasn't required. That would have ended his season.

Instead, the Eagles took a chance that Lane Johnson could return before the four games were up. And really, Johnson, a perennial Pro Bowl player, were never going to fill his roster spot with a suitable replacement.

But obviously the fact that you are missing players, (means) you are loading other players more (as) a consequence.","At the start of December, Mikel Arteta said injuries had been “a theme of this season” for his Arsenal side.

After 15 league games, Arsenal have suffered that very same number of injuries, but as they are currently top of both the Premier League and Champions League tables, their lengthy list of absentees has largely been a subplot to the campaign so far.

November was a particularly bleak one in injury terms with up to seven players out at one point, and six of those being midfielders and attackers: Viktor Gyokeres, Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli, Noni Madueke and Martin Odegaard. In recent weeks, all bar Havertz have returned, with each comeback being managed differently.

It might seem players hit the ground running after a period out of action, like Jesus seemingly did in a 30-minute appearance off the bench in the 3-0 Champions League win away to Club Brugge of Belgium on Wednesday, but his return from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury is more nuanced than the Brazilian instantly finding form after an 11-month absence.

Players need time. These are human beings, not plug-in-and-play robots. Which is why Arteta has reintegrated his returning casualties differently over the course of the season.

For Jesus, there were seven months between the match in which he was injured and when he began doing on-pitch work again in August. At that point, some may have assumed his comeback was imminent, but another three months would pass before he played competitively again. He needed weeks of full training with the first team and two appearances in internal friendlies before Arteta deemed him ready, the manager pulling him back like a slingshot before finally flinging him onto the pitch in Bruges.

Asked if he could be as good post-ACL as he was before, or even better, Jesus’ answer after that midweek victory was unequivocal: “One hundred per cent.”

“It doesn’t matter about the chances I had (on the night),” he told reporters. “I got in good positions, I could finish the actions and hit the target. The three chances I had, I hit the target. Obviously, I had to score, but just to come back after 11 months and move the way I moved, I’m so pleased.”

After suffering a hamstring injury in the second game of the season, Bukayo Saka was out for almost a month before coming off the substitutes’ bench in the draw against Manchester City on September 21. Three days later, to the surprise of many, he was in the starting line-up for a Carabao Cup tie away to Port Vale of League One, English football’s third tier.

“He (Saka) needs minutes, and he’s demanding that as well,” said Arteta before that match, with the England international going on to play for an hour in a 2-0 Arsenal win. “Obviously, when he’s been out for a while, you just need to get in the rhythm. You need to get that confidence on the pitch and repeat actions and exposure.”

The need to find rhythm by repeating actions in-game would have been why Madueke, Martinelli and Gyokeres all started against Club Brugge, with their returns having varied levels of success.

Madueke’s direct running was what excited people early on in his Arsenal career following a summer move from Chelsea. Before starting on Wednesday, and scoring two of the goals, the England international winger had played 169 minutes from a possible 450 in the previous five games to build momentum and confidence. Similarly, Martinelli had featured in 144 of a possible 360 (four matches) before the trip to Belgium, but only looked comfortable taking on his man after the break.

Unsurprisingly, both finished the Club Brugge game having attempted and completed more dribbles than any other player. Martinelli completed three of his six attempted dribbles, Madueke two of his four.

The return of multiple players in the same position has allowed Arteta to patiently reintroduce Martinelli and Madueke. This could also help on Havertz too, with Arteta recently saying the German forward is now only weeks away from a comeback having been out since August with a knee injury, though he didn’t confirm whether that would happen before the end of the calendar year.

However, the manager hasn’t had the same luxury in other positions, something which has been particularly noticeable at right-back for several seasons.

“We don’t have time to train (because Arsenal play so many matches),” Arteta explained. “So training is not there. But obviously the fact that you are missing players, (means) you are loading other players more (as) a consequence. It’s a really dangerous circle.”

In Ben White’s first two seasons as a right-back for the club (2022-23 and 2023-24), serious calf and knee injuries to Takehiro Tomiyasu and Jurrien Timber respectively meant he started 71 of the 75 league games he was available for, sometimes playing through pain to do so. Come 2024-25, White required knee surgery in November. With Tomiyasu again unavailable, Timber was Arsenal’s fifth most-used outfield player last season. As the season was reaching its conclusion in May, he had an ankle operation.

If Arsenal beat Crystal Palace in a Carabao Cup quarter-final on December 23, they face the prospect of having a midweek game every week until February across the various competitions.

Before the 2-0 league win against Brentford last Wednesday, Arteta said the inability to train properly meant the focus between matches was “much more on principles and what we have to do, and then tweaking that in relation to the opponent’s strengths and weaknesses”.

Arsenal are about to have the rare luxury of a full week’s training, with seven days between the league fixtures at home to Wolves on Saturday and away to Everton on December 20 because of the postponement of that Palace tie due to the south Londoners’ ongoing UEFA Conference League commitments.

Once Christmas is out of the way, however, Arteta will need to ensure those who are returning from injuries are getting the right exposure to match action at the right time.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/11115214/GettyImages-2251248693-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-12 10:03:41.858093

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

No practice

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

S Kerby Joseph (knee) — Downgraded from limited practice

S Brian Branch (Achilles)

Decker typically sits out at least one practice each week, as part of his injury management program. And while missing a second practice is not unusual, it’s been a while since it’s happened, and it’s worth keeping an eye on.

Joseph returned to practice last week, but only practiced one day, while sitting out the other two practices. The All-Pro safety was already on the practice field on Wednesday this week, so a rest day on Thursday could be part of the rehabilitation plan. While this absence does not necessarily indicate a setback, it’s also not encouraging for his chances of playing this weekend.

Branch’s continued appearance on the injury report is only because they have not placed him on injured reserve. This is merely a formality at this point, as he has already had successful surgery on his Achilles and is clearly done for the season.

Limited practice

RB Sione Vaki (thumb)

WR Kalif Raymond (ankle)

TE Shane Zylstra (knee, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 10

LG Christian Mahogany (fibula, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 19

LG Kayode Awosika (foot)

S Thomas Harper (concussion)

Vaki’s thumb injury continues to limit him in practices, but he’s been good to go in games. If the thumb injury is a sprain, it could linger a bit longer, but if it’s a break, he may be dealing with this for the remainder of the season.

Raymond returned to practice on Wednesday after missing the previous two games. Special teams coordinator Dave Fipp insisted that once available, Raymond will return to his punt returner role, but also acknowledged Tom Kennedy has done enough to keep the kick return role. Raymond would also likely return to a WR3/4 role on offense, likely splitting time with rookie Isaac TeSlaa.

Zylstra has stacked another practice, and with the Lions releasing two tight ends in the last two days, the writing on the wall suggests Zylstra has a good chance of being removed from injured reserve and added back to the 53-man roster as early as this weekend.

Mahogany is just two days into his injury evaluation window and appears to be progressing well. While he has suggested he wants to try to return this week, the more likely scenario is that he would make his return for the Lions’ Week 16 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers or the Week 17 game in Minnesota.

Awosika missed last week’s game due to a mid-week foot injury, but his stacking two practices is a good sign that he may be able to return to the starting left guard position. Things are still a bit up in the air—will Awosika or Mahogany be ready?—but the Lions could always turn back to veteran Trystan Colon, who has started each of the last two weeks.

Harper has now practiced for two days in a row and appears to be on the right track to be cleared from the League’s concussion protocol in time to play on Sunday. With Branch headed to injured reserve and Joseph looking like he could miss another week, the Lions would really benefit from having Harper available.

Full practice

LB Alex Anzalone (illness) — upgraded from no practice

Anzalone didn’t practice on Wednesday due to an illness, but he was back at practice on Thursday, suggesting he’s on track to play on Sunday. Anzalone is a unique cog in the Lions’ defense, and with the Rams on the docket, Detroit will surely need his coverage skills.

,,2025-12-12 11:21:52+00:00,NFL.com,Week 15 fantasy sleepers: 10 high-upside lineup picks for playoff success - NFL.com,Marcas Grant,,,,,https://www.nfl.com/news/week-15-fantasy-sleepers-10-high-upside-lineup-picks-for-playoff-success,"Guys like Tyler Shough or Shedeur Sanders , who appeared in this column last week, have far tougher matchups in Week 15.
His 2.48 fantasy points in Week 14 aren’t inspiring.
But he could become the 10th quarterback to reach 15 fantasy points against Tampa this season.
Big Blue is giving up the second-most fantasy points per game to running backs.
He topped 20 touches in Weeks 11 and 12 and was on his way before the injury in Week 13.","And so it begins.

The fantasy playoffs are upon us. That went fast, no? It seemed like one minute we were hot-taking about whether Saquon Barkley was a first-round pick. The next, we were praying Saquon could just find the end zone one more time to help us squeeze into the playoffs.

(The answers to those existential queries were ""no"" and ""yes"".)

There now just three kinds of people. Those with a bye, those in the consolation bracket. And you. Because you, dear reader, are still lucky enough to have games ahead of you but not fortunate enough to get the week off. No matter. The Sleepers column is back with its first postseason edition of 2025. If you're just tuning in, well ... that would be weird. It's Week 15. Where have you been?

As always, I've got some alternative options to help you through a pinch. Don't worry, I'm not going to make a case for Philip Rivers. Although if the vibes around quarterback streamers continue to look this dour, I don't rule anything out.

Let's not think about that right now. Let's focus on the present. At present, your job is to survive and advance. That might mean some creative lineup management. And to help with that ... here are some names.

It’s a tough week for streaming quarterbacks. Guys like Tyler Shough or Shedeur Sanders , who appeared in this column last week, have far tougher matchups in Week 15. Anyone hoping to slot in Riley Leonard in place of the injured Daniel Jones will need to keep an eye on this week’s injury reports. So it is with much trepidation that I present to you Mr. Jonathan James McCarthy.

Last week, he crept into the top 12 thanks to three touchdown passes. But there have been more tricks than treats in his fantasy bag this year. However, Michael F. Florio pointed out on the NFL Fantasy Football Podcast that McCarthy’s worst games have come against either elite defenses or defenses seeing him for a second time. The Dallas Cowboys are neither. While the 'Boys are improved, they’re still prone to giving up big passing days. I wouldn’t recommend starting McCarthy outside of two-QB formats, but there is QB2 upside -- especially if the Vikings are chasing points in the second half.

Did I mention it’s a rough week for streaming quarterbacks? Because yeah. Cousins’ return to starter status has been snooze-worthy at best, stomach-churning at worst. His 2.48 fantasy points in Week 14 aren’t inspiring. Nor is the prospect of Atlanta enduring another week without Drake London . Above the protestations of many Falcons fans, the team is required by NFL bylaws to suit up and play this week. And so it goes.

Also struggling is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers pass defense. The Bucs have allowed the sixth-most passing yards in the NFL. In Weeks 10-13, they gave up an average of 290 yards per game. That feels like a tall bar for Cousins to reach at this point. But he could become the 10th quarterback to reach 15 fantasy points against Tampa this season. That’s enough to make him a QB2 in most formats this week.

Mitchell left last week’s loss to Pittsburgh with a knee injury. That’s the bad news. The good news is he is listed as day-to-day and has practiced this week. The better news is that Mitchell is coming off his best game since suffering a torn ACL in 2023. The best news is that he and the Ravens are facing the Bengals this week.

Mitchell did the most with his two carries, scoring a touchdown, when these teams met on Thanksgiving night, though game script forced Baltimore to throw more than it might have liked to. While the young back isn’t playing a ton of snaps, when he is on the field, he’s usually touching the ball. He’s also regained his explosive form, averaging 6.3 yards per carry (he averaged 6.5 yards per carry in his breakout rookie performances). Cincinnati continues to be the best matchup for running backs this season. Even with limited opportunities, Mitchell could have some flex appeal in deeper leagues.

First, let me start by saying that you can drop Jacory Croskey-Merritt . He’s still rostered in more than 50 percent of NFL.com leagues. Stop that. It was fun for a couple of weeks. But it’s over. The Commanders have turned to Rodriguez to lead their backfield and while that level of responsibility is a bridge too far for most fantasy managers, giving Rodriguez a spot in your lineup might not be.

Since Week 9, C-Rod (can we call him that?) leads Washington’s backfield in snaps and rush attempts. He also has a healthy 28 percent route participation -- even if the target share is woefully low. More importantly, he’s getting half of the team’s goal-line work. This week, he takes that up against the Giants and their 31st-ranked run defense. Big Blue is giving up the second-most fantasy points per game to running backs. Rodriguez doesn’t have the highest ceiling, but the matchup is favorable enough to make him a deep league flex this week.

We may have seen the rise of TreVeyon Henderson in recent weeks, but that doesn’t mean Stevenson has gone away. In the two games since returning from a toe injury, Stevenson has commanded nearly half of the rushing attempts and 75 percent of snaps in the two-minute offense.

Those numbers could come down a tick after the Patriots’ bye, but it keeps the veteran in play against the woeful Buffalo run stoppers. The Bills have looked better the past two weeks, but their 28th-ranked run defense has led to the seventh-most favorable matchups to RBs. Add Stevenson’s role in the passing game and he has flex value.

Despite leaving New York’s last game with a hip injury, Tracy appears on track to play after Big Blue’s bye week. Since the Giants lost Cam Skattebo , Tracy has maintained a healthy snap share and nearly 50 percent of the team’s rushing attempts. He’s also managed to carve out a meager target share as well. He topped 20 touches in Weeks 11 and 12 and was on his way before the injury in Week 13.

If styles make fights, then New York’s run-heavy offense should find the underbelly of the Commanders' 29th-ranked run defense. Washington has allowed a top-24 running back in four straight games. Tracy doesn’t have the highest ceiling, but he tops as a high-end RB2 in this week’s positive matchup.

What might have been for Pearsall in 2025. He started hot, leading the Niners in receiving yards through the first four weeks. Then a PCL sprain kept him out for six games. His return has been disappointing, to say the least. In three games, Pearsall has nine targets, five catches and 20 yards. Oof.

Whatever postseason aspirations the 49ers have will need to include Pearsall in some way. His snap share and route participation have been solid. The target share has been lacking. This is a good week to change that. The Titans are in the bottom seven in passing yards allowed to wideouts. The Niners offense has been disjointed this season, but if Brock Purdy and company can find a rhythm, Pearsall is in line for a big play or two. For managers in deeper leagues, he’s an upside flex.

The Titans offense is still a work in progress. But there have been some bright spots. Among them has been Dike. The rookie has made more of a name for himself as a return specialist, but he’s also flashed at times as a receiver. Dike has four weekly finishes inside the top 24 wide receivers. In three of those four, he tallied more than 16 points.

He matches up well against the 49ers this week. Dike spends more than half of his snaps from the slot. San Francisco has been one of the friendliest defenses to players in that alignment. Expect the Titans to be in the familiar position of chasing points in the second half. There should be plenty of targets to be had. Another top-24 finish for Dike wouldn’t be surprising.

It’s a rough week on the tight end front. The best matchups belong to guys who are bona fide starters and don’t belong in this column. George Kittle against the Titans. Tyler Warren against the Seahawks. Isaiah Likely against the Bengals. Or there are guys who are too much of a stretch to consider them in any situation. Are you really trusting your playoff life to AJ Barner , Chigoziem Okonkwo or T.J. Hockenson ?

That brings us to Freiermuth. He resides in the center of the Venn diagram with categories such as good matchup, decent usage and quality talent. The Dolphins have been tight end friendly this season, giving up the third-most points to the position. With Darnell Washington in concussion protocol, there’s an opportunity for Freiermuth to absorb some of his snaps and targets. Freiermuth isn’t a must-start but he could be a low-end TE1 in the right situation.

This hasn’t been a great year defensively for the 49ers. You’ve heard about it ad nauseum by now, but they’ve played much of the season without their two best defensive players in Nick Bosa and Fred Warner . Nonetheless, Robert Saleh has cobbled together a top-10 stop unit without a front four that causes many quarterbacks any distress.

The good news for San Francisco is that every defense has caused Cam Ward distress this year. The rookie is tied with Geno Smith as the quarterbacks who have been sacked the most in 2025 -- a mark Ward is likely to own by himself with Smith unlikely to play this week. One thing the Niners have done well lately is force turnovers. Saleh’s group has nabbed seven takeaways in its past three games. That jibes well against an offense that is above league average in giving the ball away. San Francisco is a solid streaming option for the opening of the fantasy playoffs.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/yg2jd7gyymmwfplnmsib,N,,2025-12-12 12:03:12.539472

""He was experiencing some discomfort when he was at the facility yesterday, and so we took him to the docs and they're going through some procedures,"" coach Mike Tomlin said following Thursday's practice. ""He stayed overnight in the hospital. He has a lung situation that's being addressed. I think he has some testing and so forth ahead of him this afternoon, and that's all I know at this juncture.

Watt's lung injury occurred during treatment at the team facility Wednesday, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Watt has been hospitalized since then, the sources said.

Tomlin said he ""got wind of"" the incident when Watt was in the team cafeteria at one point Wednesday.

""We know that he's doing better, but it definitely hurts when one of our teammates is in the hospital,"" said fellow pass rusher Alex Highsmith, who added that he has been in touch with Watt over the past day.

""... It's definitely a scary situation, tough situation. I've just been praying for him. I know he's getting better.""

The NFL Players Association is aware of the situation and has been in touch with Watt and his representation.

Watt had six tackles, including one for loss, and a quarterback hit in the win against the Ravens on Sunday where he played 68 (88%) defensive snaps.

The former Defensive Player of the Year and four-time All-Pro, who signed a three-year, $123 million extension in July, has 7 sacks, 3 forced fumbles and 1 interception this season along with 18 quarterback hits and 10 tackles for loss in 13 games this season.

Watt's status wasn't among the health concerns detailed by coach Mike Tomlin at Tuesday's news conference.

Both Johnson and Carter were listed as non-participants to begin the week and Dickerson was listed as limited as the Eagles held a Wednesday walkthrough on a short week. Backup swing tackle Fred Johnson popped up on the report as a limited participant, which usually indicates that an injury happened during practice.

Did not participate: DT Jalen Carter (shoulders), G Landon Dickerson (calf/rest), T Lane Johnson (foot)

Limited: T Fred Johnson (ankle)

Full: LB Zack Baun (hand), LS Charley Hughlett (abdomen), T Cameron Williams (shoulder)

There was some hope that Lane Johnson would be able to return for this game after the Eagles didn’t place him on IR but it’s looking like he won’t be out there against the Raiders on Sunday.

Johnson, 35, suffered a Lisfranc sprain against the Lions on Nov. 16 and has already missed three games. He would have had to miss a minimum of four games had the Eagles put him on IR so there was some optimism he could be back for this game. But now it seems like next week against the Commanders is more realistic.

NFL

That means that veteran Fred Johnson is likely going to make his fourth consecutive start if he's healthy enough to go. On Sunday, he’ll be tasked with trying to slow down superstar rusher Maxx Crosby, who plays about 87% of his snaps on the left side of the defensive line.

Fred Johnson lined up at right tackle on Thursday in place of Lane Johnson and Brett Toth was at left guard in place of Dickerson.

Carter, 24, had a procedure on his shoulders last week and missed the Chargers game. He’s in line to miss his second straight game. Without Carter, the Eagles’ defensive line had a great day pressuring Justin Herbert on over 68% of his dropbacks in LA.

The only limited participant to start the week was LG Landon Dickerson (calf). Dickerson missed some snaps with that injury against the Chargers but was able to return in the second half. It’s worth noting that Dickerson did get a rest day last Friday.

Both of the full participants to start the week — LB Zack Baun (hand) and LS Charley Hughlett (abdomen) — were practicing again on Thursday.

The Eagles on Thursday opened the 21-day practice window for sixth-round offensive tackle Cameron Williams, who has been on IR since early in the season. The Eagles previously opened practice windows for fellow rookies Willie Lampkin and Myles Hinton but then shut them both down for the season when their windows expired.

Achane practiced Thursday, as coach Mike McDaniel said he would before the day’s drills, but was limited, according to both McDaniel and the team’s injury report.
“He’ll go through some of his assignments, and he’ll participate but it’ll be limited,” McDaniel said.
Tomlin-led Steelers McDaniel detailed his impression of facing the Steelers under coach Mike Tomlin.
“Twenty years of over-.500 football play,” Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said of what he sees from the Mike Tomlin-led Steelers.","MIAMI GARDENS — Miami Dolphins running back De’Von Achane continues to have a positive outlook toward playing Monday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers as the team’s practice week commenced.

Achane practiced Thursday, as coach Mike McDaniel said he would before the day’s drills, but was limited, according to both McDaniel and the team’s injury report.

Achane was wearing a red, non-contact jersey Thursday to avoid aggravation to the rib injury suffered in the second quarter of Sunday’s win at the New York Jets.

“He’ll go through some of his assignments, and he’ll participate but it’ll be limited,” McDaniel said. “It’ll be a gradual increase in activity and physicality.”

Achane hurt his ribs landing on the football he was carrying for a 29-yard gain down the right side on his last rushing attempt against the Jets.

He finished with 92 yards and a touchdown on just seven carries. Jaylen Wright took over after Achane’s departure for his first 100-yard rushing performance and first NFL touchdown.

Protecting his body will be vital against the Steelers, who rank No. 21 against the run.

“The good news is that how he earns a living is avoiding tacklers, and that’s what he’ll have to do,” McDaniel said. “Bumps and bruises, if you don’t have something in December, you’re probably playing football wrong.”

Whether Achane wears a flak jacket will be up to him, according to McDaniel, as the speedy running back appeared to experiment with one at Thursday drills.

“He looked good,” quarterback Tua Tagovailoa said of Achane. “They’re doing what they need to be cautious of him as he’s running the ball, catching.”

Other Dolphins injuries

Two Dolphins missed Thursday practice, and they’re key special teamers: defensive back Elijah Campbell (ankle/knee) and linebacker Caleb Johnson (shoulder).

Johnson is unlikely to play Monday, and Campbell is day to day, per McDaniel.

Linebacker Tyrel Dodson was off the injury report entirely after a hamstring tweak against New York on Sunday that caused him to exit momentarily.

Limited participants at Thursday’s practice were cornerback Rasul Douglas (foot), safety Ifeatu Melifonwu (thumb/groins), outside linebacker Chop Robinson (oblique), tight end Darren Waller (rest), long snapper Joe Cardona (hamstring) and offensive lineman Andrew Meyer (triceps). Meyer participated in his first practice in a designation to return from IR.

Watt hospitalized

The Steelers made a shocking announcement on outside linebacker T.J. Watt on Thursday.

“T.J. Watt is currently in a local hospital for further medical evaluation of his lung after experiencing discomfort at the practice facility on Wednesday,” the Steelers statement said. “He will not be at practice on Thursday, and his status for Monday night’s game vs. Miami is in question. Coach (Mike) Tomlin will provide more updates at the appropriate time.”

Tomlin later told reporters in Pittsburgh he didn’t know what prompted Watt’s lung discomfort and that further evaluation later Thursday would help determine his status.

Watt, who has seven Pro Bowls and four All-Pro selections in his career, leads the Steelers with seven sacks this season.

Also missing practice for the Steelers Thursday were defensive tackle Derrick Harmon (knee), left tackle Andrus Peat (concussion), cornerback James Pierre (calf) and wide receiver Ben Skowronek (hand). Pittsburgh had tight end Darnell Washington and linebacker Malik Harrison as both are navigating concussion protocol.

Tomlin-led Steelers

McDaniel detailed his impression of facing the Steelers under coach Mike Tomlin.

“Twenty years of over-.500 football play,” Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said of what he sees from the Mike Tomlin-led Steelers. “I mean, that’s been the scope of my career, is being able to inspire a group of individuals to come together and win more than they lose. I think that, within that, there’s a lot of pride in the organization and the team. I think guys play physically every year, regardless of what the nameplates are, and they find a way to play sound football and they become pretty hard to beat.”

Indeed, the Steelers have never finished below .500 under Tomlin, as his team is 7-6 deep into his 19th season.

“I’ve played him multiple times, and it’s always been that same story,” McDaniel said. “You have to go earn a win. It will not be handed to you.”",https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tfl-z-dolphins2-24.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-12 07:01:02.818115

The Chiefs’ Thursday practice reports showed offensive linemen Wanya Morris (knee) and Jawaan Taylor (triceps/knee) did not practice, while linebacker Nick Bolton was held out with an illness.

Hollywood Brown returned from a personal day, and Trent McDuffie continued limited work.

The challenge is the timing, as the Los Angeles Chargers (9-4) come into Arrowhead on Sunday and the Chiefs (6-7) have virtually no room left to slip if they want to stay in the playoff hunt.

Morris’ knee injury, sustained in Sunday’s loss to the Houston Texans, has been characterized by multiple outlets as season-ending, removing a rotational lineman who had been pressed into starting work this month.

Taylor, a regular starter on the right side, is dealing with a triceps strain and lingering knee trouble; he missed last Sunday and was again listed as DNP on Thursday, leaving his status for Sunday’s matchup uncertain.

The Chiefs have shuffled their tackle spots all season, and QB Patrick Mahomes has taken 29 sacks — 17th-most in the NFL.

Offensively, Mahomes has thrown for 3,398 passing yards and 22 touchdown passes with a QBR of 69.4, along with 407 rushing yards and four rushing TDs, giving the offense an added dimension.

But the Texans game highlighted how protection issues can snowball into turnovers and stalled drives; Mahomes struggled in the loss (160 yards, three interceptions, no touchdowns), and the ongoing attrition up front only raises the risk of more breakdowns.

With four games remaining (Chargers, Titans, Broncos, Raiders), every week now carries added weight.

Buckner sustained the injury late in the first half of the Colts' Week 9 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
He was on the sidelines for those games, as well as the Colts' Week 13 home game against the Houston Texans, lending a voice when he could.
Buckner still needs to be activated off injured reserve to play, as the Colts opened his 21-day window to begin practicing on Wednesday.
""We've been taking the right steps to get back on the field,"" Buckner said.","Colts defensive tackle DeForest Buckner was a limited participant again in practice Thursday, after being limited on Wednesday – which was his first practice since being placed on injured reserve with a neck injury prior to Week 10.

Buckner sustained the injury late in the first half of the Colts' Week 9 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He figured he sustained a stinger, and he returned to the game in the second half.

But by the Wednesday after that game, he had lost all strength in the left side of his upper body. Buckner – one of the strongest players on the Colts – couldn't even do a push-up. A scan was done, and it turned out Buckner had a herniated disc in his neck that was pressing on a nerve.

Buckner knew he'd be out for at least four games, but he also didn't know if he'd need surgery to alleviate the issues he was having. The hope was, with treatment and rehab, his strength would return and he'd be able to avoid surgery.

Buckner flew to Panama to get stem cell injections in his neck – he saw the same doctors, who were recommended to him by a few ex-teammates with the San Francisco 49ers, last year when he was placed on injured reserve with a back injury. And then he began a grueling, lonely rehab process, spending hours at the Indiana Farm Bureau Football Center getting treatment while staying sharp working with his personal coach at Ozwell Fitness in Carmel.

And, eventually, Buckner began feeling better.

""It was definitely challenging day by day, especially early on when I didn't know if I was gonna get my strength back or not,"" Buckner said. ""And it was a process, but I got to a spot where I was consistently getting strength, and obviously that was encouraging and brought a lot more confidence.""

One thing Buckner did make sure of, though, was that he was on the plane with the Colts for road games against the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars. He was on the sidelines for those games, as well as the Colts' Week 13 home game against the Houston Texans, lending a voice when he could. Buckner also would pop into meetings during the week after he was done with treatment to try to help where he could.

""Trying to be a player coach as much as possible, and slash cheerleader,"" Buckner said. ""It's definitely challenging. Being on IR, it can definitely be lonely, frustrating, because you're kind of not part of the team but you are part of the team.""

Buckner still needs to be activated off injured reserve to play, as the Colts opened his 21-day window to begin practicing on Wednesday.

""We've been taking the right steps to get back on the field,"" Buckner said. ""And you guys know how I am, I'm doing whatever I can to be out there on the field. Now that we opened my practice window, just seeing how we go moving forward.""

Just because Buckner can be activated from injured reserve for Week 15 does not mean he's guaranteed to play Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks at Lumen Field. Buckner can be activated off injured reserve any time in the next three weeks, and while he's pushing to get back on the field as soon as possible, on Thursday he remained unsure of when that'll exactly be.

""We're just taking it day by day, seeing how it goes,"" Buckner said. ""Getting acclimated back out there and everything and seeing how my neck responds to consistently getting more volume.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/k5sdap9qzpjw8iqsyajx,N,,2025-12-12 00:00:47.594128

Wide receiver has already been a popular position atop many New Orleans Saints mock drafts. Even here at LouisianaSports.Net, wideouts from Arizona State, Jordyn Tyson and Indiana, Elijah Sarratt, have found their way into the first or second round in draft exercises.

Unfortunately, the pool of top wideouts has now taken a big hit with one prospect familiar with Saints’ rookie quarterback Tyler Shough having suffered a major knee injury.

Per ESPN’s Adam Schefter and Pete Thamel, Louisville wide receiver and Shough’s former teammate Chris Bell suffered a torn ACL.

The two appeared in 12 games together last year, combining for 37 receptions, 677 receiving yards and two touchdown connections. Bell added six receptions for 60 yards to his season total in the team’s bowl game against the Washington Huskies.

Bell produced well in his 11 games in 2025, reeling in 72 receptions for 916 receiving yards and six touchdown catches.

A “clean” ACL tear is typically seen as a more favorable injury than a rupture or incomplete tear. But surgery and recovery time are still substantial. This could potentially keep Bell out for around half of the season in 2026 and is sure to impact his draft stock.

The Saints should absolutely be interested in this year’s talented class of wideouts in the next NFL Draft. But Bell’s name will now carry an injury tag that may make it challenging to consider reuniting Shough with his top option from 2024.",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/3859/files/2025/12/2025-10-18t025641z-1724488589-mt1usatoday27349804-rtrmadp-3-ncaa-football-louisville-at-miami.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 00:00:52.301585

Here's a look at the top news from the Cowboys, Vikings and the NFL as a whole.","The Dallas Cowboys returned to the practice field for the first time since their Thursday Night loss to Detroit. The mini-bye week was supposed to cure most of the teams bumps and bruises but a few injuries continue to linger for this team.

Cornerback Trevon Diggs was among the walking wounded and although he is apparently healthy enough to play, there's a huge question about whether he'll play this week, or any week remaining in the season. Left tackle Tyler Guyton and safety Malik Hooker missed practice, but wideout CeeDee Lamb (concussion) was among several players who hit the field despite injury concerns.

Minnesota, the Cowboys' upcoming opponent, is managing injures of their own as two major players on offense missed practice and 12 others participated in limited fashion mainly for rest. One of those limited players is receiver Jordan Addison who continues to manage the achilles he ruptured that ended his season last year. The Vikings also added linebacker Josh Ross to their roster to help with the final stretch of the season.

Phillip Rivers, 44, suited up for Indianapolis to try and help their fading playoff chances, and seems poised to see his first game action in five seasons. In other league news, the NFL has shortened the time allotment for teams to make their first-round draft picks, hopefully getting folks to bed at a reasonable hour. The league has also backed a new flag football venture. Here's a look at the top news from the Cowboys, Vikings and the NFL as a whole.

Lamb sustained a concussion in the third quarter of the Cowboys' Dec. 4 loss to the Detroit Lions when his head hit the ground after he leaped to make a catch.

Speaking after Thursday's practice, Lamb said he does not have any apprehension in his return.

""Nah, in a situation like that, bro, as far as getting hurt or getting a concussion, it's not like you're thinking about, 'Oh, what if? What if I get hurt again?'"" Lamb said. ""I feel like if you live in that realm and you feed that fuel it's going to happen. And you don't want to live in a realm like that it's never going to happen again. Really, it's [about] staying level, just being positive about each and every opportunity you get and just staying blessed.""

Lamb sustained a concussion in 2021 and missed one game.

The 10-day break between the Lions and Vikings games was advantageous to the star wideout, who said he has not had any symptoms as he has worked through the protocol. He went through a limited part of Wednesday's practice.

Lamb said he saw a replay of the play on which he was concussed.

""It was all over my phone. I couldn't miss it,"" he said. ""I will say: I remember everything. I wasn't -- I don't know, I can't say I wasn't knocked out because clearly I was -- but I remember everything.""

Lamb recently switched helmets and wears a Guardian Cap during practices, but he said he will not wear one in games.

""It's not comfortable,"" he said.

Lamb also defended fellow Cowboys receiver George Pickens, who was criticized for his effort by Amazon Prime analyst Richard Sherman after catching five passes for 37 yards in the loss to the Lions.

""I just feel like they were waiting on him to have a bad game,"" Lamb said. ""It was quiet all season and he was averaging 100 [yards], 110, doing crazy things, but the one opportunity that he get, he didn't step up to their appreciation. And I feel like for us to come out victorious it wasn't just all on him. Once one of us go out, D-coordinators are very smart. It's not like I go out and they stay playing the same coverage. I mean they're going to lean coverage to him. They're going to cheat. They're going to do different things. People are smart. People understand football. I don't know why it's like that, I don't know, people just act like it's just night and day. They got jobs too over there. Them people don't want to get fired and they know if they let G spin by himself somebody's getting fired.""

Pickens has not addressed the media yet this week, but quarterback Dak Prescott said the receiver has been ""amazing.""

""He's responded great. Just came in like a pro, as I expected him to do,"" Prescott said.

""When you're playing to the level he is and to the standard or anybody's expectations when you play the way that he does ... he owns that. He's had a hell of a week of practice, and he's going to continue to finish that way. There's no doubt all that is going to just transpire into the game.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1205%2Fr1585169_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 00:01:00.218569

Yet, several players will be spending time on the sidelines.

Knowing about injuries to key players is an essential piece for NFL fans and fantasy managers at this time, too. They will want to know who might be out or limited in upcoming games. Here’s a breakdown of notable injuries and what you need to know.

De’Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins

Dolphins running back De’Von Achane suffered a rib injury when he fell on the football during Sunday’s victory over the New York Jets. An MRI was done on Achane’s injured ribs, and it didn’t indicate that he’d suffered a fracture.

While no official word on Achane’s condition was released on Tuesday, Achane may sit out a few of this week’s practices ahead of Miami’s game on Monday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

If Achane is unavailable for the Monday night game, look for Jaylen Wright to get a few more touches.

Benson has been dealing with a meniscus injury. Benson has not played since Week 4. He will have to be activated this week or will miss the rest of the 2025 season.

On Tuesday, Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon offered an update on Benson’s situation in an interview with a Phoenix sports radio station.

“I know he’s doing everything he can to get back out there,” Gannon said. “You know, we opened his window a little bit ago. The return to play, like all return to plays, is not linear. Every guy’s a little bit different. But he’s working at it, and we’re, we got a good plan for him and hopefully can get back out there.”

Alvin Kamara, RB, New Orleans Saints

Update 12/10: Saints running back Alvin Kamara did not practice with the team.

Kamara has missed the last two games with knee and ankle injuries. No update was given on Tuesday regarding Kamara’s status.

On Monday, however, Saints head coach Kellen Moore said, “We’ll see” regarding a return this coming Sunday and considered him “questionable.” The Saints will release their first injury report on Wednesday, at which time further details about Kamara will be available.

According to the PFSN NFL RB Impact metrics, Kamara has an impact score of 70.9 and grades out to a C-. For the season, Kamara has 131 carries for 471 yards and one touchdown.

Aaron Rodgers had one of his best games of the season last week and completed four passes of 20 yards or more.","When you bet on sports long enough, most of your gambling stories end up blending together and fading from memory. It takes a true outlier event, a stunningly bad beat or a historically improbable win, for a betting memory to become a “where were you” moment. And while most normal sports fans will forget about Daniel Carlson’s 46-yard field goal as time expired in the Raiders’ 24-17 loss to the Broncos last Sunday, I will remember and cherish that kick forever.

It was one of the most improbable betting wins of my life. I called Cousin Sal in excitement to talk about how we had just pulled off an incredible gambling heist. I’ll probably never understand why Pete Carroll chose to kick that field goal. Or why Broncos safety Brandon Jones lay on top of Raiders receiver Tyler Lockett when time was about to expire. All I know is that the Raiders lost by fewer than 7.5 points. He might not be in the job for much longer, but Sunday was the moment that Carroll truly became Las Vegas’s football coach.

Now that we’re onto Week 15, bye weeks are over. This is the final normal scheduling week of the NFL regular season. That means 16 games, a loaded Sunday slate, and, unfortunately, some very one-sided matchups on paper.

Here are my thoughts on the entire Week 15 slate, including my favorite five bets. (All lines are from FanDuel as of Thursday morning.)

The Favorite Five

I’ll be highlighting my favorite five picks each week throughout the season, which will serve as a preview for my picks on The Ringer 107—a season-long contest between The Bill Simmons Podcast, The Ringer NFL Show, The Ringer Gambling Show, and The Ringer Fantasy Football Show. I’ll be partnering with Cousin Sal to make the Gambling Show’s Friday picks. Through 14 weeks, this column is 52-54-1 overall and 33-37 on the Favorite Five.

Buffalo Bills (–1.5) at New England Patriots

Like the Broncos, the Patriots are another team with an excellent record, and the betting market continues to be skeptical about this team. It’s highly unusual that the Broncos and Pats, the top two seeds in the current AFC playoff picture, both of which have multiple game leads over everyone else in the conference, would be home underdogs in the same week. Even though the Patriots dismantled the shoddy Giants defense with a superb Drake Maye performance the last time we saw them play, I think that it’s time for Buffalo to get its revenge for their first meeting earlier this season.

Let’s start with my concerns about New England: The Patriots run defense has been slipping in recent weeks. Before Milton Williams’s injury, New England had a top five run defense in rushing success rate allowed (Weeks 1-10). Since Williams left the Jets game with an injury in Week 11, the Patriots have slipped to 28th. The post-injury sample is admittedly only three games, but there have been real cracks in the foundation that Buffalo will be looking to exploit through James Cook and the power run game.

The Patriots have also struggled in the red zone, and that’s an area where Buffalo has a definite advantage because of its ability to unleash Josh Allen as a runner. The Patriots rank 24th in red zone touchdown percentage, while Buffalo sits at ninth. Against the Bengals in Week 12, the Patriots’ red zone issues nearly cost them late in the game, and it could happen again in another high-leverage close game. Their struggles stem from their inability to consistently run the ball.

Verdict: Bet Bills moneyline (–115)

Green Bay Packers (–2.5) at Denver Broncos

The Broncos and Packers enter Week 15 with two of the league’s three best defenses when it comes to preventing explosive plays. Both defenses excel at tackling underneath and have such dominant pass rushes that it’s difficult to consistently push the ball down the field or generate yards after the catch against them. Sunday will be a battle of which offense is able to be more methodical about moving the ball down the field with consistent first downs. Green Bay has had a few puzzling offensive performances this year, but the Packers are more reliable in series conversion rate—a metric that examines how often an offense moves the chains. The Packers rank fifth, while the Broncos sit at 19th.

The Broncos defense plays a lot of man coverage, and Jordan Love has been the league’s most efficient quarterback against that type of coverage. Love tries to push the ball downfield as much as any quarterback in the NFL, too, but Denver won’t make that as easy as Chicago did last week.

Despite Denver’s impressive 11-2 record, the betting markets still don’t believe that it is a truly elite team. The Broncos are the 11th-best team based on betting market odds, which is why they are a home underdog to Green Bay (third) by nearly a field goal.

Verdict: Bet under 43.5 (–110)

Cleveland Browns at Chicago Bears (–7.5)

If you’re the kind of person who believes in trap games, there’s no better example of a bad situational spot for a team than the Bears’ home game against Cleveland on Sunday. The lowly Browns come to Chicago and catch the Bears in the middle of their Green Bay twofer. One week after a heartbreaking last-minute loss, Chicago surely has one eye on the rematch with its rival at Soldier Field next week, which could very well decide the NFC North title.

The Bears should win this game. But this is still the first time all season that they have been favored by more than a touchdown. Chicago has vastly improved from Week 1 to now, but it is not without flaws. The passing game is not consistent. The pass rush ranks 28th in pressure rate. The Bears have been the late-game darlings of the NFL this year, but winning by margin doesn’t come easily to them.

The Browns defense might not be as dominant away from home, but this remains a good matchup for their run defense, which can slow Chicago down and keep the game within a score. Chicago does have the fifth-highest rush rate, and the steady improvement and recent explosion of their run game has been the primary driver of their 9-4 record. But Cleveland ranks first in the NFL in rushing success rate allowed.

Verdict: Bet Browns +7.5 (–110)

Las Vegas Raiders at Philadelphia Eagles (–11.5)

A wise man would not be dying to jump back in to bet on the Raiders after their absolute miracle cover on Sunday. A wise man would take the money he made last week and run. But I am not a wise man. And I am not sure that this price can be justified given the current state of the Eagles offense. The Eagles have played 13 football games this season, and they have been above average in EPA per drive in only three of them. Their offense cannot consistently move the ball and is heavily reliant on explosive plays to be successful.

The Raiders defense is not good, but it is sixth best at preventing big plays. Defensive coordinator Patrick Graham likes to sit in zone defense and keep his safeties high. Last year, the Eagles would have been able to run the ball effectively and force Graham to change his looks. They have not shown that they can do that this season.

If you can stomach a bet on the Raiders and Kenny Pickett, I’d consider the under instead, but the Eagles need to prove that they can win by margin first. They’ve won one game all season by multiple scores.

Verdict: Bet Raiders +11.5 (–110)

Los Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (–5.5)

The Chargers pulled out the win against the Eagles in dramatic fashion on Monday night, but it’s hard to feel good about how their offense looked after a clearly hampered Justin Herbert finished 12-of-26, with just 5.3 yards per attempt. Herbert’s accuracy seemed limited by his left hand injury, and while he scrambled for 66 yards to keep the offense afloat, the constant pressure on him will likely continue to affect his performance. Herbert was pressured on 63.4 percent of his dropbacks on Monday night, and he had multiple turnovers. Now, he’ll face a defense that will bring pressure as much as possible. A healthy Herbert with a nearly full-strength offensive line carved open the Chiefs defense in the first week of the season, but now they’re facing a much different challenge at a raucous Arrowhead Stadium.

It seems like the dam could break for the Chargers offense in this game. They’ve kept afloat in most games—Jacksonville in Week 12 aside—since Joe Alt got injured again. But how long can they keep sustaining the offense with turnstile offensive lineman who are allowing absurd pressure rates?

I hate to sound like a broken record in this column, but the market continues to have immense respect for the quality and pedigree of the Chiefs. The betting markets still rate the Chiefs as the best team in the AFC, even if it is highly unlikely that they’ll make the playoffs now. If you were hoping for a discount to bet Kansas City, the betting markets won’t give you one.

The path to beating the Chargers defense is committing to the run game and methodically moving the ball. I’m not sure that the Chiefs can do the first part without making this game quite slow and low scoring.

Verdict: Bet under 41.5 (–110)

Thursday Night Football

Atlanta Falcons at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (–4.5)

It would be easy to call this a must-win for the Buccaneers, but the reality is that their season will come down to their two matchups against Carolina in Weeks 16 and 18. The Bucs are activating wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan from injured reserve before this game. I suspect that they are trying to ease Evans and McMillan in so that both will be ready for the more important upcoming games.

This Tampa Bay season started with a ton of promise; Baker Mayfield was rescuing a bunch of games in the final moments, but he’s been one of the worst quarterbacks in the entire league since Week 7. Some of that is certainly a result of all the injuries to the skill group and maybe even an injury to Mayfield himself, but we’re at a point where Tampa Bay is extremely vulnerable week to week. I still want to keep fading the Buccaneers until Mayfield shows the league that he can put together a consistent four-quarter performance again.

The Falcons enter this game shorthanded on offense, as wide receiver Drake London is out yet again and tight end Kyle Pitts is questionable. But schematically, this is a great matchup for Bijan Robinson in the receiving game. The Bucs love to bring pressure, but Kirk Cousins has held up well against the blitz, and the Bucs are allowing the most receiving yards in the league to running backs.

Verdict: Bet Falcons +4.5 (–110) and Bijan Robinson over 36.5 receiving yards (–110)

The Rest of the Slate

Indianapolis Colts at Seattle Seahawks (–13.5)

Look, I’m not saying that I want to bet on some combination of Philip Rivers, Riley Leonard, and Brett Rypien at quarterback on Sunday. But it’s really hard to justify the market laying this many points on Seattle. The look-ahead line was Seattle –3.5. Even with the acknowledgment that look-ahead lines don’t have high liquidity and aren’t the best barometer of the real betting market, it’s quite a drastic one-week adjustment for this spread to jump 10 points. That said, the Colts will be without their top corners, as Charvarius Ward and Sauce Gardner are out, and they’ll have to protect their quarterback of choice without right tackle Braden Smith, who is in concussion protocol.

If the Colts do start Rivers, who practiced on Wednesday, it would basically be unprecedented. The only other quarterback who’s returned from a five-year hiatus to play football was Steve DeBerg in 1998. Forty-four-year-old DeBerg rejoined the Atlanta Falcons as the backup quarterback that season and finished 9-of-17, with two turnovers and three sacks, in his lone start. Even if Rivers and head coach Shane Steichen remain close friends who talk football all the time, there has to be some learning curve if you’re walking into an NFL offense during a game week and playing on Sunday. But Rivers might still be the best option if the alternative is a physically compromised Leonard (who has a knee injury).

This is a fascinating football experiment and a compelling human interest story. I might even find myself betting the Colts on the moneyline just in case Rivers does get the start. But much like we saw with the Vikings’ Max Brosmer start against Seattle two weeks ago, there’s a ton of variance in possible outcomes, and it’s worth investing in alternate spreads, depending on whether you think Phil can still sling it.

You also have to wonder whether the Seahawks will have one eye on their critical division clash against the Rams coming up on Thursday.

Verdict: Bet on alternate spreads in either direction, depending on whether you want to hate- or nostalgia-watch Rivers

Arizona Cardinals at Houston Texans (-9.5)

Five weeks ago, the Texans season was on life support; they sat at 3-5 following a loss at home to the Broncos. Houston had just lost starting quarterback C.J. Stroud to a concussion and faced a gauntlet of an upcoming schedule. The underlying metrics always suggested that Houston was better than its record, and as it turns out, everyone—including the betting markets—was underrating the Texans. Houston has won five in a row (and covered the spread in four), beating the Jaguars, Titans, Bills, Colts, and Chiefs to surge into the heart of the AFC South race.

Given the current state of the AFC—both the Chiefs and Ravens are in grave danger of missing the playoffs altogether—how many teams in the conference are definitely better than Houston? The offensive line went from abysmal to passable. The offense is hardly consistent, but running back Woody Marks and wide receiver Nico Collins have just enough explosive spark to put some points on the board consistently. Given that Houston’s defense is the best by EPA per drive of any unit since 2021, the offense doesn’t have to score much for the Texans to be a tough team to beat in the AFC playoffs.

Could this game serve as a bit of a breakout for the Houston offense? It’s one thing to struggle on the road against playoff-caliber defenses, but we have seen that when Stroud faces a defense that doesn’t generate much pressure, the offense becomes highly efficient. Houston moved the ball up and down the field against the very injured Ravens and 49ers defenses and now gets to face another shorthanded unit this Sunday. The Cardinals rank 27th in pressure rate, so Stroud should be kept relatively clean.

I wouldn't be surprised if Houston scores more than anticipated, but I’ll pass here.

Verdict: Pass

Tennessee Titans at San Francisco 49ers (–13.5)

Only the Panthers generate pressure at a lower rate than the San Francisco 49ers. The Niners posted quality defensive showings against Carolina and Cleveland over the past two weeks, but their underlying vulnerability remains. It’s next to impossible for me to lay that many points on a defense that creates so little havoc. Even if the Titans don’t score a lot of points, they should be able to move the ball somewhat consistently in this game, bleed the clock, and stay competitive. One of Cam Ward’s biggest problems has been his sack rate. That concern is somewhat alleviated by a matchup with this San Francisco defense.

Friends usually don’t let friends bet on the Titans, but they can also prevent you from laying nearly two touchdowns on a very flawed defense.

Verdict: Lean Titans +13.5 (–110)

Minnesota Vikings at Dallas Cowboys (-6.5)

The haters wrote J.J. McCarthy off this season. But last week, against the Commanders, he didn’t write back.

McCarthy had by far his best game as a professional quarterback last week and finally made the bettors who’d been blindly fading him pay up. On paper, Minnesota’s skill position players against the Dallas secondary is one of the biggest mismatches of the entire season. The Cowboys run defense may be improved, but their secondary still has serious holes that can be exploited by a capable offense.

On the other side, we’ve seen Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores get the better of plenty of great quarterbacks, but it will be difficult for him to scheme up pressure to rattle Dak Prescott. Prescott, especially at home, is elite at diagnosing defenses pre-snap. He excels against the blitz, has two elite wide receivers (when George Pickens cares), and loves to throw over the middle of the field. Flores's defenses will leave the middle open, and Prescott is sure to throw into the windows vacated by extra rushers. He ranks fourth in success rate against the blitz this season.

This has all the makings of a high-scoring matchup, if McCarthy can exploit a bad secondary.

Verdict: Lean over 47.5 (–110)

New York Jets at Jacksonville Jaguars (–13.5)

There are too many games with real intrigue and consequence in Week 15 for me to dive deep into a December matchup that might be started by Jets rookie QB Brady Cook. After a week of national media gushing about Trevor Lawrence, it would be very fitting if this game were close in the fourth quarter, even if it shouldn’t be.

Verdict: Pass

Carolina Panthers (–2.5) at New Orleans Saints

Tyler Shough had a ton of success in his first meeting with Carolina on the road this season, in part because the Panthers are dead last in pressure rate in the NFL. Shough threw for 282 yards on 27 attempts, and the Saints shut down the Carolina offense en route to a comfortable 17-7 win. Last week, we even saw a different dimension of the Saints rookie quarterback when he added two touchdowns with his legs. This is as friendly of a matchup as you can draw up for Shough, and I think that the Saints will be a very lively home underdog on Sunday as a result. Like the Buccaneers, the Panthers have a more important game coming up next Sunday.

While Carolina does have a rest advantage coming off the bye, it offers a pretty simple matchup for New Orleans to solve right now. If you can effectively stop the run and force Bryce Young into obvious passing downs, you can slow down the Panthers offense. New Orleans ranks 10th in rush success rate allowed, and Young is 41st out of 44 quarterbacks in EPA per dropback in obvious passing situations (third or fourth down and 6-plus yards).

Verdict: Bet Saints ML (+120)

Washington Commanders at New York Giants (–2.5)

Both teams began with varying degrees of promise but have quickly devolved as they've been infected by the injury bug. Jayden Daniels has more notable injuries than wins this season, and this hollowed-out version of the Giants offense without running back Cam Skattebo and wide receiver Malik Nabers is lacking any juice.

There is a case to be made right now that Marcus Mariota is running the Commanders offense better than Daniels was and that their run game should be able to move the ball against the porous Giants run defense. Even when teams have nothing to play for, you would expect the Commanders to respond after their absolute shellacking in Minnesota last week. Teams are 97-68-4 all time against the spread (59 percent) following a loss of 30-plus points, per Action Network.

Verdict: Lean Commanders +2.5, bet at +3

Baltimore Ravens (-2.5) at Cincinnati Bengals

These two teams played on Thanksgiving, and the Ravens closed as a 7.5-point favorite. The Bengals ended up winning comfortably in Baltimore, and both teams lost close coin-flip games last week. The question you have to answer now is whether it makes sense for oddsmakers to downgrade the Ravens by two or three points.

Given the current state of both Lamar Jackson and the Ravens pass rush, I think that the adjustment is correct. The Ravens were completely unable to pressure Aaron Rodgers effectively last week, and the Steelers had five plays of 20-plus yards. In the 12 weeks before that game, the Steelers offense had 30 total.

Until we see a healthier and more mobile version of Jackson, it’ll be hard to bet money on the Ravens. However, there’s a way to target Cincinnati’s awful tight end coverage by betting on the Ravens’ three tight ends—Isaiah Likely, Mark Andrews, and even Charlie Kolar—in the prop markets. Baltimore and Likely will be out to right a wrong after he fumbled while running into the end zone in that crucial Thanksgiving-night first half.

Verdict: Pass the game, but bet Likely to score a touchdown (+260)

Detroit Lions at Los Angeles Rams (–5.5)

The Rams’ slipup against the Panthers on the road two weeks ago was more a product of some poor plays by Matthew Stafford than an indication of true flaws within the roster. Stafford and his offense proved that when they pummeled the Cardinals last week, and the betting market now sees the Rams as the best team in the NFL. The Lions still have a quality run defense that can slow down the emerging one-two punch of running backs Kyren Williams and Blake Corum, but the Lions’ problems in this matchup are in the secondary. We know that Detroit likes to play a lot of man coverage, and the Rams rank third in the NFL in EPA per dropback against man coverage. The Packers and Cowboys are both in the top six in the same metric, and they just combined to score 61 points in two games against Kelvin Sheppard’s defense.

I’m not really sure what the Lions’ path is to get any real stops in this game, unless Stafford throws the ball to the other team a couple of times. I’d be tempted to play the over, assuming the Lions get extremely pass heavy while they’re trailing, but this total is 54.5 for a reason.

If I had to bet this, I’d lay the points with the Rams. But I don’t have to, so it’s just a lean to their side for me.

Verdict: Lean Rams –5.5 (–110)

Miami Dolphins at Pittsburgh Steelers (–3.5)

Mike Tomlin needs only two more victories to secure yet another winning season in Pittsburgh, and this is a prime opportunity for him to move one step closer. Aaron Rodgers had one of his best games of the season last week and completed four passes of 20 yards or more.

The Steelers had an uncharacteristically explosive showing last week, but both of these offenses love to use the short pass underneath to move the football consistently and methodically. Rodgers and Tua Tagovailoa are in the bottom six among QBs this year in average depth of target, yet it’s Pittsburgh whose defense is considerably better at defending against these types of passes.

The Steelers rank 14th in EPA per dropback allowed on passes within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage, while the Dolphins are way down at 28th. If this becomes a dink-and-dunk battle, I may trust the schematic chops of Mike McDaniel more, but I favor the talent and production of the Steelers. At 3.5, I’d lean with Miami, but not enough to bet on it.

Verdict: Lean Dolphins +3.5 (–105)

On top of starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. being out for the season after undergoing knee surgery, the Falcons are just 4-9 at the time of this writing. They have lost seven of their last nine games, with no real end in sight to their on-field woes. But divisional games are different. Divisional games are an opportunity to spoil a rival's season and play for pride. That's the exact opportunity the Falcons have ahead of them in Thursday night's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

It remains to be seen whether they will be entirely healthy for the game, though. (Outside of Penix, obviously.)

Starting tight end Kyle Pitts is listed as questionable for the game with a knee injury. Not having Pitts available, who has 62 catches for 631 yards this season, in a matchup where receiver Drake London has already been ruled out, would be a huge blow to Atlanta's chances of winning:

Outside linebacker Harold Landry III did not participate in Thursday’s practice. The veteran starter, who leads the team in sacks, tackles for loss and quarterback hits, had been available for the previous session in a limited capacity while managing a knee injury.

Running back Terrell Jennings also remained sidelined for the active roster as the AFC East rematch nears.

Jennings has resided in the NFL’s concussion protocol since the final game before the bye week.

He was downgraded to out for the rest of what became a 33-15 Monday night win.

Coming out of the break, No. 2 has been spotted during one practice in Foxborough.

Two Patriots practiced in a partial capacity on Thursday. Lowe, fresh off his first start of the year at left tackle, continues to work through an abdomen issue.

Mike Evans injury update The Buccaneers have not yet announced whether their top wide receiver will be back in action for tonight's game against the Falcons.
An announcement may not come until the team announces its inactive players for ""Thursday Night Football"".","The Tampa Bay Buccaneers dropped to 7-6 following their shocking 24-20 loss to the New Orleans Saints in Week 14.

Buccaneers all-time leading receiver Mike Evans is among the many injured playmakers this season for Tampa Bay. Evans has been out of action since suffering a broken collarbone in the team's loss to the Detroit Lions on ""Monday Night Football"" in Week 7.

The Bucs host the Atlanta Falcons (4-9) on ""Thursday Night Football"" on Thursday, Dec. 11. The question remaining is whether the star wide receiver will make his return.

Evans has been on injured reserve (IR) and had his practice window opened on Dec. 3 ahead of Week 14. He has logged limited practices every day since and the Buccaneers had 21 days to activate him from the time they opened his practice window.

Tampa Bay enters Week 15 with a 7-6 record – in the fourth spot in the NFC playoff picture – leaving little room for error. They are battling to stay atop the NFC South race and Bucs fans are hopeful their All-Pro wide receiver will be available today.

Here's the latest on Evans before the ""Thursday Night Football"" kickoff against the Falcons.

Mike Evans injury update

The Buccaneers have not yet announced whether their top wide receiver will be back in action for tonight's game against the Falcons. He was activated from Injured Reserve on Wednesday, opening the door for a potential return.

In the absence of any official news, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported that Evans is ""good to go"" for the Week 15 ""Thursday Night Football"" game against the Falcons. The veteran wideout will make his return from a broken collarbone after a six-game stint on injured reserve.

The NFC South leaders have been battered by injuries, but they have found ways to win despite the absence of some of their top players.

Evans has missed nine games this season, missing six of those since suffering the broken collarbone and he can now return to action tonight.

Evans practiced in a limited capacity for the second consecutive week and his status for tonight's game is still undetermined. An announcement may not come until the team announces its inactive players for ""Thursday Night Football"".

At the time of Evans' injury, it was reported he could return in December, and he has been on track to do so. The original timeline for return was about two months with no setbacks after Evans underwent surgery to repair the clavicle fracture, which the NFL Network described as a ""clean break.""

The eight-week timeline from the injury would have Evans on track to return for Week 15, when the Buccaneers host the Falcons on ""Thursday Night Football"" on Dec. 11, or in Week 16, when they play on the road against the Panthers on Dec. 21.

The Buccaneers remain in first place in the NFC South entering Week 15 but the Carolina Panthers are right on their heels with an identical record of 7-6. Tampa Bay would certainly stand to benefit if Evans can return during their playoff push during the final weeks of the regular season.

Jalen McMillan (activated from IR Wednesday)

Sterling Shepard

Ryan Miller

Kameron Johnson

Jaden Smith (IR – undisclosed)

The Buccaneers' receiving group has dealt with many injuries this season. Rookies Egbuka and Tez Johnson have stepped up while Evans, McMillan and Godwin have been sidelined.

Godwin has played the last three games but has not topped a 70% snap rate in any. Meanwhile, McMillan also had his 21-day practice window opened on Dec. 3 and continues to log limited practices. He was activated from IR alongside Evans. Additionally, Shepard - the 10-year veteran - has provided some consistency and depth.

And as he reflects on it further, the gravity of that moment settles in, and a cooler, wiser head prevails.
""Obviously, when you have to go to the tent, it was very clear you did not want to leave the game,"" he said.
Loving what he's seeing from Lamb after such a terrifying moment is his quarterback and one of his best friends, Dak Prescott, who also offered up words of praise and encouragement.
""Yeah, zero concern [about Lamb now],"" the All-Pro QB said.","FRISCO, Texas — The moment was a terrifying one for all who watched helplessly as CeeDee Lamb's helmet banged against the turf at Ford Field last week, the Dallas Cowboys' All-Pro wide receiver blacking out for a moment as his fingers locked, similar to what was witnessed on multiple occasions by Tua Tagovailoa, and it was immediately known he suffered a concussion against the Detroit Lions.

He was immediately removed from the contest and ruled out with said concussion, but he's made significant progress toward potentially clearing the league's protocol to take the field in Week 15 against the Minnesota Vikings.

""There's been a lot of work and eye discipline, and trying to frustrate myself, essentially, to see if I have any more residuals of the concussion, and any type of symptoms,"" said the four-time Pro Bowler. ""But as for me, now, it's just been heavy on rest, to be honest. I'm doing everything, meeting all my requirements, getting ahead of everything, and especially with the extra two to three days that we had off — I feel like that was big.""

As with most NFL athletes, being removed from the field, and particularly when they're on their way to having a career game, isn't something they take kindly to. Lamb was no different, trying to stick around to help the struggling Cowboys' offense avoid the eventual defeat in the Motor City, but he readily admits the neurologist and training staff saved him from himself in that situation.

And as he reflects on it further, the gravity of that moment settles in, and a cooler, wiser head prevails.

""Obviously, when you have to go to the tent, it was very clear you did not want to leave the game,"" he said. ""Is there also a part of you that's glad that those are in place to protect you from yourself and your future in football? Yeah, absolutely. They're doing their job, and obviously, me as a competitor, I want to do mine.

""But it's times where they do have to protect me from me, and that was the situation to where that was one of them. I felt like I was having a pretty good game. I was just kinda getting started — getting to cooking — and for me to really take myself out .. just putting myself out there, and I feel like, just giving my guys my all.

""… I'm happy for the training staff. I'm happy for everybody that's reached out. I'm happy for really just another opportunity of waking up and doing what I love again.""

Lamb made it to the team's charter flight to depart with his teammates, and with no assistance needed, bags or otherwise, then showing up to work out on Monday, and he's since returned to full practice duties — effective Thursday — more great signs that he does have ""only one or two"" more benchmarks to clear, per head coach Brian Schottenheimer, before being released from the league's concussion protocol.

Loving what he's seeing from Lamb after such a terrifying moment is his quarterback and one of his best friends, Dak Prescott, who also offered up words of praise and encouragement.

""Yeah, zero concern [about Lamb now],"" the All-Pro QB said. ""Obviously, on the field, you see a guy, whatever they call that, you know when his hands get into that [locked] formation, right? Whether it's your brother, teammate, or somebody on the other team, you don't want to see that. So, yeah, obviously, there is some urgency to get him help right then.

""But then, actually, when I got over there, he was almost like right back to it. I was like, 'You good?' And he's like, 'Yeah.' … I was positive in the way that he would respond, and he's been great.""

With only a couple days remaining before the Vikings march onto the field at AT&T Stadium, Lamb is on the right track, and a deep exhale is a justified response by all — a close call that turned out to be nothing more than that.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/bstxrtlxwn91jze6ava1,N,,2025-12-11 18:02:31.282611

""We have some other guys who got banged up during the course of play. Keeanu Benton had an ankle. He was able to go back and finish. I'm sure that will limit him some at the early portions of this week. James Pierre suffered a calf injury. He was able to finish but could impact him at the early portions of this week. Ben Skowronek, Yahya Black, and some others.""

One player who could be looked at as the arrow is pointing up is safety Kyle Dugger, after he missed the Ravens game.

""Kyle Dugger has a chance to come back this week from his hand injury, and the rest are bumps and bruises associated with play,"" said Tomlin.

Tomlin shared more information on receiver DK Metcalf, who remained in Baltimore overnight on Sunday for observation.

""He got hit in the abdomen or stomach in-game,"" said Tomlin. ""I think they gave him some basic over-the-counter remedies in-game, like Pepto, and it got probably progressively worse after the game.

""So, appreciative of our medical experts. We just exercised an abundance of caution. We didn't want to get him in the air without having a complete understanding about what he was dealing with, and they did a good job of that.

""He's moving in the right direction. I don't think it's going to jeopardize his availability at all, but it certainly may jeopardize his availability at the early portions of the week from a practice standpoint.

""Thankfully, he's fine. I'm appreciative of our medical staff and how quickly they acted in making sure he was safe and taking care of him postgame.""

Rookie defensive lineman Derrick Harmon has missed the last two games with a knee injury, but he is working his way back to the lineup.

""Derrick Harmon will be limited at the early portions of the week, and we'll let the amount of participation and how quickly it picks up and the quality of that participation as we go through the week to determine whether or not he's available,"" said Tomlin. ""Certainly excited about additional day as it pertains to him.""

With the Monday night game, the Steelers have an extra day for players to bounce back from injuries.

""Thankful that we have an additional 24 hours or so plus this week,"" said Tomlin. ""That's why we adjusted our schedules in the way that we've done. Sometimes when we play on Monday, particularly at the early stages of team development, we'll do Friday twice and hit a lot of or situational football and really get solid on some of that stuff.

""We just deemed it appropriate to give ourselves another additional 24 hours of recovery this week, and so that's why we've taken the approach that we've taken this week.

""Hopefully we'll get better clarity regarding some player availability. We'll give guys some additional time to rest and recuperate and be able to put their hand in the pile in terms of participating in the process of the game readiness, and certainly it's important this time of year that we have that as the road gets narrow.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/steelers/mgdlvcfcmimziiv3dffu,N,,2025-12-11 17:03:21.218809

Jared Wilson (ankle), Khyris Tonga (chest) and Brenden Schooler (ankle) were full participants on Wednesday, putting them all in position to return to the lineup after missing the club’s Week 13 victory over the New York Giants.

Terrell Jennings, who was knocked out of that game with a concussion, missed the first two practices of the week and is expected to be sidelined for Sunday’s matchup with the Buffalo Bills.

Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson, as a result, are the club’s only remaining options.

D’Ernest Johnson has already been elevated to the from the practice squad on three separate occasions — making him ineligible to play unless he is promoted to the active roster. Craig Reynolds, who recently joined the organization, was placed on practice squad injured reserve on Wednesday. Jashaun Corbin, who returned from practice squad injured reserve in the same transaction, has played a grand total of 15 snaps in the NFL.

New England just doesn’t have any other options…

Stevenson and Henderson have occupied 92.52% of total snaps at the position in 2025, which includes a three-game absence from the former that caused some serious shuffling at the position involving the likes of Jennings, Johnson and Antonio Gibson.

The Patriots are clearly confident leaning on that duo, but they can’t enter the biggest game of their season with just two running backs on the active roster. Johnson and Corbin are the only options to join them, with the former being the better candidate.

Tyson is projected as a first-round pick with the potential to be the first wide receiver off the board, pacing receivers according to three of ESPN’s four analysts in position rankings posted on Nov. 25.

Despite missing 3.5 games this season, the redshirt junior ranks top five among Big 12 receivers in catches (61, fourth) and touchdown receptions (eight, T-5). He is 12th in yards with 711.

Injuries, such as a hamstring strain he suffered on Oct. 18 against Texas Tech and another apparent lower-body injury in the Territorial Cup, prevented him from having the season he envisioned.

NFL teams evaluating Tyson will also remember the collarbone injury that caused him to miss the 2024 postseason, as well as the knee issues that kept him off the field for most of the 2023 season.

Prior to the collarbone injury, Tyson was leading all of college football in receiving yards for the back half of the regular season (729) and had built a close connection with quarterback Sam Leavitt.

The big key for him entering the 2025 season was to cut down on drops after he had seven in 2024 and had five as a freshman in 2022 (no catches on four targets in 2023 when he battled injuries). He did so successfully with just one drop this season.

Tyson has also bulked up to NFL size over his three years at ASU, growing 1 inch to 6-foot-2 and getting up to 200 pounds after arriving to the program at 185 pounds.

But when the 44-year-old quarterback answered a call from Indianapolis Colts head coach Shane Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard on Sunday night, he realized that wasn’t what their challenge would most require.

A quarterback who knew the playbook? Rivers spent nine years with Steichen as members of the Chargers then a 10th and final NFL season with Ballard and the Colts in 2020. Have a sense of the roster? Rivers said at his (re-)introductory media conference Wednesday that he's rejoining 14 players who he played alongside with the 2020 Colts, including offensive starters in running back Jonathan Taylor, receiver Michael Pittman Jr. and tight end Mo Alie-Cox.

So when Steichen and Ballard asked, “Hey, what do you think?” Rivers couldn’t help but be interested. They told him to sleep on the decision, and he awoke Monday more adamant.

A flight to Indianapolis and a throwing session helped seal the deal. By Tuesday, from his hotel room, Steichen said Rivers told Colts brass: “Dadgummit, let’s freaking go.” Wednesday morning, the Colts announced they had signed Rivers to the practice squad.

“I'm not here to stinking save the year or be a hero by any means,” Rivers said. “We got to stinking run the crap out of the football and play defense and do all those things. So if that comes to be, and I'm the one that's out there, I'm not here to try to save the day. I'm going to know where I'm limited. And as we go, it will get better, if that's the route we end up going.

“I ain't never ran away from anybody anyway. People say, ‘Well, they're going to know you're going to be right there.’ And it's like, ‘Well, they knew that for 16, 17 years.’”

The Colts’ decision to unretire Rivers five years after his last NFL action is atypical. But so, too, was their predicament.

Advertisement

Starting quarterback Daniel Jones, who had led the Colts to a surprise 8-2 start, went from declining play due to a broken left fibula to injured reserve with a right torn Achilles. The quarterback Jones beat out in the preseason, 2023 fourth overall draft pick Anthony Richardson Sr., has yet to be cleared by doctors after sustaining an orbital fracture in a freak accident warming up for an October game. Sixth-round rookie quarterback Riley Leonard relieved Jones last Sunday — but began to realize on the plane Sunday and into Monday that he’d hurt his knee.

Leonard was able to practice Wednesday but has not yet been guaranteed his availability for a Sunday matchup vs. the 10-3 Seattle Seahawks.

And the Colts do not appear to have much confidence in journeyman Brett Rypien, also under contract.

So what does a team with three injured quarterbacks and a playoff berth slipping but not yet out of reach do?

Remember, this is the same franchise that plucked former offensive lineman Jeff Saturday off the ESPN airwaves to serve as its interim head coach in 2022, when Frank Reich was fired.

Longtime Colts members knew better than to be surprised.

“I’ve learned over the years to expect the unexpected,” linebacker Zaire Franklin, an eight-year Colt, said. “Unusual circumstances called for unusual answers. Thankful that we got a guy who knows the system, that knows the building, that knows the guy [and] is able to step in and help us right away.

“It is a crazy situation.”

Rivers and Leonard may be 22 years apart — but Colts’ QB room isn’t as random as you think

It would be fair for Leonard to have questions about the Colts bringing in a 44-year-old who hasn’t played in five years to challenge him for Sunday’s starting job.

In relief of Jones on Sunday, Leonard completed 62.1% (18 of 29) of passes for 145 yards and an interception. He rushed twice for 5 yards and a touchdown.

Leonard is a Day 3 draft pick with a banged-up knee who is “learning this business and I don’t have an opinion on it,” he said diplomatically of the signing. But in a vacuum, it should be reasonable to ask: What can a 44-year-old even do against a frenetic Seahawks front featuring the likes of Leonard Williams and DeMarcus Lawrence? Does this guy really want to do this?

Advertisement

It turns out, Leonard has reason to know better: The 23-year-old worked out with the 44-year-old then-high school coach through the spring in their shared Alabama town of Fairhope.

So Leonard knows that Rivers knows the scheme because it was Rivers he texted when the Colts drafted him, and Rivers whose house he then drove to to review the Colts’ playbook together. Leonard knows Rivers can throw after the two battled in net target throws in the spring. And Leonard knows Rivers is as competitive as he’s seen because when they raced in sprints or throwing on the run, Leonard would hear about it hours later.

“If I got him that day in particular, he’d send me a voice memo at 11 p.m. at night complaining on how I cheated and how I picked an unfair drill,” Leonard said Wednesday. “So yeah, I knew he still had [the drive]. But it is crazy.

“It is as crazy to me as it is anybody.”

Rivers rejoins the Colts five years after his last action in a 17-year career. Rivers won 134 of 240 career regular-season games, completing 64.9% of passes for 63,440 yards, 421 touchdowns and 209 interceptions.

His last NFL action came with the Colts in 2020, after 16 years with the Chargers. Rivers completed 68% of pass attempts for 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions as the Colts advanced to the playoffs.

He didn’t sit around hoping this opportunity would come again.

“Certainly I wasn’t really hanging onto any hope [of] playing again,” Rivers said. “I kind of thought that ship had sailed. But something about it excited me. And it’s kind of one of those deals that a door opens and you can either walk through it and find out if you can do it, or run from it.

Advertisement

“I know there’s risk involved obviously or what may or may not happen. But the only way to find out is going for it. And I felt almost like it was a gift and another opportunity to play and cut it loose with the guys in the game you love to play and the dream you got to live. You may get some bonus time. So I really kept it as simple as that in my mind. And here I stand.”

Do Colts have a chance to make noise with Rivers?

Playing shape and pocket movement will be the biggest questions for Rivers, even if mobility wasn’t the top trait on which his NFL success long hinged.

Mastering the game plan, by all accounts, does not seem to be a concern.

Not only did Rivers play in this system dating back to his Chargers tenure, including four years with Steichen as quarterbacks coach and then interim offensive coordinator — but also Rivers has coached his son Gunnar’s high school team this year with the same playbook. He and Steichen have reviewed concepts and how they were received throughout the season. The mental catchup, Steichen and Rivers feel, is doable.

“I told Gunnar last night, I gave him a play off the call sheet and he was like, ‘Dang, because we ran that play two weeks ago in the semifinal game,’” Rivers said. “You know what I mean? So that part's cool …

“It’s been a whirlwind of 48 hours, I’ll say. But each moment that goes by, I feel more and more confident.”

Will confidence be sufficient? Rivers is not the first player to return after a period of time away, even if the circumstances have varied. The Browns went to the playoffs during the 2023 season after signing Joe Flacco off the couch in December — but Flacco had spent 11 months away from the game, not 59. Some players have suffered injuries after sudden returns, including safety Eric Weddle tearing a pec in the 2021 season’s Super Bowl with the Los Angeles Rams and Darren Waller injuring his pec earlier this season (Waller has returned from injured reserve).

Rivers said he and his family are “a little scared, a little nervous.” But beyond the doubt, he believes football comes with injury risk at any age or stage. The Colts don’t need to look far to remember.

“You never hope something like that or expect something like that to happen,” Rivers said. “But shoot, something like that happens, I got a long time to recover, so that’s for sure.”

The Colts, meanwhile, feel time is ticking on the playoff window they demonstrated belief in after a trade-deadline acquisition of cornerback Sauce Gardner. Indianapolis doesn’t want to lose out on a wide-open AFC in a year when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs are set to break their seven-year streak of not just playoff berths but AFC championship berths.

Any quarterback who can help Indianapolis chase that goal is welcome, beginning with contests against the top two scoring defenses in the Seahawks (17.4 points per game) and Houston Texans (16.0)

The Colts’ playoff hopes could hinge on Rivers’ ability.

After an 8-2 start that featured wins over current playoff contenders in the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Chargers, three straight losses have followed.

Losing to the Jaguars last week knocked the Colts out of the playoff picture, their 8-5 record now eighth place in the AFC and third in the AFC South beneath the 9-4 Jaguars and 8-5 Texans (the Texans beat the Colts, giving them the tiebreaker).

The Colts currently have a 26% chance to make the playoffs, per Next Gen Stats. If they beat the Seahawks this weekend, that chance jumps to 50%, per Next Gen Stat’s model.

With that upside, Rivers wants to make a bet on his health and is willing to renounce his 2026 Pro Hall of Fame semifinalist status, his candidacy consideration delayed another five years if he plays.

He can spend time doubting his ability. Or he could take a chance.

“The easiest way to eliminate all the things that can go bad is to stay home,” Rivers said. “And the only way to find out, ‘Can you still do it?’ is to go try.

“There’s something about being back in this building that feels right. And I’m just thankful.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JOEi7.70RAiGt3FORvHG0w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2025-12/ee38b257-1951-4960-8ac0-fc9d46742268,N,,2025-12-11 18:02:59.780097

Otherwise, medical professionals are “at a disadvantage.” “They don’t have the five years of studying the body.","The injury was so gruesome that the only acceptable way to watch it was through your fingers.

Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels, dragged to the grass by a Seattle Seahawks defender on a running play last month, tried to break his fall with his left hand but ended up bending his elbow in a manner it shouldn’t be bent. Writhing in pain, he lay on his back, grimacing.

Fans in the stadium were stunned, not knowing whether their star might be out for the foreseeable future.

Countless fantasy football team owners who had Daniels on their teams had their own concern: how much time he’d miss and how it would affect their seasons.

Pulling up social media, they turned to the likes of Jeff Mueller.

Mueller is among a growing number of medical professionals who have found an audience in NFL fans, fantasy football players and sports bettors, all of whom seek information about players’ availability before official announcements are made.

Within minutes after an athlete goes down, the doctors post across Instagram, X, YouTube and TikTok their projected injury diagnoses and how many games they envision the player to miss. Later, throughout the week, they give updates on the player's game availability. What they say may either calm nerves or lead to utter panic.

“That desire for injury information has increased over the years because fantasy football has grown with multiple avenues of playing with redraft, dynasty, best ball, guillotine and various other leagues,” Mueller said. “People crave instant information and intel on topics such as injuries because it can have a big impact on their own leagues, betting, odds and other possible impacts even though we often get factual information several days later.”

Mueller is a physical therapist with more than a decade of experience at a sports medicine clinic. His background — and that of seemingly every other medical professional analyzing sports injuries on social media today — has come into question when a diagnosis is made. Are they actually qualified to provide accurate calls without X-rays or examining players in person?

NBC News spoke with six medical professionals with roles from orthopedic surgeon to physical therapist.

Like all content creators, the doctors can monetize injury analysis by driving traffic to their platforms. The larger the following, the higher the chance of financial gain. Some have under 10,000 followers, while others are in the hundreds of thousands across platforms.

But all treat patients first and look at NFL injuries second.

“This is my side hustle. This isn’t my full-time job,” said Tom Christ, a physical therapist outside Philadelphia. “So if I’m in the clinic and we get some kind of [NFL] news breaking, there’s a good chance I’m not looking at my phone for three straight hours when I’m working.”

Christ estimates he spends 10 to 15 hours per week on content creation, not including watching games. He says his game setup is fairly bare-bones: He watches NFL RedZone and takes in as many replays as possible if a player goes down.

“When an injury happens, I’ll record it on my phone and then crop it so you don’t see my walls,” he joked.

Dr. Jesse Morse’s routine is a bit more nuanced. A physician in family and sports medicine who specializes in injuries and musculoskeletal pain, he runs a clinic in Florida that focuses on regenerative medicine. On an NFL Sunday, he also watches RedZone but has a team of two to five people “that will be spotters for me” and alert him of any injury. They then make sure he has video of all the angles and an updated injury history of the player to best assess the situation.

Morse, who spends roughly 20 to 30 hours per week during the season analyzing football injuries, says his background and expertise allow him to have a strong indication of what occurred and the timetable for a player to return “within probably 20 seconds.” His aim is to have a full breakdown online in 10 minutes.

He’s quick to point out that not all injuries are created equal and that factors like previous health situations could make a diagnosis more difficult. Severity is also crucial.

Take Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, for example, who was sidelined after he was tackled by a Jacksonville Jaguars defensive lineman in Week 2.

The video of how he got hurt wasn’t immediately clear, leading Morse to ponder a multitude of questions: “Was he walking [after getting hurt]? Was he in a scooter? Which foot was it? How did it happen? Was it a contact? Was it noncontact? Does he have an injury history of this specific injury or this area of the body? Then from there, you narrow it down to the different injuries you can have for that area.”

Initially, Morse wrote that it was a “left toe injury” that was a “turf toe vs. toe fracture vs. toe dislocation.” It ended up being the former. Morse then said he was “expecting Joe Burrow to miss at the minimum four weeks but [the injury could be] potentially season-ending.” After Burrow had surgery, Morse wrote that “there’s a small chance he’s able to return in December.”

Burrow got back on the field against the Baltimore Ravens on Nov. 27.

While fans crave instant information, the doctors say they aim to not rush out a diagnosis.

“You don’t want to just get out there as fast as possible and be wrong,” Christ said. “You want to be known for being accurate. So I would personally rather take my time and really evaluate the video and then put out my thoughts.’”

Dr. Nithin Natwa, a board-certified sports physician who now works at an urgent care facility in Chicago, said specific language is key. It’s best for professionals to never say a player has an exact injury or will be out a certain amount of time because they are ultimately giving their best guesses.

“It’s really important to be measured in the language that you use and just kind of say, ‘These are possible outcomes, and it seems like it’s more likely it’s this one, but without having imaging results or physical exam, it could definitely be one of these less severe cases.’ I try to give all the options out there.”

Though they work to be as precise as possible, some other medical professionals say they aren’t sure that the standard has been met.

Stephania Bell is considered a pioneer in the field. Bell, ESPN’s senior writer and injury analyst, joined ESPN in the fall of 2007 after more than 17 years as a physical therapist and orthopedic clinical specialist. At that time, very few (if any) medical professionals wrote or spoke on television about sports injuries.

She initially found inspiration from members of her fantasy league.

“The guys I played fantasy football with knew (I treated athletes) and were asking me questions all the time, and that’s how I started to realize that the information was probably marketable,” she said. “And I saw that fantasy football was growing.”

Today, she is considered one of the most trusted injury experts in sports media, co-hosting the popular “Fantasy Focus Football” podcast and making regular television appearances. The one place you won’t find her, however, is on social media giving instant prognostications about injuries.

Because she doesn’t have access to any imaging and isn’t examining a player in person, she prefers to wait until a team releases an official update or one of ESPN’s many “insiders” provides the latest.

Being right matters more to her than being first.

“The medical folks who are actually covering the teams don’t love it that people are ripping off these diagnoses,” she said. “They’re frustrated because they’re like, ‘I can tell you how much more goes into it with being there, and we still don’t always know.’ So I understand there’s an appetite for quick information, but for me, in my professional lifetime, that’s just not where I’m gonna live.”

Dr. Christopher Cooke took it a step further. Cooke, an orthopedic surgeon outside Detroit who was a team doctor with the Tigers and a consultant for the Red Wings, said fans must be skeptical about what they see online.

“There’s a lot of armchair doctor people out there who make comments,” he said. “Not to sound too boisterous, I don’t think the majority of them really know what’s going on.”

Cooke was in a five-year orthopedic surgery residency followed by a one-year sports medicine fellowship at Kerlan Jobe Medical Center in Los Angeles. It was there that ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction — or Tommy John surgery — was first conducted.

Cooke said experience is needed to be able to properly diagnose an injury. Otherwise, medical professionals are “at a disadvantage.”

“They don’t have the five years of studying the body. They don’t have the hands-on experience. They’ve never held an ACL in their hand as they reconstructed it. It’s someone who certainly could fit a role, but they’re not an expert in the area.”

“There’s only a finite amount of people I really trust what they say,” he said later. “And oftentimes these people online don’t have the training to make the right comments, but they have enough knowledge to just spout out something. Oftentimes, in my opinion, they’re very, very wrong.”

Though most take extra caution when they make diagnoses, specifically saying a certain injury or timetable is “possible” or “likely,” there are times when the medical professionals miss the mark.

After Arizona Cardinals running back Trey Benson injured a knee on Sept. 25, Natwa went on Instagram and said he should return in five to seven weeks. Instead, two months later, the team announced he wouldn’t be back at all this season.

Dr. Tarek Souryal is an orthopedic surgeon who was a longtime team doctor for the Dallas Mavericks. While he agreed with Cooke that some online doctors may not have the proper credentials — and urged fans to be wary of diagnoses off video alone — they are knowledgeable enough for what they are being asked to give out.

“If I was using purely the video to perform surgery on Kobe Bryant, that would be extraordinarily dangerous and frankly malpractice,” Souryal said. “However, if I’m looking at a video and I’m saying, ‘I think he ruptured his Achilles tendon, that’s what the video tape looks like it shows, and I wouldn’t count on him being back in the next four to six months,’ I don’t think there’s any harm in making that kind of speculation.”

Colts quarterback Daniel Jones was arguably the biggest surprise early on in the NFL season. Jones, once the longtime New York Giants signal-caller, led Indianapolis to an 8-2 start and drew early MVP buzz. But injuries in recent weeks led to a decline in his play, and things took a turn for the worse Sunday: He sustained a season-ending Achilles injury.

Shortly after the game, Natwa took to Instagram for a full video breakdown.

“We see him take a false step back,” he says, pointing to a slo-mo replay. “It’s where you start a step back and your ankle is put in an extreme acute angle, really loading the Achilles. As you’re pushing off, the Achilles has an increased risk of rupturing.”

Natwa said he doesn’t just want to give an injury label and a timetable. His goal is to educate with longer videos, even though it may take more work. He spends around 36 hours a week on football injury analysis.

It has led to some minor fame, though not in his own house.

“Some guy saw me in a coffee shop where we live, and he recognized me,” he said. “He was like, ‘Oh, man, you’re the fantasy doc.’ And [my wife was] like, ‘Oh, my God, is this that fantasy football thing that no one watches?’ And the guy at the coffee shop was like, ‘No, no. We all watch it. We watch his videos.’ She was so annoyed.”

Evan Jeffries, a physical therapist based in San Diego who breaks down injuries in all sports, not just football, has a bit more sympathy from his family.

“My kids think it’s funny. They love it,” he said. “They think I’m famous, and I tell them I’m definitely not famous.”

For Morse — who says he earns $25,000 to $50,000 per year on average analyzing football injuries — money isn’t why he does it.

“I’m a fantasy fan first, then I happen to be a doctor, and then I happen to be a specialist in sports medicine. I’m just crazy passionate about it. If you’re not, you don’t have the time to do this,” he said. “If you were to call up any random sports medicine doctor [or] orthopedic surgeon and say, ‘Hey, what happened to Jayden Daniels yesterday?’ There’s going to be like, ‘What the hell are you talking about?’”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/20251010NBCNewsfantasy-footballfinalv3-7fe1a5.png",N,,2025-12-11 18:03:03.585887

""If I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing this,"" Burrow told reporters Wednesday. ""I have been through a lot. If it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That is the mindset I am trying to bring to the table.""

Burrow started the first two games of the season for Cincinnati, but suffered a toe injury in Week 2 that kept him out until he was able to make his return against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 13.

The Bengals own a 3-1 record with Burrow under center this year, but their playoff hopes are rapidly fading largely due to a 1-8 mark in the nine games he missed.

If Cincinnati is ultimately eliminated from postseason contention, it would mark the third consecutive year that the team misses the playoffs. The Bengals' recent struggles are especially disappointing given their Super Bowl appearance during the 2021 season and AFC Championship Game appearance the following year.

As for Burrow, the two-time Pro Bowler has still been effective despite his limited playing time this season. He's completed 59.3 percent of his throws for 734 yards and eight touchdowns compared to a pair of interceptions.

Still, 2025 marked the third season that Burrow suffered a significant injury in his NFL career. His rookie year came to an end due to a torn ACL and his 2023 campaign was cut short by a season-ending wrist injury.","https://gsp-image-cdn.wmsports.io/cms/prod/bleacher-report/ap_images/0456d76f0df94beb912bbc74490e16f0/Bengals_Bills_Football_25125_4351x2448_(0,147).jpg?w=3800&h=2000",N,,2025-12-11 15:03:52.128775

Let’s start with the good: Rookie left guard Jared Wilson was a full participant in Wednesday’s practice after sitting out Week 13 due to an ankle injury. Wilson, who started at left guard for 11 of the first 12 games, seemingly is on track to return for this Sunday’s home game against the Buffalo Bills.

However, veteran Ben Brown played well in place of Wilson against the Giants, so the Patriots could start him against Buffalo. We’ll just have to wait and see.

Now for the bad news: Left tackle Vederian Lowe was limited in Wednesday’s practice due to an abdominal injury. The severity of the injury remains unclear, but the Patriots, who’ll be without rookie Will Campbell for at least the next three weeks, would be in dire straits at left tackle if Lowe were forced to miss time.

You could make the case that Washington's two primary needs are edge rusher and wide receiver. Due to their terrible season, the Commanders currently sit at No. 6 in the 2026 NFL draft order, with the potential to rise in the coming weeks. Washington should be in a position to land one of the draft's top prospects.

Much of the Commanders' draft strategy will be impacted by what they do in free agency. Regardless, it's a good bet that Washington looks for a pass rusher or a wide receiver with its first pick. One of the debates facing the Commanders is should they trade down if they land a top-five pick? They are without second and fourth-round picks in the upcoming draft due to the Laremy Tunsil trade.

Carnell Tate (Ohio State) and Jordyn Tyson (Arizona State) are considered the top receiver prospects in 2026. Both should land somewhere inside the top 15. Louisville wide receiver Chris Bell is another first-round prospect. Unfortunately, his first-round status could be in jeopardy. ESPN's Adam Schefter revealed on Wednesday that Bell suffered a torn ACL in Louisville's November 22 game against SMU.

While Washington wouldn't have been a potential pick for the Commanders inside the top five, he would've been an ideal candidate if there was a trade down. At 6-foot-2, 220 pounds, Bell is a bigger, younger version of current Washington receiver Deebo Samuel. In addition to his size, power and ability to create yards after the catch, Bell has 4.4 speed. Bell also excels in contested-catch situations.

It's an unfortunate injury for Bell. However, it doesn't necessarily mean he'll fall far. Washington guard Sam Cosmi tore his ACL in late January and was back in the lineup in October. So, while all injuries are different, Bell could be back for Week 1 of his rookie season.","https://commanderswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/11/SCMD/87712277007-usatsi-27146491.jpg?crop=5413,3046,x0,y136&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-11 15:04:06.202448

They held the No. 1 seed in the NFC before the loss but fell all the way to the No. 7 seed.

Bears wideout Rome Odunze was forced to miss the game after suffering a foot injury.

The second-year receiver was quickly becoming the No. 1 target for Chicago, and the playmaker Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson could rely on, on the perimeter. Odunze had accumulated a team-high 661 receiving yards before his injury. His absence is a significant blow to the offense.

Like many teams around the NFL, Chicago is dealing with many injuries across its roster.

With Chicago appearing poised to be a contender in the NFC, they'll need Odunze to return to full health soon for the playoff push over the final four weeks and his status remains one of the more important ones to monitor.

Here's the latest on the Bears' second-year wide receiver:

When will Rome Odunze return?

Odunze was ruled out for Week 14 with a foot injury but his status for Week 15 remains up in the air.

The second-year receiver was listed as limited in the Bears' walkthrough practice on Wednesday, Dec. 10. The Bears host the Cleveland Browns in Week 15.

It's encouraging news after Odunze failed to practice in any capacity before Week 14.

The Bears did not place Odunze on injured reserve (IR), which would have required at least four games missed. This suggests that if the injury had been long-term, the team would likely have placed him on IR. Instead, it would make sense for Odunze to return soon.

Odunze is the Bears’ leading receiver in 2025 with 661 yards on 44 catches. He has six touchdowns.

He suffered a stress fracture in his foot that left him week-to-week, per the NFL Network. However, Odunze's limited practice participation to start Week 15 indicates he has a chance to return Sunday against Cleveland. His practice status on Thursday and Friday will be key to his potential return to action after missing just one game.

Bears WR depth chart

Here's a look at who the Bears will have at WR if Odunze remains sidelined:

Rome Odunze (injured)

DJ Moore

Luther Burden

Olamide Zaccheaus

Devin Duvernay

Jahdae Walker

With Odunze sidelined in Week 14, it was expected that veteran DJ Moore would see increased volume, but he managed just one catch on three targets for -4 yards. Rookie second-rounder Luther Burden made the most of his expanded role, leading the team in catches and yards in Week 14. The veteran Zaccheaus provides solid play from the slot receiver position but isn't much of a red zone threat.

The Bengals’ star quarterback had some curious comments during a press conference Wednesday that many thought were alarming.

“If I want to keep doing this, then what am I trying to do with myself?” Burrow told reporters. “And I have to have fun doing it. You know, if it’s not fun, then what am I doing it for? So, that’s the mindset.”

Burrow just returned from a severe Grade 3 turf toe injury, missing a majority of the season after suffering the injury in Week 2.

Since returning, Burrow has led the Bengals to a win over the Ravens and a high-scoring loss in Buffalo to the Bills that all but ended Cincinnati’s playoff hopes.

“Do I have fun playing?” Burrow asked while at the press conference. “I mean, how much? Winning’s always fun, but in general, was it as fun as before? No, I wouldn’t say it was that way.”

The Bengals currently have the No. 28-ranked offensive line according to Pro Football Focus, and he’s being pressured on 23.3 percent of his dropbacks, among the worst figures in the NFL

Burrow has suffered numerous injuries in his NFL career as he’s tried to put the Bengals on his back, leading them to a Super Bowl loss to the Rams in 2022.

This will now likely be the third straight season the Bengals have missed the playoffs.

Burrow was asked if there was a turning point that made him enjoy the game less.

“The changing point? I’m not sure there was a singular moment or time,” Burrow said. “Reflection — reflection on a lot of things that I’ve done and been through in my career, I think. And I’ve been through more than most. Certainly not easy on the brain or body, so just trying to have fun doing it again.”

Burrow ominously added, “Ummm, there’s just a lot of things going on right now — football-related, personally, all the above.”

Burrow was distressed last season after a break-in at his home, in which the only person at his residence was model Olivia Ponton.

The two have since been spotted together are are believed to be dating.

On the field, Burrow is among the most hit quarterbacks in the NFL on a yearly basis.

There were rumblings that the Bengals’ superstar signal caller had reservations about playing in Cincinnati while he was starring at LSU.

Some implored the Heisman trophy winner to “pull an Eli Manning” and tell the Bengals to trade the pick ahead of the draft.

Burrow wound up going to the Bengals, where he got abused behind one of the league’s worst offensive lines in 2020, eventually resulting in him tearing his ACL as a rookie.

Some have speculated that these comments could be a precursor to an early retirement or a trade demand.

It certainly is possible that his frustration is with the team, which seemingly can’t solve offensive line issues and continues to botch contract negotiations with players, as the Bengals’ owners, the Brown family, are known as one of the cheapest in the NFL.

Burrow threw four touchdown passes against Buffalo, but also tossed two critical interceptions in the snow that doomed Cincinnati.

CeeDee Lamb injury update Lamb remains in the NFL's concussion protocol as of Wednesday, Dec. 10.
Lamb was quickly ruled out with a concussion after hitting his head on the turf in the Cowboys' Week 14 ""Thursday Night Football"" game in Detroit.
What is the NFL's concussion protocol?
The NFL's concussion protocol is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury.","The Dallas Cowboys (6-6-1) saw their playoff hopes dwindle after losing in Week 14.

Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb was injured in the loss and entered the NFL's concussion protocol.

Dallas hosts the Minnesota Vikings (5-8) on ""Sunday Night Football"" in Week 15. The question remaining is whether the star wide receiver will be available as the Cowboys cling to their playoff hopes.

He logged a limited practice Wednesday to begin the week but still has yet to clear the protocol.

Dallas is outside of the playoff picture and has little room for error over the final four games. The Cowboys are battling to stay in the NFC East race and fans are hopeful their All-Pro wide receiver will be available this week.

Here's the latest on Lamb.

CeeDee Lamb injury update

Lamb remains in the NFL's concussion protocol as of Wednesday, Dec. 10. It is unclear how much time he might miss, if any.

Lamb was quickly ruled out with a concussion after hitting his head on the turf in the Cowboys' Week 14 ""Thursday Night Football"" game in Detroit.

On Wednesday, head coach Brian Schottenheimer provided an update on Lamb.

“CeeDee is progressing nicely through the process, the protocol,” Schottenheimer said. “He has two more things he’s gotta get done, but I feel good about that.”

Lamb will have two more chances to practice fully this week before the Cowboys likely tag him with a designation ahead of Sunday's game against the Vikings.

It has typically been a challenge for players to return the following week after suffering a concussion, but Lamb is benefiting from the extended rest because Dallas played last Thursday. He appears to be trending towards playing this week.

What is the NFL's concussion protocol?

The NFL's concussion protocol is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury. It's a five-step process that a player must complete before they can return to play. Those steps are, as defined by the NFL:

Symptom-limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football-specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Full football activity/clearance

Before a player enters the protocol, they are evaluated on the sideline. The tests are conducted by the team's physician and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant. The evaluation includes observing any ""no-go"" symptoms, which are things like loss of consciousness, confusion, amnesia, and more, in addition to a history of concussions, other signs/symptoms, and video review.

At that point, a neurological exam is conducted and the player is escorted to the locker room if the sideline evaluation leaves any doubt.

Cowboys WR depth chart

Here's a look at the Cowboys' WR depth chart:

CeeDee Lamb (injured)

George Pickens

Ryan Flournoy

KaVontae Turpin

Jonathan Mingo

Dallas played three games this season without Lamb after he suffered a high ankle sprain in Week 4. The star missed Weeks 4-6, and Pickens emerged as a significant weapon.

Flournoy and Turpin have each been effective in their roles, while Mingo is a depth piece. Flournoy has flashed at times and even produced a massive 115 yards on nine catches in Week 14 after Lamb exited the game.

Jalen Tolbert has fallen out of the rotation and was a healthy inactive for ""Thursday Night Football"" in Detroit last week.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/10/USAT/87708798007-2250055732.jpg?crop=1696,954,x711,y520&width=1696&height=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-11 13:05:01.707276

McMillan sustained a neck injury in the second game of the preseason and has been on injured reserve since the start of the regular season.
In his limited playing time in 2025, Evans has secured 14 receptions for 140 yards and one touchdown.","When the Tampa Bay Buccaneers used a first-round pick to add Ohio State wide receiver Emeka Egbuka to an already-loaded position in April, visions of an unstoppable four-wide of the newcomer, 2024 rookie breakout Jalen McMillan and franchise stars Mike Evans and Chris Godwin were immediately generated. Unfortunately, a long string of injuries to the Buccaneers' receiving corps have kept that vision from being realized in 2025.

Until now.

On Wednesday, the Buccaneers activated Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan from injured reserve, making both available to play on Thursday night against the Atlanta Falcons. Evans and McMillan are both questionable on the injury report for the game, but if they suit up it will mark the first time that those two, Godwin and Egbuka are active for the same game.

To make room on the 53-man roster for the return of Evans and McMillan, the Buccaneers waived defensive lineman C.J. Brewer and wide receiver Ryan Miller.

Evans, who is the Buccaneers' all-time leader in virtually every receiving category, is back after missing six games due to a fractured collarbone sustained in Detroit in Week Seven. He also missed three games earlier in the season with a hamstring strain, which happened to coincide exactly with Godwin's return to action after sitting out the first three contests. Godwin also missed five midseason games with a fibula injury. McMillan sustained a neck injury in the second game of the preseason and has been on injured reserve since the start of the regular season.

In his limited playing time in 2025, Evans has secured 14 receptions for 140 yards and one touchdown. His career totals include 850 receptions for 12,824 yards and 106 touchdowns and he is the first player in NFL history to surpass 1,000 receiving yards in each of his first 11 seasons. Evans ranks 10th in NFL history in touchdown receptions and has made six Pro Bowls, including the last two.

McMillan was a third-round pick out of Washington in 2024 and after a slow start to his rookie campaign due to injuries he caught fire down the stretch, finishing with 37 catches for 461 yards. Most of that came during the last five weeks, when he surpassed 50 receiving yards in every game and led all NFL players in that span with seven touchdown receptions.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/buccaneers/pgwg4cziqwhmbptaux3d,N,,2025-12-11 14:01:32.662236

,,2025-12-11 03:27:39+00:00,CBS Sports,How recent injury changed Joe Burrow's career outlook: 'I've been through a lot',Bryan DeArdo,,,,,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/bengals-quarterback-joe-burrow-injury-career-outlook/,"Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow turned 29 on Wednesday, but he was not in a celebratory mood.
You know, I've been through a lot, and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for?
During the Bengals' tenth game of the 2023 season, Burrow sustained a wrist injury that required season-ending surgery.
""It's certainly something you have to think about,"" Burrow said when asked about risk-reward element of playing through injury.
""It's just a reflection on a lot of things that I've done and been through in my career,"" he said.","Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow turned 29 on Wednesday, but he was not in a celebratory mood. He acknowledged that ""there's just a lot of things going on right now"" during a subdued press conference that also included him sharing new perspective following his most recent injury.

""It certainly doesn't change my desire to win,"" said Burrow, who is preparing for his third game after missing nine weeks with turf toe. ""You know, if I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it. You know, I've been through a lot, and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That's the mindset I'm trying to bring to the table.""

Burrow, on the heels of a tough road loss to the Buffalo Bills, was asked if it's hard to have fun given his injury and the Bengals' 4-9 record.

""Certainly,"" he said with Sunday's home game with the Baltimore Ravens looming.

When healthy, Burrow has been one of the NFL's best quarterbacks since he entered the league in 2020. But health has largely eluded him to this point in his career.

Pete Prisco

A knee injury sidelined him for the second half of his rookie season. Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl the following year, but he sustained an MCL sprain during Cincinnati's Super Bowl loss to the Los Angeles Rams.

After rehabbing that injury during the offseason, Burrow missed a significant portion of training camp after he had an emergency appendectomy for a ruptured appendix. A year later, Burrow missed a little over a month after injuring his calf during the first day of training camp.

During the Bengals' tenth game of the 2023 season, Burrow sustained a wrist injury that required season-ending surgery. He returned in 2024 and led the NFL with 4,918 yards and 43 touchdowns en route to winning NFL Comeback Player of the Year for a second time.

""It's certainly something you have to think about,"" Burrow said when asked about risk-reward element of playing through injury. ""That's that's life as a professional athlete, no different than basketball and MMA, baseball. It's what we chose. [We] make a lot of sacrifices, and your body is often one of them.""

Given all of his injuries, it's easy to see why Burrow has decided to put more of an emphasis on enjoying himself for as long as he continues playing.

""It's just a reflection on a lot of things that I've done and been through in my career,"" he said. ""I think I've been through more than most and certainly not easy on the brain or the body. So, just trying to have fun doing it.""

Burrow is often compared to Andrew Luck, the former Indianapolis Colts quarterback and No. 1 pick who retired at 29 after injuries had diminished his desire to continue playing. And while Burrow's comments will undoubtedly conjure up more Luck comparisons, he didn't say anything on Wednesday that would suggest that he is planning to hang up his cleats anytime soon.

Burrow, who is under contract through the 2029 season, is likely frustrated with his team's current situation. Burrow underwent a grueling rehabilitation process in order to make it back from his toe injury sooner than most people expected. He was hoping that the Bengals would win enough games without him so they could go on a legitimate playoff run when he did return.

That didn't happen, however, as the Bengals (who were 2-0 at the time of his injury) won just one game during his absence. And while their playoff hopes are still technically alive, that isn't giving Burrow much solace.

""I don't think anybody's really thinking about the playoffs right now,"" he said. ""That's within reach, but it's on our fingertips, so we've got to keep doing what we're doing and try to get better.""

While the majority of the presser was dark, Burrow cracked a smile when asked about the Pokémon box he received from his offensive linemen as a birthday gift. He was specifically asked what exactly is a Pokémon.

""I'll let you research that,"" he said in a rare moment of fun.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/10/a32c829e-107d-4332-9e6a-486b70cdd311/thumbnail/1200x675/0240e54cce9990e43a919daaf5ecb733/burrow14.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 23:58:23.903109

""It's very difficult, but that's the nature of the game,"" Leonard said on Sunday after the game.
That won't change this week, either – even with 44-year-old Philip Rivers joining the Colts' practice squad and being evaluated for his readiness to start on Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks.","Riley Leonard was a full participant in the Colts' Wednesday practice before their Week 15 game against the Seattle Seahawks; the rookie quarterback was cleared to return to practice after sustaining a knee injury on Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

""It feels good,"" Leonard said Wednesday before practice. ""They cleared me for practice, so excited to get back out there, test it out a little bit. But feels really good.""

Leonard made his unofficial NFL debut on Sunday after Daniel Jones left the game in the first quarter with a torn Achilles. Leonard played three full quarters, completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards with an interception and a rushing touchdown in the Colts' 36-19 loss. Another touchdown pass to Michael Pittman Jr. was taken off the board due to an offensive pass interference call.

""It's very difficult, but that's the nature of the game,"" Leonard said on Sunday after the game. ""Obviously, your first thought is to pray for Daniel and hope he's great because that's not how you envision getting snaps, right? I always envision myself working and working and developing into a starter, (a position) that I earned. Whether I earned it or not is kind of irrelevant. Daniel went down; my turn was up. It's super unfortunate to see that, but hopefully everything works out. We'll be praying for him for sure.""

Leonard has operated with uncertainty throughout the entire season. He started out as a third-string rookie who, realistically, wouldn't set foot on the field. Then, when Anthony Richardson Sr. sustained a fractured orbital bone, Leonard was promoted to the backup quarterback behind Jones and became just one play away from seeing game action.

Nothing changed for Leonard at any point in that process, though; he prepared the same way every week, no matter what. That won't change this week, either – even with 44-year-old Philip Rivers joining the Colts' practice squad and being evaluated for his readiness to start on Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks.

Head coach Shane Steichen said Wednesday that they would ""see how the week goes"" for both quarterbacks and make a decision at the end of the week. So, until then, Leonard is only focused on one thing: what he can do for himself.

""As far as I know, I'm going to go out there and give it my best,"" he said. ""I'm just here to play my best, be my best at practice today.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/ledu3nvbgxwq2zvtor5b,N,,2025-12-11 12:07:25.792980

Overall, Herbert added that the status of his hand is in a much better place than it was a week ago.
Perhaps that's because Herbert was out there trying to stiff arm the Eagles defense with that broken left hand.

The results were good.

""Everything was clean for the most part,"" Herbert said. ""It's just getting the swelling down and continuing to get full strength in it and continuing to do as much treatment as I can.""

He later added: ""Just took a couple hits, I think the doctors were making sure they're doing everything they can to just take a look and be as safe as possible.""

Overall, Herbert added that the status of his hand is in a much better place than it was a week ago.

""It's a lot better now. I think it was just sore. I think having played on it, using it and falling on it, too, I think that kind of helped and was some of the reason why it was sore,"" Herbert said. ""I think for the most part, it's gotten a lot better, I feel like my grip strength has gotten better and just being able to use it has gotten better, too.""

As for his performance in primetime, the Chargers quarterback said he could have been sharper after throwing for just 139 yards and committing two turnovers.

According to NFL Next Gen Stats, Herbert was pressured on 68.3 percent of his dropbacks, the sixth-highest percentage in a game over the last 10 seasons among quarterbacks with at least 20 dropbacks.

""I thought it was a really tough day for the offense, especially for me,"" Herbert said. ""I had two turnovers, and I missed a lot of throws and played uncharacteristically, and there's a bunch of plays that I'd love to have back, a few balls that I missed outside.

""I think those are going to happen. It's unfortunate that we didn't play to the expectations that we hold for ourselves, but I thought we did a great job battling all four quarters and in overtime because it looked pretty grim there for a while,"" Herbert continued.

""For us to keep battling and go get the special teams out on the field and get some points, it's obviously not what we want, but to get the win and the defense the way they played, and special teams, it's what was best for us,"" Herbert added.

Perhaps that's because Herbert was out there trying to stiff arm the Eagles defense with that broken left hand.

Herbert smiled Wednesday when asked about the play and said he might have had some regrets about attempting it.

""Yeah, maybe after if it wasn't very effective,"" Herbert said. ""But in the moment, I think that was the best thing I could've done for the team — getting the first down and doing everything I can to be able to get around the edge.

""There's a world where it is effective and maybe I'm staying on my feet and getting more yards. I'm glad everything went well and I'm feeling better because of it,"" Herbert added.

Even so, the Chargers were able to grind out a primetime win against the defending Super Bowl champions and improve to 9-4.

Herbert suggested Wednesday that Monday night's win could be helpful for the Bolts as they get ready for a daunting four-game stretch that includes Sunday's road game in Kansas City.

""I think it's huge because you want to be playing memorable football in December and January, and meaningful games,"" Herbert said. ""Those are the type of games that you need to win, against opponents we have a ton of respect for and are very good.

""For us to be able to battle one out like that helps everyone in the locker room and gives everyone confidence,"" Herbert added. ""Going through games like that, it's only going to help you in the long run.""

According to The Athletic, the Chargers current playoff odds are at 78 percent.

Those odds can jump to 95 percent with a win Sunday in Kansas City.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/chargers/ichtyzhqjazccru6ssvr,N,,2025-12-10 21:58:51.348990

The injury creates uncertainty for Jones, who is heading into free agency.

Before the injury, Jones was headed towards a long-term extension with Indianapolis.

INDIANAPOLIS — Colts starting quarterback Daniel Jones had surgery to repair his torn Achilles tendon.

Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen said the quarterback’s surgery went well.

Jones now faces the uncertainty of heading into free agency with a torn Achilles tendon. Before the injury, Jones was in line to get an extension to be the Colts’ quarterback of the future.

A recovery for an Achilles tendon typically takes nine months to a year, a timetable that could threaten Jones’ ability to start the 2026 season.

If the Colts believe he will be healthy, Jones could be back in Indianapolis. Jones completed 68% of his passes for 3,101 yards, 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions, and he rushed for five touchdowns despite playing more from the pocket than he ever did in New York.

In the process, Jones carved out a critical role in the locker room.

“The work that he puts in and the effort on a day-to-day basis,” Steichen said Monday. “The grind. A team captain for us, just very unfortunate. One of the toughest guys I've ever been around, so just praying for a speedy recovery for him.”

From the sounds of it, Jones’ recovery has already begun, with news that a successful surgery has already taken place.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/PIND/87658464007-2250563329.jpg?crop=5928,3335,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 23:58:30.632743

Pro Bowl left guard Landon Dickerson was sidelined briefly on Monday night against the Los Angeles Chargers due to a calf injury. Despite missing 12 offensive snaps in the overtime battle, Dickerson would have practiced for the Eagles on Wednesday as a limited participant.

The team held a walkthrough on Wednesday, so the injury report is an estimation.

While there's good news regarding Dickerson, All-Pro right tackle Lane Johnson remains sidelined with a foot injury. He would not have practiced on Wednesday. Johnson suffered the injury in the Week 11 win over Detroit. Fred Johnson replaced Lane Johnson against the Lions and has started the last three games.

Defensive tackle Jalen Carter would have been the only other Eagle on the active roster to miss practice on Wednesday. Carter is sidelined with injuries to both shoulders. He did not play on Monday night against the Chargers. The Eagles opened against Los Angeles with a four-man front, anchored by Jordan Davis and Moro Ojomo in the middle at defensive tackle. Byron Young played 32 snaps on Monday night, one week after a season-high 38, to help pick up the slack in Carter's absence.

The Eagles opened long snapper Charley Hughlett's 21-day practice window on Wednesday. Hughlett has not played since the Week 4 win over the Buccaneers due to an abdominal injury. He would have been a full participant. The Eagles waived Hughlett's replacement Cal Adomitis on Tuesday.

Rookie offensive tackle Myles Hinton's 21-day practice window expired, so he will remain on Injured Reserve for the rest of the year with a back injury.

QB Geno Smith, DE Maxx Crosby sidelined for Raiders on Wednesday

All signs point to former Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett returning to Lincoln Financial Field for a start in his homecoming this Sunday afternoon.

The Raiders' quarterback entered Sunday's loss to the Broncos at the start of the fourth quarter after starter Geno Smith exited with a shoulder injury.

In the two full drives led by Pickett, the Raiders scored 10 of their 17 points.

Smith did not practice on Wednesday.

That's not the only injury to monitor for the Raiders.

Starting safety Jeremy Chinn missed Wednesday's practice with a back injury. Chinn posted 11 tackles and a sack against the Broncos on Sunday, playing every snap on defense. The Raiders added Chinn to the injury report last Friday and he was questionable for the Broncos game.

Defensive end Maxx Crosby also missed Wednesday's practice with knee and shoulder injuries. Crosby also played every snap on defense and finished with four tackles and a sack of Broncos quarterback Bo Nix. Crosby did not practice last Thursday or Friday due to the knee injury (the shoulder is a new addition to the injury report). Crosby, like Chinn, was questionable to play against Denver.

The Raiders opened starting left tackle Kolton Miller's practice window on Wednesday. He was limited with an ankle injury that has sidelined him since the end of September.

Sunday will mark the seventh game Daniels has missed because of injury this season.
After dislocating the elbow against the Seattle Seahawks, Daniels missed the ensuing three games but was cleared to return last week.
It was just where we were in the game,"" Quinn said.","ASHBURN, Va. -- Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels won't play Sunday against the New York Giants, coach Dan Quinn said Wednesday.

Daniels was knocked from Sunday's 31-0 loss to the Minnesota Vikings after landing hard on his left elbow, which he had dislocated in Week 9. Quinn said Daniels could have returned to the game, but with the score 17-0 late in the third quarter, the coach decided to insert backup Marcus Mariota.

Quinn said that Daniels aggravated the injury but that further examinations by doctors Monday showed that there was no structural damage or setback. Quinn said there is a chance Daniels will return the following week against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Daniels was participating in individual drills Wednesday during the portion of practice open to the media, and Quinn said they haven't yet considered shutting Daniels down for the season.

""As far as what decisions are ahead, we haven't gone down that road,"" Quinn said. ""He's working fairly hard to get back with the guys.""

Sunday will mark the seventh game Daniels has missed because of injury this season. He left each of his past three games because of an injury. After dislocating the elbow against the Seattle Seahawks, Daniels missed the ensuing three games but was cleared to return last week. That was the first time Daniels and his top three receivers were available in the same game this season since Week 2.

While trying to chase down linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel after a third-quarter interception, Daniels was blocked to the ground. He briefly remained on the ground after the play, then ran off the field and to the bench, showing frustration.

Daniels' second season has been hampered by injuries. He missed two games with a sprained left knee, another with a hamstring issue and then the three because of the initial elbow injury.

Quinn said the decision to keep Daniels from returning against Minnesota was because of the score and not due to any lingering fallout stemming from the Seattle game. Daniels was hurt with 7 minutes, 39 seconds left against the Seahawks with the score 38-7, and Quinn said he regretted not pulling him from an eventual 24-point loss.

""[That game] didn't weigh on me. It was just where we were in the game,"" Quinn said. ""It wasn't going like we wanted, and I thought it was the best call. It wasn't a difficult one that I wrestled with in that spot. I said I was going to make the best decision for him and the team.

""He wasn't happy about it. This is the best decision right now, and I'll continue to do that whether it was him or anybody else in that spot.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1207%2Fr1586376_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 19:59:37.744568

Meanwhile, Kyle Pitts and edge rusher Jalon Walker are questionable after being limited on Wednesday. On a more positive note, corner A.J. Terrell (neck) was a full participant on Wednesday and carries no injury designation.

The Buccaneers are expected to get wideout Mike Evans back after missing the bulk of the year due to a collarbone injury he suffered in Week 7.

Both Evans and Jalen McMillan have also been activated off injured reserve.

Outside of that, everyone was accounted for as defensive end Joey Bosa (hamstring, wrist), linebacker Terrel Bernard (elbow), offensive lineman Spencer Brown (shoulder), and Josh Palmer (ankle) were limited.

Las Vegas Raiders at Philadelphia Eagles (-11.5)

Geno Smith is dealing with a shoulder injury and is unlikely to play on Sunday. The veteran did not practice on Wednesday, which puts Kenny Pickett in line to start in Week 15. Las Vegas also designated offensive tackle Kolton Miller to return from injured reserve.

Los Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (-4.5)

The Chiefs held out receiver Hollywood Brown (personal), offensive lineman Wanya Morris (knee), and offensive tackle Jawaan Taylor (triceps, knee) from practice to begin the week. Corner Trent McDuffie (knee) was limited.

New York Jets at Jacksonville Jaguars (-12.5)

The Jets were missing 10 players on Wednesday, which included quarterback Justin Fields (knee) and Tyrod Taylor (groin). If neither can play, that would throw Brady Cook in as the starter in all likelihood. Running back Breece Hall (knee), edge rusher Jermaine Johnson II (rest), linebacker Kiko Mauigoa (neck), defensive lineman Harrison Phillips, tight end Stone Smartt (concussion), tight end Mason Taylor (neck), corner Azareye'h Thomas (shoulder), and linebacker Quincy Williams (hand) were also held out.

Jacksonville listed quarterback Trevor Lawrence as a limited participant in practice on Wednesday due to an ankle injury. Receiver Parker Washington (hip), tight end Quintin Morris (ankle), offensive lineman Ezra Cleveland (shoulder), offensive lineman Walker Little (concussion), safety Andrew Wingard (concussion), and defensive lineman B.J. Green II (knee) were also limited.

Washington Commanders at New York Giants (-2.5)

Commanders head coach Dan Quinn announced Wednesday that Jayden Daniels re-aggravated his left elbow injury against the Vikings and will be held out for Week 15. Marcus Mariota will start. Meanwhile, defensive end Drake Jackson (groin, knee), corner Jonathan Jones (rib), outside linebacker Von Miller (rest), running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. (groin), offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil (rest), and linebacker Bobby Wagner (knee) did not practice.

New York opened up the week of practice without several players: defensive lineman D.J. Davidson (illness), linebacker Victor Dimukeje (knee), punter Jamie Gillan (left knee), defensive back Nic Jones (shoulder), defensive lineman Rakeem Nunez-Roches (ankle), receiver Gunner Olszewski (concussion), linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux (shoulder) and offensive lineman Greg Van Roten (shoulder). Tight end Theo Johnson (toe) was limited.

Baltimore Ravens (-2.5) at Cincinnati Bengals

Lamar Jackson did not practice on Wednesday, which is becoming a weekly occurrence. This marks the fifth straight week where the Ravens quarterback has missed at least one day of practice. This time, the team noted that it was merely a rest day. Corner Chidobe Awuzie (shoulder) also did not practice, while running back Keaton Mitchell (knee), outside linebacker Tavius Robinson (foot), and corner Nate Wiggins (foot) were limited.

Cincinnati cleared rookie pass rusher Shemar Stewart (knee) to practice and designated him to return from injured reserve. He was a full participant on Wednesday, while receiver Tee Higgins (concussion) was limited. Defensive end Trey Hendrickson (hip, pelvis) was listed as a non-participant, but he is not expected to return to the team this season after undergoing surgery. Safety PJ Jules (ankle) also did not practice.

Running back Alvin Kamara (knee, ankle) did not practice with the Saints on Wednesday, nor did safety Justin Reid or offensive tackle Asim Richards (ankle). Offensive tackle Taliese Fuaga (ankle), running back Devin Neal (abdomen), and defensive end Chris Rumph II (wrist) were limited.

Indianapolis Colts at Seattle Seahawks (-14)

Indianapolis listed quarterback Riley Leonard (knee) as a full participant in practice. With Daniel Jones out for the year, Leonard is an option to start in Week 15, as is Philip Rivers, who signed with the practice squad. Meanwhile, defensive end Tyquan Lewis (ankle), offensive tackle Braden Smith (concussion, neck), corner Sauce Gardner (calf), and receiver Anthony Gould (foot) were non-participants in practice.

Running back Terrell Jennings remained sidelined from Wednesday’s work on the Buffalo Bills while in the NFL’s concussion protocol. But three others went in a limited capacity, including defensive captain and sack leader Harold Landry III, who had missed the first session since the bye week due to a knee issue.

Jennings, the lone absence in Foxborough on Wednesday, exited in the second quarter against the New York Giants as the calendar turned to December. The 2024 undrafted arrival from Florida A&M was downgraded to out for what became a 33-15 win. He played seven snaps on special teams that night, beginning with a 39-yard kickoff return, and was the third backfield option behind Rhamondre Stevenson and NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month TreVeyon Henderson.

Landry, who carried a questionable game status before the bye due to a knee injury, played a season-low 31 defensive snaps on the way to reaching 7.5 sacks. The veteran outside linebacker was back as a limited participant on Wednesday. And across the line of scrimmage, Lowe was also available in that capacity for the Patriots due to an abdomen issue.

Jackson has dealt with knee, ankle, and toe injuries the past several weeks. His absence Wednesday was a non-injury related rest day, however.

The Ravens (6-7) are getting ready for a critical game in Cincinnati. While they still control their own destiny and win the AFC North if they reach the playoffs, they're one game behind the Pittsburgh Steelers with four weeks left.

The last time Jackson had a full week of practice was before the Ravens' Week 10 game against the Minnesota Vikings. He said he felt better moving around in the Ravens' loss to the Steelers and scored his first rushing touchdown since Week 1.

The only other Raven who missed practice Wednesday was cornerback Chidobe Awuzie, who is dealing with a shoulder injury. Awuzie has been one of the Ravens' most consistent defensive players this season. It would leave a void if he's not able to play against the high-powered Bengals passing game.

Running back Keaton Mitchell, who missed the fourth quarter of Sunday's game due to a knee injury, was back at practice but was limited. That's still a good sign for the speedy running back, who ripped off a season-long 55-yard run versus the Steelers.

The league’s concussion protocol failed exactly the way the science says it will.","On Sunday, the Cincinnati Bengals faced the Buffalo Bills, and everyone saw the same terrifying sequence. Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins twisted mid-air to make a spectacular catch, only to come down with the full force of his body driving his head into the frozen turf.

He stayed down, left the field for evaluation, and − minutes later − was cleared to return under the NFL’s concussion protocol. Later, after another hard landing, he was checked again and finished the game. By Monday morning, he didn’t feel right and was placed back into the protocol.

The league's protocol was built to clear players, not protect them

This is not a mystery. It is the predictable failure of a protocol that pretends concussions can be diagnosed − or ruled out − in the heat of a game. The biology doesn’t work that way. Symptoms often appear hours later, exactly as they did with Higgins. His case isn’t an exception; it’s a textbook demonstration of why the current system cannot protect players. The protocol is designed to get them back on the field, not to recognize what is actually happening inside their skulls.

Meanwhile, football culture keeps cheering the very blows that cause these injuries.

Several weeks earlier, on Nov. 13, the Enquirer highlighted former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster describing his concussing hit on former Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict as a “legendary moment” in his career. In the rush to revisit a storied rivalry, the piece folded a traumatic brain injury into the sport’s “color,” as if harm were just part of the scenery. Burfict’s own history of reckless hits does not change the fact that on that play, he was the victim of a concussion − and the celebration of that moment reflects what we have come to accept.

A culture that turns brain trauma into spectacle

The science is not ambiguous. Repeated concussions − and even repeated sub-concussive blows that never make a highlight reel − cause lasting neurological damage. The Boston University CTE Center has studied 376 former NFL players’ brains and found CTE in 345 of them. Their brain bank now holds more than 1,700 donated specimens, with over 800 confirmed cases of CTE. This is one of the clearest cause-and-effect relationships in modern medicine: repetitive head impacts lead to degenerative brain disease.

What makes this a national tragedy is not only what happens on Sundays in the NFL. It’s what happens because of Sundays in the NFL. When professional football glamorizes big hits, delayed-onset concussions, and “legendary” knockouts, the message filters directly into youth sports − where the players’ brains are still developing and far more vulnerable. We are celebrating impacts that, in any other context, would send a child straight to the emergency room.

Football has built a culture that normalizes what we would never tolerate anywhere else. We pretend the violence is harmless because we enjoy the spectacle. Yet every part of the Higgins story − the immediate clearance, the delayed symptoms, the next-day diagnosis − shows how fragile the truth actually is.

The league’s concussion protocol failed exactly the way the science says it will. And as long as we treat brain trauma as entertainment instead of medical reality, more players − from NFL stars to children in school leagues − will bear the cost.

Cover 32: Daniel Jones injury may have set Colts back years, plus game balls, biggest gaffes from Week 14 Tyler Sullivan Evaluating Jones' contract value after the injury It wouldn't be surprising for Jones' camp to push for business as usual financially despite the injury.
The 2026 quarterback transition tag projects to 12.604% of the salary cap (compared to 12.671% in 2025).","A dream season for the Indianapolis Colts has turned into a nightmare. At 7-1, they looked poised for a deep playoff run behind the NFL's best record and an explosive offense averaging a league-leading 33.8 points per game.

Quarterback Daniel Jones, signed to a one-year, $14 million deal worth up to $17.7 million, was enjoying a stunning career resurgence and emerging as an early MVP candidate. Through eight games, he threw for 2,062 yards with 13 touchdowns and two interceptions while completing 71.2% of his passes (173 of 243) for a 109.5 rating. He ranked third in completion percentage, fourth in passing yards and fifth in passer rating league-wide.

Believing Jones had finally stabilized a position that's been unsettled since Andrew Luck's abrupt 2019 retirement, the Colts went all in at the Nov. 4 trade deadline. They acquired All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner from the Jets in exchange for their 2026 and 2027 first-round picks and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell — a win-now move that signaled full commitment to the 2025 season.

But the unraveling began soon after. Jones' play dipped as a fracture in his left fibula sapped the mobility central to his game. Gardner is now out indefinitely with a left calf strain. And Jones' season ended in Week 14 when he tore his right Achilles early in a 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The quarterback room is now in disarray. Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 pick in 2023 who lost a preseason competition to Jones, remains on injured reserve with an orbital fracture suffered in a freak elastic-band accident before Week 6. Rookie sixth-round pick Riley Leonard is dealing with a PCL sprain in his right knee from the Jaguars game.

Out of desperation, Indianapolis signed 44-year-old Philip Rivers to the practice squad. Rivers last played in 2020 -- as the Colts' starting quarterback.

After losing four of five to fall to 8-5, Indianapolis is suddenly in danger of missing the postseason. The remaining schedule offers no relief: Seattle, San Francisco, Jacksonville and Houston -- a quartet with a combined .692 winning percentage -- all would be in the playoffs if the season ended today.

Philip Rivers explainer: Why is the 44-year-old QB making his NFL return by signing with the Colts?

Colts face limited alternatives at QB

Jones' injury puts his future with the Colts in jeopardy. Without first-round picks, it becomes far more difficult for Indianapolis to pivot to a new quarterback through the NFL Draft -- and there may not have been much appetite to go that route anyway after spending a top-five selection on Richardson. The 2026 quarterback class is considered mediocre at best.

There aren't great alternatives in free agency. Aaron Rodgers, now 42, was fairly certain 2025 would be his final NFL season when he signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers in June. Beyond Rodgers, the top options are Marcus Mariota (Commanders), Kenny Pickett (Raiders) and Tyrod Taylor (Jets). Joe Flacco, Gardner Minshew and Carson Wentz -- all of whom previously spent time with the Colts -- will also be available.

Mac Jones would be the best trade option. He kept the 49ers afloat during the eight games Brock Purdy missed with a turf toe injury and will be entering a contract year in 2026, when he's scheduled to make $4.66 million. With the modest salary and a shallow quarterback market, San Francisco should have leverage in any Jones trade talks.

Kyler Murray is another potential trade candidate, as his time in Arizona appears to be nearing an end. Acquiring him would effectively lock a team into a two-year, nearly $79 million commitment due to the structure of his deal. Murray's 2026 salary is $42,542,500, including $36.8 million fully guaranteed. Of the $36.335 million he's scheduled to earn in 2027, his unsecured $19.5 million base salary becomes fully guaranteed on March 15, the fifth day of the 2026 league year.

Jones' recovery outlook and 2026 future

The quarterback landscape sets up for Jones to return to Indianapolis for at least the 2026 season. Before the injury, his camp was likely to seek a deal exceeding the four-year, $160 million contract he signed with the New York Giants in 2023 -- particularly if the Colts planned to use the franchise tag. That contract averaged $40 million per year, included incentives and escalators pushing it to $195 million, and contained $104 million in guarantees, with $81 million fully guaranteed at signing.

A non-exclusive franchise tag in 2026, which was a realistic possibility prior to the injury, is projected to cost 14.576% of that year's salary cap (compared to 14.413% in 2025). If the 2026 cap lands at $300 million -- a 7.45% increase over 2025's $279.2 million -- the tag for quarterbacks should come in around $43.278 million.

The timeline for Jones' recovery remains unclear, though it isn't out of the question that he could be ready for the start of the 2026 regular season. There are recent examples of relatively fast returns from Achilles injuries. Cam Akers came back in just 5½ months after tearing his Achilles in 2021 and became the lead back for the Rams' Super Bowl LVI run. J.K. Dobbins considered himself fully recovered roughly eight months after his 2023 Achilles tear and opened the 2024 season with back-to-back 100-yard games before a separate MCL sprain slowed him, preventing him from having his first 1,000-yard season.

Quarterback recoveries provide an even closer comparison. Kirk Cousins tore his right Achilles in late October of the 2023 season, passed his training-camp physical the following July and opened the 2024 season as the Falcons' starter. Jones, who turns 29 in May, is nearly nine years younger than Cousins, so he could heal even more quickly.

Evaluating Jones' contract value after the injury

It wouldn't be surprising for Jones' camp to push for business as usual financially despite the injury. Before he went down, Jones was having the best season of his career. His 68.0% completion rate, 238.5 passing yards per game and 100.2 passer rating were all career highs.

Cousins is the closest recent contract comp. Less than five months after his own Achilles tear, Cousins received a four-year, $180 million deal (worth up to $188 million) with $100 million in guarantees -- $90 million of which was fully guaranteed at signing -- from the Falcons in 2024 free agency. The $45 million-per-year average made him the NFL's eighth-highest-paid player at the time.

Cousins, however, was far more accomplished, having posted seven 4,000-yard seasons. Jones has yet to reach 3,500 yards in a single year. The Cousins contract now serves as a cautionary tale: his mobility noticeably declined after the injury, and he was benched late in the 2024 season.

A structure similar to the one Drew Brees received when he joined the Saints in 2006 could appeal to Indianapolis if Jones remains viewed as a long-term solution. Because Brees entered free agency with a career-threatening shoulder injury, New Orleans protected itself with a market-rate multi-year deal with the ability to part ways after the first year with minimal salary cap consequences if he couldn't regain his previous form.

The Colts adopted a similar approach with Peyton Manning in 2011 following his neck surgery. As a franchise player, Manning signed a five-year, $90 million deal tying him with Tom Brady as the league's highest-paid player, but Indianapolis had the ability to part ways after one year. Manning missed the entire season, and the Colts moved on after paying him $26.4 million for that one year.

If Indianapolis and Jones' representatives fundamentally disagree on long-term value, Jones' camp might be open to a transition tag in 2026. Under the transition designation, Jones could negotiate with other teams when free agency begins on March 11, and the Colts would have five days to match any offer sheet. If they decline to match, there is no draft pick compensation.

The 2026 quarterback transition tag projects to 12.604% of the salary cap (compared to 12.671% in 2025). With a $300 million cap, that number is expected to be $37.813 million. Even so, Indianapolis may find that figure steep, though it aligns reasonably with the one-year, $25 million deal the team gave Rivers in 2020 when adjusted for cap inflation.

Given the financial risk and uncertainty surrounding Jones' recovery, a two-year contract may ultimately make the most sense. However, the two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million fully guaranteed that Justin Fields received from the Jets is unlikely to satisfy Jones' camp. It's difficult to reconcile that type of contract with the one-year, $28 million extension the Colts gave Jacoby Brissett in 2019, just weeks after Andrew Luck's retirement, despite Brissett being relatively unproven.

A more instructive comparison might be Blake Bortles' 2018 extension with the Jaguars. Bortles received a two-year deal averaging $17,473,500 per season, plus $11.5 million in incentives, when the cap was $177.2 million. The contract carried $26.5 million fully guaranteed. Adjusted for a 2026 salary cap environment, the base value of that deal would fall in the $30 million-per-year range.

A short-term contract at roughly $30 million annually would also align with the marketplace. According to NFLPA data, the average 2025 salary for starting quarterbacks — including those on rookie deals -- is $30,153,958. When rookie-scale quarterbacks are removed, that average jumps to $44,067,508 per year.

Uncertain factors that could shape Jones' future

There would also be a real risk of a quarterback-needy team making a run at Jones if he reaches the open market, injury or not. All bets could be off with a complete collapse where general manager Chris Ballard and/or head coach Shane Steichen lose their jobs.

Another variable is Jones' own financial outlook. Having already secured one major payday, he may be more willing to show some flexibility with Indianapolis. Jones earned $82 million in 2023 and 2024 from his Giants contract alone.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/10/9443cb41-842c-482f-99b6-6ca0db78b796/thumbnail/1200x675/1c2e23624cbbeff8b8359b389caaa021/jones-colts-getty.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 18:02:53.516476

""He’s had it repaired and sounds like everything went well,"" Campbell said Wednesday, Dec. 10, in Allen Park. ""They’re always going to give you the whatever, 8 to 12 months or whatever that is, from the time of surgery. But the surgery went well. Everything went well.""

Branch tore the Achilles tendon in his right leg Dec. 4 trying to break up a pass in the end zone late in the Week 14 win over the Dallas Cowboys.

A second-round pick out of Alabama in 2023, Branch has been one of the Lions' most valuable and versatile defensive players for all three of his NFL seasons.

He ranked second on the team with nine pass breakups, was third with 75 tackles and had 2½ sacks, five tackles for loss and one forced fumble.

Branch was in line for a long-term contract extension before his injury, but now may have to wait until after he returns to the field in 2026.

Former Lions safety Tracy Walker tore his Achilles in Week 3 of the 2022 season and returned to play all 17 games in 2023 − his last season in the league. Walker was cleared to practice in June of that year and was a full participant in training camp, which begins in late July.

If Branch follows a similar timeline, he could be back on the practice field sometime next September.

Along with Branch, left tackle Taylor Decker (shoulder) and linebacker Alex Anzalone (illness) did not practice.

Wide receiver Kalif Raymond returned to practice after a two-game absence due to an ankle injury.

Kerby Joseph (knee), Kayode Awosika (foot), Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle), Thomas Harper (concussion) and Shane Zylstra (ankle/knee) also took part in the open portion of practice.

Zylstra returned to practice from injured reserve for one day last week, but was listed as a non-participant in the Lions' final practice of the week. Campbell said Zylstra did not suffer any setbacks, and could help the Lions' injury-depleted tight end room as soon as this Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Rams.

""It was kind of how we had it planned,"" Campbell said. ""He was out there at walk-through (today), we’re going to have him out at practice today and we’d love to have him at the game barring no setback.

On Wednesday morning, the Giants rookie running back posted a video on his Instagram story showing him walking into the team facility in East Rutherford, N.J. for the first time since suffering a season-ending ankle injury during a Week 8 loss to the Eagles.

“Man, walking into the facility on my own two feet,” Skattebo says in the video. “God is good, man. Just want to say thank you to everybody that supported me. We gettin’ back, let’s go. Gettin’ back to it, let’s go.”

The 23-year-old dislocated his right ankle while getting tackled from behind midway through the second quarter that made for a gruesome scene some of his Giants teammates had to turn away from. Skattebo was later carted off the field with his ankle in an air cast and received a standing ovation at Lincoln Financial Field.

Skattebo detailed more of the injury on YouTuber N3on’s show in November, saying he broke his fibula and “tore the ligament that goes from here [pointing to the top of his foot] to my ankle.”

“Since the bone broke, a full dislocation of the ankle. It was like 90 degrees,” he went on. “There’s a tendon that holds your two bones together at the ankle, that also tore. So they put, it’s called a tightrope, they put it inside. They drill a hole in your bones and they put it in there and it holds your bones together. But it’s really hard to do again — that won’t tear.”

Skattebo previously had his right foot in a boot and utilized a knee walker to get around.

However, the brutal injury hasn’t stopped Skattebo from being active while he is sidelined.

The Giants’ fourth-round pick out of Arizona State had a wild and controversial WWE appearance at MSG in November and sat courtside at the Garden for a Knicks game against the Jazz.

He also was recently out in the New York City Christmas scene with girlfriend Chloe Rodriguez.

Rodriguez posted a series of photos on Instagram on Tuesday. The first is one of her posing in Times Square followed by two of her getting cozy with Skattebo, including a photo of the couple in front of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree in Midtown.

“Thanks for keeping me warm,” Rodriguez wrote in the caption.

Rodriguez, who is a graduate of California State University in Sacramento, has been dating Skattebo since his college days at Arizona State. She was also by his side at the NFL draft this year.

Before his rookie season came to an end, Skattebo racked up 410 yards rushing on 101 carries for five touchdowns while also adding 207 yards receiving plus two touchdowns.

The hope is that Skattebo will be healthy enough to return for Giants training camp in July.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/newspress-collage-cilobk7qm-1765379512439.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1765361535&w=1200,N,,2025-12-10 18:03:15.824398

Roster management becomes slightly different in the postseason, with the primary focus centered on surviving and advancing. But at the same time, you want to make sure your flanks are covered so that a major injury doesn't completely derail your title chances.

For example, we recommended Blake Corum last week as our top pick. Although Kyren Williams is still the Rams' starting running back, Corum has been seeing more work lately. In Week 14, he rushed for 128 yards and two touchdowns on just 12 carries. Even so, Corum is still only rostered in one-third of Yahoo leagues.

Which players can help you on the road to a fantasy league championship? Let's take a look.

Fantasy football players to add for Week 15

Due to the wide variance in types of leagues and individual team needs, the players listed here include their availability rates in Yahoo leagues, which may or may not match rates on other platforms. Since the fantasy playoffs begin this week in most leagues, the bar for picking up players is considerably higher with fewer teams in the mix. Spend whatever you must to get the players you need.

RB Jaylen Wright and Ollie Gordon, Miami Dolphins (3%, 8% rostered)

The biggest health concern for fantasy managers last week came when the Dolphins' De'Von Achane exited early with a rib injury and didn't return. Taking over as the lead back, Wright logged 24 carries for 107 yards. He also scored a short-yardage touchdown, which came before Achane's injury. Gordon, a reliable backup all season, also got into the end zone − but he only saw five carries for 17 yards. Wright would be the top priority if Achane is limited going forward since he outsnapped Gordon 32-16 vs. the Jets. (Recommended FAAB bids: Wright 80%, Gordon 40%)

TE Harold Fannin Jr., Cleveland Browns (40% rostered)

If you need a tight end this week, Fannin is your guy. QB Shedeur Sanders seems to look his way constantly, and he responded on Sunday with a career-high eight catches for 144 yards. He also reached the end zone for the second week in a row. Veteran tight end David Njoku also scored, but he left the game with a knee injury on the play and didn't return. (FAAB bid: 65%)

RB Bam Knight and Michael Carter, Arizona Cardinals (38%, 6% rostered)

The ""... Trey Benson is coming back"" trope is wearing thin. If Benson is not activated off IR this week, he'll be ineligible to play the rest of the season. Knight has been the most productive back in Benson's absence, but the difference between him and Carter hasn't been that great lately − mostly because of the success QB Jacoby Brissett has enjoyed throwing the ball. This week's matchup against the Houston Texans is horrible, but Atlanta and Cincinnati await if you advance. (FAAB bids: Knight 30%, Carter 25%)

WR Ryan Flournoy, Dallas Cowboys (1% rostered)

With CeeDee Lamb exiting in the third quarter with concussion symptoms, Flournoy stepped forward on Thursday as Dak Prescott's top target against the Lions. He hauled in nine of his 13 targets for 115 yards and also scored a touchdown. Lamb will have an extra few days to recover and should be back against the Vikings, but Flournoy is still a great insurance policy with the Cowboys so reliant on their passing game. (FAAB bid: 25%)

WR Isaac TeSlaa, Detroit Lions (12% rostered)

Not going to say his performance has been electric, but the Lions have been quite innovative in getting the ball to their opportunistic rookie. TeSlaa hauled in yet another touchdown on Thursday night vs. Dallas, giving him a total of four on the season − on only eight receptions. He didn't see as much action as expected with star WR Amon-Ra St. Brown shaking off an ankle injury to play almost a full game. Even so, you could say TeSlaa is definitely a plug-and-play receiver should anything happen to St. Brown or Jameson Williams in this high-powered Lions offense. (FAAB bid: 25%)

WR Luther Burden III, Chicago Bears (17% rostered)

It can take time for some rookie wide receivers to find their niche. That could very well be the case for Burden, who led the Bears with six targets and 67 yards on Sunday. His production, however, has been steady, if unspectacular. If you feel comfortable betting on upside, he's shown more lately than either Rome Odunze or D.J. Moore. (FAAB bid: 20%)

WR Rashid Shaheed, Seattle Seahawks (52% rostered)

Shaheed is little above the standard 50% threshold we use for waiver wire eligibility, but we'll include him for shallow-league purposes. On Sunday, he scored his first touchdown since being acquired by the Seahawks, but it came on a kickoff return, not a pass from QB San Darnold. There's always a possibility he can take another return to the house, but what was even more encouraging was his involvement in the offense. Shaheed caught four of five targets for 67 yards at Atlanta, by far his best effort with his new club. (FAAB bid: 20%)

WR Marvin Mims, Denver Broncos (13% rostered)

Mims also performs double duty as a kick returner and he took a punt back for a score on Sunday against the Raiders. However, he seems to be a bit further down the Broncos' pecking order as a wideout than Shaheed is in Seattle. He hasn't seen more than two targets since Week 7, having been passed on the depth chart by rookie Pat Bryant (3% rostered). (FAAB bid: 10%)

TE Dalton Schultz, Houston Texans (47% rostered)

A secondary tight end addition for the playoff run, Schultz didn't do much on the stat sheet Sunday night. But a three-catch, 22-yard performance could have been much better if his red-zone touchdown reception wasn't nullified by a penalty. Before that, Schultz had surpassed 50 receiving yards in six of his previous eight games. A matchup vs. the Cardinals this week should be more to his liking. (FAAB bid: 10%)

Quarterbacks to stream in Week 15

Let's face it, you're in pretty big trouble if you're getting your starting quarterback in a playoff game off the waiver wire. But injuries do happen and we saw Daniel Jones, Jayden Daniels and Geno Smith exit early this past Sunday.

QB Tyler Shough, New Orleans Saints (8% rostered)

He only had 144 passing yards on Sunday vs. Tampa Bay, but he did score a pair of rushing touchdowns. He faces the Panthers and Jets at home, then is at Tennessee in Week 17.

QB J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings (30% rostered)

Finally, McCarthy put up a decent game with three TD passes, albeit against a terrible opponent. However, that will be the case for each of the next three weeks as he goes up against the Cowboys, Giants and Colts − all ranked in the bottom-7 in fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks.

QB C.J. Stroud, Houston Texans (42% rostered)

Stroud had a nice first half and a dismal second half in Kansas City. But like McCarthy with Justin Jefferson, he has a top-tier wideout in Nico Collins, who can make plays all over the field. He has decent home matchups vs. the Cardinals and Raiders before a dangerous road date at the Chargers on championship week.

QB Philip Rivers, Indianapolis Colts (0% rostered)

Yeah, I remember how it went when I was 44 and tried some strenous physical activity I hadn't done in five years ....","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/09/USAT/87688314007-jaylen-wright.jpg?crop=4606,2591,x64,y24&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 17:02:23.206723

Dowman, 15, suffered the injury following a challenge by an opponent during a friendly against Manchester United on Saturday. He is not expected to require surgery.

Arsenal confirmed on Tuesday that the England youth international had been taken out of their Champions League squad following an ankle injury, with Gabriel Jesus added in his place.

Newly-amended UEFA rules state that outfield players can be replaced in the European competition’s squads in the event of a “long-term” injury with an absence of at least 60 days.

Asked about Dowman during Tuesday’s pre-match press conference before Arsenal’s Champions League tie against Club Brugge, Mikel Arteta said: “With Max, unfortunately, he picked up an injury last weekend, and he had to come off, so we did some scans and he is going to be out for weeks.”

After impressing in pre-season Dowman made his first-team debut for Arsenal in the 5-0 victory over Leeds United in August, becoming the second-youngest player to appear for the north London side, behind team-mate Ethan Nwaneri.

In November, he became the youngest player in Champions League history after coming on as a substitute in Arsenal’s 3-0 victory over Slavia Prague, aged 15 years and 308 days.

Dowman has made five senior appearances across all competitions for Arsenal this season, providing one assist.

It was confirmed in October the club had reached an agreement with the midfielder to sign scholarship terms, with a professional contract expected to follow when he turns 17.

Arsenal have contended with a number of injury absentees during the 2025-26 campaign, with Cristhian Mosquera, Kai Havertz, Gabriel, Leandro Trossard and William Saliba currently sidelined.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/10032458/GettyImages-2248698509-scaled-e1765355213821.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-10 16:02:32.476808

Defensively, the Falcons could be without two of their top pass rushers in Brandon Dorlus and Jalon Walker.

Atlanta's defense has fallen hard in recent games, but rookie pass rusher James Pearce Jr. is still causing havoc up front.
It also hasn't helped that the kick-coverage units have consistently given opponents quality field position in recent games.","Baker Mayfield earned some MVP chatter earlier this season, leading stirring comebacks and racking up some impressive numbers, but both have escaped him the past four games. In that span, while Mayfield has endured knee, oblique and shoulder injuries, he's completed only 54.3% of his passes for 530 yards, four TDs and four INTs – after throwing only two picks in the nine prior games. Rookie wideout Emeka Egbuka has had some painful drops in recent games, leading to the passing-game limitations, and the offensive line remains in tough shape. Guard Ben Bredeson left Week 14 with injury and is on IR, weakening the interior offensive line. The Bucs could also be without tight end Cade Otton, but they might welcome back Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan. Both receivers have been limited in practice this week, and are questionable for Thursday. The Bucs could save them for the showdown at Carolina in Week 16, however, they also need the firepower badly with every game critical. Tampa Bay's offense has scored 59 points (while allowing 98) in the past 14 quarters, dating back to the Bills loss. They must find answers fast. Atlanta's defense has fallen hard in recent games, but rookie pass rusher James Pearce Jr. is still causing havoc up front.

With Drake London (knee) ruled out, the Falcons remain perilously short of big-play weapons. Even tight end Kyle Pitts is dealing with a knee injury, limited in practice this week and officially questionable, but the Falcons had better hope plays on Thursday. In the three games London has missed, Pitts has a team-high 15 receptions and 197 yards; no other Falcon has more than nine catches or 96 receiving yards since then. Pitts, 25, will be an intriguing free agent this coming offseason, and he's moving around as well as he has in a few years. He's still not a TD producer (only two scores in his past 22 games), but Pitts can stretch the seam and be a consistent chain mover. Cousins has looked to Pitts more (26 targets) in his four starts than any other pass catcher and almost certainly needs his tight end healthy and available Thursday if the Falcons harbor any hopes of playing spoiler against a desperate Bucs team. Tampa Bay's defense has kept most tight ends in check this season, although Arizona's Trey McBride stung them for eight catches, 82 yards and a TD in Week 13. Pitts also had seven catches (and five first downs) on eight targets against the Bucs back in Week 1, when Penix was at QB.

Tampa Bay is in rough shape defensively. They've seen slightly better results on that side of the ball the past two weeks, but they also lost Tykee Smith and Haason Reddick to injury Sunday, prompting the signing of 36-year-old Jason Pierre-Paul (who hasn't played since 2023) this week. Several other Bucs defenders are nursing injuries, including linebacker SirVocea Dennis and DBs Christian Izien, Benjamin Morrison and Rashad Wisdom, potentially leaving them thin on all three levels of the unit. The Falcons offense is also in bad physical shape now, but they still pose issues with star running back Bijan Robinson and a fruitful run game. It also hasn't helped that the kick-coverage units have consistently given opponents quality field position in recent games. What helps is that Kirk Cousins is by no means a scrambler. Sunday's loss to the Saints highlighted Tampa's Bay's issues with handling mobile quarterbacks as they allowed their fifth and sixth rushing TDs by opposing quarterbacks. So perhaps without that threat, the Bucs can find ways to rush the passer more effectively and key in on stopping Robinson. Otherwise, they might be on the outside looking in prior to the weekend's games being played.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/l7cdyvi9jmhmiemahzjr,N,,2025-12-10 18:03:21.088680

After aggravating the same elbow he dislocated earlier this season in his return to action against the Vikings, head coach Dan Quinn announced in his Wednesday press conference that the quarterback has been ruled out for the Week 15 game against the Giants.

He missed a pair of games earlier in the season with a knee injury before missing one game with a hamstring injury. He then came back to play the Week 9 game against Seattle, suffering his dislocated elbow.

They’re at DEFCON: Sign a 44-year-old Granddad in Indy.

Bringing in Philip Rivers underscores the desperation the Colts are experiencing after Daniel Jones’ season-ending Achilles injury. A QB room that was a question entering the season appeared to be stabilized by Jones. Now it’s more chaotic than a four-year-old’s bedroom after a playdate. Anthony Richardson remains on injured reserve. Rookie Riley Leonard is dealing with a PCL sprain. Clearly, Indy doesn’t trust practice-squad QB Brett Rypien much.

Rivers hasn’t thrown an NFL pass since Jan. 9, 2021, when the Colts lost to Buffalo in the Wild Card Round. That was the last time they made the postseason. Perhaps the football gods have a sense of humor.

The Colts were off to a 7-1 start, with Jones playing superbly. They looked poised to coast into the postseason. The deadline deal for Sauce Gardner was supposed to be the move that put them over the top. Now, Gardner is hurt, Jones is done for the year, and Indy is spiraling.

Losing four of their last five games, the Colts have fallen from the No. 1 seed in the AFC in Week 10 to out of playoff position. Sometimes, four weeks is all it takes to flip the script in the NFL. They have four more to write. Shane Steichen’s club has a 32% chance to make the postseason, per Next Gen Stats, with a measly 6% shot to recapture the division. A win Sunday boosts their odds to 58%, while a loss pushes them to 27%. The 31 percentage-point swing is the highest of any AFC team in Week 15.

They get no reprieve down the stretch. Sunday, they face 10-3 Seattle on the road, then host 9-4 San Francisco, 9-4 Jacksonville and head to 8-5 Houston for the finale. If Indy can’t find a way to best a very good Mike Macdonald defense in Week 15, Rivers’ comeback will be a footnote that does nothing more than push off his Hall of Fame candidacy for five years.

Week 15 opponent: vs. Chargers

Welp, scratch off almost everything I wrote last week. Swing and a miss.

The Chiefs lost the first game of their five-game sprint to the end of the season, with Andy Reid’s offense unable to puncture the Houston defense. Setting aside the controversial fourth-down decisions, the issues that have plagued the team all season were on full display. Patrick Mahomes couldn’t connect on splash plays. The run game offered no reprieve outside of 2-yard dives by Kareem Hunt in short-yardage situations. And the pass-catchers can’t stop dropping balls. Travis Kelce looks like a man seeing the end of the road right in front of him.

The loss to Houston dropped the Chiefs' playoff chances to 10%, per NGS. Their streak of AFC West titles has already been snapped at nine, with their lone shot at extending their playoff streak running through the wild card (1% chance at No. 6 seed; 10% chance at No. 7 seed).

The room for error now is zero. A Week 15 loss would officially eliminate the Chiefs from playoff contention. Even with a win, their odds only increase to 16%. Kansas City needs to win out, and it needs help from others.

On Sunday the Chiefs face a Chargers team that bested the Eagles in overtime on Monday night, with Justin Herbert gritting through a broken left hand. Kansas City lost the season opener to Los Angeles in Brazil, a game that feels like it happened eons ago. Since then, the reigning AFC champions have stumbled in close games, and outside of a three-game win streak in October, haven’t been able to keep their heads above water.

Losers of four of their last five, the Chiefs are on the brink. A win would keep their hopes alive for another week.

Week 15 opponent: vs. Raiders

This again. Philly fans are reliving the cyclical nightmare of following up an NFC Championship with a combustible campaign. The 2025 season is following an eerily similar path to the 2023 implosion, highlighted by a rocky offense and embattled coordinator.

Kevin Patullo’s offense can’t decide what it wants to be, with head-scratching play-calling weekly and an inability to consistently move the chains. He leans on Saquon Barkley for a spell before oddly going away from the reigning Offensive Player of the Year just as he begins to find traction. The Jalen Hurts-led passing attack almost exclusively lives on low-percentage outside throws, in an offense that lacks easy answers for the QB. Before Week 14’s turnover parade, at least we could say Hurts had been taking care of the ball.

The offensive line injuries are a massive issue and underscore that the unit has always been the backbone of the squad.

If it weren’t for Vic Fangio’s defense, the team would already be making Cancun plans.

As in 2023, when Philly got off to a 10-1 start before stumbling down the stretch to finish 11-6 and meekly bowed out of the postseason, the Eagles have been wobbly following their bye. They are 2-3 since the Week 9 break, averaging 16.2 points per game during that stretch.

Luckily for Nick Sirianni’s crew, the Cowboys’ own stumbles have kept the Eagles’ breathing room intact. Philly still has a 91% chance to win the NFC East, per NGS. With games against Las Vegas (2-11), Washington (3-10), Buffalo (9-4) and Washington again, the Eagles control their own destiny.

After their ugly three-game skid, Sunday’s game against Vegas is a must-win, not only to keep Dallas at bay, but to prevent the locals from revolting. Sirianni’s club needs to trounce a two-win opponent to get some mojo back.

Week 15 opponent: at Bengals

There are rollercoasters, then there is whatever the heck the Ravens are riding this season. A 1-5 start, in which the defense couldn’t stop a runny nose, was buttressed by a five-game win streak in which they didn’t allow 20 points. Then, with the division lead in their grasp, they kerplunked back-to-back AFC North home games.

The defensive ebbs and flows have partially stemmed from an inability to consistently get after the passer. Baltimore ranks 30th with 19 sacks this season. Rookie Mike Green leads the team with 2.5 sacks. The inability to push a QB off his spot reared its head in Week 14, when they allowed Aaron Rodgers to turn back the clock and divebomb them for splash plays. Giving life to an offense that had been DOA for much of the season is a bad sign.

While the defense has been a concern, the more pressing issue at this stage is that the offense looks little like what we expect from a Lamar Jackson-led unit. Baltimore has been a turnover machine with six giveaways the past two weeks, including five in Week 13 and a game-changing INT on Sunday.

Jackson hasn’t been nearly as dynamic as in past seasons. He’s generated a single game with 250-plus yards passing (288 in Week 3) and one game with 50-plus yards rushing (Week 1, 70 yards). The hamstring injury, which wiped out three-plus games, has clearly played a role in his reduced explosiveness running the ball, but Jackson hasn’t looked comfortable as a runner or thrower this season.

The Ravens' running game comes and goes. They piled up 217 rushing yards against the Steelers, but they couldn’t push forward in crucial short-yardage situations.

The offensive inconsistency has mirrored the Ravens' tumultuous season. Baltimore has a 40.6% play success rate, per NGS. For comparison, that’s 0.1% higher than the 3-win Saints, who have started Spencer Rattler and rookie Tyler Shough at quarterback. The red zone has been a particular issue. They rank near the bottom of the league in red-zone success rate this season at 32.9%. During their two-game skid, that success rate fell to 21.4%. Baltimore must find a way to reach paydirt more efficiently down the stretch to keep its season alive.

It starts with Sunday’s rematch against Cincy. On Thanksgiving night, the Ravens moved the ball but turned it over five times, allowing the Bengals to run away with the game. If Jackson can’t protect the ball and beat a pillow-soft defense, Baltimore has no shot at resurrecting the season. The Ravens finish up with the 11-2 Patriots, 9-3-1 Packers and a rematch with division-leading Pittsburgh. If they don’t win on Sunday, that Week 18 rivalry matchup could end up being meaningless.

Week 15 opponent: vs. Browns

There are games with more at stake when it comes to making the playoffs, and a loss doesn’t doom Ben Johnson’s club. However, Sunday’s game against a 3-win Browns team is pivotal to preventing the defeats from spiraling. Coming off a loss in Green Bay, it’s not a true trap game for the Bears, but they can’t afford to look ahead to the Week 16 Packers rematch before handling their business.

After falling from the NFC’s No. 1 seed to No. 7, Chicago currently has a 65% playoff probability, per NGS. That figure falls to 47% with a loss, while a win boosts it to 72%.

The Browns are a bottom-five team that just lost at home to the previously 1-win Titans. Yet, the defense, led by Myles Garrett, can wreck games. Rookie Shedeur Sanders has brought more spice to the offense. Cleveland already beat the Packers earlier this year after Green Bay bungled multiple chances to close the game. That should serve as a lesson for Johnson’s crew.

Contending teams regularly blast unworthy opponents. Can Johnson’s club stamp the Browns, or will it come down to the wire, as it has with other doormats, like the one-point wins over Vegas and Washington, and a 4-pointer at home against the Giants?

Caleb Williams has done a masterful job this season when it comes to avoiding the back-breaking plays and he’s made splashing jaw-droppers when needed. Johnson’s ground game has come on strong in recent weeks, and after watching the Titans scamper all over Jim Schwartz's defense last week, he should dial it up another notch. The Bears' defense gives up yards, but feasts on turnovers, generating a league-high 27, including 11 in the past six weeks. They should have a shot to generate a few more against Sanders on Sunday. On paper, a 9-win team should run away with this game. The Bears need to make it so.

In Johnson’s first season, the Bears have avoided -- sometimes miraculously -- the complete clunker against bad teams. They need to prevent the first from happening on Sunday at Soldier Field.

On deck are games against the Packers, 49ers and Lions. A loss to Cleveland, and the Bears would be staring at a slew of virtual must-wins to avoid a ruinous ending to an otherwise positive first season under Johnson.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/m33bnmuopxafjmerl5ge,N,,2025-12-10 16:02:40.174481

Uncertainty surrounding NFL rumors about J.J. McCarthy has Minnesota facing some uncomfortable quarterback questions, and Daniel Jones keeps popping up in the rumor mill as a possible safety net.

With McCarthy concussed, struggling, and Max Brosmer set for his first NFL start, this season is already starting to feel like an extended audition for everyone in the room rather than a real playoff push.

Over at ESPN, Dan Graziano outlined how Jones’ Achilles tear could reshape the landscape, starting with the team that already has him. One scenario he has heard from league sources is Jones simply re-signing with the Colts on a short deal, rehabbing in-house with coaches who know he can run their system and stepping back in once cleared.

That could be another one-year contract or a two-year, incentive-heavy structure that only really pays out if he gets all the way back. Another theory is a return to Minnesota, where Jones finished last season as Sam Darnold’s backup.

The Vikings staff already liked him then, but could not promise a starting job, and bringing him back as a rehab project and competition for McCarthy would fit that template. What almost everyone agrees on, per Graziano, is that talk of a big, long-term extension moves to the back burner after another season-ending injury.

He even heard that a franchise or transition tag in 2026, projected between roughly $39 million and $46 million, is “not off the table,” with both sides likely needing a creative deal that gives Jones more than a one-year rental, given how late the Achilles tear occurred.

Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer has framed the same dilemma in starker terms, pointing out that tagging Jones at that level would effectively triple his current salary and hand him leverage for a $50 million-per-year type contract if he rebounds.

For the Vikings, all of this means any Jones reunion would almost certainly come with caveats. If he ever hits the market, Minnesota makes sense as a suitor that already knows him and badly needs a competent veteran to push McCarthy.

But given how thin this free-agent quarterback class is and how highly the Colts still regard Jones, the more realistic outcome is that his rehab and future are decided in Indianapolis, while the Vikings weigh whether to follow that same “veteran challenger” blueprint with someone else.

After a concussion, athletes are typically told to avoid physical and mental activity until all of their symptoms go away.
In several published articles, researchers in the Sports Concussion Clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital have shown there is little value in complete mental and physical rest following a concussion.
Similarly, patients who exercised after a concussion improved faster than the ones who stopped all physical activity.
That research — along with studies from other groups — led directly to the change in concussion recovery recommendations now practiced around the country.","Concern has been growing in medical, football, and other sports communities that repeated concussions may lead to chronic neurologic health problems such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) later in life. Yet, there is a pressing need for data to help better understand the risk, incidence, progression, and treatment of repeated head trauma.

The NFL has awarded Boston Children’s Hospital a $14.7 million grant to conduct neurological health assessments of up to 2,500 former NFL players. The goal is to better understand long-term neurologic health consequences of concussions and sub-concussive injuries. The research team will be led by William Meehan, MD, of Boston Children’s Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Center, in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Medical College of Wisconsin, and University Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Department in State College, Pa.

The five-year study aims to determine the long-term neurological impact of concussions and repeated brain trauma. Combined with results of a survey conducted in 2001, the project will give a prospective view of health outcomes over a 20-year span. Researchers will also test four potential therapies for the neurological effects of repeated brain trauma. The study is part of a continued effort to improve player safety and quality of life for athletes of all ages, whether the athlete is a national-level player or high school athlete.

After a concussion, athletes are typically told to avoid physical and mental activity until all of their symptoms go away. In several published articles, researchers in the Sports Concussion Clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital have shown there is little value in complete mental and physical rest following a concussion. Based on a series of studies of athletes with concussions, they found that mild or moderate mental activities appeared to have little impact on the time of recovery. High levels of mental activity did appear to delay recovery.

Similarly, patients who exercised after a concussion improved faster than the ones who stopped all physical activity. This was particularly true for adolescent athletes between the ages 14 and 18. That research — along with studies from other groups — led directly to the change in concussion recovery recommendations now practiced around the country.",https://www.childrenshospital.org/sites/default/files/favicon.png,N,,2025-12-10 13:02:48.787470

While the data-charting process is, by nature, objective, our team will obviously form opinions about what they saw, given that we have to watch every play multiple times.

Every week, we’ll select the most notable observations and back them up with the objective data we’ve become known for.

Here are our top observations for 2025 NFL Week 14.

Week 14 Data Charter Observations

1. “Amon-Ra St. Brown is an absolute DOG. Looking like he had no shot to play leading up to the game, he gutted out a great performance. It seemed the Lions intentionally threw him the ball on their first play to set the tone that they were there to save their season by any means necessary. Then, with the game on the line, the Lions dialed up a perfect play-action pass to St. Brown, who put an exclamation point on the night with a 30+ yard catch. He embodies the grit that the Lions are all about.”

Week 14 kicked off with the Lions needing a win and finding a way to emerge victorious in a 44-30 shootout win over the Cowboys on Thursday Night Football. With one of their leaders looking very questionable to suit up, WR Amon-Ra St. Brown gutted out a great performance with 6 catches for 92 yards, including a 37-yard catch and run with the Lions looking to put the game out of reach. St. Brown ended up playing 91.2% of the snaps while picking up 53 yards after the catch, which displayed his toughness, playing through the ankle injury.

It helps to have a real-life video game player in RB Jahmyr Gibbs to rely on for consistent offense when your season is on the line. Gibbs totaled 120 yards on 19 touches while scoring his 47th touchdown in just his 45th career game with 3 rushing touchdowns against the Cowboys. He makes plays every week that other RBs in the league cannot match. The road to the playoffs does not get any easier with a road matchup against the Rams on tap for the Lions next week.

2. “I understand that the Chiefs won two Super Bowls and went back to another without Tyreek Hill, but it’s apparent with this team that their offense is nowhere near the capability it was with Hill on the team. They have tried to bring in several players over the past couple of years to fill that void, but none have come close to the explosiveness Hill brought. That doesn’t mean this team is completely broken, but they’re now a team that is reliant on long, methodical drives that keep them from being a team that routinely scores 30+ points a game to a team that ends up in the 20s far too often. That in turn leads them to playing closer games, and when you play so many one-score games like this team has over the past three seasons, you are bound to have breaks go against you. That’s what you’re seeing with the Chiefs this season. They’re still a great team, but you can only rely on winning close games for so long before the ball starts to bounce the other way, which leads them to the record they have now.”

The Chiefs’ playoff hopes took a major hit following a 20-10 loss to the Texans, marking their fourth loss in the last five games. The Chiefs have seen no shortage of good teams over the past five games, and the Texans’ #1 defense was too much for the Chiefs to overcome. QB Patrick Mahomes was harassed all gam,e leading to just 14 completions on 33 attempts for 160 yards, 0 touchdowns, and 3 interceptions. Among 33 QBs with at least 20 deep pass attempts this season, Mahomes ranks 21st in completion percentage (35.2%), which has led to the 7th most yards (693), but just 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. In turn, the Chiefs are reliant on yards after the catch, ranking second in that category (1,876), meaning they need to sustain long drives to score points.

Another issue is the lack of production from their RBs. Mahomes led the Chiefs with 59 rushing yards on 7 attempts while RBs Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco combined for 60 yards on 21 attempts. For the season, the Chiefs rank tied for 27th in explosive run rate at just 3.1%. The Chiefs streak of difficult opponents continues next week with a home matchup against the Chargers in Week 15.

3. “It’s good to see Travis Etienne producing the way he has been all season. He is maybe lacking a little bit of explosiveness, but he looks like a true veteran running back in the sense that he has a great feel for how to set up blocks and hit holes with precision. I’d like to see him more in the passing game to see if he can dial it back to his days at Clemson, where he was a menace in the open field. Nevertheless, Liam Coen exploits Etienne’s experience in the run game to make him one of the pleasant surprise RBs in 2025.”

The Jaguars seized control in the AFC South with a 36-19 win over the Colts at home in Week 14. RB Travis Etienne carried the ball 20 times for 74 yards and 2 touchdowns, leaving Etienne as the RB10 in rushing yards this season with 917. Among RBs with 100+ carries on the season, Etienne ranks 22nd in explosive run rate at 4.0%, but he does own a healthy 2.50 YBCO/ATT average, showing good blocking and ability to set up those blocks. One area that has been a bit limiting for him this season is in the passing game, where his route share sits at 37.1%, leading to 26 catches on the season (25th among RBs).

WR Jakobi Meyers continued to be a good mid-season acquisition for the Jaguars with 4 catches, 39 yards, and 1 touchdown against the Colts. Although his receiving total was down this week, Meyers leads the Jaguars with 30 targets, 22 catches, 284 receiving yards, and 3 touchdowns since they traded for him prior to Week 10. Up next is a good spot for Etienne and the running game as they take on the Jets, who have given up 1,813 rushing yards this season (3rd most).

4. “This might have been the best quarterbacked game I've watched this year, as both Joe Burrow and Josh Allen consistently put the ball in tight windows and created plays with their legs. Back-to-back INTs of passes batted at the line muddied Burrow's numbers and hurt the Bengals already slim playoff chances, but this game was evidence that they still could've been in the mix had he been healthy all year.”

The showdown between Josh Allen and Joe Burrow lived up to the hype with the Bills pulling out a thrilling 39-34 win over the Bengals. As is the case with most high-profile Bills games this season, Josh Allen put on the Superman cape and threw for 251 yards on 22 of 28 passing for 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions to go along with 78 yards and another touchdown on the ground. Allen was dialed in throwing the ball, registering a 5.7% CPOE, 84.6% ADJ COMP, 75.0% ACC, 89.3% CATCH, and 0.0% TWT. It might have been Allen’s best game as a passer all season, which will need to continue next week in a pivotal AFC East matchup with the Patriots.

On the other side, Joe Burrow nearly pulled off an upset with 284 passing yards and 4 touchdowns, but 2 costly interceptions were too much to overcome. Burrow was a little less accurate than Allen on the day, but did show off his willingness to give his pass catchers a chance for a big play with an 11.1% hero throw rate. His undoing came in the fourth quarter on a screen pass that was intercepted and returned for a touchdown, followed by another interception on the Bengals’ very next offensive play. The Bengals’ last hopes of making the playoffs rest on a home game against the Ravens in Week 14.

5. “Jerry Jeudy was wide open down the field two times in a short span before getting hit on a crosser that he took 60 yards to the house. The Browns looked like they were able to threaten more down the field and to the boundaries, creating tons of YAC room later in the game on passes to the flats and across the middle of the field.”

Despite taking a loss by a final of 31-29 at the hands of the Titans, the Browns found their first 300-yard passing game from a QB in over a full calendar year. QB Shedeur Sanders threw for 364 passing yards, 3 touchdowns, and 1 interception on 23 of 42 passing while adding 29 yards and 1 touchdown on 3 rushing attempts. Last week, we talked about Sanders giving the Browns their best hope at running a traditional offense, and he delivered against the Titans. Sanders averaged a decent aDOT of 8.1 and was able to give his playmakers a chance to pick up yards after the catch as 74.2% of Sanders’ yards were after the catch. Still plenty of room for improvement as Sanders held onto the ball too long by averaging 3.43 TTT and throwing to his first read on just 42.9%. Overall, it was a good performance from Sanders, which at least gives him something to build on next week as the Browns travel to Chicago to take on the Bears.

6. “On one hand, I feel for Justin Herbert because he is constantly under fire and trying his best to make a play. On the other hand, he needs to do a better job of getting rid of the ball. The Chargers’ shortcomings on the offensive line are well known, yet Herbert has a tendency to stand in the pocket waiting for receivers to uncover. He possesses some of the best athletic ability of any QB in the league with his arm strength and running ability, but I’d like to see the Chargers dial up more quick hitters to relieve the pressure that Herbert sees play-in and play-out. The pass rush can’t get home if the QB doesn’t have the ball in his hands.”

Week 14 came to an end with the Chargers outlasting the Eagles in a hard-fought 22-19 win in overtime. With the Chargers’ defense coming up with 4 interceptions on the night, they were able to overcome a sluggish performance on offense. QB Justin Herbert had surgery less than a week ago, but was able to grind out 139 passing yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception to go along with 66 rushing yards on 10 carries. With multiple offensive linemen out, Herbert was under pressure on a league-high 68.3% of his dropbacks, but he averaged the 5th-longest TTT (3.10). For the season, Herbert’s time to pressure is the second fastest at 2.41, and his time to throw is the ninth fastest at 2.56. The discrepancy between his TTP and TTT is the 4th-widest discrepancy in the NFL, which is a recipe for disaster because the Chargers are struggling in pass protection, but Herbert is also holding onto the ball too long. The Chargers have overcome their pass protection woes to sit at 9-4, but they play a difficult schedule to finish the season starting with a road game against the Chiefs next week.

Bonus Observations

Bucs WR Emeka Egbuka —The Bucs utilized a ton of screens and weren't able to take many shots down the field and couldn't execute when they attempted them. Emeka Egbuka couldn't come down with a deep shot late that would've been a TD after a beautiful route. Egbuka has hit a rookie wall, failing to cross 50 receiving yards in five out of his last six games while owning a 40.4% catch rate in that span.

Saints QB Tyler Shough —Shough looked like a potential starter in this league. The game was played under terrible conditions, so it’s hard to get a true read on him as a passer. That said, his running ability looked awesome and something that he can lean into as he progresses as a starter. He also makes some throws that you can see him becoming a viable QB for the Saints and for fantasy teams. Shough posted 144 passing yards, 0 touchdowns, and 1 interception, but his running ability was excellent with 7 carries for 55 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns against the Bucs.

Packers WR Christian Watson —Watson is ballin’ since coming back from injury. Of course, injuries have always been his biggest downfall since he popped up on the injury report nearly every week in his first few seasons. That said, he is clearly a huge difference maker for the Packers. Watson caught 4 passes for 89 yards and 2 touchdowns en route to his fifth touchdown in his last 4 games. He also registered his highest snap share of the season at 84.6%.

Vikings QB JJ McCarthy —I think the early results from JJ McCarthy’s earlier starts were partially harmed due to some bad luck and this game may have swung the opposite way due to a bad Commanders defense. McCarthy looked comfortable in the pocket and moved around to create throwing lanes, showing complete command of the offense. McCarthy completed 16 of 23 passes for 163 passing yards and 3 touchdowns, marking his first game this season without a turnover.",https://static.fantasypts.com/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-10 15:03:19.255485

Shilo Sanders, who is out of football, is now pursuing music, acting, and brand deals.

Shedeur and Shilo Sanders have gotten to the bottom of one of the biggest mysteries this week in the NFL.

Was Shedeur, the Cleveland Browns starting quarterback, wearing a thong under his uniform during a 31-29 loss against the Tennessee Titans on Dec. 7?

It kind of looked like it, according to a screen shot after one play. Shilo, his older brother, conducted a not-so-serious investigation about it and then posted the findings on YouTube.

“Let’s cut to the business, bro,” Shilo said to Shedeur by phone. “Did you wear a thong or not?”

“Come on bro,” Shedeur replied.

“What’s going on with you, bro?” Shilo persisted.

“You forget I have a back injury, right?” Shedeur said. “So I get my back taped. So it is crazy that I did look like that… That is funny, though.”

Shedeur suffered a fractured back during the 2023 season at Colorado. Shilo and Shedeur are sons and former players of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders.

What is Shilo Sanders doing now?

Shilo is out of football after being waived by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before the season. In the video, he said he is moving from Tampa to Miami, where he said he is looking for a chef to cook for him and has been working on a rap album. He also said he was considering acting classes and has been doing YouTube videos and brand deals.

Shilo filed for bankruptcy in 2023 in a case that remains pending. In general, he is entitled to earnings he made after the filing.

“In the future, I definitely want to build that up – the music and the acting, the modeling, all that,” he said.

Shilo modeled with his brother in Paris in January 2024.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/10/USAT/87693218007-usatsi-27767528.jpg?crop=3979,2238,x78,y37&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 14:02:52.685866

Most of the favorites stayed in similar positions after wins. Only the AFC South registered a lot of movement between its three contenders, with one taking a nosedive and two slashing their odds in half to climb up the board.

Losses by two season-long title contenders also shook things up, with the Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs also rapidly falling.

With only four weeks left in the regular season, there are still plenty of interesting Super Bowl contenders. But as we saw after Week 14, additional contenders could start to fall off with injuries or bad losses.

Favorites mostly stay the same

There was minimal movement among the top seven Super Bowl contenders after Week 14. Staying on top, the Los Angeles Rams (+400) moved up slightly from +450 odds after an easy win in Arizona. Returning to peak form, QB Matthew Stafford regained the lead in the odds to win MVP after 281 passing yards and three TDs against the Cardinals.

The Seattle Seahawks (+750) and Green Bay Packers (+800) remain in the two spots after the Rams. Dominant defense and a big second half lifted Seattle past Atlanta, and Green Bay held off Chicago to take control of the NFC North with a win at Lambeau Field.

Three teams from the AFC continued a slow climb. The Buffalo Bills (+850) lead the pack, followed closely by the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots (+1000). That trio surpassed the Philadelphia Eagles (+1100) — who dipped from a tie for third and +900 odds following a Monday night loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.

Despite three straight losses, the Eagles maintain the NFC East lead. And with three of their four remaining matchups against teams competing for the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft, Philadelphia remains in a good position to secure a playoff spot.

Big games ahead

New England hosts Buffalo after the Patriots won the first matchup in Week 5 on the road. Denver welcomes Green Bay to begin a difficult four-week stretch to close the season. Detroit will try to play its way back into playoff contention in Los Angeles against the Rams.

The Patriots and Broncos are tied for the best record in the AFC and are two games ahead of Jacksonville, the Chargers and the Bills.

AFC South teams make moves

Things evolved rapidly in the AFC South over the last month, culminating in two new teams sitting on top after Week 14. Earlier this season, it looked like a potential runaway for the Indianapolis Colts — who sat at +1100 Super Bowl odds and a potential top playoff seed in the AFC after Week 11.

Fast forward to now: The two biggest risers are the rival Houston Texans (+1500) and Jacksonville Jaguars (+2000), with Indianapolis (+15000) completely free-falling.

The Texans earned a huge road win in Kansas City to continue their five-game winning streak. Jacksonville defeated the Colts in the first of two December matchups to improve to a four-game winning streak.

The losing stretch for Indianapolis, coupled with the season-ending Achilles injury to quarterback Daniel Jones, dropped them from +1500 odds and eighth place to 19th in a week. Currently outside of the AFC playoff picture and without its starting QB, it could be a miserable second-half for the Colts after the promising 8-2 start.

Former favorites finally fall down the board

Two season-long favorites finally saw sharp falls down the board after hovering in the second tier in recent weeks. It appears the Super Bowl market finally ran out of patience for the Baltimore Ravens (+3500) and Kansas City Chiefs (+5000).

Both teams sat at +1700 odds before Week 14 losses put both at 6-7. While the Ravens’ loss to Pittsburgh put them only one game out of first place in the AFC North, a home loss to Houston tanked Kansas City’s Super Bowl odds.

Baltimore needs to keep winning to have a chance at the AFC North and finishes Week 18 with a rematch in Pittsburgh.

The Chiefs are still two games out of the final AFC playoff spot with four weeks left. They likely need to win out and would still need significant help just to make the postseason. For a team that was atop BetMGM’s Super Bowl odds from Week 7 through Week 11, that’s a significant fall.

A popular dark horse in recent weeks, the Chicago Bears (+5000) also saw a significant decline in odds with the loss in Green Bay.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/09144201/GettyImages-2250584375-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-10 11:05:46.055782

Jones injury fallout | Moves for falling contenders

Open coach jobs | What's next for Vance Joseph

What are you hearing on how Daniel Jones' injury could affect free agency and the QB market?

Graziano: I've heard a few theories in the couple of days since Jones injured his Achilles. One is that it makes sense for him to re-sign with the Colts, since they know him and know he can run their offense. He could rehab with them all offseason and hit the ground running whenever he's cleared. That could be on another one-year deal or maybe a two-year deal with incentives that could make the second year more lucrative if he recovers fully and plays well.

Another is that it would make sense for him to go back to Minnesota, where he finished last season as Sam Darnold's backup, and rehab there with a staff that knows him and wanted to retain him but couldn't guarantee him the starting job this past offseason. Either way, the idea of a lucrative, long-term contract extension in Indianapolis (or somewhere else) probably slides to the back burner in light of Jones' most recent season-ending injury.

The other thing to consider, Jeremy, is who's going to be making the decisions for the Colts this offseason, since there has been chatter about coaches and front office personnel being on the hot seat since last offseason. I wonder how a potential late-season collapse (if that what's coming) would affect things on that front.

Fowler: The Colts' brass had quelled the noise with this season's hot start, Dan, but new owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon will evaluate the full body of work. Since a repeat 8-9 season is still on the table, finishing with seven consecutive losses wouldn't be the best thing for the future tenures of head coach Shane Steichen or general manager Chris Ballard. But I think everyone there recognizes that Indy has built a good team that thrived over the season's first 10 games -- especially Jones, who remains the top free agent quarterback available despite this injury.

If the Colts and Vikings pursue Jones, then he has a nice little market to drive up his demand. But maybe it doesn't get that far ... if Indianapolis puts the franchise or transition tag on Jones. That's not totally off the table after asking around. Those numbers are projected somewhere between $39 million and $46 million. Either way, getting creative with the contract to cover both sides will be important, but Jones will need security beyond a one-year deal considering how late in the calendar year the Achilles tear occurred.

So, the injury is a factor, but I'm not so sure it affects his market too much. As you know, Dan, the upcoming free agent class isn't exactly loaded at quarterback.

Graziano: Sure, but I guess the point of the question is more about the reduced likelihood of a big deal, like a Baker Mayfield-type deal or Darnold-level deal -- or heck, even the type of deal Jones got from the Giants a few years back. I think that's the impact of the injury -- that he and whichever team he ends up with will have to be creative and, as you suggest, build something that gives Jones some time to not only get back onto the field but also get back to playing at a relatively high level.

Jones is still only 28, so there's certainly plenty of hope for him to recover and still have a future in the league. But this is also the third season-ending injury of his career, and that history has to be a concern for whichever team is interested in signing him.

Fowler: That's valid. My sense is Indianapolis will want to see how Jones is progressing in his rehab before deciding. That will help inform the team on how to proceed. If the Colts believe Jones will be a productive starter for them over the next three to four seasons, then perhaps paying him a respectable market deal now will be a discount in two years, instead of haggling over the level of discount required because of the injury.

Jones has been Indy's most viable quarterback option since Andrew Luck, so the Colts might not be afraid to pay him big. Coaches and teammates there love him. And a few other teams could be facing a quarterback transition -- the Browns, Jets and Raiders among them.

What is one realistic offseason move that could help fix a fallen preseason favorite?

Fowler: The Chiefs and Ravens are both teams that need a classic boundary receiver on the outside and could address that with one big move in free agency. George Pickens would be a significant upgrade in Baltimore, and Alec Pierce would satisfy that need in Kansas City, which has been starved for explosive playmaking on the outside since Tyreek Hill was traded after the 2021 season.

Both would be costly, and Pickens might be franchise tagged by Dallas. But if available, the Ravens could use some of their $40 million in 2026 cap space on Pickens, knowing John Harbaugh is good at managing big personalities. The Chiefs are much lower on space, sitting at minus-$42.8 million, but cuts are on the way for a team that might look drastically different this time next year. Also, adding an explosive running back such as Breece Hall or Travis Etienne Jr. is worth exploring for Kansas City.

Graziano: Running back makes sense for the Chiefs, as does diversifying their WR room. I wonder if missing the playoffs and having a reset forced upon them might not be the worst thing in the world -- though I'm sure the Chiefs don't see it that way.

The Commanders need pass-rush help, linebacker help, secondary help ... all of it. I wouldn't be stunned if they devoted most of their draft resources to the defense, though they don't have any picks in the second or fourth rounds because of the Laremy Tunsil trade. On offense, Washington is a spot a lot of people have pegged as a potential destination for Brandon Aiyuk, as it's believed he'd like to team up with former Arizona State teammate Jayden Daniels.

Fowler: The Aiyuk-Washington connection makes a ton of sense. Speaking of the Commanders, it was shocking to me when they didn't aggressively address pass rusher last offseason. As a result, their sack leader is Dorance Armstrong -- who tore his ACL in Week 7 -- with 5.5. Plenty of pass rushers should be available in free agency. But Washington could also identify rushers on rookie deals who might want a trade due to inactivity on a contract extension with their current team. The Jaguars' Travon Walker, Giants' Kayvon Thibodeaux and Jets' Jermaine Johnson are among players on expiring rookie deals who could be 2027 free agents.

As for Cincinnati, Dan, the Bengals need everything on defense except maybe a cornerback. Up the middle, there's a need at every level (defensive line, linebacker, safety).

Graziano: Trey Hendrickson seems certain to be leaving Cincinnati, which hasn't exactly hit it out of the park with its recent, high-round edge rusher draft picks. The Bengals don't spend big, but they hit in free agency once upon a time with Hendrickson, and I think they'll look for a solution along those lines again this offseason.

So yes, I'm interested to see what the Bengals do on defense. Do they give Al Golden a second year as coordinator, or are we looking at another scheme change? The way they feel their linebackers have improved as the season has progressed makes me think they'll run it back with Golden and add players he thinks fit his system. I always wonder if the Bengals will get creative with a player-for-player trade and bring in someone like Thibodeaux or Byron Young, who could be available toward the tail end of their rookie deals.

What's the over/under on open head coaching jobs this offseason?

Graziano: I'll set it at six, since two (Titans and Giants) are already open and we're watching for potential change in places such as Las Vegas, Atlanta, Arizona, Miami, Cleveland and Cincinnati. I'm not saying all of those will come open, of course, but it wouldn't be shocking if three or four of them did.

Pete Carroll's first season with Raiders has been a disaster and they've already let go of two coordinators. The Falcons and Cardinals had higher preseason expectations than what has been delivered (though I lean toward Arizona keeping its coaches and letting them try to develop a quarterback post-Kyler Murray). It sounds as if Mike McDaniel has a chance to save his job in Miami with a strong finish, which he seems to be on his way to putting together, but any time the GM gets fired midseason (as Chris Grier was in Miami), more potential change could be on the way.

Kevin Stefanski isn't necessarily to blame for the Browns' quarterback mess, but his record the past two seasons is 6-24 and a turnaround doesn't seem imminent. A couple of people have suggested to me that Stefanski would be of interest to other teams if the Browns moved on, as he's well-regarded around the league. And the Bengals are unpredictable, and Zac Taylor has only one year left on his deal. Then again, he's either the most or second-most successful coach in franchise history, has established a contending culture and is well liked by the star quarterback. So my guess is he returns. But again, more was expected this season in Cincinnati, so at the very least we have our antennae up.

Fowler: A spot-on breakdown of the landscape, Dan, and though I'd love to say seven openings for entertainment, I'm not sure I can get there yet. I'll stand firm with you at six. Picking up where you left off, Bengals owner Mike Brown operates a little differently -- perhaps he lets Taylor coach out his contract that runs through 2026. It feels as if anything is possible there. Across the state, one thing that helps Stefanski's case is that Browns owner Jimmy Haslam finally found a dependable infrastructure with Stefanski and GM Andrew Berry, and the two-year struggle can be directly tied to the failed Deshaun Watson experiment. The team is very young but should be good in 2026 due to their exciting 2025 rookie class. That said, 6-24 is 6-24. Let's see what happens over the next month.

I'm with you on the Cardinals. Keeping Jonathan Gannon is a sensible play for owner Michael Bidwill. But Arizona is staring at a potential 1-14 finish. The team is miserably bad right now and finishes the season with the Texans, Falcons, Bengals and Rams. Gannon might need to win one, maybe two games to reach solid footing. The Raiders are really struggling, which should surprise no one given the talent disparity. This team needs someone to usher in the rebuild. And McDaniel is helping his cause with Dolphins, and enough people around the league think he has made a compelling case to stay.

So, if we're sliding Miami out of the mix, that means four of the five spots you mentioned above would need to open to reach six. That's entirely possible, especially with the smoke rising around Raheem Morris in Atlanta. If we're forecasting potential surprises, what comes to mind? There's usually at least one.

Graziano: Well, my stock answer to that is always, ""If I knew that, it wouldn't be a surprise!"" But you're right, there does always seem to be one that catches us off guard. I keep getting asked if I think the Steelers or Ravens jobs would come open if either team were to miss the playoffs. I don't think they will come open, but the market would shake up in a big way if I'm wrong.

Andy Reid turns 68 next spring and there were retirement noises swirling around him a couple of years ago, but I think the contract extension he received indicates that he's not interested in hanging it up any time soon -- especially with how disappointing this season seems to be for the Chiefs. How about you? What's your surprise pick?

Fowler: The Ravens are really interesting. That would qualify as a pretty major surprise, and while I think Harbaugh stays, something seems off there. They should not be 6-7 based on their roster talent. The lack of offensive production has been a source of frustration internally. This feels more like a reset in 2026, with multiple staff changes on the way. The Mike Tomlin smoke surfaces annually, but he's fiercely loyal to Pittsburgh, and here he is rallying the Steelers to a big late-season divisional win again. We touched on the Colts earlier ... that would qualify as a surprise, too.

What are you hearing about Vance Joseph's chances to land a head coach gig? Is he the top candidate at the moment?

Fowler: The coaching pool is strongest on the defensive side this year, and Joseph is well-positioned among available defense-oriented candidates. His Broncos defense set a franchise record with 63 sacks in 2024, which this year's defense easily should break, with 55 sacks through 13 games. Former head coaches will be a theme this year, and Joseph has head coaching experience. Much will depend on exactly what teams are looking for and the interview process, but he should get plenty of chances. If Miami opens, remember that Joseph was a finalist for the Dolphins job that went to Mike McDaniel in 2022 and is still well-regarded there.

Graziano: Joseph seems to be the name we're hearing the most, because of Denver's defensive success and his previous head coach experience (with Denver, oddly enough). People close to the situation point out that Joseph never had a stable quarterback situation in his first head coaching stint and didn't have full autonomy over the hiring of his staff, so it would seem unfair to completely hold his 11-21 record against him. I think he gets several interviews and could be a strong candidate in a place such as Las Vegas, should that job come open.

Fowler: Joseph is part of a crowded class of defensive coordinators. The Rams' Chris Shula, Packers' Jeff Hafley, Chargers' Jesse Minter and Dolphins' Anthony Weaver are all ascending coordinators looking to be first-time coaches. The Seahawks' Adin Durde and Jaguars' Anthony Campanile are under-the-radar names bubbling to the surface. And the 49ers' Robert Saleh has reestablished himself as a potential second-time head coach after helping lead injury-hampered San Francisco to a winning season. Lou Anarumo has also reestablished himself in Indy.

Graziano: I think the key point you made earlier, which I keep hearing from people in discussions about this coaching cycle, is that teams will be looking for candidates with previous head coaching experience. There's a thought that the coordinator pool, especially on the offensive side, has dried up a bit because of all the quick hirings and firings of the past decade-plus.

People see what Mike Vrabel has been able to do in New England this season and what Jim Harbaugh has been able to do with the Chargers in his first two years there, and teams want to make sure they're bringing in someone they know can run a program -- not someone who has just been really good at the smaller job who they think can run a program. I think that gives guys like Joseph, Arthur Smith, Matt Nagy, etc. a chance. Even if they weren't successful in their first stints as head coaches, they've done the job and probably learned from whatever mistakes they might have made the first time.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1209%2Fr1587239_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 09:01:04.124437

No Colts team since that 2020 squad has averaged more passing yards than the 253.3 per game produced with Rivers at the controls.","INDIANAPOLIS -- Philip Rivers is adding one more chapter to his NFL story.

The longtime star quarterback, who retired after the 2020 season -- his 17th in the NFL -- is rejoining the Indianapolis Colts on their practice squad, sources told ESPN, amid an injury crisis that has left them with three sidelined quarterbacks.

Rivers worked out for the Colts on Monday evening. The news comes one day after Rivers' 44th birthday, instantly making him the oldest active player in the NFL.

That positions him to be an option to play in place of third-string quarterback Riley Leonard, who sustained a knee injury while relieving Daniel Jones in Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Jones sustained a right Achilles tear and will undergo season-ending surgery this week. Anthony Richardson Sr., who began the season as the No. 2 quarterback, has been on injured reserve since October after suffering a serious facial fracture in an equipment failure involving stretching bands.

It remains to be seen what Rivers' immediate role will be. Leonard's status for the Colts' next game, at the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, is still unclear. The team is hoping for more clarity Wednesday, according to a source.

On Monday, coach Shane Steichen left the door open. When asked whether Leonard would play Sunday, he said, ""That's the hope. We'll see how it goes."" A source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Monday night that Leonard had a strained knee ligament and was considered week-to-week.

If Leonard can't play, Rivers might enter the picture. Still remembered fondly at Colts headquarters following his one season with Indianapolis in 2020, Rivers will be reunited with his close friend Steichen. The two previously spent six seasons together in the Chargers organization while Steichen was an assistant coach and Rivers was the team's longtime quarterback.

They remain in regular contact and often discuss football matters on a weekly basis. Steichen's relationship with Rivers helped this arrangement come together, according to sources.

According to sources, Rivers' workout was impressive. He threw the ball well but needs to improve his conditioning, according to a source. How that impacts his ability to play this week, if necessary, is unclear.

Rivers is currently a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Class of 2026. Per the Hall of Fame, Rivers signing to the Colts' practice squad has no effect on his eligibility. However, if he signs to the Colts' active roster, his eligibility clock would reset, whether or not he takes a snap in a game, and he wouldn't be eligible again until 2031.

Rivers' 2020 Colts performance was impressive. The Colts finished 11-5 with Rivers under center, making the playoffs as an AFC wild card. They lost to the Buffalo Bills in a first-round game and, several weeks later, Rivers decided to walk away from the NFL.

No Colts team since that 2020 squad has averaged more passing yards than the 253.3 per game produced with Rivers at the controls. Indianapolis won four of its last five games that season to clinch a playoff spot. And Rivers delivered throughout the season, completing 68% of his pass attempts and throwing 24 touchdown passes.

The mere exploration of Rivers as a possibility speaks to the dearth of options for Indianapolis. The Colts also have journeyman Brett Rypien on their practice squad, but he has yet to be added to the active roster this season.

If Rivers starts a game for the Colts this season, he would become the fifth quarterback in NFL history to start a game at age 44 or older, joining Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Steve DeBerg and Warren Moon, according to ESPN Research.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0110%2Fr800285_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 04:57:52.124610

Shaheed’s breakout game is great sign for Seahawks

Sundell, who started the first nine games of the season at center, has missed the past four games after suffering a knee injury in Seattle’s Week 10 rout of the Arizona Cardinals on Nov. 9. Backup center Olu Oluwatimi has started the past four games in Sundell’s place.

Macdonald said “we’ll see” when asked whether Sundell will play center or guard going forward.

There’s been speculation that Seattle could consider keeping Oluwatimi at center and sliding Sundell over to right guard, where Anthony Bradford has struggled at times this season.

Sundell, a second-year undrafted offensive lineman out of North Dakota State, has the positional flexibility to play center or guard. Oluwatimi is solely a center.

Sundell and Oluwatimi were in a two-man battle for the starting center job throughout training camp. Sundell ultimately won the competition after Oluwatimi dealt with a back injury that sidelined him for all three preseason games.

Bradford showing improvement

Bradford, who has started all 13 games at right guard this season, had a particularly rough first seven games. Through Week 7, he ranked 73rd out of 82 guards in Pro Football Focus grading, including 79th in pass block grading. During that span, he allowed two sacks and 17 pressures.

But since Seattle’s Week 8 bye, Bradford has played much better. Over the past six games, he ranks 52nd out of 81 guards in PFF grading, including 30th in pass block grading. And during that span, he’s allowed no sacks and just three pressures.

“AB graded out as our highest offensive lineman (Sunday), and he’s playing hard and he’s got a great punch,” Macdonald said. “I think his overall confidence is probably at a high point in his career at this point – practicing really well, practices hard. I mean, doing all those steps that it takes to end up (playing) good football out on the field.

“And I know there’s some plays that are minuses or plays that aren’t up to par, but there’s a lot of great plays as well, and I thought he had a good game yesterday.”

The latest on Arroyo

Macdonald said rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo could miss Seattle’s upcoming game against the Indianapolis Colts after suffering a knee injury in Sunday’s win over the Atlanta Falcons.

Arroyo, a second-round draft pick out of Miami, has 15 catches for 179 yards and a touchdown this season. He has played 39.5% of the Seahawks’ offensive snaps.

“Just working through it right now, but I’d say that this week is probably in jeopardy for him,” Macdonald said.

Will Rivers, celebrating his 44th birthday Monday, Dec. 8, return to guide a desperate team in search of a playoff berth?

NFL Network is reporting that the Colts will bring in Rivers to potentially suit up in the wake of Daniel Jones' season-ending injury and Riley Leonard's knee issue that leaves him uncertain for Week 15 against the Seattle Seahawks.

On top of all that, it’s possible an even more desperate team could outbid the Colts for Jones’ services.
What started as a season of surprise has turned into disbelief at how quickly the Colts have been given an uncertain future.","Ten weeks into the NFL season, the Indianapolis Colts were the surprise of the league.

After a 31-25 win over the Atlanta Falcons in Berlin on Nov. 9, the Colts were 8-2, tied for the most wins in the AFC, and had a legitimate chance to be the No. 1 seed in the conference headed into the playoffs.

But just one month later, Indianapolis is 8-5, loser of three straight and owner of a murky future after a risky trade and a catastrophic injury.

Things started going downhill with a losing streak that included two close defeats.

The Colts had a 20-9 fourth-quarter lead on the road against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 12, only to give up the final 14 points of the game and lose in overtime. The next week, Indianapolis was tied 13-13 with the Houston Texans in the fourth before losing 20-16.

The wheels came off Sunday in a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Not only was Indianapolis blown out 36-19, but quarterback Daniel Jones — an early-season MVP candidate and one of the feel-good stories of the year — also tore his right Achilles, ending his season.

“That’s our team leader, our team captain,” wide receiver Alec Pierce told reporters after the game. “It’s brutal.”

After the loss to the Jaguars, Indianapolis went from tied for first place in the AFC South to out of the playoff picture entirely, and it now faces issues on multiple fronts.

Having lost four of their last five games, the Colts are in danger of missing the playoffs entirely. Indianapolis has four games left, all against teams that would currently be in the playoffs. (The .692 winning percentage of the Colts’ remaining opponents is the highest in the NFL, per Tankathon.)

In addition to the injury to Jones, backup quarterback and rookie Riley Leonard is dealing with a knee injury, head coach Shane Steichen said Monday. Steichen added “the hope” is that Leonard can play Sunday, though there is no guarantee.

The only other healthy quarterback on the team is Brett Rypien, who is on the practice squad. Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2023 draft, has thrown only two passes in garbage time this season and is on injured reserve with an orbital fracture.

How severe is the situation? Indianapolis reportedly will work out 44-year-old Philip Rivers on Tuesday. Rivers last played in the NFL for the Colts in 2020 and announced his retirement in January 2021. He has since been coaching high school football in Alabama.

In his lone year with Indianapolis, Rivers went 11-5, completing 68.0% of his passes for 4,169 yards, with 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He also has experience with Steichen, who was an assistant coach with the then-San Diego Chargers from 2014 to 2019 while Rivers was on the team.

Meanwhile, the injury to Jones puts Indianapolis in a tricky situation with regard to the team’s future at quarterback.

Jones is on a one-year contract that pays him only $14 million. He was almost certainly in line for a massive raise before the injury, though he had cooled off after his hot start to the season.

Now, the Colts will have to make a decision on Jones without the valuable information that could have been gleaned from his play down the stretch and in the playoffs. Indianapolis will also have to figure out how much to pay a player coming off a significant injury and whether Jones will even be ready by the start of next season.

On top of all that, it’s possible an even more desperate team could outbid the Colts for Jones’ services.

Indianapolis certainly seemed committed to its current build around Jones, so much so that in November it traded first-round picks in 2026 and 2027 for cornerback Sauce Gardner, who missed the loss to Jacksonville with a calf injury. That means that even if the Colts wanted an option to move on from Jones in the near future, they won’t be able to draft a quarterback in the first round until 2028 unless they make another trade.

How to move forward will be a series of high-stakes decisions for Indianapolis. The best-case scenario, almost regardless of what happens the rest of this year, is for Jones to come back in time for next season and resemble the player he was for much of 2025.

So we’re going to exhaust all of our resources in and outside of the building to make sure we’re addressing it and doing what we can to get him back and healthy again.”

Rivers, who last played for the Colts five years ago, was coaching high school football in Alabama.

The Colts are turning to Rivers due to a lack of available quarterback options late in the season.

For the second time in franchise history, the Colts are turning to Philip Rivers for stability at quarterback.

Indianapolis is signing Rivers to the practice squad, a league source confirmed to IndyStar on Tuesday, one day after the Chargers legend turned 44 and five years after he spent his final season leading the Colts to the playoffs, the franchise’s last postseason appearance.

The move is a shot in the dark, but the situation is dire in Indianapolis.

Indianapolis, at 8-5, has a chance to break its playoff drought, but the team’s chances dropped precipitously in the franchise's latest loss at Jacksonville on Sunday, and only a little because the Colts fell 36-19.

Starting quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a torn Achilles tendon early in the game, and backup Riley Leonard — only in the No. 2 role because backup quarterback Anthony Richardson is on injured reserve — emerged from his first extended action with a knee injury that didn’t fully reveal itself until Monday morning.

Few NFL teams can withstand the loss of their starting quarterback.

The Colts lost their top three in early December, a date so late on the NFL calendar that almost all of the available options are already playing elsewhere. Indianapolis could try to pry a quarterback off a practice squad, but any practice-squad quarterback is already in a No. 3 role for a reason, and a player can choose to stay with his current team.

For example, former Colts backup Sam Ehlinger reportedly turned down two offers from other teams to join their 53-man roster after he was cut in August, according to ESPN, preferring to stay in Denver. It is not known if Indianapolis tried to get Ehlinger back at any point this season, either after Richardson was injured in October or during the decision-making process that led to Rivers this week.

With all three quarterbacks out and only veteran Brett Rypien on the practice squad, Indianapolis decided to break the glass in case of emergency, calling Rivers a little more than a week after the high school football team he coaches in Fairhope, Ala., lost to Jackson in a state semifinal.

Five years after he last played in the NFL, it’s anybody’s guess how Rivers will play if given the opportunity.

The Colts ultimately decided he was better than any other option available and convinced Rivers to come back.

Rivers remains close with Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen, a friend and confidant from their Chargers days, and he made a strong impression on the Colts in the one season he spent in Indianapolis.

Rivers turned in the best season of any Colts starting quarterback since Andrew Luck in 2020, completing 68% of his passes for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, 7.7 yards per attempt and a 97.0 quarterback rating while leading Indianapolis to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth.

Former Colts head coach Frank Reich publicly said he wanted Rivers back for a second season in Indianapolis after the team's 27-24 loss to Buffalo in the wild card round. Rivers initially wasn't sure, and although general manager Chris Ballard told the then-39-year-old that both sides should take a month to decide, Rivers retired a couple of weeks later.

Rivers always wanted to coach his sons in high school, the same way his father coached him at Athens High in Alabama. A father of 10, Rivers has three sons, and the oldest, Gunner, is now a four-star prospect in the class of 2027, Rivers' quarterback at St. Michael Catholic

But he kept the possibility of playing in the NFL alive. While committed to St. Michael Catholic, Rivers has talked to teams about playing in an emergency capacity before; San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan has acknowledged that Rivers would have quarterbacked the 49ers in the Super Bowl in 2023 if they had somehow beaten the Eagles in the NFC Championship Game despite every quarterback on the roster dealing with injury.

Indianapolis is in that position now.

Leonard, the team's first choice to start with Jones and Richardson unavailable, is dealing with a right knee injury, and it was unclear early in the week if the rookie would be available against Seattle this weekend.

Rivers has already been a mentor to Leonard. Leonard trained with Rivers in Fairhope, Ala., before playing the 2024 season with Notre Dame and again before the NFL Draft last summer, and the two have a strong bond, a lot like the one Rivers has formed with Steichen and the rest of the Colts front office.

If Leonard cannot go on Sunday, Rivers is an option to start against a Seahawks defense that ranks in the top 10 in almost every major category, although Rypien is another option.

Presumably, Rivers wouldn't have come out of retirement -- and potentially delayed his Hall of Fame candidacy; he was eligible for the first time in 2025 -- to sit.

G Davion Mitchell is currently listed as probable due to a groin injury and is expected to play. It is worth noting that Mitchell did miss Miami’s most recent game against the Sacramento Kings on Saturday as he was dealing with groin tightness.

As the team’s starting point guard, Mitchell has been an integral part of the Heat’s offense since being acquired by the franchise in the trade that sent Jimmy Butler to the Golden State Warriors last February.

Let’s take a closer look at Mitchell’s injury update tonight and check out some key stats and PrizePicks picks for the rest of the Heat’ players, including Tyler Herro.

Davion Mitchell Injury Update vs. Magic Tonight

Mitchell practices with the Heat on Monday prior to the team's four-game road trip that begins with Tuesday’s NBA Cup quarterfinal matchup.

The Baylor product is currently listed as probable, which means that he’ll likely suit up.

However, Mitchell did miss Saturday’s 127-111 loss vs. the Sacramento Kings due to groin tightness and his presence was sorely missed. The former first-round pick serves as Miami’s starting point guard and the Heat were forced to play Dru Smith in that spot against Sacramento.

In 23 starts this season, Mitchell is averaging 9.7 points and a team-high 7.8 assists. He also has become known for his defensive acumen.

Target Tyler Herro If Davion Mitchell Is Out?

It appears that all signs are pointing towards Mitchell playing in Tuesday’s NBA Cup quarterfinal matchup. However, just in case he suffers a setback, there are other Heat players that could see increased production if he were to miss the contest.

Much like Mitchell, G Tyler Herro has been a little banged up as of late. In fact, Herro is also listed as probable for Tuesday’s game due to a toe injury.

Herro, who shares the Miami backcourt with Mitchell, also missed the first month of the season with an ankle injury, but has thrived since returning. In five games since rejoining the team, Herro is averaging 23.8 points and 4.6 rebounds, while shooting a staggering 48.4% from three.

Herro is coming off a performance in which he scored 20 points on 8-of-17 shooting and grabbed four rebounds in a 118-108 loss vs. the Dallas Mavericks on Dec. 3. He sat out the ensuing two games, but looks to be ready to make his return on Tuesday.

Make Tuesday NBA Picks on PrizePicks

The Heat are a bit banged up and Davion Mitchell is nursing a groin injury ahead of Tuesday’s NBA Cup quarterfinal matchup against the Magic.

Even if Mitchell suffers a setback, there are plenty of Heat player picks to consider on PrizePicks to win real money if you're right, including Tyler Herro.

“(The pain) got probably progressively worse after the game, and so I’m appreciative of our medical experts.","Derrick Harmon is not the only Pittsburgh Steelers starter about who coach Mike Tomlin believes “certainly has got a chance this week to come back” from injury. Veteran safety Kyle Dugger also could, as well, after he did not play in this past Sunday’s win at the Baltimore Ravens.

As is his unofficial policy, Tomlin declined to speculate on the status of players in NFL concussion protocol, of which this week the Steelers have three who left the victory against the Ravens: fill-in left tackle Andrus Peat, inside linebacker Malik Harrison and tight end Darnell Washington.

Peat was the third left tackle to play in a three-game span; Broderick Jones (neck) is on injured reserve and Calvin Anderson (knee) is out again this week. Fourth-string Dylan Cook remains on the practice squad but is the next man up if Peat is not cleared.

Tomlin said cornerback James Pierre (calf) and wide receiver Ben Skowronek (finger) will be limited at practice early in the week but should be able to play against the Dolphins.

Metcalf ‘fine’

Tomlin said that No. 1 receiver DK Metcalf is “moving in the right direction” after a stomach ailment compelled the team to leave him behind a night in Baltimore instead of taking off on the team plane home.

Metcalf got evaluated at a Baltimore hospital but was released and returned to Pittsburgh on Monday.

“I don’t think it’s going to jeopardize his (game) availability at all, but it certainly may jeopardize his availability at the early portions of the week from a practice standpoint,” Tomlin said. “But thankfully, he’s fine. I’m appreciative of our medical staff and how quickly they acted in making sure that he was safe and taking care of him post-game.”

Tomlin said Metcalf sustained a hit in the abdominal area and during the game was given some over-the-counter stomach remedies.

“Like Pepto, or something like that,” Tomlin said. “(The pain) got probably progressively worse after the game, and so I’m appreciative of our medical experts. We just exercised an abundance of precaution. We didn’t want to get him in the air without having a complete understanding about what he was dealing with, and they did a good job of that.”",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/12/9113783_web1_ptr-Tomlin01-120225.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 06:58:48.405795

He will reportedly join the Colts for practices ahead of Sunday's game at Seattle.

Quarterback Daniel Jones tore his right Achilles in Sunday's defeat at Jacksonville and will have season-ending surgery.

Third-string Riley Leonard, the only quarterback listed on the Colts' depth chart, suffered a knee injury after replacing Jones.

Indianapolis were already without prior backup signal-caller, Anthony Richardson, who suffered an orbital fracture in October.

Rivers will work with Leonard, a rookie taken in the sixth round of this year's NFL Draft, but also learn the Colts schemes with an eye to possibly playing on Sunday, according to the reports.

Only four quarterbacks in NFL history have started a game at age 44 or older -- seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg.

The Colts (8-5) are one spot out of the AFC playoffs but will be tested in the final weeks of the campaign by Seattle (10-3), San Francisco (9-4), Jacksonville (9-4) and Houston (8-5).

Rivers, who has never played in a Super Bowl, spent 16 seasons with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers before playing his final year with the Colts in 2020.

Indy went 11-5 that season and reached the playoffs, a feat the Colts have not achieved since.

Rivers, who has been serving as a high school football coach, has not thrown an NFL pass since January 2021.

He signed a one-day contract with the Chargers last July so he could retire as a member of that team.

Rivers is a friend of Colts head coach Shane Steichen. They spent six seasons together when Steichen was an assistant coach for the Chargers.

QB Daniel Jones

Torn Achilles: Out for the year

Jones’ 2025 season has come to an end, unfortunately. He tore his right Achilles tendon on Sunday against Jacksonville and is now out for the year after undergoing surgery. The injury comes at a very difficult time as Jones is not under contract next year. He’ll be a free agent who will be rehabbing all off-season, making it a pretty challenging task to learn a new offense/adapt to a new scheme if he ends up leaving Indy. Either way, Jones has a chance to be ready for the start of next year, but he won’t be anywhere near 100% in the opening month. This is also his right leg, which is problematic for a right handed QB as that right leg is used to drive forward during the throwing motion. That could easily impact is downfield accuracy and power. To make matters worse for Indy, Anthony Richardson remains on IR (orbital bone fracture) and rookie Riley Leonard left last week’s game with a PCL sprain in his knee. The team is working out 44 year old Philip Rivers (Pee River!) and has Brett Rypien Farts on the practice squad.

Players impacted: Jonathan Taylor, Michael Pittman, Alec Pierce, Tyler Warren

QB Tyrod Taylor

Groin Strain: Doubtful for Week 15

Tyrod left in the first quarter Sunday with a groin injury and did not return. He could theoretically play this week as a strict pocket passer, but we should expect minimal to no mobility as a scrambler, which is a big component of Tyrod’s game. If he can’t play, it would in theory be Justin Fields under center, but Fields was inactive this past week due to a knee injury (unclear on diagnosis). As a result, it was rookie Brady Cook who entered in relief of Taylor. Needless to say, the Jets have major QB issues ahead of their Week 15 tilt with the Jags.

Players impacted: Justin Fields/Brady Cook

QB Jayden Daniels

Left Elbow Soreness: Questionable for Week 15

Daniels returned to the lineup this week for his first start since dislocating his left elbow back in Week 9. Unfortunately, after throwing an INT, he was pushed to the ground by a defensive player and landed on that left elbow. Daniels was in obvious pain and was evaluated in the medical tent but did not return. Dan Quinn confirmed that Daniels could have entered the game if it were close, choosing to hold him out as a precaution given the score was already out of hand when the injury occurred. The good news here is that the elbow was not necessarily “re-injured” per se. This is more of a soreness/pain issue rather than a new injury. Still, you’d have to think the Commanders take a long look at this situation and decide whether or not they want to put him back out there given the state of their season. It wouldn’t be surprising to see the team exercise caution with their young QB, so it could certainly be Marcus Mariota this week. If Daniels does play, he’ll continue to wear the brace on his left elbow.

Players impacted: Marcus Mariota, Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel

QB Geno Smith

Right Shoulder Injury: Week-to-week

Geno was initially evaluated for a right hand laceration but later left the game a second time because of a right shoulder injury. He landed hard on that right shoulder while being taken to the turf by a Bronco defender, which caused the injury. Fortunately, Pete Carroll said there is no “structural damage” to Geno’s shoulder, but you could see the training staff working on is shoulder and neck on the sideline. He’s likely going to miss practice reps this week, and given the state of the Raiders’ season, it’s possible we see the team give a look to Kenny Pickett.

Players impacted: Kenny Pickett, Brock Bowers

RB DeVon Achane

Rib Injury: Likely to play in Week 15

Achane exited in the first half against the Jets with a rib injury after falling on the football and did not return. X-rays and an MRI showed no rib fractures, so this is a situation where Achane is likely more “hurt than injured.” The team remains optimistic that Achane can play in Week 15, and I am as well. He might play with a flak jacket and/or a pre-game injection if necessary, but I do expect him out there on Monday night. The extra day of rest/treatment should help.

Players impacted: Jaylen Wright, Ollie Gordon

RB Nick Chubb

Rib Injury: Questionable for Week 15

Chubb left Sunday night’s game early with a rib injury and did not return, which resulted in Woody Marks getting a ton of work as the bell cow. I haven’t seen any updates on Chubb’s status as of early Tuesday morning, so we’ll have to monitor the Texans’ injury report ahead of Week 15. For now, consider him Questionable for their game against the Cardinals.

Players impacted: Woody Marks

WR CeeDee Lamb

Concussion Protocol: Questionable for Week 15

Lamb left last Thursday’s game against the Lions with a concussion and did not return. As of Tuesday he remains in the protocol, so we’ll need to track his status throughout the week. Fortunately, the extra few days should help Lamb have a chance to return to action this week, but of course, the progression through protocol is symptom based, not time based. Hopefully, he can at least get in an LP on Wednesday.

Players impacted: Dak Prescott, George Pickens, Jake Ferguson

WR Tee Higgins

Concussion Protocol: Likely out for the year

Higgins missed a game a couple of weeks ago because of a concussion, and on Sunday against Buffalo in his return, his hit his head on the frozen ground multiple times. During the game, he cleared protocol, but on Monday, Zac Taylor told the media that Higgins is now back in the protocol after reporting symptoms following the game. Repeat head injuries in a short amount of time tends to lead to a longer recovery, and these second-insult injuries can have long term ramifications. Cincinnati cannot afford to have Tee pick up a third head injury this season, and with the Bengals now essentially out of playoff contention, I see them taking the long-view with their star WR. I expect him to miss multiple games, and given that it’s already Week 15, it would make sense to put him on IR and keep him out for the remainder of the season.

Players impacted: Ja’Marr Chase, Joe Burrow, Mike Gesicki

TE Zach Ertz

Right Knee ACL+ Injury: Out for the year

It’s been an awesome career for Ertz, but sadly, his 2025 season has come to an end after he suffered a complex right knee injury. A defender hit the front of his knee, causing a hyper-extension injury. It’s already been confirmed that Ertz tore his ACL, but this is one of those injuries where you worry about additional damage, particularly to the PCL. Given the multi-ligament injury, Ertz is not going to be anywhere close to 100% in the first two months of next season. It’s certainly possible that this injury is career threatening just given where he’s at in his NFL journey.

Players impacted: Jayden Daniels/Marcus Mariota, Deebo Samuel, Terry McLaurin

TE David Njoku

Left Knee PCL Sprain: Likely to miss multiple weeks, could land on IR

Njoku injured his knee while catching a TD pass on Sunday against the Titans. He landed hard on the front of his left knee with the knee flexed, which is the classic mechanism of injury for a PCL sprain. Even if this is a mild sprain, Njoku is going to miss multiple games, and given where we are in the calendar, he could land on IR and be done for the season. I do not expect this injury to impact him deep into the off-season or in 2026.",https://s26212.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Daniel-Jones-Achilles.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 04:58:00.717345

Yet he remained in the game.

Now, a joint statement from the NFLPA and the NFL tape you see here says T. Higgins was evaluated twice and cleared to play Return after the game.

In discussion with club medical personnel.

Part of a postgame evaluation, he notified the team he was experiencing symptoms and was Immediately placed in the concussion protocol.

I don't understand what's wrong with the protocol they took after the game to Figure it out.

We all saw it.

And this is the world that we now live in, where there are a million cameras watching every Single play in every football game.

That's why immediate review is so crucial.

Huge part of how NFL games are broadcast now, because they realized fans at home We were seeing something that the refs needed to be aware of.

At what point do we also acknowledge that fans at home saw T. Higgins repeatedly.

Grab his head.

We saw T. Higgins repeatedly point to it.

We saw a violent hit on the sidelines where his head bounced off the ground in the minute he Sat up, he grabbed his helmet.

Now, he stayed in the game; every time they, They checked him; they cleared him.

And I dont know what the protocol is.

Allowed him to get back in the game because to me, it seems fishy at best.

And for so many of us, Im the farthest thing from a conspiracy theorist, So many of us will look at it, though, and say, Well, why was he back in the game?

My question is, what's wrong with the protocol that we all saw him physically react Multiple times, hits to the head where his head bounced off the ground.

We all saw it.

We saw his hands; we saw him reach for his head.

What is wrong with the protocol we all saw This happened in real time, and nothing was caught Until after the game?

The most important thing here is T. Higgins Get healthy.

And once you've had multiple concussions, This short proximity, suddenly we're gonna wonder about your health moving forward.

Those are all fair questions to ask.

The most important thing we want is for T Higgins is getting healthy now.

But also on top of all that, The NFL needs to look in the mirror this offseason and figure out what's wrong Their protocol, that somebody so clearly bothered, was examined multiple times, An independent neurologist allowed him to come back in the game.

Again, I'm not screaming conspiracy theory.

“I don’t think it’s going to jeopardize his availability at all,” Tomlin said.

Eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback Philip Rivers ended his retirement and signed with the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad today in a surprise move for the 44-year-old. Rivers last played an NFL game for the Colts on Jan. 9, 2021 in a wild-card loss to the Buffalo Bills.

The Colts started the season 8-2 before their Week 11 bye. They've dropped three games in a row since and lost starting quarterback Daniel Jones to a season-ending Achilles injury against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 14.

To add injury to injury, third-string quarterback Riley Leonard also suffered a knee injury during Week 14 when he entered the game for Jones.

It's unclear whether Rivers will get the start in Week 15 against the Tennessee Titans. He worked out for the team yesterday and ""threw the ball well"" on his 44th birthday. If Leonard isn't able to go, the Colts may rely on Rivers - who is in his first year as a Hall of Fame semifinalist.

With a start, he'd be the latest notable quarterback to un-retire and take the field once again. Here are three examples of that happening in the last 20 years:

NFL QBs to come out of retirement

Teddy Bridgewater

The former first-round pick spent the first four years of his career in Minnesota with the Vikings before bouncing around to New Orleans (2018-19), Carolina (2020), Denver (2021), Miami (2022) and Detroit (2023). After his lone season with the Lions, Bridgewater decided to hang up his cleats in December of that season.

He spent a calendar year away from the NFL and won a state championship with his alma mater, Miami Northwestern High School, before reuniting with the Lions late in the 2024 season. Detroit was hit hard by injuries all year and Bridgewater came on as veteran insurance at the most important position.

He's stuck around, though, and is currently the backup in Tampa Bay for Baker Mayfield.

Tom Brady

The future Pro Football Hall of Famer flirted briefly with retirement in February 2022 after a second season with the Buccaneers. It wasn't for a drop-off in performance; he'd set a career-high in passing yards with 5,316 and led the NFL in touchdowns with 43 in 2021.

His retirement was ultimately short-lived. Brady needed just 40 days to decide he wanted back in and returned to the Buccaneers for the 2022 NFL season. His return wasn't as triumphant as the previous two years; Tampa Bay went 8-9, giving him his lone losing season as a starter in the NFL. Brady retired again - this time for good - in February 2023 and transitioned immediately to the broadcast booth.

Brett Favre

NFL fans under the age of 27 may not remember the annual offseason drama that was Favre's retirement decision. The three-time MVP and Hall of Famer mulled retirement on a yearly basis in the late 2000s. His future was in doubt after the 2006 season but he ultimately returned to the Green Bay Packers for the 2007 season. On March 4, 2008, he retired for the first time.

Four months later, he wanted to return to the team but Green Bay did not grant him an unconditional release. The Packers eventually traded him to the New York Jets for a 2009 draft pick. Favre led he league in interceptions and went 9-7 as a starter.

He had a resurgent season in 2009 with the Minnesota Vikings. He nearly made the Super Bowl, falling in the NFC championship game to the eventual champion Saints on a late interception. Favre returned in 2010 and went 5-8 as a starter before officially filing his retirement papers in January 2011.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/09/USAT/87690934007-usatsi-15453184.jpg?crop=4262,2398,x0,y319&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 00:59:54.215764

But they're also in the midst of a four-game stretch against teams fighting for postseason position.

On Sunday, Dec. 14, the Packers travel to Denver to face the Broncos, owners of the best record in the AFC (11-2) after defeating the Las Vegas Raiders last week.

Like the Packers, the Broncos are battling for the top seed in their conference with the New England Patriots, who are also 11-2. Denver has won 10 straight games, its longest winning streak since it won the Super Bowl with Peyton Manning in 2012.

However, oddsmakers are apparently more impressed with the Packers. They opened as 2.5-point favorites on the road. Part of the reason might be that eight of the Broncos' 10 victories in their streak have come by one score or less and six have been by three points or less.

The Packers and Broncos have two of the better defenses in the NFL, with the Packers allowing 285 yards a game and 24 touchdowns and the Broncos allowing 296 yards a game and 20 touchdowns.

Packers injury update

Wide receiver Jayden Reed and linebacker Quay Walker returned to action against the Bears. Reed finished with four catches for 31 yards.

Wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks, who's battling an ankle injury, is day-to-day, according to coach Matt LaFleur.

Wicks should have a chance to test his ankle this week before the team decides whether he can play in Denver.

“We’ll see how he progresses,” LaFleur said, “but certainly we need him out there. He’s a guy who, you can see it early in the routes that he was running, there was one in particular – it might’ve been the first play of the game – where (Bears cornerback) Jaylon Johnson is pressed on him, and his ability to get a guy to move off the spot is pretty impressive.”
