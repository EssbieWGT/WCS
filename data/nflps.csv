""I'd say definitely not taking hits on it last week was probably pretty helpful,"" Herbert said.
One of the biggest issues for Herbert since the injury has been taking snaps under center and gripping the football with his left hand.
But for the first time since the injury, Herbert took under-center snaps Wednesday, the earliest in a game week he has done that since the fracture.

Herbert, who suffered a fractured left hand in Week 13, said sitting out of last week's game against Denver for precautionary reasons proved beneficial.

""I'd say definitely not taking hits on it last week was probably pretty helpful,"" Herbert said. ""It limited kind of the swelling and just getting back to making sure that you have got full strength, being able to hold onto a football.""

One of the biggest issues for Herbert since the injury has been taking snaps under center and gripping the football with his left hand. While injured, he typically avoided those during the week, opting to take a few on Saturdays and on game days. But for the first time since the injury, Herbert took under-center snaps Wednesday, the earliest in a game week he has done that since the fracture.

""I would say that I was able to do most everything out there,"" Herbert said of Wednesday's practice. ""It's just making sure I can grip on the ball and have two hands on it in the pocket. ... So I think that's been good.""

It was just over a year ago that Herbert and the Chargers clinched a playoff spot on the road with a 40-7 beatdown of New England -- only the Patriots' second home loss by 30-plus points this century. Herbert threw for 238 yards and three touchdowns, and rookie wide receiver Ladd McConkey had eight catches for 94 yards and two touchdowns.

That Patriots team, which was 4-13, bears little resemblance to this season's version, which has had one of the league's most surprising turnarounds under first-year coach Mike Vrabel. New England is 14-3 this season, earned the AFC's No. 2 seed and enters the postseason riding a three-game win streak.

For that reason, Herbert said last season's game film isn't very helpful.

""They're not the same team they were last year,"" Herbert said. ""... You turn on the tape and you see a completely different team.""

The Chargers could be heading into this game without one of their most important players. Running back Omarion Hampton, nursing an ankle injury, sat out practice Wednesday and didn't practice all of last week.

""He's doing everything and anything he can to get back,"" coach Jim Harbaugh said.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1230%2Fr1594901_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-08 03:59:28.309531

""This week has been pretty good. Running around, moving around,"" Hunt stated. ""Obviously, it's not the game. We're not in camp, so it'll be a little different to tell from that standpoint.

""But moving around good, the body feels good, I'm kinda quick on my feet. So that's good. I feel good. If I get the opportunity, I'll be ready.""

Defensive lineman Bobby Brown III and cornerback Robert Rochell, both of whom sustained concussions in Week 18's loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, were also listed as full participants. Brown and Rochelle were down as limited on Tuesday.

Cross, 25, was already under contract through 2026 because the Seahawks exercised his fifth-year option earlier in the season.

“I feel great just being in Seattle, being around my teammates, the organization here,” Cross said.

The contract runs through the 2030 season and includes $75 million guaranteed, according to multiple reports. Cross, 25, was already under contract through 2026 because the Seahawks exercised his fifth-year option earlier in the season.

“It means a lot to me,” Cross said Wednesday. “This team, this organization, I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. This place is definitely special, and I believe that and everyone in this building.”

The Seahawks selected Cross in the first round of the 2022 NFL draft with a pick they acquired when they traded Russell Wilson. Cross has started 62 games, including 14 this season for the Seahawks, who are the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs.

“I feel great just being in Seattle, being around my teammates, the organization here,” Cross said.

Cross missed the last three games of the regular season with a hamstring injury, which he said happened during Jason Myers’ game-winning field goal against Indianapolis on Dec. 14. Cross practiced Wednesday and is expected to be back for the playoffs.

The Seahawks received a first-round bye and will host the lowest remaining seed on the weekend of Jan. 17-18, giving Cross plenty of time to get back to full strength.

“I feel like it’ll help me a lot,” Cross said, “just being able to recover and get the reps, get more reps in and refine what I’ve been working on.”

Johnson was diagnosed with a Lisfranc sprain in his right foot, which forced him to sit out the latter part of the regular season for the Eagles. The six-time Pro Bowler, however, has been working hard behind the scenes to get himself ready for the NFL playoffs, and it appears that Johnson is finally set to reap the rewards of his labor.

Johnson was an integral part of the Eagles’ championship run last season, and they will need him healthy in the playoffs this year as they look to defend their crown.

The good news for the Eagles is that Johnson is now trending in the right direction ahead of Sunday’s wild-card matchup against the San Francisco 49ers. The team announced on Wednesday that Johnson finally returned to practice after an extended absence.

The last time Johnson practiced was in mid-November before he suffered his midfoot injury. The fact that he was able to practice on Wednesday, albeit in a limited capacity, is a significant step toward his recovery and his potential comeback for Sunday’s big game.

The Eagles practice again on Thursday and Friday, and Johnson’s status for those sessions will be worth monitoring. It would only make sense that the 35-year-old is able to turn in at least one full practice before he’s given the green light to suit up on Sunday against the Niners.

Another crucial development for the Eagles is Jalen Carter’s return to practice. The two-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle missed four out of the last five games due to shoulder and hip injuries, but he, too, is making significant progress ahead of the wild-card showdown on Sunday.

Johnson, who suffered a Lisfranc sprain against the Detroit Lions on Nov. 16, practiced for the first time on Jan. 7 since suffering the injury in preparation for the Eagles' wildcard playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers on Jan. 11.

In addition, five other starters held out of the Eagles' 24-17 loss to the Commanders on Jan. 4 all returned to practice as well. They are DT Jalen Carter (hip), TE Dallas Goedert (knee), LB Nakobe Dean (hamstring), DE Jaelan Phillips (ankle) and S Marcus Epps (concussion).

Phillips was listed as a full participant, while Johnson, Carter, Dean, Goedert, Epps and Johnson were listed as limited on the Eagles' first injury report of the week. The only players who didn't practice were backups injured against Washington. They are TE Grant Calcaterra (knee/ankle) and OL Brett Toth (concussion).

Before the Jan. 7 practice, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni raved about Johnson, who's in his 13th season and considered one of the top tackles in the NFL.

Sirianni called Johnson ""a difference maker."" That effusive praise could indicate that Sirianni is expecting Johnson, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, to return against the 49ers.

""Obviously, Lane’s a big difference maker,"" Sirianni said. ""I know he’s working like crazy to get himself back. We’ll see where that is this week. But he’s a difference-maker. He’s one of the best who’s ever done it.""

Fred Johnson has replaced Lane Johnson at right tackle for the past seven games. The Eagles have gone 3-4 this season without Lane Johnson. That was a snapshot of the vast disparity in the Eagles' record when Lane Johnson plays versus when he does not over his 13-year career.

The Eagles are 110-57-1 when Lane Johnson plays, a winning percentage of .658. They're 18-27 when the 35-year-old does not play, a winning percentage of .400.

It's easy to see why, although Sirianni wouldn't divulge those reasons because of ""scheme."" Basically, the Eagles don't need to provide help when Johnson is at right tackle, and that frees up other aspects of how the Eagles block.

That can open up running room for Saquon Barkley, and provide more time for quarterback Jalen Hurts to pass, or run himself.

""He allows you to do some different things,"" Sirianni said about Lane Johnson. ""Again, Fred has done a nice job when he came in and played for him. We won a lot of games with Fred in the lineup.

""Lane is just a difference-maker. And it can affect everything. There’s a reason he’s going to the Hall of Fame. There’s a reason he’s going to be in the Eagles Hall of Fame, the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He’s one of the best ever to do it at that position.

,,2026-01-08 01:01:39+00:00,The Athletic,"Rangers insider: What I'm hearing about Fox, Shesterkin injuries, U.S. Olympic decisions",Vincent Z. Mercogliano,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6945769/2026/01/07/rangers-usa-olympics-roster-adam-fox/,"Soon after, he had individual conversations with Sullivan and Drury, who, the source said, had kept him informed throughout the process.
What came out of nowhere was a text indicating Fox was the one being placed on LTIR with a lower-body injury.
Even at full strength — something we haven’t seen very often this season — this team has clearly hit a wall.
“I think that I play with an edge and a competitiveness that can help win hockey games — and meaningful hockey games,” Trocheck said.
It’s probably a combination of the two, which calls into question whether Rempe should have taken more time to heal.","TARRYTOWN, N.Y. — I spent a good chunk of Tuesday’s off day working on this column, which included information on the fallout from Adam Fox missing the cut for the U.S. Olympic team.

I wrote that New York Rangers coach Mike Sullivan, team president Chris Drury and assistant coach David Quinn — all members of the American staff in some capacity — went to bat for Fox but were overruled by U.S. general manager Bill Guerin, according to a league source who was granted anonymity so they could speak freely about a sensitive issue. Fox heard the news directly from Guerin following last week’s 6-3 loss to the Washington Capitals, I was told, receiving the call shortly before the Rangers took off for the Winter Classic in Miami. Soon after, he had individual conversations with Sullivan and Drury, who, the source said, had kept him informed throughout the process. Another source who was briefed on the situation indicated the bulk of Fox’s ire was directed at Guerin, while admitting it’s hard not to wonder how the snub will affect his relationship with New York brass.

A few hours later, it all became an afterthought.

We had been anticipating news on goalie Igor Shesterkin, who sustained a lower-body injury during Monday’s 3-2 overtime loss to the Utah Mammoth and was unable to put weight on his left leg in a deflating scene at Madison Square Garden. It turns out he’s being placed on injured reserve, which beats the alternative of long-term IR, but a league source cautioned that we shouldn’t jump to any conclusions about a short absence. More time will be required to determine a potential return date.

What came out of nowhere was a text indicating Fox was the one being placed on LTIR with a lower-body injury. I responded by asking if that was a typo.

I noticed when Fox didn’t take the ice for the first shift of Monday’s OT but figured he was gassed and we’d see him on the next one. It never made it that far, with Utah defenseman Sean Durzi scoring the winner 1:06 in.

There was no obvious collision or incident, but from what I can gather, Fox felt something on a shift that ended with 59 seconds left in regulation. By Tuesday morning, the condition had worsened.

The surprising LTIR move puts the 27-year-old defenseman on the shelf for a minimum of 10 games and 24 days, making his earliest possible return date Jan. 31 in Pittsburgh. That’s the second-to-last game before the Olympic break, and while the injury isn’t considered season-threatening, there’s at least a chance we won’t see Fox again until late February or March if they play it conservatively. It almost surely rules him out as a potential injury replacement for Team USA.

As for the Rangers, I already wrote that missing Shesterkin for any length of time should serve as a nudge for Drury to go into sell mode. Fox’s injury only amplifies that message.

Even at full strength — something we haven’t seen very often this season — this team has clearly hit a wall. The Rangers entered Tuesday last in the Eastern Conference in points percentage (.523) and goals per game (2.59), with only two regulation wins in their last 15 games.

There are no Band-Aids or quick fixes for a roster that’s already proven to be too slow (as we saw again versus the Mammoth), too reliant on its goaltending (which just took a major hit) and severely lacking offensive punch (which suffers in a big way without Fox, especially on the power play). They were clinging to hope for a second-half rally, but that has been dashed now that they’re without their two best players for an undetermined amount of time.

Delaying the inevitable would threaten to set the Rangers back even further. Owner James Dolan went on WFAN Radio on Monday and preached patience while affirming his confidence in Drury, essentially giving the GM the green light to proceed as he sees fit. It’s time to take Dolan at his word and use the March 6 trade deadline to restock a bare cupboard with young players and draft picks.

Trocheck ‘not naive’ about his place on Team USA

In a video that was released by USA Hockey last week, Guerin was filmed calling each player who made the squad for the upcoming Olympics in Milan.

About four minutes in, Rangers center Vincent Trocheck can be heard on the other line saying, “Whatever you need, you know that.”

The inference was fairly obvious: The 32-year-old is willing to do any grunt work required to bring value to a team that had plenty of competition for the final few forward spots.

Trocheck is self-aware enough to recognize that some serious talent was left off the U.S. roster and sounded sympathetic to their plight while discussing his inclusion following Sunday’s practice.

“I’m not naive to the fact that I may not be the Auston Matthews, Jack Eichel, Jack Hughes type where I’m gonna dazzle with my skill and put up 100 points every year,” he told The Athletic from his locker at the MSG Training Center. “There were obviously some guys that were left off the list that have that in their game, and from a stats perspective, may have more points than (me). But I think the one thing that I was kind of falling back on and really hoping to make the team for was the intangibles that I bring.”

Guerin has repeatedly stressed the importance of building a complementary team rather than just a collection of all-stars, with Trocheck embodying that sentiment. He can’t match the production of Jason Robertson (24 goals and 25 assists through 42 games played) or Cole Caufield (20 goals and 20 assists through 42 games), who were both deserving in their own right. But Sullivan has referred to Trocheck as a “glue guy” who may be better suited as a checking fourth-liner or plug-and-play extra.

“I think that I play with an edge and a competitiveness that can help win hockey games — and meaningful hockey games,” Trocheck said. “At these types of tournaments, special teams go a long way. Being able to be on the penalty kill and do those types of things, I think, is part of the reason that I made the team.”

Another element that may be overlooked while picking names off the NHL leaderboard is cohesiveness.

Guerin, Sullivan and the U.S. leadership group believe the team they sent to last year’s 4 Nations Face-Off clicked on and off the ice, capturing a feeling of camaraderie that they wanted to tinker with as little as possible. That aided Trocheck’s case, as well as Rangers captain J.T. Miller.

“That’s something that a lot of the European teams have an advantage with, is that they get to play together so much more often, I feel like, and they have a ton of chemistry,” Trocheck said. “I think the teams are starting to realize that is a factor. If you’re able to keep guys comfortable and familiar with guys that they play with, in a short tournament like this where you have to get together and get ready for the games (quickly), I think that goes a certain distance.”

Perreault focused on ‘subtleties’

When it comes to the progress of top prospect Gabe Perreault, Sullivan is focused on what he described as “subtleties.”

He and the Rangers coaching staff firmly believe in the 20-year-old forward’s playmaking ability, but they’re closely monitoring how he looks away from the puck, on defense and in physical situations.

“One of his biggest strengths is his hockey IQ, and part of that process is figuring out how he could have success in those subtle circumstances that we’re talking about,” Sullivan explained Monday. “He’s an undersized guy. What strategies can he utilize to win wall battles on a breakout, on a rim, or puck battles in the corners? He’s not going to win pucks with physically overpowering people. He’s got to use his brain, his quickness, his stick skills. There’s an experiential learning process that he’s going through with respect to that. So I think Gabe is figuring it out, literally, with every game that he plays, and I think his hockey IQ is what’s going to allow him to do that.”

The Rangers initially valued allowing Perreault to work through those growing pains with AHL Hartford, where he’s appeared in 20 games so far this season, but the scoring deficiencies and mounting injuries of the NHL club necessitated two separate recalls. Sullivan thought he looked “overwhelmed” during his first stint in November, but he’s given the 5-foot-11, 180-pounder a longer runway since returning to New York in mid-December.

Perreault has appeared in eight of the last nine games, with mixed results. He carried a three-game point streak into Christmas break but looked a step behind against the speedy Mammoth.

He said the game is “starting to slow down,” but there’s a long way to go to reach the potential the Rangers see in their 2023 first-round pick. The key will be learning to navigate tight NHL ice and create enough space to let his offensive creativity take hold, which will require repetition and recognition. As Perreault put it, “You don’t really know what it’s like until you’re in it.”

“It’s kind of a mix of all those things: being more comfortable, more confident, knowing how to use your body and putting yourself in the right spot so you don’t get beat,” he added. “I’ve done that at every level. I’ve never been the biggest guy, so I was always kind of finding little ways to put myself in the right spot. I’m starting to figure that out.”

He’s recently been skating on a line with Trocheck and Alexis Lafrenière, with that trio producing a 61.27 percent expected goals-for rate, according to Natural Stat Trick. They hold a 13-4 advantage in high-danger scoring chances, but have yet to convert any into goals.

Perreault chalked some of that up to not “getting too lucky with our bounces,” which he believes will turn soon. He’s enjoyed playing with Lafrenière, with whom he relishes the chance to speak French, and lauded Trocheck as his locker-room mentor.

“Since I got here, he’s always kind of taking me under his wing and making sure I’m all good and talking to me a bunch,” he said. “Lucky enough, I’ve been playing with him, and I feel comfortable with him. He’s been really great since the start.”

Rempe ‘still has some limitations’

Early in Monday’s contest, Rangers forward Matt Rempe laid a big hit on Mammoth forward Kevin Stenlund and was immediately swarmed by Daniil But. A scrum ensued, but doctors have cautioned Rempe to avoid dropping the gloves as he continues to recover from left-thumb surgery.

It sounds like the 6-foot-9, 261-pounder may be restricted beyond just fighting.

“He still has some limitations,” Sullivan admitted following Sunday’s practice. “He’s still in the process of getting completely healthy.”

Rempe’s underlying numbers have been solid in 10 games since his return, with a 55.72 percent xGF that ranks fourth among Rangers forwards since Dec. 15. But he’s gone without a point in that span and hasn’t logged more than 9:16 time on ice in any contest. The 23-year-old was at 9:27 TOI or higher in every game before his injury, with the recent dip either a sign of Sullivan’s ongoing concern for the thumb or diminishing faith in his bottom six.

It’s probably a combination of the two, which calls into question whether Rempe should have taken more time to heal. It also speaks to the lack of depth and underwhelming alternatives throughout the organization.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/06150801/GettyImages-1470638235-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-08 00:01:17.014539

Odunze made the assertion and then slowly backed away from a full guarantee, considering coaches prefer to use uncertainty as a competitive advantage. No reason to get coach Ben Johnson angry right now. Odunze couched his claim, saying he has been planning to play for weeks.

But, if we’re reading between the lines here, it sure seems like, barring a setback, Odunze will play in the NFC wild-card round contest at Soldier Field.

The second-year pro has had setbacks before. He aggravated a stress fracture in his foot during pregame warmups prior to a Week 15 clash with the Cleveland Browns. The Bears essentially shut him down at that point and gave him a new target.

Work to be ready for the playoffs.

[READ: How Bears QB Caleb Williams evolved under Ben Johnson’s hard coaching]

“Everything’s been focused on that. Everything, honestly,” Odunze said after Wednesday’s practice. “All my energy, my focus, my attitude has been on that mark. Trying to get back as soon as possible. That was, like I said earlier, kind of changed to different weeks, time to time. When I got to an understanding with the training staff that this would be my benchmark, I put all my energy and effort into that. Excited for this week.”

Odzune missed five consecutive games with his foot injury, but he had been dealing with heel and ankle issues most of the season. That led to some lackluster totals for the Bears’ No. 1 receiver, with just 44 catches for 661 yards and six touchdowns. He was cruising to start the season, but the injuries sapped his effectiveness down the stretch.

He plans to be back now, when it matters most. It’s fair to wonder about how much he can contribute, considering his prolonged absences from games and practices. Odunze has worked on conditioning, but it’s impossible to remain in peak football shape after missing so much practice.

[READ: Ben Johnson, Bears captains define what’s required for NFL playoff success]

“I can definitely provide an asset to this offense,” Odunze said. “It’s tough being out for five weeks and having to be on the sideline and have all that happen and go through that, the ups and downs of the season and not being able to contribute. As long as I have the option to be out there and contribute, I’m going to give it my all. I believe I can make a difference.”

The Bears won’t expect him to assume his typical workload, where he rarely leaves the field. They’ve been fortunate to receive standout contributions from DJ Moore, Colston Loveland, Luther Burden III and Cole Kmet in Odunze’s absence.

[READ: How Luther Burden III has earned Bears’ trust, Caleb Williams’ targets]

Odunze, last year’s No. 9 overall draft pick, can make big plays for Chicago, as he has so many times this year. The coaching staff will formulate a plan for effective usage based upon how Odunze looks in practice.

“You don’t want to be giving him way too much, and yet, he’s a guy that can help us, and so we’ll be evaluating that over the next, you know, three days of practice, as we get to kind of finalize this plan and put that stuff together,” Bears offensive coordinator Declan Doyle said. “Anytime that he can be a part of it, certainly want to be able to use him and maximize the time that he’s out in the field and get him the ball, but really, it’s the same with all of our players. We always have plays for each guy specifically, and you know, we’re excited to have him back.”

[WATCH: The Chicago Football Show: Bears season 2.0 now begins]

Limitations should be expected but tolerated. Getting Odunze back on the field would be a huge boon for the Bears, as someone who must be respected by the Packers’ defense on every snap.

“I’m looking to be out there as much as possible,” Odunze said. “Make as many plays as I can. At the end of the day, it’s all or nothing for this game to make it to the Super Bowl until the end of the season. I want to contribute as much as possible and put everything that I have out there on the field. That’s my mentality.”",https://dupvhm5r1oaxt.cloudfront.net/uploads/2026/01/rome-odunze-bears-packers.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 20:00:21.708695

If the Eagles get both of them back for the wild-card round, it would be a huge boost going into the playoffs and the Eagles would likely have 21 of 22 starters available.

“Obviously, Lane is a big difference-maker,” head coach Nick Sirianni said on Wednesday morning. “I know he’s working like crazy to get himself back. We’ll see where that is this week. But he’s a difference-maker. He’s one of the best that’s ever done it.”

Johnson, 35, hasn’t played since suffering a Lisfranc sprain in his foot against the Lions on Nov. 16. He missed the final seven games of the regular season but the future Hall of Famer has been eyeing a return by the playoffs. Johnson made an appearance at Friday’s practice but did not participate.

It’s obvious that it would be a big boost for the Eagles’ offense to get Johnson back against the 49ers.

“Yeah, Lane's the best right tackle in the game, so if we get him back, it's tremendous,” offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo said. “He'll add so much to everything. Just even his leadership, his play-style ability, run-pass, doesn't matter. It'll be a tremendous lift for the whole entire offense and I think you'll feel the energy if he's out there.”

While the Eagles got a solid level of play from his backup Fred Johnson over the last month and a half, it would really help to get the starter back in the lineup. The Eagles in the regular season were 8-2 with Johnson at right tackle and were 3-4 without him.

And since the start of the 2016 season, here’s a look at the Eagles’ record with and without Johnson:

With Johnson: 94-41-1

Without Johnson: 15-27

It would also be a big boost for the Eagles’ defense to get Dean back. The Eagles’ starting middle linebacker suffered a hamstring injury against the Commanders in Week 16 and missed the final two weeks of the season.

On Tuesday, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said he expects Dean to play in this game.

Dean, 25, began the season on the PUP list after tearing his patellar tendon against the Packers in the wild-card round last season. He returned to the field in Week 6 and returned to the defense in Week 7. Since returning to the lineup, Dean had 55 tackles, 4 sacks, 2 forced fumbles, 7 TFLs and 6 QB hits.

In addition to Johnson and Dean, the Eagles also saw Marcus Epps (concussion) return to practice, along with Jalen Carter (hip), Dallas Goedert (knee) and Jaelan Phillips (ankle). The two notable players missing on Wednesday were OL Brett Toth (concussion) and Grant Calcaterra (knee/ankle).

But there’s looking like the Eagles will have 21 of 22 starters on Sunday against the 49ers. The only regular starter on IR is safety Andrew Mukuba, who suffered a fractured ankle in Dallas in late November.

The 49ers, meanwhile, are still a bit banged up heading into this wild-card round. A few key players were not participating in practice to start the week out there:

The two names on that list to watch closely this week are Trent Williams (hamstring) and Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle).

Calcaterra suffered knee and ankle injuries after being taken down with a hip drop tackle in the Eagles’ Week 18 game against the Washington Commanders. He is now listed with just an ankle injury. Not trying to be harsh but his absence could be a case of addition by subtraction since the Eagles try to run behind him and it typically doesn’t go well since he’s not a great blocker. If Calcaterra can’t play, the Eagles will have at least three active tight ends: Dallas Goedert, Kylen Granson, and Cameron Latu. If they want a fourth tight end, they can opt to temporarily elevate E.J. Jenkins from the practice squad.

Toth suffered a concussion in the Eagles’ Week 18 game. If he’s not able to at least return to practice in a limited capacity by Thursday, I’m thinking he won’t be able to play on Sunday. Toth is typically the top backup at guard and center, so, it remains to be seen how the team would replace him if applicable. They could go with Matt Pryor as the top backup at both guard spots and Drew Kendall at center. Or perhaps Kendall’s inexperience would prompt them to slide Landon Dickerson to center and put Pryor at left guard.

Johnson returned to practice for the first time since suffering a Lisfranc injury in Week 11. There were initially some conflicting reports on Johnson’s status for this weekend but then Brian Baldinger tweeted that Johnson WILL be playing. Of course, that tweet has since been deleted. But NFL insider Adam Schefter also sounded pretty sure Johnson will suit up. It sure seems like Johnson will at least try to give it a go … but we’ll see if he’s able to make it through the entire game, assuming he does play.

Dean told reporters that he is “definitely playing” on Sunday. The limited workload is likely about the Eagles helping him ease back in to practice after suffering a hamstring injury.

Goedert missed practice last week with a knee injury. The Eagles are probably ramping him up to get him to Sunday.

Epps suffered a concussion in practice last week. That he’s been upgraded to limited participation indicates he’s progressing towards a return. Barring any setbacks, he should be on track to start at safety against the 49ers.

Phillips didn’t get a true bye week this season since the Miami Dolphins traded him before they had one. The Eagles gave Phillips time off last week to allow him to get some of that much-needed rest. Now he’s back in full and ready to play.

Even without their captain and leading tackler on the field, Spillane continued to make his presence felt.

After returning to the practice field for the first time in weeks last Friday, New England’s top linebacker was back to work with the team on Wednesday in their first practice of wild card week.

Spillane, who did not play in team’s last four games with an ankle/foot injury, was always targeting a return for Sunday.

“No doubt,” Spillane said. “It was always a goal to be ready for Week 1 of the playoffs.”

The 30-year-old was first bothered by injury back in Week 13 when he played a season-low 39 snaps in a Monday night victory over the New York Giants. Following the team’s bye week, Spillane was then active in an emergency-only role in Week 15. After being spotted with a walking boot in the locker room, he was inactive for the final three weeks of the season.

“I’m feeling great,” Spillane said Wednesday. “To be a part of this moment is very special to me and I don’t take it lightly or for granted.”

In Spillane’s absence, New England relied primarily on linebackers Jack Gibbens and Christian Elliss. Even without their captain and leading tackler on the field, Spillane continued to make his presence felt.

“Rob’s been unbelievable all season and even since going down just as a leader, as someone to get advice from, to support us, to bring energy to the meeting rooms, to the practice field, on the sidelines [Sunday],” Gibbens said. “Just constantly talking to us and continuing to be that veteran presence that we need in our room and bring energy and support the guys. He’s been awesome.”

Returning for the playoffs, Spillane will now be tasked with helping New England’s defense slow down Justin Herbert and the Chargers offense. The the linebacker is confident he and his teammates will take advantage of the opportunity.

“You continue to work. You continue to trust the process. You focus on the details, the things that you need to do to have a great outcome on Sunday,” he said. “I think as a collection, as a group, I couldn’t be more proud of the confidence level, the focus level of the group.”",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/12/gettyimages-2245412327.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2026-01-07 20:00:38.059717

But now, as the Green Bay Packers return to Chicago for a wild-card playoff game with the Bears on Saturday, Jan. 10, they'll have their starting quarterback back.

Love is a full-go ahead of the playoffs after not playing the last 2½ games. And Packers coach Matt LaFleur is excited to see what his 27-year-old quarterback can do in the postseason.

""I’ve got a ton of confidence in him,"" LaFleur said Tuesday, Jan. 6. ""... I think that there’s nobody else I’d rather have than Jordan.""

Here's what to know about Love's playing status ahead of the playoffs:

Jordan Love injury update

He wasn't listed on the injury report Tuesday, Jan. 6 and is ready for another playoff run with the Packers.

Love actually cleared concussion protocol ahead of the Packers' Week 18 game against the Minnesota Vikings but LaFleur held him out, along with many of the team's starters, since Green Bay's playoff seed was already locked up.

Love was the backup to since-released third-stringer Clayton Tune in that game and only would have played in an emergency.

Buy Packers tickets on StubHub

Is Jordan Love playing vs Bears in playoffs?

Yes, Love is returning for the Packers against the Bears in the wild-card round of the playoffs on Saturday, Jan. 10.

It'll be his first action since his concussion on a helmet-to-helmet hit by Bears defensive end Austin Booker in the second quarter of the Packers' Week 16 game in Chicago, which ended with Green Bay collapsing in an 22-16 overtime loss. Love missed the team's Week 17 game against the Baltimore Ravens after not clearing the concussion protocol. He was active in the Week 18 game but, to avoid the chance of injury in what was a meaningless game, he didn't play.

This will be Love's fourth playoff game in three years as the starting quarterback. He's made the playoffs every season since taking over as the starter for Aaron Rodgers in 2023.

Jordan Love history in the playoffs

Love is 1-2 as a starter in the playoffs for the Packers, who have been the seventh seed in each of the last three years in the postseason.

Love hasn't had a home playoff game and won't again in 2025.

In his first playoff game two years ago, he led a surging Packers team into AT&T Stadium and torched the Dallas Cowboys, 48-32, in a wild-card game. He had three touchdown passes and a near-perfect passer rating. The Packers lost the next week in the divisional round to the San Francisco 49ers, 24-21, on a game that ended with Love throwing an interception as he looked to get the team in field-goal range.

In the playoffs last year, Love's three-interception performance was part of the Packers' dismal showing in a 22-10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/28/PMJS/87930466007-gan-20251227-rgo-sh-5-009.JPG?crop=4545,2558,x0,y73&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-07 18:01:27.058414

Tuesday, the Bills put in place a contingency plan in case Prater can’t recover as they signed kicker Matthew Wright to their practice squad.","ORCHARD PARK - The hits just keep coming for the injury-ravaged Buffalo Bills as they had to place defensive tackle Jordan Phillips on the injured reserve list Wednesday morning.

Phillips missed the Cleveland and Philadelphia games with an ankle injury, then played against New York last Sunday but apparently aggravated the injury to the point where he won’t be able to play in Sunday’s AFC wildcard game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

As for the rest of the injury report before the Bills took the field for their walk-through practice, coach Sean McDermott listed linebackers Matt Milano and Terrell Bernard, cornerback Maxwell Harrison, running back Ty Johnson and kicker Matt Prater as non-participants.

In the limited category, and remembering that in a walk-through everyone is essentially limited, McDermott listed tight end Dalton Kincaid, defensive tackle DaQuan Jones, safety Jordan Poyer, and linebacker Shaq Thompson. McDermott also said the team is opening safety Damar Hamlin’s 21-day practice window on Thursday.

Dane Jackson signed from practice squad

To fill Phillips’ spot on the 53-man roster, the Bills signed cornerback Dane Jackson off their practice squad, and that was necessary because rookie Hairston suffered an ankle injury against the Jets and McDermott has already said he won’t be able to play Sunday.

Jackson will be the primary backup for Christian Benford and Tre’Davious White, with White - who has been sharing his spot with Hairston - likely to play the full game.

“Dane’s always been a guy that’s done a great job for us,” McDermott said. “When he was first here, first came around, right away you notice the intangibles that Dane Jackson brings to the table - his toughness, his football instincts, his blue-collar approach, and he’s a great teammate. So it’s great to have someone like Dane that we can rely on in a situation like this.”

Without Phillips at defensive tackle, the Bills will have to roll with Jones, rookies TJ Sanders and Deone Walker, and probably Larry Ogunjobi, though they could also dress Phidarian Mathis.

Bills sign two others to practice squad

The never-ending practice squad shuffle, which has been quite a thing this season, also continued as the Bills signed cornerback Daryl Porter and quarterback Shane Buechele.

Porter, a rookie, was most recently on the Steelers practice squad before being released last week. He fills Jackson’s spot on the practice squad. Buechele spent most of the season with the Bills before the Chiefs signed him to their active roster late in the season and he played last Sunday in Kansas City’s finale against the Raiders, completing 7 of 14 passes for 88 yards, the first regular-season playing time of his career.

He will be the scout team quarterback this week, which frees up Mitchell Trubisky to take the backup reps behind Josh Allen.

While Hairston and Bernard are almost certainly out, Prater’s status is fluid. The 41-year-old kicker reinjured his quad muscle against the Jets and could not finish the game. Tuesday, the Bills put in place a contingency plan in case Prater can’t recover as they signed kicker Matthew Wright to their practice squad.

But while Prater took Wednesday off, McDermott said he will test his leg Thursday.

“We won’t kick Matt today, but we will try and kick him tomorrow so we can kind of get a feel for where he’s at and hopefully he’s good to go as of tomorrow,” McDermott said. “This is just on a day-by-day; right now that’s the plan and we can take a look tomorrow and just see where he’s at and then hopefully all is well and he gets a chance to then kind of get back to some rest after that as we head into game time.”","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/09/PROC/85591974007-usatsi-26813612.jpg?crop=7172,4035,x0,y771&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-07 19:02:25.449280

As a division winner, they earned a home game Wild Card weekend. The bad news? Matthew Stafford and the Los Angeles Rams (12-5) will be lining up opposite them this weekend in Charlotte.

All kidding aside, the task is large as the 10-point spread indicates. But wait! The Panthers played the Rams in Week 13…and won in Charlotte, 31-28. Bryce Young threw three touchdowns and forced the Rams into three turnovers that afternoon. History says a win is possible but replicating that outcome will not be easy for Carolina.

The Rams’ offense is elite. No team scored more points (518) than Los Angeles during the regular season. The Patriots were a distant second with a total of 490 points scored. Threats to score lurk all over the field for the Rams. Davante Adams scored 14 times this season. Puka Nacua found the endzone 10 times. Kyren Williams crossed the goal line ten times as well and Blake Corum contributed six touchdowns himself.

The Panthers ranked 27th in the regular season averaging just 18.3 points per game. Carolina’s game plan in Week 13 focused on the run game and it worked as the Panthers gained 164 yards on 40 carries. Rookie Tetairoa McMillan caught just one pass that day, but it was a 43-yard touchdown grab. He needs to be more involved in the rematch.

Carolina’s hope lies in again establishing the run game and keeping Bryce Young upright. If they do both those things they will shorten the number of possessions with an eye on keeping it within a score going into the fourth quarter. The Rams are the more talented team at maybe every position on the field. MVP-favorite Matthew Stafford needs to play like one. If he does, the Rams will roll to an easy, rocking chair win Wild Card weekend.

This is the Panthers first trip to the postseason since 2017. They lost in the Wild Card Round to New Orleans that season, 31-26. The Rams were in the playoffs last year. After defeating the Vikings 27-9 in the Wild Card round they lost 28-22 to the Eagles in the Divisional Round.

The up-tempo, shotgun-centric ""Air Raid"" (with adjustments) offense has been his thing. Good, bad, in the middle, regardless of location or role. He's always been a tireless worker: Back in 2022, ""Hard Knocks"" captured him waking up just after 3 a.m. and arriving at the Arizona Cardinals' practice facility before 4 a.m., citing his playing career not reaching the heights he wanted as a motivating factor. With the Washington Commanders, he and Daniels were consistently among the first people at the facility.

""I'm pretty consistent with the coaching style,"" Kingsbury said early in 2025 training camp, when he was coming off the Commanders' breakthrough.

NFL Power Rankings: Big miss on Seahawks and preseason top 10 as Chiefs, Lions miss postseason

Pete Prisco

And near the end of the year, Washington's disappointing 5-12 season that proved his ouster?

""Yeah, I've seen [the no-huddle offense] done at a high level you know, whether it's Arizona or here at a very high level and won games and had a lot of yards, a lot of success in that regard. So, I think I'm pretty confident, you know, in that style of play when the pieces are there that you can play a really high level, and it's a very challenging offensive stop.""

Kingsbury, 46, didn't have the pieces this year; that much is certain. Daniels played in just seven games, and he left three of those seven early. All parties involved wished Terry McLaurin's extension had been done earlier so he could have had more time to grow with Daniels in training camp and get into football shape: McLaurin suffered a quad injury in Week 3 and played in a career-low 10 games. The team's other top outside wide receiver, Noah Brown, appeared in just four games. The offensive line wasn't whole until mid-October.

And yet the Commanders still finished 12th in offensive success rate and won games with not only Daniels but Marcus Mariota and Josh Johnson. Players spoke glowingly of Kingsbury, with Daniels saying ""I love working with Kliff,"" and ""Me and him have a special relationship. Mariota praised Kingsbury's system for making things easy on the quarterback. McLaurin talked about the way he, his role and his alignments grew under Kingsbury and also complimented Kingsbury for being ""open to communication.""

But coach Dan Quinn wanted a more traditional run-heavy, clock management-driven, approach, ESPN's John Keim reported, even though that goes against what Kingsbury has always been. The Commanders had the fifth-highest rushing rate in the NFL over Kingsbury's two seasons as offensive coordinator, but they also had the most quarterback rushes in the NFL (24th-most running back runs). Kingsbury's system was tremendous for Daniels in Year 1. It was less successful in Year 2 for several reasons, some out of Kingsbury's control.

""There's a ton of different decisions I wish we would've made and I would've made, and more just like individual play calls than anything, you know, our style of play was a bit different,"" Kingsbury said. ""Like I said, trying to slow the games down, limit possessions, do things of that nature. But yeah, there are a ton of things I wish I would've done better as far as scheme and maximizing players and things of that nature.""

Kingsbury couldn't control injuries. He couldn't control the defense being one of the NFL's worst.

""We had a bunch of guys that were kind of in and out of the lineup, and it's a credit to this staff of getting these guys prepared,"" Mariota said.

It's not a ""wrong"" call from Quinn, per se, but it's certainly a big one. Sometimes circumstances change. Sometimes strategies change. The Commanders will have big changes ahead, and Quinn had better be right.

Kingsbury, meanwhile, will likely be in the running for both head coach and offensive coordinator gigs. Call his offense what you will, but it is not ""gimmicky"" in any sense of the word. Kingsbury showed flexibility and creativity as a play caller and play designer. The Commanders had a well-versed, multi-faceted rushing attack and a screen game that worked wonders at its peak. Kingsbury helped produce not only a career year McLaurin but a renaissance from Zach Ertz in his mid-30s and a bounce-back from Deebo Samuel in his late-20s. He often made do with castoffs and youngsters, elevating the games of players such as Noah Brown, Dyami Brown and Olamide Zaccheaus.

Here's where Kingsbury could end up next.

1. New York Giants offensive coordinator

Kingsbury has previously expressed a desire to return to head coaching, and he decided to remain in Washington last year, when he could have been one of the top candidates for an opening. How much a tough 2025 hurt his coaching candidacy remains to be determined, but his best fit could be to remain an offensive coordinator.

He'll want a mobile quarterback, versatile running game and some weapons to maximize that attack, and the Giants stand out as the team that fits the bill best. Jaxson Dart showed impressive rushing ability, and the Giants have a tandem of capable backs in bruiser Cam Skattebo as well as the speedier Tyrone Tracy Jr., who has quietly reached 1,000+ yards from scrimmage in each of his two seasons. Malik Nabers looked like a star in the making before an early-season knee injury, and Wan'Dale Robinson could be a versatile, movable chess piece as well. Tracy and Robinson in particular could help fuel Kingsbury's versatility as a play caller and designer.

2. Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator

Cam Ward quietly finished his rookie season strongly, throwing for eight touchdowns and just one interception over his last four full games (he left the season finale with a shoulder injury but won't need surgery). He's doesn't run like Murray, Daniels or Dart, but he's not a statue, either. He showed impressive escapability down the stretch of his debut season, and his sack numbers declined in kind.

Ward has said he wants to be involved in the coach-hiring process, and if the candidate at hand isn't Kingsbury, he would do well to pitch Kingsbury as the offensive coordinator. The Titans have a long way to go int he rebuild process, but Kingsbury has developed young quarterbacks everywhere he's been. Tennessee has some gifted if inconsistent wide receivers, too, in Himere Dike and Elic Ayomanor.

3. Giants coach

The Giants would do well to strongly consider Kingsbury for the main gig, not just a coordinator one. Kingsbury has undoubtedly learned from his time as the Cardinals' coach, which included him building a team from 3-13 the year before he arrived to 5-10, then 8-8, then 11-6. People often recall his final season -- 4-13 -- and his struggles down the second half of seasons most, but they forget how good of a job he did, with two-10th overall total offenses. He did it all with Kyler Murray a quarterback who not only had limitations but played his best ball under Kingsbury and now appears on his way out of Arizona.

Hiring Kingsbury would be a big bet. He would have to get the call at defensive coordinator right. The Giants really struggled on that side in 2025 but have foundational pieces along the line. It's a big market that comes with a ton of scrutiny. If Kingsbury is up for it, though, he and Dart could form a strong partnership.

4. Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator

Could Kingsbury's home be just a short drive north? The Ravens sent shockwaves through the NFL by firing John Harbaugh on Tuesday, ending an 18-year partnership with one of the NFL's most stable franchises.

Kingsbury and Lamar Jackson could be a fit for all the reasons listed about other quarterbacks: mobility, operation out of the shotgun, etc. The Ravens do have Derrick Henry, so Kingsbury might have to adjust to be more running back-centric, but he has been willing to adjust before. Zay Flowers seems like a strong fit for Kingsbury's quick-hitting passing schemes, too.

It's not a perfect fit. Jackson isn't a young quarterback like basically all the others Kingsbury has worked with. Running up-tempo seems at first glance incongruous for a team that might be better suited to grind some games out in the grimy, tough AFC North. But the Ravens need change badly. They didn't fire Harbaugh to keep the status quo. Kingsbury would have to interview well and show a clear plan for melding his style to Baltimore's personnel. Just don't count it out completely.

5. Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator

The Falcons fired coach Raheem Morris, and while that doesn't preclude offensive coordinator Zac Robinson from coming back, there's a reasonable chance whomever succeeds Morris will want to handpick his offensive coordinator. If that coach is a first-timer, having the experience of Kingsbury would be helpful; if it isn't a first-timer, Kingsbury could still fit the bill.

Atlanta has a strong offensive line, a superstar versatile running back in Bijan Robinson and a star wide receiver in Drake London. Quarterback is a big question, but Michael Penix Jr. has operated out of the shotgun his entire career, so there's at least some synergy there. Penix isn't a dual-threat guy, but Kingsbury has shown abilities to adapt. And if Penix turns out not to be the answer, Kingsbury could again be a mentor for another young quarterback.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/06/fdc4ff99-0ea6-4050-9875-90780935defa/thumbnail/1200x675/3f63c8e810d31bd436daa16fddd5a245/kliffkingsbury.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 18:01:36.417199

Johnson, who suffered a Lisfranc sprain against the Detroit Lions on Nov. 16, appears headed for a return as the Eagles face the San Francisco 49ers in the wildcard round of the NFL playoffs.

The Eagles are beginning their on-field practices on Jan. 7 for the Jan. 11 wildcard playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers on Jan. 11.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

Before practice, Eagles coach Nick Sirianni wouldn't say if Johnson will be among those practicing. But Sirianni did rave about Johnson, who's in his 13th season and considered one of the top tackles in the NFL.

Sirianni called Johnson ""a difference maker."" That effusive praise could indicate that Sirianni is expecting Johnson, a six-time Pro Bowl selection, to return against the 49ers.

""Obviously, Lane’s a big difference maker,"" Sirianni said. ""I know he’s working like crazy to get himself back. We’ll see where that is this week. But he’s a difference-maker. He’s one of the best who’s ever done it.""

Fred Johnson has replaced Lane Johnson at right tackle for the past seven games. The Eagles have gone 3-4 this season without Lane Johnson. That was a snapshot of the vast disparity in the Eagles' record when Lane Johnson plays versus when he does not over his 13-year career.

The Eagles are 110-57-1 when Lane Johnson plays, a winning percentage of .658. They're 18-27 when the 35-year-old does not play, a winning percentage of .400.

It's easy to see why, although Sirianni wouldn't divulge those reasons because of ""scheme."" Basically, the Eagles don't need to provide help when Johnson is at right tackle, and that frees up other aspects of how the Eagles block.

That can open up running room for Saquon Barkley, and provide more time for quarterback Jalen Hurts to pass, or run himself.

""He allows you to do some different things,"" Sirianni said about Lane Johnson. ""Again, Fred has done a nice job when he came in and played for him. We won a lot of games with Fred in the lineup.

""Lane is just a difference-maker. And it can affect everything. There’s a reason he’s going to the Hall of Fame. There’s a reason he’s going to be in the Eagles Hall of Fame, the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He’s one of the best ever to do it at that position. And he shows that year in and year out … I’ve been with him for five years, and it just feels like he just keeps getting better and better.""

Raiders coaching candidates after Pete Carroll firing: Tom Brady ties to Patriots, plus fresh faces Garrett Podell 6.","The 2025 NFL regular season is in the books, and change is already in the air. The offseason is a time of immense turnover, as players switch teams via free agency or trade, teams change their rosters by acquiring them through one of those avenues or in the draft, and plenty of clubs swap out their coaches as they look to improve from one year to the next.

We're here today to talk about the latter group of teams. As of Tuesday afternoon, seven NFL teams have fired their coaches. The Tennessee Titans and New York Giants fired Brian Callahan and Brian Daboll during the regular season. The Atlanta Falcons fired Raheem Morris on Sunday night. And on Monday, the Cleveland Browns fired Kevin Stefanski, the Las Vegas Raiders fired Pete Carroll and the Arizona Cardinals fired Jonathan Gannon. The Baltimore Ravens fired John Harbaugh after 18 seasons on Tuesday afternoon.

In the wake of all of those changes, let's rank the coaching vacancies in order of their desirability.

Follow live updates on NFL coaching and GM changes, firings and rumors.

1. Ravens

The Baltimore Ravens are the only team this coaching cycle that can offer prospective candidates the opportunity to coach a multi-time NFL MVP quarterback in Lamar Jackson.

Plus, running back Derrick Henry showed no signs of slowing down in his age-31 season in 2025, rushing for 1,585 yards -- the second-most in the entire NFL. There are also a couple All-Pro building blocks on defense with linebacker Roquan Smith and safety Kyle Hamilton. Baltimore should make a playoff return in 2026 no matter who their head coach is provided they reinforce Jackson's offensive line as well as their defensive line. The Ravens do have some cap space to play with at the moment with $12.4 million in effective cap space, according to OverTheCap.com. Moving off of defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike's contract down the road following his neck injury could free up significant cap space in the coming years.

2. Falcons

There are a couple of things working against the Falcons here: First and most importantly, there is extreme uncertainty surrounding the quarterback situation. Michael Penix Jr. is coming off yet another knee injury. Kirk Cousins is probably not long for Atlanta given that the Falcons can save $22.5 million by cutting him (or $35 million by designating him as a post-June 1 release).

The Falcons also do not have a first-round pick in this year's draft after trading up for James Pearce Jr. in 2025 and are set to enter the offseason over the 2026 salary cap.

All that said, Atlanta has the most talent of any team with a head-coaching vacancy. Between Bijan Robinson and Drake London on offense, there is already a baseline level of star talent to build around. Kyle Pitts could be back. The offensive line is solid.

The defense slowed down after an incredibly hot start to the year but still finished the year 14th in EPA per play allowed. There is at least a foundation for success on that side of the ball, if you can land on the right defensive mind, whether as the head coach or coordinator. The Falcons also play in the NFC South, which is one of the worst divisions in football.

The Falcons are running this search in a strange way, though, with separate consulting firms leading the search for the coach and the general manager. Things could get weird if the GM doesn't have the chance to hire their preferred coach.

3. Giants

The Giants won't have the No. 1 pick in the draft like it seemed they would a few weeks ago, but they do have a few things working in their favor.

The first is the young talent on offense, and specifically at quarterback with Jaxson Dart, who showed flashes during his rookie season that he can be a strong option for the Giants under center. Malik Nabers and Cam Skattebo are attractive as well, although they'll both be coming off of major injuries. And Andrew Thomas is an elite tackle.

Then there's the defense, which boasts one of the best fronts in the league -- or should, at least. So long as the Giants have Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns and Abdul Carter, they should be able to get after it up front. They need to improve on the second and third levels and they definitely need to get better against the run, but there's talent on this side of the ball.

A potential issue is the ownership and management situation, where John Mara is sadly in poor health and general manager Joe Schoen is set to return (and lead the coaching search) despite not exactly having distinguished himself in the role.

4. Titans

Tennessee restructured its front office over the weekend such that Mike Borgonzi will oversee the 53-man roster and lead the coaching search while Chad Brinker will handle the other football operations responsibilities. The Titans had one of the worst rosters and coaching situations in the NFL this season, but they might be set up to make a jump next year.

Cam Ward's overall numbers don't look great, but there were so many flashes of high-level talent when you turn on the film. He was let down by a decrepit supporting cast and has a chance to be much better next year if the Titans improve the talent around him. And they'll have every chance to do so because Tennessee is set to enter the offseason with over $105 million in cap space and the No. 4 pick in the draft.

They're not necessarily a candidate to go worst-to-first like the Bears and Patriots did this year, but they definitely have a chance to be a lot better next season if they hit on the right coach and use their budget and draft capital wisely, like those teams did.

5. Raiders

The Raiders are here for four reasons: Brock Bowers, Ashton Jeanty, the No. 1 pick in the draft and $100 million in cap room. (You could say five reasons and include Maxx Crosby, but there are already rumors swirling that the Raiders are finally willing to listen to trade offers for the star edge rusher, so he may not be long for Las Vegas.) There is just not much talent on this team outside of those players.

There is a loooong way to go before the Raiders can be remotely competitive, and it doesn't help that they play in the AFC West, which is one of the most competitive divisions in football. Like the Titans, though, they can take a jump next season if they hit on their coach and whichever quarterback they presumably draft with the No. 1 pick, and spend their free-agent money to upgrade the talent level on the roster.

One drawback here is the ownership situation, where Mark Davis seems to flail wildly from one plan to the next in quick succession. The Vegas job is not exactly stable, and doesn't come with a lot of job security, as evidenced by all the changes the Raiders have made over the last several years.

6. Browns

The Browns have a good defense built around Myles Garrett, who is just an inhuman monster coming around the edge. They drafted a pair of star rookies in tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and linebacker Carson Schwesinger. They have multiple first-round picks in this year's draft thanks to last year's Travis Hunter trade.

What the Browns don't have is much other talent on offense (Quinshon Judkins will be coming off a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula), an answer at quarterback or any cap space to solve their various issues. Cleveland is set to begin the offseason more than $12 million over the cap, according to Over the Cap, and it still has the albatross of Deshaun Watson's contract weighing down its books in both 2026 and 2027, at least.

The Browns also have an ownership and management situation that is, shall we say, not all that desirable. The Haslam family has run one of the most unstable organizations in the league, and Andrew Berry hasn't exactly put together a great roster. (The combination of the Haslams and Berry was responsible for the disastrous Watson trade.)

7. Cardinals

Arizona lost 14 of its final 15 games this season and looked incredibly listless in doing so. The Cardinals have an uncertain quarterback situation with Kyler Murray seemingly not long for the team, and they really have no viable path to solving that situation this offseason unless it becomes a three-quarterback draft or the Jets decide to pass on someone like Dante Moore (if he enters) or Fernando Mendoza at No. 2 overall.

Arizona is set to have only around $21 million in cap room (and only $9.8 million in effective cap space), per Over the Cap, so it's not like there are a lot of resources here to solve the various roster issues.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/06/4ef75398-b94a-4744-9a80-f94340397a00/thumbnail/1200x675/b9f6d4430764cbd0f2250182b0c81009/gettyimages-2254685268.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 17:01:40.112140

Playoff results won't matter because it's a regular-season award. Winners of the AP NFL awards will be revealed at ""NFL Honors"" on Feb. 5.

Stafford had an outstanding season for the Los Angeles Rams, leading them to a 12-5 record and the NFC's No. 5 seed. Maye led the New England Patriots (14-3) to a 10-win turnaround and the AFC's No. 2 seed in just his second season.

Stafford was first in the NFL with 4,707 yards and 46 touchdowns. His passer rating of 109.2 was second only to Maye, who finished at 113.5. Maye had 4,394 yards passing and 31 TDs. Both quarterbacks threw eight interceptions. Maye had the higher completion percentage, 72% to 65%.

Christian McCaffrey also belongs in the conversation after an outstanding do-it-all season in which he helped the injury-depleted San Francisco 49ers (12-5) overcome losing several key players and going long stretches without QB Brock Purdy. The Niners even reached Week 18 with a chance at the No. 1 seed before Seattle's defense shut them down in a 13-3 win.

Only three quarterbacks have ever won MVP on a team that didn't win its division. Peyton Manning did it in 2008, Steve McNair as a co-MVP in 2003 and Johnny Unitas in 1967, when the Colts went 11-1-2 but missed the playoffs.

Last year, Josh Allen edged Lamar Jackson for MVP. However, Jackson was the first-team All-Pro. It was the first time a first-team All-Pro didn't win the NFL MVP award since 1987, when John Elway was the MVP and Joe Montana received All-Pro honors.

The MVP award is given to a player who had the most valuable season while All-Pro is a statistical recognition. All-Pro rosters will be announced this week and the debate will still continue until next month.

Playoff seeding

The Detroit Lions proposed last season that playoff seeding should be based on winning percentage instead of automatically placing division winners in the top four spots.

NFL owners voted against it in May because a majority value the importance of teams winning their own division.

""I'm a division purist,"" Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said.

The league will likely revisit this idea after a second straight season in which three teams with better records will play on the road during wild-card weekend.

The 49ers (12-5) play at the Philadelphia Eagles (11-6). The Rams (12-5) play at the Carolina Panthers (8-9). The Houston Texans (12-5) play at the Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7).

Last year, the teams with the better records went 1-2.

The Rams-Panthers matchup will be the ninth time a road team in the playoffs has at least four wins more than its opponent. The teams with the better records are just 2-6 in those games.

Defense needs help

Two of the teams with the NFL's top four defenses didn't even make the playoffs.

The Vikings (9-8) were third, allowing 282.6 yards per game. The Browns (5-12) finished fourth, giving up 283.6.

Both teams had quarterback issues. Minnesota lost starter J.J. McCarthy for seven games and backup Carson Wentz started five games, playing the final 2 1/2 games with a shoulder that required season-ending surgery.

The Browns started veteran Joe Flacco for four games, rookie Dillon Gabriel for six and rookie Shedeur Sanders the last seven.

Houston and Denver finished 1-2. The Broncos earned the AFC's No. 1 seed. The Texans got the No. 5 seed.

How, then, does coach Andy Reid restructure his team’s offense either without Mahomes or with a weakened version of their already-legendary signal-caller?
The answer, according to a new mock draft, will come in the backfield, with the top running back available out of the college ranks in 2026.

“You will see a lot of 2026 NFL mock draft pundits put Jeremiyah Love with the Chiefs at pick No.","To say the Kansas City Chiefs had a disappointing 2025 season would be quite an understatement. Not only did the team that won two of the last three Super Bowls and three of the last six finish out of the playoffs with only six wins, their lowest total since 2012, they played their final three games without future Hall of Fame quarterback Patrick Mahomes — and they start next season without him as well.

Mahomes suffered a season-ending knee injury in the Chiefs’ Week 15 game against the Los Angeles Chargers, and is now on a rehab timeline that could take him into the 2026 season. Even if he is ready for Week 1, there is little chance Mahomes will be at full strength.

But Mahomes has six years to go on his massive, 10-year, $450 million contract with Kansas City, and even if he didn’t, there is little chance that the Chiefs would look to replace him either through the draft or free agency.

How, then, does coach Andy Reid restructure his team’s offense either without Mahomes or with a weakened version of their already-legendary signal-caller? The answer, according to a new mock draft, will come in the backfield, with the top running back available out of the college ranks in 2026.

Notre Dame Rusher Topped 1,300 Yards in 2025

Thanks to their 6-11 record, the Chiefs will have their highest draft pick since 2013 when they held the No. 1 overall pick and used it on offensive tackle Eric Fisher.

In 2026, the Chiefs will pick at No. 9 in the first round. According to a mock draft by ClutchPoints released on Monday, Kansas City will use the pick on Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love, a Heisman Trophy finalist who rushed for 1,372 yards in 2025, eighth in the nation.

“You will see a lot of 2026 NFL mock draft pundits put Jeremiyah Love with the Chiefs at pick No. 9, and this one is no exception,” wrote ClutchPoints draft expert Tim Crean. “Arguably the best overall offensive player in the draft, Love fixes one of the Chiefs’ biggest issues, and building the offense around Love next season will help hold down the fort until Patrick Mahomes returns to full strength.”

Love Called ‘Complete Weapon’ on Offense

Crean was correct. According to the NFL Mock Draft Database, Love, who will be 21 years old by the time of the 2026 NFL draft, is the consensus pick among all major mock drafts to go to the Chiefs at No. 9.

If those projections prove correct, Love would be the first Notre Dame running back drafted in the first round since Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis went 10th overall to the Los Angeles Rams in 1993.

“Love is a dynamic and explosive running back who possesses the skill set to be a complete weapon in an NFL offense,” according to a scouting report by Damian Parson of Bleacher Report. “He combines home-run top-end speed with route-running and pass-catching ability to impact the offense in multiple ways.”

One obstacle to the Chiefs adding Love to their rebuilding roster out of the 2026 draft would be the New Orleans Saints, who are also reported to have interest in picking the Fighting Irish star.

The Saints own the No. 8 pick in the draft, one slot ahead of Kansas City, meaning the Chiefs may be forced to sacrifice some lower-round picks to trade up at least two spots in order to guarantee their shot at taking Love.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/jeremiyah-love-draft-patrick-mahomes.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-07 15:01:38.059662

Add a new offensive coordinator to the list of competitors Campbell is seeking in 2026.","The Lions are moving on from Ben Johnson's replacement.

Two days after defeating Johnson's Chicago Bears in Week 18, Detroit fired offensive coordinator John Morton on Tuesday, NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero reported.

The team later announced it had ""parted ways"" with Morton.

Morton was tabbed to fill the void left by Johnson when the former Lions OC left to take the top job in Chicago this past offseason, but he didn't retain play-calling duties for even one full season. Lions coach Dan Campbell took the responsibility from Morton prior to their Week 10 win over Washington, an explosive, lopsided triumph that appeared to instantly justify Campbell's decision.

At the time, Morton backed Campbell in his decision, telling reporters ""I fully support it. ... I want to do whatever it takes to win.""

In the end, however, Morton met the same fate as the last offensive coordinator to surrender play-calling duties to Campbell, Anthony Lynn, who gave up the responsibility in the 2021 season and parted with the Lions at the end of the campaign.

With Morton at the controls, Detroit posted a 5-3 record, averaged 28.8 offensive points per game and 350.8 yards per game. Once Campbell took over -- a period that included increased instability up front due to injury-related changes along the offensive line -- the Lions went 4-5, averaged nearly two fewer offensive points per game (26.9), but bumped up their yardage average to 393.1, per NFL Research.

Jared Goff's performance varied, too, but not in the fashion Lions fans would have liked. His completion percentage dropped by nearly 10 percentage points, he threw the same number of touchdowns (17) but two more interceptions (5) and his passer rating subsequently dropped from 115.2 to 98.6. Much of these declines could also be blamed on Detroit's fading running game, once a hallmark of the Lions' offensive operation that devolved into only a mild threat to opposing defenses.

Ultimately, the change didn't make the difference Campbell was seeking. With a struggling offensive line holding them back, the Lions struggled to build momentum toward a late-season playoff push, finishing 9-8 and out of the postseason. Their season-long totals dropped from landing in the top four in points per game (ranked first), points per drive (first), third-down percentage (fourth) and total yards per game (second) in 2024 to finishing second, seventh, 20th and fifth in 2025.

Following the Week 18 win, Campbell was brutally honest with himself, telling reporters he graded himself ""a freaking F"" for the job he did with his team in 2025.

""We've got nobody to blame but ourselves. But I really don't believe we're that far off,"" Campbell explained before foreshadowing Tuesday's staff move. ""There's a couple of things we can do, and I just want to make sure we go after it. I'm not saying we weren't hungry, but let's get that hunger back and we're going to bring in some guys to compete.""

Simpson's arm talent, footwork and operational skills all appear to be starter-caliber, even if he's not considered an elite athlete -- and further development also might be needed.

In partnership with Jackson, Harbaugh and the Ravens re-emerged as yearly threats, missing the playoffs only in the 2021 season and this most recent one.
That will now be something for general manager Eric DeCosta and another head coach to answer.","A missed 44-yard field goal on the final play of the 2025 regular season will mark the end for one of the NFL's longest-tenured head coaches.

The Baltimore Ravens have fired John Harbaugh after narrowly failing to clinch the AFC North and a playoff spot that went with it in his 18th season with the team, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero reported Tuesday.

Harbaugh, who took over the Ravens in 2008, ends his storied run helming the club with a 180-113 regular-season record, having reached 12 playoffs, four AFC title games and won Super Bowl XLVII. He leaves the winningest coach in franchise history by 100 victories.

""Following a comprehensive evaluation of the season and the overall direction of our organization, I decided to make a change at head coach. Today I informed John that he has been relieved of his duties,"" Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said in a statement on Tuesday. ""This was an incredibly difficult decision, given the tremendous 18 years we have spent together and the profound respect I have for John as a coach and, most importantly, as a great man of integrity.

""Throughout what I firmly believe is a Hall of Fame coaching career, John has delivered a Super Bowl championship to Baltimore and served as a steadfast pillar of humility and leadership. He and his family have deeply embedded themselves in this community. For these profound contributions, on and off the field, we should all be forever grateful.""

The Ravens have been among the most successful teams in the league under Harbaugh, but on the heels of an 8-9 season after entering September as a top Super Bowl contender, Baltimore has recognized a need for a change.

""I was hoping for a different kind of message on my last day here, someday, but that day has come today,"" Harbaugh said in a statement on Tuesday. ""It comes with disappointment certainly, but more with GRATITUDE & APPRECIATION.

""Gratitude to the owner and organization who was willing to bring in a head coach who made his mark with Special Teams success. A difficult thing to do … and Appreciation for all the moments, all these years, that are etched into eternity.""

Baltimore was one of several NFL heavyweights to falter this season. The team started 1-5, unable to avoid digging a hole as star quarterback Lamar Jackson suffered a hamstring injury in Week 4 and missed three games. The defense was likewise dinged by injuries.

Five straight wins followed the Week 7 bye to claw back above .500, evidence of Harbaugh's culture, as well as the team's talent and mettle. But consecutive losses after that put Baltimore in desperation mode. Harbaugh and Co. entered the penultimate week of the season needing to win out and get lucky.

Jackson, a mainstay on the injury report all season, missed Week 17, but the Ravens still ran all over the Green Bay Packers for a win, and the aforementioned luck shined on them as the Pittsburgh Steelers were upset by the Cleveland Browns to set up a faceoff for the division on Sunday Night Football of Week 18.

A characteristically low-scoring affair between the Ravens and Steelers suddenly turned electric in the fourth quarter, featuring four lead changes in the final nine minutes of play. The Ravens nearly made it five thanks to a desperate fourth-down conversion and subsequent kneel-down to set up a 44-yard attempt by Tyler Loop, down, 26-24.

The rookie kicker instead missed his first career field goal attempt under 50 yards, sending the Ravens home for the playoffs and snapping a two-year streak of division titles.

In some ways it is fitting that Harbaugh's run as Ravens head coach ended via a battle to the wire against Mike Tomlin, the only longer-tenured active head coach, in their 40th head-to-head meeting.

It's the sixth time Harbaugh has missed the postseason and only the second time in the past eight years, but the overall struggle of the campaign and fickleness of championship windows apparently convinced Baltimore to try to jolt itself back into contention under a new voice.

""Our goal has always been and will always be to win Championships,"" Bisciotti said. ""We strive to consistently perform at the highest level on the field and be a team and organization our fans take pride in. I will always be grateful for the extraordinary hard work and dedication displayed by John and his staff throughout the many successful years. I wish he, Ingrid and Alison all the best going forward. ...

""We now begin the challenging, but exciting, process of identifying the next leader of our football team. We fully understand the expectations of our fans and everyone in the Ravens organization. Finding another strong leader and partner who will reflect these high standards is paramount.""

Harbaugh's departure will be considered hasty by some (or perhaps most), but the fact remains that the Ravens have not won a Super Bowl since the 2012 season. They've fallen short of the AFC Championship Game in all but one year since. Despite 11 double-digit-win seasons, Harbaugh-coached teams have too often become synonymous with late-game collapses; Baltimore has blown 46 fourth-quarter leads since 2008, tied for second-most during that span, per NFL Research.

Baltimore and Harbaugh had seemed close to a breakup years ago, during a three-plus season lull that followed the tremendous success experienced at the onset of his tenure.

In his first season, 2008, Harbaugh led the team all the way to the AFC Championship Game with a rookie Joe Flacco, kicking off a five-year stretch of consecutive playoff berths that was finally concluded with a Super Bowl victory.

Following an 8-8 season during a Super Bowl hangover in 2013 and a loss in the Divisional Round the following campaign, the Ravens failed to reach the postseason from 2015-17.

Heading into a Week 10 bye week at 4-5 in 2018, a split felt imminent. Only Harbaugh then handed the reins to Jackson, at the time a first-round rookie, and the Ravens rattled off wins in six of their last seven to take the AFC North.

In partnership with Jackson, Harbaugh and the Ravens re-emerged as yearly threats, missing the playoffs only in the 2021 season and this most recent one. Still, each of those postseason trips ended in disappointment, seemingly capped by a Divisional Round ceiling outside the '23 campaign.

Jackson has won two MVPs, but he dealt with a string of injuries from 2021-22 that contributed to murkiness over a potential extension in the 2023 offseason. One was eventually struck, though questions about his place in Baltimore were again raised during an injury-plagued downturn for the Ravens this season. He also declined to address his future immediately following the season-ending loss to the Steelers.

That will now be something for general manager Eric DeCosta and another head coach to answer.

Harbaugh, 63, only the third coach in Ravens history, will certainly be a candidate for any other team with a vacancy across the league.

The Ravens will move on in search of their fourth head coach in its 30-year history, hoping this season's setback was temporary and needing to find a way to go from so close for so many years to Super Bowl winner soon.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/eyw0rlaloqntoioqovar,N,,2026-01-07 14:02:50.511843

1. Quarterback Kyle Allen

2025 stats: 3 games

Twentyman: Starting quarterback Jared Goff did not miss a single game in 2025 as Allen was relegated to end-of-game duties with two pass attempts. He was a valuable resource for Goff in game preparation.

2. Linebacker Alex Anzalone

2025 stats: 16 games, 95 tackles (52 solo), 4 TFL, 2.5 sacks, 6 QB hits, 1 INT, 9 PD

Twentyman: Anzalone, 31, has been in Detroit since head coach Dan Campbell arrived in 2021 and has been one of the leaders on defense. He's been a versatile and reliable veteran in the linebacker corps with his ability to play all three spots.

3. Offensive lineman Kayode Awosika

2025 stats: 13 games, 2.5 sacks allowed, 0 penalties

Twentyman: Awosika has been a spot starter and key reserve playing in 49 games along Detroit's offensive line the last four seasons.

4. Offensive lineman Trystan Colon

2025 stats: 12 games, 1 sack allowed, 4 penalties

Twentyman: Colon made four starts for the Lions at guard and center and gave Detroit veteran depth along their offensive line having made 15 starts in Baltimore and Arizona before arriving in Detroit last offseason.

5. Linebacker Zach Cunningham

2025 stats: 4 games, 7 tackles (5 solo), 1 TFL

Twentyman: Cunningham was a versatile reserve and special teamer who played in just four games this season before a hamstring injury placed him on injured reserve.

6. Edge rusher Marcus Davenport

2025 stats: 8 games, 14 tackles, 1 TFL, 1 sack, 3 QB hits

Twentyman: Davenport dealt with injury again in 2025 and has totaled just 10 games played in his two seasons in Detroit.

7. Tight end Anthony Firkser

2025 stats: 7 games, 8 rec., 53 yds

Twentyman: Firkser played a bigger role toward the end of the season when the Lions had to dip into their tight end depth due to injury.

8. Offensive lineman Jamarco Jones

2025 stats: N/A

Twentyman: The Lions could have used Jones' veteran presence along an offensive line that dealt with injury all season long, but Jones was placed on season-ending injury reserve with an ankle injury before the regular season began.

9. Defensive lineman Roy Lopez

2025 stats: 17 games, 30 tackles (11 solo), 4 TFL, 2.0 sacks, 5 QB hits, 1 PD

Twentyman: Lopez was one of Detroit's better free agent signings last offseason. He was an impact player in the center of Detroit's defensive front with a proven track record of availability and production.

10. Defensive back Avonte Maddox

2025 stats: 14 games, 32 tackles (23 solo), 1 TFL, 1 INT, 4 PD, 1 FF

Twentyman: Like Lopez, Maddox was an important free agent acquisition last offseason bringing a veteran presence to Detroit's secondary and the versatility to play both safety and cornerback in Kelvin Sheppard's defense. He stepped in and played a big role when Detroit lost safeties Kerby Joseph and Brian Branch to injury.

11. Defensive back Arthur Maulet

2025 stats: 9 games, 14 tackles (11 solo), 1 INT, 2 PD

Twentyman: Maulet was asked to step in and play a role at nickel corner and on special teams in nine games this season and he made some splash plays.

12. Safety Jalen Mills

2025 stats: 3 games, 6 tackles (2 solo), 1 PD

Twentyman: The 10-year veteran was brought in when Detroit's numbers at safety started to deteriorate because of injury. He ended up playing three games with the Lions late in the year.

13. Edge Al-Quadin Muhammad

2025 stats: 17 games, 25 tackles (15 solo), 9 TFL, 11.0 sacks, 20 QB hits

Twentyman: It was a breakout eighth season for Muhammad, 30, who recorded career highs in sacks, tackles for loss and QB hits. He became just the 11th player in franchise history to produce a season with double-digit sacks.

14. Defensive lineman Levi Onwuzurike

2025 stats: N/A

Twentyman: Onwuzurike was coming off a career season in 2024 but never made it to the regular season in 2025 as he was placed on the PUP list to begin training camp with an ACL injury. The former second-round pick never had the consistent production the Lions were hoping for the last four seasons, mainly due to injury.

15. Defensive lineman Josh Paschal

2025 stats: N/A

Twentyman: Like Onwuzurike, injuries never seemed to let Paschal reach his full potential in Detroit. The former second-round pick underwent back surgery before the season. His practice window was opened in November but he never progressed enough to be activated to the 53-man roster. He had 5.0 sacks in 36 games played over three seasons.

16. Wide receiver Kalif Raymond

2025 stats: 15 games, 24 rec., 289 yds, 1 TD, 7.5 punt return avg. 1 TD, 26.8 kickoff return avg.

Twentyman: Raymond broke Mel Gray's franchise record for most punt return yards in team history this season. He's been a glue piece on the roster since 2021 and a player who can step in and play any receiver position.

17. Defensive lineman DJ Reader

2025 stats: 17 games, 28 tackles (11 solo), 4 QB hits

Twentyman: Reader has been a valuable veteran presence in the middle of Detroit's defensive line the last two seasons and he played in all 17 games this season. He was a mentor for rookie first-round pick Tyleik Williams. He was solid against the run but didn't offer a lot in terms of interior pass rush (17 hurries).

18. Cornerback Amik Robertson

2025 stats: 17 games, 52 tackles (43 solo), 2 TFL, 1 INT, 12 PD, 2 FF

Twentyman: Robertson was a rock in a fluctuating Lions secondary all season. He can play in the slot and out wide and the Lions relied on him heavily to wear multiple hats for their defense. He did allow a career-high seven touchdowns in his coverage area this season.

19. Linebacker Malcolm Rodriguez

2025 stats: 7 games, 12 tackles (9 solo), 1 TFL

Twentyman: Rodriguez returned in November from a torn ACL suffered last season and ended up playing in seven games with one start. He's been a core special teamer and key reserve at linebacker his first four seasons in Detroit.

20. Tackle Dan Skipper

2025 stats: 12 games, 0 sacks allowed, 1 penalty

Twentyman: Skipper has spent most of his eight seasons in the NFL in Detroit as a swing and reserve tackle making 16 starts over the last four seasons. He's become a cult hero to Lions fans. He said after Sunday's win over the Bears he was contemplating retirement this offseason.

21. Linebacker Grant Stuard

2025 stats: 17 games, 19 tackles (6 solo), 1 TFL

Twentyman: Stuard was brought in to be a special teams ace and finished the season leading Detroit with 13 special teams tackles on the year.

22. Safety Daniel Thomas

2025 stats: 12 games, 23 tackles (10 solo), 1 TFL, 1 PD

Twentyman: Thomas ended up making two starts at safety as Detroit was decimated by injury there. Thomas is a solid reserve having carved out a six-year career in Jacksonville and Detroit with 83 games under his belt (six starts).

23. Linebacker Ezekiel Turner

2025 stats: N/A

Twentyman: After playing in nine games as a reserve in 2024, Turner left Detroit's preseason finale in 2025 with an achilles injury that landed him on injured reserve before the 2025 season began.

24. Cornerback Rock Ya-Sin

2025 stats: 17 games, 47 tackles (27 solo), 2 QBH, 9 PD

Twentyman: Ya-Sin turned out to be a critical offseason signing by GM Brad Holmes as he played a big role in Detroit's secondary all season making six starts. Opponents completed just 51 percent of the passes thrown his way (25-for-49) with a 74.5 rating and just one touchdown allowed. He was one of Detroit's most consistent players in the secondary.

25. Tight end Shane Zylstra

2025 stats: 6 games, 3 rec., 20 yds

Twentyman: Zylstra made the team out of training camp as the No. 3 tight end but suffered an ankle injury Week 2 that landed him on IR. He returned in December to play a role after Detroit lost tight ends Sam LaPorta and Brock Wright due to injury.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/lions/mrydsuym5qqcmk8cfzo3,N,,2026-01-07 14:02:59.535315

The team will release two more injury reports, including a final injury report on Thursday with official playing status designations, before facing the Chicago Bears to open the postseason on Saturday night.

Here’s everything to know from the Packers' first injury report:

Participation report

Did not participate: CB/WR Bo Melton (knee)

Limited participation: DL Warren Brinson (foot), DB Javon Bullard (knee), LB Edgerrin Cooper (shoulder), LB Nick Niemann (pectoral), RT Zach Tom (back/knee), WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion), G John Williams (back), QB Malik Willis (right shoulder/hamstring)

Full participation: WR Matthew Golden (Achilles), DE Lukas Van Ness (foot)

Note: The Packers held a walk-through on Tuesday, so participation reports are an estimation.

Big things to know

-- A few injuries coming out of the regular season finale: defensive lineman Warren Brinson has a foot injury and was limited, slot cornerback Javon Bullard has a knee injury and was limited, receiver Matthew Golden has an Achilles injury and was a full participant and cornerback/receiver Bo Melton has a knee injury and was the team's lone DNP. Of this group, Melton -- who hurt his knee covering a punt on Sunday -- appears to be the only player in danger of not playing Saturday.

-- Bullard was able to practice Tuesday, confirming he is OK after suffering a knee injury scare in Minneapolis.

-- The Packers completely removed running back Josh Jacobs and quarterback Jordan Love from the injury report. Two of the offense's most important players are healthy entering the postseason.

-- Right tackle Zach Tom practiced, and coach Matt LaFleur said he expects Tom to return from a knee injury and play Saturday. His return would be huge for the offensive line.

-- Receiver Dontayvion Wicks remains in concussion protocol but was able to practice on Tuesday.

-- The Packers believe Malik Willis will be available as the backup quarterback, but he was limited again on Tuesday with two injuries. Desmond Ridder replaced Clayton Tune as the third quarterback on the 53-man roster.

-- The Bears also held a walk-through on Tuesday. Among those estimated as DNP: slot cornerback C.J. Gardner-Johnson (concussion), defensive end Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (concussion) and receiver Jahdae Walker (illness). The Bears designated cornerback Kyler Gordon (groin) and offensive tackle Braxton Jones for return from injured reserve, and both practiced on Tuesday.

-- It's possible Gordon could come off IR and play the slot. It's also possible Jones could come off IR and play left tackle, where rookie Ozzy Trapilo was limited on Tuesday.","https://packerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/images/smg/2024/10/16/SMGW/75708271007-57-114269.png?crop=1919,1079,x0,y0&width=1919&height=1079&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-07 14:03:02.801553

""Sometimes when it's chaos in there, it's really hard to function as a quarterback,"" Day added.
Herbert has been battered and bloodied in 2025, and the data backs up just how much he willed the Chargers to the playoffs.
""To me, it was an MVP season,"" Chargers Offensive Coordinator Greg Roman said.
""Unfortunately, it didn't go our way and there's nothing I can do to change that,"" Herbert added.","At first glance, the play seemed innocent enough.

On the Chargers first offensive drive of a Week 13 home game against the Raiders, Justin Herbert scrambled to his left and picked up a single yard before being tackled by safety Jeremy Chinn.

Herbert headed back to the huddle, relayed the play call, promptly evaded the Las Vegas pass rush and fired a 10-yard touchdown pass to Quentin Johnston.

The Bolts defense forced a punt on the next Raiders drive. But when the offense trotted back onto the field, backup Trey Lance was leading the charge.

""We scored on that drive and had no idea,"" Chargers tackle Trey Pipkins III recalled. ""Justin hit a dude but came back to the huddle and wasn't grimacing or holding his hand.

""But when he didn't come back out we were like, 'Oh, what happened to Justin?,'"" Pipkins added.

Herbert had fractured his left hand, an injury he continues to play through.

But Lance's time in the huddle lasted just eight plays as Herbert put himself back in the game on third-and-10 from the Bolts 46-yard line.

Herbert hit Keenan Allen on an out route for 10 yards and the first down. Because of course he did.

""He comes running back out there,"" Pipkins said with a laugh. ""That's just who he is. You just love having him as your quarterback.""

The Chargers will play postseason football on Sunday night in New England.

But — to put it as simply as possible — the Bolts would not be here if it wasn't for their franchise quarterback.

Herbert's toughness is perhaps the story of the Chargers 2025 season, and even the quarterback himself acknowledged the perception he can create by showing teammates, coaches and the entire organization that he's willing to keep picking himself up off the turf.

""It's just part of the game of playing quarterback and expecting you're going to get hit and it's going to be tough,"" Herbert said after a Week 3 comeback win over the Broncos. ""You've got to stay gritty and know they're going to knock you down, but you have to get back up.

""The offensive line is looking at you, the receivers and tight ends, making sure you're the leader and stepping up and getting back up, for sure,"" Herbert added.

And those who have seen it up close marvel at what the 27-year-old has been able to withstand in his sixth NFL season.

""Where would we be without 10? Oh, man. Ain't no telling, bro,"" Khalil Mack said late in the 2025 season. ""Just knowing his tenacity and his heart and the grit and resolve that he plays with … having that at the quarterback position, you don't see that often.

""Over my 12 years, he's the most unique person I've seen at that position. There's some guys who have kind of had that, but it's something different with what he's been playing with and how he's been playing through it. It's somewhat crazy but also somewhat remarkable and unbelievable.""

Mack is a future Hall of Famer who is one of the steeliest players on the entire roster.

He came back from a gruesome elbow injury in just over a month when other players might have missed half the season. Few outwork him on the field or in the weight room.

Mack said last month that Herbert is the toughest quarterback he has ever played with. After all, what other quarterback would try to stiff arm a defender with a broken hand that Herbert had surgery on just seven days prior?

""Hands down. It's not close,"" Mack said. ""I played with some tough guys but he's another step above.""

Herbert has needed that physical and mental toughness in 2025.

The Chargers lost Pro Bowl left tackle Rashawn Slater to a knee injury before the season before.

The Bolts pivoted by moving standout young tackle Joe Alt from right to left tackle to protect Herbert's blindside.

But Alt's 2025 season lasted just six games as he was lost for the year with an ankle injury.

Backup linemen such as Jamaree Salyer and Pipkins were each also lost for multiple games.

The Chargers turned to multiple different starting options at tackle, including Trevor Penning, who was acquired at the 2025 trade deadline.

Austin Deculus, who was acquired in an August trade, made four starts in front of Herbert. And Bobby Hart made seven starts in front of Herbert despite the fact that the veteran was added to the roster in October and hadn't started a game since 2021.

All in all, the Chargers rolled through 10 different starting offensive line combinations and more than 20 different five-man configurations in front of Herbert.

""The thing that amazes me about him this year is that a lot of the pockets have been under duress and it really hasn't affected him as much as it would for most quarterbacks,"" Chargers quarterbacks coach Shane Day said in December. ""He's still finding ways to make the same throws and still finding ways to win games.

""Sometimes when it's chaos in there, it's really hard to function as a quarterback,"" Day added. ""But he finds a way to do it.""

Herbert has been battered and bloodied in 2025, and the data backs up just how much he willed the Chargers to the playoffs.

Herbert was sacked 54 times in 2025, the second-most in the NFL. That total is the third-most by a quarterback who won at least 11 games in the Super Bowl era.

He was also hit a whopping 129 times, tied for second-most by a quarterback in the past 20 seasons.

There were also 268 pressures, the sixth-most a quarterback has faced since 2016. And there were 109 quick pressures, the most in the league this season.

""Justin is a competitor. He's elite. And he never ceases to amaze me season to season,"" said Chargers left guard Zion Johnson. ""Even when I got here, I knew.

""He's a warrior and he's going to give everything he's got to win,"" Johnson added. ""It's just special when you have a quarterback like that who is willing to get down and dirty and get things done.""

Pipkins added: ""We've always known that he's just the ultimate competitor. If he can get out there, he's going to do it no matter what he has going on. We knew that. But the more times it happens it's just like, 'This dude is unbelievable.' It's just awesome to always see it happen.""

Not that Herbert ever let anyone notice the constant pestering he endured in the pocket.

""There's almost something about it, he takes that hit and there's no facial expression change, there's no limp, there's no grabbing,"" Chargers Head Coach Jim Harbaugh said earlier this season. ""It's almost like it didn't even happen.

""There's something in his competitive fire where it motivates him even more,"" Harbaugh added. ""It even takes him to another notch.""

The irony in all of this?

Herbert slimmed down in the offseason, according to Day, and focused on agility rather than bulking up. The quarterback rushed for a career-best 498 yards in 16 games.

""He made a concerted effort in the offseason to change his body. In the past, maybe his strategy was to get as big as he could to withstand these hits,"" Day said. ""But this year with his offseason and training camp he said, 'I'm going to get in the best shape of my life.'

""He got leaner, faster, is setting personal records for speed,"" Day continued. ""I think his mindset is now, 'I can't just absorb hits. I need to get out of there and make plays.'

""There's more opportunities [to run], but he's also ready for those moments and has gotten his body in peak condition to do it,"" Day added.

Herbert almost certainly will not win the NFL MVP award this season. But if you truly watch the games, you'll see that Herbert belongs in that conversation.

Sure, other quarterbacks might have gaudier stats and more wins. But few players, if anyone, had to endure the shoddy circumstances Herbert did in 2025.

""To me, it was an MVP season,"" Chargers Offensive Coordinator Greg Roman said. ""With all the attrition we've had and what he's been able to do to lead the team to a playoff berth … when you look around the league with other teams that have attrition such as this, the results aren't quite the same.

""When you really go back and look at it, the way he has gutted through and found a way to will us to victory,"" Roman continued. ""Those are the games that get you in the playoffs and you don't come by it easy.""

Roman later added: ""In terms of Justin and what he's had to deal with this year, I think it's a career-defining type of year.""

Herbert, of course, is looking for his first playoff win after not getting one after the 2022 and 2024 seasons.

The quarterback recently reflected on his most-recent outing, a four-interception performance in Houston as the Bolts lost in the Wild Card Round.

""I sure hope so,"" Herbert said when asked if learned anything from the loss to the Texans. ""I think those are games that, as hard as they are to watch, you have to learn from them.

""You watch [the turnovers] individually and see what went wrong on this play, what you could've done differently,"" Herbert continued. ""It's just part of the game.

""Unfortunately, it didn't go our way and there's nothing I can do to change that,"" Herbert added. ""It's more so what can you learn from it, how can you move forward and give everything you can to put this team in a position to win.""

Herbert later revealed that the Houston loss stuck with him for the majority of the offseason.

""I think it was one of those things you continue to think about,"" Herbert said. ""There are a lot of football games you just remember, whether they're good or whether they're bad, they stick with you. I think it's great learning experience.

""No one felt worse than I did after that game and I think it's important to continue to move forward and realize that it's what happened,"" Herbert continued. ""It would be crazy of me to deny the truth of what happened and to live in this reality where if I tried to block it out, I don't think that's doing any good.

""I think just moving on and understanding what it was and attack the next game like you've always prepared for,"" Herbert added.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/chargers/vo1vtpi64mcoaehtz4n9,N,,2026-01-07 17:01:53.139249

The 27-year-old quarterback suffered a head injury in Week 16 against the Chicago Bears and was later placed under the league concussion protocol.

Love missed the Packers’ Week 17 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. He then ended up being sidelined again in Week 18 against the Minnesota Vikings despite already being cleared from the concussion protocol. Green Bay had already locked the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs heading into the Vikings game, which allowed the Packers to have their star quarterback sit out the season finale.

The Packers will face the Bears in the wild-card round on Saturday. This latest edition of this storied NFC North rivalry will have a lot more at stake, with the season on the line for both teams. The winner of Saturday’s single-elimination game will proceed to the divisional round to face either the San Francisco 49ers or the Philadelphia Eagles. It will be the end of the season for the losing team.

The good news for Green Bay is that Love is expected to start under center against the Bears. On Tuesday, the team announced that Love is off the injury report ahead of Saturday’s game.

It is worth noting that Tuesday’s practice was a walk-through for both teams, which is why the injury report is an estimation. However, the fact that Love wasn’t listed on the report falls in line with the expectation that he will be on the field on Saturday.

Packers head coach Matt LaFleur also confirmed on Tuesday that Love will be back against the Bears.

“There’s nobody else I’d rather have than Jordan,” LaFleur said.

Chicago is the No. 2 seed in the NFC, which gives them home-field advantage for Saturday’s contest. The Bears will host the Packers at Soldier Field, with kick-off scheduled for 8:00 p.m. ET.

Purpose: This study investigated the relationship between anthropometric and performance measures collected at the 2024 National Football League (NFL) Combine and playing time (PT) during the 2024 NFL regular season. Methods: Data from four anthropometric (Body Mass Index; Hand Size; Arm Length; Wingspan) and seven performance tests (40-yard Dash; 10-yard Split; Vertical Jump; Broad Jump; 3-Cone Drill; 20-Yard Shuttle; 225lb Bench Press) of 315 players were standardized into average Anthropometric Z-Scores (AZ), Performance Z-Scores (PZ) and Total Z-Scores (TZ) for analyses. PT was calculated as a player’s total number of regular season snaps during their 2024 rookie season. Pearson correlations were used to investigate the relationships (α = 0.05) between AZ, PZ, and TZ to PT. Players were also analyzed for potential relationships within each position group. Results: A significant, weak, positive correlation existed between PZ and PT (r = 0.19, p < 0.01) and TZ and PT (r = 0.20, p < 0.01) for all players. No relationship existed for AZ and PT (r = 0.02; p = 0.73). Additionally, significant relationships existed among: Offensive Line – PZ and PT (r = 0.33, p = 0.01) and TZ and PT (r = 0.35, p < 0.01); Wide Receiver – PZ and PT (r = 0.39, p = 0.03) and TZ and PT (r = 0.46, p < 0.01); Linebacker – TZ and PT (r = 0.39, p = 0.05). Conclusions: NFL Combine performance metrics may provide insight on PT, but anthropometric measurables were not related to PT. The lack of relationship within position groups indicates the NFL Combine may not be valuable in evaluating a rookie’s success on the field. Applications in Sport: Professionals who work with prospects may choose to train Combine specific techniques to maximize a prospect’s chances of playing in the NFL. However, individualized training that focuses on position specific demands or weaknesses that are not directly measured by NFL Combine tests may be more useful in increasing PT. The NFL Combine may be a useful supplement to all factors that go into an NFL team’s decision to draft a player.

INTRODUCTION

The National Football League (NFL) hosts an annual Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana of elite college football players. Only about 3% of college football players are invited to the NFL Combine and therefore represent those with the highest chance of being drafted into the NFL (4). The purpose of the NFL Combine is to allow coaches, scouts, and other team personnel representing the 32 NFL teams the opportunity to assess hundreds of players from all divisions of collegiate football.

Football has position-specific skills that are needed to excel at the highest level. However, there are similarities between each position. All positions need vertical and horizontal power, agility, and strength. During this weeklong event, players participate in a multitude of tests. These tests include anthropometric measurements (Height; Weight; Wingspan; Arm Length; Hand Size) and performance tests (40-yard dash; 10-yard split; Vertical Jump; Broad Jump; 3 Cone Drill; 20 Yard Shuttle; 225lb Bench Press). All the events in the NFL Combine have been shown to have face validity (4). NFL player personnel departments use the NFL Combine data as part of their criteria to determine whether to select a player in the upcoming NFL Draft.

While the NFL Combine tests are designed to determine that aptitude to play at the next level, research is conflicted on the ultimate usefulness of the NFL Combine in determining player performance and playing time (PT). Kuzmits and Adams (4) found no consistent significant relationship between NFL Combine tests and player performance during the years of 1999 to 2004. Research also noted that the NFL Combine from 2013 to 2015 lacked the ability to predict game performance when specifically analyzing first year game performance (3). Teramoto, Cross, and Willick (12) looked at whether the NFL Combine could predict future performance of Running Backs (RB) and Wide Receivers (WR). The results of this study were that the time on 10-yard split was the most important predictor of yards per attempt for RB while vertical jump was significantly associated with receiving yards per reception for WR. However, the measures cannot explain a large part of the variance in the future performance of RBs and WRs. Vincent et al. (15) looked at NFL Combine participants from 2005 to 2010 who then played in the NFL. Significant relationships were found between at least one NFL Combine measure and on-field success. Even though significant relationships were found the authors stated that the NFL Combine tests are only modest predictors of future performance. More recently, investigation of six physical skill tests at the NFL Combine to try and predict draft placement in the 2022 NFL Draft and showed no significant difference between drafted and nondrafted players in any of the six physical tests analyzed (14).

LaPlaca and McCullick (5) built on previous research looked at player performance from the years 2006 to 2018 and compared it to the NFL Combine from 2006 to 2016. They found that every position group, both offensive and defensive, had at least one NFL Combine test that was significantly correlated with player performance. The study made sure to disclose that even though they found significant correlations, the large sample size made it easier to find weaker correlations. A limitation that was discussed was that while the authors did use objective performance statistics such as Touchdowns scored, they also used a grading system through Pro Football Focus to determine player performance. This grading system was not purely objective because the grades are determined by multiple reviewers through the observation of game film. Therefore, the overall performance of each player was not entirely objective. Additionally, a robust study by Frank and colleagues (2) analyzed 20 years (2000-2018) of NFL Combine data and noted that for offensive positions, single measures often best predicted success, while various combinations of NFL Combine performance traits predicted success among defensive players. This study also suggested that NFL Combine data is best used in conjunction with scouting and personnel departments to supplement NFL draft decision making. Similarly, research was conducted looking at the impact of the NFL Combine on five-year performance data from the 2013-2017 NFL seasons and concluded that the NFL Combine lacked predictive ability during that timeframe (1). While historical research does exist in this field, each year provides another opportunity to determine the NFL Combine’s effectiveness in predicting success. Additionally, limited research exists discussing the relationship between NFL Combine Measurables and PT for first-year players. The primary purpose of this study was to determine if the anthropometric and performance measures of the athletes invited to the 2024 NFL Combine were related to PT during the 2024 NFL regular season.

METHODS

Participants

Participants for the data analysis in this study were college football players that participated in the 2024 NFL Combine (N = 315). Participants were also grouped by position for use of positional comparisons (Offensive Line [OL] (N = 70); Defensive Back [DB] (N = 67); Defensive Line [DL] (N = 50); Running Back [RB] (N = 29); Linebacker [LB] (N = 30); Quarterback [QB] (N = 14); Tight End [TE] (N = 16); Wide Receiver [WR] (N = 39)). All player positions were input based off their official designation at the time of the NFL Combine. Due to limited sample size (N = 6) and variations in specializations, NFL Combine athletes who were labeled Specialist (Kicker, Punter, Long Snapper) were excluded from analyses.

Procedures

Four anthropometric (Body Mass Index [BMI]; Hand Size; Arm Length; Wingspan) and seven performance measures (40-yard Dash; 10-yard Split; Vertical Jump; Broad Jump; 3-Cone Drill; 20-Yard Shuttle; 225lb Bench Press) were analyzed. BMI was calculated by the researchers using Height and Weight measurements taken at the NFL Combine. Full descriptions of the performance tests have been detailed previously by McShay (7).

The data from the NFL Combine was obtained from NFL.com/combine/tracker (8). Each participant’s scores were retrieved for every test that was completed. Standardization of data, via Z-scores, were created for every anthropometric and performance measure. The measures from the NFL Combine were standardized into averages for each player, taking each player’s combined Z-Score score and dividing by the number of NFL Combine events they participated in to account for players who did not complete every NFL Combine event. Standardized averages were created for Anthropometric Z-scores (AZ), consisting of the four anthropometric measures, Performance Z-scores (PZ), consisting of the seven performance measures, and Total Z-scores (TZ), consisting of all 11 NFL Combine measures, for analyses This method of standardization of NFL Combine data into Z-scores for analysis has previously been supported (1).

Once all NFL Combine data was standardized, researchers used Pro-football-reference.com (9) to retrieve offensive, defensive, and special teams snaps for each player during the 2024 NFL regular season. Each player’s total snap count was then combined to provide a single value to determine PT, which was used for analysis. Because of this study only requiring secondary analysis of data which is publicly available on web-based domains, which do not disclose individual’s health information, Institutional Review Board approval was not required, though the study was approved by the research institution.

Data Analyses

Pearson product moment correlations, using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS, v29.0, IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY), were used to determine the relationship (α = 0.05) between AZ, PZ, TZ to PT. Additionally, players were separated by position and Pearson product moment correlations (α = 0.05) were used to determine potential relationships within each group between AZ, PZ, and TZ, to PT. All data are presented as means ± standard deviation with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) unless otherwise stated.

RESULTS

Descriptive Statistics

Of the 321 athletes whose data were collected, 315 were used for analysis. A total of six athletes were excluded from analysis due to their position of Specialist (punter, kicker, long snapper) because only anthropometric data was collected on this group. Of the 315 athletes used for analysis, 312 (99%) completed all anthropometric measurements. There was more variability in the performance testing, with 25 (8%) completing all seven performance events, and 263 (83.5%) completing at least one performance event. When broken down by event, 220 (69.8%) completed the 40yd (4.73 ± 0.31s) with a 10yd split (1.63 ± 0.11s), 227 (72.1%) completed the VJ (34.0 ± 4.3in), 220 (69.8%) completed the BJ (117.9 ± 9.0in), 78 (24.8%) completed the 3C (7.30 ± 0.40s), 89 (28.3%) completed the PRO (4.44 ± 0.28s), and 100 (31.8%) completed the BP (21.9 ± 5.6reps). When examining snaps played over the 2024 regular season, 239 (75.9%) players went on to play at least one snap, with 224 (71.1%) averaging more than one snap per game over the course of the season.

Anthropometric Correlation Analysis

The results of the correlation analysis for AZ and PT are presented in Figure 1. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients were calculated for the relationship between average AZ and PT for all players and separated by position group. No significant overall relationship existed for AZ and PT (n = 312; r = 0.02; p = 0.73).

Additionally, no significant relationships existed among position groups: OL (n = 70; r = 0.13; p = 0.29); RB (n = 29; r = 0.21; p = 0.29); WR (n = 37; r = 0.24; p = 0.16); TE (n = 16; r = 0.39; p = 0.14); QB (n = 13; r = 0.02; p = 0.95); DL (n = 50; r = -0.10; p = 0.52); LB (n = 30; r = 0.19; p = 0.33); DB (n = 67; r = -0.02; p = 0.89).

Performance Correlation Analysis

The results of the correlation analysis for PZ and PT are presented in Figure 2. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients were calculated for the relationship between average PZ and PT for all players and separated by position group. A significant, weak, positive correlation existed between PZ and PT (n = 263; r = 0.19, 95%CI [0.07, 0.31]; p < 0.01). The positive direction of this relationship indicates that players who performed better at the NFL Combine played more snaps during the 2024 NFL regular season.

When separated by position groups, significant, positive relationships existed for the following groups: OL (n = 61; r = 0.33, 95%CI [0.09, 0.54]; p = 0.01); WR (n = 34; r = 0.39, 95%CI [0.06, 0.65]; p = 0.03). The positive direction of these relationships indicates that OL and WR who performed better at the NFL Combine accumulated more snaps during the 2024 NFL Regular season. No significant correlations were noted for: RB (n = 25; r = 0.31; p = 0.14); TE (n = 12; r = 0.07; p = 0.15); QB (n = 7; r = -0.39; p = 0.40); DL (n = 43; r = 0.30; p = 0.06); LB (n = 26; r = 0.31; p = 0.13); DB (n = 55; r = -0.02; p = 0.89).

Total Correlation Analysis

The results of the correlation analysis for TZ and PT are presented in Figure 3. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients were calculated for the relationship between average TZ and PT for all players and separated by position group. A significant, weak, positive correlation existed between TZ and PT (r = 0.20, 95%CI [0.08, 0.31]; p < 0.01) for all players. The positive direction of this relationship indicates that players who had higher average TZ scores played more snaps in the 2024 NFL regular season.

When separated by position groups, significant, positive relationships existed for the following groups: OL (n = 61; r = 0.35, 95%CI [0.11, 0.56]; p < 0.01); WR (n = 34; r = 0.46, 95%CI [0.15, 0.69]; p < 0.01); LB (n = 26; r = 0.39, 95%CI [0.01, 0.68]; p = 0.05). The positive direction of these relationships indicates that players in these position groups who had higher average AZ scores played more snaps in the 2024 NFL Regular season. No significant correlations were noted for: RB (n = 25; r = 0.31; p = 0.14); TE (n = 12; r = 0.07; p = 0.85); QB (n = 7; r = -0.24; p = 0.61); DL (n = 43; r = 0.30; p = 0.06); DB (n = 55; r = 0.06; p = 0.70).

Discussion

The main finding of this study is that PZ and TZ may have a weak relationship to PT in a player’s first year in the NFL. There was no relationship between a player’s AZ and subsequent PT across all athletes nor when separated by position group. The study did find a significant weak positive correlation between average PZ and PT for all players. However, when separated by position groups significant, positive relationships existed for OL and WR. Finally, there was a significant weak positive correlation between TZ and PT for all players. When separated by position groups, significant, positive relationships existed for OL, WR, and LB.

There could be many reasons why these relationships exist for WR, LB, and OL. Previous movement analysis research for NFL players by position found that WR had highest in-game velocity and highest total running volume by an offensive position (6). Therefore, the 40-yard dash and 10-yard split may carry more importance among WR. The same study showed that LB had the most high-velocity efforts and high-velocity distance in game compared to all other positions. LB also showed the largest variability across player-games which is likely due to the roles that LB perform which include rushing the QB, play in space and cover offensive players, or primarily to tackle an opponent. Additionally, OL noted a positive relationship in the current study, with better NFL Combine performances leading to more PT. While previous research (11) has noted that OL have worse NFL Combine values compared to other positions, the nature of the OL position may lend itself to more direct relationships from NFL Combine performance, since these athletes require multidirectional power over limited space. The positional findings in the current study do support previous research that noted relationships between NFL Combine performance metrics and PT among WR (40-yard Dash, Vertical Jump), LB (40-yard Dash, 20-yd Shuttle) and OL (20-yard Shuttle, Vertical Jump) (1, 2).

The NFL is not the only sport that uses a combine to test and evaluate future players’ abilities. Teramoto et al. (13), investigated the National Basketball Association (NBA) scouting Combine to determine whether the NBA Combine could predict PT. The study showed that the NBA Combine metrics had minimal correlation with long-term performance. In the NBA, it was found that certain anthropometrics had slightly better predictive power than athletic tests, which contrasts with what researchers found about the 2024 NFL Combine. Both in the NFL and NBA Combine researchers have proposed that performance in college or in game is the biggest predictor of draft position and future performance (11, 13).

There are limitations associated with this study. As reported in the results only 25 (8%) of all prospects completed all seven performance events. Increasingly, players are opting out of some or all the NFL Combine process, due to injury concern, agent decision, recovering from an injury during the season, or to focus on performing well at individual workouts, where more variables can be controlled by that athlete. In the season being analyzed in this study, five of the first six picks in the NFL Draft did not participate in the NFL Combine process, which could impact these findings. A larger, more complete sample from all NFL Combine athletes would comprise a better representation of their athletic performance. Finally, players that played zero snaps their first year due to injury were included in analysis, due to limitations among researchers to determine the extent of every injury or whether a player was not on the field due to injury or coaching decisions. A player that may have had strong AZ, PZ, and TZ scores, but did not play during their rookie season because of injury, which would have impacted the relationship between those variables and PT.

CONCLUSIONS

Many studies have been conducted over the last 20 years to determine if and how NFL Combine measurables can predict performance in the NFL (1-6, 10, 12, 14, 15). These studies have found mostly found minimal relationships overall, though stronger relationships among certain position groups. Despite the general scientific consensus that the NFL Combine is not a strong predictor of future NFL success, a multitude of NFL Combine “prep courses” exist, with athletes paying for training specifically to improve in NFL Combine measurables. There has been scientific skepticism about these courses and their impact on performance at the NFL Combine and its translation to improved draft status or playing time. While these courses claim that they will improve an athlete’s chance of getting drafted, there is currently no scientific evidence to these claims (1, 4, 10). Training programs that focus on a prospect’s position specific demands or individual weaknesses that are not directly measured by NFL Combine tests may be more useful in increasing PT for that athlete. The results of the current study support the previous work in the literature, but do note that some position groups (OL, WR, LB) may benefit by improving NFL Combine-specific performance in the lead up to the NFL Combine and Draft.

APPLICATIONS IN SPORT

The results from the current study suggest PT among NFL rookies during the 2024 regular season could not be strongly predicted with data collected during the NFL Combine. However, due to the relationships that were found, specifically withing certain position groups, it may be important for athletes in those positions to train specifically for those performance tests to have a better chance at playing in their first year. The data can be important for NFL player personnel departments who may use data collected during the NFL Combine to influence drafting decisions. Due to the significant, but variable, nature of the relationships found in the current study, it appears that the NFL Combine may be a useful supplement to scouting, film analysis, interviews, and other factors that go into an NFL team’s decision to draft a player. However, it is apparent that there is more to determining PT during a rookie season than just superlative measurables collected during the NFL Combine.",https://thesportjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Sport-Journal-Temp-Logo-185-x-75-px-150x75-1.png,N,,2026-01-07 09:59:51.262266

Rather than practicing from Wednesday to Friday, they'll hold a walkthrough on Tuesday, followed by practices on Wednesday and Thursday.

Because they didn't practice today, the Rams' initial injury report is an estimation of players' participation. Davante Adams is making his way back from a hamstring injury that has kept him out for the last three weeks, but he's expected to return on Saturday. He was a full participant in practice for the first time since going down in Week 15.

Jordan Whittington is dealing with a knee injury suffered in Sunday's win over the Cardinals, so his status will be monitored during the week. Quentin Lake is also expected to return and was a full participant on Tuesday, while Kevin Dotson was listed as a non-participant once again to start the week; Sean McVay is unsure if he'll play against the Panthers.

Terrance Ferguson, who's expected to play in Saturday's game, was held out on Tuesday, but McVay previously said the team would be smart with his hamstring injury early in the week. Josh Wallace didn’t participate, either, and both Braden Fiske and Tyler Higbee were limited, too.

J.J. McCarthy took himself out of Sunday's game due to a hand injury.","In the NFL, 16 teams get to finish their regular seasons with a win (since 2002 when the league expanded to 32 teams). Those that reach the postseason – 14 of them to be exact (since 2020) – battle it out for the opportunity to end their season with the ultimate victory.

While the Minnesota Vikings will miss the postseason for the second time in three seasons, they finished the year in strong fashion. On Sunday, Minnesota defeated Green Bay 16-3; not only did the Vikings bookend a decade of games at U.S. Bank Stadium with a Border Battle victory over the Packers (the opponent in the venue's inaugural game), they closed the season on a five-game winning streak to finish the year with a 9-8 record.

Although a team experiencing a late-season hot streak is nothing new, only 11 NFL teams since 2020 have concluded their regular-season schedules with a win streak of five-plus games. The Vikings were one of four teams this season to finish the year on a heater, joining the Seahawks (seven consecutive wins), Jaguars (eight consecutive) and Texans (nine consecutive).

Additionally, the Vikings have recorded a win streak of five games or more in each of Kevin O'Connell's first four seasons as a head coach. According to NFL Media Research, that ties former St. Louis Rams Head Coach Mike Martz for the second-longest such streak to start a coaching career and it is the longest active streak in the league. Martz accomplished the feat with the Rams from 2000-2003.

J.J. McCarthy started Sunday's finale and was playing well against a Green Bay team resting most of its key players, but McCarthy left in the third quarter after appearing to aggravate his throwing-hand injury that caused him to miss Week 17's game. That injury in and of itself is not the story. It will heal over the coming months, just like the other injuries McCarthy has suffered over the past couple years. But the long-term questions about his constitution won't let up until he gets through a season relatively unscathed, and how much can Minnesota really trust him as the sole protector of the position? They finished the season 9-8 with a five-game win streak, so there's evidence to suggest the Vikings could be in contention a year from now, even with the questions at QB and the possibility of [Defensive Coordinator] Brian Flores leaving. How Minnesota approaches the offseason will be fascinating and telling.

J.J. McCarthy took himself out of Sunday's game due to a hand injury. Like everything else about McCarthy, it's sure to start a conversation about the second-year quarterback. McCarthy has played only 10 games in his career. He improved to 6-4 in those games, but he finished the season 38th among quarterbacks in EPA per dropback (minus-0.14). The Vikings don't have any other obvious answers at the position, but they need some.

Winning five in a row to end the season is a positive and also a reminder of what might have been, had Minnesota's quarterback play been even average. The Vikings approach at quarterback will be watched closely. Perhaps just as important will be if Defensive Coordinator Brian Flores returns. He should get some head-coaching interviews, and he could conceivably leave as a coordinator elsewhere since his contract is up.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/ltjcuksypaztnxjc5iah,N,,2026-01-07 12:00:39.332845

The Fox injury, though, has to factor into the team’s thinking.","NEW YORK — The New York Rangers were dealt a pair of injury blows on Tuesday, as Adam Fox will go on long-term injured reserve and Igor Shesterkin will go on injured reserve, a league source said. Fox will be reevaluated when eligible to come off LTIR, and Shesterkin will continue to be evaluated.

Fox, who returned from an upper-body injury Dec. 31, did not suffer any noticeable injury during Monday’s 3-2 loss to the Mammoth, though he did not play in overtime. He was for the Rangers’ final power play of the game and last appeared with 59 seconds left. The Rangers have already seen how difficult life is without him — especially on the power play — and will now face another prolonged stretch with him gone. He has 28 points in 30 games this season and has boasted strong underlying numbers.

By going on long-term injured reserve, Fox has to miss 10 games and 24 days. That means the earliest he can return is Jan. 31 against Pittsburgh. In the aftermath of Fox’s injury, the team called up Scott Morrow from AHL Hartford. Coach Mike Sullivan used him on the power play the last time Fox was out.

The Rangers went 6-5-3 when Fox was dealing with his shoulder injury and were outscored 39-34. The power play struggled mightily, converting on only 15 percent of its chances. (It scored on five of eight chances in the past three games with Fox back.)

Shesterkin suffered his injury in the first period Monday when Utah’s JJ Peterka drove to the net. The Mammoth forward made marginal contact with Shesterkin, but the goalie fell backwards into the net and slammed his blocker on the ice in pain. Rangers defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov and trainer Andy Hosler helped him off the ice. The goalie did not put any weight on his left leg. The injury appeared not to stem from the Peterka contact; Shesterkin’s left side never made contact with the Utah forward.

Losing Shesterkin for any time is a massive blow for the Rangers. Though the team’s defense has improved this season compared to 2024-25, the Rangers still rely heavily on their goaltending. Shesterkin, the Vezina Trophy winner as the NHL’s best goaltender in 2022, signed the richest goalie contract in history last season: an eight-year, $11.5 million average annual value deal. He’s in the first year of that contract.

Jonathan Quick will take on added responsibility with Shesterkin out. He has a .919 save percentage in 11 games this season. The 39-year-old two-time Stanley Cup winner has been an invaluable presence in the New York dressing room and has been strong as the No. 2 goalie, but needing him to take on a starter’s workload is a big ask. The last time he started at least 40 games in a season was 2022-23, and he had an .882 save percentage that year in 41 games with the Kings and Golden Knights.

The Rangers called up journeyman goalie Spencer Martin, who started the year in the KHL before signing with the Rangers. He has a .903 save percentage in three games. By calling him up, the Rangers passed over prospect Dylan Garand, who has a .908 save percentage in 17 games. That could potentially be to keep him in more consistent game action.

Depending on how badly the Rangers want to stay in the playoff picture, president and general manager Chris Drury could look to the trade market. Someone like Laurent Brossoit, a pending unrestricted free agent, could be an option with a low acquisition cost. He’s making his way back from double hip surgery and playing for AHL Rockford, where he has a .901 save percentage in six games. He has a .911 save percentage in 140 career games. His $3.3 million cap hit through the end of the season could make a deal tough, though Chicago could retain in a trade. Buffalo is currently carrying three goalies, so perhaps the Rangers could try to nab Alex Lyon from the Sabres.

The Fox injury, though, has to factor into the team’s thinking. New York is in last place in the East by points percentage, so trading prospects or draft picks — even lower-value ones — for a stopgap goalie simply might not make sense this season. The team won’t make the playoffs simply by staying afloat in the coming weeks: It has to make up ground, and that’s difficult for a team to do without arguably its two most important players.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/06124329/GettyImages-2254830755-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-07 13:02:16.715480

Three AFC teams sit as five points better than average, but I think two could be a point high, if not more.
If he falls apart in this spot and Allen doesn't, then the Bills can certainly win this game.
Chargers at Patriots If I had to pick a game where the spread is probably right, it would be Packers-Bears.
I'm trying not to underrate the Steelers, and with their excellent home-field advantage my spread projection for this game is Pittsburgh -1.","We talked about how the market was treating teams potentially resting players last week in five games and went 4-1 on those picks, and now we turn from the games that mean little to the games that mean everything. The playoffs start Saturday with the Rams heading to Carolina to face a Panthers team that is a double-digit underdog in the matchup, a monster spread and one that has been impossible to cover in the past.

Think that's an exaggeration? Home underdogs of four points or more in playoff games are 9-0 ATS over the last 50 years and while the previous three all covered in a losing effort, the previous six all won outright. If you look at games where a team is catching more than seven points, then we have three previous examples, all coming in the last 15 years.

The most recent underdog of at least four points came during the 2020 playoffs when Tom Brady went to Washington to face a 7-9 team led by Taylor Heinicke as 10-point favorites. A field goal late in the first half got the Bucs just outside the number with an 18-7 halftime lead and then they did it again by extending their lead to 28-16 in the fourth quarter, but Washington scored a late TD and a 31-23 final left them with the cover.

Skipping two 4.5-point underdogs that covered, our second huge home dog came in the 2011 playoffs when Mike Tomlin took the best defense in the league into Denver to face a questionable Broncos offense led by Tim Tebow, which caused the home team to be catching 7.5 points. The Broncos led from the second quarter until late in the fourth when the Steelers tied the game, then an 80-yard TD to Demaryius Thomas gave Denver the outright win.

The year prior, the Saints marched into Seattle as 10-point favorites against a 7-9 Seahawks team that like the Broncos had been unimpressive on both sides of the ball entering the postseason. The Saints managed a 10-point lead early before the Seahawks stormed back and led the final 31 minutes of the game, emphasizing their victory with the unforgettable Beast Quake touchdown by Marshawn Lynch late in the 41-36 win.

So what's the takeaway? To me, it is incredibly hard for any team to walk into an opposing stadium as no-doubt winners and put together a performance to meet expectations, as you have to play a near-perfect game to cover such a big number on the road against a team -- even a mediocre team -- that was able to win its division. The 2020 Bucs went on to win the Super Bowl in dominant fashion against the Chiefs but when they failed to cover in the wild card round, they had four drives stall in the red zone and result in field goals and lost a fumble on another drive that was near field goal range.

The Rams are similar to that Bucs team with an elite QB late in his career paired with some great weapons and facing a team with a subpar offense that won a bad division, although that Washington team had a better defense than Carolina. My power ratings say this spread should be Rams -7, and I would certainly expect a result around that number more than I would covering as double-digit road favorites considering the history of those teams in the playoffs.

I'll have my spread picks this week at SportsLine, where members are able to get access to all my picks throughout the week as they're made and hopefully take advantage of some good line value.

Let's dive into our betting power ratings and then take a look at what the spread should be for every other game during Super Wild Card Weekend.

I have given a bump to the Eagles, Bills, Chargers and Packers with those four teams getting key players rest in Week 18 as that really seems to matter more often than not, especially for teams as beat up as those four rosters. The Rams and Seahawks stay in their own tier despite not resting players and while the gap is notable between them and the next tier, it's no so big that I think rematch -- potentially in the NFC Championship if the 49ers or Packers win this week -- is inevitable.

I feel like the Jaguars are the best team in the AFC right now but aren't being treated as such by the market, and I'm surprised they're underdogs to the Bills. I'm putting the Eagles alongside Jacksonville with the expectation the offense will be better with Lane Johnson expected to return this week. They don't have the offense of the Rams or the defense of the Seahawks, but they are probably better balanced than either so even at 5.5, I might have them a little low.

Three AFC teams sit as five points better than average, but I think two could be a point high, if not more. I gave the Bills credit for the rest and hopefully they'll be in as good shape for their game against Jacksonville as they've been in months from a health perspective, but that remains to be seen. The Patriots have not faced many tough offenses this year, splitting their games with a beat-up Bills squad while edging out a Bucs team at the beginning of its downturn and a Ravens team that lost Lamar Jackson midgame. Both of those teams didn't make the playoffs, so the only playoff teams New England has faced are the Bills, Steelers and Panthers.

The Chargers are going to be at the mercy of matchups moving forward with their patchwork offensive line, but Justin Herbert has overcome those limitations in the past and the defense is in top form, so I'm not ruling out Jim Harbaugh's team from making some noise in the postseason. I give them a slight edge over a less-proven Houston offense.

I have the 49ers and Packers side by side as I don't know what we're going to get from either, but I'm almost certain it'll be tied to player availability. San Francisco absolutely needs Trent Williams back against that Philadelphia front and comments from the weekend make it sound like he would've had a chance to play if the Week 18 game fell on Sunday, so I'd give him better than even odds to be back for the matchup. The Packers defense might be a major problem with the injuries it has sustained, so we'll see if Jordan Love and the offensive unit can catch fire and that possibility has me profiling those two NFC wild card teams similarly.

I'm not putting much confidence in a Bears team that beat expectations to win the division but looked mediocre for much of the regular season finale against the Lions at home. Chicago certainly has the feel of a one-and-done team who might be in for bigger things next season. I'm giving the Steelers a boost with T.J. Watt back and DK Metcalf returning for the wild-card round, and I feel like the easy out is to just keep underestimating them because the talent on paper might not be on par with many of the other playoff teams.

The Panthers, even as a below-average overall team, have a fighter's chance at beating a team they've already beat once at home, and we talked about the history of big road favorites above. Now, let's get into the other matchups.

Packers at Bears

This game is functionally a pick 'em with the Packers only favored on the money line by a few cents. My ratings give the Bears a slightly better chance to win as they would project a spread of Bears -1.5, and that's acknowledging Chicago has had one of the better home field advantages in the league recently. The Bears were 5-3 ATS at home this year but missed a cover in the win over the Giants by a half-point, and their other two ATS losses were close games against the Vikings to open the season and the Lions to close it.

I also think there's a bit of wiggle room to reduce the Packers' rating downward as my current number projects good health for the offense coming off the rest week. The defense lost one of the best edge rushers in the league in Micah Parsons, and the Devonte Wyatt injury leaves them a mess on the interior. Nate Hobbs went on IR late in the year and Trevon Diggs is trying to replace him on the fly. The defense may have avoided another disaster after Jevon Holland left the Week 18 game with a knee injury, but that's another issue a player has to play through. That's before we get to an offense that's lost Elgton Jenkins at center and is now hoping Zach Tom returns and is able to play up to his typical high level at right tackle, with key target Tucker Kraft also out and Josh Jacobs playing through injury much of the year.

We've seen plenty of upstarts with young quarterbacks like the Packers, Texans and Jaguars win a playoff game in their first trip to the postseason with that guy under center, so I'm not counting the Bears out just because they're upstarts. But it's going to take more consistency on both sides of the ball to get it done.

Bills at Jaguars

The market has made the Bills a slight 1.5-point favorite in this game, saying that Josh Allen is enough to overcome home field advantage and overall team strength. My ratings of course disagree, as I have the Jaguars as the better team on a neutral field and project them as a 2.5-point favorite in this game. That's even with giving the Bills a bump for resting players in Week 18.

The Bills have been mostly successful in games where they can run the ball, like the blowout win over the Jets with their starters resting, and not as successful in games where they can't run the ball, as happened in the loss to the Eagles the previous week. Allen has not been able to rely on his passing-game weapons as much, and his 25 passing touchdowns are the fewest since his first full season as starter. He's also been sacked more than ever, 40 times in all and on 8% of dropbacks where he didn't run for positive yards, which is well above its highest point since 2019. The defense has been its own issue, particularly defending the run, with six opponents rushing for at least 189 yards as the Bills finished 30th in yards per rush allowed. I already think I'm being aggressively positive with their rating, so that suggests the market hasn't bought into Jacksonville at all.

The Jaguars are a team that plays sound run defense with a quarterback that was playing like a darkhorse MVP candidate down the stretch, potentially shortening the gap between him and Allen. If he falls apart in this spot and Allen doesn't, then the Bills can certainly win this game. Take away the QBs and I see a much stronger roster on both sides of the ball from the home team.

49ers at Eagles

This line has seen some early movement to the Eagles, and I think that's right. My ratings give them a boost for the rest edge after last week and are counting on them to wipe away their inconsistency on offense from the regular season, and I have them as three points better than the 49ers, who like the Patriots played a relatively easy schedule this year, on a neutral field. In Philadelphia, my spread projection is Eagles -5.5.

An offensive lineman is never going to win MVP, but two tackles in this game certainly have a case to do so. The Eagles' season turned negative as usual after the Lane Johnson injury as they lost their next three games, beat two pushovers and then edged out the Bills in a bad game for the offense considering the opponent. The 49ers offense in the biggest spot of the year was non-functional without Trent Williams on the field in Week 18. It appears both guys are trending toward playing in this matchup, which is good news for getting the best possible version of these teams and especially for avoiding the worst. While the 49ers defense did their part in that game last week, they still have the potential to be the team's fatal flaw with how they played down the stretch.

For that to happen, the Eagles offense will need to finally pull it all together and start to look like the attack that ran through the playoffs last year before obliterating the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. They ranked just 19th in scoring offense and an unbelievable 23rd in yards per rush considering how unstoppable the ground game was last season. A healthy offensive line could help them get closer to that level than they've been for much of the season.

Chargers at Patriots

If I had to pick a game where the spread is probably right, it would be Packers-Bears. But this would be a close second. I think I'm pretty aggressive with my rating for both teams, and my spread projection for this matchup is Patriots -4.

I probably have the Chargers rated higher than most at 3.5 points better than average, which is in part due to them getting to rest last week. But I also think the team isn't getting enough credit for a defense that has held nine of its last 10 opponents to 20 points or fewer. That run includes four playoff teams, stopping a Broncos team fighting for the No. 1 seed from scoring an offensive touchdown while recovering from two early touchdowns allowed to Houston the previous week to keep the team in the game. They also generated five turnovers in an overtime win over the Eagles and three in a dominant victory against Pittsburgh. Their one bad performance in this stretch came against the Jaguars, who might be the hottest team in football.

There are plenty of Patriots naysayers due to their easy schedule but you can only beat who you play, and they have top-four scoring offenses and defenses on the season. The question is whether they have the edge rushers to take advantage of the Chargers' weakness at tackle, because if they don't and Justin Herbert can lead the team to 20 points, it might be enough to score the upset with how well the Chargers defense is playing.

Texans at Steelers

This game may keep bouncing between 3 and 3.5 as the market looks to buy in to the Texans and fade the Steelers, but maybe it shouldn't. Home underdogs between 3-4 points are 5-2 ATS in the last 10 years, and going back to our initial look at the Rams-Panthers game, all home 'dogs of three points or more are 10-3-1 ATS since the 2011 playoffs and 18-9-1 ATS since 1981. I'm trying not to underrate the Steelers, and with their excellent home-field advantage my spread projection for this game is Pittsburgh -1.

For how the Steelers offense is judged based on the personnel on paper, they've scored 25+ points in nine of their last 12 games, only getting shut down by the Browns and Chargers on the road and a Bills team that ran all over them. The Texans defense is second to none so it's possible we see a similar Pittsburgh offensive outing to what we saw in those Browns and Chargers games, but they also scored 23-25 points in three straight home games earlier in the year against the Vikings, Browns and Packers. The Texans also just gave up 30 points against Riley Leonard despite getting three takeaways, so they're not exactly in their best form.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/05/1e4e540c-5631-4b94-b3a3-59cccf8f3033/thumbnail/1200x675/cb457fbc3c5a18da849abf2b35679270/chuba-hubbard-panthers-rams.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 16:00:36.284471

Matt Prater reinjured his quad muscle during last Sunday’s victory over the Jets and his availability for Sunday’s AFC wildcard playoff game at Jacksonville is in question.

On Monday, coach Sean McDermott confirmed that, “Matt Prater suffered a little bit of an injury yesterday, as you guys saw it unfold during the game. He’s more day-to-day, which is a good sign, but we’re still going to more than likely bring some kickers in (Tuesday) for a workout. Kind of work with two plans, one where he’s able to go come Sunday and one where he’s perhaps not able to go.”

Bills kicker woes have been season long

The Bills have been scrambling at kicker all season. Tyler Bass suffered a pelvic injury in training camp and after appearing in one preseason game, he went on injured reserve where he has remained all season, ultimately undergoing surgery several weeks ago.

Prater was signed just before the season and has done a fine job filling in as he has made 18 of 20 field goals and 46 of 49 extra points. However, he originally hurt his quad muscle the week of the Cleveland game and missed the next two, so Michael Badgley was signed to the practice squad.

In those two games, Badgley missed two extra points including one against the Eagles that very likely cost the Bills a chance to win, a Week 17 loss that ultimately cost them the No. 5 seed and a wild-card trip to Pittsburgh to play a Steelers team that is inferior to Jacksonville.

Prater returned against New York but could not finish after making three extra points and kicking off three times, so that has led them to Wright as a contingency plan.

What to know about Matthew Wright

Wright has kicked in the NFL for eight different teams since entering the league in 2019, most recently for the Titans, Commanders and Texans this season and made all five field goals and four extra points that he attempted. For his career he has made 60 of 68 field goals.

In his last appearance on Nov. 16, Wright kicked a 35-yard field goal as time expired to give Houston a 16-13 victory over Tennessee. He was released days later when the Texans' regular kicker, Ka'imi Fairbarn, returned from an injury.

Obviously, this is not ideal for the Bills, especially in a playoff game that is expected to be close and could hinge on kick because regardless of whether Wright or Prater, a 41-year-old with, at minimum, a sore leg, is the kicker, neither is a match for the Jaguars’ Cam Little who is a legitimate weapon and one of the best in the NFL.

In his first two seasons Little has made 57 of 63 field goal attempts (90.5%) and 77 of 78 extra points (98.7%). From 50 yards and beyond he is 28 of 31 and that includes the two longest kicks in NFL history, a 68-yarder on Nov. 2 indoors against the Raiders, and a 67-yarder outdoors at home against the Titans last week.

This year, Little has made 30 of 34 field goals including his last 20, and when he was asked about that last Sunday he said, “Don’t say it too loud, man! Let’s relax! No, but 20 in a row, we’re at a good spot. I think our unit is doing a really good job like they always do.”

At 22 years old, the 2024 sixth-round draft pick is the youngest kicker in league history to reach 50 career field goals, nearly a full year ahead of when Kansas City’s Harrison Butker did that early in his second season in 2018.

With Little’s howitzer of a leg, if you send a kickoff into the end zone for a touchback against the Jaguars and they start a drive at the 35, they’re no more than two first downs away from being in Little’s range which puts an enormous amount of pressure on the opposing defense if a game comes down to the wire.","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/17/SLST/87313664007-usatsi-27607280.jpg?crop=4533,2550,x0,y470&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-07 11:01:57.066012

Tate is projected as a top-10 pick in ESPN analyst Mel Kiper's current rankings, the latest in a gilded line of high-end Buckeye receivers. Tate caught 51 passes for 875 yards and nine touchdowns for Ohio State this year.

He did that in 11 games, as he missed three games because of injury. He flashed dominance throughout the year, as he had 183 yards receiving against Minnesota, five catches for 82 yards and a touchdown against Michigan, and 124 yards and a touchdown against Penn State.

Now, the Super Bowl-winning former Seahawks quarterback is facing a different kind of spotlight after revealing he played a key 2025 game for the New York Giants with what he described as a Grade 2 hamstring tear, an injury that did not appear on the team’s official injury reports. And Reuters noted an NFL investigation into “who knew what” is “likely forthcoming,” given the league’s sensitivity around injury transparency and gambling-related integrity concerns.

Wilson Says the Hamstring Tear Happened Right Before Week 2

Wilson told reporters he tore his hamstring on the final play of a Friday practice ahead of the Giants’ Week 2 matchup with the Dallas Cowboys, and said he felt he couldn’t disclose it. He added he sought treatment quietly — including work at the Dallas Mavericks’ facility — while trying to stay functional enough to play.

Despite the claimed limitation, Wilson put up a massive passing day in that Week 2 overtime loss, throwing for 450 yards and three touchdowns as New York fell 40-37.

Wilson’s hamstring issue never showed up on the Giants’ injury report that season, per the Reuters report, with his only listed ailment coming in Week 5 (ankle) while still practicing fully.

Key details (from Reuters):

Wilson said it was a “Grade 2” tear suffered before Week 2.

The injury was not on official Giants injury reports, per Reuters.

Reuters said an NFL investigation is “likely forthcoming.”

Why the Injury Report Angle Could Draw League Scrutiny

The NFL’s injury reporting rules are designed to protect public confidence and ensure “full and complete information on player availability,” with potential discipline for violations.

That’s why Wilson’s comments immediately raise uncomfortable questions: If the Giants knew, why wasn’t it reported? If the Giants didn’t know, how did a quarterback play through a significant injury without team awareness? Reuters reported it was unclear who, if anyone, in the organization was aware, but still flagged the likelihood of a league review, especially with broader sports attention on insider information and gambling concerns.

It’s also worth noting a Grade 2 hamstring tear can be a multi-week (sometimes longer) recovery type of injury in many cases, which makes the decision-making around availability and reporting even more sensitive.

What It Means for Wilson and Why Seahawks Fans Still Care

For Seahawks fans, Wilson’s name still moves traffic because his Seattle run is the defining chapter of his career: he won a Super Bowl, made multiple Pro Bowls, and became one of the franchise’s most important players before leaving after the 2021 season.

This story matters today for two reasons:

It’s a league-integrity storyline, not just an injury anecdote. If the NFL looks into it, the outcome could involve explanations from New York, or at minimum, more reporting about what the league believes happened behind the scenes.

Wilson is still trying to play in 2026. Reuters reported he insisted he plans to continue his career after his one-year Giants stint ended.

Seahawks inevitably will wonder if Wilson will retire as a Seahawk, so when his career enters the twilight, fans pay especially close attention.

What Happens Next

If this turns into a true “serial” NFL story, the next developments to watch are straightforward: any comment from the Giants, any statement from the league office, and any follow-up reporting that clarifies whether the injury was known internally or not.

Either way, Wilson’s admission has already reframed his 2025 season, and put a Seahawks legend back in the news cycle for reasons that go far beyond a box score.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2251906998.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780,N,,2026-01-07 09:59:58.434359

It is no secret these two NFL franchises not only know but have a strong dislike for each other. As two of the oldest franchises in the NFL, Green Bay and Chicago have met 212 times, with the Packers leading the series 109-97-6.

When talking about the history of the NFL, it is hard to name other franchises that have impacted the game more than these two. From Curly Lambeau to George Halas, from Vince Lombardi to Gale Sayers, from Bart Starr to Walter Payton, from Brett Favre to Brian Urlacher, and eventually Aaron Rodgers, the Bears (No. 1) and the Packers (No. 2) have the most Hall of Famers by a franchise in the NFL.

On top of that, Green Bay is at the top of the list of the franchises with the most wins in NFL history at 819. Who is second on that list? The Chicago Bears, with 809.

Adding to the history, the Packers stand alone as the NFL franchise with the most championships at 13, while Chicago places second with nine.

With all of the history and the 212 matchups between these two longtime rivals, it is strange that there have only been two playoff matchups in history. This week will mark the third installment of the series.

After sitting a majority of its starters in Week 18, Green Bay enters the Wild Card matchup on a four-game losing streak but relatively healthier than the last time these two teams met. As for Chicago, the Bears have enjoyed one of the franchise’s better seasons in recent memory and are looking to continue that on the back of second-year quarterback Caleb Williams.

“You definitely stick with your process that you believe in,” said Packers head coach Matt LaFleur, on how the Packers will change practice to get ready for the playoffs. “I think everybody just has to understand the magnitude of the playoffs and what that brings in regards to there is a finality to it, so you have to go play your best ball.”

With the NFL’s oldest rivalry set for matchup 213, the playoff record for both teams in the series is 1-1.

The first playoff matchup between the two teams came in 1941 during the Western Divisional Playoff. In that game Chicago came away victorious by a score of 33-14.

Chicago’s victory was fueled by a strong rushing effort from George McAfee and Norm Standlee, who finished with a combined 198 yards and two touchdowns on 29 carries. Bears Hall of Fame quarterback Sid Luckman finished the game completing 4-of-9 passes for 41 yards.

For Green Bay, quarterback Cecil Isbell completed 8-of-19 passes for 107 yards and a touchdown. Clarke Hinkle led the rushing attack for the Packers, totaling 17 yards and a touchdown on nine carries, while Tony Canadeo was held to 7 yards on five carries. Don Hutson recorded just 19 yards on one reception as well.

The win vaulted Chicago to the NFL Championship, where it would take down the New York Giants in a 37-9 win, sealing the franchise’s fifth championship.

Seventy years later, the two teams met for the second iteration of the rivalry in the playoffs, during the 2010-11 NFC Championship. In a cold January game in Chicago, Green Bay came out on top, winning 21-14.

Rodgers finished the game completing 17-of-30 passes for 244 yards but threw two interceptions. James Starks proved to be the spark for the Packers offense; the running back finished the game with 74 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries.

For Chicago, quarterback Jay Cutler was forced out of the game after completing 6-of-14 passes for 80 yards. In replacement, Caleb Hanie completed 13-of-20 passes for 153 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.

With Green Bay up 14-7 late in the fourth quarter, defensive lineman B.J. Raji came away with one of the most iconic plays in the rivalry, as he intercepted Hanie and returned it back 18 yards for a touchdown, giving the Packers a two-score lead and ultimately the insurance that Green Bay needed to win.

The Packers eventually knocked off the Pittsburgh Steelers in the ensuing Super Bowl, sealing the franchise’s 13th championship.

It is uncertain if the winner of the 2026 iteration of this matchup will go on to win the championship like in both previous playoff matchups, but one thing is certain: Saturday’s game is sure to be another classic game between the NFL’s two oldest rivals.",https://newmedia-wi.com/sites/default/files/Unknown_0.png,N,,2026-01-07 10:00:12.212504

The most common are those in which a roster is either drafted like a typical fantasy draft or selected from a player pool where players can be rostered on multiple fantasy teams.

The cheat sheet below list is best used in leagues with PPR scoring, one point per 20 passing yards, four points per passing touchdown and six points per rushing or receiving touchdown.

The Key to Success for Playoffs Fantasy Drafts

It is tempting to target players on the No. 1 seeds from each conference, and sometimes that pays off. However, there are upsets almost every year in the playoffs, and the real edge is often found by identifying players from lower-seeded teams who will play multiple games.

Before ranking players as you would for a season-long draft, it is crucial to project how you think the games will unfold throughout the entire bracket. Once you have completed the bracket, note how many games you expect each player to play.

At that point, a useful cheat sheet can be created.

Advice on ""One-and-Done"" Players

Be careful when projecting players you believe will play only one playoff game.

Elite fantasy players who carried teams through the regular season are attractive, but in the playoffs, unless that player delivers a legendary performance in a loss, you risk passing on a elite player who could play multiple games. However, there is a risk-reward element if the draft cost is reasonable for a player you expect to exit early. And do not forget, teams surprise us every year. That player might end up making a deep playoff run.

My Process for Creating This Playoff Cheat Sheet

As noted, predicting the entire playoff bracket is the most important step. From there, placing players with the most projected games atop each position is straightforward. Adjustments are then made for elite players with ""one-and-done"" projections.

Most will not agree with my playoff projections, but that's OK. If you believe a team will advance farther or be eliminated earlier than I do, adjust those players accordingly.

Full disclosure: I have been saying for weeks that this will be one of the strangest playoff fields we have ever seen. I believed the bracket setup would expose some teams' biggest flaws. I did not intend to pick all lower seeds in the first round, but after breaking down the matchups, that is where I landed.

Injury Report

Quarterback

Jordan Love (concussion) will start the Packers' wild-card game. He was injured Week 16 and missed the following week before suiting up not playing last week when the team rested its starters.

Running Back

Omarion Hampton (questionable, ankle) did not play Week 18, as the Chargers rested their key players.

Ty Johnson (questionable, ankle) is day-to-day, according to Bills coach Sean McDermott.

J.K. Dobbins (injured reserve, foot) has a chance to return if the Broncos make a deep playoff run.

Jawhar Jordan (questionable, ankle) was injured Week 18.

Wide Receiver

Davante Adams (questionable, hamstring) missed the last three games, but early indications are that he will be ready to start.

Ricky Pearsall (questionable, knee) has been in and out of the lineup since Week 5 and did not play Week 18.

Rome Odunze (questionable, foot) missed the last five games but participated in limited practices ahead of Week 18.

Dontayvion Wicks (questionable, concussion) was injured Week 17 and missed the regular-season finale.

Jordan Whittington (questionable, knee) was injured Week 18.

Bo Melton (questionable, knee) left Week 18 with the injury.

KeAndre Lambert-Smith (questionable, hamstring) was injured in the regular-season finale.

Tight End

Dallas Goedert (questionable, knee) sat out Week 18, though the Eagles rested most of their starters.

Terrance Ferguson (questionable, hamstring) was injured Week 18, but Rams coach Sean McVay expects Ferguson to be available this weekend.

Grant Calcaterra (questionable, ankle/knee) left Week 18 with injuries.

Kicker

Matt Prater (questionable, quadriceps) is considered ""more day-to-day,"" according to McDermott.

Quick Hits on Each Playoff Team

Rams: They faded late but should get Davante Adams back. The offense is elite, and the defense is good enough to fuel a playoff run.

Bills: Playing on the road with a leaky defense is not ideal, but this is a year where Josh Allen can drag the team to the finish line.

49ers: Despite disappearing in Week 18, this offense is capable of forcing shootouts, which is ideal for fantasy.

Seahawks: The defense is elite, but until Sam Darnold proves to be more than a strong regular-season performer, it is hard to believe in him.

Packers: The offense could step up, but the loss of Micah Parsons will catch up with the team in January.

Chargers: It would be great to see Justin Herbert make a run, but the offensive line is unlikely to give him the chance.

Broncos: A bye week and home-field advantage with a strong defense give them a chance. However, Bo Nix and his inconsistent mechanics are likely to limit Denver.

Texans: This is a championship-level defense, but a weak running game and poor offensive line could be Houston's downfall.

Patriots: It was a great season, and Drake Maye is an excellent quarterback. That said, the defense is unlikely to do enough, and the offensive line remains a concern in pass protection if New England has to chase points.

Bears: Between a weak defense and an inconsistent passing attack, Chicago appears to be a year or two away from its peak.

Eagles: The offense flashed at times, but it was maddening most weeks. It is tempting to believe Philadelphia can flip a switch, but nothing from the regular season suggests that will happen.

Jaguars: Jacksonville had a phenomenal second half of the season, but drawing Josh Allen in the first round is one of the worst possible matchups.

Steelers: A typical Mike Tomlin season: a winning record followed by an early playoff exit. The defense is not elite, and the offense is unreliable.

Panthers: Carolina lost more games than it won this year. They beat the Rams in a rainstorm, but this time the storm will be unleashed on the Panthers.

Which Other Key Bears are Stuck on Injury Report?","The Chicago Bears received a double dose of good news on the injury front ahead of their first practice for their NFL playoff game against the Green Bay Packers.

According to the team’s official transaction wire, the Bears designated cornerback Kyler Gordon and left tackle Braxton Jones for return from injured reserve, opening their 21-day practice windows and giving them a chance to potentially play against the Packers.

Gordon hasn’t played since Week 13’s win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Black Friday, but his return would boost a Bears defense that has rarely been at full strength in 2025. Gordon’s fill-in in the nickel role, C.J. Gardner-Johnson, is also currently in concussion protocol, giving them all the more reason to hope they can give Gordon the green light.

Meanwhile, Jones is attempting to work his way back to the roster after landing on IR with a knee injury on October 25. While the Bears are unlikely to turn away from rookie Ozzy Trapilo as their starting left tackle in favor of Jones after benching him earlier in the season, his return would give Chicago back its most experienced offensive tackle.

The Bears will kick off against the Packers at Soldier Field in the first round of the 2025 NFL playoffs at 8 p.m. ET on Saturday, January 10, as part of Wild Card Weekend.

Is Kyler Gordon Dependable After Missing Most of 2025?

Gordon’s return to the 53-man roster would be objectively good news for the Bears. He was one of the league’s best and most consistent slot cornerbacks in 2024, regularly generating impact plays for the Bears both in coverage and at the line of scrimmage.

Unfortunately for Chicago, it is hard to imagine they’ll get the best version of Gordon in the playoffs if they activate him from injured reserve before kickoff against the Packers.

The Bears advertised big plans for Gordon in the offseason in the first year of Dennis Allen’s new defensive system, but injuries have limited him to just three games total in 2025. He suffered a hamstring injury in training camp that delayed his 2025 debut until October 13, then played only two games before a groin injury resulted in an IR stint.

Gordon returned to the active roster on Thanksgiving and played the next day against the Eagles, but he reaggravated the groin issue in Week 14 and has been down since.

Now, Gordon has still made an impact in his three games, tallying seven tackles, one sack and a fumble recovery on just 117 total defensive snaps, but the Bears should take their time scrutinizing Gordon’s abilities this week before trotting him out in the slot.

Which Other Key Bears are Stuck on Injury Report?

The Bears will now formally add Gordon and Jones to the injury report and give them the week of practice to potentially ramp up to activation, but they are not the only big names that Chicago will expectedly have on its injury report at the start of the playoffs.

Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze is, perhaps, the most consequential. The former top-10 draft pick has missed the past five games with a stress fracture in his left foot, but the team has intentionally held him out in hopes of having him available for the playoffs.

If all goes according to plan, Odunze should play for the first time since Black Friday when the Bears kick off against the Packers, but he must first make it through the week.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2253876328-e1767729524174.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-07 13:02:18.918103

That included 1,202 rushing yards on 311 carries and 924 receiving yards on 102 catches.
On first and second down in 2023, McCaffrey averaged 5.4 yards per carry, had 1,337 rushing yards and scored 14 rushing touchdowns.
This season, those same numbers were 3.9 yards per carry, 1,064 rushing yards and 7 rushing touchdowns.
They were outgained by 525 rushing yards last season, and their rush differential was plus-501 this season.","The NFL playoff field is set, and you know these teams. For months, you've been watching them, talking about them and drawing conclusions about them. But some of those conclusions are wrong.

It's not your fault. The week-to-week nature of the NFL lends itself quite naturally to missing the forest for the trees. You see a team one week, notice something about it, watch that same team a week or so later and notice the same thing again. And then you just figure that thing to be true -- that it's part of what defines that team.

But what we're doing here -- with the 18-week regular season concluded and four months' worth of data to sort through -- is step back, look at the bigger picture and figure out which of the things we think we know about each playoff team might not, in fact, be true. For some of these teams, our conclusions might be encouraging. For some, they might be cause for concern. But hopefully this offers at least a little bit of a different way to look at all 14 playoff teams as they get ready to prove us all right or wrong (or a little of both).

So here are our annual playoff myth-busters, with a big assist from ESPN researcher Paul ""Hembo"" Hembekides and the ESPN Research team. Let's start with the NFC, and teams are ordered by seeding.

Jump to a team:

BUF | CAR | CHI | DEN | GB

HOU | JAX | LAC | LAR | NE

PHI | PIT | SF | SEA

NFC

1. Seattle Seahawks

Myth: Their run game isn't good enough.

The Seahawks finished the season ranked 27th in the NFL in offensive rush EPA, which backs up the seasonlong narrative that they weren't running the ball consistently well and relied too much on their (admittedly outstanding) defense and wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba. Seattle scored the third-most points of any team in the regular season but finished outside the top 10 in rushing yards per game despite tying for third in rush attempts. Its 4.1 yards per carry was better than only seven teams (although three of those clubs also made the playoffs).

Why it's a myth: They've run the ball a lot better over the second half of the season.

From Weeks 10 through 18, Seattle's running backs ranked fourth in the league in offensive rush EPA, behind only those of the Ravens, Rams and Patriots. Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet combined for 2,183 scrimmage yards. Yes, other teams use two-back rotations that were more productive this season. The Rams' Kyren Williams and Blake Corum combined for 2,315 scrimmage yards. The Steelers' Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell had 2,314. But the point is not that Seattle runs the ball better than anyone, it's that it runs it well enough -- and better as the season has gone along.

Smith-Njigba is a brilliant and vital player, but his highest target-share game of the season came in a September loss to the 49ers. The Seahawks' offense began to ask more of its run game and less of Sam Darnold, Smith-Njigba and the pass game in the second half, and conclusions we were drawing about them in the first half might not hold up in the playoffs.

2. Chicago Bears

Myth: Caleb Williams' inaccuracy hurts the offense.

The Bears had a dominant run game this season. Their defense excelled at taking the ball away. And Williams -- their brilliantly talented second-year quarterback -- made some fourth-quarter magic in big wins. But his completion percentage of 58.1 is abysmal and ranked 32nd in the league among qualified starters. In this day and age, it's tough to imagine a team winning a Super Bowl with a quarterback who isn't completing 60% of his passes.

Why it's a myth: Williams has improved significantly at avoiding negative plays.

Williams led the NFL with 40 throwaways, which obviously affect completion percentages but aren't necessarily a bad thing. Five of the top seven completion percentage games of his season actually came in Bears losses, while they won nine of his 10 worst. He had the league's second-lowest pressure-to-sack ratio (behind Brock Purdy), his pressure-to-interception ratio was third best, and he threw nine touchdowns when pressured (behind only Justin Herbert's 10) to just one interception. Sure, his completion percentage when pressured was 36.4 and surely drags down the overall number. But that doesn't tell the whole story.

New coach Ben Johnson stressed to Williams when he got the job last year that, while avoiding interceptions was something he did well as a rookie, there were other negative plays he had to get better at avoiding if he and the offense wanted to have success. And Williams is doing an excellent job of staying away from interceptions and sacks, especially when he has faced pressure this season. That's a benefit to the offense no matter what the overall completion percentage says.

3. Philadelphia Eagles

Myth: Saquon Barkley is the key to the offense.

This time last season, the Eagles were a juggernaut on their way to a Super Bowl title. The key to the whole thing was Barkley's historic season. He had 2,005 rushing yards, 2,283 total yards from scrimmage and 15 total touchdowns in the 2024 regular season to lead an Eagles offense that was one of the best and most efficient in the league. This season, Barkley's production dipped significantly, down to 1,140 rushing yards, 1,413 scrimmage yards and 9 total touchdowns. An Eagles team that was fourth in offensive efficiency in 2024 ranked 19th in that same category in 2025.

Why it's a myth: It's actually Jalen Hurts.

While last season's offense seemed to center around Barkley and the Eagles' ability to generate explosive plays in the run game, this season's offense seems to much more closely follow the performance of the team's Super Bowl MVP quarterback. Barkley is averaging 91.5 scrimmage yards in Eagles wins this season and 81.4 in losses. He's averaging 3.9 yards per carry in wins and 4.7 in losses. Seven of his touchdowns have come in the Eagles' 11 wins, whereas he has five in losses. In other words, there doesn't seem to be evidence of a dramatic difference in Barkley's performance in wins versus his performance in losses.

Hurts, on the other hand, sees a great deal more variance. In Eagles wins, Hurts has a 64.2 QBR, a 5.1 completion percentage over expected (NFL Next Gen Stats), 19 touchdown passes and zero interceptions. In losses, he has a 38.2 QBR, a 0.1 CPOE, 6 touchdown passes and 6 interceptions. Just a lot of evidence to suggest that Philadelphia's success in 2025 is tied much more closely to Hurts' performance than it is to what Barkley does.

4. Carolina Panthers

Myth: They can't possibly beat the Rams again.

Carolina's Week 13 home upset of the Rams was one of the more surprising results of the entire regular season. The Rams came in as the hottest team in the league, having won six games in a row to get to 9-2. They had beaten the 49ers, Seahawks and Buccaneers in the previous three weeks and seemed poised to take control of the NFC playoff race. But on that rainy Sunday in Charlotte, Matthew Stafford threw two early interceptions and lost a crucial late-game fumble. Bryce Young threw two fourth-down touchdowns (and one third-down TD pass), and the Panthers got out with a 31-28 victory.

It felt a little fluky at the time, and with the Panthers limping to their division title with an 8-9 record, it feels unlikely to happen again in the wild-card round.

Why it's a myth: The Panthers can kind of beat anyone.

Sure, they can also lose to anyone. They were 8-9, after all. But Carolina had eight wins as an underdog this season, by far the most in the NFL. (The Steelers, Bears, Jaguars and Falcons each had five.) The Panthers will be the seventh team with a record of .500 or worse to host a wild-card game. Of the previous six, four won the contest.

The 2008 Chargers beat the Colts. The 2010 Seahawks beat the defending Super Bowl champion Saints in the Marshawn Lynch ""Beast Quake"" game. The Tim Tebow Broncos of 2011 knocked off the Steelers. And the 2014 Panthers beat the Cardinals. The last two teams to host a wild-card game with a regular-season record of .500 or worse did lose -- the 2020 Washington Football Team to the Buccaneers and the 2022 Buccaneers to the Cowboys. But the overall record of 4-2 certainly shows it can be done.

Carolina's big wide receivers were a problem for the Rams' cornerbacks in the first matchup and could be again if the Panthers can do a good enough job of keeping the Rams' rush off Young. All I'm saying is it wouldn't be the most stunning potential upset of the first round.

5. Los Angeles Rams

Myth: Matthew Stafford should win MVP because Drake Maye played a soft schedule.

It appears the MVP race is down to Rams veteran Stafford and Patriots second-year star Maye. The knock on Maye has been that he didn't beat anyone especially good. The only teams in the playoff field the Patriots beat this season were the Bills (to whom they also lost) and the Panthers (who finished the season with a losing record).

Stafford led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes, threw eight interceptions and had a Total QBR of 71.0 -- fourth best in the league. Maye had 4,394 passing yards, 31 touchdown passes, 8 interceptions and a league-leading Total QBR of 77.2.

Why it's a myth: Maye has just simply been better.

Total QBR adjusts for opponent quality in its calculation, so the fact that Maye finished first in the league in that category and Stafford fourth has nothing to do with strength of schedule. It also should matter that Maye played better against the soft parts of his schedule than Stafford did against his. Just look at games against NFC South opponents. The Patriots went 4-0 in those matchups, and Maye turned the ball over a total of three times. The Rams went 2-2 against the NFC South, and Stafford turned it over six times, including the fumble that probably cost the Rams the game against Carolina.

Overall, Maye was considerably better than Stafford in common opponent games. They played six of them. Maye was 6-0 with an 81.6 QBR and a 4.3 touchdown-to-interception ratio. Stafford was 4-2 with a 57.8 QBR and a 2.3 touchdown-to-interception ratio against those teams.

The only number that shows Stafford obviously better than Maye this season is the touchdown passes. But don't forget that a somewhat stunning 16 of Stafford's touchdown passes were 4 yards or less (Maye had nine) and eight came from the 1-yard line (Maye had three). Maye also had four rushing touchdowns, while Stafford hasn't had one since 2022.

Give the award to Stafford if you want, but don't do it because of relative strength of schedule. Maye had the better year, even once we adjust for that.

6. San Francisco 49ers

Myth: Christian McCaffrey just had his best season as a 49er.

In a season in which it felt like every significant player on the 49ers missed time with injury, McCaffrey did not. He played in all 17 games and was second in the league in yards from scrimmage with 2,126. That included 1,202 rushing yards on 311 carries and 924 receiving yards on 102 catches. Only five players in the league caught more passes than McCaffrey; four were wide receivers and one was a tight end. The next highest reception total among running backs in 2025 was Bijan Robinson's 79.

McCaffrey also had 17 total touchdowns (10 rushing, seven receiving), which put him third in the league behind Jonathan Taylor and Jahmyr Gibbs. Simply put, CMC was a rock when the Niners needed one. The only year in his career in which he posted more scrimmage yards was his 2019 season in Carolina, and the only two years in which he had more touchdowns were 2019 and his 2023 season in San Francisco.

Why it's a myth: Well, 2023 happened ... but his efficiency also wasn't great this season.

McCaffrey averaged only 3.9 yards per carry this season. That figure ranked 39th in the NFL, right behind Isiah Pacheco and ahead of Chuba Hubbard. And the 49ers' run game was very average, ranking 22nd in rush EPA. McCaffrey's contributions as a receiver are what made his season special and helped win fantasy leagues and drag the banged-up 49ers into the playoffs. But overall, his 2025 season doesn't hold a candle to 2023.

The starkest difference is in early-down efficiency. On first and second down in 2023, McCaffrey averaged 5.4 yards per carry, had 1,337 rushing yards and scored 14 rushing touchdowns. This season, those same numbers were 3.9 yards per carry, 1,064 rushing yards and 7 rushing touchdowns. Workmanlike, for sure, but not spectacular.

Again, McCaffrey was what the 49ers needed him to be this season -- a volume eater and target mismatch in the passing game. But he's not the explosive early-down difference-maker that he was a couple of years ago when the 49ers made it all the way to overtime in the Super Bowl.

7. Green Bay Packers

Myth: They don't have a true No. 1 wide receiver.

Packers coach Matt LaFleur had that famous quote a little over a year ago about how he wants ""to vomit"" when people ask him about his No. 1 wide receiver. LaFleur's point was that it doesn't matter -- that he and QB Jordan Love trust whoever's out there and that he kind of likes having an interchangeable group of WRs that he can mix and match depending on the week and the opponent.

The Packers didn't have a single receiver with more than 55 catches, 724 yards or 6 touchdowns in 2025. Last season, their team leaders in those categories had 55 catches, 857 yards and 7 touchdowns. The year before it was 64, 793 and 8. You get the idea.

Why it's a myth: Christian Watson.

Watson missed the first six games of this season while recovering from a knee injury, which has been his biggest problem as a pro. He returned around the same time that the Packers lost tight end Tucker Kraft to a season-ending injury and helped fill in a lot of the explosive-play element their offense lost when Kraft went down. Love's QBR is 77.7 when Watson is on the field and 69.5 when he's not. His completion percentage over expectation is 5.5% when Watson is on the field and 2.5% when he's not, per Next Gen Stats. His touchdown-to-interception ratio is 5.5 with Watson and 3.0 without. And in the 10 weeks this season in which Watson has played, Love's QBR of 76.7 is the second best in the NFL, behind only Purdy.

The 34th pick in the 2022 draft, Watson has the profile of a No. 1 WR. Injuries have kept him from consistently performing like one, but when he's out there, the effect he has on Love and the offense makes a strong case that he is a WR1.

AFC

1. Denver Broncos

Myth: Their record in close games is going to catch up with them.

The Broncos were 11-2 this season in games decided by eight points or fewer. They are proud of this. They do not view it as luck, and coach Sean Payton has said as much in news conferences. Players on the team have told me when I've covered their games this season that this was a major point of emphasis in their offseason. They were 2-6 in one-score games last season and wanted to be the kind of team that finished close contests off. They believe they're better equipped than their opponents to stay strong in the fourth quarter and make game-deciding plays in game-deciding moments -- especially in home games at Denver's high altitude.

All of that might be true, but decades' worth of data says this is the kind of thing that's prone to regression and won't stay the case if we give it long enough. Just look at the Chiefs, who went 11-0 in one-score games last season (12-0 if you count the playoffs) and were 1-9 in one-score contests in 2025. If it can catch up to Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid, you have to think it could catch up to anyone.

Why it's a myth: It isn't the 2026 season quite yet.

The natural regression to the mean when it comes to a team's record in one-score games doesn't have to happen in the same season. Over the past 10 seasons, 11 of the 20 teams to participate in the Super Bowl have had winning percentages better than .700 in their one-score games in that regular season. I just mentioned the Chiefs, but the Eagles -- the team that beat them in the Super Bowl -- were also 8-2 in one-score regular-season games in 2024. In 2022, when those same two teams met in the Super Bowl, the Chiefs had been 7-3 and the Eagles 7-1 in one-score games that regular season. The last Broncos team to win the Super Bowl, going back 10 years, was 9-3 in one-score games that regular season. The Panthers team they beat in that Super Bowl had gone 7-1 in one-score games.

Payton's point has seemed to be that there's some sort of art to winning close games, and that really good teams are just better at it. There's also a mentality a team can develop over the course of a season that convinces it that it's good at such a thing, and that could help in the critical moments in a league in which the week-to-week margins are so small. Point is, we have a lot of history that tells us teams that are great in one-score games can and do get to the Super Bowl.

2. New England Patriots

Myth: The Patriots' run defense is going to be a liability in the playoffs.

New England's run defense was a big talking point early in the season. Until Tampa Bay's Sean Tucker got 53 yards against the Pats in Week 10, no opposing running back had reached 50 rushing yards in a game. From Weeks 1 through 11, they ranked fifth in the NFL with 2.2 yards allowed before first contact per rush and 14th with a defensive rush success rate of 57.7%.

But from Weeks 12 through 17, the Patriots had one of the worst run defenses in the league. Over that six-week stretch, New England ranked 31st with 3.0 yards before first contact allowed per rush and 32nd with a 45.2% defensive rushing success rate. A team such as Buffalo, which rushed for 118 yards in its Week 5 loss to the Pats and 168 in its Week 15 victory in Foxborough, could be positioned to take advantage of a weakened Pats defense in a postseason matchup.

Why it's a myth: Milton Williams.

The big defensive tackle signed a four-year, $104 million deal with the Patriots in March in free agency. He got injured in the team's Week 11 game against the Jets and didn't return until Sunday's season finale against the Dolphins. That likely explains a lot about why the Patriots struggled so badly against the run from Weeks 12 through 17. New England spent big to sign Williams, who was drawing interest from multiple teams, and the numbers when he's on the field vs. when he's not indicate why that was a good idea -- and why his return bodes extremely well for New England's chances of shoring up that run defense in the playoffs. The Pats also expect to have injured linebacker Robert Spillane back in time for the postseason, which will help even more.

3. Jacksonville Jaguars

Myth: Trevor Lawrence is fixed and one of the best QBs in the league.

Lawrence threw 15 touchdown passes against just one interception in his final six games of the regular season. The Jaguars won their last eight games to secure a division title, and entering Sunday, they were still in position to potentially get the 1-seed in the AFC playoffs (though they did not). The first pick in the 2021 NFL draft, Lawrence appears to finally be living up to his potential under first-year coach Liam Coen and has led the Jaguars to their second 13-win season in team history -- first this century.

Why it's a myth: The stats say Lawrence is pretty much the same guy he has always been.

Lawrence's Total QBR for the season was 58.3, 15th best in the league and just a smidge ahead of where he has always been. From 2022 to 2024, his year-by-year Total QBR numbers were 56.1, 56.9 and 56.1. His completion percentage over expectation (Next Gen Stats) last season was minus-4.0, which ranked 33rd in a 32-team league. This year? It was minus-2.7, which ranked 28th.

Now, this isn't a criticism. Heck, the guy who's 33rd in CPOE is Caleb Williams, and his team is the No. 2 seed in the NFC playoffs. But the idea that Lawrence is playing better than he ever has isn't supported by the underlying numbers. Coen should be given credit for figuring out the whole picture around him and putting him in an offense that minimizes his weaknesses and maximizes his strengths. The Jaguars' rushing differential has seen the greatest year-over-year improvement of any team in the league. They were outgained by 525 rushing yards last season, and their rush differential was plus-501 this season.

Lawrence is the same player he has always been, just with a better structure around him. It's not necessarily that he's fixed; it's that maybe the Jaguars are.

4. Pittsburgh Steelers

Myth: This is still a classic Steelers defense.

T.J. Watt returned from a punctured lung for the regular-season finale against the Ravens. Cameron Heyward played inspired football Sunday night at age 36, looking determined to make sure this wasn't his or Aaron Rodgers' final game. Nick Herbig. Alex Highsmith. Patrick Queen. Jalen Ramsey. The names, man. The names give it the feel of a vintage Steelers, big-play defense that can get after quarterbacks and get the big stops in the big moments.

Only five teams in the league had more sacks than the Steelers' 48. Only three had more takeaways than their 27.

Why it's a myth: This team is way too reliant on sacks and turnovers.

The Steelers ranked 14th in the league in opponent points allowed per drive at 2.1 -- which is fine, kind of middle of the pack. On drives on which they didn't record a sack, however, that average points per drive goes up to 2.5, which ranked 23rd in the league. Their defense basically doesn't win unless it gets a sack.

The team also isn't great at scoring when it doesn't generate a turnover. Pittsburgh scored the 15th-most points in 2025, but it was third in scoring off turnovers behind only the Jaguars and Bears. A whopping 25.4% of Pittsburgh's points this season came off turnovers. Only the Browns (25.8%) had a higher such percentage, and they scored only 279 points (the Steelers had 391).

There is no doubt the Pittsburgh offense needs its defense's help. And the defense provided enough to get this team to 10 wins and a division title when Baltimore's rookie kicker missed from 44 yards Sunday night. But it feels like another season in which the playoff competition is going to make Pittsburgh look very run-of-the-mill.

5. Houston Texans

Myth: C.J. Stroud isn't the same player he was two years ago.

In 2023 when the Texans snagged the division title, Stroud was Offensive Rookie of the Year and finished in the top 10 in MVP voting. He threw for 4,108 yards that season, along with 23 touchdown passes and only five interceptions. But his production dipped in 2024. And this season, he missed three games with a concussion and is averaging about the same number of passing yards (217.2) as he did last season (219.2). He also threw just 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions.

Why it's a myth: He's still great when it matters and still isn't getting much help.

Stroud had the seventh-best QBR in the fourth quarter and the seventh best on third down in the entire league. He also had the seventh-best QBR when outside the pocket, which is of particular importance because the overhauled Houston offensive line still isn't doing much to protect him. That unit ranked 30th in pass block win rate, ahead of only the Lions and Chargers.

The OL also ranked dead last in run block win rate, which backs up the numbers that say the Texans' run game isn't helping anything, either. Houston's 108.9 rushing yards per game ranked 22nd in the league. It ranked 28th in the league at 3.9 yards per rush and 24th in the league in yards before first contact per rush.

The Texans are winning with defense, but when their offense has a good game, it tends to be because of Stroud, not in spite of him.

6. Buffalo Bills

Myth: Their run defense will keep them from getting to the Super Bowl.

Buffalo has struggled to stop the run all season. Only the Commanders, Giants, Jets and Bengals allowed more rushing yards this season than the 136.2 per game the Bills did. No one allowed more rushing touchdowns than the 24 Buffalo allowed, either. And it was 26th in defensive rush success rate and 31st in defensive rush EPA. No matter how you slice it, the Bills' run defense this season was terrible.

Why it's a myth: They might not have to play a great running team in the playoffs.

With Baltimore failing to make it into the field, the Patriots are the only playoff team besides Buffalo that ranked in the top 10 in the NFL in rushing yards per game. (And they had to run for 243 in Sunday's regular-season finale to get there.) The Chargers ranked 12th, the Broncos 16th, the Jaguars 20th, the Texans 22nd and the Steelers 26th.

Buffalo wouldn't be the worst run defense ever to reach the Super Bowl. (The 2006 Colts allowed 173 rushing yards per game in the regular season and were worse across the board in just about every metric.) But it would be one of the worst. The good news is, there isn't a team in the AFC that's nearly as good at running the ball as the Bills are.

7. Los Angeles Chargers

Myth: They ask too much of Justin Herbert to carry their offense.

The story of the Chargers' season has centered on their offensive line injuries. Both starting tackles, Rashawn Slater and Joe Alt, have been out with season-ending injuries for quite some time. Even though he sat out the final game, Herbert was contacted 206 times -- 34 more times than the next most contacted QB in the league (Maye). Only Geno Smith and Cam Ward were sacked more than the 54 times Herbert was dropped. He threw the most touchdowns when pressured (10) of anyone in the league, but only Joe Flacco and Sam Darnold threw more interceptions (7) when pressured than Herbert's six.

Why it's a myth: Their offense isn't that pass-heavy.

The Chargers dropped back to pass on 48.8% of their offensive plays, the 20th-highest rate in the league. Heck, the Steelers had a higher percentage of pass plays than the Chargers. Just 63.6% of their offensive yardage came via the pass, which was also the 20th-highest figure in the league.

The Chargers ranked 12th in the league in rushing yards per game, even with their top two running backs having missed huge chunks of the season with injury. They're just kind of a middle-of-the-road offense overall. Herbert does get hit too much, but it's not because they're putting him in an unusual number of vulnerable situations.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0106%2Fr1597084_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 05:58:59.040261

""It's something that I've been doing my entire career from college to NFL.
Byard's consistency and dependability are rarities in the NFL, yet unsurprising when given the type of players he idolized while growing up.
While Byard always possessed the playmaking abilities of a locker room leader, the two-time Bears captain didn't grow into a vocal leader until 2019.
""I always felt like, to be able to be a great leader, you had to be a great follower first,"" Byard shared.","During his sophomore season in 2017, Byard set a high bar for the remainder of his career, recording a league-best eight interceptions — the most in a season by a Titans player — while also adding two fumble recoveries.

Almost a decade later, Byard's has upheld that reputation. The Philadelphia native has posted at least four interceptions in six of his 10 seasons and, at 32 years old, leads a Bears defense that took the ball away a NFL-leading 33 times. In a league known for its unpredictable nature, Byard believes those stats speak the truth about who he is as a player.

""As consistent as they come,"" Byard affirmed. ""It's something that I've been doing my entire career from college to NFL. [I'm] just super proud about that.

""Anytime you can lead the league in any type of statistical category, especially when you talk about taking the ball away at the safety position, is something that I'm just super proud about.""

Byard's consistency and dependability are rarities in the NFL, yet unsurprising when given the type of players he idolized while growing up. His ""Holy Trinity"" of safeties in the modern era consists of Brian Dawkins, Troy Polamalu and, at the top, Ed Reed.

Both Reed and Polamalu played 12 NFL seasons and appeared in 174 and 158 games, respectively, while Dawkins spent 16 years in the league, totaling 224 games played. The tenacity and intensity with which all three safeties competed, along with their knack for taking the ball away, impressed Byard at a young age and provided a blueprint of the caliber of player he has strived to be.

""Ed Reed is my all-time favorite safety,"" Byard said. ""I mean, his ability to be a ball hawk, the energy level that he brought every single week, I watched his film when I was in college, I still watch his film now. He was a special talent.""

While Byard always possessed the playmaking abilities of a locker room leader, the two-time Bears captain didn't grow into a vocal leader until 2019.

Heading into his fourth season after signing his contract extension in Tennessee, Byard remembers asking veteran defensive tackle Jurrell Casey if he could break down the huddle a few times. The following year, he took over the role alongside DT Jeffrey Simmons.

""I always felt like, to be able to be a great leader, you had to be a great follower first,"" Byard shared. ""I just had great examples early in my career to watch in Tennessee and understand how it is to lead, and sometimes when you're called to be in that position, sometimes you've gotta go take it over. I just take a lot of pride in being able to motivate the guys, inspire the guys, but also do it with my play on the field as well.""

Byard now delivers pregame speeches for the Bears before each game and provides constant support to teammates in-game or throughout the week of preparation, elevating his status as a quintessential team captain.

""He's incredible,"" coach Ben Johnson said Dec. 2. ""I had a lot of respect for him from afar prior to coming into the building and it's nothing but grown from there. He's done a tremendous job taking care of his own business first and foremost.

""He's playing at a really high level on that back end, picking up a new scheme. And he is really leading the charge, not just for the defense, for the entire team. I lean into him heavily for just feeling the pulse for the locker room. He knows what winning looks like, and so his voice really carries a lot of weight for everybody in the building.""

With preparation for the playoffs well underway, Byard's leadership will be necessary inside Halas Hall. Since Sunday, Johnson has been preaching a ""new season"" mentality when it comes to the postseason. Byard — who has been a part of multiple postseason runs, including the Titans' run to the 2019 AFC Championship game — has embodied that mindset.

That started Tuesday just before noon, when Byard brought a Week 1-type of energy to his press conference following a morning session in the weight room. He spoke to the media for nearly 12 minutes, expressing his readiness for the week, his belief in the team and an understanding of what it will take to secure the Bears' first playoff victory since 2011.

""I'm extremely excited, extremely motivated,"" Byard said. ""My energy is up right now. Because at the end of the day, we've obviously had a really good season, division wins, all that other stuff, but everything is zero-zero right now. Even the playoff stats reset.

""We have a great opportunity to go on a run, and it's all about [doing] the best things we can do as far as film study, recovery, everything, and just come in with a great attitude because at the end of the day, we have a special opportunity in front of us and it starts with the Green Bay game.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bears/tkxvojybvfckdby2qwsf,N,,2026-01-07 05:59:02.996770

Indiana football has one less worry when facing Oregon in the Peach Bowl.

Ducks running back Jordon Davison will miss Friday's College Football Playoff semifinal after suffering a broken clavicle, the team confirmed. Aaron J. Fentress of The Oregonian initially reported the news.

Davison has rushed for 667 yards and a team-leading 15 touchdowns this season, including a pair of TDs in Oregon's Orange Bowl win over Texas Tech.

The freshman rushed for 59 yards and had four receptions against Indiana on Oct. 11. He topped 100 yards rushing in wins over Rutgers and Wisconsin.

Remember this IU season with our commemorative book

Complicating matters for Oregon, running back Jayden Limar has entered the transfer portal. He rushed for 262 yards and three touchdowns this season. Limar had a 27-yard reception, Oregon's biggest gain, against Texas Tech.

Noah Whittington leads the Ducks with 129 carries for 829 yards, along with six touchdowns. The junior rushed for 27 yards and had three catches against IU, and he has three 100-yard outings this season.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/01/SDUC/87985354007-usatsi-27915767-168418362-lowres.jpg?crop=3586,2018,x0,y186&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-07 11:02:21.943832

But he quickly stopped feeling sorry for himself knowing what was expected of him from his teammates – and they noticed.
Head coach Sean McVay pointed out how Adams' impact on the offense has extended beyond traditional stats, noting the yardage he's gained just off pass interference penalties drawn alone.
""I had high expectations for him, but I think what I've been so impressed with is how automatic (he is), his game day demeanor and just his everyday approach,"" McVay said.
This trip to the playoffs marks four years since Adams' last postseason appearance in his career.","WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. – Rams head coach Sean McVay is well aware of how much of a competitor Davante Adams is, so he's keenly aware of how the veteran wide receiver took the team's cautious approach to his hamstring injury that he re-aggravated in Week 14.

As much as it may have tested Adams' patience, the approach has him slated to return to action Saturday against the Panthers in the Wild Card round of the playoffs.

""I know it's pissed him off pretty good because of the competitor that he is,"" said McVay, who also told reporters last week that if Week 18 would've been a playoff game, Adams could've played. ""But he's got that look in his eye that I know he's ready to go.""

""It feels great (to be back),"" Adams said. ""I mean, it feels like it's been a year since I've been out there. It's only been less than a month now, but it's exciting. Excited to be back, for sure.""

Even 12 years into playing in the NFL, the veteran receiver said managing the first few days of being injured is something he's still learning. But he quickly stopped feeling sorry for himself knowing what was expected of him from his teammates – and they noticed.

""I was just talking about this with 'Q' (safety Quentin Lake) the other day,"" Adams said Tuesday when asked about the mental challenge of the last couple of weeks. ""How to manage the first few days is always like, feeling sorry for yourself. And then you realize, especially me being in a position I'm in, guys are looking at me for leadership and direction still in the midst of me dealing with and battling injuries. So, still gotta be there for them, being strong for the team, being present and just finding a way to still include myself into things and be helpful.""

""When he's been off the grass for us as of late with the injury, just watching him handle all of that as a human being but also as a teammate and how he has affected our team in a positive way in all those phases is really cool and unique,"" Stafford said. ""It just goes to show you what kind of person he is and what kind of player he is.""

Now healthy again – Adams was estimated as a full participant Tuesday – Adams can resume being a key piece to a 2025 Rams offense, especially in the red zone. Despite missing the final three weeks of the regular season, he still finished as the league leader in receiving touchdowns with 14.

Head coach Sean McVay pointed out how Adams' impact on the offense has extended beyond traditional stats, noting the yardage he's gained just off pass interference penalties drawn alone.

""I had high expectations for him, but I think what I've been so impressed with is how automatic (he is), his game day demeanor and just his everyday approach,"" McVay said. ""I had high expectations just because the way that I had admired his body of work from afar, but he's even better than I thought. More importantly, he's even better as a person. I've really loved to be able to get to know him.""

This trip to the playoffs marks four years since Adams' last postseason appearance in his career. While it makes him more grateful to be playing meaningful football at this point in the season, he also noted that he played in four NFC championships during his eight seasons with the Packers.

His standard and mindset is not simply just returning to the postseason.

""I was talking about this with a couple of the guys, like, you have to forgive me if we're not cheesing ear-to-ear after the first win,"" Adams said. ""Obviously we've got to go out there and do everything we've got to do to get that win, and we got to play the right type of ball first off in order to be in that position. But we got bigger goals in mind that to just survive the first round of the playoffs, so I think everybody's going to have that mindset of just being locked in the whole time and staying present and in the moment so we can take care of business this week and then get ready for the next week.""

When Adams signed with the Rams this past offseason, he noted that it was a ""great team that made a great push"" in 2024, and that he was ""just here to be another piece to hopefully get (them) over the hump"" after last season ended in the divisional round of the playoffs.

Now in position to do so with his regular season contributions playing a big role, he echoed those same sentiments.

""It's just an overall blessing for me,"" Adams said. ""I'm just a piece in this thing and that's what I mentioned to Sean before I got here and all the receivers when I got here. Just letting them know this is not the Davante show in any way, shape or form. This is just me coming here to hopefully help and push this team over edge and get where we ultimately want to be. Sean bringing me here and allowing me to be myself and go out there and put the ball in the end zone and help us win some games, I'm just excited to be back on the field and able to give us more opportunities to do that.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/rams/szwcpsjyooa7qsdercmr,N,,2026-01-07 05:59:14.280123

The Ravens fired head coach John Harbaugh on Tuesday, just two days after a loss to the rival Pittsburgh Steelers knocked them out of postseason contention. The defeat concluded a campaign that started with Super Bowl expectations but ended out of the playoffs for the first time in Baltimore since the 2021 season.

The Ravens announced Harbaugh's dismissal in a statement from team owner Steve Bisciotti, who wrote:

""Following a comprehensive evaluation of the season and the overall direction of our organization, I decided to make a change at head coach. ... This was an incredibly difficult decision, given the tremendous 18 years we have spent together and the profound respect I have for John as a coach and, more importantly, as a great man of integrity.""

Harbaugh released a statement of his own that the Ravens shared upon his dismissal.

""Well I was hoping for a different kind of message on my last day here, someday, but that day has come today,” Harbaugh wrote. “It comes with disappointment certainly, but more with gratitude and appreciation.""

Harbaugh's job may have come down in part to fateful missed field goal

The Ravens got off to a 1-5 start that was exacerbated by multiple injuries to two-time MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson. They rallied to improve to 6-5 to get back into playoff contention and had a chance to make the postseason Sunday night. But they needed to beat the Steelers to clinch that berth, and they didn't.

The Ravens (8-9) were in a position to win Sunday's game after driving into field-goal range in the final seconds. But Tyler Loop missed a 44-yard attempt as time expired, and the Steelers held on for a 26-24 win that secured the AFC North and ended the Ravens' season.

[Get more Ravens news: Baltimore team feed]

The loss proved to be the final straw for Harbaugh's tenure in a tumultuous last season with the team. At 18 seasons, Harbaugh was the second-longest tenured head coach in the NFL behind Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin.

Per The Athletic's Dianna Russini, Harbaugh refused to consider moving on from offensive coordinator Todd Monken in his discussions with team management, and that became a ""key pressure point"" in his dismissal.

Losses, reported tension tank Super Bowl hopes

With Jackson and All-Pro running back Derrick Henry anchoring the offense of a team that finished 12-5 in 2024, the Ravens were picked by many as preseason favorites to win the Super Bowl. Those hopes in Baltimore were muted even before injuries began to derail Jackson's season.

Advertisement

Baltimore got off to a 1-2 start before Jackson injured his hamstring in a Week 4 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Ravens lost their next two starts with Cooper Rush at quarterback, but surged back into playoff contention in a weak AFC North with a five-game midseason win streak.

But the Ravens couldn't maintain that momentum as injuries hampered Jackson for the rest of the season and reports of discord between Harbaugh and Jackson surfaced. The Ravens closed with a 2-4 streak and missed the playoffs with an 8-9 record.

As the losses and rumblings of in-house tension mounted, so did the pressure on Harbaugh's job.

Harbaugh is a franchise stalwart who has coached the Ravens for more than half of their 30-year existence. He led the Ravens to the playoffs in 12 of his 18 seasons and finished with a losing record just three times.

He coached the Ravens to a Super Bowl championship after the 2012 season, defeating his brother Jim and the San Francisco 49ers in New Orleans. Under Harbaugh, the Ravens were a consistent winner and one of the NFL's standout franchises.

Disappointment in Jackson-Harbaugh era piled up

But disappointment and early exits in the postseason became the predominant theme of the Jackson era in Baltimore. With a two-time MVP at quarterback, the Ravens have failed to advance to the Super Bowl much less win one in Jackson's eight seasons with the team.

They've won the AFC North four times and posted 10-plus wins in six of Jackson's eight seasons. But they've been to the AFC championship game just once and are 3-6 in the postseason in that span.

Jackson is 28 and presumably has several years left in his prime. The Ravens ultimately decided they need new leadership to optimize the remainder of Jackson's tenure after repeatedly failing to meet expectations when the stakes were at their highest.

The Harbaugh era will ultimately be remembered fondly in Baltimore as one predominantly defined by winning. But Monday's decision was about building the future around Jackson.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9AjihHPUeATEAvE7GzXZkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/c05c4580-e5d6-11f0-9ffd-1fdbc152dd07,N,,2026-01-07 05:59:16.886774

He leads active Heisman winners in NFL career passing yards (28.525) and is 65th on the career list.
It was an injury-riddled year for a handful of Heisman winners.","In an NFL season as unpredictable as it was entertaining, four Heisman winners saw their teams advance to the postseason, albeit only three are active.

Caleb Williams led the Chicago Bears to an 11-6 mark and the NFC North Division title en route to the NFC No. 2 seed while DeVonta Smith and the Philadelphia Eagles were also division champs with the same record and claimed the No. 3 seed.

Bryce Young and the Carolina Panthers won the NFC South at 8-9, squeaking in via a tiebreaker over the Baker Mayfield-led Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Atlanta.

In the AFC, Travis Hunter’s Jacksonville Jaguars earned the No. 3 seed, but the most recent Heisman winner has been sidelined since November with a knee injury and will not play in the postseason.

A year ago, Smith became the first Heisman winner to secure a Super Bowl ring since Charles Woodson in 2011 when he helped the Eagles beat Kansas City, 40-22. Now, Smith has a chance to become the first Heisman winner to win two straight Super Bowls and just the third to win two overall (which would equal the feat shared by the Cowboys’ Roger Staubach and the Raiders’ Jim Plunkett).

In addition to the Heisman winners, there are three Heisman runners-up and another five Heisman finalists in this year’s NFL playoff mix. The trio of runners-up include Jacksonville’s Trevor Lawrence (2020), Philadelphia’s Jalen Hurts (2019) and San Francisco’s Christian McCaffrey (2015).

Other finalists playing include Denver’s Box Nix (2023), Houston’s C.J. Stroud (2021-22), San Francisco’s Mac Jones (2020), Pittsburgh’s Jabrill Peppers (2016) and Los Angeles’ Stetson Bennett (2022), who is the Rams’ emergency QB.

A handful of other top 10 Heisman finishers are also in action, but none older than 2004 Heisman ninth-place finisher and Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers.

Two more Heisman winners — Baltimore teammates Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry — came within a play of joining the playoff fray, but the Ravens’ Week 18 game-ending field goal miss ended their season.

Henry finished as the league’s second-leading rusher with 1,595 yards on 307 carries, falling 27 yards short of his third career NFL rushing title. Henry’s 17 carries of 20 or more yards was a league-best while his 16 rushing scores were second-best.

Henry moved into 10th all-time on the NFL’s career rushing chart with 13,018 yards, moving past fellow Heisman winner Tony Dorsett in Week 17. Barry Sanders is the only Heisman winner with more career rushing yards (15,269). Henry is also now fourth on the NFL’s career rushing touchdown list (122) and needs one more to catch fellow Heisman winner Marcus Allen.

Williams, who guided the Bears to their first playoff berth since 2020, finished seventh in the NFL in passing yards (3,942) in his sophomore season while throwing 27 TDs, both career bests. He also rushed for 388 yards and his first three rushing scores.

Mayfield was 10th in passing yards (3,693) and threw 26 TDs. He leads active Heisman winners in NFL career passing yards (28.525) and is 65th on the career list.

Young, in guiding the Panthers back to the postseason for the first time since 2017, posted career highs in passing yards (3,011), completion percentage (63.6) and passing TDs (23).

Smith finished the regular season 17th in receiving yards (1,008) and tied for 21st with 77 receptions, including four for scores. It was his third 1,000-yard season with the Eagles and he now has 5,019 career receiving yards, 385 career receptions and 31 career TD catches.

And he's approaching it just like he would attack through an offensive line.

With a heavy dose of determination.

Eight days after having surgery to repair his torn ACL, the Green Bay Packers' star edge rusher posted on his Instagram account a video that shows he's already on the road to recovery.

And in the caption he included his mindset: ""One week out! Let’s make the crazy look normal.""

Parsons, with a big bandage over his left knee, added in the comments of the video that the NFL reposted on its X account that he's getting ""stronger!""

Indeed.

In the video, Parsons was going through a full rotation on a bike.

It's the latest update from Parsons since he suffered a torn ACL in the Packers' Week 15 loss to the Denver Broncos on Dec. 14. He sustained the noncontact injury while trying to chase down quarterback Bo Nix in the third quarter of the game.

Parsons had surgery 15 days later.

Before the injury, Parsons, acquired by the Packers in a blockbuster trade with the Dallas Cowboys in late August, was on his way to another All-Pro season.

During the season, Parsons became the first player in NFL history to have at least 12 sacks in the first five seasons of a career. He finished with 12.5 sacks and was the team's lone Pro Bowl representative.

All signs point to the team drafting a quarterback this offseason after earning the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.","The playoff field is set, led by the top-ranked Seahawks, who have resided in the top spot here for multiple weeks now. They might enter the tournament as the favorites to win Super Bowl LX -- in the same stadium where they clinched the NFC’s top seed -- but this feels like one of the more wide-open postseasons in years. The Broncos, with their 11-2 mark in one-score games, are the AFC's top dogs.

There's no Patrick Mahomes or Lamar Jackson to frighten opponents. No Lions team to do the same. But also: Every playoff team seems to have a significant weakness that can't be overlooked.

Seattle, New England, Chicago and Jacksonville all missed the playoffs a year ago. Those are four of your top six seeds. The Eagles won it all last year, and at their best, they're capable of repeating -- but they also sat many starters on Sunday, ceding the second seed to the Bears.

This might be a year where a lower seed makes some real noise. Everyone will rightfully nominate the Rams and Bills as natural party crashers, but don't sleep on the Texans, Chargers and 49ers.

Playoff intrigue annually abounds, but there's seemingly more of an ""Anyone can win!"" to this postseason field than any in recent memory.

On a programming note, the Power Rankings will keep rolling along in the postseason, although we'll bid adieu to the 18 non-playoff teams next week. But fear not, we'll see them again soon. The offseason is closer than you think.

The Seahawks faced a 49ers team that had scored 90 points in its previous eight quarters, and Seattle summarily ground San Francisco's offense into a fine powder in a shocking performance. We knew the 'Hawks were good defensively, even in the debate for the NFL’s top unit this season -- but to nearly erase the Niners completely, holding them to 173 yards and three points, was a massive statement to the rest of the league. The Eagles won the Super Bowl last season with a similar profile: a swarming, ballhawking defense backed by a strong run game and a big-play passing outfit. I am willing to look past Jason Myers’ miserable game at Levi’s Stadium because of how good the kicker has been this season, especially in the previous two months. Assuming Seattle’s special teams don’t suddenly become an issue, I think turnovers are the one real Achilles’ heel that worries me. If the Seahawks can control the ball, they can win it all.

The Patriots played to win on Sunday, and they looked playoff-ready in thumping the Dolphins. The game was a little closer at one point than the score might have indicated, but the bottom line is New England took care of business and appears to be humming ahead of its matchup with the Chargers. The returns of Milton Williams and Will Campbell also were big positives, with Williams energizing the defensive front, even with a few early mishaps on that side of the ball. Campbell helped pave a run game that demoralized the Dolphins and will be a big element of the Patriots’ first home playoff game since Tom Brady was QB. Strangely, these Pats have a better record on the road (8-0) than at home (6-3), but they have to feel good about how they’re playing. They’ll need to find a pass rush against Justin Herbert, but Drake Maye can also match him throw for throw in what looks like an excellent matchup.

Jacksonville dawdled around on the first series of the game ... and then ripped off 41 unanswered points in a shellacking of Tennessee. The score and opponent aren’t that important, but the Jaguars' quick-strike ability is notable. They’ve had a few games in the second half of the season where they’ve just cranked up the afterburners -- including in the second halves against the Chargers and Broncos. During the eight-game win streak, the Jags have outscored its opponents by a count of 269 to 116. Possibly only getting one home game hurts a bit, but they were 7-2 at home and 6-2 on the road against a very competitive schedule. Getting past Buffalo on Wild Card Weekend will be no cakewalk, either. But the Jaguars have won some impressive games this season, have big-play potential in all three phases and are as poised to make a postseason run as they’ve been since 2017.

Some might view it as controversial, with the Broncos earning the AFC’s top seed, to keep them here. They’ve only lost once since September and will have home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Yet, the loss to the Jaguars and a few close wins have me a bit concerned. Even Broncos fans seemed to sense it when they were mildly booing Denver's offense on Sunday with the team less than a quarter away from clinching said top seed. The Broncos have not been a dominant team this season; they’ve been consistently very good, while also being guilty of leaving the back door open at times. There’s absolutely a path for Bo Nix and the defense to play well enough to get to Santa Clara, especially in this year’s field. But there’s also a scenario where Denver doesn't score enough points and doesn't get that key turnover defensively in a disappointing playoff loss. Which way will it end up?

It was a bittersweet end to the final regular season in Highmark Stadium. The Bills blew out the rival Jets despite sitting several key players, but they also know the chance of squeezing another home game into this season is extremely slim. Josh Allen rested his right foot after the first play of the game, giving him another week to heal and prepare for a tough Jacksonville team. That was the biggest development. But don’t overlook the Bills’ newest kicking drama, with Matt Prater leaving Sunday’s contest. Michael Badgley flamed out of his two-game tryout, and Prater’s status remains in question. The Bills have enough issues as it is; they don’t need another layer of uncertainty. If Allen is healthy, he’s good enough to cover up a lot of warts. But if that foot is still bothering him and Buffalo can’t find a way to play well in all three phases against a good opponent, it could be a one-and-done postseason.

Perhaps it’s a sign of growth, but after playing their last eight Wild Card Round games in the Saturday 4:30 p.m. ET slot, the Texans will head to Pittsburgh for a prime-time contest in which they are favored to win. They’ve won nine straight games, seven of them by one score, but they’re undoubtedly a steadier operation than the Steelers right now and clearly have a good opportunity in front of them. Defense travels, and even after their season-worst 30 points allowed to the Colts and their first-time starting QB, the Texans head into the playoffs with the second-best scoring D in the NFL. Houston's potential lies in how much C.J. Stroud and the offense produce. They’ve been good at taking care of the ball and posting respectable results most weeks, but the output must be kicked up a notch or two in order for the Texans to do some real damage in the playoffs.

Los Angeles locked up the fifth seed and a rematch against Carolina, which beat L.A. in Week 13. Back then, the Rams were presumably the best team in football, and the way they had finished the two prior seasons, it wasn’t hard to imagine them winning it all. Now? The road feels tougher, although not nearly impossible. Matthew Stafford capped an MVP-caliber campaign, roasting the Cardinals to finish the regular season on a high note after two straight losses, but now he and the Rams must return to the field where Stafford turned the ball over three times in that critical loss. They’re still big favorites over the Panthers and will have a chance to re-stoke the fires, but a grueling second-round playoff road game would await them. If Davante Adams is back and their defense can make stands, the Rams will have a chance to make a run. If not, it could be a surprisingly short postseason.

As is fitting for this year’s playoff field, a Week 18 defeat didn’t hurt the Bears. Losing to the Lions made for some nervous moments, but the Eagles’ loss ensured Chicago would end up as the second seed and get a third game against the rival Packers -- a team that nearly swept the Bears. It’s a fun and worthy playoff opener, to see if the Bears really have exorcized the demons that have plagued this franchise for decades. Between allowing explosive plays on defense and the offense stalling for long stretches, there are multiple worries at hand for Chicago on the eve of the playoffs. Only the Bengals, Commanders and Cowboys allowed more yards than the Bears this season, which is an atypical weakness for a team so high in the conference rankings. They’ve thrived by forcing turnovers and cashing in on late offensive drives. That’s an exciting but dangerous way to go. Have Caleb Williams and Ben Johnson bottled up enough late-game magic for January?

The 49ers came crashing down with a stunning short-circuiting offensively, even as good as Seattle’s defense is. The Niners’ explosive ability had been on full display in the previous three games, but the Seahawks just shut them down. The irony is that San Francisco's defense held Seattle to 13 points, although there were enough missed tackles and Seahawks self-inflicted wounds not to praise that effort too much. The bottom line is the 49ers cannot afford anything close to what happened to them offensively in that game. The offense is their bread and butter for making a surprise postseason run, and the voyage starts against a tough, pretty rested Eagles defense in Philadelphia. The Niners have faced some of the NFL’s best defenses -- Seattle, Cleveland, Houston, Jacksonville and the L.A. Rams -- with mixed results. They’re capable of making noise with Brock Purdy, Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle playing in peak form, but Week 18 cast some doubt on just how dangerous they truly are for the long haul.

The Eagles opted to punt on Week 18 to rest up for the playoffs, missing a chance to move up from the No. 3 seed to No. 2. That indifference could be viewed a number of ways, but it did give the Philly offense a chance to breathe a bit before the action gets thick. The defense should be championship-worthy, having shown it can dismantle quality opponents (SEE: wins over the Packers, Lions and Bills). It’ll be strength on strength against a Niners offense that can fill it up quickly, but San Francisco's Week 18 loss to Seattle is proof that the Eagles can prevail with elite defense. But can they score? Can they generate explosive plays and a consistently good run game? That might be the difference between playing one game and making a run at defending their title.

The Chargers seemed to be fine with the idea of going to Foxborough prior to Week 18, sitting Justin Herbert to give him a 14-day rest period as a runway to the game. Given the beating he's taken this season, that might have been the most prudent route. Rest for the likes of Khalil Mack, Derwin James and some offensive linemen probably helped, too. Los Angeles is good enough to beat New England if Herbert has time to operate, but outside of a dominant performance at Dallas, the Bolts haven’t played great on the road down the stretch. Without a complete offensive line, it's hard to imagine this team making a Super Bowl run. But with a capable defense and a miracle-working QB, winning a game or two wouldn’t be stunning.

The Steelers punched the last playoff ticket by surviving Sunday night’s regular-season finale against the rival Ravens, with a fourth quarter few will forget anytime soon. Pittsburgh has won four of five games heading into Monday’s wild-card matchup with Houston, although it would be wrong to call this team “hot” entering the playoffs. Sunday’s arduous win, along with the prior-week loss to the Browns, provided more than enough healthy skepticism about the Steelers’ postseason chances -- starting with this first game, in which they’re home underdogs. The return of DK Metcalf is a potential game-changer, as he was sorely missed during the two-game suspension. But we’re still on Aaron Rodgers watch, as his future continues to hang in the air while this team clings to postseason life. Moving the ball consistently against a wicked Texans defense is going to be a major challenge.

The Packers can take solace in the fact that they beat the Bears once, should have beaten them a second time in Chicago and now have a chance to make up for that missed opportunity. Losing four straight entering the playoffs doesn’t feel like the best run-up possible, but Green Bay should have something of a clean slate facing a team it clearly matches up well against. I’m assuming that Jordan Love will be starting after sitting the two games since he suffered a concussion at Chicago in Week 16. If he and his receivers can connect on a few vertical shots, Green Bay will have a chance to finish what it started a few weeks ago at Soldier Field. Not having Micah Parsons or Tucker Kraft likely means the Packers won’t win a Super Bowl this season, but a postseason victory over their rivals is right there for the taking.

That the Panthers won the division a day after losing to the Bucs, needing a tiebreaker in Atlanta to come through, is a fitting metaphor for the NFC South champs. This is a team with the third-best point differential in the division (minus-69, not so nice) and one that hasn’t won a game by more than seven points since September. Then again, these Panthers also played one of their best games at Bank of America Stadium against the Rams not that long ago and have a shot to beat them at home once again this Saturday. Los Angeles is arguably even less potent now than it was back then, although Carolina clearly is the underdog in this rematch. The shine should not be taken off of the first playoff game for Dave Canales and Bryce Young, though. The franchise’s investments in them have been rewarded to a degree. But it would be pretty stunning to see a sub-.500 team beat a Rams outfit that, until very recently, was considered the Super Bowl favorite.

Tyler Loop’s last-second kick went awry, and after all the teases and reminders of what the Ravens could be (or could have been), the season ended with a thud. Perhaps it just wasn’t their year, as the preponderance of evidence suggested. The 1-5 start. Lamar Jackson’s injuries. The early-season defensive struggles. Derrick Henry’s fumbles in an otherwise-brilliant campaign. Even Loop’s miss was a confounding surprise, considering how good the rookie had been for nearly the entire season. The ingredients were there for another dangerous playoff outfit, but they never quite came together as expected. What this means in the long term is anyone’s guess now, but it’s fair to say that, even with the occasionally scary potential Baltimore displayed this season, this never consistently looked like a team capable of making a Super Bowl run.

EDITOR'S UPDATE: The Ravens are firing head coach John Harbaugh, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport, Mike Garafolo and Tom Pelissero reported on Tuesday.

J.J. McCarthy started Sunday’s finale and was playing well against a Green Bay team resting most of its key players, but McCarthy left in the third quarter after appearing to aggravate the throwing-hand injury that caused him to miss Week 17’s game. That injury in and of itself is not the story. It will heal over the coming months, just like the other injuries McCarthy has suffered over the past couple years. But the long-term questions about his constitution won’t let up until he gets through a season relatively unscathed -- and how much can Minnesota really trust him as the sole protector of the position? The Vikings won their final five games to finish at 9-8, so there’s evidence to suggest they could be in contention a year from now, even with the questions at QB and the possibility of Brian Flores leaving. How Minnesota approaches the offseason will be fascinating and telling.

The Lions finished the season with the NFC North’s best point differential at plus-68, which was actually better than five NFC playoff teams. You can’t call this a successful season after Detroit missed the playoffs, but you can acknowledge that the team came up a few games short against a challenging schedule and that rebounding next season can’t at all be dismissed. Some tough decisions lie ahead, with multiple offensive linemen likely pondering retirement and a defense that still badly needs more depth and firepower. The Lions also need to regain their offensive mojo after a season in which fourth-down failures often cost them. The guts of a playoff contender were still there in the gut-check, game-winning drive against Chicago, and they could be back in 2026.

The Buccaneers' miserable second half of the season was punctuated with a victory that ended up not meaning enough. Eking out a win over the Panthers at home in Week 18 showed the team still had life, but Atlanta's victory over the Saints made that irrelevant. Tampa Bay made its bed by losing seven of eight games following the Week 9 bye. Prior to that, this looked like a Super Bowl-caliber operation on its best days. The finish was a cold reminder that the Bucs weren't actually that close. Even sneaking into the playoffs likely would have temporarily masked the reality that they were several key contributors short of the mark they wanted to hit. Baker Mayfield reached plenty of high notes this season, but his frustrating close is the backdrop to this reality: His contract is up after the 2026 campaign, and the Bucs must decide if his hell-or-high-water recklessness has long-term sustainability. An important offseason awaits this franchise.

Shane Steichen and Chris Ballard will return next season, and there's a path for pending free agent Daniel Jones to come back and finish what he couldn't during an occasionally brilliant 2025. Credit the Colts for going for it and striking while the iron was hot, sitting at 7-2 this season, but the Sauce Gardner trade temporarily backfired -- and the aftermath will be felt in the 2026 NFL Draft, as the Jets now own the 16th overall pick. That will sting come spring, when the Colts are left to address their needs after falling to make the playoffs for the fifth straight season. Did Riley Leonard show enough in his Week 18 start to make the Colts comfortable with a QB room of Anthony Richardson , Leonard and a recovering Jones? If so, the offseason focus could shift to the offensive line and a defense that must be repaired in order to improve.

Arthur Blank didn't even wait for the clock to strike midnight on Sunday, firing head coach Raheem Morris and GM Terry Fontenot after the Falcons beat the Saints and knocked the Bucs out of the postseason. Atlanta's strong finish, in which the Falcons won four straight and dropped the Rams in a prime-time game, was not enough to save the duo after the 4-9 start to the season. The talent suggests this could be a fascinating opening for both spots, especially in what appears to be a wide-open division. But there are questions about QB Michael Penix Jr. 's progression and whether his skill set matches what the yet-to-be-named new regime's vision will be. The Falcons fixed some things defensively, and they feature some explosive offensive talent (even with Kyle Pitts headed to free agency), possibly setting this up as a playoff contender next year, with the right new coach. Ben Johnson, Mike Vrabel and Liam Coen proved it's possible for new blood to have that effect, but Pete Carroll and Aaron Glenn simultaneously showed that improvement is far from guaranteed.

It clearly felt important to Brian Schottenheimer to go into New Jersey in Week 18 and beat a Giants team that had only defeated the Raiders since early October, and yet Dallas fell flat -- with several starters playing at least half the game. It was a frustrating finish, with the Cowboys losing four of their final five games following the dramatic win over the Chiefs on Thanksgiving, serving as a stark reminder of how much still must be done if they harbor any hopes of making a title run during Dak Prescott 's window. The overhaul has to start on Dallas' defense, which was one of the worst units in football this past season. Trevon Diggs ' release was just the first step. On Tuesday, the 'Boys fired defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus after one season on the job. One of the few bright spots for the unit, Jadeveon Clowney , had a career-high three sacks, a forced fumble and a recovery in Sunday's defeat, but he's set to become a free agent. How deep can Dallas go on a 32-year-old while stricken with cap-space issues? It's just one of many questions on that side of the ball this offseason.

After another season missing the playoffs, the Bengals announced that they're going to run it back for 2026, retaining head coach Zac Taylor and personnel head Duke Tobin, along with the franchise's major offensive pillars. Joe Burrow 's window keeps shrinking with every injury-riddled season that passes. And every encouraging development down the stretch in this lost campaign seemingly came with a stark reminder that Cincinnati remains an incomplete product. Perhaps even more pressing than Trey Hendrickson 's impending free agency is a need to continue overhauling a defense that ranked near the bottom of the NFL in several key categories. The Bengals currently find themselves in the netherworld between contending and rebuilding, and they've got to find a way out of that purgatory before it's too late.

The Saints became far more competitive down the stretch in Kellen Moore's first season, showing tangible growth with the move to QB Tyler Shough and finishing the campaign as a surprisingly effective team on defense. The four-game win streak was snapped by Week 18's loss to Atlanta, one that highlighted some real issues on special teams. The Saints won't compete for the playoffs next season unless they make major fixes to that element of the operation, and there are some aging veterans and long-time fixtures on each side of the ball whose futures remain up in the air. But there's at least a runway into 2026 and a hope that an added offseason of preparation should make the Shough-and-Moore-led offense a feared group next fall.

Andy Reid will be back, as will Patrick Mahomes , once his rehabilitation from knee surgery is completed, giving the Chiefs a second chance at competing. We still don't know Travis Kelce 's plans, and it appears as if there could be assistant coaching changes ahead, so there's only so much we can project for this team's immediate and long-term futures. But sprinkle dirt over the Chiefs' graves at your own risk. It might feel like they've hit rock bottom, at least by the standards established over the past decade, but they'll have an avenue toward re-emerging as contenders. To that end, how they go about doing it and how aggressive they are this offseason could be pretty telling.

The Dolphins hit a few high notes in the second half of 2025, but they face an offseason of change ahead. New GM candidates are being interviewed as you read this, and the future of QB Tua Tagovailoa will be the offseason talking point after he was benched for rookie Quinn Ewers . Tyreek Hill also will come into the crosshairs once again this offseason after the Dolphins delayed a split with him prior to this past season. Until the key front-office role is filled, we won't know much about Miami's plan -- although we do have a sense Mike McDaniel will stick around, based on reporting by the NFL Insiders. The inconsistencies of his past few seasons are too glaring to simply brush aside, but McDaniel still has a respectable record overall at 35-33. One way or another, Miami figures to make extensive changes this offseason.

Following a shocking return to irrelevance in 2025, the immediate future of the Commanders remains murky for now. Their defensive needs alone are almost too numerous to list. On top of that, the Commanders must find ways to protect and insulate Jayden Daniels better. Oh, and they'll have new coordinators on both sides of the ball, as Washington parted ways with OC Kliff Kingsbury and DC Joe Whitt Jr. on Tuesday. It appears on the surface that free agency will be an important route for the rebuilding process, with the Commanders currently ranking fifth in projected cap space, per Over The Cap. On the flip side, their draft-pick till has been thinned via past trades; losing 10 of their past 12 games netted them the No. 7 overall choice, but Washington won't have its second- or fourth-round picks in 2026. A return to the playoffs wouldn't be shocking if the defense improves and Daniels can get through the season healthy, but it shouldn't be assumed, either, given the way this past season went.

The Browns moved on from Kevin Stefanski, who should immediately become one of the more sought-after head-coaching candidates available. Such is life for the Browns, who remain a promising but disappointing team sailing through uncharted waters again, searching for some sort of respite after a 5-12 season. They were competitive at times down the stretch, winning their final two games, but they exited with even more questions about their future at football's two most indispensable roles: head coach and quarterback. Whatever promise Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel might hold as NFL signal-callers will remain subject to the next coach's vision and GM Andrew Berry's whim, and picking as high as they are in the draft (No. 6 overall, with the Jaguars' first-rounder also in their possession) puts them in prime QB country in the draft. Again. Who's ready for another Browns offseason?

GM Joe Schoen will be staying put and leading the search for the Giants’ next head coach in yet another offseason of significant change for the franchise. The team appears to have found its quarterback of the future in Jaxson Dart , though his performance and self-preservation skills still remain subject to scrutiny. The roster also features several high-end players who could help trigger an expedited rebuild next season, but the Giants are not nearly as flush with salary-cap space as they were a year ago. They’re not as well-stocked in the draft-pick department, either, with the Week 17 and 18 victories pushing them down to the No. 5 spot overall. They also lack a third-round pick. There are reasons to be optimistic about a quick turnaround, though, especially in a division that could be more up for grabs next season. But there’s also the cold reality that this team has lost double-digit games for three years running.

Cam Ward 's Week 18 shoulder injury marred a strong finish to his otherwise-frustrating rookie season, one that saw the first-year passer swimming mostly upstream during Tennessee’s 1-11 start. Assuming Ward’s injury doesn’t carry long-term concern, he'll be back -- paired with a new coach -- armed to make gains in 2026. The Titans’ draft class flashed some nice promise, and another fresh crop of talent from GM Mike Borgonzi and his staff could have the franchise running more smoothly in time. Even with some big-money misses in recent offseasons, the Titans are stocked with free-agent dollars and cap space. They should be prepared to partner Ward with better offensive weaponry and support staff, but they also can’t overlook all the shortcomings on defense.

Jonathan Gannon couldn’t survive a shockingly bad 2025 season -- his third (and worst) sub.-500 campaign in as many years. Arizona started out 2-0 but quickly fell off the wagon, dropping 14 of their final 15 games. At first, the losses were close and competitive, but too often down the stretch the team lacked competitiveness and appeared disinterested in fighting hard. As with many teams we’ve run through so far, the offseason to-do list appears pretty significant. After finding a head coach, Arizona must decide how to proceed with Kyler Murray , whose future with the club is cloudy, to say the least. There’s a pretty good battery of talent still here that the next coach will inherit, but the QB question -- especially in such a daunting division -- will hang over the Cardinals’ heads until it’s proven they’ve taken the right path forward.

It might seem hard to remember, but the Jets were fairly competitive for stretches this season. The final month was not one of those stretches, however, with defensive firepower long since traded away, no good solutions at quarterback and injuries further depleting the roster. There’s no other way to say it: Following their Week 13 win over the Falcons, the Jets were just non-competitive down the stretch. We’re not going to crush them for losing to the Bills on Sunday in what was likely the last NFL game at Highmark Stadium (even with Josh Allen playing only one snap), but to crash with that kind of thud is really disappointing. The interception-less streak is an incredible stat, and incredibly damning for a coach who cut his teeth coaching DBs and played the position as a pro. The Jets have major defensive holes, and they have no clear-cut identity on offense before they pick a quarterback and make a long-term decision on RB Breece Hall . Clinching the No. 2 overall selection and having the first-rounder they acquired from the Colts go way up in value after the trade are both nice windfalls, but New York's offseason to-do list is immensely long.

All signs point to the team drafting a quarterback this offseason after earning the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. The Raiders' last-place finish is a reflection of GM John Spytek’s failed Geno Smith trade from the 2025 offseason, but acquiring the veteran always seemed like a transitional move. And speaking of transitions, Vegas will have a new coaching staff in 2026 after the Pete Carroll experiment fell flat. Now all the focus must be on finding a leader who can dispel a losing culture, shepherd a young quarterback and rebuild trust inside and outside of the organization. It could be a monumental offseason for the program, as defensive pillar Maxx Crosby and the team appeared to be on different pages by season’s end, with his future very much hanging in the balance. The Raiders could be a golden rebuilding opportunity, but it’s also a team fraught with issues and major decisions.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/bs8uc5cpqbuhw05g1kvw,N,,2026-01-06 21:14:27.528691

Given his playing situation in Cincinnati, Taylor-Britt said he would be open to playing for a new team next season.","CINCINNATI -- Bengals cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt was sentenced to five days of jail time for a driving incident, an Ohio judge ruled Tuesday.

Taylor-Britt reached a plea deal regarding charges from an incident stemming on Sept. 14. Taylor was facing misdemeanor charges of driving without a license and reckless driving. The ruling was delivered after Hamilton County judge Bernie Bouchard declined to grant Taylor-Britt community service following a court hearing in Cincinnati.

The reckless driving charge is a misdemeanor charge punishable up to 30 days in jail, a $250 fine or a combination of both. After the verdict was delivered, Joseph Tekulve, Taylor-Britt's attorney, attempted to set a fixed date for the Bengals cornerback to serve his jail time.

Bouchard insisted that it be done immediately.

""That's a gift,"" Bouchard told Taylor-Britt on Tuesday. ""Five days instead of 30. He's got to do them now. It'll be over soon enough.""

City officials alleged that Taylor-Britt did a burnout on the wrong side of the road on Sept. 14, less than a half mile from Paycor Stadium following Cincinnati's Week 2 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

While court records indicate the incident occurred on Sept. 14, county attorneys testified in court that the incident in question occurred in June. A request for comment left for the Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney's office was not immediately returned.

The hearing Tuesday morning started initially without Taylor-Britt. Tekulve told Bouchard that the Bengals cornerback was available on standby and while a plea deal was on the verge of being reached, Taylor-Britt had not officially received a valid license.

""This is getting old,"" said Bouchard, who then instructed to Tekulve to have Taylor-Britt arrive at the courthouse before noon Tuesday under the likelihood of serving jail time.

Two hours later, Taylor-Britt entered the courthouse on crutches. He is recovering from a Lisfranc injury on his left foot that required surgery.

During the second half of Tuesday's hearing, Taylor-Britt made his guilty plea official.

""I just want to apologize, first and foremost for my actions that I've put everybody else through,"" Taylor-Britt said. ""Not intentional in [any] way.""

Tekulve said that Taylor-Britt was at a Kentucky transportation office Tuesday to receive his new license. The attorney also told the judge that Taylor-Britt has not driven since October and is selling the vehicle involved in the incident.

""I planned already to knock out those things that got me into this place,"" Taylor-Britt told Bouchard. ""Because it's not me.""

Bouchard was not moved. He took exception to why Taylor-Britt was driving without a license when the incident occurred.

""You're putting yourself and everybody else in danger on the street,"" Bouchard said. ""Why?""

""No reason at all,"" Taylor-Britt said.

Despite the plea and the cornerback's contrition, Bouchard sentenced Taylor-Britt to jail time immediately.

The trial date was initially set for Nov. 20 but then moved to Tuesday, two days after the end of Cincinnati's season. Taylor-Britt has not played since he was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 21 following the injury he suffered in a Week 11 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Taylor-Britt, 26, began the season as one of the team's starting outside cornerbacks. However, he was benched, a healthy scratch for the team's Week 7 game against Pittsburgh before returning to the starting role before the injury.

The 2022 second-round pick is set to be a free agent after the expiration of his rookie deal. Cincinnati currently has Dax Hill and DJ Turner II slotted as its top outside cornerbacks.

Taylor-Britt spoke to reporters Monday, before his criminal case was publicized by media reports. Given his playing situation in Cincinnati, Taylor-Britt said he would be open to playing for a new team next season.

""I'm not opposed to it,"" Taylor-Britt said. ""At the end of the day, I don't think anybody would be mad at a new change of scenery.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0508%2Fr1489876_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 21:14:31.304416

To become a true legend, though, the running back knows more wins need to be part of the story.

""Everywhere I've been I've kind of been the rah-rah just because I'm loud and obnoxious,"" said Skattebo, reflecting on a reporter's question about becoming a phenomenon. ""But we still went 4-13. So, if you're the face of the franchise and you're not a good franchise, then there's still an issue and it's not that big of a deal (to be a fan favorite). But if I'm the face of the franchise when we're winning the Super Bowl, then you can ask me that question in a year or two.""

It was a wise response by a member of the young core looking to reverse the team's fortunes. Skattebo, along with close friend and quarterback Jaxson Dart, will take on even bigger roles now that the ""rookie"" label has been officially shed.

""It's hard to lead a team full of vets,"" Skattebo said. ""Vets look at rookies as rookies, so you have to kind of fight through that if you are a true leader and you fight through that for your rookie year. Things start to change when you're a leader and start to be able to step up and take the role they're supposed to.""

First, Skattebo needs to get healthy.

The fourth-round pick was on his way to a memorable debut campaign with seven total touchdowns in eight games, including a three-score performance during a Thursday night victory over the Eagles at MetLife Stadium.

Skattebo and the Giants were on top of the football world, but two games later, everyone witnessed his dislocated ankle in Philadelphia. Skattebo had to be taken to a local hospital for further evaluation and ultimately surgery.

Ten weeks later, Skattebo said he is on schedule and will soon start ""upping"" his speed. The main thing is getting back the upward movement of his foot, known as dorsiflexion, after being ""stuck"" in a boot for eight weeks.

Training camp is his ultimate goal for a return date, if not earlier for spring practices.

""I've kind of found different ways to show myself and be who I am (in that time), Skattebo said. ""The opportunities that have come from that have been awesome. Obviously, the main thing is football, so I'll get back to that when I'm ready to go. It's football from there on out.""

There is no doubt that he will be back to 100 percent.

""That's not even a question,"" Skattebo said. ""I'm going to be back. I've played seven games in the NFL and I got hurt. There's a long road ahead. That is not going to stop me.""

Then he can start helping his team on the field again as opposed to providing just moral support.

""It sucked because you can't be out there to help,"" Skattebo said. ""When you can't do something to make sure that your team is in a better position to win or you can't contribute at all other than having the energy on the sidelines and making sure the guys in the building have a positive mindset, it's hard to be in that situation. But I tried to take it as best as I could.""

The rookies will also move ahead with a new head coach. A common question in the final locker room session of the season was what are players looking for in the next man to lead the team.

Skattebo turned the question inward.

""No matter who the coach is, the players have got to step it up,"" he said. ""We have to lead an example for each other. Even (interim head coach Mike Kafka) just touched on it. We have to step up to each other and show that we care and have those hard conversations with each other.""

Skattebo added: ""This place is special. They're doing a good job drafting and I'm excited about this upcoming draft and seeing who stays around. I'm excited to build something here. No matter who is in this building, we have our quarterback, so I'm excited for that simply. We build the pieces around him to be successful, and I'm juiced to see what this franchise can be within the next five years.""

Speaking to the media after the Raiders concluded the regular season at 3-14, general manager John Spytek was asked if star defensive end Maxx Crosby is seen as “untradeable” or “untouchable” following a tumultuous finish to the year, when he walked out of the facility after being shut down for the final two games of the season amid a mid-season knee injury.

“I have a lot of respect for Maxx and how much he loves to play the game. I’ve had the opportunity in the last several weeks to spend a lot of time with Maxx and I think it’s been well documented that he didn’t love the idea of not playing football. You always want that from your best players and I think that’s why they’re your best players,” Spytek said, according to Sports Illustrated.

The Raiders exec added Crosby “embodies what a Raider is,” a sentiment he “continue[s] to believe.”

A fourth-round pick out of Eastern Michigan in 2019, Crosby has been a constant for the Raiders, even amid personnel upheaval, particularly the revolving door at head coach.

However, two days before the Raiders fired Carroll after one disappointing season at the helm, The Athletic reported “many believe Las Vegas will be open to moving its star pass rusher” if relations remain icy.

Despite the messy fallout from Crosby’s walkout, the 28-year-old was at Allegiant Stadium Sunday for the team’s final game of the year, a 14-12 victory over the Chiefs.

With the team now searching for its fourth head coach since 2022 — an initiative that will be guided by Spytek and minority owner Tom Brady — perhaps Las Vegas’ new leader will have input about Crosby’s future, whether that’s in Las Vegas or elsewhere.

We're diving into the top rookies by PFF overall grade through the 2025 NFL regular season. To qualify, players needed to have logged at least 100 snaps.

1. TE Jackson Hawes, Buffalo Bills (85.2)

Hawes closed out the regular season with a 58.0 PFF game grade against the Jets. He was held to zero yards on his lone catch of the day. While he allowed no pressure on limited pass-blocking snaps (two), he generated a 26.7% negatively graded play rate as a run blocker, which led to a 59.0 PFF run-blocking grade.

The Bills were the sixth-best run-blocking team this regular season (75.7), with Hawes thriving in that department. The fifth-round pick played 335 run-blocking snaps at a team-high 70.4% rate. While Hawes struggled in gap-blocking schemes (55.8 PFF run-blocking grade), he earned the third-best PFF zone run-blocking grade (83.5) and ranked third at the position in overall PFF run-blocking grade (74.0).

Hawes' positively graded play rate as a run-blocker (14.6%) ranked seventh among rookie tight ends, while his negatively graded play rate (15.5%) ranked fourth best.

The 25-year-old recorded the sixth-best PFF pass-blocking grade at the position (78.7), surrendering zero pressure across 43 snaps this season. He was beaten only twice on those plays.

The Georgia Tech product also proved to be a reliable receiving option, albeit on a small sample size, as he brought in 16 of his 19 targets for 187 yards and three touchdowns. Hawes gained 13 first downs, secured two contested catches and forced four missed tackles. He tallied six catches of 15-plus yards. That culminated in a fourth-ranked 84.1 PFF receiving grade (minimum 15 targets).

2. TE Colston Loveland, Chicago Bears (82.5)

Loveland caught 10 of 13 targets for 91 yards in the Bears' Week 18 loss to the Lions. He gained four first downs, including a 27-yard gain midway through the fourth quarter against busted coverage after he was split out in a wide alignment. Loveland was brought down inside Detroit’s 15-yard line on the play, and he finished the drive off a few plays later with a one-yard touchdown catch to bring Chicago within two points. Loveland secured two contested catches and averaged 3.03 yards per route run in the game, earning a 79.2 PFF receiving grade.

Loveland logged 14 snaps in zone run-blocking schemes (64.4 PFF run-blocking grade). His 31.3% positively graded run-play rate in the game paced the rookie class, leading to a 62.0 PFF run-blocking grade. Overall, Loveland finished the week as the league's 10th-highest-graded tight end (80.6).

The 10th overall pick from Michigan became a prominent part of the Bears' passing attack in his first season, ranking in the top 15 at the position in targets (81), catches (58) and receiving yards (713). The 21-year-old gained 35 first downs (10th most) and caught six touchdown passes while recording 13 explosive gains of 15-plus yards. Loveland also secured nine of 18 contested targets on his way to a fourth-ranked 83.3 PFF receiving grade.

While Loveland struggled in pass protection this season (46.0 PFF pass-blocking grade), he was solid as a run blocker, ranking fourth among rookies in PFF run-blocking grade (68.6). Most of his snaps came in zone schemes (169), where he earned a 72.7 mark.

3. RB Cam Skattebo, New York Giants (80.5)

Skattebo did not play after Week 8 due to a season-ending leg injury.

4. WR Luther Burden III, Chicago Bears (79.4)

Burden tallied just three catches for 35 against the Lions, but each was a gain of 10-plus yards to move the chains in the second half. He averaged 9.3 yards after the catch per reception but dropped a critical pass with just over two minutes remaining and the game tied at 16, giving him three in his past four games.

The 22-year-old enters the playoffs with a top-32 PFF receiving grade (79.9, 22nd). He was the sixth-most-targeted rookie receiver this season (60), recording 47 catches for 652 yards. Burden ranked in the top two in the class in yards after the catch (342) and yards after contact (126), as well as sixth at the position in yards after the catch per reception (7.3).

The Missouri product caught two touchdown passes, gained 27 first downs and recorded 16 plays of 15-plus yards (third most). He also led all rookie receivers in forced missed tackles (10). Only Puka Nacua (3.71) and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (3.62) averaged more yards per route run than Burden (3.69) during the regular season.

Burden was used in a variety of ways within the Bears' offense, but he especially stood out on deep and play-action targets. He caught five of six targets 20-plus yards downfield for 193 yards, earning the sixth-best PFF receiving grade on those plays (99.5). Both of his touchdowns this season came from deep targets.

Meanwhile, Burden also recorded the sixth-best play-action PFF receiving grade (91.2), catching 21 of 23 targets for 13 first downs and 10 explosive gains.

5. WR Tetairoa McMillan, Carolina Panthers (78.7)

McMillan had another strong game against the Buccaneers in their clash for the NFC South title, finishing with the 11th-best PFF receiving grade for the week (76.6). He caught four of six passes for 85 yards — all first downs — with two explosive plays in the second half.

McMillan recorded a 19-yard catch across the middle early in the third quarter with Benjamin Morrison in coverage. His biggest catch came with three minutes remaining in the game, as he split Jacob Parrish and Tykee Smith downfield for a 40-yard pickup on fourth-and-8, going down inside the Buccaneers' 10-yard line with the Panthers down by nine. That catch helped set up a touchdown two plays later. McMillan also earned the fifth-best PFF run-blocking grade at the position for the week (79.9).

That 40-yard catch helped McMillan set a new Panthers rookie receiving record (1,014 yards) — a mark previously held by Kelvin Benjamin (1,008) in 2014. The 2025 eighth overall pick caught 70 passes in the regular season, finishing in the top 15 in receiving yards, touchdowns (seven) and first downs (55). McMillan also ranked 10th in plays of 15-plus yards (30).

McMillan, like Luther Burden III, enters the playoffs with a top-32 PFF receiving grade (78.7). He continues to thrive downfield, earning elite 95.0-plus PFF receiving grades at the Intermediate (97.2) and deep (96.3) levels of the field. He has caught 24 passes between 10 and 19 yards for 440 yards (11th most) and has brought in 10 catches 20-plus yards downfield for 277 yards and four touchdowns.

6. RB Omarion Hampton, Los Angeles Chargers (77.4)

Hampton missed Week 18 with an ankle injury. Head coach Jim Harbaugh said the rookie is “doing everything and anything he can to get back as fast as he can,” per beat reporter Alex Insdorf.

7. T Will Campbell, New England Patriots (76.6)

Campbell returned to the field after missing the previous five weeks with a knee injury. The fourth overall pick graded out as the 10th-best offensive tackle of the week, earning a 74.3 PFF overall grade against the Dolphins. Campbell was beaten three times in pass protection and surrendered a hit, earning a 69.4 PFF pass-blocking grade across 23 snaps.

Campbell fared much better in run blocking, tallying a 10th-ranked 74.4 PFF run-blocking grade for the week. He spent most of his time in gap schemes (67.7, 16 snaps), where he posted the fourth-best impact-block rate among starting left tackles (15.0%) as well as the sixth-best defeated rate (5.0%).

The 22-year-old LSU product has been the highest-graded rookie pass protector this season (76.1), surrendering 26 pressures across 449 snaps for a 5.8% pressure rate (10th best). Campbell has struggled a little more in run blocking (67.7 PFF run-blocking grade), with his impact-block rate (10.8%) ranking among the bottom half of starting left tackles. However, his defeated rate (10.8%) ranks seventh best among the group. The 6-foot-6 tackle has been at his best in zone run-blocking schemes, earning a 68.1 mark across 91 snaps.

8. T Armand Membou, New York Jets (76.5)

Membou finished as the 10th-best pass-protecting tackle in Week 18, earning an 82.2 PFF pass-blocking grade against the Bills. He played 24 snaps in pass protection without surrendering any pressure, closing his season with only one pressure allowed across his final three games (102 pass-blocking snaps). Membou struggled more in run blocking, earning a 65.4 PFF run-blocking grade across 22 snaps. He still finished the day with the 12th-best PFF overall grade among tackles (72.4).

The seventh overall pick from Missouri ended his rookie campaign with 70.0-plus PFF grades in pass protection (73.8) and run blocking (72.1). Membou allowed 33 pressures across 610 pass-blocking snaps, generating a rookie-best 5.4% pressure rate. The 21-year-old also ranked in the top two among starting rookie tackles in impact-block rate (12.7%) and defeated rate (13.7%) as a run blocker. He spent most of his time in zone blocking schemes (255 snaps), where he earned an 82.3 PFF run-blocking grade.

9. T Kelvin Banks Jr., New Orleans Saints (76.4)

Banks' rookie season ended on a sour note after he suffered a leg injury in the first half against the Falcons. He played 14 snaps in the game, garnering an 83.6 PFF pass-blocking grade after giving up no pressure on 10 snaps.

The 21-year-old ninth overall pick finished the year with 70.0-plus PFF grades in both blocking phases. As a run blocker, he ranked second among rookie tackles in impact-block rate (11.4%) while performing exceptionally well in zone schemes (81.2), helping him finish the season with a 76.2 PFF run-blocking grade.

10. LB Jihaad Campbell, Philadelphia Eagles (76.2)

Campbell played 56 snaps in the regular-season finale against the Commanders. He recorded two run stops, holding runners to four yards on those plays, but he also missed a tackle en route to a 67.8 PFF run-defense grade.

Campbell was targeted four times in coverage, allowing three catches for 39 yards and two first downs. He was able to force an incompletion, tipping a pass intended for Deebo Samuel in the second quarter, and earned a 65.8 PFF coverage grade for the game.

The first-round pick from Alabama showed plenty of promise, despite a role reduction in the second half of the season. He placed third among rookie linebackers in PFF run-defense grade (69.7) after recording 29 total tackles with 13 run stops while generating the lowest negatively graded play rate among the same group.

Campbell's 12 pressures tied him with the Browns‘ Carson Schwesinger, and he paced the linebacker class in pass-rush win rate (20.0%) and pressure rate (21.8%).

He remained at his best in coverage, where he tied for the sixth-best PFF coverage grade at the position (78.6). He allowed 24 catches on 32 targets for 271 yards (second-lowest yardage total allowed among rookie linebackers with at least 25 targets). He gave up seven first downs and a touchdown but also recorded six stops and two forced incompletions.

Campbell was a strong tackler, recording 81 tackles with 21 stops and posting the best missed tackle rate (7.3%) in the rookie class.

11. EDGE Abdul Carter, New York Giants (74.7)

Carter earned the fifth-best PFF pass-rush grade for the week (86.2), recording five pressures across 25 snaps. Although he missed a tackle in run defense that led to a first down in the second quarter, Carter finished Week 18 with the 15th-best PFF overall grade among edge rushers (82.0).

The third overall pick has already emerged as one of the NFL's best pass rushers, ranking 10th in PFF pass-rush grade this regular season (84.5). He recorded 66 pressures (tied for 11th most) at a rate of 14.0% and ranked in the top 10 in hurries (43) and quarterback hits (18). He also logged five sacks and ranked in the top two among rookie edge defenders in pressure rate and win rate.

12. QB, Tyler Shough, New Orleans Saints (74.6)

Shough had his ups and downs in the Saints' season finale against the Falcons. He hit Ronnie Bell in the corner of the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown with just over a minute remaining in the game to bring his team within three points. But he also threw a pick on a third-down play on the previous drive.

Shough made two big-time throws in the game, with his touchdown accounting for one and the other coming on a perfectly placed downfield pass to Juwan Johnson late in the first quarter for a 28-yard gain. Outside of his interception, Shough made a second turnover-worthy play, also in the first quarter, with CJ Henderson breaking up a pass intended for Kevin Austin Jr.

The rookie completed 23 of 35 passes for 259 yards and a 53.6 PFF passing grade to close out his campaign. He was sacked four times but also had three rushes for 34 yards, including a 29-yard fourth-quarter scramble and a one-yard touchdown run in the second quarter.

The 26-year-old earned the 13th-best PFF passing grade in his 10 weeks as a starter this season (73.1). He ranked eighth in adjusted completion rate (77.0%) and passing yards (2,384). Shough threw for 10 touchdowns and six interceptions while recording the sixth-best turnover-worthy play rate (1.8%). He was the only rookie quarterback this season to tally a PFF passing grade above 70.0.

The second-round pick from Louisville threw outside the numbers often, ranking fourth in passing attempts (153). He completed 63.4% of his outside passes for 1,134 yards (sixth most) and an 82.2 PFF passing grade (ninth best). Eight of his 10 touchdowns this season stemmed from passes outside of the numbers.

13. CB Nohl Williams, Kansas City Chiefs (74.5)

The third-round pick from California made plays all over the place in the Chiefs' loss to the Raiders. He was left alone for a sack on his lone pass-rushing snap of the day, and he added two tackles in run defense across 30 snaps en route to the fourth-best PFF run-defense grade (80.8) of the week.

Williams was particularly sticky in coverage, allowing only two catches on six targets for 17 yards. He also forced two incompletions and recorded a coverage stop, earning him a 76.4 PFF coverage grade. Overall, Williams graded out as the 10th-best cornerback in Week 18 (82.1 PFF overall grade).

Williams was a top-two rookie cornerback in almost every defensive facet this season. He recorded seven tackles with three stops in run defense, earning a 74.7 PFF run-defense grade on those plays. He also recorded three pressures on eight pass-rushing snaps for a 73.9 PFF pass-rushing grade.

Finally, Williams generated a 19.4% forced incompletion rate in coverage, allowing 20 catches on 36 targets for 227 yards. He surrendered a touchdown and eight first downs but also recorded 10 coverage stops across 257 snaps. Williams was at his best in zone coverage, where he led the rookie class with a 73.3 PFF coverage grade.

14. LB Carson Schwesinger, Cleveland Browns (74.4)

The Browns placed Schwesinger on injured reserve ahead of Week 18 due to a quad injury.

15. DI Walter Nolen, Arizona Cardinals (74.1)

Some of the updates from LaFleur on Tuesday:

-- On Tuesday's practice: LaFleur said Packers will have a ""jog through"" practice on Tuesday on advice from the medical staff coming off a Sunday game and a short week.

-- On where the team is at medically: ""I think we're in pretty good health right now.""

-- On Malik Willis: LaFleur said he ""anticipates"" Willis will be available to be the backup behind Jordan Love on Saturday. Willis did not play last week due to right shoulder and hamstring injuries.

-- On Dontayvion Wicks, who missed last week with a concussion: LaFleur said Wicks has not cleared concussion protocol but will be available to practice Tuesday.

-- On Josh Jacobs: LaFleur did not provide a specific update but said Jacobs ""seems like he is in great spirits."" Jacobs has been dealing with a lingering knee contusion.

On Tuesday, the Bears officially opened the 21-day practice windows for offensive tackle Braxton Jones and cornerback Kyler Gordon, designating both to return from injured reserve.

The move means that either player could be activated ahead of Saturday’s game, though the team will have both practice during the week to see if they will be healthy enough for a return to action.

Gordon has only appeared in three games so far this season, and was placed on injured reserve for a groin injury earlier this year. He has seven tackles and a sack to his credit this season.

Then, Wilson went about his business, staying silent about the hamstring injury.
Through it all, nothing was said to anyone about the secret hamstring injury until today.
Regardless of Wilson’s claim that the Giants didn’t know, the failure of the Giants to disclose the injury via an update to the Week 2 injury report will undoubtedly attract the league’s attention.
Claiming the Giants didn’t know isn’t nearly enough to put the toothpaste back in the tube.","On Monday, Giants quarterback Russell Wilson said he suffered a previously-undisclosed Grade 2 hamstring tear on the last play of Friday’s practice before a Week 2 overtime loss to the Cowboys.

Wilson later reacted to the suggestion that this development will result in the NFL scrutinizing the Giants for failing to disclose the injury.

“Not the [Giants] fault!” Wilson said on Twitter. “They didn’t know bc I didn’t want to tell anyone bc of the circumstances. I just had to play through it to try and go ball that day! Thought we were going to Win that wild crazy game!”

Wilson had said this to reporters on Monday morning: “I played that [Week 2] game, you know, I tore my hamstring on Friday in practice — the last play of practice. And I had a grade two [tear]. I couldn’t tell anybody. I had to go and play on it just because I knew the circumstance, I had to play on it, no matter what. I actually ended up going to the Dallas Mavericks’ facility, training. And, you know, kept it quiet, just trying to get treatment on it and just knowing that I probably couldn’t run from the goal line to the 10-yard line if I wanted to, but I feel like, you know, I got to play this game.”

Under Wilson’s version, he said nothing to anyone from the team about the hamstring injury that occurred during a practice rep, in the presence of teammates, coaches, and anyone else who was there. And no one noticed that anything was amiss — even though, as anyone who has ever suffered a hamstring injury knows, it’s something that prompts a reaction in the form of immediate limping and/or grabbing at the back of the leg.

Then, Wilson went about his business, staying silent about the hamstring injury. He flew with the team to Dallas (no high knees on the plane), arranging a secret treatment session at the Dallas Mavericks’ training facility while breathing not a word of his condition to anyone with the team.

Once in Dallas, he left the Giants to get treatment on the hamstring from the local NBA franchise, again with no one from team management (or, apparently, anyone else) knowing what was happening.

He returned, prepared for the game, played in it, and kept completely quiet about the situation — to the point that the injury didn’t appear on the team’s Week 3 injury report, either. Or Week 4, when he was benched for Jaxson Dart. (Wilson next appeared on the injury report in Week 5, with an ankle injury that did not impact his practice availability.)

Through it all, nothing was said to anyone about the secret hamstring injury until today.

Regardless of Wilson’s claim that the Giants didn’t know, the failure of the Giants to disclose the injury via an update to the Week 2 injury report will undoubtedly attract the league’s attention. (The NFL declined comment on the situation via email to PFT on Monday.)

The prevalence of gambling makes the injury report more important than ever. While it’s unclear whether a team is responsible for an injury that the player affirmatively and successfully conceals from the organization, Wilson’s comments compels the league to launch an inquiry. The NBA’s latest gambling scandal has underscored the importance of ensuring full compliance with the injury-reporting rules.

Speaking of the NBA, that league could have questions about the Mavericks’ apparent willingness to provide secret treatment to Wilson. If, as Wilson says, he went to the Mavs’ facility to get the injury treated, someone there knew about the injury — and participated in its concealment.

Then there’s the question of why Wilson wouldn’t say anything to the team about the injury. Did he fear that he’d be benched for the Week 2 game, if the Giants believed he was less than 100 percent? (Apparently, he did.)

Regardless, Wilson said enough to activate curiosity from the league. Claiming the Giants didn’t know isn’t nearly enough to put the toothpaste back in the tube. Either the NFL cares about the integrity of its injury rules, or it doesn’t.

If it does, the only option is to start asking the Giants questions about what it knew, when it knew it, and why it didn’t disclose the injury. If it doesn’t, Wilson’s disclosure will be forgotten and never mentioned by the NFL.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5472d27/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5462x3072+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2F6a%2F1df2659246fbab0fc209cdae7f05%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2234923947,N,,2026-01-06 18:00:21.202166

Boston concludes its five-game road trip on Tuesday night against the Seattle Kraken. The Bruins practiced on Monday, and Lindholm wasn’t on the ice. Following practice, head coach Marco Sturm said he’d be out for a little while.

“It is not going to be a day-to-day thing,” Sturm said on Monday. “Hopefully not too long, but he’s definitely going to be out for a little bit. We have to do more testing when we’re back in Boston, so we can go from there.”

Lindholm has been an impact player for the Bruins, as he’s recorded one goal and two assists for three points in the last two games. Overall, this season, he’s skated in 34 games, recording three goals and 11 assists for 14 points.

Although Lindholm will be out of the lineup, Sturm said defenseman Henri Jokiharju, who’s been sidelined with an injury since Nov. 28, is a game-time decision.

Moore has been dealing with an elbow injury sustained in Week 4. He had only one catch for 5 yards in the first four games, but he is considered a locker room leader.

Moore has a chance to get playing time behind Tetairoa McMillan and a now-healthy Coker with 2024 first-round pick Xavier Legette struggling.

Two days after the season ended with the Cowboys finishing last in the league in points per game and 30th in yards per game, Eberflus was relieved of his duties.

""Having known Matt Eberflus for decades now, we have tremendous respect and appreciation for him as a coach and a person. After reviewing and discussing the results of our defensive performance this season, though, it was clear that change is needed,"" Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said in a statement. ""This is the first step in that process, and we will continue that review as it applies to reaching our much higher expectations.""

As a result, the Cowboys will be looking for their fourth defensive coordinator in as many years after Dan Quinn (2023), Mike Zimmer (2024) and Eberflus (2025).

The Cowboys' history with Eberflus -- he was an assistant coach from 2011 to 2017 -- and his track record as a quality defensive coordinator led Brian Schottenheimer to add him as defensive coordinator, but things never clicked.

For the first time in franchise history, the Cowboys allowed more than 30 points per game (30.1), giving up a team-record 511 points. This was the seventh time since Jones became the owner and general manager in 1989 that a Cowboys defense allowed 400 or more points and after each occasion there has been a coordinator change or radical scheme change.

The Cowboys traded All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons the week before the season started and failed to secure a consistent pass rush. The Cowboys finished with 35 sacks, their fewest since 2020 when they had 31, which was the final 16-game regular season.

Opponents scored more than 30 points nine times. The Cowboys allowed either a touchdown or field goal on 91 of 177 drives on the season. They allowed 377 yards per game, which was third worst in the league. The 12 takeaways were the fewest in a season since 2015 (8 interceptions, 3 fumble recoveries).

While there was improvement in the run defense, it still ranked just 23rd.

Eberflus took ownership for the poor season, but also said he would not have done anything different if he could do it over again. Unable to consistently get after the quarterback, the Cowboys' secondary was picked apart. Opposing quarterbacks completed 68.5% of the passes.

Even middling quarterbacks had success against Dallas. Russell Wilson threw for 450 yards and three touchdowns in Week 2 but was benched by the New York Giants after one more start. Justin Fields threw for a season-high 282 yards for the New York Jets with two touchdown passes. He did not have another game with more than one touchdown pass before he was benched late last month. Minnesota's J.J. McCarthy threw for a season-high 250 yards against the Cowboys, averaging 10.4 yards per attempt.

In a Week 16 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, the Cowboys did not sack Justin Herbert despite him entering the game as the most-sacked quarterback in the NFL.

At times during the season, owner and general manager Jerry Jones expressed displeasure with the defense but also did not put all of the blame on Eberflus.

The trade for Pro Bowl defensive tackle Quinnen Williams stabilized the defense during a three-game winning streak, but that did not hold up down the stretch. The Cowboys also traded for Cincinnati linebacker Logan Wilson, but he did not see a snap of action in a Week 17 win against the Washington Commanders.

Former Pro Bowl cornerbacks Trevon Diggs and DaRon Bland barely played at the same time. Bland's season was cut short by a foot injury that required surgery. Diggs questioned Eberflus' scheme, wanting to play more man coverage. He missed six games with a concussion and a knee injury, before he was waived on Dec. 30.

The Cowboys have two first-round picks in the upcoming draft but do not have picks in the second and third rounds because of trades for Williams (Jets) and wide receiver George Pickens (Pittsburgh Steelers).

They are certain to face a defensive makeover with five starters or regulars set to hit free agency.

But it is a makeover, in coordinator and/or scheme, that will be necessary after what happened in 2025.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0918%2Fr1547613_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 19:01:38.937676

Dean, the Eagles’ starting linebacker, has been sidelined the past two games with a hamstring injury. There was optimism he could return for the postseason when the Eagles did not place him on injured reserve, and it now appears they’ll have Dean to start the playoffs.

“I do expect Nakobe to play,” Fangio said.

Dean, 25, has been a key player since he rejoined the starting lineup in Week 8. Dean suffered a devastating knee injury in the opening round of last season’s playoffs and missed the Eagles’ Super Bowl run and the start of the 2025 season. It was unknown how he would fit in this season, coming off the injury and joining a lineup that added first-round pick Jihaad Campbell, but Dean quickly returned to his starting role next to Zack Baun.

Dean has played even better this season, effective against the run and proving to be a dangerous blitzer (four sacks). His return has been a major reason why the Eagles have been one of the NFL’s best defenses during the second half of the season. The Eagles allowed only 15 points per game from Weeks 8 to 15.

The linebackers will be tested Sunday against a 49ers offense that can put strain on the middle of the field with Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle.

“It’s a big game for everybody,” Fangio said. “You play an offense this good and this diverse, all 11 got to be cooking.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/17040504/GettyImages-2247071802-scaled-e1763370337436.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-06 15:00:25.858792

Week 18 of the 2025 NFL season is in the books. That means that the playoffs are just around the corner. Unfortunately, most NFL teams will not make the playoffs and their seasons have already ended. That puts a completely different perspective on the injuries that some players suffered during this past weekend’s games.

Suffering an injury is never good, but it helps when a player has the entire offseason to recover.

In this week’s NFL injury roundup, we will mostly cover players on teams that are still alive in the playoffs. However, we’ll also touch on a couple of important quarterback injuries headed into the offseason.

Let’s explore the most important injuries from Week 18 of the 2025 NFL season.

Titans QB Cam Ward (shoulder)

The Titans ended the 2025 season on a low note. Not only did they get blown out by the Jaguars, but their rookie quarterback left the game early with an injury.

Ward suffered an injury to his right shoulder during the first half. He was quickly removed from the meaningless Week 18 game and did not return.

Interim head coach Mike McCoy said after the game that Ward would receive further testing on Monday to determine the severity of his injury. Fortunately, he avoided the worst-case scenario.

Ward has an AC joint sprain that will not require surgery.

Now Titans fans can rest easy knowing that their franchise quarterback should be completely healthy during the offseason.

Vikings QB J.J. McCarthy (hand)

McCarthy just can’t seem to stay healthy early in his NFL career.

Minnesota’s second-year quarterback left Week 18 early after reaggravating an injury to his throwing hand. He sustained a hairline fracture in Week 16 and did not play in Week 17.

McCarthy took himself out of the game after making an awkward throw.

The young quarterback’s health will be under the microscope during the offseason. Especially considering the pressure that Minnesota will be under to win a playoff game in 2026.

Vikings fans should keep their eyes and ears open for updates on McCarthy’s hand injury.

49ers QB Brock Purdy (shoulder)

Now the rest of these injuries will be for players on playoff teams. Let’s start with Purdy.

San Francisco’s franchise quarterback suffered a stinger on his left shoulder during Saturday’s loss to Seattle. The injury occurred on the final play of the game, which made it initially all the more concerning.

Thankfully, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported on Sunday that Purdy is not expected to miss the team’s wild-card game against the Eagles.

The 49ers are in the fortunate situation of having a backup quarterback (Mac Jones) who has already been battle tested this season. So San Francisco should be okay no matter what.

Rams WR Jordan Whittington (knee)

LA’s second-year receiver went down with a knee injury on Sunday against the Cardinals.

Whittington was initially ruled as questionable to return. However, he was ruled out for the rest of the game shortly after being evaluated.

Rams head coach Sean McVay said on Monday that Whittington will have an MRI to determine the severity of his injury.

If Whittington ends up missing some time, backups Tutu Atwell and Xavier Smith would likely get more snaps.

Meanwhile, linebacker Shaun Dolac also left Sunday’s game with a knee injury. He did not return.

It is currently unclear whether Dolac or Whittington will be able to suit up against the Panthers this weekend.

Bills CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle)

Buffalo’s rookie cornerback left Week 18’s game against New York with an ankle injury.

Hairston did not return, which likely made Bills fans fear the worst ahead of the playoffs. Unfortunately, the team got some bad news on Monday.

The rookie is considered week-to-week with his ankle injury and is unlikely to play against Jacksonville this weekend.

The Bills will likely turn to veteran Tre’Davious White to fill in for Hairston against the Jaguars.

Hairston finished the regular season with 14 solo tackles, five passes defensed, and two interceptions.

Hopefully he can return after a week of rest, assuming the Bills take care of business down in Duval County.

Bethune's ailment not the only linebacker injury. Dee Winters (ankle) and Luke Gifford (quadriceps) will be evaluated throughout the week ahead of the 49ers' wild card game against the Philadelphia Eagles after picking up injuries in the Seattle game, Shanahan said.

The only other linebackers on San Francisco's current active roster are Curtis Robinson and Garret Wallow. Robinson has not played since Week 15; Wallow only joined the team less than a month ago, though he ended up seeing 40 defensive snaps against the Seahawks.

The 49ers also have Eric Kendricks, signed in late November, on the practice squad; the 11th-year veteran got his first start of the year in Week 18 and will likely play a big role again.

""I'm real confident in Eric,"" Shanahan said. ""He's been here long enough, he's gotten in in the last couple of weeks, and I'm glad we got him for this situation.""

Hairston did not return, which likely made Bills fans fear the worst ahead of the playoffs. Unfortunately, the team got some bad news on Monday.

The rookie is considered week-to-week with his ankle injury and is unlikely to play against Jacksonville this weekend.

The Bills will likely turn to veteran Tre'Davious White to fill in for Hairston against the Jaguars.

Hairston finished the regular season with 14 solo tackles, five passes defensed, and two interceptions.

Hopefully he can return after a week of rest, assuming the Bills take care of business down in Duval County.",https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Brock-Purdy-on-Dec.-28-2025.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:02:22.909873

Atlanta Falcons (fired Raheem Morris) Total: 15 QB situation (3): Have we ruled out Michael Penix Jr. as a franchise quarterback?
Franchise stability (6): If we’re going by purely reputation, the Falcons have the best among the teams with head-coaching openings.
That is where there’s a good chance the roster talent isn’t as bad as the other teams on this list.","The Arizona Cardinals need a head coach after firing Jonathan Gannon. During their last coaching search, the rest of the NFL job openings were snapped up before Arizona could land on its hire of Gannon.

Ultimately, this process comes down to selling yourself to a pool of candidates who have a decent bit of leverage. If other teams have more appealing situations, you might miss.

Or you take a risk on pursuing a candidate nobody else is, something that ended up happening with the Gannon hire — because of timing at least.

How enticing is Arizona’s job opening? Quarterback Kyler Murray appears to be on the way out. The roster-building under remaining general manager Monti Ossenfort has been happening for three years with mixed results. What do the other gigs have that Arizona does not?

To do this in an organized way, we’re giving each team’s quarterback situation, franchise stability and roster talent a rating from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best-case scenario. And then we’re ranking the job in terms of desirability based on the totals.

Ranking the NFL’s head-coaching openings by QB situation, stability and roster talent

1. New York Giants (fired Brian Daboll)

Total: 16

QB situation (7 out of 10): Jaxson Dart’s emergence was a breath of fresh air for a franchise struggling to build confidence among its fan base, and he produced with 2,272 yards, 63.7% accuracy and 15 touchdowns to five picks — plus nine rushing scores.

His bro-nection with Arizona State product Cam Skattebo gives the team easy-to-root-for leaders, so long as both remain healthy. Concussion issues cropped up for Dart a handful of times. A new head coach must connect with them.

We are pretty sure Dart is a guy to build around.

Franchise stability (3): General manager Joe Schoen is 22-45-1 with a single playoff appearance since he joined the team. This is probably his last chance to get it right.

Beyond that, the Giants have had a single winning season since 2016. Schoen, at present, is most well-known for giving a reason to let very good running back Saquon Barkley walk, while being filmed for Hard Knocks. Not great awareness.

Roster talent (6): The skill player talent is there, with Skattebo and Malik Nabers giving Dart something to work with on offense. Defensively, a front that includes Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns, Kayvon Thibodeaux and Abdul Carter is the strength of the roster.

New York’s offensive line needs a reboot, and what’s behind the defensive line needs it, too.

The Giants have the No. 5 pick.

T-2. Atlanta Falcons (fired Raheem Morris)

Total: 15

QB situation (3): Have we ruled out Michael Penix Jr. as a franchise quarterback? Probably? I guess? That’s generous, even if you get over his many seasons dating back to college that ended with a serious knee injury. And he’ll miss the start of next season with a knee injury. Kirk Cousins is probably gone. Atlanta doesn’t have a first-round pick, so the options don’t look excellent at the moment.

Franchise stability (6): If we’re going by purely reputation, the Falcons have the best among the teams with head-coaching openings. They’ve just failed to get out of the mediocre zone since the 2017 season and Matt Ryan era. More decent news: A first-year general manager will be replacing Terry Fontenot, so this coach will be tied to whomever that guy is.

Roster talent (6): Eight wins is still eight wins, a sign this team wasn’t lacking in talent to a huge degree. Running back Bijan Robinson is whom the offense will revolve around. But among the questions is tight end Kyle Pitts, who finally appeared to figure it out and led the team with 928 receiving yards. He’s a free agent if they don’t franchise-tag him.

Leading tackler and linebacker Kaden Elliss, plus backup running back Tyler Allgeier, are free agents as well.

This team won four games to end the year, some against very good playoff squads.

T-2. Tennessee Titans (fired Brian Callahan)

Total: 15

QB situation (7): Rookie first overall pick Cam Ward took a beating playing for a team that had no clear No. 1 receiver. He and the Raiders’ Geno Smith tied for the NFL lead with 55 sacks taken, but at least the touchdown-to-pick ratio (15 to seven) wasn’t terrible. Ward’s arm talent gave Titans fans something to look forward to at least, but consecutive three-win seasons speak to the roster talent issues in Tennessee.

Franchise stability (4): It looks a little worse now that former head coach Mike Vrabel, who left in 2023, is doing so well so quickly with the New England Patriots. Maybe that is just about optics and timing, where he saw the end of the Ryan Tannehill era, and quarterback prospects Will Levis and Malik Willis didn’t pan out.

Some more weird optics: Owner Amy Adams Strunk clarified this week that GM Mike Borgonzi will run the 53-man roster and coaching staff, while president of football operations Chad Brinker will do the other stuff. Better late than never to clarify job descriptions, I suppose.

Roster talent (4): There’s no No. 1 receiver but plenty of No. 2 or No. 3 options. The Titans have running back Tony Pollard under contract and a defense bolstered by tackle Jeffery Simmons. Holding the No. 4 pick, Tennessee could use a difference-making wideout, a defensive back or linebacker.

The Titans have the cash to spend big in free agency as well. Shoring up the offensive line will need to be done with that cash.

4. Cleveland Browns (fired Kevin Stefanski)

Total: 14

QB situation (4): Deshaun Watson began practicing on the field toward the end of the year and makes $80.7 million coming off a foot injury. He has played 19 whole games since 2022, and we are unsure if he is worth a quarter of that price tag, even if we skip over the sexual assault allegations that we absolutely cannot skip over.

Rookies Dillon Gabriel (937 yards, seven touchdowns, two picks, 80.8 passer rating) and Shedeur Sanders (1,400 yards, seven touchdowns, 10 picks, 68.1 passer rating) might have burned two 2024 draft picks to answer the backup quarterback question. Sanders did look like he had a leap toward the end of the year, and the Browns at least have options in-house.

Franchise stability (3): Did you read the section above? The only good news here is that the Browns live in a division of mediocrity, with the Steelers and Ravens underachieving until the end and the Cincinnati Bengals getting six wins despite the past offseason financial efforts to keep their quarterback-receiver talent intact.

Roster talent (6): Myles Garrett is still awesome! There are some talented pieces elsewhere, with rookie linebacker Carson Schwesinger piling up 156 tackles in a season.

Offensively, running back Quinshon Judkins had a strong rookie year — it also came with a domestic assault allegation that led to no charges — as did tight end Harold Fannin Jr. But nearly the entire starting offensive line is entering free agency, and the receiver group need major upgrading.

Defensive tackle Mason Graham, last year’s No. 5 pick, had some meh basic numbers but still projects to be a talented interior force.

Cleveland owns the No. 6 pick and a late-first via the Jaguars.

5. Arizona Cardinals (fired Jonathan Gannon)

Total: 13

QB situation (4): Give this a bump if you feel somewhere in your heart that Kyler Murray could return and a new coach could optimize him. That seems out of touch with reality, where a bridge has probably been burnt and at this point in his career, he is what he is.

Owning the No. 3 pick gives the Cardinals a shot to draft a quarterback if one of the Raiders or Jets gets the ick and, best-case, only one quarterback is off the board. That seems unlikely. Reality appears that Arizona would be taking the third quarterback off the board in a draft where even the top two options are shrug-worthy.

Jacoby Brissett is under contract and could be a bridge quarterback, whether or not Arizona drafts the future option.

Franchise stability (4): Ossenfort’s press conference explaining the firing of Gannon became a test to see if he could defend his drafting and roster-building duties that were, of course, undercut by the injury bug. He enters his fourth year with a roster that hasn’t seen drastic talent improvement in three years on the job.

Roster talent (5): In Ossenfort’s defense, the injury-hit youngsters could get healthy and back on track. That is where there’s a good chance the roster talent isn’t as bad as the other teams on this list. There are plenty of in-house options who will have an opportunity to take starting jobs at positions like cornerback, linebacker and along the defensive line.

Trey Benson at running back, wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. has shown enough flashes if you put his draft position aside and Michael Wilson shocked the league with a huge Year 3 leap. Josh Sweat made the big spending worth it at edge.

Draft to bulk up the offensive line, attack the WR market in free agency to be sure about the depth in that group and you can sell us on a competitive team returning.

But a coach taking this gig must understand he’s potentially living without a franchise quarterback for a year.

6. Las Vegas Raiders (fired Pete Carroll)

Total: 11

QB situation (5*): Big asterisk here. The QB situation could swing a couple different ways. Starting quarterback Geno Smith is under contract, and the numbers weren’t dreadful. But Las Vegas has the No. 1 pick, and you’d think that is used on a quarterback so long as the evaluators led by (certainly not minority owner Tom Brady) general manager John Spytek like the options of college QBs Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore.

If not, that is an unfortunate spot to be in.

Franchise stability (3): Aside from Jon Gruden’s 22-31 run from 2018-21, owner Mark Davis and the Raiders have not had a head coach last longer than three seasons since — scrolling, scrolling, scrolling — Jon Gruden in 1998-2001.

Roster talent (3): Is Maxx Crosby on this team next year? It would appear that the team ticked him off by shutting him down against his will to secure the No. 1 pick in the draft. Hopefully, that answers our question about whether they like a quarterback in this draft class.

There is some fun talent like tight end Brock Bowers (680 receiving yards, seven touchdowns) and rookie running back Ashton Jeanty (975 rushing yards, 10 total touchdowns). But the foundations in the trenches aren’t there.",https://cdn.arizonasports.com/arizonasports/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cardinals-monti-ossenfort-trade-deadline-e1761766974701.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:02:29.876426

With playoff matchups locked in, it’s important to understand who is hurt and who could be a surprise player behind them.

Let’s dive in.

NFL Wild Card Round Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers

Herbert sat out in Week 18, but this was mostly due to the game having little importance to the season. He’s expected to return to action against the Patriots.

NFL Wild Card Round Injury Report: Running Backs

Omarion Hampton, Los Angeles Chargers

Hampton sat out practice all week and was ultimately ruled out in Week 18. He will need to return to practice to return to the lineup this weekend, but should he return, he does have a tough matchup against a Patriots defense that has allowed the 5th least rushing yards per game amongst playoff teams. If he’s inactive, expect Kimani Vidal to step up in his place.

NFL Wild Card Round Injury Report: Wide Receivers

Rome Odunze, Chicago Bears

Rome was ultimately inactive against the Lions, but he did return to practice last week, and hopefully will return to action against Chicago. We’ll have to wait for more reports to be sure, but his rejoining the lineup should be a spark for the Chicago offense that struggled against Detroit.

Davante Adams, Los Angeles Rams

Adams is expected to return from his hamstring injury against the Panthers. His return to action will be appreciated by Stafford, who targeted Adams on 36 percent of his red zone throws.

Ricky Pearsall, San Francisco 49ers

Pearsall sat out in week 18, but it’s expected that this was mostly precautionary to help him get as healthy as possible for the playoffs. He’s currently expected to return to action, but we will monitor reports throughout the week.

NFL Wild Card Round Injury Report: Tight Ends

Terrance Ferguson, Los Angeles Rams

Ferguson has been dealing with a hamstring injury that caused him to be inactive this past week. Even if he returns to action, Tyler Higbee’s return plus Colby Parkinson make him a rotational piece at best at the current.

New England will host the Chargers at Gillette Stadium on Sunday, Jan. 11 at 8 p.m.","The New England Patriots’ 2025 regular season was a major success, and they managed to end it in style as well. Taking on the Miami Dolphins at Gillette Stadium, the team of head coach Mike Vrabel celebrated a 38-10 victory to secure the second seed in the AFC and set up a wild card playoff game against the Los Angeles Chargers next weekend.

That was not the only positive coming out of the contest, though. The Patriots also appear to have avoided any major injuries, and are therefore trending in the right direction with their first postseason game in four years coming up.

With that said, let’s assess the damage after rewatching the win over Miami.

ED K’Lavon Chaisson: With 12:46 left in the third quarter, the Patriots’ starting outside linebacker remained on the ground after a 9-yard run play. He was tended to by trainers on the field and slow to get up, but eventually walked off under his own power and into the blue medical tent. After a brief stay in the tent, he emerged and joined his teammates on the sidelines. Chaisson returned to the field on the next defensive series, having missed a total of two snaps. No injury status was announced by the team.

The Patriots had to deal with some injury woes recently, and were down four starter-level contributors against the Dolphins. Left guard Jared Wilson missed the game in concussion protocol; defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga is nursing a foot injury; edge defender Harold Landry is dealing with a knee issue; Robert Spillane has been out since early December because of an ankle injury.

The fact that the team emerged from its regular season finale relatively unscathed is therefore a definitive positive with the playoffs on the horizon. That said, Mike Vrabel did not provide much insight when talking about his team’s injury situation on Monday.

“It’s probably too early to tell,” he said. “Alex Austin will continue to practice and his return to play, we’ll evaluate that. And then see where the other guys are — see where Spillane, Landry, Tonga and Jared are as well.”

The Patriots will be back on the practice fields on Wednesday, starting the on-field preparation for their upcoming wild card game against the Chargers. This will give us a clearer outlook when it comes to their injury situation, including K’Lavon Chaisson and that quartet of absentees.

Mercogliano,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6944361/2026/01/06/rangers-shesterkin-injury-drury-trade-deadline-mammoth/,"Star goalie Igor Shesterkin was left writhing in pain after attempting to stop oncoming Utah Mammoth forward JJ Peterka.
Rangers coach Mike Sullivan was predictably vague following the 3-2 overtime loss, noting that Shesterkin was still undergoing tests.
“There are certain guys that drive your team,” Sullivan said.
He’s positioned to speak truth to Dolan about the hard changes needed to set the Rangers up for future success.
An extended Shesterkin absence may force the Rangers to accept that reality sooner than later.","NEW YORK — Roughly two hours after New York Rangers owner James Dolan went on local radio airwaves Monday and urged listeners, “Don’t give up on my team this year,” his club was dealt a potentially crippling blow.

Dolan made his way from WFAN’s Hudson Square studios up to Madison Square Garden, where he bore witness to a hold-your-breath injury involving arguably his most indispensable player.

Star goalie Igor Shesterkin was left writhing in pain after attempting to stop oncoming Utah Mammoth forward JJ Peterka. It initially looked like his right skate got caught and bent awkwardly, but when he was finally helped up by team trainer Andy Hosler and defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov, the 30-year-old wasn’t putting any weight on his left leg.

Rangers coach Mike Sullivan was predictably vague following the 3-2 overtime loss, noting that Shesterkin was still undergoing tests. But any lower-body injury in a non-contact situation is cause for concern.

“There are certain guys that drive your team,” Sullivan said. “He’s one of them for us. He’s an elite player at his position. I think he’s one of the very best in the game. When you lose a player like that for any length of time, those types of players are difficult to replace.”

This came on the heels of another fleeting feel-good moment for the Rangers (20-18-6), who opened the new year by defeating the two-time defending champion Florida Panthers in Friday’s Winter Classic. They hoped that would springboard them into a pivotal month on the NHL calendar — a 14-game stretch leading into February’s Olympic break, which league sources believe could sway team president Chris Drury’s trade deadline strategy.

“With every game that ticks off the calendar, games take on a higher level of importance, because the runway gets shorter,” Sullivan said following Sunday’s practice at the MSG Training Center. “We’re trying to maximize every opportunity we have in front of us.”

Shesterkin’s timeline will be a major influence, but there was already a strong case for the Rangers to consider taking advantage of a seller’s market. Dolan himself preached patience and sounded open to playing the long game, adding, “Culture doesn’t turn around overnight.”

There’s a prevalent narrative among New York fans that Dolan won’t accept anything less than a win-now approach, even if the on-ice evidence suggests these Rangers need to reset in the name of getting younger. But for better or worse, the evidence also points to Dolan keeping the faith in Drury.

He reiterated Monday what I’ve been hearing for months by adamantly affirming his faith in Drury. From what I gathered before the WFAN interview, the bubbling unrest from fans hasn’t put many — if any — chinks in that armor.

As someone recently reminded me, Dolan stood his ground when former team president Glen Sather went four straight seasons without a playoff berth at the beginning of his New York tenure from 2000-04. Public criticism and sporadic “Fire Sather” protests outside of MSG did little to shake that confidence.

Whether Drury has earned that level of security will be an ongoing source of debate, but with his job seemingly safe, the pressure to appease the owner with shortsighted moves should be lifted. He’s positioned to speak truth to Dolan about the hard changes needed to set the Rangers up for future success. (Even if that would, in turn, shine light on his own contributions to their recent downfall.)

A January rally could very well convince both owner and GM to mortgage that future and go for it one more time leading up to the March 6 deadline, but that would only serve as a facade for a team that’s earned just two regulation wins in its last 15 games. An extended Shesterkin absence may force the Rangers to accept that reality sooner than later.

Here are eight more thoughts from the Rangers’ 14th loss in 19 tries at MSG:

1. Jonathan Quick came off the bench 13 minutes into the game and held his own, stopping 14 of the 17 shots in faced. He’s cooled off after a hot start to the season, with an .875 save percentage or worse in four of his last five appearances. But his overall numbers — a .919 SV% and 2.11 goals-against average — remain encouraging.

The Rangers will likely recall 23-year-old Dylan Garand, who’s rebounded from a slow start with his best month of the season for AHL Hartford, but they’ve been reluctant to use him when previous NHL opportunities arose. With Quick’s 40th birthday approaching later this month, we’re about to find out just how much they can lean on the grizzled veteran.

“He’s still an excellent goalie,” Sullivan said. “He’s one of the leaders in that room for good reason. His body of work in this league speaks for itself. If you ask my opinion, I think he’s first-ballot Hall of Famer with what he’s accomplished in the game. But he loves the game and he loves to compete. He’s very capable.”

2. Quick was short while answering postgame questions, with that frustration showing on multiple occasions during the game when he went after Utah players for bumping him or crashing into the net. Asked if he thought the Mammoth crossed the line compared to other teams, Quick left it at this: “It’s a good question. I’ll think on it.”

3. Sullivan didn’t seem as bothered by Utah going to the net as he was by his own team not doing enough of it.

“When you go to the net hard, sometimes there’s incidental contact,” he said. “I think we could go to the net hard. I think it’s an important aspect of scoring goals. You look at the majority of the goals and how they’re scored around the league, and there’s a fair amount of them that are within three feet of the blue paint.”

4. Sullivan also didn’t sound pleased about a third period in which the Rangers let a 2-1 lead slip away and managed only three shots on goal with zero high-danger scoring chances, according to Natural Stat Trick.

“The first half of the period, I didn’t think we played with the level of intensity that we needed to,” he said. “Our challenge is to find a way to bring that consistently. I mean, it’s a game of momentum. Sometimes teams are going to get it. You’re going to get on your heels, but it can’t be for extended periods. We’ve got to do a better job with pushback.”

5. A bright spot for New York was a power play that’s caught fire since Adam Fox rejoined the lineup three games ago. The Rangers scored twice more Monday, starting with Alexis Lafrenière’s tap-in goal on a good net-front feed from Mika Zibanejad at the 8:29 mark of the second period, followed by Vincent Trocheck tipping in an Artemi Panarin wrister a little over eight minutes later.

At that point, the Rangers were a scorching 5-for-6 since Fox’s return, but it was a failure to convert in the third period that stuck with them. Zibanejad hit the post on a tough-angle one-timer, but the full two minutes didn’t feel nearly as threatening.

“They stayed a lot tighter in the last one,” Trocheck said. “It seemed like they were giving us more time to the outside.”

6. Urho Vaakanainen returned to the lineup following eight healthy scratches in the previous nine games and had a rough go at it. He got turned around and beat to the outside on Michael Carcone’s goal, which tied the score at 2-2 with 13:45 left in regulation, and finished with a 38.74 percent expected goals-for rate.

His appearance came at the expense of Matthew Robertson, who had played in the previous 25 straight. The guess here is that Robertson will slot back in when the Buffalo Sabres visit MSG on Thursday.

“Sometimes it’s good for young defensemen to watch a game from above and gain the benefit of a certain perspective or vantage point that might be part of the learning process,” Sullivan said before the game. “But ultimately, at the end of the day, we’re going to try to put the best six guys in the lineup that are going to help us win.”

7. Sullivan has shown confidence in Robertson this season, but a couple of young forwards are struggling to gain trust. That’s been obvious with Brennan Othmann, who’s been limited to six appearances and hasn’t logged more than 10:43 time on ice in any of the last five. And it’s become increasingly clear with Brett Berard, who played only 7:27 in the Winter Classic and came right back out of the lineup Monday.

Sullivan explained his reasoning following Sunday’s practice, noting that he values veteran Justin Dowling because he prefers dressing more than four forwards who are capable of playing center. He also inserted Anton Blidh for his “disruptive” forechecking skills. Neither logged more than 7:53 against Utah, though, highlighting the puzzling decision to play a couple over-30 AHLers over prospects the organization once viewed as budding NHL contributors. The fact that Othmann and Berard remain on the outside while J.T. Miller, Adam Edström, Noah Laba and Conor Sheary are all hurt is even more telling.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/06000230/USATSI_27938310-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-06 12:02:02.028912

The final game of the season was decided on a field goal that sailed wide right, eliminating the kicking team from the playoffs.

Those two games represented the bookends to another chaotic regular season of football, which — as usual — featured some shocking results. After finishing in last place in their divisions in 2024, both the New England Patriots and Chicago Bears won their respective divisions in 2025. Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow — mainstays in the playoffs — had their seasons ended early thanks to injuries and poor luck.

Those factors should ensure quite an entertaining postseason. But before those games start, there's still a few things left to figure out. The Atlanta Falcons got in front of every other team Sunday, when it fired both head coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot.

The Cleveland Browns didn't wait much longer, firing Kevin Stefanski on Monday. Then, the Raiders were soon to follow, firing Pete Carroll just one season into his three-year contract. The Arizona Cardinals went down that same path, axing Jonathan Gannon on Monday after three seasons.

They won't be the only ones to go. Which coaches and general managers will get the axe before the playoffs begin? And which players will return to action as their teams prepare for the stretch run?

Reporters approached Tagovailoa at his locker Monday, and the veteran quarterback said that he ""would be good with"" a new opportunity elsewhere. The reporters made sure that he understood the question was about a fresh start with a team other than the Dolphins, according to the Miami Herald,. Tagovailoa said he understood but declined to comment further.

""That would be dope,"" Tagovailoa said of the potential to start 2026 anew.

Tagovailoa ceded the starting job in Week 16 after he set a new career highs in interceptions (15) and sacks (30) and posted the lowest QBR of his six-year run in Miami. Although he helped spark a late-season turnaround in which the Dolphins won four consecutive games, he went just 6-8 as the starter and turned in his first losing record.

The low points for Tagovailoa were abnormally dramatic. His season reached an impasse in October when he threw three interceptions in a loss to the Los Angeles Chargers and tossed three more the following week in a 31-6 drubbing at the hands of the Cleveland Browns.

Miami has seen Tagovailoa at his best, though, and could reinsert him into the lineup in 2026 if it feels he is capable of returning to elite form. The former No. 5 overall pick led the NFL in completion percentage in 2024 and was the league's passing leader in 2023. He also paced the NFL in yards per attempt in 2022. All of that is to say Tagovailoa is not far removed from performing like one of the top quarterbacks in the league.

Moving on from Tagovailoa entirely would come with its challenges. The Dolphins inked their franchise quarterback to a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension in July 2024 and guaranteed him $167 million. He is under contract through 2028 and carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026. Releasing Tagovailoa is likely off the table, so the Dolphins would need to find a trade partner willing to take on his sizable salary.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/05/d0a3b0df-9dae-4c80-9599-d5888f77e619/thumbnail/1200x675/237b04c63372aa573ae8c560ff0cee7b/gettyimages-2253019195-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:58:09.407555

City confirmed the Croatia international will undergo surgery later this week, the results of which would give the full extent of the diagnosis and potential timeframe for absence.

Earlier on Monday, City recalled centre-back Max Alleyne from his season-long loan at Watford after Pep Guardiola said on Sunday that Gvardiol and team-mate Ruben Dias could miss time with injury.

Dias and Gvardiol were substituted in the second half of City’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Sunday. Gvardiol was replaced in the 51st minute by Abdukodir Khusanov after a collision with Chelsea full-back Malo Gusto and had to be helped off the pitch, while Dias was substituted 30 minutes later.

This adds to City’s issues in defence, with John Stones sidelined with a thigh injury sustained in early December. Nathan Ake has only been used sparingly after undergoing foot surgery last season, making just two Premier League starts this campaign.

Due to City’s defensive issues, they have recalled the 20-year-old Alleyne from his loan spell in the Championship. The City youth graduate made 17 appearances for the second division side.

Alleyne has represented England at every youth level from under-17 to under-21, and was an unused substitute for City’s first team on seven occasions last season, including in the Premier League and Club World Cup.

At his post-match press conference on Sunday, Guardiola did not put a timeframe on Gvardiol and Dias’ injuries but added that both are likely to miss time.

“We will see tomorrow (about the extent of Gvardiol’s injury), but it doesn’t look good for him or Ruben,” Guardiola said, via the City website. “I didn’t speak with the doctor but if Ruben is out, it is because he felt something.

“Of course, we have a lot (of injuries). John Stones is missing for many months; Ruben will be out and Josko will be out. Always we know with Nathan (Ake) that he cannot play regularly. After what happened last season, if we stay strong, we will find a solution and the spirit will be there.”

When asked if Dias had sustained a muscle injury, Guardiola said: “Yes, it looks like it.”

Khusanov, who missed almost two months himself earlier in the season with an ankle injury, is now a candidate to see an increase in game time, having made just seven starts in all competitions this campaign.

Which day will the Eagles and 49ers play?

The Eagles and 49ers will kick off at 4:30 p.m. Sunday. The game will air on FOX.

Eagles and 49ers postseason history

The Eagles and 49ers have only met twice in postseason history, most recently in the NFC championship game in the 2022 season.

The Eagles won that game, 31-7, before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII. In that game, the 49ers were decimated at quarterback as Brock Purdy and Josh Johnson suffered injuries.

After Johnson exited, Purdy returned to the game in the third quarter, but he was unable to throw the football beyond a few yards. The injuries to San Francisco's quarterbacks led to the NFL approving a rule change that allows teams to play an emergency quarterback if the starter and backup are injured.

The Eagles are 1-1 vs. San Francisco all-time in the playoffs. Philadelphia's loss to the 49ers in the playoffs happened in the wild-card round in 1996.

The title game in the 2022 season between the Eagles and 49ers started a rivalry that boiled over into 2023.

In 2023, the 49ers traveled to Lincoln Financial Field in Week 13 and dominated the Eagles, 42-19. The loss started the infamous collapse for the Eagles to end the season as the Birds lost six of the final seven games, including the playoff exit vs. the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The loss to the Niners in the 2023 season also featured Eagles security chief Dom DiSandro and then-49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw being ejected from the game after a scuffle on the sideline.

The Eagles and 49ers haven't played each other since the 2023 season.

How the Eagles and 49ers got here

The Eagles went 11-6 in the 2025 season and won the NFC East for the second consecutive year, which ended a 20-year stretch of the division not having a repeat winner.

The Niners had a chance to earn the No. 1 seed, but fell to the Seattle Seahawks Saturday night. The 49ers finished the year with a 12-5 record to earn the No. 6 seed.

Eagles-49ers injury report

While the Eagles didn't get the No. 2 seed, they rested most of their starters in hopes of getting healthier heading into the playoffs.

All-Pro right tackle Lane Johnson hasn't played since Week 11 vs. the Detroit Lions, but he's reportedly expected to return for the playoffs.

Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter likely wasn't going to play in the regular season finale, but he popped up on the injury report with a hip injury before Week 18. Linebacker Nakobe Dean has also missed the last two weeks with a hamstring injury.

The 49ers are dealing with several notable injuries heading into the playoffs.

San Francisco is missing star linebacker Fred Warner, who suffered an ankle injury in Week 6, heading into the wild-card round. Niners head coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters that Warner is progressing but not expected to make a return until later in the playoffs if the team advances.

To make matters worse, the Niners lost linebacker Tatum Bethune, who was filling in for Warner, to a season-ending groin injury over the weekend in the Week 18 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. The 49ers are already without top pass rusher Nick Bosa, who tore his ACL early in the season.

On the offensive side of the ball for the Niners, Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams missed Week 18 with a hamstring injury, while wide receiver Ricky Pearsall didn't play due to right knee and ankle injuries.

Shanahan told reporters Monday that Williams and Pearsall will be evaluated later in the week.

On Sunday, while resting Christian Benford and Taron Johnson, Buffalo had no choice but to leave rookie Maxwell Hairston in the game what we now know was too long.

Midway through the fourth quarter of Buffalo’s 35-8 win over the New York Jets, Hairston left the game with an ankle injury. The Bills’ first-round draft pick from the 2025 NFL Draft was seen making his way slowly to the locker room with members of Buffalo’s training staff and was declared doubtful to return with an ankle injury. After the game, there were reports that Hairston was seen in a walking boot.

The rookie missed the first seven weeks of the season after suffering a knee injury in training camp that landed him on Injured Reserve. Once Hairston returned, he has split playing time with Tre’Davious White or started in place of Christian Benford. In his eleven games played, he recorded 18 combined tackles (14 solo), 5 passes defended, and two interceptions.

Buffalo really can’t afford to have the speedster sidelined if they are making a push to still be playing football in February. Don’t forget, they lost Ja’Marcus Ingram to the Houston Texans in the Darius Slay disaster, leaving them one cornerback short and just Dane Jackson and M.J.

Utah forward JJ Peterka drove to the net in hopes of scoring a loose puck and made marginal contact with Shesterkin. The goalie went sprawling into his own net and slammed the ice in pain with his blocker. Shesterkin stayed down for an extended period as trainer Andy Hosler came to attend to him. Eventually, Hosler and Vladislav Gavrikov helped Shesterkin off the ice. The goalie did not appear to put any weight on his left leg, which is not a part of the body Peterka collided with. Shesterkin had to be helped to the dressing room after leaving the ice. Jonathan Quick entered the game in his place.

New York has had a difficult start to the season, going 20-18-5 through its first 43 games. Shesterkin, though, has been consistent in net. He has a .912 save percentage and has stopped 22.63 goals above expected, per Evolving-Hockey. That ranks fourth in the league. He is in the first year of an eight-year, $11.5 million average annual value contract.

The Rangers have already been without Vincent Trocheck, Adam Fox and J.T. Miller for prolonged stretches this season. If Shesterkin misses significant time, it would likely mark a bigger loss than any other player.

Quick has been solid in limited action this season, going 3-6-1 with a .924 save percentage, but he is 39 and best served as a No. 2 goalie at this point.

Mike Macdonald has built a title contender with the key ingredients: dominant defense, rugged running game and clutch quarterback play.","After an NFL regular season that was nothing short of stunning right down to the final snap, now the real fun begins. Starting Saturday, 14 teams will battle it out for the right to play in Super Bowl LX on Feb 8. And with perennial playoff teams like the Chiefs, Vikings, Lions and Ravens out of the picture, new contenders like the Bears, Texans and Jaguars will get their shot. Then there are the Patriots, a franchise that knows something about winning titles yet was one of the biggest surprises of the 2025 season.

Are any of those teams better than the No. 1-seeded Broncos and Seahawks? Let's see where all 14 playoff teams rank headed into Wild Card Weekend.

Entering the playoffs with a sub-.500 record and a two-game losing streak makes it hard to consider Bryce Young & Co. a legitimate threat in the postseason tournament. Although the Panthers have some impressive wins on their résumé, their overall inconsistency makes them a one-and-done candidate in the playoffs.

Aaron Rodgers’ Week 18 heroics give Mike Tomlin and the Steelers a chance to atone for recent playoff failures. Although the Steelers’ flaws make it hard to envision an extended playoff run, their gritty demeanor and competitiveness give them a shot at taking down a more talented squad.

Despite fading badly down the stretch due to injuries and faulty execution, the Packers have enough talent to make a surprising playoff run. Quarterback Jordan Love is an elite talent with enough playmakers around him to light up the scoreboard in a carefully scripted shootout. Although the Packers’ injury-ravaged squad enters the playoffs on a four-game losing streak, the NFC’s No. 7 seed is dangerous in a single-elimination tournament.

Jim Harbaugh’s enigmatic squad is capable of making a deep postseason run, but its success hinges on the play of a decimated offensive line. Without a blue-chip frontline blocker available to deal with the bullies in the trenches, the Chargers will need quarterback Justin Herbert to play at an MVP level to navigate a very competitive AFC field.

Second-year QB Caleb Williams’ late-game magic and the defense’s takeaway prowess give the Bears a chance to knock off a heavyweight in the postseason. Though Ben Johnson would prefer to control the game with a punishing rushing attack led by D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai, the Bears can win grind-it-out affairs or shootouts in the playoffs.

After going all-out in an attempt to claim the No. 1 seed, San Francisco might lack the depth to make a deep playoff run. Without their core defensive stars, the 49ers are forced to rely extensively on their offense to control the game. While Kyle Shanahan’s whiteboard wizardry will test opposing defenses, the 49ers will need defensive coordinator Robert Saleh to craft a masterpiece or two to help them advance through the tournament.

Reigning MVP Josh Allen will need to utilize all of his superpowers to lead the Bills on a Super Bowl run. With NFL rushing champ James Cook capable of alleviating some of the pressure, the Bills could lean on a ground-and-pound approach to control the action against more talented squads. As Sean McDermott contemplates how to maximize his opportunity to win a Super Bowl with Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow out of the running, Buffalo's head coach will need to rely on the Bills’ offensive firepower to get it done.

The defending champs have not played their best football, but they are the most talented team in the field, with a championship pedigree that gives them a significant advantage in high-stakes games. Jalen Hurts has mastered mistake-free football, but the Eagles might need their QB1 to transform from game manager to game changer in the playoffs. With power rusher Jalen Carter and an ultra-talented defense capable of holding opponents to 20 points or fewer, the Eagles could be the last team standing when the confetti falls at the end of Super Bowl LX.

The stingiest defense in the league could spark a Super Bowl run for the Texans. The swarming unit overwhelms opponents with a ferocious pass rush and sticky coverage, leading to three-and-outs and game-changing turnovers. Although the Texans’ pedestrian offense struggles to put points on the board, the defense can make life miserable for opponents by forcing them to play ugly games that lack rhythm and flow.

Despite their record and wild-card status, the Rams are arguably the best team in the tournament. Sean McVay has Matthew Stafford playing at an MVP level, while maintaining a balanced offensive approach that doesn’t put the game solely on the veteran QB's shoulders. Defensively, the Rams can overwhelm opponents with their collective speed and athleticism on the perimeter and their brute strength in the trenches. With the league’s best tactician and schemer leading the way, the Rams are the team to fear in the tournament.

After shocking the football world with 14 wins in Mike Vrabel’s debut season, the Patriots are poised to make a deep playoff run behind an MVP-caliber quarterback thriving in his second NFL season. While Drake Maye’s success as an efficient playmaker has transformed the Patriots’ offense into a juggernaut, the questions persist regarding whether the production is sustainable against elite opponents. With a high-profile postseason game on the horizon, the football world will quickly find out if the young quarterback and his squad are built to handle the playoff pressure.

Locking up the No. 1 seed gives the Broncos a clear path to Super Bowl LX. With Sean Payton’s championship experience and expertise helping Denver acclimate to an ultra-competitive environment, the 14-win team should be prepared to handle the win-or-go-home pressure that makes some teams wilt in the postseason.

The disrespect heaped on the small-market Jaguars has fueled their unexpected emergence as a title contender. First-year coach Liam Coen has played his motivational cards perfectly to elevate his squad’s performance while coaxing MVP-caliber play from Trevor Lawrence. While the football world wonders if the clock will strike midnight on Cinderella in the wild-card round, the big-play quarterback and turnover-obsessed defense could lead to a surprising run that silences the naysayers.

Mike Macdonald has built a title contender with the key ingredients: dominant defense, rugged running game and clutch quarterback play. Despite questions regarding Sam Darnold’s big-game ability, the veteran QB delivered when it mattered for the Seahawks down the stretch in the regular season. With the ""12s"" creating a raucous environment and significant home-field advantage, the Seahawks should be prohibitive favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LX.

LSU fifth-year senior quarterback Garrett Nussmeier can virtually make up for his lost season of 2025 because of a painful abdomen tear injury with one week of practice and/or one game during Senior Bowl week in Mobile, Alabama, from Jan. 26-31.

Nussmeier has agreed to practice and play in the premier NFL pre-draft game, the Senior Bowl announced on Monday. Virtually every NFL general manager, head coach and personnel directors will descend on Mobile.

After injuring his abdomen last August, Nussmeier dealt with the injury for most of his season through nine games, and it showed before he basically opted out, understandably, of the Tigers’ final three regular season games and third-tier Texas Bowl.

In 2024, Nussmeier shot up the NFL draft boards to a high first round pick and potentially the first quarterback to go before a late-season swoon dropped him. But had he declared for the 2025 NFL Draft, he likely would have still been a first round choice. As his 2025 season floundered along with his passes, Nussmeier now finds himself likely falling into the second round.

He is currently the No. 7 quarterback on Mel Kiper’s ESPN list. With impressive showings at the Senior owl and LSU’s Pro Day in the spring, and the NFL Combine in February, if invited, he could rise, kdepending where his abdomen injury is.

LSU safety AJ Haulcy, wide receiver Barion Brown and defensive end Jack Pyburn were previous invitees to the Senior Bowl from the Tigers’ 2025 team.

In 13 games in 2024, Nussmeier completed 337 of 525 passes (64.2 percent) for 4,052 yards (5th in the nation) and 29 touchdowns (10th nationally) with 12 interceptions when healthy and with an offensive line that put four members into the 2025 NFL Draft. His 311.7 yards passing a game for a team that finished 107th in the nation in rushing with 116.4 yards a game.

In nine games in 2025, Nussmeier completed 194 of 288 passes (67.4 percent) for 1,927 yards and 12 touchdowns with five interceptions for a 133.8 efficiency rating. He averaged 214.1 passing yards a game with an even worse running game than the previous season – 124th nationally with 104 yards a game.

“I can’t un-see what I saw in 2024,” new Senior Bowl executive director Drew Fabianich told Tiger Rag on Monday. “So there has to be the why.”

Fabianich was a Dallas Cowboys national scout for 14 years while with Dallas from 2003 through 2021. He is also a former general manager at Auburn (2022-23) and at West Virginia (2023-24) and was the defensive coordinator at Louisiana-Monroe from 1997-2000.

“There has to be an explanation,” Fabianich said. “That difference in the two seasons doesn’t just happen over night.”",https://www.tigerrag.com/wp-content/uploads/LSUFootballVsTexasAM2025_GarrettNussmeier1_JMailhes.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 02:59:02.329986

""He's the most electrifying player there is in this game,"" center Tyler Linderbaum said. ""Shoot, I cut a nose guard loose and he somehow slipped out of it and threw the ball 80 yards for a touchdown. That's the kind of ability he has.""

The Ravens have work to do with Jackson this offseason. His salary cap figure soars to $74.5 million, which accounts for 25% of Baltimore's 2026 salary cap. The team will likely need to get a new contract with Jackson to reduce that cap hit.

Asked whether he feels he will remain with the Ravens amid looming contract talks, Jackson said, ""We just lost a game -- a divisional game -- a game to put us in the playoffs. I'm not even thinking about that right now, to be honest with you. I'm still caught up in what just happened. That's not my focus right now.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0105%2Fr1597048_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 21:13:16.367406

Surgery to repair a damaged AC joint could sideline a thrower for anywhere from six to nine months.","Titans quarterback Cam Ward does not believe he will need surgery for his sprained AC joint.

Ward suffered the right shoulder injury during the season finale against Jacksonville.

The rookie will focus on rehabilitation during the offseason to heal the injury.

Tennessee Titans quarterback Cam Ward told reporters on Jan. 5 that he doesn't think he'll need surgery to repair the sprained AC joint in his right throwing shoulder, which he injured in the Titans' season finale on Jan. 4.

""Just really heal,"" Ward said when asked what the prescription is for how he should handle the injury through the offseason. ""Talked with the trainers. I’ll probably have some rehabbing. Then you just continue to try to get stronger on my shoulder and try to get ready for next year.""

Ward exited the Titans' 41-7 loss against Jacksonville after the team's first offensive series. He rushed in for a touchdown from 7 yards out, lunging over the goal line and landing awkwardly between the football and a diving Jaguars defender.

Ward headed to the locker room shortly thereafter for X-rays and was ruled out for the rest of the game within the half-hour. He returned to the sideline for the second half sporting a sling supporting his right arm and shoulder.

One day later, Ward says he didn't feel or hear a pop in his shoulder. He just sensed soreness. His mind raced through all the possibilities; his first instinct was there was ""too much (expletive) in his head"" all at once. He wanted to get the X-rays done as quickly as possible in hope he'd be able to return to the game.

Ward said he has not been given a timetable yet for when he'll be cleared for football activities.

Cam Ward injury: What's next?

Ward heads into an offseason where rehab has to be the focus. He finished his rookie season with 3,169 yards passing, 15 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He played his best football in December, going on a stretch of four consecutive games with multiple touchdowns as the Titans scored 24 or more points in all four games.

The initial diagnosis on Ward's injury seemed to indicate surgery was likely, with a source telling The Tennessean after the game that the expectation was the injury was ""significant."" Surgery to repair a damaged AC joint could sideline a thrower for anywhere from six to nine months. But with rehab, the process to return should be quicker.

""There is relief for myself and the building,"" Ward said. ""The training staff, they get it right. Continue to walk me through the process of what I need to do to get better and get back on the field.""

Neither Ward nor interim Titans coach Mike McCoy directly ruled out the possibility of surgery, but both indicated that surgery wasn't the likely path at the moment.

As for pain management, Ward answered like a football player.

When asked how the pain of injuring his shoulder compared to other pains experienced on the football field, Ward said: ""I got up off the field, so I was fine.""","https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/04/PNAS/88019288007-usatsi-27930763.jpg?crop=4342,2443,x0,y226&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-06 01:58:38.908180

With an extra week to prepare, thanks to a Bye Week for being the NFC's No. 1 seed, Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald is ""still optimistic"" to get players back from injury and potential injured reserve as well.

Tackle Charles Cross has missed the past three games dealing with a hamstring injury and safety Coby Bryant missed the last two with a knee injury. Neither were placed on injured reserve, which is a good sign they have a chance to return.

Macdonald said, ""I haven't gotten the update on the guys that have been out, but the timetable is still the way we said it at the end of last week where we're still optimistic to have them back either during practice this week or sometime next week.""

At the end last week, Macdonald said three of the players currently on injured reserve, running back George Holani, tight end Eljah Arroyo and linebacker Chazz Surratt all have a chance to return in the playoffs.

The defense was dominant once again.

Seattle's defense held San Francisco to just 173 total yards, the lowest total in nine seasons under Kyle Shanahan, in large part because of their ability to limit explosive plays. 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy didn't attempt a pass of 20 yards or more and completed just four passes anywhere from 10-19 yards.

The defense also held running back Christian McCaffrey to just 23 rushing yards on the night, his lowest total since the 2020 season.

""One of the things that I think we're most proud of, of our defensive tape, is the waves of football, waves of Seahawks that get to the ball,"" Macdonald said. ""And what that does is it allows you to take really aggressive angles. So, I don't feel like I'm just playing by myself out there. And so I feel like our team is really committed to playing in that type of style and that type of speed and that type of effort. And when you do that, you might miss a tackle here or there, but it's going to get cleaned up and you're going to get multiple people at the point of attack where you can limit some of those extra hidden yardages.""

The run game had another great game.

For the third game in a row, Seattle's run game has been the most productive it's been all season. On Saturday, Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet rushed for a combined 171 yards on 33 carries. Walker also surpassed 1,000 yards on the season for the second time in his career. Along with the Seahawks simply sticking to being committed to making the run game work, Macdonald said the coaches also have a better idea of the amount of information they are able to coach the player up on.

""I think we have a better idea of how much we can handle on a week-to-week basis. How many runs can we carry? How many different types of runs? How many different formations can we build it out of? Kind of like how much you put on your quarterback's plate defensively too. It's like, how much stuff can we bring into a game, where we have the right balance of answers and enough scheme to really let us give us an advantage or we feel like it is an advantage. And then there's a balance of that of how much can you actually execute given the amount of reps throughout the week. So I think that's been something that we've kind of chiseled the way at throughout the year and really throughout maybe the last month, probably since the Bye (Week), honestly, or coming out of the Thursday game. I feel like we really had a better understanding of what that balance is.""

The Seahawks also became the only team to have successful four successful runs on third-and-15 or longer. This week it was Walker with a 19-yard run on a third-and-17 in the third quarter to keep the drive alive.

""That's a 12 As One play,"" Macdonald said. ""I mean, everybody hit their targets, they hit their blocks. And then my favorite part of the play is (Jake) Bobo and Jax (Jaxon Smith-Njigba) celebrating more than anybody else. Two receivers on a third and long who got their guys blocked and springing the run that got Ken the first down. It was a heck of a run by Ken, but there's a lot of great blocking going on that play. And then to see the guys celebrate like that for the success of the team and their teammate was really cool.""

Keeping the same mindset through the playoffs.

Yes, they're preparing for a playoff game, but Macdonald has stressed, all season, the importance of, ""sticking to the process"" and that's what Seattle will being doing when they head into the week.

""Part of our message to our guys is, I know we're going to the playoffs, but nothing changes in terms of our preparation, our mentality,"" he said. ""It's the same thing that circumstances around the game people are going to be talking about, but for us, the things that we need to be able to do to be able to have success is going to stay the same.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/dekijfjexahw68zycpsf,N,,2026-01-05 23:59:11.496135

Every Monday, we will bring you information and analysis on the biggest talking points, cutting through the noisy world of all things Barca with reporting you can trust.

The information contained in this article reflects multiple conversations with various sources at the Spanish champions, all of whom wanted to speak anonymously to protect relationships.

What’s the biggest talking point at Barcelona right now?

Barcelona passed a difficult test, beating Espanyol at the RCDE Stadium with their city rivals in top form. After ending 2025 with five straight league wins, Manolo Gonzalez’s side are fifth in La Liga and made the game as difficult as possible.

Barca were crowned La Liga champions on their previous two visits to the ground (in 2023 and 2025). On the first occasion, the derby also saw Espanyol relegated to the second division.

That has fuelled a tense rivalry — taken to new levels by goalkeeper Joan Garcia’s move across town in the summer — but Barca’s 2-0 win strengthened their lead at the top of La Liga.

While they have struggled at times this season, Hansi Flick’s side have more points than at this stage last year. After matchday 19 of the previous campaign, Barca were third with 38 points, five behind Real Madrid in second and six behind leaders Atletico Madrid. They are leading the table with 49 points now, four ahead of Real Madrid.

Now, they travel to Saudi Arabia to play in the Supercopa de Espana, a competition they won last season as part of a domestic treble. In recent seasons, the Supercopa has been a barometer for the rest of the season in Spain — since 2022, the team that has won it has gone on to lift La Liga. Barca face Athletic Club in the semi-final on Wednesday, with a potential final against Atletico Madrid or Real Madrid to follow on Sunday.

Another issue that is beginning to gain traction is what Barca do in the January transfer market: will they use Andreas Christensen’s injury to make a new signing?

Sporting director Deco told Cadena Ser radio last month that Barca would not make any signings in the winter window as they do not tend to work out. But, following the centre-back’s long-term knee injury and the uncertainties around Ronald Araujo’s return (more of which below), the club are looking into the possibility of strengthening their defence.

What did we learn from Saturday’s game?

That this Barcelona team can win while not necessarily being at their best.

“To be honest, we didn’t deserve it,” was Flick’s post-match assessment. The team did not gel in midfield and Pedri, who came on in the 64th minute on his return from a muscle injury, cut a frustrated figure.

Another issue was Raphinha not quite working in attacking midfield. The Brazil winger cannot turn and accelerate in central areas in the same way as Dani Olmo or Fermin Lopez, and it seemed clear his best position remains on the wing.

But we also learned Garcia is here to stay as Barca’s No 1 and can make history at the club. Some voices within Barca have even said, “We have our own Thibaut Courtois” in reference to the 24-year-old.

His saves kept Barca in the game against his old team. It came against a backdrop of genuine hostility towards him. Every time Garcia touched the ball, he was met with deafening whistles and insults, while Espanyol fans held up banners with rats drawn on them.

That he was able to keep a cool head in such a hostile environment provided further proof that Barca did the right thing in signing him (not that it was needed).

The feeling within the club is he could become a Barcelona legend.

Will Barcelona make a move this January transfer window?

Flick is very keen on signing a new defender. The club are exploring what players are available this month, but it is far from a simple situation.

“When we look at our defensive line, I think we need one more player,” the German manager said in his pre-Espanyol press conference on Friday. “It’s something we need to talk about, but it is not easy to get a player of this level in winter.

“I am confident we can do something, but it has to make sense.”

Barcelona have a big problem in defence after Christensen was sidelined for months. Araujo has just returned to train with the first team after being given indefinite leave with the club’s agreement, but there is still no timeframe on his return. He was included in their squad for the Supercopa de Espana but is not expected to play.

All of this leaves Barca with just five defenders — Jules Kounde, Eric Garcia, Pau Cubarsi, Gerard Martin and Alejandro Balde — to cover four positions. One of those, Garcia, is being used in midfield.

The challenge now is to find something that makes sense given the reservations Deco mentioned about the January transfer market.

The sporting director’s top priority was to sign a centre-back in the summer, but the names they were monitoring — such as Crystal Palace’s Marc Guehi and Nico Schlotterbeck of Borussia Dortmund — are not currently for sale. It is also unclear as to whether Barca have the finances for a deal of that size.

Barca remain in a tight position with their La Liga-imposed salary limit, but Christensen’s injury does give them options. As the Denmark international is expected to be out for more than four months, the Catalans could use the long-term injury exception in La Liga’s rulebook to use 80 per cent of his salary space to register a new signing.

But bear in mind that there is a deadline for this. According to the league’s rules, every club that intends to use this exception must notify La Liga at most 25 days after the player is injured. Christensen’s injury happened on December 20, which means Barca need to tell La Liga if they want to register a new signing in his place by January 14.

In an ideal world, Deco would like an experienced player to join on loan until the end of the season to provide depth and competition.

One player liked within Barca’s sporting department is Manchester City’s Nathan Ake. But it is seen as unlikely that City will be open to letting him go on loan until the end of the season without the possibility of a permanent sale. Following injuries to Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias, that option seems even more remote, and City do not envisage letting him go at this point.

A player who has been offered to the club in recent days is Joao Cancelo. The Portugal international is expected to leave Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal this month and would be very keen on re-joining Barca following his loan spell there in the 2023-24 season.

Right-back Cancelo is not the central defender Flick wants, which means the 31-year-old is not seen as the most sensible option, according to club sources.

What might we have missed? What should we look out for?

Araujo’s return happened during the club’s open training session, which Barcelona hold every year around Christmastime. The Uruguayan received a warm welcome from supporters.

After Barca’s Champions League defeat by Chelsea in early December, Araujo asked the club for indefinite leave, a request which was granted. He has not trained nor played since then, although he has been working with a physical trainer who has helped him stay in shape.

He decided to return after the holidays, with club sources saying he may not yet be physically ready to return to the pitch and needs to train more with the group.

“It’s up to him,” Flick said, when asked when he could return to the team. “He’s fine now, physically he may not be 100 per cent, but he’s fine. Besides, it’s up to him to decide how quickly he’s going to come back.”

Araujo will continue to gain match fitness with the squad at the Supercopa.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/05075855/InsideBarca.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-05 23:00:01.892486

So the Lions placed him on injured reserve, and LaPorta got the surgery.
“Hopefully by OTAs I’m up running around, and then, of course, we’ll be in pads in training camp,” LaPorta said.
You just have to assume that you’re going to make it through the game healthy and you’re going to give your best effort every week when you go out,” LaPorta said.
“I was very happy with how I was playing in my third season,” LaPorta said.","There’s been a little mystery surrounding Detroit Lions tight end Sam LaPorta’s back injury that cost him the final eight games of the season. All we’ve really heard is that it required season-ending surgery, and the 2023 second-round pick is expected to be ready by training camp in 2026.

On locker room cleanout day, LaPorta spoke to the media for the first time since the surgery and gave a little more background on what happened. According to LaPorta, he sustained an accumulation of falls and hits in games leading up to the Washington Commanders game in Week 10, but in that game alone, that’s when one of his vertebrae discs “fully herniated.”

“Numbness and tingling and muscle loss–it happened shortly after that,” LaPorta said. “When you can’t do a single-leg calf raise, it’s kinda hard to play football. So that’s kind of where we were at.”

Initially, LaPorta was hoping it was on the minor end of these types of injuries. Sometimes, they can take just a couple weeks to feel better, sometimes it’s closer to a couple months. In extreme cases, it requires surgery, and, unfortunately, after a couple weeks of not improving, the team and LaPorta agreed that he fell into the last category. So the Lions placed him on injured reserve, and LaPorta got the surgery.

“Backs aren’t anything to mess with, and I want to have a long, healthy career, so it was the best route,” LaPorta said.

It’s now been six weeks since the procedure, and LaPorta is excited about the new phase of rehab he’ll be starting this week. He confirmed coach Dan Campbell’s target of being ready by training camp this upcoming offseason.

“Hopefully by OTAs I’m up running around, and then, of course, we’ll be in pads in training camp,” LaPorta said. “So, it’s a lot different than other sports, just to be able to brace for those hits, and the accumulation of a long NFL season, I’ve really got to get this back right before I’m out there running around in pads and taking those hits and such.”

LaPorta said this ordeal—the first major injury of his athletic career—won’t necessarily change how he plays the game. While it’s obviously important to try and stay healthy as long as possible, he’s not going to let one injury cause him to scale back his determination on each play, even if it means absorbing multiple hits.

“You can’t really worry about those things, to be honest. You just have to assume that you’re going to make it through the game healthy and you’re going to give your best effort every week when you go out,” LaPorta said. “The freak accidents happen. You train, you prepare, and get your body as best as you can for the season, and then some things happen, and you’ve just got to live with the results, unfortunately. It’s the game we play.”

LaPorta finished the season with 40 catches for 489 yards in nine contests, a pace that would have produced career-high numbers for a player who was already playing at a Pro Bowl level. That’s not to mention the clear progress he made as a blocker in both the run and pass game. He’s clearly proud of the progress he’s made and is hoping to pick up right where he left off once he’s back on the field again.

“I was very happy with how I was playing in my third season,” LaPorta said. “I felt like I was making strides even from my first and second year, and hopefully an even better player to come in the future once I rehab and get healthy again.”",https://platform.prideofdetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/127/2026/01/gettyimages-2245905348.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.729663053601%2C100%2C78.540673892798&w=1200,N,,2026-01-05 23:00:05.829722

Adams is a player who’s rarely hurt or unavailable, so his absence from the Los Angeles Rams’ lineup not only hurt the offense, but it frustrated him, too.

It was reported by Jay Glazer of FOX on Sunday that Adams was pushing to play against the Arizona Cardinals in the finale but the Rams played it safe and held him out for another week. He also looked good running routes before the Rams’ Monday Night Football game against the Falcons, which was his second missed game.

It’s understandable that the Rams would be cautious with the playoffs approaching, but Adams seemingly didn’t agree with that plan. Sean McVay admitted during his media session on Monday that the Rams’ careful approach “pissed him off pretty good.”

Hamstring injuries are tricky and can be aggravated pretty easily if they're not fully healed, which is exactly what happened with Adams when he got hurt in Week 15. He had been dealing with a hamstring injury in practice for a few weeks and then against the Lions, it finally went on a downfield route where he pulled up lame.

The Rams were protecting against that exact scenario by holding him out until the playoffs, which was in the best interest of everyone. Sure, they could've used him against the Seahawks and Falcons, which might've netted them the No. 1 seed, but they couldn't risk losing him for the rest of the year – including the postseason.

Injury Report

Shanahan opened with updates from Saturday night's game, noting several players who will be evaluated throughout the week.

Linebackers Dee Winters (ankle) and Luke Gifford (quad), defensive lineman Keion White (hamstring), and safety Ji'Ayir Brown (rib) will all be monitored, with Brown listed as day-to-day. Defensive lineman Kalia Davis (knee tendinitis) is also day-to-day.

Linebacker Tatum Bethune suffered a groin tear and will be out for the remainder of the season, with Shanahan acknowledging surgery is a possibility.

""That's something they're still deciding,"" Shanahan said.

Shanahan also provided updates on players who missed the Week 18 contest. Tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) will be evaluated throughout the week, with Pearsall dealing with a reaggravation of his PCL injury.

Meanwhile, wide receiver Jacob Cowing is expected to take a step forward this week, as Shanahan confirmed his practice window will open on Wednesday. Quarterback Brock Purdy checked out fine after taking a late sack against Seattle.

Confidence in Linebacker Depth

With Bethune sidelined and Winters' status uncertain, Shanahan expressed confidence in veteran linebacker Eric Kendricks stepping into a larger role.

""I'm real confident in Eric,"" Shanahan said. ""He's been here long enough. These games he's gotten in the last couple weeks he's done a good job, and I'm glad that we've got him for this situation.""

If Winters is unable to play, Shanahan said Garret Wallow and Curtis Robinson are both options at the weakside linebacker spot.

When asked about the possibility of Fred Warner returning later in the postseason, Shanahan said it's not something the team is considering at this point.

""I think it's too far off right now,"" Shanahan said. ""It is a possibility as we got closer to a possible third game… but it's not something we're thinking about right now.""

Turning the Page to Philadelphia

Once the Wild Card matchup was finalized on Sunday, Shanahan and his staff quickly shifted gears.

""We were excited that it was on a Sunday so we can have a normal seven-day week,"" Shanahan said. ""Now we're getting going on Philly.""

Though early in the game-planning process, Shanahan acknowledged the challenges Philadelphia presents on both sides of the ball.

""We know how good Philly is,"" Shanahan said. ""They have a great defense. They've got a very talented and good offense in terms of how well they run the ball and some of the playmakers they have, and the issue that their quarterback presents.""

Shanahan noted similarities between the Eagles and Seahawks defenses, particularly up front.

""They've got a really good pass rush and tight coverage,"" Shanahan said.

Embracing the Road Ahead

With the postseason now officially underway, Shanahan said the message to the team has been to embrace the challenge, regardless of opponent.

""That's what our guys are ready for,"" Shanahan said. ""I don't think we cared who we played. The main thing was knowing that you've got to go to three on the road to get there to the last game of the season as opposed to two games at home to get there. So, that was the biggest thing in playing the hard way.

""Right now, you can't get picky about who you play, whether it's the defending champs or whether it's the seventh seed. This is the playoffs. Everyone's earned the right to be here. If you want to reach your ultimate goal, you've got to be good enough to beat anybody.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/49ers/ltqs521xeolg6m6auy3d,N,,2026-01-05 19:59:01.563655

Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak reportedly an NFL head coach candidate

The 49ers (12-5) have a chance to get two star offensive players back for a wild-card game at Philadelphia (11-6) on Sunday with coach Kyle Shanahan saying Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) and receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle) will be evaluated later in the week after missing last week’s game.

Bethune had stepped in at middle linebacker after star Fred Warner went down with an ankle injury in Week 6 and was the team’s defensive play-caller on the field for the eight games he started this season.

Bethune got hurt during a Week 18 loss to Seattle and Eric Kendricks will step in to fill that role when the Niners face the Eagles.

Kendricks was signed to the practice squad in late November and played 46 snaps on defense the past three games after being promoted each week to the game day roster. The 33-year-old Kendricks has started 143 regular-season games and six playoff games since entering the league with Minnesota in 2015.

“I’m real confident in Eric,” Shanahan said. “He’s been here long enough. These games he has gotten in the last couple weeks he’s done a good job, and I’m glad that we’ve got him for this situation.”

Shanahan said that Warner is making progress but that any potential return for him wouldn’t come until the NFC title game at the earliest if the 49ers can win their next two games.

The San Francisco offense struggled last week against Seattle’s without Williams and Pearsall as the running game never got going and there were few open receivers downfield.

The Niners have averaged just 2.8 yards per carry running to the left side since Williams got hurt on the opening snap in Week 17.

Pearsall leads San Francisco with eight catches on throws at least 20 yards downfield. Quarterback Brock Purdy didn’t attempt a single deep pass last week in his absence.

In other injury news, linebacker Dee Winters (ankle), LB Luke Gifford (quadriceps) and defensive lineman Keion White (hamstring) will all be evaluated throughout the week to determine whether they can practice or play. Safety Ji’Ayir Brown (ribs) and defensive tackle Kalia Davis (knee) are day to day.

The 49ers will also open the practice window this week for second-year receiver Jacob Cowing, who has been out since injuring his hamstring in August.",https://sports.mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/san-francisco-49ers-seattle-seahawks-tatum-bethune-getty-900.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 21:13:25.393638

Chargers injury updates Harbaugh didn't have much in the way of injury updates when asked on Monday.","The Chargers have drawn the Patriots in the Wild Card Round of the 2025 NFL playoffs.

Here are five takeaways from Chargers Head Coach Jim Harbaugh's Monday press conference.

1. Playoff mindset

Most days after a game, Harbaugh offers up a few smiles or a laugh in his afternoon media session.

Not on this Monday.

With the Bolts road playoff game against the Patriots looming, the Chargers Head Coach was locked in as ever during a media session that lasted fewer than 10 minutes.

""Ready to have at it. I know it's only Monday, but that's the kind of energy that's in the building,"" Harbaugh said.

The Chargers are the No. 7 seed in the AFC playoff field after they finished 11-6 after the 2025 season.

The Patriots, meanwhile, are the second-seeded team in the AFC after New England went 14-3 and won the AFC East.

Harbaugh said Monday that he's excited to see how his team approaches the week ahead in terms of their preparation so they can be ready to go Sunday night.

""I expect a playoff-type of atmosphere. We've all seen that a lot, specifically in Foxborough,"" Harbaugh said. ""Getting ourselves prepared physically, mentally, is the task at hand.""

2. Chargers injury updates

Harbaugh didn't have much in the way of injury updates when asked on Monday.

""I don't have an update on anybody today,"" Harbaugh said. ""Let the treatment occur and Wednesday we'll be able to update on who's participating in practice and in what capacity.""

The Chargers will practice Wednesday, Thursday and Friday before flying to the East Coast on Friday afternoon.

The Bolts do have a few key players to keep an eye on, including Omarion Hampton. The rookie running back is dealing with an ankle injury and did not play in Sunday's regular-season finale in Denver.

""I feel like he's do anything and everything he can to get back as fast as he can,"" Harbaugh said.

Harbaugh was also asked about left tackle Jamaree Salyer, who sustained a hamstring injury in the first quarter of a Week 16 win in Dallas.

Salyer missed the Bolts final two regular-season games but did go through a pregame workout Sunday in Denver.

""Continue to let the treatment occur and the rehab,"" Harbaugh said of Salyer. ""By Wednesday we'll know what participation will be like.""

The status of cornerback Donte Jackson, who suffered an ankle injury against the Broncos, will also be worth watching.

3. Respect for the Patriots

It was a little over a year ago that the Chargers went to New England and scored a 40-7 win that secured a playoff berth.

These are not the same Patriots, as New England has an entirely new coaching staff led by Mike Vrabel, plus plenty of roster improvements that led to a 14-win season.

""The record. Most dramatically,"" Harbaugh said when asked about New England's 10-win turnaround.

Harbaugh was asked Monday about what the hallmark of a Vrabel-coached team is.

Vrabel played linebacker for 14 NFL seasons and was a First-Team All-Pro and Pro Bowler with New England in 2007. He won three Super Bowls as a player with the Patriots and is a member of the team's Hall of Fame.

""The thing that sticks out, his teams play like he played. I do notice that,"" Harbaugh said. ""Tough, gritty, physical, smart, fast. They kind of like to hit like he liked to hit. That's what I've noticed.""

The Patriots defense certainly fits that bill as New England's unit is a disruptive and disciplined group that makes life difficult for the opposition.

New England finished fourth in the NFL in scoring defense (18.8 points per game) and also finished in the Top 10 in key stats such as yards per game (295.2) rushing yards per game (101.7) and first downs allowed per game (17.8).

On a more advanced level, the Patriots ranked ninth in defensive EPA per game.

""The most important categories they're top five, top 10 — Points per game, run defense,"" Harbaugh said. ""It's not a lot of takeaways, that's not in the top 10, but it's really good, sound. Able to play a 3-4 team that can play as an 4-3 team, a 4-3 team that can go to a five-man line.

""Hallmarks in their coverages, which they play really well. They play the single-high, split-safety, all really good, effective. Very downhill, very physical, very good tacklers. Really sound,"" Harbaugh added. ""Player driven, they put players in position to be successful. They do a great job with that. Long list of things that they do well.""

The Patriots defense tied for 18th in 2025 with 19 total takeaways.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/chargers/pho0dcpkwmjvudnvs1lf,N,,2026-01-05 21:13:28.353606

Bills head coach Sean McDermott ruled out rookie cornerback Maxwell Hairston for Sunday's Wild Card matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars due to an ankle injury.

Hairston got banged up at the end of Week 18 against the Jets, exiting the game and heading to the locker rooms with the training staff.

""Probably more week to week, if I had to guess, right now, but we'll see where it goes,"" McDermott shared.

Buffalo received better news on kicker Matt Prater who left the game with a right quad injury. Prater got hurt during the first half and was ruled out after half time. However it does not appear to be as serious as the kicker's initial quad injury that caused him to miss two Weeks 15 and 16.

""He's more day to day, which is a good sign, but we're still going to, more than likely, bring some kickers in tomorrow (Tuesday) for a workout,"" McDermott said.

The Bills will have two plans this week, one for if Prater can play against Jacksonville and one for if he can't.

RB Ty Johnson is day to day as well. Additionally, Buffalo won't be activating anyone off IR this week.

Praise for Cook's rushing title

Sean McDermott was just like a lot of us Sunday night of Week 18, sweating out the results of Sunday Night Football between the Ravens and Steelers.

Coming into the game, James Cook III had a 152-yard lead on RB Derrick Henry for the NFL rushing title. It appeared as if Henry was poised to pass the Bills RB with 112 yards in the first half.

""I knew the number, and I stayed up to do everything I could to make sure it was going to go the way it was going to go — not that I had any control at that point,"" McDermott laughed.

Originally, the Bills had planned to play Cook for a full quarter against the Jets in hopes of boosting his chances to have the league's most rushing yards. With the Bills resting many starters McDermott changed course and pulled Cook after he got two carries for 15 yards on the first two plays of the game.

""I was watching the (Ravens-Steelers) game, and you know, I'm praying that we made the right decision. And tell you what, it's not easy. You expose him too long, and maybe he gets hurt, and you're not loving it. So you try to do your best to keep him healthy, but also get him to a spot where he can kind of reap the fruits of his labor,"" McDermott said.

OC Joe Brady said he's proud of the way Cook handled this entire season, from the summer negotiations surrounding his contract to now proving why he belongs in the conversation for the NFL's top running back.

""All he's done is just showed up to work and absolutely put on an incredible performance this year. I couldn't be happier for him. Not often do guys get paid and then take their game up to another level,"" Brady said.

Cook finished the regular season with 307 carries for 1,621 yards and 12 rushing TDs.

Early look at the explosive Jags offense

Since Week 10, the Jaguars rank first in the AFC in points scored, averaging 33.1 points per game. They boast an 8-1 record during that span, the second-best win percentage by an AFC team

While the Jaguars have improved in several areas this year, one of the biggest impacts has been the addition of WR Jakobi Myers who joined the team at the trade deadline. Meyers' Jacksonville debut came in Week 10 against the Texans.

""I thought one of the moves that's made a difference for them offensively is adding Jakobi Meyers. Good pickup for them, probably a guy that's quite honestly been undervalued in his career,"" McDermott said.

Meyers is just one of a handful of reliable playmakers the Jaguars have on offense. RB Travis Etienne recorded over 1,000 rushing yards for the third time in four seasons, WR Parker Washington leads the team with 347 receiving yards and two touchdowns in the last three games.

It's all buoyed by QB Trevor Lawrence who is playing some of the best football of his career. Lawrence set the Jags' franchise record with 38 total TDs in 2025, just one fewer than Bills QB Josh Allen.

""You just see Trevor's comfortable, he's comfortable in the offense, "" DC Bobby Babich said. ""He's comfortable in their operation with what they're doing. They do some good things on offense, and they've got some talent around, which certainly helps.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bills/heba6if9bswwvjfadxuu,N,,2026-01-05 19:00:37.927762

Exit interviews will occur over the next few days as the team moves into offseason mode.

""We just didn't execute and that is what you are supposed to do to be successful as an offense,"" noted receiver Jalen McMillan. ""We just have to hit on all cylinders next year and figure it out.""

After a 6-2 start to the season, the Bucs fell to 7-9 prior to the Week 18 clash with the Panthers on Saturday. A myriad of factors contributed to the club's roller-coaster year, including injuries, offensive lulls, lack of consistent pressure by the defensive front, mental lapses and self-inflicted wounds. McMillan, who worked his way back from a significant neck injury sustained in the second preseason game against the Steelers, took a retrospective glance at what he gleaned from 2025 and the rehabilitation process.

""Adversity is going to creep around the corner but it taught me that I am resilient and I am strong and that I can really face anything that comes my way,"" described McMillan.

McMillan rigorously worked his way back and suited up against the Falcons on Thursday Night Football in Week 15. In just his third game after returning from injury, McMillan recorded a career-high 114 receiving yards on a career-best seven receptions against Miami. It marked the first 100-yard receiving game of McMillan's career, with his previous high being 75 yards on Dec. 15, 2024 at the Los Angeles Chargers. McMillan's 33-yard catch in the second quarter matched his career long and the second-year receiver ignited the offense. He created a spark, galvanizing the squad with his route-running acumen and quickness in and out of breaks. McMillan credited future Hall of Famer Mike Evans for bolstering his confidence down the stretch.

Final evaluations for the 2025 NFL Draft's rookie class are in order after the regular season's conclusion. A slew of first-round picks looked like future stars, and several later-round selections were similarly promising.

Here was each team's most impactful rookie, determined by a combination of immediate contributions, PFF grades and workload.

Arizona Cardinals: DI Walter Nolen (Round 1, No. 16 Overall)

Nolen missed much of the campaign due to calf and knee injuries before being placed on injured reserve due to a separate knee injury suffered in Week 16. In between those ailments, the first-round pick played 169 snaps across six appearances and looked like a game-wrecker.

He recorded the seventh-most quarterback pressures (15, tied) among rookie interior defenders, and his 13.0% pass-rush win rate placed him 16th among 148 interior defenders who logged at least 75 pass-rushing snaps.

Atlanta Falcons: S Xavier Watts (Round 3, No. 96 Overall)

The 36th-ranked player on the 2025 PFF Big Board fell to the 96th overall pick, where the Falcons traded up to make him a key piece of their rebuilt defense. It was regarded as a steal at the time, and it’s looking like a steal now.

Watts was one of only two rookie defenders to log 1,000 snaps this regular season, playing a starter’s workload for all 17 of Atlanta’s contests. His five interceptions tied for the second most among safeties. He also managed to avoid the typical rookie tackling woes, notching an 8.6% missed tackle rate, which places him 19th among 107 qualifying safeties.

Baltimore Ravens: S Malaki Starks (Round 1, No. 27 Overall)

The Ravens wasted little time in making Starks and linebacker Teddye Buchanan locked-in starters as rookies. While the team’s defense ultimately failed to match the franchise’s reputation for hard-nosed, stout play, Starks morphed into an important playmaker for the unit.

Like the Falcons’ Xavier Watts, highlighted above, Starks was one of two rookies to log 1,000 defensive snaps this regular season. He was the NFL’s highest-graded defender from Weeks 9-10, and his 80.8 PFF run-defense grade from Weeks 14-18 ranked fifth among safeties.

Buffalo Bills: TE Jackson Hawes (Round 5, No. 173 Overall)

Hawes caught all of 16 passes as a redshirt senior at Georgia Tech, but he was one of only seven Power Four tight ends to earn 70.0-plus PFF pass-blocking and run-blocking grades. The Bills have used that skill set to perfection.

The fifth-round pick ended his rookie regular-season campaign as the NFL’s highest-graded rookie (85.2), powered by his blocking prowess. He was one of just three tight ends with 70.0-plus PFF pass-blocking and run-blocking grades, and he even contributed three scores and 187 receiving yards to a Bills offense in need of reliable pass catchers.

Carolina Panthers: WR Tetairoa McMillan (Round 1, No. 8 Overall)

McMillan became the second-ever Panthers rookie to surpass 1,000 receiving yards — and the only first-year player to accomplish the feat this season. In doing so, he solidified himself as a No. 1 target for quarterback Bryce Young for years to come.

The 22-year-old managed 55 first-down receptions — the seventh most among all receivers. Drops, seven of them, proved to be an issue, but McMillan never lost Young’s trust. His 120 targets were 61 more than the next-closest Panthers receiver.

Chicago Bears: T Ozzy Trapilo (Round 2, No. 56 Overall)

Tight end Colston Loveland and wide receiver Luther Burden III came on strong to close out the Bears’ 2025 regular season, leading the team with 597 and 481 receiving yards, respectively, since Week 9. But as good as they were, Trapilo provided arguably even more value.

Since he became a starter at left tackle in Week 12, the second-rounder allowed just 13 quarterback pressures. His 77.7 PFF pass-blocking grade over the span was better than all but that of Chiefs first-rounder Josh Simmons. That helped quarterback Caleb Williams work from a clean pocket 64.8% of the time during that stretch — the 13th-best rate in the NFL.

Cincinnati Bengals: G Dylan Fairchild (Round 3, No. 81 Overall)

The Bengals’ rookie class took its lumps, from linebackers Barrett Carter and Demetrius Knight Jr. to edge defender Shemar Stewart. Fairchild was a bright spot, however.

Cincinnati made Fairchild a starter at left guard from Week 1. While he went through a rough patch, surrendering 14 quarterback pressures across his first five outings, he settled in by the regular season’s end. From Week 13 onward, he slotted in as the 11th-best pass-blocking guard (78.5), with only eight pressures allowed over the six-game stretch.

Cleveland Browns: LB Carson Schwesinger (Round 2, No. 33 Overall)

Schwesinger just missed out on hearing his name called as a first-rounder, but his play this season was that of a Day 1 pick.

Before the UCLA product missed the Browns’ season-finale win over the Bengals due to quad and ankle injuries, he amassed 958 defensive snaps and 106 solo tackles — both top-25 marks among linebackers. Only five linebackers tallied more run stops than his 37.

Highest-Graded Rookie LBs Since 2023

Dallas Cowboys: G Tyler Booker (Round 1, No. 12 Overall)

The Cowboys keep using first-round picks on offensive linemen, and they keep hitting. Booker is well in line to star on Dallas’ line for the long haul, joining 2022 first-rounder Tyler Smith and 2024 first-rounder Tyler Guyton.

No rookie guard earned a better PFF overall grade than Booker (72.0) during the regular season. His advanced work as a run blocker resulted in a 17.5% impact-block rate, which ranked 11th among 102 qualifying guards.

Denver Broncos: RB RJ Harvey (Round 2, No. 60 Overall)

Broncos head coach Sean Payton opened the season with free-agent signing JK Dobbins as his lead running back, and Dobbins excelled to the point of ranking fifth in the NFL in rushing yards through Week 10 (772). But a season-ending Lisfranc injury thrust Harvey into a bigger role.

While Harvey never truly broke out, he showed flashes of bell-cow potential. He saw the eighth-most targets among running backs (57) and found the end zone 12 times overall. Despite his uninspiring 69.2 PFF rushing grade (T-52nd), Harvey is in line to lead Denver’s backfield in 2026 after showing off an all-around skill set this regular season.

Detroit Lions: G Tate Ratledge (Round 2, No. 57 Overall)

Ratledge entered the 2025 campaign tasked with filling the shoes of Kevin Zeitler, who earned a near-elite 86.5 PFF overall grade in 2024. The rookie got his NFL career off to a strong start, posting the 12th-best PFF run-blocking grade (73.5) among guards.

Pass blocking proved to be a challenge for the right guard, but, like many other rookies, he improved as the season wore on. He gave up six pressures and no sacks across his final seven outings after surrendering 18 pressures and two sacks over his first 10 games.

Green Bay Packers: WR Matthew Golden (Round 1, No. 23 Overall)

One wouldn’t assume that Golden was the Packers’ most impactful rookie by looking at a stat sheet. It’s true that his box score — 29 catches for 361 yards and no touchdowns — tells the story of his season, though: Green Bay didn’t use him much.

The Packers sent just 40 targets his way during the regular season, the fewest for a rookie first-round wide receiver (minimum 200 receiving snaps) since Darrius Heyward-Bey’s 38 in 2009. Yet, no rookie receiver who saw more than 25 catchable targets this regular season hauled in a higher percentage of passes than Golden (96.7%). He did what he could on his meager workload, earning a 68.1 PFF receiving grade.

Houston Texans: RB Woody Marks (Round 4, No. 116 Overall)

Marks handled just 12 carries in the Texans’ first three games, despite Joe Mixon’s lingering foot injury. Soon enough, Nick Chubb began ceding work to the rookie, who went on to log 184 more rushes, albeit for just 3.6 yards per carry.

Marks will have to improve his efficiency numbers to remain at the forefront of Houston’s rush attack, though. His 2.59 yards after contact per attempt average ranked last among qualifying rookie runners, and he forced fewer missed tackles (27) than several first-year players with fewer carries, including Jacory Croskey-Merritt and TreVeyon Henderson.

Indianapolis Colts: TE Tyler Warren (Round 1, No. 14 Overall)

The tight end position appears to be evolving, with younger players producing earlier in their NFL careers. Since at least 2006, when PFF began collecting data, the 2025 tight end class ranked first in targets, receptions, yards, first downs and a host of other categories.

Warren led the way in each of those facets, although his production dipped after Colts quarterback Daniel Jones’ season-ending Achilles injury. His 106 targets in the regular season were the most by an Indianapolis tight end since Eric Ebron in 2018.

Jacksonville Jaguars: WR/CB Travis Hunter (Round 1, No. 2 Overall)

Although Hunter’s season was cut well short, after seven games, by a knee injury, his impact in that short span is deserving of an inclusion here.

Hunter ranked second among rookie cornerbacks in PFF coverage grade (72.7), and he contributed 298 receiving yards and a touchdown as a receiver. His final game was his best: eight catches for 101 yards and a score, in addition to a pass breakup on the only target into his coverage.

Kansas City Chiefs: T Josh Simmons (Round 1, No. 32 Overall)

Stability at left tackle has been hard to come by for the Chiefs, who have cycled through several lackluster options since Orlando Brown Jr. departed in free agency ahead of the 2023 season.

Simmons may well be the team’s long-term answer at that spot. His 75.5 PFF pass-blocking grade is easily the best mark among any Chiefs player to see snaps at left tackle since Brown yielded the role. Simmons missed a chunk of the season due to personal reasons but still made a significant impact for Kansas City.

Las Vegas Raiders: RB Ashton Jeanty (Round 1, No. 6 Overall)

No rookie would have been able to singlehandedly salvage the Raiders’ woeful 2025 season, although the weight of the world was placed on Jeanty’s shoulders to do so at the beginning of the campaign.

Jeanty endured an overwhelmingly disappointing year, and yet, he was still the most impactful Las Vegas rookie. Only James Cook, Jahmyr Gibbs, Jonathan Taylor and Bijan Robinson forced more missed tackles, putting the No. 6 overall pick in excellent company. He fought through poor offensive line play, generating just 0.6 yards before contact — the third-worst average among running backs with at least 100 carries.

Los Angeles Rams: EDGE Josaiah Stewart (Round 3, No. 90 Overall)

Hitting on defensive line draft picks has become a specialty of general manager Les Snead, from Aaron Donald and Michael Brockers to Kobie Turner and Jared Verse, among many others.

Stewart is aiming to join that list. He ranked behind only the Giants’ Abdul Carter in PFF pass-rush grade (74.0) among rookie edge defenders, and his 15.3% pass-rush win rate even bested that of the No. 3 overall pick.

Los Angeles Chargers: S R.J. Mickens (Round 6, No. 214 Overall)

Running back Omarion Hampton and tight end Oronde Gadsden II are viable candidates here, but Mickens, a sixth-round pick, provided unprecedented depth for the team at safety.

While he saw just nine targets across 219 coverage snaps, Mickens nabbed two interceptions. That effort resulted in a 12.5 passer rating allowed in coverage — the top mark among 107 qualifying safeties this regular season.

Miami Dolphins: RB Ollie Gordon II (Round 6, No. 179 Overall)

It was a rather disastrous year for the Dolphins’ rookie class. Gordon was the lone member of eight qualifiers to play 100 or more snaps and record a 60.0-plus PFF overall grade.

When Miami’s crowded backfield didn’t hold him back, Gordon tended to produce. He averaged more than 4.2 yards per carry and earned a 70.0-plus PFF rushing grade in three games of the four games in which he logged at least nine carries. In all other games, he provided a combined 1.7 yards per rush.

Minnesota Vikings: G Donovan Jackson (Round 1, No. 24 Overall)

The Vikings will feel good about Jackson anchoring their interior offensive line for the foreseeable future after his flashes as a rookie.

It wasn’t always pretty for the left guard, who earned a 38.8 PFF pass-blocking grade in Week 2 and a 19.6 mark in Week 15, but he went his final nine outings without allowing a sack and produced a career-high 70.8 PFF run-blocking grade in Week 16.

New England Patriots: T Will Campbell (Round 1, No. 4 Overall)

This year’s first-round offensive linemen fared particularly well, led by Campbell, whose season isn’t done yet after the Patriots secured the AFC’s No. 2 seed.

The Patriots ended the 2024 season with PFF’s last-ranked offensive line. Campbell turned the tide for the unit, earning a team-high 76.1 PFF pass-blocking grade across 476 pass-blocking snaps.

New Orleans Saints: QB Tyler Shough (Round 2, No. 40 Overall)

The Saints’ front office calmly stared down salary-cap purgatory before changing the franchise’s trajectory by drafting Shough and tackle Kelvin Banks Jr.

Shough delivered the 15th-best PFF passing grade since Week 9, when he became New Orleans’ full-time starter, to rank ahead of players such as Jalen Hurts, Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert and Sam Darnold. Only five qualifying passers posted a lower turnover-worthy play rate than the rookie (2.2%).

New York Giants: QB Jaxson Dart (Round 1, No. 25 Overall)

Dart paired with running back Cam Skattebo to bring a new energy to the Giants’ offense. While that was short-lived, with Skattebo suffering a season-ending leg injury in Week 8, Dart remained a big-play threat for the 4-13 Giants.

The Ole Miss product ranked eighth in big-time throw rate (5.2%), and his 38 first-down runs were the fifth most in a regular season for a rookie quarterback over the past 10 years.

New York Jets: T Armand Membou (Round 1, No. 7 Overall)

Membou finished the regular season as one of just 10 tackles leaguewide to play 1,000-plus snaps and earn a 70.0-plus PFF overall grade. And he was one of only two rookies to do so.

The 21-year-old is poised to pair with Olu Fashanu to propel the Jets’ line into the next era with a new quarterback in 2026 and beyond. The rookie’s 5.4% pressure rate allowed ranked 29th among 98 qualifying tackles.

Philadelphia Eagles: LB Jihaad Campbell (Round 1, No. 31 Overall)

The Eagles leaned on Campbell early in the campaign before Nakobe Dean’s return from injury in Week 7. The rookie linebacker was then largely phased out of Philadelphia’s plans, despite his strong play.

From Weeks 1-7, Campbell was the NFL’s ninth-highest-graded linebacker (82.5). As a mostly part-time player from Weeks 8-16, he ranked 61st (52.4). He reassumed a starting role in Weeks 17 and 18 with Dean sidelined and again displayed positive play, earning 70.3 and 64.8 PFF overall grades.

Pittsburgh Steelers: DI Derrick Harmon (Round 1, No. 21 Overall)

The Steelers chose not to utilize rookie running back Kaleb Johnson (51 snaps) in his rookie season, so their three rookie defensive linemen are the options here. None earned a 60.0-plus PFF overall grade, though.

Regardless, Harmon proved to be a force at times. Without him on the field, the Steelers allowed 4.5 yards per carry this regular season. With him, the defense surrendered 3.8 yards per carry.

San Francisco 49ers: CB Upton Stout (Round 3, No. 100 Overall)

Stout saw playing time in 16 games this regular season, developing into an effective run defender, coverage player, and part-time blitzer along the way.

He turned in an 87.5 PFF coverage grade from Weeks 11-18, the second-best figure among all cornerbacks. Over that span, he broke up three passes and surrendered zero touchdowns on 34 targets in coverage. Stout also added 17 tackles in run defense this regular season to put himself in the top 15 at the position.

Seattle Seahawks: S Nick Emmanwori (Round 2, No. 35 Overall)

The athletic Emmanwori made his starting debut in earnest in Week 5 after suffering a high ankle sprain following four snaps in Week 1, and it was everything the Seahawks’ front office could have hoped for.

He finished that game as the NFL’s third-highest-graded safety (81.4) for the week, and he went on to earn 70.0-plus marks in run defense and coverage for the regular season, albeit with some occasional hiccups. Seattle’s stout defense wouldn’t be where it is — powering the NFC’s top-seeded playoff team — without Emmanwori.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers: WR Emeka Egbuka (Round 1, No. 19 Overall)

What a start to Egbuka’s rookie season it was. With Chris Godwin, Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan all sidelined for stints, Egbuka turned NFL defenses into his playground.

Through Week 10, he ranked ninth in receiving yards (677), fourth in touchdowns (six, tied) and 22nd in yards per route run (2.20). But as Tampa Bay’s wide receiver room grew healthy, Egbuka’s role diminished, and he logged only 23 catches for 261 yards and no scores the rest of the way. He was still a key piece of the Buccaneers’ 6-2 start before things came crashing down.

Tennessee Titans: WR Chimere Dike (Round 4, No. 103 Overall)

Cam Ward provided the Titans with hope for the future at quarterback, the likely leader of the franchise for years to come. Dike, meanwhile, brought immediate pep to the team.

The Titans gave the fourth-rounder the keys to special teams stardom, allowing him to average a league-high 17.9 yards per punt return, take two returns back for scores and earn an elite 91.0 PFF punt-return grade. On offense, he saw the fourth-most targets among rookie wide receivers (73) and secured four more touchdowns.

Washington Commanders: T Josh Conerly Jr. (Round 1, No. 29 Overall)

It’s hard to overstate the impact of a stalwart offensive line bookend. Conerly has work to do after conceding eight sacks this season — four of which came in Weeks 1 and 2 — but he improved down the stretch.",https://media.pff.com/2026/01/Shough-Tyler-Feature-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675,N,,2026-01-05 19:59:13.875022

That diagnosis was seemingly confirmed Monday, as Ian Rapoport said exams revealed a sprained AC joint that will not require surgery. It's the best-case scenario for Ward as he heads into the offseason.

Ward left the game after scoring a running touchdown on Tennessee's opening drive that stood as its only score of the game. He took a shot to his upper body as he crossed the goal line and went into the sideline medical tent after the play. He then walked to the locker room on the ensuing Jacksonville possession.

Ward did not return to the lineup for Tennessee's next possession. His backup, Brandon Allen, took over at quarterback and the Titans eventually lost, 41-7.

Purdy sustained a left shoulder stinger in the middle of a Seattle sandwich sack on his last snap of the game in a 13-3 loss to the Seahawks Saturday night in the regular-season finale at Levi’s Stadium.

“Brock checked out good,” coach Kyle Shanahan said Monday in a conference call with local writers.

The 49ers (12-5) visit defending Super Bowl champion and NFC East winner Philadelphia (11-6) Sunday at Lincoln Financial Field (1:30 p.m., Fox).

The most significant injury was to middle linebacker Tatum Bethune, who had a groin tear and will miss the rest of the season. He’ll be replaced by Eric Kendricks, a veteran who was signed Nov. 26.

Players who will be evaluated throughout the week include left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring), wide receiver Ricky Pearsall Jr. (knee/ankle), linebacker Dee Winters (ankle), defensive end Keion White (hamstring) and linebacker Luke Gifford (quad).

Williams and Pearsall did not play against Seattle. The 49ers are 4-13 in games Williams has missed due to injury since he arrived. Pearsall, who has missed nine games, provides the 49ers with the most separation and downfield ability among their receiving corps.

Those considered “day to day” are safety Ji’Ayir Brown (ribs) and defensive tackle Kalia Davis (knee tendonitis).

What is “day to day” as opposed to being evaluated throughout the week?

“It means it’s Monday and there’s a chance they might be good by Wednesday, or a chance they might be good by tomorrow,” Shanahan said. “The other ones we see as more evaluated throughout the week.”

In other developments, the 49ers will open the practice window on wide receiver Jacob Cowing, a second-year receiver and return specialist who has missed all season with a hamstring injury. He will practice Wednesday.

Shanahan said linebacker Fred Warner is not ready to begin practicing after suffering an ankle dislocation and fracture in October. Warner has said he is hoping to return on a deep playoff run.

“I think it’s too far off right now,” Shanahan said. “I think it’s a possibility, if we get to a championship game, but it’s not something we’re thinking about right now.”

That leaves the 49ers with the possibility of being very short-handed at linebacker against the Eagles, whose running game dropped off in 2025 but still prefers to play smash-mouth whenever possible with Saquon Barkley and quarterback Jalen Hurts.

With Bethune out and Winters and Gifford up in the air, Kendricks takes over in the middle with Curtis Robinson and Grant Wallow potentially getting more defensive snaps. The only practice squad linebacker other than Kendricks is Jalen Graham. Nick Martin was placed on injured reserve with concussion symptoms and is not yet eligible to be activated even when he clears protocol.

“I’m real confident in Eric,” Shanahan said. “He’s been here long enough. These games he has gotten in the last couple weeks he’s done a good job, and I’m glad we got him for this situation.”

What happened against Seattle?

Shanahan said the Seahawks game tape wasn’t much different from what he saw with his own two eyes.

“It was very, very much what we expected to see,” Shanahan said. “We knew we had a big challenge and we thought we had to play at our best. And we did not play our best. Give credit to them for that. We made too many mistakes, and when you’re in the situation we are, there’s not much room for mistakes.”

With missed tackles and being beaten on the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball a problem throughout, Shanahan considered the possibility that playing three games in 13 days prior to the Seattle game took its toll.

“I mean, that definitely doesn’t make it any easier,” Shanahan said. “I think that stuff adds up, and it does with injuries and stuff too. But that can’t be our excuse for it. You’ve got to find a way to do it.”

Shanahan was pleased the game was on a Sunday to get back on their usual schedule.

“We were excited that it was on a Sunday so we can have a normal seven-day week,” Shanahan said. “We came in this morning treating it like a Monday, just finished with the players and put the Seattle game to bed with them and we’re getting going on Philly.”

One player who rose to the occasion was rookie slot corner Upton Stout, who showed up both defending the pass and the run.

“I thought it might have been his best game of the year,” Shanahan said. “I thought he had an awesome game.”

Moving on up?

The Miami Dolphins have requested interviews with three members of the 49ers’ front office for their vacant general manager position, according to the NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero: assistant general manager R.J. Gillen, V.P. of player personnel Tariq Ahmad and scouting director Josh Williams.

Miami is coached by former 49ers assistant Mike McDaniel.

Snap judgments

A look at who played and how much in the 2025 regular season:

1,120: Last season right guard Dominick Puni missed one snap all season. This year he missed three. Rebounded to play well after a rough start. Right tackle Colton McKivitz (1,117), left tackle Trent Williams (997) played one snap in Week 17 and sat out Week 18 with a hamstring injury, while center Jake Brendel (950) missed two games.

1,066: Cornerback Deommodore Lenoir was on the field 98.3 percent of the time with no slot corner responsibilities. Had his moments but was more effective handling both roles in 2024. Lenoir was the only defensive player with more than 1,000 snaps.

932: Christian McCaffrey played 82.9 percent of the snaps and had 413 touches, meaning he had the ball on 44.3 percent of the snaps he was in the game. No back in the NFL was on the field as much or touched the ball more. Trade acquisition Brian Robinson didn’t miss a game but played just 190 snaps.

795: Wide receiver Jauan Jennings missed two games due to injury and looked to be in pain in the 15 games that he played. Still caught 55 passes for 643 yards and nine touchdowns.

576: Turf toe limited Purdy to 51.3 percent of the season snaps in nine starts. Mac Jones had 546 snaps and 48.7.

554: Tight end George Kittle missed six games with hamstring and ankle issues and his snap count was the lowest since 2020 when he had 443.

449: The combined number of season snaps for Warner (330, broken ankle) and defensive end Nick Bosa (119, torn ACL).

385: Defensive end Mykel Williams, the No. 11 overall pick in the draft, had his season end after nine games with a torn ACL. He set a mean edge but is still awaiting his first NFL sack.

Cam Ward injury: What happened, and why did it happen?","JACKSONVILLE, FL ― Tennessee Titans interim coach Mike McCoy offered his first public statement on quarterback Cam Ward's shoulder injury following the season-ending loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Jan. 4.

""We'll do more testing,"" McCoy said. ""Until they do more testing, I'll give you a better answer down the road.""

According to a report from Jeff Howe of The Athletic, the initial belief is that Ward suffered a Grade 3 AC sprain in his throwing shoulder. One source with knowledge of the situation told The Tennessean that Ward's injury is thought to be a ""significant"" AC sprain.

Ward was spotted on the sideline during the second half sporting a sling across his right arm and shoulder. He was still wearing the sling when he exited the locker room to board the team bus. He did not speak to the media following the game, but teammates, including fellow quarterback Brandon Allen, indicated that Ward is in ""good spirits.""

Cam Ward timeline: What is a 'Grade 3 AC sprain' anyway?

Grade 3 is the highest degree of severity for a shoulder sprain. Surgery isn't often recommended, even for athletes, because rest and rehab can be effective, but that's less often the case with quarterbacks and other performers who have to use their shoulders for throwing.

In short, a Grade 3 sprain is differentiated from lesser sprains because of damage to the coracoclavicular ligament that could end up displacing the collarbone a little more severely. In the cases that surgery is recommended for a Grade 3 AC sprain, recovery time is expected to range from six to nine months.

Cam Ward injury: What happened, and why did it happen?

Ward injured his right throwing shoulder lunging toward the end zone on a touchdown rush in the first quarter. The Titans designed multiple QB runs for him on his first and only possession of the game, gaining yards both times. But the rookie quarterback, who up to that point hadn't missed a single offensive snap in 2025, landed awkwardly on the football and was crunched downward by an encroaching Jaguars defender, leading to Ward getting up slowly and eventually heading to the locker room for evaluation.

Plays like that had been rare for the Titans this season; Ward averaged fewer than one designed carry per game. But McCoy indicated that plays like that had been in the playbook; it was just a matter of deploying them in this game.

""You put plays in all year long, and we've had other plays like that during the season,"" McCoy said about the designed run play call.

Within the next 30 minutes, Ward was ruled out of the game. He was replaced by Allen, who struggled mightily. The Titans didn't score another point after Ward's injury, leading to an easy victory for the AFC South champion Jaguars.

Ward was the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft and started every game for the Titans. He set the franchise single-season record for passing yards by a rookie but ultimately led the team to a 3-14 record — the same record that earned the Titans their No. 1 pick used to select Ward.","https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/04/PNAS/88019868007-usatsi-27931569.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-05 18:00:19.312849

Weakside linebacker Dee Winters sustained an ankle injury on Saturday and played 29 of the 49ers’ 69 defensive plays.","The 49ers will turn to veteran middle linebacker Eric Kendricks as the team opens the NFL playoffs.

Tatum Bethune, who started eight games in place of injured Fred Warner, will miss the remainder of the season with a torn groin muscle, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said Monday on a conference call with Bay Area reporters.

The 49ers, the sixth seed in the NFC with a 12-5 record, open the NFL playoffs on Sunday at the third-seeded Philadelphia Eagles (11-6).

Left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (ankle, knee) will be evaluated throughout the week to determine if they will be available to play against the Eagles, Shanahan said. Both players were inactive for the 49ers' regular-season finale against the Seattle Seahawks.

It has yet to be determined whether Bethune will require surgery, Shanahan said. Bethune registered 94 tackles on the season after taking over for Warner, a four-time All-Pro selection. Warner could return from a fractured and dislocated right ankle if the 49ers advance deeper into the playoffs.

The 49ers signed Kendricks, 33, an 11-year NFL veteran, to their practice squad on Nov. 26. He will take Bethune’s spot on the 53-man roster for the postseason.

“I’m real confident in Eric,” Shanahan said. “He’s been here long enough. These games he’s gotten in in the last couple of weeks he’s done a good job of. I’m glad that we got him for this situation.”

Find the latest San Francisco 49ers news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California.

Kendricks has appeared in three games with the 49ers and made his first start with the team on Saturday night in the team’s loss to the Seahawks. Kendricks entered this season with a streak of nine consecutive seasons with 100 or more tackles. He had four tackles against Seattle.

Weakside linebacker Dee Winters sustained an ankle injury on Saturday and played 29 of the 49ers’ 69 defensive plays. He will be evaluated throughout the week to determine his status for Sunday’s game, Shanahan said. Winters leads the 49ers with 101 tackles on the season.

The top backups for Winters are Garret Wallow and Curtis Robinson.

Another linebacker, Luke Gifford, also is battling a quadriceps injury and his status is uncertain, too. Gifford was chosen to the NFC Pro Bowl team as a special-teams player.

Defensive lineman Keion White also will be evaluated this week due to a hamstring injury.

The Broncos and Seahawks get the coveted bye week to rest and try and get as healthy as possible. 12 other teams are still playing this week, so let’s search for the injury news we need to watch.

Ricky Pearsall, WR, San Francisco 49ers

Trent Williams, T, San Francisco 49ers

The 49ers got handled by the Seahawks Saturday night, only scoring 3 points. They were missing receiver Ricky Pearsall, although Pearsall has been a mainstay on the injury report this season. The bigger issue is tackle Trent Williams, especially headed into Philadelphia. For their flaws, Philly’s defense is ferocious. Going on the road against a strong pass rush is not where you want to be without your left tackle. The status of Williams is one of the more important injuries heading into Wild Card weekend, as far as we know. Since 2020, the 49ers are 4-13 without Williams and have averaged 19.8 points per game. There is other context in that sample but that is a stark difference considering they average 26.2 points per game in the 93 games with Williams in that same timespan.

Davante Adams, WR, Los Angeles Rams

The Rams have mostly survived without Davante Adams in the lineup for the past three games, but now there is no next week. Adams has been dealing with a hamstring injury, and he did log some limited practice reps this past week. There was some thought that he may have been back against the Cardinals, but the Rams sat him out once more. Getting him back for the playoffs would be a huge plus for the whole offense, especially since they will be on the road against Carolina. Los Angeles will be looking for revenge for a loss to the Panthers in Week 13.

Lane Johnson, T, Philadelphia Eagles

Jalen Carter, DL, Philadelphia Eagles

It’s been a challenging year for Lane Johnson — he’s been in and out of the lineup. That’s a vital piece to the Philadelphia offensive line, and the Eagles think he should be back for this week. One of the weakest spots for the 49ers is the defense. They’ve dealt with injuries to every level of the defense and are still missing some of their best defensive playmakers in Fred Warner and Nick Bosa. Philly should also get good news on the defensive side, as Jalen Carter is fully expected to play. He played against the Bills in Week 17, so Week 18 appears to be just a rest day. Especially with Trent Williams coming into this week as a question mark, Carter can help the Philly defense potentially dictate this matchup.

Landeskog did not finish a 2-1 loss to the Florida Panthers at Amerant Bank Arena after crashing into a goalpost during the second period. Unable to skate under his own power, Landeskog was helped to the dressing room by Avalanche medical personnel.

“Upper body, he’s going to miss some time,” Bednar said after the game in Sunrise, Fla. “He’s still getting looked at and diagnosed. Did not look comfortable.”

Landeskog’s left skate blade appeared to catch on the ice while he attempted to split two Panthers defending skaters and charge toward the goal. Upon falling, he slid into the near post, crashing into it with his left mid torso at 18:38 of the second period. He remained on the ice for over a minute.

""I don't know that for sure,"" Ward responded when asked about potential surgery. ""If that's the case we're going to do what I need to do, but I don't think that's the case right now.""

Ward said ""there is relief"" when asked about early examinations on the shoulder while saying he's willing to do whatever is asked of him by the training staff.

""They're going to get it right,"" Ward said of his shoulder. ""(And) continue to walk me through the process to what I need to do to get better, and get back on the field.

Ward, who started all 17 games for the Titans in 2025, played every snap before suffering the right shoulder injury in the first quarter in Sunday's season finale at the Jaguars.

Ward finished the season completing 323-of-540 passes for 3,169 yards, 15 touchdowns and seven interceptions, with a passer rating of 80.3. Ward also rushed for 159 yards and two touchdowns.

On 540 passing attempts in 2025, Ward threw seven interceptions. His 1.3 interception percentage stands as the best single-season mark in franchise history by all qualifying quarterbacks. He broke Ryan Tannehill's franchise record of 1.5 percent in 2020. Over the final nine games of the season, Ward threw only one interception.

Ward's 540 attempts in 2025 were more than every quarterback in franchise history in a season other than Warren Moon, who had 655 attempts in 1991 and 584 attempts in 1990.

Rams head coach Sean McVay put those worries to rest Monday, however, announcing Adams is expected to face the Panthers on Saturday.

McVay admitted Adams probably could have returned to action in Week 18, but the team took a cautious approach with the 33-year-old wideout, per ESPN.

McVay said the Rams ""erred on the side of caution"" with Adams' return, and that it ""pissed him off pretty good because of the competitor that he is.""

""But he's got that look in his eye that I know he's ready to go,"" McVay said. ""And man, you just feel better when you see No. 17 out there on our offense, and it poses a lot of different challenges for people to have to defend when you put that freaking stud back out on the grass for us.""

NFL insider Jay Glazer issued a similar report prior to Sunday's game, saying Adams was pushing to play against the Cardinals, but was shut down by McVay. The Rams didn't need Adams to pick up a win in the contest, though. After overcoming a slow start, the Rams' offense broke out to score 37 points in a 17-point win over the Arizona Cardinals. That was likely exactly what McVay wanted to see after he announced he would play his starters in Week 18.

Adams was a revelation in his first season with the Rams. While the veteran posted his lowest yardage total since 2015, he made up for it with 14 scores. He proved to be the perfect complement to Puka Nacua and was a driving factor behind Stafford contending for the MVP award.

Tight end Terrance Ferguson is also expected to play Saturday after missing the regular season finale because of a hamstring injury.

Meanwhile, offensive lineman Kevin Dotson's status for Saturday is still to be determined.

""The anticipation is getting Quentin Lake back, getting Davante Adams back, and then we'll see what it looks like for Kevin Dotson as well,"" McVay said.

Returning this weekend aligns with what McVay has previously said regarding the expected timeline for Lake, who missed the team's final seven regular season games due to an elbow injury sustained against the Seahawks in Week 11.

Adams re-aggravated a hamstring injury two weeks later that sidelined him for the team's final five regular season games, but McVay said they've been erring on the side of caution with the receiver.

McVay said Ferguson being inactive in Week 18 was a precautionary decision made by the team because of a short turnaround coming off a Monday night game last week. He ""had accumulated a bunch of volume,"" McVay said, then ""kind of felt"" his hamstring Friday. While Ferguson played only 32 of the team's 65 offensive snaps (49.2%) in Week 17 against the Falcons, he played 76.1% of the team's offensive snaps in Week 16 against the Seahawks, 77.8% in Week 15 against the Lions and 64.3% in Week 14 against the Cardinals, all of which marked his three-highest amounts of playing time in the regular season.

""And he's obviously a special player for us and the way that we use him,"" McVay said. ""Felt it on Friday. Came in Saturday, and there wasn't optimism, in terms of, there was a possibility we could set him back, especially just knowing what we had ahead this week, and so erred on the side of caution with him. It worked out, because getting (tight end Tyler) Higbee back didn't leave us so short-handed at that position. And obviously, Higs played a lot more snaps than we had kind of planned, but he's a total stud, and did an excellent job, and we needed everything that he brought yesterday. But I do think we'll get Terrance back.""

Ward said he will need to make an expeditious decision so the Colts can move forward with their roster-building.","INDIANAPOLIS -- Colts cornerback Charvarius Ward, battling complications from a series of three concussions in 2025, is seriously considering retirement from the NFL, he said Monday.

Ward, who finished the season on injured reserve after his latest concussion three weeks ago, said he has been unable to shake lingering symptoms and will prioritize his future health as he processes his decision.

""With the brain injuries, you don't really see it ... until you get older sometimes,"" said Ward, who is 29 and just finished the first season of a three-year, $54 million contract with the Colts.

""I'm still a pretty young guy and the more I beat my brain up, the more it'll affect me as I get older. So, I've got a lot of life to live out of football. I've got to think about my family and kids, too. So, we'll see.""

Ward's second concussion, which occurred in a collision with tight end Drew Ogletree during pregame warmups, landed him on injured reserve and resulted in severe symptoms that lasted for weeks.

He said upon his return that he worried during his absence whether he'd be able to continue playing. But Ward finally gained clearance and returned to the lineup against the Kansas City Chiefs on Nov. 23. Two weeks later, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ward suffered another concussion and is still dealing with its aftermath.

""It's going to be something to think about because I did hit my head a few days ago and I got a crazy headache,"" he said. ""So, I mean, we'll just see how it goes. I'm not trying to be dealing with migraines and headaches.""

If Ward decides to come back, he would hope to make a bigger impact. Ward was a solid addition in the games he played, often shadowing opponents' top receivers. The midseason trade for two-time All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner raised hopes that the Colts could field an elite secondary. Gardner has also dealt with injuries since his arrival and the full unit rarely played together.

But if Ward returns, he knows his own potential and that of the full unit.

""I'm definitely motivated to be the best I can be for next season,"" he said.

As for his concussion issues, Ward suggested they surprised him because he can only recall one previous concussion diagnosis in his career.

""So this was kind of an unlucky thing when I ran into [Ogletree],"" Ward said.

Of particular importance for Ward is being available for his family. Ward's 1-year-old daughter died after battling heart problems in October 2024 and Ward has struggled with his emotions since. He and his fiancée have a young son and Ward has yearned to be home in Texas with the family more often. Additionally, Ward said his father has already advised him he should retire.

""If I walk away, I feel like I'd be happy,"" he said. ""I'd have won the Super Bowl [with Kansas City] ... made hella money, made the Pro Bowl, made All-Pro. I did everything I wanted to. So, I feel like if I walk away, I won't regret it. I'm good.""

Ward said he will need to make an expeditious decision so the Colts can move forward with their roster-building. He is due a $7.98 million roster bonus in March.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0105%2Fr1596969_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 15:00:20.844374

On Sunday, though, Dobbins was in sweats and in the flesh on a sunny day in Denver, adding to growing optimism that the Broncos might indeed get their No. 1 RB back depending on how long the Broncos’ playoff run can last.

During early warm-ups for the Broncos-Chargers game, Dobbins spent over 30 minutes catching up with former Los Angeles teammates and coaches, darting over to the stands to sign a few autographs. The running back wasn’t wearing any sort of boot or brace on his foot, a notable sign in his recovery from a Lisfranc injury suffered in early November against the Las Vegas Raiders.

Broncos vs. Chargers: Live updates and highlights from the NFL Week 18 game

Originally, Dobbins was pinpointed for a potential return in February's Super Bowl, if Denver advanced that far. But the running back has been telling people inside the Broncos' building that he'll return beforehand, an ambitious but not-impossible timeline.

“It wouldn’t be soon, but that has a chance to happen,” Payton said in late November of a potential Dobbins return this season.

Even if the veteran back wasn't fully conditioned upon his return, his availability could provide a major boost to a Broncos ground game that hasn't operated nearly as efficiently since his foot injury. Denver's offense averaged 4.8 yards per carry in 10 games with Dobbins healthy; since, they're down to 4.0. Rookie running back RJ Harvey entered Sunday 14th in the NFL in touchdowns, but has displayed inconsistent vision in a bell-cow role.

Franklin-Myers inactive: The Broncos were missing a key piece of their defensive line Sunday, as starting defensive end John Franklin-Myers was inactive for the first time this season in Week 18 against the Chargers. Franklin-Myers has been limited all week with a hip issue, and was limited to just 11 snaps in Week 17 against the Chiefs.

That brings his 2025 regular season to a close, with a career-best 7.5 sacks in 16 games. He'll enter the playoffs as the lone starting member of this Broncos defensive line who isn't locked up for the forthcoming future, and Franklin-Myers is in line for a monster raise on his current two-year, $15 million deal come free agency.

In Franklin-Myers' stead, third-round pick Sai'vion Jones was activated for just the third time in his rookie season, while reserve Eyioma Uwazurike started the first game of his four-year NFL career.

Chargers sit seven starters: Los Angeles head coach Jim Harbaugh didn't attempt any shred of gamesmanship this week, announcing right away Monday that the Chargers would sit star quarterback Justin Herbert against the Broncos. And with Los Angeles essentially punting in Week 18 with little stakes to play for, the club trotted out wide swaths of its B-team -- and C-team -- against Denver Sunday.

The Chargers' inactive report included six more starters scratched -- running back Omarion Hampton, defensive backs Derwin James and Elijah Molden, outside linebacker Tuli Tuipulotu, and offensive linemen Jamaree Salyer and Bradley Bozeman -- in addition to Herbert.

Landry, 29, has been dealing with his knee injury throughout the season, but played in every game of the regular season but the final two. Anfernee Jennings and Elijah Ponder have primarily filled in for the veteran, whose return feels the likeliest.

Spillane, 30, has not appeared in a game since Week 13, seemingly suffering his injury just before the bye week and didn’t play despite being active during his club’s Week 15 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Spillane eventually returned to practice this week but was not made active for the regular season finale, and has been replaced primarily by Jack Gibbens.

Tonga, 29, hasn’t played in two weeks, though the club has gotten decent production from youngsters Cory Durden, Eric Gregory and practice squadder Leonard Taylor III. Milton Williams also returned from injured reserve in Week 18.

Wilson, 22, has been in concussion protocol for the last two weeks. Ben Brown has started four games this season in his place, and performed admirably enough to earn a two-year contract extension.

T.J. Watt tied Strahan's record in 2021, technically a 17-game season, but did so in just 15 games played that year (he missed two games due to injury). Steelers opponents had 557 pass plays in the games Watt played that season.

Garrett recorded his 23rd sack of the season in his 17th game played. Browns opponents had 540 pass plays in 2025.

So for those counting at home:

Strahan: 22.5 sacks in 567 pass plays

Watt: 22.5 sacks in 557 pass plays

Garrett: 23.0 sacks in 540 pass plays

While it is true that all counting stat ""records"" are in danger of being broken in the 17-game season era and beyond, that does not mean they should all have an asterisk next to them. Especially this one.

Enjoy your 23-sack-record and new partnership with Jordan Brand, Myles.

Although the Browns were eliminated from playoff contention five weeks ago, 2025 should give Browns fans some hope for the future. Shedeur Sanders showed promise, Quinshon Judkins scored seven touchdowns in just 14 games, Harold Fannin Jr. set franchise records for a rookie tight end and Carson Schwesinger led all NFL rookies in tackles.

To wrap that all up into some neat context: the 2025 Browns are the only team since the 1970 merger to have a rookie lead them in pass yards (Sanders), rush yards (Judkins), receiving yards (Fannin Jr.) and tackles (Schwesinger) in a season.

Speaking of Schwesinger, if he wins Defensive Rookie of the Year and Garrett takes home the Defensive Player of the Year award as expected, the 2025 Browns would be the fourth team to have both the defensive player and rookie of the year in the same season, joining: the 2013 Ravens (Ray Lewis and Terrell Suggs), the 1981 Giants (Lawrence Taylor and … Lawrence Taylor) and the 1974 Steelers (Mean Joe Greene and Jack Lambert).

2) Lawrence showcases his dual-threat ability

The first overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft is heading into the playoffs on an unbelievable heater. In his last eight games, Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence has:

An 8-0 record

19 passing touchdowns

5 rushing touchdowns

Led the Jaguars to the No. 1 offense in football (33.6 points per game in that stretch).

Lawrence is just the third player in NFL history with 19 passing touchdowns and five rushing touchdowns in any eight-game span within a season, joining Lamar Jackson in his 2019 MVP campaign and Cam Newton in his 2015 MVP campaign. His 38 total touchdowns in 2025 are the most by any player in a season in Jaguars history.

The Jaguars finished with as many wins in 2025 (13) as they had in 2023 and 2024 combined and Liam Coen became just the seventh first-time head coach in league history to win 13 games, joining Kevin O'Connell (2022), Matt LaFleur (2019), Jim Harbaugh (2011), Jim Caldwell (2009), Steve Mariucci (1997) and George Seifert (1989).

But it was not just the coach and quarterback that made history for the Jaguars this season -- as kicker Cam Little added a 67-yard field goal in Week 18 to the record books, the second-longest field goal in NFL history behind his own mark of 68 set in Week 9 against the Las Vegas Raiders. Little is the only kicker in the Super Bowl era to simultaneously hold the records for the longest and second-longest made field goals of all-time.

3) Stafford makes strong case for MVP

Despite falling out of the race for the NFC West and No. 1 seed in the conference, Matthew Stafford has remained firmly at the top of the MVP conversation with his prolific passing numbers this season. At 37 years old, Stafford finished his 2025 season with 46 touchdowns and 4,707 passing yards, both the most in the NFL. His Rams had the highest-scoring offense in the league at 30.5 points per game. Here is some MVP precedence for those facts:

The only players to outright lead the NFL in pass yards and touchdowns while playing for the top scoring offense in the NFL since 1990 are Stafford in 2025 and five quarterbacks who all won MVP that season (Patrick Mahomes in 2022, Peyton Manning in 2013, Tom Brady in 2007 and Kurt Warner in 2001).

To make that list a little more exclusive, here are the only players in NFL history to lead the NFL in pass yards and touchdowns while throwing eight or fewer interceptions: Stafford in 2025 and Brady in 2007.

In Week 18 against the Cardinals, it may have been the deciding factor in Stafford's MVP case, as he threw four more touchdowns and avoided turning the ball over. It was the ninth game this season in which he threw at least three touchdowns and avoided throwing an interception, one fewer game than Aaron Rodgers' record 10 such performances in his 2020 season (which also ended in an MVP).

To be fair to the Drake Maye fans on the other side of the MVP argument, Stafford does not have an impenetrable résumé -- his team finished 12-5 and will have to go on the road in the Wild Card Round. The last time a player won MVP on a team that was not a top-two seed in his conference (let alone on a team that failed to win their division) was Adrian Peterson in 2012. The last time a quarterback on a wild-card team won MVP was Manning in 2008.

4) JSN sets Seahawks receiving yards record

Jaxon Smith-Njigba demolished Seattle's single-season record for receiving yards (1,303 by DK Metcalf in 2020) en route to becoming the first Seahawks player since Hall of Famer Steve Largent to lead the NFL in receiving yards.

Smith-Njigba finished 2025 with 1,793 receiving yards, the second-most by a player in a season before his 24th birthday all-time. JSN was just 16 yards short of that record held by Justin Jefferson (1,809 yards in 2022).

In 15 of his 17 games played in 2025, Smith-Njigba had at least 75 receiving yards, the second-most games of that ilk in a season in NFL history. Only his current teammate Cooper Kupp had more (16 such games in 2021 with the Rams).

Maybe most impressive part of it all: Smith-Njigba did this while playing for one of the most run-heavy offenses in the NFL. The Seahawks ran the ball on 50 percent of their offensive plays in 2025, the third-highest rate behind the Ravens and Bills. Smith-Njigba is the first player in the Super Bowl era to lead the NFL in receiving yards while playing for a team that passed at a bottom-three rate in the NFL.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/sigtajftzwb07aupubma,N,,2026-01-05 17:01:06.081628

With three documented concussions this season, Ward has every reason to consider life beyond the game through a reflective lens about what's most important to him in the long run.
On Monday morning, Ward was asked about his season and the considerations he's making at this stage of his NFL career.
After eight NFL seasons, Ward is set financially and even made the Pro Bowl in 2023 when he led the NFL with 23 pass deflections.
At this point, Ward is uncertain whether or not he will retire or return.","Charvarius Ward has spent the last several years putting together one of the most remarkable playing careers for anyone who entered the league as an undrafted prospect. Following Week 18, the veteran cornerback admitted the NFL chapter of his story might be coming to an end.

One year ago, Ward was an exciting new addition to the Indianapolis Colts' secondary. After signing a lucrative deal in free agency, the Colts were leaning on Ward to anchor a new-look defensive backfield that would also eventually add Sauce Gardner to the mix after a blockbuster midseason trade. Together with Kenny Moore, Indy' pass coverage looked like the envy of the league—at least on paper.

Unfortunately for Ward, thw 2025 turned out to be one disastrous physical turn after another. With three documented concussions this season, Ward has every reason to consider life beyond the game through a reflective lens about what's most important to him in the long run.

The veteran cornerback says everything is on the table at this point, including returning to the game for a ninth season or walking away from it all.

On Monday morning, Ward was asked about his season and the considerations he's making at this stage of his NFL career. He was open about the possibility of walking away from it all and said his father is already asking him to retire.

""My daddy told me to retire, but I don't know, I don't think I'm gonna do it,"" said Ward. ""I just gotta see how I feel this offseason. I know going into next season, if I do come back and play again, if I get one more, I'll for sure probably retire if I get one more concussion. But hopefully, knock on wood, I don't get no more concussions. I don't have to deal with that anymore. But it was crazy, though, just dealing with all those headaches offseason. It's a painful, frustrating thing. Hopefully, I don't have to go through that again.""

The Kansas City Chiefs were the first team to give Ward a chance to play meaningful reps. Acquired from the Dallas Cowboys in a preseason trade before the 2018 season for offensive lineman Parker Ehinger, Ward played in 56 regular-season games over four seasons in K.C. and became well-respected defender in the process. That earned him a $42 million free-agent deal with the San Francisco 49ers.

Ward also admitted that his decision is not only his to make. He's got a family to consider as well. ""With the brain injuries, you don't really see it until you get older sometimes. I'm still a pretty young guy, and the more I beat my brain up, the more it'll affect me as I get older. So I mean, I got a lot of life to live out of football. I got to think about my family and kids, too.""

After eight NFL seasons, Ward is set financially and even made the Pro Bowl in 2023 when he led the NFL with 23 pass deflections. At this point, Ward is uncertain whether or not he will retire or return. But his explanation also revealed that the situation is tender at this point, with even offseason sensitivities that might make the decision clear.

""If I be working out, if I bump my head on something this offseason, hopefully I don't do that, and I get a headache from just something small like that,"" said Ward. ""I mean, it's gonna be something to think about, because I did hit my head a few days ago, and I got a crazy headache. So we'll just see how it goes. I'm not trying to deal with migraines and headaches for the rest of my life.","https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,x_1131,y_0,w_1787,h_1005/c_fill,w_1440,ar_1440:810,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/130/01ke7gt8sbvardwvxerm.jpg",N,,2026-01-05 13:00:16.304923

""There's several criteria that we're going to look for"" in the next head coach, Schoen said, among them leadership, football acumen, player development and communication. The Giants GM added that ""there a lot of potential head coaching candidates that are excited about the opportunity"" in New York because of players like Jaxson Dart and the roster in place.

Despite outside clamoring for Schoen's dismissal, ownership has backed the GM through a four-win season. Upon firing coach Brian Daboll, Mara said he believed Schoen had built a good core that could help build a winner.

In 2025, Big Blue drafted Dart and Abdul Carter in the first round and added Cam Skattebo in the third. Dart provided life to the franchise, Carter came on strong down the stretch, and Skattebo was a revelation before an injury waylaid his campaign. In 2024, Malik Nabers was a shining star before suffering a season-ending knee injury early this year. Even with those bright spots, there are plenty of holes Schoen must fill if New York is to have a quick turnaround.

The first step will be finding the right coach to turn around a franchise that finished in the basement of the NFC East the past two seasons.

Jordan Love was 2nd in EPA per play (+0.29) and dealt with injuries at every position around him.
Pickens was 3rd in EPA added (+88.7) and became infinitely more consistent with better QB play.
Ditto for the run game.
They can be beaten by speedy pass rushers, like Micah Parsons, in the pass game, but that's why they are right tackles.","This was a close two-player race with a clear efficiency leader and clear total volume leader. To me, the differences in their supporting casts and record were the tiebreakers. Drake Maye was 1st in EPA per play (still on top-10 usage), and the Patriots' supporting cast is below average. Maye's processing took a big leap, as did his accuracy. He easily led in completion percentage over expected (+10.3) while delivering the most consistent deep ball of the year. As a side hustle, Maye was a red zone rushing weapon and an effective scrambler whenever needed. Perhaps most surprising and valuable was his ability to navigate a bad OL. When pressured, the Patriots had the 3rd-best EPA per play. That's the definition of individual value and separated him from my runner up, who was 12th in that same metric.

Matthew Stafford easily led in touchdown passes (46) and passing yards (4,707), while still ranking 4th in success rate and 5th in EPA per play to appease the fancy bois. Those scores, by the way, were the most in a season since Aaron Rodgers' 2020 when defenses were entirely structured differently. Stafford manipulated zone defenders with his eyes from within the pocket at a level I don't remember seeing before, and his arm strength is still high-end. Stafford benefited from having Sean McVay Puka Nacua, Davante Adams, a quadruple TE room, and the best rushing success rate team in decades, but he has as much freedom and say in the offense as anyone in the league. There's no way to properly defend Stafford at this point. The Rams were 1st against man coverage, 2nd against zone coverage, and 1st against the blitz.

Josh Allen doesn't have an efficiency or head-to-head case against Maye nor a total volume case against Stafford, but he still played like an MVP for most of the season. I'd also argue in unideal circumstances. The Bills wide receiver room was amongst the very worst in the NFL, and their ground game, while very good, is partially tied to his legs. Amongst playoff teams, the Bills were as reliant on super-hero plays from their QB as anyone. Allen still finished 4th in EPA per play and dragged an injured defense to a 12-5 record.

Myles Garrett is an unconventional MVP vote in the modern era, but he broke a record and did it honorably. His sacks per team pass attempt face was the best of all time, and the Browns don't have an elite counterpart to take pressure off. There weren't standout QB options beyond the top-3 this year, so let's reward true greatness.

Jordan Love was 2nd in EPA per play (+0.29) and dealt with injuries at every position around him. He didn't have Christian Watson or Jayden Reed early, then lost Tucker Kraft, then lost C Elgton Jenkins and RT Zach Tom. The OL only was 29th in pressure rate allowed per PFF, and he handled it nearly perfectly. Love got out of trouble by throwing it over the top and quietly buying time in the pocket with subtle pocket movement. He went 9-4-1 in his healthy games, providing Green Bay with the most EPA per dropback through 15 weeks when they clinched the playoffs.

To me, the definition is the best offensive player removing all QBs. They should formally make that switch, as it should be nearly impossible to win MVP as a non-QB if you're voting properly.

Puka Nacua easily led non-QBs in EPA added (+125.4) and success rate (70%). If not for some Davante Adams goal-line scores, that could've even been better. Adams missed a few games late, and Nacua immediately stepped up with 12-225-2, 5-57-1, and 10-76-1 receiving lines. His highlight grabs with one hand or near the sideline were the best in the NFL, and he is one of the most willing targets over the middle and blockers in the ground game as a side hustle. Nacua's 115 total yards per game puts him on all-time lists.

Jaxon Smith-Njigba was 2nd in EPA added (+90.7) and did so by adding downfield ability to his bag in a new offense. His 3.4 yards per route is one of the very best since the stat was created, too. George Pickens wasn't far behind, even if his target numbers weren't quite as high. Pickens was 3rd in EPA added (+88.7) and became infinitely more consistent with better QB play. In fact, the impending free agent was 4th in success rate (64%) among WRs with 50+ targets.

Discussing the NFL all-time sack leader is a waste of time, especially when Myles Garrett was also double- or triple-teamed on 65% of his pass rushes (3rd highest).

Micah Parsons finished with 12.5 sacks in about 12.5 games if we factor in his missed time with a torn ACL and the first couple games directly after the Packers' trade. His per-play impact is only matched by Myles Garrett, and without him, the Packers could've missed the playoffs. ESPN had Parsons 2nd in pass-rush win rate, while PFF graded him with a league-high 69% double- or triple-team rate.

Will Anderson had 12.0 sacks, but his impact is better felt with the advance data. Offenses chipped him at the 3rd-highest rate (24%), and he still was 4th in ESPN's pass-rush win rate. The Texans don't do a lot to scheme him into clean looks either, so Anderson is just winning by being a dog. He's also one of the most impactful super star pass rushers as a run defender, which helped the Texans finish 1st in points allowed.

This was a very down year for the award, but Tetairoa McMillan squeaks by after eclipsing 1,000 receiving yards on a ""playoff team"" as the very clear best skill player on the team. McMillan was the WR20 in receiving yards per game (59.6) and the WR28 in EPA added (+25.8) despite up-and-down QB play as the X receiver. The rookie showcased enough speed to run away from DBs after the catch and threaten vertically. That was the lone question on his otherwise high-floor prospect profile. His upside is similar to Drake London's, and he will be a top-50 pick in fantasy football drafts once again.

Jaxson Dart was nearly my rookie of the year. It was truly that close, even if the Giants record hides what Dart was offering on a per-play basis. He was the QB12 in EPA per play (+0.13) behind an average OL with a underwhelming skill group, as Dart only had 13 dropbacks with Malik Nabers throughout the year. Dart has the physical traits to eventually flirt with top-10 status. He can and wants to push the ball downfield as a passer, can throw with all arm angles, and then is a quality rusher as a scrambler and rusher (when they allow it). In fact, Dart led all QBs in total rushing EPA this year, just edging out Josh Allen. Dart obviously has room to improve with his decision making (see the Brian Flores game), but finishing above Lamar Jackson, Justin Herbert, Trevor Lawrence, Baker Mayfield, and Jalen Hurts in EPA per play as a rookie is nothing short of promising. The Giants have the 5th and 37th overall picks to surround him with more.

Tyler Shough was 24th in EPA per play (+0.03) despite being a very bad OL without a lot of depth in the skill group. By the very end of the year, Shough was hooping by himself. His arm stood out within the first few games, as he can throw with velocity to the sideline and over the middle on backside digs. Shough's age legitimately played to his advantage because he made more full-field reads from within the pocket then almost any non-1st-round rookie of the decade. While he did show plenty of straight-line speed in college, it was shocking at how mobile he looked on the NFL field. He had multiple designed rushing explosives and scores in the red zone. The Saints will absolutely treat him as the clear-cut starter this offseason, and he'd easily fetch a first-half Round 1 pick if we re-drafted today.

They don't get nearly the attention, but Jets RT Armand Membou, Seahawks LG Grey Zabel, Saints LT Kelvin Banks, Cowboys RG Tyler Booker, and Patriots LT Will Campbell all looked like hits in the 1st round. Lions LG Tate Ratledge, Bears LT Ozzy Trapilo, and Texans RT Aireontae Ersery looked like eventual plus starters on Day 2, too.

2nd-round LB Carson Schwesinger made 156 tackles. Before his missed Week 18, that was the 5th most in the NFL. Among off-ball LBs, his 11 tackles for loss were 3rd-most, too. That was the biggest surprise. Schwesinger was strong against blockers and often shedded them to make solo tackles. What wasn't a surprise was his range in coverage. His instincts and eyes were amazing at UCLA, and that traveled to the pros, as he was the Browns' green dot leader in the huddle.

1st-round EDGE Abdul Carter started in a rotation, was suspended for drives multiple times in the middle of the year, and then really dominated in December. If this award was about who was going to be the best long term, Carter is the run-away leader. He ended up 4th in ESPN's Pass Rush Win Rate and ultimately played over 900 snaps with Kayvon Thibodeaux missing some time. Carter's spin move was nasty, and the Giants moved him inside to further copy-cat the Micah Parsons comparison. He was extremely unlucky to only have 4.0 sacks on 73 pressures and 22 QB hits, but offenses who faced him knew to get the ball out quickly or else. Carter was also a quality run defender for his size, only trailing Donovan Ezeiruaku in the draft class in tackles on runs with a negative EPA.

1st-round EDGE James Pearce Jr. racked up a draft-class high 10.5 sacks for the Falcons, who were bailed out by sending the current 13th overall pick away to trade up for the pass rusher. Pearce has great explosion and hustle, making him an excellent choice for outside speed rushes and inside stunts. He simply glides on film and then has plenty of pound-for-pound strength on the occasional bull rush. The Falcons were smart to know where his strengths were and knew to pull him where he couldn't hold up; the run. Pearce only had 6 tackles on runs with negative EPA (compared to Carter's 17), and he was often subbed out on 1st-and-10s when teams could run at him. If he's this effective as a pass rusher each year, who really cares? Pearce is definitely good.

By the way, Eagles 1st-round LB Jihaad Campbell absolutely deserves a shoutout here after some of the crazy plays he made in coverage. Same with Bucs CB Jacob Parrish, Chiefs CB Nohl Williams, EDGE Donovan Ezeiruaku, EDGE Nic Scourton, EDGE Jalon Walker, EDGE Josaiah Stewart, DT Derrick Harmon, DT Kenneth Grant, and DT Mason Graham. It's a good defensive class.

If you haven't heard former (or current) interior offensive linemen talk about what it takes to play offensive tackle, it's worth trying to find clips. Centers can't believe what guards can do, and guards can't believe what tackles can do. To me, that makes ""Protector of the Year"" largely an OT award with an emphasis on the pass game as they ""protect"" the QB if you will.

Garrett Bolles is the leader of the No. 1 seed Broncos, protects Bo Nix's blindside, and is so rarely out of position. He wasn't credited with a single sack allowed this year, though the Broncos will protect their line with screens and boots off of play action. That said, Bolles is an absolute monster out in space because of his athleticism. He can bend, change direction, and close space with remarkable speed for the position. Ditto for the run game. When tasked with holding his spot in the normal dropback game, Bolles showed a lot of fight and recovery quickness, too. On top of that, Bolles played the most snaps amongst left tackles, something the other top left tackles in consideration can't say with Trent Williams, Laremy Tunsil, Andrew Thomas, and Tristan Wirfs all missing time.

It was a slight step down from Hall of Fame play, but Trent Williams turned out another great season in both phases. He was top-20 in Pass Rush Win Rate and 7th in Run Block Win Rate per ESPN's tracking, and the 49ers run behind him in ways most OTs can only dream about. Williams is the 49ers' enforcer in every way, and only the true elite pass rushers have the athleticism to move by him right now. A couple injuries and a tough outing with Myles Garrett break ties away from him winning an award that could be named after him.

It's a close battle between Penei Sewell and Darnell Wright for most hilarious run-block destroyers on the right side. Sewell gets the nod for being slightly more intimidating out in space, but this is the same profile. They have the power to throw guys out the club and hunt back seven players whenever they're pulled or have nobody in front of them on zone runs. They can be beaten by speedy pass rushers, like Micah Parsons, in the pass game, but that's why they are right tackles.

Others in consideration for me are Commanders LT Laremy Tunsil, Giants LT Andrew Thomas, Bucs LT Tristan Wirfs, Rams LT Alaric Jackson, Colts OG Quenton Nelson, Bears OG Joe Thuney, Titans OG Peter Skoronski, Broncos OG Quinn Meinerz, and Dolphins C Aaron Brewer.

First off, this reward deserves nearly zero seriousness. It's also an award that really should be split into two. There's a return from injury component, and then there's a breakout candidate component. It's hard to weigh one versus the other, and it'd be better if there was one of each.

The best blend of seriousness of injury and on-field impact was Aidan Hutchinson, who broke his damn leg in half last year. For a pass rusher who relies on power and bending corners, it was not a given that he'd return to the level he did in 2025. He racked up the most total pressures on the 4th-highest pressure rate according to PFF, leading to 14.5 sacks and the 3rd-most QB hits. Hutchinson was also chipped at the 4th-highest rate, too. Equally impressive to his production was his availability and workload. Hutchinson was the only edge rusher to reach 1,000 snaps this year.

A close second was Christian McCaffrey, who checked very similar boxes. He had a career-high 413 touches, leading to another 2,000-yard season. McCaffrey was the only Niner to stay healthy the entire year, and his route running was weaponized as the other receivers missed time. As usual, he danced around bad run blocking, too. The only things to nitpick versus Hutchinson is positional value and the seriousness of injury, as CMC didn't have surgery or miss the early offseason while in rehab. He was too busy winning all of us fantasy football championships instead.

Because it's an arbitrary award, the Philip Rivers experience was so wild to me that it deserves some recognition, just like Damar Hamlin deserved recognition after his experience (and he's received comeback votes in 3 separate seasons since his injury). Rivers hadn't played in 4.75 seasons and was a 44-year-old grandpa fresh off the couch. Given the stakes, the Colts were serious about this, and Rivers held his own. If he would've won a game, played the rest of the year, or by some miracle made the playoffs, Rivers absolutely would've been my 1st-place vote.

Others in consideration are Cowboys QB Dak Prescott, Steelers RT Troy Fautanu, Saints WR Chris Olave, Patriots WR Stefon Diggs, WR Christian Watson, and Giants LT Andrew Thomas.

The Seahawks only had a preseason team total of 8.5 wins. They finished with 14, in a loaded division, in a loaded conference. Mike MacDonald had three difficult decisions to make in the offseason, nailing all of them by hiring OC Klint Kubiak, upgrading with QB Sam Darnold, and trading away DK Metcalf. He deserves credit for some of that. More importantly, the Seahawks have a great culture in the building and their defense is arguably the best. MacDonald is the best defensive designer in football right now, as he minors in just about everything without a clear major in everything. His versatility makes him able to handle the Shanahan tree and the spread offenses. As a tie breaker, MacDonald's special teams was amongst the best in the NFL. Everything about the Seahawks is very professional right now.

If the 49ers win Week 18, they would've had the No. 1 seed and Kyle Shanahan walks away with the award, one he should be amongst the finalist for every single year. The Niners went 5-3 with Mac Jones, then 7-2 with Brock Purdy who he's developed into a real top-12 QB. His OL has Trent Williams and not a lot else, yet the ball moved at will without Brandon Aiyuk, Ricky Pearsall, and/or George Kittle. No excuses. Just finishing 3rd in offensive success rate. The 49ers being in the hunt for the top seed while the defense collapsed due to injury is another feather in Shanny's cap.

The Bears were 26th in EPA per play last year, added Ben Johnson (and a new OL and multiple skill guys), then finished 8th in EPA per play in 2025. That's coaching. Chicago created an identity with outside zone runs, especially after an early-season bye, and the Caleb Williams began settling in as he had more time to learn under Johnson. Perhaps most overlooked is how good the OL turned out despite having zero chemistry together. ESPN's Block Win Rate graded them 1st on pass plays and 6th on run plays. There's a lot of communication required to pull that off. Ultimately, the Bears won a division that entirely finished above .500, and the defense was only 20th in EPA per play.

Others in consideration were Liam Coen, Sean McVay, and Mike Vrabel.

The Patriots went from 27th to 1st in EPA per play in one year, with the same QB. Coach Mike Vrabel deserves plenty of credit for seeing the vision and making the hire, but OC Josh McDaniels was the leader and play caller of the offense. He got the most of rotations at WR, TE, and RB by only using each player to their strengths, and then he navigated an on-paper bottom-5 OL with great design. The Patriots leaned into their pass-game strengths at the end of the year, and McDaniels did a bit of everything in both phases. This all after taking a year off. Well done.

The most exciting defense every year is whichever one Brian Flores is coaching. Yet again, Flo dialed up the most blitzes. This year, it was by a magnitude of 175 more than the defense in 2nd. It sounds like a dangerous strategy, but the Vikings used smart safeties to navigate things in the secondary and often stayed in two-high coverages despite bringing an extra rusher. The complexity is a death sentence for any rookie QB or play caller, and that makes him a massive asset for the Vikings, who were 4th in EPA per play allowed. They do so without having any All Pro talent.

The Chargers aren't nearly as exciting on defense, but DC Jesse Minter is as sound and complex with his zone coverages as you'll see. Los Angeles was 2nd-lowest in their man coverage rate, rather living in the two-high zone world. In it, the Chargers had the best PFF coverage grade, allowing roaming back-seven players like Derwin James to use their instincts to their maximum. They ultimately finished 5th in EPA per play allowed even with EDGE Khalil Mack having an IR stint and after losing EDGE Joey Bosa and DT Poona Ford this offseason. All of the play callers ahead of him on defense have been head coaches before. Minter is likely next.",https://images.ctfassets.net/l8eoog2wur2i/3USg6a1I0DquMDjTPc1kdO/89042832502be3e55fee85121aa504ff/USATSI_27933849_168415901_lowres.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 14:00:20.633964

McCarthy and Jefferson looked more in sync Sunday than they did in the quarterback's first nine starts.","MINNEAPOLIS — It can sometimes be hard to accept, but beauty exists in the struggle.

J.J. McCarthy stood behind the lectern in the U.S. Bank Stadium depths Sunday afternoon, his face flush with emotions that matched up with his performance this season — namely confidence and uncertainty.

The finale of McCarthy's first year as a starter was never going to be as important as the ending of Harrison Smith's 14th season or the likely swan song of C.J. Ham's decade-long run as a homegrown Viking. But Week 18 of the 2025 slate was supposed to offer a good look at McCarthy's skills and his punctuation of a body of work in a roller-coaster campaign in which he won 60 percent of his 10 starts.

It's true, McCarthy had plenty of positive moments in the 16-3 win over Green Bay. It's also true that people outside the organization might overlook them and focus on another game impacted by injury.

After making a quick pass to Justin Jefferson in the third quarter, McCarthy let Head Coach Kevin O'Connell know he was experiencing difficulty in his throwing hand. Instead of trying to play through the pain and risk not gripping the football properly, he made a hand-off of the huddle to Max Brosmer.

""I feel like I had to make a grown-man decision,"" he emphasized in his postgame press conference.

Admittedly more aware of the game situation than he was two weeks ago when he ignored signs of the injury that prevented him from effectively clenching the football and stayed in the game at the Giants until a sack-fumble returned for a TD led him to the locker room, McCarthy sided with caution Sunday.

The 22-year-old considered it one of the toughest decisions of his life so far, but the correct one. Brosmer wound up replacing him and playing the final quarter-and-a-half of Minnesota's 9-8 campaign.

""I was happy I made the right decision,"" McCarthy said, harkening back to the Week 16 wisdom he gained. ""Feeling the momentum of the game and how well the defense is playing, when it gets to a point where you feel like your body is going to say, 'No, you can't do that,' you've got to put your ego aside.""

""I had to do what's best for the team,"" he added.

O'Connell appreciated the quarterback's mental and physical improvements.

""I think he's grown like a lot of young quarterbacks do,"" the coach assessed. ""And I'm excited about where he's ending the season and know that there's some things we can really dive into as a group, and J.J., myself. I look forward to the challenge of being the best version of myself"" for him and the team.

""He had some snaps where there was some real conviction to where he was going with the ball, finding the voids and vacancies, eliminating some things in rhythm, sometimes pre-snap, and then working his way through some coverages,"" O'Connell remarked. ""The only negative was really just the (taunting) penalty that kind of stalled us out. And that's just the competitor that he is. Appreciate everything about him as a competitor, but we just need to avoid ever setting ourselves back like that, especially post-snap.

""But the way he ran the show,"" O'Connell continued. ""Throughout the practice week, even though maybe early on he wasn't feeling 100 or so, he was able to work himself to a place where he absolutely wanted to go, and he took that preparation into the game, and I thought did a lot of good things today.""

McCarthy was sharp on the opening series, connecting with Jefferson for 18 yards after Jordan Mason got the ball rolling with a run for 13. The phenom receiver sprinted toward his sixth consecutive 1,000-yard season with 10 more on a shovel pass in the backfield, and then McCarthy charged out of the pocket, away from pressure, and scrambled for 6, tenaciously stiff-arming Packers linebacker Ty'Ron Hopper on his way to the sideline when he dropped his shoulder and blasted cornerback Keisean Nixon.

It was an awesome display of athleticism and toughness, except McCarthy lost control and barked in Nixon's face afterward. He was flagged for taunting, and Minnesota was pushed back to Green Bay's 38.

That flag reversed momentum — McCarthy called it ""selfish"" and said he got ""carried away"" after thwarting a tackler in that manner for the first time in his career and ""felt so bad"" because he knew he let his teammates down — and the Vikings eventually opted for a 43-yard field goal by Will Reichard.

Unfortunately, McCarthy's inaccuracies stagnated the offense on its next three opportunities.

First, on a possession that began at the Vikings 2, McCarthy targeted Jordan Addison near the right sideline but was too high with his aim, causing the receiver to elevate and bring him down several yards short of the sticks. On the subsequent snap, Mason was stuffed for no gain — and Minnesota punted.

The following drive featured a 12-yard delivery to ""Jets."" But soon after, McCarthy was flushed to his right and tried for tight end Ben Sims on an intermediate route coming across the field. His pass wasn't particularly close, and two plays later Ty Chandler was tackled for a loss of 1, prompting another punt.

Likewise, McCarthy looked for Sims on the first play of the fourth series but didn't put it in a favorable spot; the ball deflected off Sims' hands, which were stretched out to make a spectacular grab, and it was nearly picked off in Vikings territory. Minnesota had to punt, again, after a short carry and incompletion.

It's worth pointing out McCarthy dealt with strong pass rushes on each of those inaccurate passes and he either withstood them, like on the out-breaker to Addison, or he used his legs to buy time and release the rock outside the tackle box. Hurried or not, though, his misses were a bummer because teammates appeared open. To McCarthy's credit, he avoided a sack on 11 pressured drop backs, per Next Gen Stats.

The fifth and sixth series better resembled the first in that McCarthy made a couple brilliant plays that helped him finish 13-for-22 passing (nine throws for first downs) with 174 yards in the initial two frames.

Starting with eight-and-a-half minutes to go in the half, McCarthy hit four passes in a row, the first one going to mammoth tight end Josh Oliver, who wowed the home crowd with a 22-yard catch-and-run. Then, McCarthy spun 17-yarders to Jefferson and Jalen Nailor. The former connection pushed the global star past the 1,000-yard benchmark for the sixth consecutive season and linked him to Vikings Legend Randy Moss and current Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans as the only players in NFL history to begin their careers with that many. The one to Nailor was a strike over the middle that required great anticipation.

Moments later, McCarthy went back to Nailor, but ""Speedy"" was stopped just shy of the line to gain. McCarthy achieved it with a sneak on the ensuing snap, and then Mason pranced around the right side for 13 and a first-and-goal. From there, inaccuracy crept back into the developing quarterback's play.

McCarthy overthrew Addison in the end zone; then he threw the ball at Chandler's feet on an interrupted screen; and he missed Jefferson on an out-breaker to the right, which led to Reichard acing a chip-shot field goal for a 6-0 advantage. It was the kind of outstanding-and-not-so sequence of events that shadowed McCarthy for pretty much the duration of his first season leading the offensive huddle.

Minnesota and McCarthy got one more shot before the intermission, assuming possession at the 1:47 mark — and made the absolute most of it. In succession, Jefferson got 3 on an end-around, Oliver caught a 7-yard pass (but unfortunately picked up an ankle injury and left the game), Chandler nabbed one for 2, McCarthy couldn't link up with Jefferson, and then on third-and-8 with 54 seconds remaining, he waited patiently and let Nailor peel open; McCarthy placed it on the money for a tremendous gain of 26.

McCarthy executed perhaps his best throw of the game in an awfully clutch moment, threading one to Sims, who secured a tight-window pass racing out of bounds at Green Bay's 3 with 42 seconds on the clock. One play and a timeout later, the beloved fullback Ham inspired his hometown fans with a 1-yard TD run.

""That was just something where I've been working so hard and so vigorously and trying so hard to make those throws on the run,"" McCarthy said regarding his laser beam to Sims, one of his favorite flicks of the game. ""You've just got to kind of trust the spot and put it there, and I feel like I did a good job with that.""

Ultimately, McCarthy did what he's done consistently over his first 10 career games: battled adversity, created beautiful moments, persevered through pain, risen to the moment, and left a lot to be desired.

His lone pass in the second half — his 14th completion and 23rd attempt of the game and his 140th and 243rd of the season — went for 8 yards to Jefferson, who managed to top 100 for the first time since the Week 5 game in London when he posted 123 (eight catches for 101 yards). Immediately after, McCarthy motioned to the sideline, knowing he couldn't grip and rip it the way he needed to support the offense.

Although his exit was less than ideal, there was an element of comfort to his performance and how everything unfolded. McCarthy and Jefferson looked more in sync Sunday than they did in the quarterback's first nine starts. And McCarthy's willingness to prioritize his future over his pain tolerance — at the expense, maybe, of an offseason of unwanted narratives — confirmed his real-time maturation.

His handling of it added context to his comments on Wednesday this week — that trying times have formed a ""beautiful picture"" and ""beautiful story."" The meaning and reasoning of it, he elaborated, were in focus. McCarthy's mentality after the game highlighted that he's come a long way in six short months.

""Narratives are something completely out of your control. I can't change [them] no matter what I do. I can go out there, grind through it, and maybe fourth quarter happens, something fluke, and I screw up a lot of my offseason [goals],"" McCarthy said. ""But at the end of the day, you can't deal in those what-ifs.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/btjqpes7v6rqno928now,N,,2026-01-05 17:01:22.204521

Updated Jan. 4, 2026, 4:29 p.m. ET

The Cincinnati Bengals finished the 2025 NFL season with a 6-11 record after a 20-18 loss against the Cleveland Browns at Paycor Stadium in NFL Week 18.

After starting quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a turf toe injury during a Week 2 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Bengals lost eight of their next nine games to fall out of playoff contention.

The Bengals are expected to have more than $69 million in cap space, per overthecap.com, with about $53M in effective cap space and $4.7M in dead money.

The cap-space figure is the eighth-highest among NFL teams.

The contracts of the following players expire at the conclusion of the 2025 season, making them unrestricted free agents (with the exception of quarterback Jake Browning, who will be a restricted free agent):

Bengals players eligible for free agency (per Spotrac)

DE Trey Hendrickson

Age: 31

2025 performance: After Hendrickson agreed in August to a revised deal for the 2025 season that included a $14-million raise, the 2024 NFL sacks leader played in just seven games and recorded four sacks. Hendrickson aggravated a hip injury on a late block from behind by Jets offensive lineman John Simpson during the team's NFL Week 8 loss and missed the rest of the season.

DE Joseph Ossai

Age: 25

2025 performance: In March, the Bengals brought Ossai back on a one-year deal worth $7 million. Ossai had five sacks in the 14 games in which he played. He suffered a right shin injury during the team's NFL Week 14 loss at Buffalo.

S Geno Stone

Age: 26

2025 performance: Stone drew criticism for missed tackles during his second season with the Bengals. He had a 33-yard interception return for a touchdown during the team's NFL Week 12 loss to New England at Paycor Stadium.

QB Joe Flacco

Age: 40

2025 performance: Flacco, who turns 41 on Jan. 16, was 1-5 in his six starts during Burrow's recovery, but endeared himself to Bengals' fans and played through the pain of a sprained AC joint he suffered during the fourth quarter of the team's Week 8 loss to the Jets. During a 47-42 loss to Chicago in Week 9, Flacco became the oldest quarterback in NFL history to pass for 470 yards in a game.

TE Noah Fant

Age: 28

2025 performance: Fant suffered a right ankle injury during the team's NFL Week 15 loss to Baltimore, and suffered a concussion during the team's Week 3 loss to Minnesota, but otherwise stayed healthy. Fant was one of three Bengals to fumble during an ugly first half against the Vikings. He had nine catches for 80 yards over Cincinnati's two games against Pittsburgh. It was one of three times this season a Fant fumble was returned for a touchdown.

G Cordell Volson

Age: 27

2025 performance: Volson, injured during training camp, missed the entire season.

G Lucas Patrick

Age: 32

2025 performance: Signed to a one-year deal in March, Patrick missed most of the season after hurting his calf during the second quarter of the team's season-opening Week 1 win against the Cleveland Browns.

DB Marco Wilson

Age: 26

2025 performance: Wilson saw limited action throughout the season. He was injured during training camp in July, and hurt again when he suffered a right hamstring injury during the team's NFL Week 12 loss to New England.

He started all 17 games, throwing for 15 touchdowns and seven interceptions.

Despite a strong finish, Ward ranked among the league's worst quarterbacks in several key statistical categories.

JACKSONVILLE ― Tennessee Titans rookie quarterback Cam Ward's season is over after he's been ruled out with a right shoulder injury in Week 18 against Jacksonville.

Ward ends his rookie season having started all 17 games, leading the team to three wins. He threw 15 touchdowns with seven interceptions and ran for two more touchdowns, including the one on which he injured his shoulder. He finishes his rookie season with 3,169 passing yards, a Titans franchise record among rookie passers.

After starting the season slow, Ward threw multiple touchdowns in each of his last four complete games, leading the Titans to wins over Cleveland and Kansas City during that stretch.

Looking at the season in totality, Ward finished among the league's worst quarterbacks statistically. He came into Week 18 ranked in the bottom three in the NFL in completion percentage, passer rating, yards per attempt and passing success rate.

The Titans drafted Ward with the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, trying to capture the magic Ward spun in his college stops at Incarnate Ward, Washington State and Miami. Ward left Miami as the NCAA Division I's all-time leader in touchdown passes.

Without Ward, the Titans will turn to Brandon Allen for the remainder of Sunday's game versus the Jaguars.

The Titans head into the offseason with a coaching search ranking as the top priority. The Titans fired Brian Callahan, the coach who drafted Ward and helped design the offense he'd run in his rookie year, back in October.","https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/04/PNAS/88019568007-usatsi-27931276.jpg?crop=3770,2121,x0,y196&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-05 11:14:59.629195

In his 12th and final start as a rookie, Jaxson Dart completed 22 of 32 passes for 230 yards and two touchdowns for a career-high 110.2 passer rating. He also ran five times for 32 yards.

Dart's highlight of the day was an impromptu backhand flip to tight end Daniel Bellinger, who caught it and weaved his way through defenders for a 29-yard touchdown to give the Giants a 16-10 halftime lead.

Not to be outdone, running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. scored on a 13-yard touchdown pass from Dart in the third quarter and fellow running back Devin Singletary added to the highlight reel with a successful two-point conversion pass to wide receiver Darius Slayton. Singletary took a direct snap, faked a handoff to Dart going the other way, and scrambled before finding Slayton in the end zone for a 24-10 lead.

Tracy recorded a career-high 159 yards from scrimmage on 18 carries for 103 yards and eight catches for 56 yards and the touchdown. A fifth-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, Tracy became the third Giant in franchise history with 1,000 scrimmage yards in each of his first two seasons, joining wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and running back Saquon Barkley.

Dart ends his rookie campaign with 24 total touchdowns, including a franchise-record nine rushing scores. The No. 25 overall draft pick trails only Charlie Conerly (27 in 1948) and Daniel Jones (26 in 2019) for the most total touchdowns in Giants history by a rookie quarterback.

Dart joined Eli Manning (2004) as the only rookie quarterbacks in franchise history to beat the Cowboys.

Singletary punched in his fifth rushing touchdown of the season, his most since also having five in 2022 with the Bills.

After reaching 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career, wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson was inactive for the season finale due to a rib injury. Robinson ends his fourth season with 92 catches for 1,014 and four touchdowns. His 92 catches are sixth-most in a single season in franchise history (his 93 catches from a year ago are fifth). Robinson and Odell Beckham Jr. are the only Giants ever to record multiple seasons with at least 90 catches.

Gunner Olszewski made his first start at wide receiver since 2022, when he was a member of the Steelers. He shattered his career highs on Sunday with eight catches for 103 yards. An accomplished return specialist, Olszewski had just 17 catches for 223 yards in his previous 80 career games (four starts).

Rookie Marcus Mbow started at left tackle for the second consecutive game with Andrew Thomas (hamstring) on injured reserve. The fifth-round pick from Purdue finishes his rookie campaign with three starts (including one in Week 9 at right tackle) in 13 games. Austin Schlottmann also lined up at center for John Michael Schmitz, who missed the last two games of the season with a finger injury.

WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE DEFENSE

Linebacker Bobby Okereke recorded a takeaway for the second consecutive week, recovering a botched snap by Dak Prescott on the Cowboys' opening drive. The Giants scored a field goal on the ensuing possession for the first points of the game. Okereke picked off Geno Smith last week for the linebacker's first interception since 2023.

Okereke wasn't done there. The Giants' club winner for Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year later intercepted Joe Milton III, who had replaced Prescott in the second half.

Outside linebacker Brian Burns finished his third Pro Bowl season with a career-high 16.5 sacks, tying Jason Pierre-Paul (2011) for fourth in a single season in Giants history.

Burns did not have a sack in the finale, but he did record his 31st quarterback hit of the season. It snapped a tie with Leonard Williams (30 in 2020) for the most by any Giant since the stat began being tracked in 2006.

With one more tackle for loss against the Cowboys, Burns also increased his season total to 22, the most by a Giant since Pierre-Paul had 23 in 2011.

Ward has been initially diagnosed with a Grade 3 AC joint sprain in his right shoulder, per The Athletic’s Jeff Howe and Titans insider Paul Kuharsky.
Ward landed on shoulder of his throwing arm while reaching for the end zone on the Titans’ first drive of Sunday’s game in Jacksonville.
AC joint sprain recovery times vary depending on the degree of severity.
The team saw former starter Will Levis suffer an AC joint sprain early in his second year with the team.","Titans quarterback Cam Ward‘s rookie season came to an unceremoniously early ending today when he exited today’s season finale with an injury. Ward has been initially diagnosed with a Grade 3 AC joint sprain in his right shoulder, per The Athletic’s Jeff Howe and Titans insider Paul Kuharsky.

Ward landed on shoulder of his throwing arm while reaching for the end zone on the Titans’ first drive of Sunday’s game in Jacksonville. Jaguars linebacker Foyesade Oluokun landed on top of the No. 1 overall pick, driving him harder into the ground. Ward briefly went into the blue tent before making his way to the locker room and was seen later on the sideline in sweats.

Despite the injury, the 23-year-old started every game for the Titans in his rookie campaign. Though Ward had appeared on the team’s injury report back in Week 4 with ankle/calf issues, and though Ward was the most-sacked quarterback in the NFL this year (55, tied with Raiders quarterback Geno Smith), Ward had played 100 percent of the team’s offensive snaps up to that point of the season. Backup quarterback Brandon Allen‘s first snaps today were Tennessee’s first offensive snaps without Ward on the field this year.

AC joint sprain recovery times vary depending on the degree of severity. A milder Grade 1 sprain may take a couple weeks to shake off, whereas a Grade 3 sprain could take several months to recover from. The team saw former starter Will Levis suffer an AC joint sprain early in his second year with the team. He was cleared after the Titans’ bye week and started the next game without missing any time, but he reaggravated the injury in his first game after the injury and was sidelined for the next three weeks. Levis underwent season-ending shoulder surgery in July before this season, but it’s unclear if the procedure was related to the AC joint sprain or a more recent injury.

Ward’s injury ended a rookie season that he will want to quickly move on from. Coming into the final week of the season, Ward ranked 25th in the NFL in passing yards per game and dead last in touchdowns per pass attempt. As mentioned above, he also led the league in sacks taken and yards lost from sacks. Many of these troubling stats can be attributed to Ward adjusting to the speed difference from college to the pros, but the quality of the players around him should not be ignored.

While Ward certainly needs to get the ball out quicker in certain situations, he was under pressure on 27.9 percent of his pass attempts, the third-highest percentage in the league. His receivers also racked up the 12th-most drops in the NFL and finished 27th in the NFL in yards after catch. Ward did show bright spots, though, like only throwing seven interceptions, good for an interception rate of 1.3 percent — the third-best such figure in the NFL this year. He also was able to keep plays alive with his legs and turn broken plays into highlights, something he was known to do in college, as well.

All-in-all, the Titans still believe that Ward is their franchise quarterback, but his development is going to be crucial as he looks to take another step forward in Year 2. The team will likely have Ward undergo some testing to determine the exact severity of today’s injury, and they’ll hope that the resulting recovery time won’t keep him from being available for OTAs in May.

For some franchises — like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or New York Giants — there's actually a lot on the line during the final week of the regular season. For others — like the Miami Dolphins and Houston Texans — there's not a ton at stake that is going to drastically change the team's plans moving forward.

Because of that, teams treat the final week of the regular season much differently than every other week. A team that has already secured a postseason spot might opt to rest players, even if they can still move up or down in the seeding. A team that has no shot at the playoffs might opt to rest players too, not risking a catastrophic injury to a key star in a meaningless game.

Bengals inactives: QB Jake Browning (Emergency 3rd QB), WR Charlie Jones, CB Josh Newton, S Daijahn Anthony, DE Joseph Ossai, TE Cam Grandy, DT Jordan Jefferson

Colts vs. Texans

Colts inactives: CB Sauce Gardner, DT Eric Johnson II, S Reuben Lowery III, TE Will Mallory, S George Odum, QB Philip Rivers

Texans inactives: CB Kamari Lassiter, WR Nico Collins, WR Braxton Berrios, QB Graham Mertz, RB Nick Chubb, LB Jamal Hill, OT Trent Brown

Key absence: Nico Collins, WR, Houston Texans

The Houston Texans are safely in the playoffs, though the team could see its seeding move quite a bit depending on what happens in Week 18. The Texans enter the week as the No. 5 seed in the AFC, though the team could move as high as No. 3 and as low as No. 7 based on what happens during the final week of the regular season.

Despite that, star wideout Nico Collins is not expected to play when the Texans take on the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. Collins is not injured, and is considered a healthy scratch for the contest.

The 26-year-old is coming off yet another strong season, in which he hauled in 71 catches for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns. That performance earned Collins his second straight Pro Bowl nod.

Instead of pushing Collins for another week, the Texans will give the star some rest before the playoffs begin. After missing some time last season, Collins has stayed relatively healthy in 2025, missing just one game this season. Still, the Texans don't want to take any chances with their star ahead of the postseason.

Betting impact: Despite Collins' absence, there was minimal line movement, with the Texans going from -10 to -10.5.

Titans vs. Jaguars

Titans inactives: S Amani Hooker, OLB Arden Key, OG Drew Moss, OG Garrett Dellinger, OT Brandon Crenshaw-Dickson, TE Gunnar Helm

Jaguars inactives: CB Keith Taylor, OL PAtrick Mekari, TE Hunter Long, TE Patrick Herbert, DL Emmanuel Ogbah, DT Maason Smith

Packers vs. Vikings

Packers inactives: QB Malik Willis, LB Quay Walker, RB Josh Jacobs, WR Dontayvion Wicks, S Xavier McKinney, OT Zach Tom, LB Edgerrin Cooper

Vikings inactives: WR Myles Price, QB John Wolford (Emergency 3rd QB), QB Brett Rypien, RB Aaron Jones Sr., OT Walter Routes, TE T.J. Hockenson

Key absence: Jordan Love, QB, Green Bay Packers

The Green Bay Packers are the No. 7 seed in the NFC. The team can't move out of that spot. Because of that, Jordan Love, despite being cleared from a concussion, isn't expected to play in Week 18.

And with backup Malik Willis also dealing with injuries, the Packers announced earlier in the week Clayton Tune will get the start against the Minnesota Vikings. Willis will be inactive for the contest, and Love will serve as Tune's backup.

Since the news was announced previously, Love's absence shouldn't come as a surprise. Running back Josh Jacobs is also out.

Betting impact: Once it became clear the Packers were resting starters, the Vikings' line jumped from -6.5 to -12.5.

Cowboys vs. Giants

Cowboys inactives: LB DeMarvion Overshown, CB Shavon REvel, S Alijah Clark, DT Jay Toia, DT Perrion Winfrey

Giants inactives: S Jevón Holland, WR Ryan Miller, WR Jalin Hyatt, RB Dante Miller, OLB Caleb Murphy, TE Theo Johnson, QB Russell Wilson (Emergency 3rd QB)

NFL players expected to sit out in Week 18

The following players don't play in the early slate in Week 18, but are expected to sit Sunday:

Chargers vs. Broncos

Chargers inactives: DB Elijah Molden, S Derwin James Jr., RB Omarion Hampton, QB Justin Herbert, OLB Tuli Tuipulotu, OL Jamaree Salyer, C Bradley Bozeman

Broncos inactives: CB Reese Taylor, OLB Que Robinson, LB Dre Greenlaw, OT Geron Christian, TE Marcedes Lewis, DL John Franklin-Myers

Key absence: Justin Herbert, QB, Los Angeles Chargers

The Los Angeles Chargers have little to play for in Week 18. The team can move around in the AFC playoff seeding, but would still go on the road for every one of its first-round matchups.

Because of that, quarterback Justin Herbert is expected to sit, along with running back Omarion Hampton, pass rusher Khalil Mack and safety Derwin James. Herbert, Mack and James aren't battling injuries and are expected to miss the game against the Denver Broncos due to rest.

Herbert turned in another solid season with the Chargers. The 27-year-old finished the year with 3,727 yards and 26 touchdowns.

Key absence: Omarion Hampton, RB, Los Angeles Chargers

Rookie running back Omarion Hampton is also expected to sit for the Chargers in Week 18. Hampton missed a significant amount of time as a rookie thanks to an ankle injury. He played in just nine games, rushing for 545 yards and four touchdowns.

Hampton will miss Week 18 due to an ankle injury as well. He did not practice all week, and was ruled out for the game after the Friday practice report. His absence — unlike Herbert's or Mack's shouldn't come as a major surprise.

Hampton is hoping to play in the team's first playoff game, so the injury isn't expected to be serious.

Betting impact: Once it became clear the Chargers would treat Week 18 as a rest week, the line moved from Broncos -7.5 to Broncos -14, a significant jump.

Dolphins vs. Patriots

Dolphins inactives: QB Tua Tagovailoa (Emergency 3rd QB), QB Cam Miller, WR Jaylen Waddle, RB De'Von Achane, S Minkah Fitzpatrick, LB Chop Robinson, OL Austin Jackson

Patriots inactives: LB Harold Landry III, LB Robert Spillane, OT Marcus Bryant, G Jared Wilson, G Caedan Wallace, NT Khyiris Tonga, QB Tommy DeVito (emergency third QB)

Key absence: De'Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins

At 7-9, the Miami Dolphins have nothing to play for in Week 18. With the season essentially over, star running back De'Von Achane will reportedly sit out the final game of the regular season. He won't be the only key player on the team to miss the contest against the New England Patriots, as wideout Jaylen Waddle is also expected to sit.

It turned out to be an exceptional third season for Achane, who rushed for a career-high 1,350 yards and scored eight rushing touchdowns. He led the league in yards per attempt at 5.7.

Achane was also a threat as a receiver, gaining 488 yards through the air and scoring four receiving touchdowns. That performance earned him his first-ever trip to the Pro Bowl.

Given that there's little on the line for the Dolphins in Week 18, the move was likely made to ensure Achane stays healthy heading into the offseason. The Dolphins are a team that could experience major change after Week 18, as head coach Mike McDaniel could be fired and former starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa could also be on his way out. That could make Achane the most important player on the team's offense next season, which is a good reason to not risk a major injury in Week 18.

Key absence: Jaylen Waddle, WR, Miami Dolphins

Much like Achane, the Dolphins likely feel there's no reason to risk one of their top offensive players in a meaningless game. Also like Achane, Waddle could be one of the most impactful offensive players on the team next season, especially if the Dolphins also move on from Tyreek Hill.

Waddle finished his fifth NFL season with 910 receiving yards and six touchdowns. He hasn't hit the highs he showed early in his career, but remains a strong player who could take a step forward if Hill is shipped out in the offseason.

Betting impact: With both Achane and Waddle expected to sit vs. the Patriots, the Dolphins' line moved from +11.5 to +13.

Cardinals vs. Rams

Cardinals inactives: CB Max Melton, CB Kalen King, TE Rivaldo Fairweather, LB Austin Keys, OL Evan Brown, DL P.J. Mustipher, K Joshua Karty

Rams inactives: WR Davante Adams, TE Terrance Ferguson, RB Jarquez Hunter, CB Josh Wallace, CB Darious Williams, OL Kevin Dotson

Key absence: Davante Adams, WR, Los Angeles Rams

Los Angeles Rams wideout Davante Adams was able to return to practice in limited fashion during the week, but will receive another week of rest for his hamstring. Despite being listed as questionable for Week 18, Adams is not expected to play. He reportedly wanted to get out there, but head coach Sean McVay told him to rest up for the playoffs.

Adams is coming off an excellent season, in which he hauled in an NFL-leading 14 touchdowns in his first year with the Rams.

Jets vs. Bills

Jets inactives: QB Tyrod Taylor (Emergency 3rd QB), WR Tyler Johnson, RB Breece Hall, CB Brandon Stephens, CB Qwan'tez Stiggers, DL Michael Clemons, TE Jelani Woods

Bills inactives: LB Terrel Bernard, WR Brandin Cooks, S Jordan Poyer, DE Greg Rousseau, OT Dion Dawkins, DL DaQuan Jones, DE Joey Bosa

Lions vs. Bears

Lions inactives: LB Alex Anzalone, OL Kayode Awosika, S Thomas Harper, WR Dominic Lovett, DL Alim McNeill, OL Penei Sewell

Bears inactives: QB Case Keenum, DB Nick McCloud, OL Ozzy Trapilo, WR Rome Odunze, LB Ruben Hyppolite II, DL Joe Tyron-Shoyinka

Chiefs vs. Raiders

Chiefs inactives: WR Xavier Worthy, RB Isiah Pacheco, CB Melvin Smith, DE George Karlaftis, DE Tyreke Smith, OG Trey Smith, DT Mike Pennel

Raiders inactives: QB Geno Smith, S Terrell Edmunds, CB Chigozie Anusiem, RB Raheem Mostert, G Dylan Parham, DT Adam Butler, DT Brodric Martin
