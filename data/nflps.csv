Estimated Reading Time: 11 minutes

We're diving into the top rookies by PFF overall grade through the 2025 NFL regular season. To qualify, players needed to have logged at least 100 snaps.

1. TE Jackson Hawes, Buffalo Bills (85.2)

Hawes closed out the regular season with a 58.0 PFF game grade against the Jets. He was held to zero yards on his lone catch of the day. While he allowed no pressure on limited pass-blocking snaps (two), he generated a 26.7% negatively graded play rate as a run blocker, which led to a 59.0 PFF run-blocking grade.

The Bills were the sixth-best run-blocking team this regular season (75.7), with Hawes thriving in that department. The fifth-round pick played 335 run-blocking snaps at a team-high 70.4% rate. While Hawes struggled in gap-blocking schemes (55.8 PFF run-blocking grade), he earned the third-best PFF zone run-blocking grade (83.5) and ranked third at the position in overall PFF run-blocking grade (74.0).

Hawes' positively graded play rate as a run-blocker (14.6%) ranked seventh among rookie tight ends, while his negatively graded play rate (15.5%) ranked fourth best.

The 25-year-old recorded the sixth-best PFF pass-blocking grade at the position (78.7), surrendering zero pressure across 43 snaps this season. He was beaten only twice on those plays.

The Georgia Tech product also proved to be a reliable receiving option, albeit on a small sample size, as he brought in 16 of his 19 targets for 187 yards and three touchdowns. Hawes gained 13 first downs, secured two contested catches and forced four missed tackles. He tallied six catches of 15-plus yards. That culminated in a fourth-ranked 84.1 PFF receiving grade (minimum 15 targets).

2. TE Colston Loveland, Chicago Bears (82.5)

Loveland caught 10 of 13 targets for 91 yards in the Bears' Week 18 loss to the Lions. He gained four first downs, including a 27-yard gain midway through the fourth quarter against busted coverage after he was split out in a wide alignment. Loveland was brought down inside Detroit’s 15-yard line on the play, and he finished the drive off a few plays later with a one-yard touchdown catch to bring Chicago within two points. Loveland secured two contested catches and averaged 3.03 yards per route run in the game, earning a 79.2 PFF receiving grade.

Loveland logged 14 snaps in zone run-blocking schemes (64.4 PFF run-blocking grade). His 31.3% positively graded run-play rate in the game paced the rookie class, leading to a 62.0 PFF run-blocking grade. Overall, Loveland finished the week as the league's 10th-highest-graded tight end (80.6).

The 10th overall pick from Michigan became a prominent part of the Bears' passing attack in his first season, ranking in the top 15 at the position in targets (81), catches (58) and receiving yards (713). The 21-year-old gained 35 first downs (10th most) and caught six touchdown passes while recording 13 explosive gains of 15-plus yards. Loveland also secured nine of 18 contested targets on his way to a fourth-ranked 83.3 PFF receiving grade.

While Loveland struggled in pass protection this season (46.0 PFF pass-blocking grade), he was solid as a run blocker, ranking fourth among rookies in PFF run-blocking grade (68.6). Most of his snaps came in zone schemes (169), where he earned a 72.7 mark.

3. RB Cam Skattebo, New York Giants (80.5)

Skattebo did not play after Week 8 due to a season-ending leg injury.

4. WR Luther Burden III, Chicago Bears (79.4)

Burden tallied just three catches for 35 against the Lions, but each was a gain of 10-plus yards to move the chains in the second half. He averaged 9.3 yards after the catch per reception but dropped a critical pass with just over two minutes remaining and the game tied at 16, giving him three in his past four games.

The 22-year-old enters the playoffs with a top-32 PFF receiving grade (79.9, 22nd). He was the sixth-most-targeted rookie receiver this season (60), recording 47 catches for 652 yards. Burden ranked in the top two in the class in yards after the catch (342) and yards after contact (126), as well as sixth at the position in yards after the catch per reception (7.3).

The Missouri product caught two touchdown passes, gained 27 first downs and recorded 16 plays of 15-plus yards (third most). He also led all rookie receivers in forced missed tackles (10). Only Puka Nacua (3.71) and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (3.62) averaged more yards per route run than Burden (3.69) during the regular season.

Burden was used in a variety of ways within the Bears' offense, but he especially stood out on deep and play-action targets. He caught five of six targets 20-plus yards downfield for 193 yards, earning the sixth-best PFF receiving grade on those plays (99.5). Both of his touchdowns this season came from deep targets.

Meanwhile, Burden also recorded the sixth-best play-action PFF receiving grade (91.2), catching 21 of 23 targets for 13 first downs and 10 explosive gains.

5. WR Tetairoa McMillan, Carolina Panthers (78.7)

McMillan had another strong game against the Buccaneers in their clash for the NFC South title, finishing with the 11th-best PFF receiving grade for the week (76.6). He caught four of six passes for 85 yards — all first downs — with two explosive plays in the second half.

McMillan recorded a 19-yard catch across the middle early in the third quarter with Benjamin Morrison in coverage. His biggest catch came with three minutes remaining in the game, as he split Jacob Parrish and Tykee Smith downfield for a 40-yard pickup on fourth-and-8, going down inside the Buccaneers' 10-yard line with the Panthers down by nine. That catch helped set up a touchdown two plays later. McMillan also earned the fifth-best PFF run-blocking grade at the position for the week (79.9).

That 40-yard catch helped McMillan set a new Panthers rookie receiving record (1,014 yards) — a mark previously held by Kelvin Benjamin (1,008) in 2014. The 2025 eighth overall pick caught 70 passes in the regular season, finishing in the top 15 in receiving yards, touchdowns (seven) and first downs (55). McMillan also ranked 10th in plays of 15-plus yards (30).

McMillan, like Luther Burden III, enters the playoffs with a top-32 PFF receiving grade (78.7). He continues to thrive downfield, earning elite 95.0-plus PFF receiving grades at the Intermediate (97.2) and deep (96.3) levels of the field. He has caught 24 passes between 10 and 19 yards for 440 yards (11th most) and has brought in 10 catches 20-plus yards downfield for 277 yards and four touchdowns.

6. RB Omarion Hampton, Los Angeles Chargers (77.4)

Hampton missed Week 18 with an ankle injury. Head coach Jim Harbaugh said the rookie is “doing everything and anything he can to get back as fast as he can,” per beat reporter Alex Insdorf.

7. T Will Campbell, New England Patriots (76.6)

Campbell returned to the field after missing the previous five weeks with a knee injury. The fourth overall pick graded out as the 10th-best offensive tackle of the week, earning a 74.3 PFF overall grade against the Dolphins. Campbell was beaten three times in pass protection and surrendered a hit, earning a 69.4 PFF pass-blocking grade across 23 snaps.

Campbell fared much better in run blocking, tallying a 10th-ranked 74.4 PFF run-blocking grade for the week. He spent most of his time in gap schemes (67.7, 16 snaps), where he posted the fourth-best impact-block rate among starting left tackles (15.0%) as well as the sixth-best defeated rate (5.0%).

The 22-year-old LSU product has been the highest-graded rookie pass protector this season (76.1), surrendering 26 pressures across 449 snaps for a 5.8% pressure rate (10th best). Campbell has struggled a little more in run blocking (67.7 PFF run-blocking grade), with his impact-block rate (10.8%) ranking among the bottom half of starting left tackles. However, his defeated rate (10.8%) ranks seventh best among the group. The 6-foot-6 tackle has been at his best in zone run-blocking schemes, earning a 68.1 mark across 91 snaps.

8. T Armand Membou, New York Jets (76.5)

Membou finished as the 10th-best pass-protecting tackle in Week 18, earning an 82.2 PFF pass-blocking grade against the Bills. He played 24 snaps in pass protection without surrendering any pressure, closing his season with only one pressure allowed across his final three games (102 pass-blocking snaps). Membou struggled more in run blocking, earning a 65.4 PFF run-blocking grade across 22 snaps. He still finished the day with the 12th-best PFF overall grade among tackles (72.4).

The seventh overall pick from Missouri ended his rookie campaign with 70.0-plus PFF grades in pass protection (73.8) and run blocking (72.1). Membou allowed 33 pressures across 610 pass-blocking snaps, generating a rookie-best 5.4% pressure rate. The 21-year-old also ranked in the top two among starting rookie tackles in impact-block rate (12.7%) and defeated rate (13.7%) as a run blocker. He spent most of his time in zone blocking schemes (255 snaps), where he earned an 82.3 PFF run-blocking grade.

9. T Kelvin Banks Jr., New Orleans Saints (76.4)

Banks' rookie season ended on a sour note after he suffered a leg injury in the first half against the Falcons. He played 14 snaps in the game, garnering an 83.6 PFF pass-blocking grade after giving up no pressure on 10 snaps.

The 21-year-old ninth overall pick finished the year with 70.0-plus PFF grades in both blocking phases. As a run blocker, he ranked second among rookie tackles in impact-block rate (11.4%) while performing exceptionally well in zone schemes (81.2), helping him finish the season with a 76.2 PFF run-blocking grade.

10. LB Jihaad Campbell, Philadelphia Eagles (76.2)

Campbell played 56 snaps in the regular-season finale against the Commanders. He recorded two run stops, holding runners to four yards on those plays, but he also missed a tackle en route to a 67.8 PFF run-defense grade.

Campbell was targeted four times in coverage, allowing three catches for 39 yards and two first downs. He was able to force an incompletion, tipping a pass intended for Deebo Samuel in the second quarter, and earned a 65.8 PFF coverage grade for the game.

The first-round pick from Alabama showed plenty of promise, despite a role reduction in the second half of the season. He placed third among rookie linebackers in PFF run-defense grade (69.7) after recording 29 total tackles with 13 run stops while generating the lowest negatively graded play rate among the same group.

Campbell's 12 pressures tied him with the Browns‘ Carson Schwesinger, and he paced the linebacker class in pass-rush win rate (20.0%) and pressure rate (21.8%).

He remained at his best in coverage, where he tied for the sixth-best PFF coverage grade at the position (78.6). He allowed 24 catches on 32 targets for 271 yards (second-lowest yardage total allowed among rookie linebackers with at least 25 targets). He gave up seven first downs and a touchdown but also recorded six stops and two forced incompletions.

Campbell was a strong tackler, recording 81 tackles with 21 stops and posting the best missed tackle rate (7.3%) in the rookie class.

11. EDGE Abdul Carter, New York Giants (74.7)

Carter earned the fifth-best PFF pass-rush grade for the week (86.2), recording five pressures across 25 snaps. Although he missed a tackle in run defense that led to a first down in the second quarter, Carter finished Week 18 with the 15th-best PFF overall grade among edge rushers (82.0).

The third overall pick has already emerged as one of the NFL's best pass rushers, ranking 10th in PFF pass-rush grade this regular season (84.5). He recorded 66 pressures (tied for 11th most) at a rate of 14.0% and ranked in the top 10 in hurries (43) and quarterback hits (18). He also logged five sacks and ranked in the top two among rookie edge defenders in pressure rate and win rate.

12. QB, Tyler Shough, New Orleans Saints (74.6)

Shough had his ups and downs in the Saints' season finale against the Falcons. He hit Ronnie Bell in the corner of the end zone for a 16-yard touchdown with just over a minute remaining in the game to bring his team within three points. But he also threw a pick on a third-down play on the previous drive.

Shough made two big-time throws in the game, with his touchdown accounting for one and the other coming on a perfectly placed downfield pass to Juwan Johnson late in the first quarter for a 28-yard gain. Outside of his interception, Shough made a second turnover-worthy play, also in the first quarter, with CJ Henderson breaking up a pass intended for Kevin Austin Jr.

The rookie completed 23 of 35 passes for 259 yards and a 53.6 PFF passing grade to close out his campaign. He was sacked four times but also had three rushes for 34 yards, including a 29-yard fourth-quarter scramble and a one-yard touchdown run in the second quarter.

The 26-year-old earned the 13th-best PFF passing grade in his 10 weeks as a starter this season (73.1). He ranked eighth in adjusted completion rate (77.0%) and passing yards (2,384). Shough threw for 10 touchdowns and six interceptions while recording the sixth-best turnover-worthy play rate (1.8%). He was the only rookie quarterback this season to tally a PFF passing grade above 70.0.

The second-round pick from Louisville threw outside the numbers often, ranking fourth in passing attempts (153). He completed 63.4% of his outside passes for 1,134 yards (sixth most) and an 82.2 PFF passing grade (ninth best). Eight of his 10 touchdowns this season stemmed from passes outside of the numbers.

13. CB Nohl Williams, Kansas City Chiefs (74.5)

The third-round pick from California made plays all over the place in the Chiefs' loss to the Raiders. He was left alone for a sack on his lone pass-rushing snap of the day, and he added two tackles in run defense across 30 snaps en route to the fourth-best PFF run-defense grade (80.8) of the week.

Williams was particularly sticky in coverage, allowing only two catches on six targets for 17 yards. He also forced two incompletions and recorded a coverage stop, earning him a 76.4 PFF coverage grade. Overall, Williams graded out as the 10th-best cornerback in Week 18 (82.1 PFF overall grade).

Williams was a top-two rookie cornerback in almost every defensive facet this season. He recorded seven tackles with three stops in run defense, earning a 74.7 PFF run-defense grade on those plays. He also recorded three pressures on eight pass-rushing snaps for a 73.9 PFF pass-rushing grade.

Finally, Williams generated a 19.4% forced incompletion rate in coverage, allowing 20 catches on 36 targets for 227 yards. He surrendered a touchdown and eight first downs but also recorded 10 coverage stops across 257 snaps. Williams was at his best in zone coverage, where he led the rookie class with a 73.3 PFF coverage grade.

14. LB Carson Schwesinger, Cleveland Browns (74.4)

The Browns placed Schwesinger on injured reserve ahead of Week 18 due to a quad injury.

15. DI Walter Nolen, Arizona Cardinals (74.1)

Nolen suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 16 and was placed on injured reserve.",https://media.pff.com/2026/01/Hawes-Jackson-Feature-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675,N,,2026-01-06 17:00:43.340891

On Tuesday, the Bears officially opened the 21-day practice windows for offensive tackle Braxton Jones and cornerback Kyler Gordon, designating both to return from injured reserve.

The move means that either player could be activated ahead of Saturday’s game, though the team will have both practice during the week to see if they will be healthy enough for a return to action.

Gordon has only appeared in three games so far this season, and was placed on injured reserve for a groin injury earlier this year. He has seven tackles and a sack to his credit this season.

His return could be consequential for the Bears as they have cornerback CJ Gardner-Johnson working through the NFL’s concussion protocol, leaving his status up in the air for Saturday.

Jones suffered a knee injury against the New Orleans Saints in Week 7, leaving the Bears to reconfigure their offensive line in his absence.

If he ends up returning for Saturday, it would likely be in a limited or reserve role, which would still boos the team’s depth as they try to win a playoff game for the first time since the 2011 postseason.

Then, Wilson went about his business, staying silent about the hamstring injury.
Through it all, nothing was said to anyone about the secret hamstring injury until today.
Regardless of Wilson’s claim that the Giants didn’t know, the failure of the Giants to disclose the injury via an update to the Week 2 injury report will undoubtedly attract the league’s attention.
Claiming the Giants didn’t know isn’t nearly enough to put the toothpaste back in the tube.","On Monday, Giants quarterback Russell Wilson said he suffered a previously-undisclosed Grade 2 hamstring tear on the last play of Friday’s practice before a Week 2 overtime loss to the Cowboys.

Wilson later reacted to the suggestion that this development will result in the NFL scrutinizing the Giants for failing to disclose the injury.

“Not the [Giants] fault!” Wilson said on Twitter. “They didn’t know bc I didn’t want to tell anyone bc of the circumstances. I just had to play through it to try and go ball that day! Thought we were going to Win that wild crazy game!”

Wilson had said this to reporters on Monday morning: “I played that [Week 2] game, you know, I tore my hamstring on Friday in practice — the last play of practice. And I had a grade two [tear]. I couldn’t tell anybody. I had to go and play on it just because I knew the circumstance, I had to play on it, no matter what. I actually ended up going to the Dallas Mavericks’ facility, training. And, you know, kept it quiet, just trying to get treatment on it and just knowing that I probably couldn’t run from the goal line to the 10-yard line if I wanted to, but I feel like, you know, I got to play this game.”

Under Wilson’s version, he said nothing to anyone from the team about the hamstring injury that occurred during a practice rep, in the presence of teammates, coaches, and anyone else who was there. And no one noticed that anything was amiss — even though, as anyone who has ever suffered a hamstring injury knows, it’s something that prompts a reaction in the form of immediate limping and/or grabbing at the back of the leg.

Then, Wilson went about his business, staying silent about the hamstring injury. He flew with the team to Dallas (no high knees on the plane), arranging a secret treatment session at the Dallas Mavericks’ training facility while breathing not a word of his condition to anyone with the team.

Once in Dallas, he left the Giants to get treatment on the hamstring from the local NBA franchise, again with no one from team management (or, apparently, anyone else) knowing what was happening.

He returned, prepared for the game, played in it, and kept completely quiet about the situation — to the point that the injury didn’t appear on the team’s Week 3 injury report, either. Or Week 4, when he was benched for Jaxson Dart. (Wilson next appeared on the injury report in Week 5, with an ankle injury that did not impact his practice availability.)

Through it all, nothing was said to anyone about the secret hamstring injury until today.

Regardless of Wilson’s claim that the Giants didn’t know, the failure of the Giants to disclose the injury via an update to the Week 2 injury report will undoubtedly attract the league’s attention. (The NFL declined comment on the situation via email to PFT on Monday.)

The prevalence of gambling makes the injury report more important than ever. While it’s unclear whether a team is responsible for an injury that the player affirmatively and successfully conceals from the organization, Wilson’s comments compels the league to launch an inquiry. The NBA’s latest gambling scandal has underscored the importance of ensuring full compliance with the injury-reporting rules.

Speaking of the NBA, that league could have questions about the Mavericks’ apparent willingness to provide secret treatment to Wilson. If, as Wilson says, he went to the Mavs’ facility to get the injury treated, someone there knew about the injury — and participated in its concealment.

Then there’s the question of why Wilson wouldn’t say anything to the team about the injury. Did he fear that he’d be benched for the Week 2 game, if the Giants believed he was less than 100 percent? (Apparently, he did.)

Regardless, Wilson said enough to activate curiosity from the league. Claiming the Giants didn’t know isn’t nearly enough to put the toothpaste back in the tube. Either the NFL cares about the integrity of its injury rules, or it doesn’t.

Boston concludes its five-game road trip on Tuesday night against the Seattle Kraken. The Bruins practiced on Monday, and Lindholm wasn’t on the ice. Following practice, head coach Marco Sturm said he’d be out for a little while.

“It is not going to be a day-to-day thing,” Sturm said on Monday. “Hopefully not too long, but he’s definitely going to be out for a little bit. We have to do more testing when we’re back in Boston, so we can go from there.”

Lindholm has been an impact player for the Bruins, as he’s recorded one goal and two assists for three points in the last two games. Overall, this season, he’s skated in 34 games, recording three goals and 11 assists for 14 points.

Although Lindholm will be out of the lineup, Sturm said defenseman Henri Jokiharju, who’s been sidelined with an injury since Nov. 28, is a game-time decision.

“(Jokiharju) and (Tanner Jeannot) both look pretty good and pretty close,” Sturm said. “We are going to decide tomorrow, sleep (on it). Both are very important pieces to our team, especially with Hampus. He’s been hurt. That will be a nice addition to our game.”

Jokiharju skated on the Bruins’ second-pairing alongside Nikita Zadorov during practice on Monday, which could signal him getting back into the lineup. He’s skated in 25 games, recording six assists.

Two days after the season ended with the Cowboys finishing last in the league in points per game and 30th in yards per game, Eberflus was relieved of his duties.

""Having known Matt Eberflus for decades now, we have tremendous respect and appreciation for him as a coach and a person. After reviewing and discussing the results of our defensive performance this season, though, it was clear that change is needed,"" Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones said in a statement. ""This is the first step in that process, and we will continue that review as it applies to reaching our much higher expectations.""

As a result, the Cowboys will be looking for their fourth defensive coordinator in as many years after Dan Quinn (2023), Mike Zimmer (2024) and Eberflus (2025).

The Cowboys' history with Eberflus -- he was an assistant coach from 2011 to 2017 -- and his track record as a quality defensive coordinator led Brian Schottenheimer to add him as defensive coordinator, but things never clicked.

For the first time in franchise history, the Cowboys allowed more than 30 points per game (30.1), giving up a team-record 511 points. This was the seventh time since Jones became the owner and general manager in 1989 that a Cowboys defense allowed 400 or more points and after each occasion there has been a coordinator change or radical scheme change.

The Cowboys traded All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons the week before the season started and failed to secure a consistent pass rush. The Cowboys finished with 35 sacks, their fewest since 2020 when they had 31, which was the final 16-game regular season.

Opponents scored more than 30 points nine times. The Cowboys allowed either a touchdown or field goal on 91 of 177 drives on the season. They allowed 377 yards per game, which was third worst in the league. The 12 takeaways were the fewest in a season since 2015 (8 interceptions, 3 fumble recoveries).

While there was improvement in the run defense, it still ranked just 23rd.

Eberflus took ownership for the poor season, but also said he would not have done anything different if he could do it over again. Unable to consistently get after the quarterback, the Cowboys' secondary was picked apart. Opposing quarterbacks completed 68.5% of the passes.

Even middling quarterbacks had success against Dallas. Russell Wilson threw for 450 yards and three touchdowns in Week 2 but was benched by the New York Giants after one more start. Justin Fields threw for a season-high 282 yards for the New York Jets with two touchdown passes. He did not have another game with more than one touchdown pass before he was benched late last month. Minnesota's J.J. McCarthy threw for a season-high 250 yards against the Cowboys, averaging 10.4 yards per attempt.

In a Week 16 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, the Cowboys did not sack Justin Herbert despite him entering the game as the most-sacked quarterback in the NFL.

At times during the season, owner and general manager Jerry Jones expressed displeasure with the defense but also did not put all of the blame on Eberflus.

The trade for Pro Bowl defensive tackle Quinnen Williams stabilized the defense during a three-game winning streak, but that did not hold up down the stretch. The Cowboys also traded for Cincinnati linebacker Logan Wilson, but he did not see a snap of action in a Week 17 win against the Washington Commanders.

Former Pro Bowl cornerbacks Trevon Diggs and DaRon Bland barely played at the same time. Bland's season was cut short by a foot injury that required surgery. Diggs questioned Eberflus' scheme, wanting to play more man coverage. He missed six games with a concussion and a knee injury, before he was waived on Dec. 30.

The Cowboys have two first-round picks in the upcoming draft but do not have picks in the second and third rounds because of trades for Williams (Jets) and wide receiver George Pickens (Pittsburgh Steelers).

They are certain to face a defensive makeover with five starters or regulars set to hit free agency.

But it is a makeover, in coordinator and/or scheme, that will be necessary after what happened in 2025.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0918%2Fr1547613_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 19:01:38.937676

“I do expect Nakobe to play,” Fangio said.

Dean, 25, has been a key player since he rejoined the starting lineup in Week 8. Dean suffered a devastating knee injury in the opening round of last season’s playoffs and missed the Eagles’ Super Bowl run and the start of the 2025 season. It was unknown how he would fit in this season, coming off the injury and joining a lineup that added first-round pick Jihaad Campbell, but Dean quickly returned to his starting role next to Zack Baun.

Dean has played even better this season, effective against the run and proving to be a dangerous blitzer (four sacks). His return has been a major reason why the Eagles have been one of the NFL’s best defenses during the second half of the season. The Eagles allowed only 15 points per game from Weeks 8 to 15.

The linebackers will be tested Sunday against a 49ers offense that can put strain on the middle of the field with Christian McCaffrey and George Kittle.

Week 18 of the 2025 NFL season is in the books. That means that the playoffs are just around the corner. Unfortunately, most NFL teams will not make the playoffs and their seasons have already ended. That puts a completely different perspective on the injuries that some players suffered during this past weekend’s games.

Suffering an injury is never good, but it helps when a player has the entire offseason to recover.

In this week’s NFL injury roundup, we will mostly cover players on teams that are still alive in the playoffs. However, we’ll also touch on a couple of important quarterback injuries headed into the offseason.

Let’s explore the most important injuries from Week 18 of the 2025 NFL season.

Titans QB Cam Ward (shoulder)

The Titans ended the 2025 season on a low note. Not only did they get blown out by the Jaguars, but their rookie quarterback left the game early with an injury.

Ward suffered an injury to his right shoulder during the first half. He was quickly removed from the meaningless Week 18 game and did not return.

Interim head coach Mike McCoy said after the game that Ward would receive further testing on Monday to determine the severity of his injury. Fortunately, he avoided the worst-case scenario.

Ward has an AC joint sprain that will not require surgery.

Now Titans fans can rest easy knowing that their franchise quarterback should be completely healthy during the offseason.

Vikings QB J.J. McCarthy (hand)

McCarthy just can’t seem to stay healthy early in his NFL career.

Minnesota’s second-year quarterback left Week 18 early after reaggravating an injury to his throwing hand. He sustained a hairline fracture in Week 16 and did not play in Week 17.

McCarthy took himself out of the game after making an awkward throw.

The young quarterback’s health will be under the microscope during the offseason. Especially considering the pressure that Minnesota will be under to win a playoff game in 2026.

Vikings fans should keep their eyes and ears open for updates on McCarthy’s hand injury.

49ers QB Brock Purdy (shoulder)

Now the rest of these injuries will be for players on playoff teams. Let’s start with Purdy.

San Francisco’s franchise quarterback suffered a stinger on his left shoulder during Saturday’s loss to Seattle. The injury occurred on the final play of the game, which made it initially all the more concerning.

Thankfully, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported on Sunday that Purdy is not expected to miss the team’s wild-card game against the Eagles.

The 49ers are in the fortunate situation of having a backup quarterback (Mac Jones) who has already been battle tested this season. So San Francisco should be okay no matter what.

Rams WR Jordan Whittington (knee)

LA’s second-year receiver went down with a knee injury on Sunday against the Cardinals.

Whittington was initially ruled as questionable to return. However, he was ruled out for the rest of the game shortly after being evaluated.

Rams head coach Sean McVay said on Monday that Whittington will have an MRI to determine the severity of his injury.

If Whittington ends up missing some time, backups Tutu Atwell and Xavier Smith would likely get more snaps.

Meanwhile, linebacker Shaun Dolac also left Sunday’s game with a knee injury. He did not return.

It is currently unclear whether Dolac or Whittington will be able to suit up against the Panthers this weekend.

Bills CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle)

Buffalo’s rookie cornerback left Week 18’s game against New York with an ankle injury.

Hairston did not return, which likely made Bills fans fear the worst ahead of the playoffs. Unfortunately, the team got some bad news on Monday.

The rookie is considered week-to-week with his ankle injury and is unlikely to play against Jacksonville this weekend.

The Bills will likely turn to veteran Tre’Davious White to fill in for Hairston against the Jaguars.

Hairston finished the regular season with 14 solo tackles, five passes defensed, and two interceptions.

Hopefully he can return after a week of rest, assuming the Bills take care of business down in Duval County.

Bethune's ailment not the only linebacker injury. Dee Winters (ankle) and Luke Gifford (quadriceps) will be evaluated throughout the week ahead of the 49ers' wild card game against the Philadelphia Eagles after picking up injuries in the Seattle game, Shanahan said.

The only other linebackers on San Francisco's current active roster are Curtis Robinson and Garret Wallow. Robinson has not played since Week 15; Wallow only joined the team less than a month ago, though he ended up seeing 40 defensive snaps against the Seahawks.

The 49ers also have Eric Kendricks, signed in late November, on the practice squad; the 11th-year veteran got his first start of the year in Week 18 and will likely play a big role again.

""I'm real confident in Eric,"" Shanahan said. ""He's been here long enough, he's gotten in in the last couple of weeks, and I'm glad we got him for this situation.""

Let's explore the most important injuries from Week 18 of the 2025 NFL season.
He was quickly removed from the meaningless Week 18 game and did not return.
Minnesota's second-year quarterback left Week 18 early after reaggravating an injury to his throwing hand.","Week 18 of the 2025 NFL season is in the books. That means that the playoffs are just around the corner. Unfortunately, most NFL teams will not make the playoffs and their seasons have already ended. That puts a completely different perspective on the injuries that some players suffered during this past weekend's games.

Suffering an injury is never good, but it helps when a player has the entire offseason to recover.

In this week's NFL injury roundup, we will mostly cover players on teams that are still alive in the playoffs. However, we'll also touch on a couple of important quarterback injuries headed into the offseason.

Let's explore the most important injuries from Week 18 of the 2025 NFL season.

Titans QB Cam Ward (shoulder)

The Titans ended the 2025 season on a low note. Not only did they get blown out by the Jaguars, but their rookie quarterback left the game early with an injury.

Ward suffered an injury to his right shoulder during the first half. He was quickly removed from the meaningless Week 18 game and did not return.

Interim head coach Mike McCoy said after the game that Ward would receive further testing on Monday to determine the severity of his injury. Fortunately, he avoided the worst-case scenario.

Ward has an AC joint sprain that will not require surgery.

Now Titans fans can rest easy knowing that their franchise quarterback should be completely healthy during the offseason.

Vikings QB J.J. McCarthy (hand)

McCarthy just can't seem to stay healthy early in his NFL career.

Minnesota's second-year quarterback left Week 18 early after reaggravating an injury to his throwing hand. He sustained a hairline fracture in Week 16 and did not play in Week 17.

McCarthy took himself out of the game after making an awkward throw.

The young quarterback's health will be under the microscope during the offseason. Especially considering the pressure that Minnesota will be under to win a playoff game in 2026.

Vikings fans should keep their eyes and ears open for updates on McCarthy's hand injury.

49ers QB Brock Purdy (shoulder)

Now the rest of these injuries will be for players on playoff teams. Let's start with Purdy.

San Francisco's franchise quarterback suffered a stinger on his left shoulder during Saturday's loss to Seattle. The injury occurred on the final play of the game, which made it initially all the more concerning.

Thankfully, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported on Sunday that Purdy is not expected to miss the team's wild-card game against the Eagles.

The 49ers are in the fortunate situation of having a backup quarterback (Mac Jones) who has already been battle tested this season. So San Francisco should be okay no matter what.

Rams WR Jordan Whittington (knee)

LA's second-year receiver went down with a knee injury on Sunday against the Cardinals.

Whittington was initially ruled as questionable to return. However, he was ruled out for the rest of the game shortly after being evaluated.

Rams head coach Sean McVay said on Monday that Whittington will have an MRI to determine the severity of his injury.

If Whittington ends up missing some time, backups Tutu Atwell and Xavier Smith would likely get more snaps.

Meanwhile, linebacker Shaun Dolac also left Sunday's game with a knee injury. He did not return.

It is currently unclear whether Dolac or Whittington will be able to suit up against the Panthers this weekend.

Bills CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle)

Buffalo's rookie cornerback left Week 18's game against New York with an ankle injury.

Hairston did not return, which likely made Bills fans fear the worst ahead of the playoffs. Unfortunately, the team got some bad news on Monday.

The rookie is considered week-to-week with his ankle injury and is unlikely to play against Jacksonville this weekend.

The Bills will likely turn to veteran Tre'Davious White to fill in for Hairston against the Jaguars.

Hairston finished the regular season with 14 solo tackles, five passes defensed, and two interceptions.

Hopefully he can return after a week of rest, assuming the Bills take care of business down in Duval County.",https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Brock-Purdy-on-Dec.-28-2025.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:02:22.909873

Atlanta Falcons (fired Raheem Morris) Total: 15 QB situation (3): Have we ruled out Michael Penix Jr. as a franchise quarterback?
Franchise stability (6): If we’re going by purely reputation, the Falcons have the best among the teams with head-coaching openings.
That is where there’s a good chance the roster talent isn’t as bad as the other teams on this list.","The Arizona Cardinals need a head coach after firing Jonathan Gannon. During their last coaching search, the rest of the NFL job openings were snapped up before Arizona could land on its hire of Gannon.

Ultimately, this process comes down to selling yourself to a pool of candidates who have a decent bit of leverage. If other teams have more appealing situations, you might miss.

Or you take a risk on pursuing a candidate nobody else is, something that ended up happening with the Gannon hire — because of timing at least.

How enticing is Arizona’s job opening? Quarterback Kyler Murray appears to be on the way out. The roster-building under remaining general manager Monti Ossenfort has been happening for three years with mixed results. What do the other gigs have that Arizona does not?

To do this in an organized way, we’re giving each team’s quarterback situation, franchise stability and roster talent a rating from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best-case scenario. And then we’re ranking the job in terms of desirability based on the totals.

Ranking the NFL’s head-coaching openings by QB situation, stability and roster talent

1. New York Giants (fired Brian Daboll)

Total: 16

QB situation (7 out of 10): Jaxson Dart’s emergence was a breath of fresh air for a franchise struggling to build confidence among its fan base, and he produced with 2,272 yards, 63.7% accuracy and 15 touchdowns to five picks — plus nine rushing scores.

His bro-nection with Arizona State product Cam Skattebo gives the team easy-to-root-for leaders, so long as both remain healthy. Concussion issues cropped up for Dart a handful of times. A new head coach must connect with them.

We are pretty sure Dart is a guy to build around.

Franchise stability (3): General manager Joe Schoen is 22-45-1 with a single playoff appearance since he joined the team. This is probably his last chance to get it right.

Beyond that, the Giants have had a single winning season since 2016. Schoen, at present, is most well-known for giving a reason to let very good running back Saquon Barkley walk, while being filmed for Hard Knocks. Not great awareness.

Roster talent (6): The skill player talent is there, with Skattebo and Malik Nabers giving Dart something to work with on offense. Defensively, a front that includes Dexter Lawrence, Brian Burns, Kayvon Thibodeaux and Abdul Carter is the strength of the roster.

New York’s offensive line needs a reboot, and what’s behind the defensive line needs it, too.

The Giants have the No. 5 pick.

T-2. Atlanta Falcons (fired Raheem Morris)

Total: 15

QB situation (3): Have we ruled out Michael Penix Jr. as a franchise quarterback? Probably? I guess? That’s generous, even if you get over his many seasons dating back to college that ended with a serious knee injury. And he’ll miss the start of next season with a knee injury. Kirk Cousins is probably gone. Atlanta doesn’t have a first-round pick, so the options don’t look excellent at the moment.

Franchise stability (6): If we’re going by purely reputation, the Falcons have the best among the teams with head-coaching openings. They’ve just failed to get out of the mediocre zone since the 2017 season and Matt Ryan era. More decent news: A first-year general manager will be replacing Terry Fontenot, so this coach will be tied to whomever that guy is.

Roster talent (6): Eight wins is still eight wins, a sign this team wasn’t lacking in talent to a huge degree. Running back Bijan Robinson is whom the offense will revolve around. But among the questions is tight end Kyle Pitts, who finally appeared to figure it out and led the team with 928 receiving yards. He’s a free agent if they don’t franchise-tag him.

Leading tackler and linebacker Kaden Elliss, plus backup running back Tyler Allgeier, are free agents as well.

This team won four games to end the year, some against very good playoff squads.

T-2. Tennessee Titans (fired Brian Callahan)

Total: 15

QB situation (7): Rookie first overall pick Cam Ward took a beating playing for a team that had no clear No. 1 receiver. He and the Raiders’ Geno Smith tied for the NFL lead with 55 sacks taken, but at least the touchdown-to-pick ratio (15 to seven) wasn’t terrible. Ward’s arm talent gave Titans fans something to look forward to at least, but consecutive three-win seasons speak to the roster talent issues in Tennessee.

Franchise stability (4): It looks a little worse now that former head coach Mike Vrabel, who left in 2023, is doing so well so quickly with the New England Patriots. Maybe that is just about optics and timing, where he saw the end of the Ryan Tannehill era, and quarterback prospects Will Levis and Malik Willis didn’t pan out.

Some more weird optics: Owner Amy Adams Strunk clarified this week that GM Mike Borgonzi will run the 53-man roster and coaching staff, while president of football operations Chad Brinker will do the other stuff. Better late than never to clarify job descriptions, I suppose.

Roster talent (4): There’s no No. 1 receiver but plenty of No. 2 or No. 3 options. The Titans have running back Tony Pollard under contract and a defense bolstered by tackle Jeffery Simmons. Holding the No. 4 pick, Tennessee could use a difference-making wideout, a defensive back or linebacker.

The Titans have the cash to spend big in free agency as well. Shoring up the offensive line will need to be done with that cash.

4. Cleveland Browns (fired Kevin Stefanski)

Total: 14

QB situation (4): Deshaun Watson began practicing on the field toward the end of the year and makes $80.7 million coming off a foot injury. He has played 19 whole games since 2022, and we are unsure if he is worth a quarter of that price tag, even if we skip over the sexual assault allegations that we absolutely cannot skip over.

Rookies Dillon Gabriel (937 yards, seven touchdowns, two picks, 80.8 passer rating) and Shedeur Sanders (1,400 yards, seven touchdowns, 10 picks, 68.1 passer rating) might have burned two 2024 draft picks to answer the backup quarterback question. Sanders did look like he had a leap toward the end of the year, and the Browns at least have options in-house.

Franchise stability (3): Did you read the section above? The only good news here is that the Browns live in a division of mediocrity, with the Steelers and Ravens underachieving until the end and the Cincinnati Bengals getting six wins despite the past offseason financial efforts to keep their quarterback-receiver talent intact.

Roster talent (6): Myles Garrett is still awesome! There are some talented pieces elsewhere, with rookie linebacker Carson Schwesinger piling up 156 tackles in a season.

Offensively, running back Quinshon Judkins had a strong rookie year — it also came with a domestic assault allegation that led to no charges — as did tight end Harold Fannin Jr. But nearly the entire starting offensive line is entering free agency, and the receiver group need major upgrading.

Defensive tackle Mason Graham, last year’s No. 5 pick, had some meh basic numbers but still projects to be a talented interior force.

Cleveland owns the No. 6 pick and a late-first via the Jaguars.

5. Arizona Cardinals (fired Jonathan Gannon)

Total: 13

QB situation (4): Give this a bump if you feel somewhere in your heart that Kyler Murray could return and a new coach could optimize him. That seems out of touch with reality, where a bridge has probably been burnt and at this point in his career, he is what he is.

Owning the No. 3 pick gives the Cardinals a shot to draft a quarterback if one of the Raiders or Jets gets the ick and, best-case, only one quarterback is off the board. That seems unlikely. Reality appears that Arizona would be taking the third quarterback off the board in a draft where even the top two options are shrug-worthy.

Jacoby Brissett is under contract and could be a bridge quarterback, whether or not Arizona drafts the future option.

Franchise stability (4): Ossenfort’s press conference explaining the firing of Gannon became a test to see if he could defend his drafting and roster-building duties that were, of course, undercut by the injury bug. He enters his fourth year with a roster that hasn’t seen drastic talent improvement in three years on the job.

Roster talent (5): In Ossenfort’s defense, the injury-hit youngsters could get healthy and back on track. That is where there’s a good chance the roster talent isn’t as bad as the other teams on this list. There are plenty of in-house options who will have an opportunity to take starting jobs at positions like cornerback, linebacker and along the defensive line.

Trey Benson at running back, wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. has shown enough flashes if you put his draft position aside and Michael Wilson shocked the league with a huge Year 3 leap. Josh Sweat made the big spending worth it at edge.

Draft to bulk up the offensive line, attack the WR market in free agency to be sure about the depth in that group and you can sell us on a competitive team returning.

But a coach taking this gig must understand he’s potentially living without a franchise quarterback for a year.

6. Las Vegas Raiders (fired Pete Carroll)

Total: 11

QB situation (5*): Big asterisk here. The QB situation could swing a couple different ways. Starting quarterback Geno Smith is under contract, and the numbers weren’t dreadful. But Las Vegas has the No. 1 pick, and you’d think that is used on a quarterback so long as the evaluators led by (certainly not minority owner Tom Brady) general manager John Spytek like the options of college QBs Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore.

If not, that is an unfortunate spot to be in.

Franchise stability (3): Aside from Jon Gruden’s 22-31 run from 2018-21, owner Mark Davis and the Raiders have not had a head coach last longer than three seasons since — scrolling, scrolling, scrolling — Jon Gruden in 1998-2001.

Roster talent (3): Is Maxx Crosby on this team next year? It would appear that the team ticked him off by shutting him down against his will to secure the No. 1 pick in the draft. Hopefully, that answers our question about whether they like a quarterback in this draft class.

There is some fun talent like tight end Brock Bowers (680 receiving yards, seven touchdowns) and rookie running back Ashton Jeanty (975 rushing yards, 10 total touchdowns). But the foundations in the trenches aren’t there.",https://cdn.arizonasports.com/arizonasports/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cardinals-monti-ossenfort-trade-deadline-e1761766974701.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:02:29.876426

With playoff matchups locked in, it’s important to understand who is hurt and who could be a surprise player behind them.

Let’s dive in.

NFL Wild Card Round Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers

Herbert sat out in Week 18, but this was mostly due to the game having little importance to the season. He’s expected to return to action against the Patriots.

NFL Wild Card Round Injury Report: Running Backs

Omarion Hampton, Los Angeles Chargers

Hampton sat out practice all week and was ultimately ruled out in Week 18. He will need to return to practice to return to the lineup this weekend, but should he return, he does have a tough matchup against a Patriots defense that has allowed the 5th least rushing yards per game amongst playoff teams. If he’s inactive, expect Kimani Vidal to step up in his place.

NFL Wild Card Round Injury Report: Wide Receivers

Rome Odunze, Chicago Bears

Rome was ultimately inactive against the Lions, but he did return to practice last week, and hopefully will return to action against Chicago. We’ll have to wait for more reports to be sure, but his rejoining the lineup should be a spark for the Chicago offense that struggled against Detroit.

Davante Adams, Los Angeles Rams

Adams is expected to return from his hamstring injury against the Panthers. His return to action will be appreciated by Stafford, who targeted Adams on 36 percent of his red zone throws.

Ricky Pearsall, San Francisco 49ers

Pearsall sat out in week 18, but it’s expected that this was mostly precautionary to help him get as healthy as possible for the playoffs. He’s currently expected to return to action, but we will monitor reports throughout the week.

NFL Wild Card Round Injury Report: Tight Ends

Terrance Ferguson, Los Angeles Rams

Ferguson has been dealing with a hamstring injury that caused him to be inactive this past week. Even if he returns to action, Tyler Higbee’s return plus Colby Parkinson make him a rotational piece at best at the current.

New England will host the Chargers at Gillette Stadium on Sunday, Jan. 11 at 8 p.m.","The New England Patriots’ 2025 regular season was a major success, and they managed to end it in style as well. Taking on the Miami Dolphins at Gillette Stadium, the team of head coach Mike Vrabel celebrated a 38-10 victory to secure the second seed in the AFC and set up a wild card playoff game against the Los Angeles Chargers next weekend.

That was not the only positive coming out of the contest, though. The Patriots also appear to have avoided any major injuries, and are therefore trending in the right direction with their first postseason game in four years coming up.

With that said, let’s assess the damage after rewatching the win over Miami.

ED K’Lavon Chaisson: With 12:46 left in the third quarter, the Patriots’ starting outside linebacker remained on the ground after a 9-yard run play. He was tended to by trainers on the field and slow to get up, but eventually walked off under his own power and into the blue medical tent. After a brief stay in the tent, he emerged and joined his teammates on the sidelines. Chaisson returned to the field on the next defensive series, having missed a total of two snaps. No injury status was announced by the team.

The Patriots had to deal with some injury woes recently, and were down four starter-level contributors against the Dolphins. Left guard Jared Wilson missed the game in concussion protocol; defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga is nursing a foot injury; edge defender Harold Landry is dealing with a knee issue; Robert Spillane has been out since early December because of an ankle injury.

The fact that the team emerged from its regular season finale relatively unscathed is therefore a definitive positive with the playoffs on the horizon. That said, Mike Vrabel did not provide much insight when talking about his team’s injury situation on Monday.

Mercogliano,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6944361/2026/01/06/rangers-shesterkin-injury-drury-trade-deadline-mammoth/,"Star goalie Igor Shesterkin was left writhing in pain after attempting to stop oncoming Utah Mammoth forward JJ Peterka.
Rangers coach Mike Sullivan was predictably vague following the 3-2 overtime loss, noting that Shesterkin was still undergoing tests.
“There are certain guys that drive your team,” Sullivan said.
He’s positioned to speak truth to Dolan about the hard changes needed to set the Rangers up for future success.
An extended Shesterkin absence may force the Rangers to accept that reality sooner than later.","NEW YORK — Roughly two hours after New York Rangers owner James Dolan went on local radio airwaves Monday and urged listeners, “Don’t give up on my team this year,” his club was dealt a potentially crippling blow.

Dolan made his way from WFAN’s Hudson Square studios up to Madison Square Garden, where he bore witness to a hold-your-breath injury involving arguably his most indispensable player.

Star goalie Igor Shesterkin was left writhing in pain after attempting to stop oncoming Utah Mammoth forward JJ Peterka. It initially looked like his right skate got caught and bent awkwardly, but when he was finally helped up by team trainer Andy Hosler and defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov, the 30-year-old wasn’t putting any weight on his left leg.

Rangers coach Mike Sullivan was predictably vague following the 3-2 overtime loss, noting that Shesterkin was still undergoing tests. But any lower-body injury in a non-contact situation is cause for concern.

“There are certain guys that drive your team,” Sullivan said. “He’s one of them for us. He’s an elite player at his position. I think he’s one of the very best in the game. When you lose a player like that for any length of time, those types of players are difficult to replace.”

This came on the heels of another fleeting feel-good moment for the Rangers (20-18-6), who opened the new year by defeating the two-time defending champion Florida Panthers in Friday’s Winter Classic. They hoped that would springboard them into a pivotal month on the NHL calendar — a 14-game stretch leading into February’s Olympic break, which league sources believe could sway team president Chris Drury’s trade deadline strategy.

“With every game that ticks off the calendar, games take on a higher level of importance, because the runway gets shorter,” Sullivan said following Sunday’s practice at the MSG Training Center. “We’re trying to maximize every opportunity we have in front of us.”

Shesterkin’s timeline will be a major influence, but there was already a strong case for the Rangers to consider taking advantage of a seller’s market. Dolan himself preached patience and sounded open to playing the long game, adding, “Culture doesn’t turn around overnight.”

There’s a prevalent narrative among New York fans that Dolan won’t accept anything less than a win-now approach, even if the on-ice evidence suggests these Rangers need to reset in the name of getting younger. But for better or worse, the evidence also points to Dolan keeping the faith in Drury.

He reiterated Monday what I’ve been hearing for months by adamantly affirming his faith in Drury. From what I gathered before the WFAN interview, the bubbling unrest from fans hasn’t put many — if any — chinks in that armor.

As someone recently reminded me, Dolan stood his ground when former team president Glen Sather went four straight seasons without a playoff berth at the beginning of his New York tenure from 2000-04. Public criticism and sporadic “Fire Sather” protests outside of MSG did little to shake that confidence.

Whether Drury has earned that level of security will be an ongoing source of debate, but with his job seemingly safe, the pressure to appease the owner with shortsighted moves should be lifted. He’s positioned to speak truth to Dolan about the hard changes needed to set the Rangers up for future success. (Even if that would, in turn, shine light on his own contributions to their recent downfall.)

A January rally could very well convince both owner and GM to mortgage that future and go for it one more time leading up to the March 6 deadline, but that would only serve as a facade for a team that’s earned just two regulation wins in its last 15 games. An extended Shesterkin absence may force the Rangers to accept that reality sooner than later.

Here are eight more thoughts from the Rangers’ 14th loss in 19 tries at MSG:

1. Jonathan Quick came off the bench 13 minutes into the game and held his own, stopping 14 of the 17 shots in faced. He’s cooled off after a hot start to the season, with an .875 save percentage or worse in four of his last five appearances. But his overall numbers — a .919 SV% and 2.11 goals-against average — remain encouraging.

The Rangers will likely recall 23-year-old Dylan Garand, who’s rebounded from a slow start with his best month of the season for AHL Hartford, but they’ve been reluctant to use him when previous NHL opportunities arose. With Quick’s 40th birthday approaching later this month, we’re about to find out just how much they can lean on the grizzled veteran.

“He’s still an excellent goalie,” Sullivan said. “He’s one of the leaders in that room for good reason. His body of work in this league speaks for itself. If you ask my opinion, I think he’s first-ballot Hall of Famer with what he’s accomplished in the game. But he loves the game and he loves to compete. He’s very capable.”

2. Quick was short while answering postgame questions, with that frustration showing on multiple occasions during the game when he went after Utah players for bumping him or crashing into the net. Asked if he thought the Mammoth crossed the line compared to other teams, Quick left it at this: “It’s a good question. I’ll think on it.”

3. Sullivan didn’t seem as bothered by Utah going to the net as he was by his own team not doing enough of it.

“When you go to the net hard, sometimes there’s incidental contact,” he said. “I think we could go to the net hard. I think it’s an important aspect of scoring goals. You look at the majority of the goals and how they’re scored around the league, and there’s a fair amount of them that are within three feet of the blue paint.”

4. Sullivan also didn’t sound pleased about a third period in which the Rangers let a 2-1 lead slip away and managed only three shots on goal with zero high-danger scoring chances, according to Natural Stat Trick.

“The first half of the period, I didn’t think we played with the level of intensity that we needed to,” he said. “Our challenge is to find a way to bring that consistently. I mean, it’s a game of momentum. Sometimes teams are going to get it. You’re going to get on your heels, but it can’t be for extended periods. We’ve got to do a better job with pushback.”

5. A bright spot for New York was a power play that’s caught fire since Adam Fox rejoined the lineup three games ago. The Rangers scored twice more Monday, starting with Alexis Lafrenière’s tap-in goal on a good net-front feed from Mika Zibanejad at the 8:29 mark of the second period, followed by Vincent Trocheck tipping in an Artemi Panarin wrister a little over eight minutes later.

At that point, the Rangers were a scorching 5-for-6 since Fox’s return, but it was a failure to convert in the third period that stuck with them. Zibanejad hit the post on a tough-angle one-timer, but the full two minutes didn’t feel nearly as threatening.

“They stayed a lot tighter in the last one,” Trocheck said. “It seemed like they were giving us more time to the outside.”

6. Urho Vaakanainen returned to the lineup following eight healthy scratches in the previous nine games and had a rough go at it. He got turned around and beat to the outside on Michael Carcone’s goal, which tied the score at 2-2 with 13:45 left in regulation, and finished with a 38.74 percent expected goals-for rate.

His appearance came at the expense of Matthew Robertson, who had played in the previous 25 straight. The guess here is that Robertson will slot back in when the Buffalo Sabres visit MSG on Thursday.

“Sometimes it’s good for young defensemen to watch a game from above and gain the benefit of a certain perspective or vantage point that might be part of the learning process,” Sullivan said before the game. “But ultimately, at the end of the day, we’re going to try to put the best six guys in the lineup that are going to help us win.”

7. Sullivan has shown confidence in Robertson this season, but a couple of young forwards are struggling to gain trust. That’s been obvious with Brennan Othmann, who’s been limited to six appearances and hasn’t logged more than 10:43 time on ice in any of the last five. And it’s become increasingly clear with Brett Berard, who played only 7:27 in the Winter Classic and came right back out of the lineup Monday.

Sullivan explained his reasoning following Sunday’s practice, noting that he values veteran Justin Dowling because he prefers dressing more than four forwards who are capable of playing center. He also inserted Anton Blidh for his “disruptive” forechecking skills. Neither logged more than 7:53 against Utah, though, highlighting the puzzling decision to play a couple over-30 AHLers over prospects the organization once viewed as budding NHL contributors. The fact that Othmann and Berard remain on the outside while J.T. Miller, Adam Edström, Noah Laba and Conor Sheary are all hurt is even more telling.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/06000230/USATSI_27938310-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-06 12:02:02.028912

The final game of the season was decided on a field goal that sailed wide right, eliminating the kicking team from the playoffs.

Those two games represented the bookends to another chaotic regular season of football, which — as usual — featured some shocking results. After finishing in last place in their divisions in 2024, both the New England Patriots and Chicago Bears won their respective divisions in 2025. Lamar Jackson, Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow — mainstays in the playoffs — had their seasons ended early thanks to injuries and poor luck.

Those factors should ensure quite an entertaining postseason. But before those games start, there's still a few things left to figure out. The Atlanta Falcons got in front of every other team Sunday, when it fired both head coach Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot.

The Cleveland Browns didn't wait much longer, firing Kevin Stefanski on Monday. Then, the Raiders were soon to follow, firing Pete Carroll just one season into his three-year contract. The Arizona Cardinals went down that same path, axing Jonathan Gannon on Monday after three seasons.

They won't be the only ones to go. Which coaches and general managers will get the axe before the playoffs begin? And which players will return to action as their teams prepare for the stretch run?

Reporters approached Tagovailoa at his locker Monday, and the veteran quarterback said that he ""would be good with"" a new opportunity elsewhere. The reporters made sure that he understood the question was about a fresh start with a team other than the Dolphins, according to the Miami Herald,. Tagovailoa said he understood but declined to comment further.

""That would be dope,"" Tagovailoa said of the potential to start 2026 anew.

Tagovailoa ceded the starting job in Week 16 after he set a new career highs in interceptions (15) and sacks (30) and posted the lowest QBR of his six-year run in Miami. Although he helped spark a late-season turnaround in which the Dolphins won four consecutive games, he went just 6-8 as the starter and turned in his first losing record.

The low points for Tagovailoa were abnormally dramatic. His season reached an impasse in October when he threw three interceptions in a loss to the Los Angeles Chargers and tossed three more the following week in a 31-6 drubbing at the hands of the Cleveland Browns.

Miami has seen Tagovailoa at his best, though, and could reinsert him into the lineup in 2026 if it feels he is capable of returning to elite form. The former No. 5 overall pick led the NFL in completion percentage in 2024 and was the league's passing leader in 2023. He also paced the NFL in yards per attempt in 2022. All of that is to say Tagovailoa is not far removed from performing like one of the top quarterbacks in the league.

Moving on from Tagovailoa entirely would come with its challenges. The Dolphins inked their franchise quarterback to a four-year, $212.4 million contract extension in July 2024 and guaranteed him $167 million. He is under contract through 2028 and carries a $56.4 million cap hit in 2026. Releasing Tagovailoa is likely off the table, so the Dolphins would need to find a trade partner willing to take on his sizable salary.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/05/d0a3b0df-9dae-4c80-9599-d5888f77e619/thumbnail/1200x675/237b04c63372aa573ae8c560ff0cee7b/gettyimages-2253019195-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 05:58:09.407555

City confirmed the Croatia international will undergo surgery later this week, the results of which would give the full extent of the diagnosis and potential timeframe for absence.

Earlier on Monday, City recalled centre-back Max Alleyne from his season-long loan at Watford after Pep Guardiola said on Sunday that Gvardiol and team-mate Ruben Dias could miss time with injury.

Dias and Gvardiol were substituted in the second half of City’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea on Sunday. Gvardiol was replaced in the 51st minute by Abdukodir Khusanov after a collision with Chelsea full-back Malo Gusto and had to be helped off the pitch, while Dias was substituted 30 minutes later.

This adds to City’s issues in defence, with John Stones sidelined with a thigh injury sustained in early December. Nathan Ake has only been used sparingly after undergoing foot surgery last season, making just two Premier League starts this campaign.

Due to City’s defensive issues, they have recalled the 20-year-old Alleyne from his loan spell in the Championship. The City youth graduate made 17 appearances for the second division side.

Alleyne has represented England at every youth level from under-17 to under-21, and was an unused substitute for City’s first team on seven occasions last season, including in the Premier League and Club World Cup.

At his post-match press conference on Sunday, Guardiola did not put a timeframe on Gvardiol and Dias’ injuries but added that both are likely to miss time.

“We will see tomorrow (about the extent of Gvardiol’s injury), but it doesn’t look good for him or Ruben,” Guardiola said, via the City website. “I didn’t speak with the doctor but if Ruben is out, it is because he felt something.

“Of course, we have a lot (of injuries). John Stones is missing for many months; Ruben will be out and Josko will be out. Always we know with Nathan (Ake) that he cannot play regularly. After what happened last season, if we stay strong, we will find a solution and the spirit will be there.”

When asked if Dias had sustained a muscle injury, Guardiola said: “Yes, it looks like it.”

Khusanov, who missed almost two months himself earlier in the season with an ankle injury, is now a candidate to see an increase in game time, having made just seven starts in all competitions this campaign.

The Eagles won that game, 31-7, before falling to the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII. In that game, the 49ers were decimated at quarterback as Brock Purdy and Josh Johnson suffered injuries.

After Johnson exited, Purdy returned to the game in the third quarter, but he was unable to throw the football beyond a few yards. The injuries to San Francisco's quarterbacks led to the NFL approving a rule change that allows teams to play an emergency quarterback if the starter and backup are injured.

The Eagles are 1-1 vs. San Francisco all-time in the playoffs. Philadelphia's loss to the 49ers in the playoffs happened in the wild-card round in 1996.

The title game in the 2022 season between the Eagles and 49ers started a rivalry that boiled over into 2023.

In 2023, the 49ers traveled to Lincoln Financial Field in Week 13 and dominated the Eagles, 42-19. The loss started the infamous collapse for the Eagles to end the season as the Birds lost six of the final seven games, including the playoff exit vs. the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The loss to the Niners in the 2023 season also featured Eagles security chief Dom DiSandro and then-49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw being ejected from the game after a scuffle on the sideline.

The Eagles and 49ers haven't played each other since the 2023 season.

How the Eagles and 49ers got here

The Eagles went 11-6 in the 2025 season and won the NFC East for the second consecutive year, which ended a 20-year stretch of the division not having a repeat winner.

The Niners had a chance to earn the No. 1 seed, but fell to the Seattle Seahawks Saturday night. The 49ers finished the year with a 12-5 record to earn the No. 6 seed.

Eagles-49ers injury report

While the Eagles didn't get the No. 2 seed, they rested most of their starters in hopes of getting healthier heading into the playoffs.

All-Pro right tackle Lane Johnson hasn't played since Week 11 vs. the Detroit Lions, but he's reportedly expected to return for the playoffs.

Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter likely wasn't going to play in the regular season finale, but he popped up on the injury report with a hip injury before Week 18. Linebacker Nakobe Dean has also missed the last two weeks with a hamstring injury.

The 49ers are dealing with several notable injuries heading into the playoffs.

San Francisco is missing star linebacker Fred Warner, who suffered an ankle injury in Week 6, heading into the wild-card round. Niners head coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters that Warner is progressing but not expected to make a return until later in the playoffs if the team advances.

To make matters worse, the Niners lost linebacker Tatum Bethune, who was filling in for Warner, to a season-ending groin injury over the weekend in the Week 18 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. The 49ers are already without top pass rusher Nick Bosa, who tore his ACL early in the season.

On the offensive side of the ball for the Niners, Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams missed Week 18 with a hamstring injury, while wide receiver Ricky Pearsall didn't play due to right knee and ankle injuries.

Shanahan told reporters Monday that Williams and Pearsall will be evaluated later in the week.

On Sunday, while resting Christian Benford and Taron Johnson, Buffalo had no choice but to leave rookie Maxwell Hairston in the game what we now know was too long.

Midway through the fourth quarter of Buffalo’s 35-8 win over the New York Jets, Hairston left the game with an ankle injury. The Bills’ first-round draft pick from the 2025 NFL Draft was seen making his way slowly to the locker room with members of Buffalo’s training staff and was declared doubtful to return with an ankle injury. After the game, there were reports that Hairston was seen in a walking boot.

The rookie missed the first seven weeks of the season after suffering a knee injury in training camp that landed him on Injured Reserve. Once Hairston returned, he has split playing time with Tre’Davious White or started in place of Christian Benford. In his eleven games played, he recorded 18 combined tackles (14 solo), 5 passes defended, and two interceptions.

Buffalo really can’t afford to have the speedster sidelined if they are making a push to still be playing football in February.

Utah forward JJ Peterka drove to the net in hopes of scoring a loose puck and made marginal contact with Shesterkin. The goalie went sprawling into his own net and slammed the ice in pain with his blocker. Shesterkin stayed down for an extended period as trainer Andy Hosler came to attend to him. Eventually, Hosler and Vladislav Gavrikov helped Shesterkin off the ice. The goalie did not appear to put any weight on his left leg, which is not a part of the body Peterka collided with. Shesterkin had to be helped to the dressing room after leaving the ice. Jonathan Quick entered the game in his place.

New York has had a difficult start to the season, going 20-18-5 through its first 43 games. Shesterkin, though, has been consistent in net. He has a .912 save percentage and has stopped 22.63 goals above expected, per Evolving-Hockey. That ranks fourth in the league. He is in the first year of an eight-year, $11.5 million average annual value contract.

The Rangers have already been without Vincent Trocheck, Adam Fox and J.T. Miller for prolonged stretches this season. If Shesterkin misses significant time, it would likely mark a bigger loss than any other player.

Quick has been solid in limited action this season, going 3-6-1 with a .924 save percentage, but he is 39 and best served as a No. 2 goalie at this point.

Starting Saturday, 14 teams will battle it out for the right to play in Super Bowl LX on Feb 8. And with perennial playoff teams like the Chiefs, Vikings, Lions and Ravens out of the picture, new contenders like the Bears, Texans and Jaguars will get their shot. Then there are the Patriots, a franchise that knows something about winning titles yet was one of the biggest surprises of the 2025 season.

Are any of those teams better than the No. 1-seeded Broncos and Seahawks? Let's see where all 14 playoff teams rank headed into Wild Card Weekend.

Entering the playoffs with a sub-.500 record and a two-game losing streak makes it hard to consider Bryce Young & Co. a legitimate threat in the postseason tournament. Although the Panthers have some impressive wins on their résumé, their overall inconsistency makes them a one-and-done candidate in the playoffs.

Aaron Rodgers’ Week 18 heroics give Mike Tomlin and the Steelers a chance to atone for recent playoff failures. Although the Steelers’ flaws make it hard to envision an extended playoff run, their gritty demeanor and competitiveness give them a shot at taking down a more talented squad.

Despite fading badly down the stretch due to injuries and faulty execution, the Packers have enough talent to make a surprising playoff run. Quarterback Jordan Love is an elite talent with enough playmakers around him to light up the scoreboard in a carefully scripted shootout. Although the Packers’ injury-ravaged squad enters the playoffs on a four-game losing streak, the NFC’s No. 7 seed is dangerous in a single-elimination tournament.

Jim Harbaugh’s enigmatic squad is capable of making a deep postseason run, but its success hinges on the play of a decimated offensive line. Without a blue-chip frontline blocker available to deal with the bullies in the trenches, the Chargers will need quarterback Justin Herbert to play at an MVP level to navigate a very competitive AFC field.

Second-year QB Caleb Williams’ late-game magic and the defense’s takeaway prowess give the Bears a chance to knock off a heavyweight in the postseason. Though Ben Johnson would prefer to control the game with a punishing rushing attack led by D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai, the Bears can win grind-it-out affairs or shootouts in the playoffs.

After going all-out in an attempt to claim the No. 1 seed, San Francisco might lack the depth to make a deep playoff run. Without their core defensive stars, the 49ers are forced to rely extensively on their offense to control the game. While Kyle Shanahan’s whiteboard wizardry will test opposing defenses, the 49ers will need defensive coordinator Robert Saleh to craft a masterpiece or two to help them advance through the tournament.

Reigning MVP Josh Allen will need to utilize all of his superpowers to lead the Bills on a Super Bowl run. With NFL rushing champ James Cook capable of alleviating some of the pressure, the Bills could lean on a ground-and-pound approach to control the action against more talented squads. As Sean McDermott contemplates how to maximize his opportunity to win a Super Bowl with Patrick Mahomes, Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow out of the running, Buffalo's head coach will need to rely on the Bills’ offensive firepower to get it done.

The defending champs have not played their best football, but they are the most talented team in the field, with a championship pedigree that gives them a significant advantage in high-stakes games. Jalen Hurts has mastered mistake-free football, but the Eagles might need their QB1 to transform from game manager to game changer in the playoffs. With power rusher Jalen Carter and an ultra-talented defense capable of holding opponents to 20 points or fewer, the Eagles could be the last team standing when the confetti falls at the end of Super Bowl LX.

The stingiest defense in the league could spark a Super Bowl run for the Texans. The swarming unit overwhelms opponents with a ferocious pass rush and sticky coverage, leading to three-and-outs and game-changing turnovers. Although the Texans’ pedestrian offense struggles to put points on the board, the defense can make life miserable for opponents by forcing them to play ugly games that lack rhythm and flow.

Despite their record and wild-card status, the Rams are arguably the best team in the tournament. Sean McVay has Matthew Stafford playing at an MVP level, while maintaining a balanced offensive approach that doesn’t put the game solely on the veteran QB's shoulders. Defensively, the Rams can overwhelm opponents with their collective speed and athleticism on the perimeter and their brute strength in the trenches. With the league’s best tactician and schemer leading the way, the Rams are the team to fear in the tournament.

After shocking the football world with 14 wins in Mike Vrabel’s debut season, the Patriots are poised to make a deep playoff run behind an MVP-caliber quarterback thriving in his second NFL season. While Drake Maye’s success as an efficient playmaker has transformed the Patriots’ offense into a juggernaut, the questions persist regarding whether the production is sustainable against elite opponents. With a high-profile postseason game on the horizon, the football world will quickly find out if the young quarterback and his squad are built to handle the playoff pressure.

Locking up the No. 1 seed gives the Broncos a clear path to Super Bowl LX. With Sean Payton’s championship experience and expertise helping Denver acclimate to an ultra-competitive environment, the 14-win team should be prepared to handle the win-or-go-home pressure that makes some teams wilt in the postseason.

The disrespect heaped on the small-market Jaguars has fueled their unexpected emergence as a title contender. First-year coach Liam Coen has played his motivational cards perfectly to elevate his squad’s performance while coaxing MVP-caliber play from Trevor Lawrence. While the football world wonders if the clock will strike midnight on Cinderella in the wild-card round, the big-play quarterback and turnover-obsessed defense could lead to a surprising run that silences the naysayers.

Mike Macdonald has built a title contender with the key ingredients: dominant defense, rugged running game and clutch quarterback play. Despite questions regarding Sam Darnold’s big-game ability, the veteran QB delivered when it mattered for the Seahawks down the stretch in the regular season. With the ""12s"" creating a raucous environment and significant home-field advantage, the Seahawks should be prohibitive favorites to represent the NFC in Super Bowl LX.

LSU fifth-year senior quarterback Garrett Nussmeier can virtually make up for his lost season of 2025 because of a painful abdomen tear injury with one week of practice and/or one game during Senior Bowl week in Mobile, Alabama, from Jan. 26-31.

Nussmeier has agreed to practice and play in the premier NFL pre-draft game, the Senior Bowl announced on Monday. Virtually every NFL general manager, head coach and personnel directors will descend on Mobile.

After injuring his abdomen last August, Nussmeier dealt with the injury for most of his season through nine games, and it showed before he basically opted out, understandably, of the Tigers’ final three regular season games and third-tier Texas Bowl.

In 2024, Nussmeier shot up the NFL draft boards to a high first round pick and potentially the first quarterback to go before a late-season swoon dropped him. But had he declared for the 2025 NFL Draft, he likely would have still been a first round choice. As his 2025 season floundered along with his passes, Nussmeier now finds himself likely falling into the second round.

He is currently the No. 7 quarterback on Mel Kiper’s ESPN list. With impressive showings at the Senior owl and LSU’s Pro Day in the spring, and the NFL Combine in February, if invited, he could rise, kdepending where his abdomen injury is.

LSU safety AJ Haulcy, wide receiver Barion Brown and defensive end Jack Pyburn were previous invitees to the Senior Bowl from the Tigers’ 2025 team.

In 13 games in 2024, Nussmeier completed 337 of 525 passes (64.2 percent) for 4,052 yards (5th in the nation) and 29 touchdowns (10th nationally) with 12 interceptions when healthy and with an offensive line that put four members into the 2025 NFL Draft. His 311.7 yards passing a game for a team that finished 107th in the nation in rushing with 116.4 yards a game.

In nine games in 2025, Nussmeier completed 194 of 288 passes (67.4 percent) for 1,927 yards and 12 touchdowns with five interceptions for a 133.8 efficiency rating. He averaged 214.1 passing yards a game with an even worse running game than the previous season – 124th nationally with 104 yards a game.

“I can’t un-see what I saw in 2024,” new Senior Bowl executive director Drew Fabianich told Tiger Rag on Monday. “So there has to be the why.”

Fabianich was a Dallas Cowboys national scout for 14 years while with Dallas from 2003 through 2021. He is also a former general manager at Auburn (2022-23) and at West Virginia (2023-24) and was the defensive coordinator at Louisiana-Monroe from 1997-2000.

“There has to be an explanation,” Fabianich said. “That difference in the two seasons doesn’t just happen over night.”",https://www.tigerrag.com/wp-content/uploads/LSUFootballVsTexasAM2025_GarrettNussmeier1_JMailhes.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 02:59:02.329986

""I think as long as we have Lamar Jackson, I feel like this team can win a Super Bowl,"" Pro Bowl fullback Patrick Ricard said during the Ravens' locker cleanout Monday. ""I guess the biggest thing is he makes this thing go.""

In an injury-filled season in which he missed four games, Jackson finished with a losing record (6-7) for the first time in his eight-year career, totaling his fewest passing yards (2,549) and touchdown passes (21) since 2022. He also recorded a career-low 349 yards rushing.

But, in Sunday night's 26-24 loss at the Pittsburgh Steelers, Jackson nearly carried Baltimore to the AFC North title with a comeback victory. He became the second player in NFL history to throw two go-ahead touchdowns of 50-plus yards in the fourth quarter, joining the Jaguars' David Garrard in 2010.

""Right before we went out [in the fourth quarter], and he's like, 'Let's be legendary,'"" Ravens offensive tackle Roger Rosengarten said. ""That's exactly what he did. He's the best in the NFL.""

Through the first three quarters, Jackson was 5-of-10 for 66 yards with one touchdown and one interception. In the fourth quarter, he completed 6 of 8 passes for 172 yards with touchdown throws of 64 and 50 yards to wide receiver Zay Flowers.

The Ravens have work to do with Jackson this offseason. His salary cap figure soars to $74.5 million, which accounts for 25% of Baltimore's 2026 salary cap. The team will likely need to get a new contract with Jackson to reduce that cap hit.

Asked whether he feels he will remain with the Ravens amid looming contract talks, Jackson said, ""We just lost a game -- a divisional game -- a game to put us in the playoffs.

Surgery to repair a damaged AC joint could sideline a thrower for anywhere from six to nine months.","Titans quarterback Cam Ward does not believe he will need surgery for his sprained AC joint.

Ward suffered the right shoulder injury during the season finale against Jacksonville.

The rookie will focus on rehabilitation during the offseason to heal the injury.

Tennessee Titans quarterback Cam Ward told reporters on Jan. 5 that he doesn't think he'll need surgery to repair the sprained AC joint in his right throwing shoulder, which he injured in the Titans' season finale on Jan. 4.

""Just really heal,"" Ward said when asked what the prescription is for how he should handle the injury through the offseason. ""Talked with the trainers. I’ll probably have some rehabbing. Then you just continue to try to get stronger on my shoulder and try to get ready for next year.""

Ward exited the Titans' 41-7 loss against Jacksonville after the team's first offensive series. He rushed in for a touchdown from 7 yards out, lunging over the goal line and landing awkwardly between the football and a diving Jaguars defender.

Ward headed to the locker room shortly thereafter for X-rays and was ruled out for the rest of the game within the half-hour. He returned to the sideline for the second half sporting a sling supporting his right arm and shoulder.

One day later, Ward says he didn't feel or hear a pop in his shoulder. He just sensed soreness. His mind raced through all the possibilities; his first instinct was there was ""too much (expletive) in his head"" all at once. He wanted to get the X-rays done as quickly as possible in hope he'd be able to return to the game.

Ward said he has not been given a timetable yet for when he'll be cleared for football activities.

Cam Ward injury: What's next?

Ward heads into an offseason where rehab has to be the focus. He finished his rookie season with 3,169 yards passing, 15 touchdowns and seven interceptions. He played his best football in December, going on a stretch of four consecutive games with multiple touchdowns as the Titans scored 24 or more points in all four games.

The initial diagnosis on Ward's injury seemed to indicate surgery was likely, with a source telling The Tennessean after the game that the expectation was the injury was ""significant."" Surgery to repair a damaged AC joint could sideline a thrower for anywhere from six to nine months. But with rehab, the process to return should be quicker.

""There is relief for myself and the building,"" Ward said. ""The training staff, they get it right. Continue to walk me through the process of what I need to do to get better and get back on the field.""

Neither Ward nor interim Titans coach Mike McCoy directly ruled out the possibility of surgery, but both indicated that surgery wasn't the likely path at the moment.

As for pain management, Ward answered like a football player.

When asked how the pain of injuring his shoulder compared to other pains experienced on the football field, Ward said: ""I got up off the field, so I was fine.""","https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/04/PNAS/88019288007-usatsi-27930763.jpg?crop=4342,2443,x0,y226&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-06 01:58:38.908180

With an extra week to prepare, thanks to a Bye Week for being the NFC's No. 1 seed, Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald is ""still optimistic"" to get players back from injury and potential injured reserve as well.

Tackle Charles Cross has missed the past three games dealing with a hamstring injury and safety Coby Bryant missed the last two with a knee injury. Neither were placed on injured reserve, which is a good sign they have a chance to return.

Macdonald said, ""I haven't gotten the update on the guys that have been out, but the timetable is still the way we said it at the end of last week where we're still optimistic to have them back either during practice this week or sometime next week.""

At the end last week, Macdonald said three of the players currently on injured reserve, running back George Holani, tight end Eljah Arroyo and linebacker Chazz Surratt all have a chance to return in the playoffs.

The defense was dominant once again.

Seattle's defense held San Francisco to just 173 total yards, the lowest total in nine seasons under Kyle Shanahan, in large part because of their ability to limit explosive plays. 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy didn't attempt a pass of 20 yards or more and completed just four passes anywhere from 10-19 yards.

The defense also held running back Christian McCaffrey to just 23 rushing yards on the night, his lowest total since the 2020 season.

""One of the things that I think we're most proud of, of our defensive tape, is the waves of football, waves of Seahawks that get to the ball,"" Macdonald said. ""And what that does is it allows you to take really aggressive angles. So, I don't feel like I'm just playing by myself out there. And so I feel like our team is really committed to playing in that type of style and that type of speed and that type of effort. And when you do that, you might miss a tackle here or there, but it's going to get cleaned up and you're going to get multiple people at the point of attack where you can limit some of those extra hidden yardages.""

The run game had another great game.

For the third game in a row, Seattle's run game has been the most productive it's been all season. On Saturday, Kenneth Walker III and Zach Charbonnet rushed for a combined 171 yards on 33 carries. Walker also surpassed 1,000 yards on the season for the second time in his career. Along with the Seahawks simply sticking to being committed to making the run game work, Macdonald said the coaches also have a better idea of the amount of information they are able to coach the player up on.

""I think we have a better idea of how much we can handle on a week-to-week basis. How many runs can we carry? How many different types of runs? How many different formations can we build it out of? Kind of like how much you put on your quarterback's plate defensively too. It's like, how much stuff can we bring into a game, where we have the right balance of answers and enough scheme to really let us give us an advantage or we feel like it is an advantage. And then there's a balance of that of how much can you actually execute given the amount of reps throughout the week. So I think that's been something that we've kind of chiseled the way at throughout the year and really throughout maybe the last month, probably since the Bye (Week), honestly, or coming out of the Thursday game. I feel like we really had a better understanding of what that balance is.""

The Seahawks also became the only team to have successful four successful runs on third-and-15 or longer. This week it was Walker with a 19-yard run on a third-and-17 in the third quarter to keep the drive alive.

""That's a 12 As One play,"" Macdonald said. ""I mean, everybody hit their targets, they hit their blocks. And then my favorite part of the play is (Jake) Bobo and Jax (Jaxon Smith-Njigba) celebrating more than anybody else. Two receivers on a third and long who got their guys blocked and springing the run that got Ken the first down. It was a heck of a run by Ken, but there's a lot of great blocking going on that play. And then to see the guys celebrate like that for the success of the team and their teammate was really cool.""

Keeping the same mindset through the playoffs.

Yes, they're preparing for a playoff game, but Macdonald has stressed, all season, the importance of, ""sticking to the process"" and that's what Seattle will being doing when they head into the week.

""Part of our message to our guys is, I know we're going to the playoffs, but nothing changes in terms of our preparation, our mentality,"" he said. ""It's the same thing that circumstances around the game people are going to be talking about, but for us, the things that we need to be able to do to be able to have success is going to stay the same.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/dekijfjexahw68zycpsf,N,,2026-01-05 23:59:11.496135

Every Monday, we will bring you information and analysis on the biggest talking points, cutting through the noisy world of all things Barca with reporting you can trust.

The information contained in this article reflects multiple conversations with various sources at the Spanish champions, all of whom wanted to speak anonymously to protect relationships.

What’s the biggest talking point at Barcelona right now?

Barcelona passed a difficult test, beating Espanyol at the RCDE Stadium with their city rivals in top form. After ending 2025 with five straight league wins, Manolo Gonzalez’s side are fifth in La Liga and made the game as difficult as possible.

Barca were crowned La Liga champions on their previous two visits to the ground (in 2023 and 2025). On the first occasion, the derby also saw Espanyol relegated to the second division.

That has fuelled a tense rivalry — taken to new levels by goalkeeper Joan Garcia’s move across town in the summer — but Barca’s 2-0 win strengthened their lead at the top of La Liga.

While they have struggled at times this season, Hansi Flick’s side have more points than at this stage last year. After matchday 19 of the previous campaign, Barca were third with 38 points, five behind Real Madrid in second and six behind leaders Atletico Madrid. They are leading the table with 49 points now, four ahead of Real Madrid.

Now, they travel to Saudi Arabia to play in the Supercopa de Espana, a competition they won last season as part of a domestic treble. In recent seasons, the Supercopa has been a barometer for the rest of the season in Spain — since 2022, the team that has won it has gone on to lift La Liga. Barca face Athletic Club in the semi-final on Wednesday, with a potential final against Atletico Madrid or Real Madrid to follow on Sunday.

Another issue that is beginning to gain traction is what Barca do in the January transfer market: will they use Andreas Christensen’s injury to make a new signing?

Sporting director Deco told Cadena Ser radio last month that Barca would not make any signings in the winter window as they do not tend to work out. But, following the centre-back’s long-term knee injury and the uncertainties around Ronald Araujo’s return (more of which below), the club are looking into the possibility of strengthening their defence.

What did we learn from Saturday’s game?

That this Barcelona team can win while not necessarily being at their best.

“To be honest, we didn’t deserve it,” was Flick’s post-match assessment. The team did not gel in midfield and Pedri, who came on in the 64th minute on his return from a muscle injury, cut a frustrated figure.

Another issue was Raphinha not quite working in attacking midfield. The Brazil winger cannot turn and accelerate in central areas in the same way as Dani Olmo or Fermin Lopez, and it seemed clear his best position remains on the wing.

But we also learned Garcia is here to stay as Barca’s No 1 and can make history at the club. Some voices within Barca have even said, “We have our own Thibaut Courtois” in reference to the 24-year-old.

His saves kept Barca in the game against his old team. It came against a backdrop of genuine hostility towards him. Every time Garcia touched the ball, he was met with deafening whistles and insults, while Espanyol fans held up banners with rats drawn on them.

That he was able to keep a cool head in such a hostile environment provided further proof that Barca did the right thing in signing him (not that it was needed).

The feeling within the club is he could become a Barcelona legend.

Will Barcelona make a move this January transfer window?

Flick is very keen on signing a new defender. The club are exploring what players are available this month, but it is far from a simple situation.

“When we look at our defensive line, I think we need one more player,” the German manager said in his pre-Espanyol press conference on Friday. “It’s something we need to talk about, but it is not easy to get a player of this level in winter.

“I am confident we can do something, but it has to make sense.”

Barcelona have a big problem in defence after Christensen was sidelined for months. Araujo has just returned to train with the first team after being given indefinite leave with the club’s agreement, but there is still no timeframe on his return. He was included in their squad for the Supercopa de Espana but is not expected to play.

All of this leaves Barca with just five defenders — Jules Kounde, Eric Garcia, Pau Cubarsi, Gerard Martin and Alejandro Balde — to cover four positions. One of those, Garcia, is being used in midfield.

The challenge now is to find something that makes sense given the reservations Deco mentioned about the January transfer market.

The sporting director’s top priority was to sign a centre-back in the summer, but the names they were monitoring — such as Crystal Palace’s Marc Guehi and Nico Schlotterbeck of Borussia Dortmund — are not currently for sale. It is also unclear as to whether Barca have the finances for a deal of that size.

Barca remain in a tight position with their La Liga-imposed salary limit, but Christensen’s injury does give them options. As the Denmark international is expected to be out for more than four months, the Catalans could use the long-term injury exception in La Liga’s rulebook to use 80 per cent of his salary space to register a new signing.

But bear in mind that there is a deadline for this. According to the league’s rules, every club that intends to use this exception must notify La Liga at most 25 days after the player is injured. Christensen’s injury happened on December 20, which means Barca need to tell La Liga if they want to register a new signing in his place by January 14.

In an ideal world, Deco would like an experienced player to join on loan until the end of the season to provide depth and competition.

One player liked within Barca’s sporting department is Manchester City’s Nathan Ake. But it is seen as unlikely that City will be open to letting him go on loan until the end of the season without the possibility of a permanent sale. Following injuries to Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias, that option seems even more remote, and City do not envisage letting him go at this point.

A player who has been offered to the club in recent days is Joao Cancelo. The Portugal international is expected to leave Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal this month and would be very keen on re-joining Barca following his loan spell there in the 2023-24 season.

Right-back Cancelo is not the central defender Flick wants, which means the 31-year-old is not seen as the most sensible option, according to club sources.

What might we have missed? What should we look out for?

Araujo’s return happened during the club’s open training session, which Barcelona hold every year around Christmastime. The Uruguayan received a warm welcome from supporters.

After Barca’s Champions League defeat by Chelsea in early December, Araujo asked the club for indefinite leave, a request which was granted. He has not trained nor played since then, although he has been working with a physical trainer who has helped him stay in shape.

He decided to return after the holidays, with club sources saying he may not yet be physically ready to return to the pitch and needs to train more with the group.

“It’s up to him,” Flick said, when asked when he could return to the team. “He’s fine now, physically he may not be 100 per cent, but he’s fine. Besides, it’s up to him to decide how quickly he’s going to come back.”

Araujo will continue to gain match fitness with the squad at the Supercopa.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/05075855/InsideBarca.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-05 23:00:01.892486

So the Lions placed him on injured reserve, and LaPorta got the surgery.
“Hopefully by OTAs I’m up running around, and then, of course, we’ll be in pads in training camp,” LaPorta said.
You just have to assume that you’re going to make it through the game healthy and you’re going to give your best effort every week when you go out,” LaPorta said.
“I was very happy with how I was playing in my third season,” LaPorta said.","There’s been a little mystery surrounding Detroit Lions tight end Sam LaPorta’s back injury that cost him the final eight games of the season. All we’ve really heard is that it required season-ending surgery, and the 2023 second-round pick is expected to be ready by training camp in 2026.

On locker room cleanout day, LaPorta spoke to the media for the first time since the surgery and gave a little more background on what happened. According to LaPorta, he sustained an accumulation of falls and hits in games leading up to the Washington Commanders game in Week 10, but in that game alone, that’s when one of his vertebrae discs “fully herniated.”

“Numbness and tingling and muscle loss–it happened shortly after that,” LaPorta said. “When you can’t do a single-leg calf raise, it’s kinda hard to play football. So that’s kind of where we were at.”

Initially, LaPorta was hoping it was on the minor end of these types of injuries. Sometimes, they can take just a couple weeks to feel better, sometimes it’s closer to a couple months. In extreme cases, it requires surgery, and, unfortunately, after a couple weeks of not improving, the team and LaPorta agreed that he fell into the last category. So the Lions placed him on injured reserve, and LaPorta got the surgery.

“Backs aren’t anything to mess with, and I want to have a long, healthy career, so it was the best route,” LaPorta said.

It’s now been six weeks since the procedure, and LaPorta is excited about the new phase of rehab he’ll be starting this week. He confirmed coach Dan Campbell’s target of being ready by training camp this upcoming offseason.

“Hopefully by OTAs I’m up running around, and then, of course, we’ll be in pads in training camp,” LaPorta said. “So, it’s a lot different than other sports, just to be able to brace for those hits, and the accumulation of a long NFL season, I’ve really got to get this back right before I’m out there running around in pads and taking those hits and such.”

LaPorta said this ordeal—the first major injury of his athletic career—won’t necessarily change how he plays the game. While it’s obviously important to try and stay healthy as long as possible, he’s not going to let one injury cause him to scale back his determination on each play, even if it means absorbing multiple hits.

“You can’t really worry about those things, to be honest. You just have to assume that you’re going to make it through the game healthy and you’re going to give your best effort every week when you go out,” LaPorta said. “The freak accidents happen. You train, you prepare, and get your body as best as you can for the season, and then some things happen, and you’ve just got to live with the results, unfortunately. It’s the game we play.”

LaPorta finished the season with 40 catches for 489 yards in nine contests, a pace that would have produced career-high numbers for a player who was already playing at a Pro Bowl level. That’s not to mention the clear progress he made as a blocker in both the run and pass game. He’s clearly proud of the progress he’s made and is hoping to pick up right where he left off once he’s back on the field again.

“I was very happy with how I was playing in my third season,” LaPorta said. “I felt like I was making strides even from my first and second year, and hopefully an even better player to come in the future once I rehab and get healthy again.”",https://platform.prideofdetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/127/2026/01/gettyimages-2245905348.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.729663053601%2C100%2C78.540673892798&w=1200,N,,2026-01-05 23:00:05.829722

Adams is a player who’s rarely hurt or unavailable, so his absence from the Los Angeles Rams’ lineup not only hurt the offense, but it frustrated him, too.

It was reported by Jay Glazer of FOX on Sunday that Adams was pushing to play against the Arizona Cardinals in the finale but the Rams played it safe and held him out for another week. He also looked good running routes before the Rams’ Monday Night Football game against the Falcons, which was his second missed game.

It’s understandable that the Rams would be cautious with the playoffs approaching, but Adams seemingly didn’t agree with that plan. Sean McVay admitted during his media session on Monday that the Rams’ careful approach “pissed him off pretty good.”

Hamstring injuries are tricky and can be aggravated pretty easily if they're not fully healed, which is exactly what happened with Adams when he got hurt in Week 15. He had been dealing with a hamstring injury in practice for a few weeks and then against the Lions, it finally went on a downfield route where he pulled up lame.

The Rams were protecting against that exact scenario by holding him out until the playoffs, which was in the best interest of everyone. Sure, they could've used him against the Seahawks and Falcons, which might've netted them the No. 1 seed, but they couldn't risk losing him for the rest of the year – including the postseason.

Coming off a physical, low-scoring divisional battle, Shanahan addressed the team's injury report, linebacker depth, and the challenges ahead against the defending Super Bowl champions.

Here are the top takeaways from Shanahan to start the week of postseason preparation:

Injury Report

Shanahan opened with updates from Saturday night's game, noting several players who will be evaluated throughout the week.

Linebackers Dee Winters (ankle) and Luke Gifford (quad), defensive lineman Keion White (hamstring), and safety Ji'Ayir Brown (rib) will all be monitored, with Brown listed as day-to-day. Defensive lineman Kalia Davis (knee tendinitis) is also day-to-day.

Linebacker Tatum Bethune suffered a groin tear and will be out for the remainder of the season, with Shanahan acknowledging surgery is a possibility.

""That's something they're still deciding,"" Shanahan said.

Shanahan also provided updates on players who missed the Week 18 contest. Tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) will be evaluated throughout the week, with Pearsall dealing with a reaggravation of his PCL injury.

Meanwhile, wide receiver Jacob Cowing is expected to take a step forward this week, as Shanahan confirmed his practice window will open on Wednesday. Quarterback Brock Purdy checked out fine after taking a late sack against Seattle.

Confidence in Linebacker Depth

With Bethune sidelined and Winters' status uncertain, Shanahan expressed confidence in veteran linebacker Eric Kendricks stepping into a larger role.

""I'm real confident in Eric,"" Shanahan said. ""He's been here long enough. These games he's gotten in the last couple weeks he's done a good job, and I'm glad that we've got him for this situation.""

If Winters is unable to play, Shanahan said Garret Wallow and Curtis Robinson are both options at the weakside linebacker spot.

When asked about the possibility of Fred Warner returning later in the postseason, Shanahan said it's not something the team is considering at this point.

""I think it's too far off right now,"" Shanahan said. ""It is a possibility as we got closer to a possible third game… but it's not something we're thinking about right now.""

Turning the Page to Philadelphia

Once the Wild Card matchup was finalized on Sunday, Shanahan and his staff quickly shifted gears.

""We were excited that it was on a Sunday so we can have a normal seven-day week,"" Shanahan said. ""Now we're getting going on Philly.""

Though early in the game-planning process, Shanahan acknowledged the challenges Philadelphia presents on both sides of the ball.

""We know how good Philly is,"" Shanahan said. ""They have a great defense. They've got a very talented and good offense in terms of how well they run the ball and some of the playmakers they have, and the issue that their quarterback presents.""

Shanahan noted similarities between the Eagles and Seahawks defenses, particularly up front.

""They've got a really good pass rush and tight coverage,"" Shanahan said.

Embracing the Road Ahead

With the postseason now officially underway, Shanahan said the message to the team has been to embrace the challenge, regardless of opponent.

""That's what our guys are ready for,"" Shanahan said. ""I don't think we cared who we played. The main thing was knowing that you've got to go to three on the road to get there to the last game of the season as opposed to two games at home to get there. So, that was the biggest thing in playing the hard way.

""Right now, you can't get picky about who you play, whether it's the defending champs or whether it's the seventh seed. This is the playoffs. Everyone's earned the right to be here. If you want to reach your ultimate goal, you've got to be good enough to beat anybody.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/49ers/ltqs521xeolg6m6auy3d,N,,2026-01-05 19:59:01.563655

Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak reportedly an NFL head coach candidate

The 49ers (12-5) have a chance to get two star offensive players back for a wild-card game at Philadelphia (11-6) on Sunday with coach Kyle Shanahan saying Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) and receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle) will be evaluated later in the week after missing last week’s game.

Bethune had stepped in at middle linebacker after star Fred Warner went down with an ankle injury in Week 6 and was the team’s defensive play-caller on the field for the eight games he started this season.

Bethune got hurt during a Week 18 loss to Seattle and Eric Kendricks will step in to fill that role when the Niners face the Eagles.

Kendricks was signed to the practice squad in late November and played 46 snaps on defense the past three games after being promoted each week to the game day roster. The 33-year-old Kendricks has started 143 regular-season games and six playoff games since entering the league with Minnesota in 2015.

“I’m real confident in Eric,” Shanahan said. “He’s been here long enough. These games he has gotten in the last couple weeks he’s done a good job, and I’m glad that we’ve got him for this situation.”

Shanahan said that Warner is making progress but that any potential return for him wouldn’t come until the NFC title game at the earliest if the 49ers can win their next two games.

The San Francisco offense struggled last week against Seattle’s without Williams and Pearsall as the running game never got going and there were few open receivers downfield.

The Niners have averaged just 2.8 yards per carry running to the left side since Williams got hurt on the opening snap in Week 17.

Pearsall leads San Francisco with eight catches on throws at least 20 yards downfield. Quarterback Brock Purdy didn’t attempt a single deep pass last week in his absence.

In other injury news, linebacker Dee Winters (ankle), LB Luke Gifford (quadriceps) and defensive lineman Keion White (hamstring) will all be evaluated throughout the week to determine whether they can practice or play. Safety Ji’Ayir Brown (ribs) and defensive tackle Kalia Davis (knee) are day to day.

The 49ers will also open the practice window this week for second-year receiver Jacob Cowing, who has been out since injuring his hamstring in August.",https://sports.mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/san-francisco-49ers-seattle-seahawks-tatum-bethune-getty-900.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 21:13:25.393638

Chargers injury updates Harbaugh didn't have much in the way of injury updates when asked on Monday.","The Chargers have drawn the Patriots in the Wild Card Round of the 2025 NFL playoffs.

Here are five takeaways from Chargers Head Coach Jim Harbaugh's Monday press conference.

1. Playoff mindset

Most days after a game, Harbaugh offers up a few smiles or a laugh in his afternoon media session.

Not on this Monday.

With the Bolts road playoff game against the Patriots looming, the Chargers Head Coach was locked in as ever during a media session that lasted fewer than 10 minutes.

""Ready to have at it. I know it's only Monday, but that's the kind of energy that's in the building,"" Harbaugh said.

The Chargers are the No. 7 seed in the AFC playoff field after they finished 11-6 after the 2025 season.

The Patriots, meanwhile, are the second-seeded team in the AFC after New England went 14-3 and won the AFC East.

Harbaugh said Monday that he's excited to see how his team approaches the week ahead in terms of their preparation so they can be ready to go Sunday night.

""I expect a playoff-type of atmosphere. We've all seen that a lot, specifically in Foxborough,"" Harbaugh said. ""Getting ourselves prepared physically, mentally, is the task at hand.""

2. Chargers injury updates

Harbaugh didn't have much in the way of injury updates when asked on Monday.

""I don't have an update on anybody today,"" Harbaugh said. ""Let the treatment occur and Wednesday we'll be able to update on who's participating in practice and in what capacity.""

The Chargers will practice Wednesday, Thursday and Friday before flying to the East Coast on Friday afternoon.

The Bolts do have a few key players to keep an eye on, including Omarion Hampton. The rookie running back is dealing with an ankle injury and did not play in Sunday's regular-season finale in Denver.

""I feel like he's do anything and everything he can to get back as fast as he can,"" Harbaugh said.

Harbaugh was also asked about left tackle Jamaree Salyer, who sustained a hamstring injury in the first quarter of a Week 16 win in Dallas.

Salyer missed the Bolts final two regular-season games but did go through a pregame workout Sunday in Denver.

""Continue to let the treatment occur and the rehab,"" Harbaugh said of Salyer. ""By Wednesday we'll know what participation will be like.""

The status of cornerback Donte Jackson, who suffered an ankle injury against the Broncos, will also be worth watching.

3. Respect for the Patriots

It was a little over a year ago that the Chargers went to New England and scored a 40-7 win that secured a playoff berth.

These are not the same Patriots, as New England has an entirely new coaching staff led by Mike Vrabel, plus plenty of roster improvements that led to a 14-win season.

""The record. Most dramatically,"" Harbaugh said when asked about New England's 10-win turnaround.

Harbaugh was asked Monday about what the hallmark of a Vrabel-coached team is.

Vrabel played linebacker for 14 NFL seasons and was a First-Team All-Pro and Pro Bowler with New England in 2007. He won three Super Bowls as a player with the Patriots and is a member of the team's Hall of Fame.

""The thing that sticks out, his teams play like he played. I do notice that,"" Harbaugh said. ""Tough, gritty, physical, smart, fast. They kind of like to hit like he liked to hit. That's what I've noticed.""

The Patriots defense certainly fits that bill as New England's unit is a disruptive and disciplined group that makes life difficult for the opposition.

New England finished fourth in the NFL in scoring defense (18.8 points per game) and also finished in the Top 10 in key stats such as yards per game (295.2) rushing yards per game (101.7) and first downs allowed per game (17.8).

On a more advanced level, the Patriots ranked ninth in defensive EPA per game.

""The most important categories they're top five, top 10 — Points per game, run defense,"" Harbaugh said. ""It's not a lot of takeaways, that's not in the top 10, but it's really good, sound. Able to play a 3-4 team that can play as an 4-3 team, a 4-3 team that can go to a five-man line.

""Hallmarks in their coverages, which they play really well. They play the single-high, split-safety, all really good, effective. Very downhill, very physical, very good tacklers. Really sound,"" Harbaugh added. ""Player driven, they put players in position to be successful. They do a great job with that. Long list of things that they do well.""

The Patriots defense tied for 18th in 2025 with 19 total takeaways.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/chargers/pho0dcpkwmjvudnvs1lf,N,,2026-01-05 21:13:28.353606

Bills head coach Sean McDermott ruled out rookie cornerback Maxwell Hairston for Sunday's Wild Card matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars due to an ankle injury.

Hairston got banged up at the end of Week 18 against the Jets, exiting the game and heading to the locker rooms with the training staff.

""Probably more week to week, if I had to guess, right now, but we'll see where it goes,"" McDermott shared.

Buffalo received better news on kicker Matt Prater who left the game with a right quad injury. Prater got hurt during the first half and was ruled out after half time. However it does not appear to be as serious as the kicker's initial quad injury that caused him to miss two Weeks 15 and 16.

""He's more day to day, which is a good sign, but we're still going to, more than likely, bring some kickers in tomorrow (Tuesday) for a workout,"" McDermott said.

The Bills will have two plans this week, one for if Prater can play against Jacksonville and one for if he can't.

RB Ty Johnson is day to day as well. Additionally, Buffalo won't be activating anyone off IR this week.

Praise for Cook's rushing title

Sean McDermott was just like a lot of us Sunday night of Week 18, sweating out the results of Sunday Night Football between the Ravens and Steelers.

Coming into the game, James Cook III had a 152-yard lead on RB Derrick Henry for the NFL rushing title. It appeared as if Henry was poised to pass the Bills RB with 112 yards in the first half.

""I knew the number, and I stayed up to do everything I could to make sure it was going to go the way it was going to go — not that I had any control at that point,"" McDermott laughed.

Originally, the Bills had planned to play Cook for a full quarter against the Jets in hopes of boosting his chances to have the league's most rushing yards. With the Bills resting many starters McDermott changed course and pulled Cook after he got two carries for 15 yards on the first two plays of the game.

""I was watching the (Ravens-Steelers) game, and you know, I'm praying that we made the right decision. And tell you what, it's not easy. You expose him too long, and maybe he gets hurt, and you're not loving it. So you try to do your best to keep him healthy, but also get him to a spot where he can kind of reap the fruits of his labor,"" McDermott said.

OC Joe Brady said he's proud of the way Cook handled this entire season, from the summer negotiations surrounding his contract to now proving why he belongs in the conversation for the NFL's top running back.

""All he's done is just showed up to work and absolutely put on an incredible performance this year. I couldn't be happier for him. Not often do guys get paid and then take their game up to another level,"" Brady said.

Cook finished the regular season with 307 carries for 1,621 yards and 12 rushing TDs.

Early look at the explosive Jags offense

Since Week 10, the Jaguars rank first in the AFC in points scored, averaging 33.1 points per game. They boast an 8-1 record during that span, the second-best win percentage by an AFC team

While the Jaguars have improved in several areas this year, one of the biggest impacts has been the addition of WR Jakobi Myers who joined the team at the trade deadline. Meyers' Jacksonville debut came in Week 10 against the Texans.

""I thought one of the moves that's made a difference for them offensively is adding Jakobi Meyers. Good pickup for them, probably a guy that's quite honestly been undervalued in his career,"" McDermott said.

Meyers is just one of a handful of reliable playmakers the Jaguars have on offense. RB Travis Etienne recorded over 1,000 rushing yards for the third time in four seasons, WR Parker Washington leads the team with 347 receiving yards and two touchdowns in the last three games.

It's all buoyed by QB Trevor Lawrence who is playing some of the best football of his career. Lawrence set the Jags' franchise record with 38 total TDs in 2025, just one fewer than Bills QB Josh Allen.

""You just see Trevor's comfortable, he's comfortable in the offense, "" DC Bobby Babich said. ""He's comfortable in their operation with what they're doing. They do some good things on offense, and they've got some talent around, which certainly helps.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bills/heba6if9bswwvjfadxuu,N,,2026-01-05 19:00:37.927762

Ward, the No. 1 pick in last year's NFL draft, had tests Monday after he exited Sunday's loss to Jacksonville in the first quarter. He said he's relieved that the diagnosis was less severe than originally thought, and that the plan is to let the injury heal.

""There is relief for myself, for the building and the training staff,"" Ward said. ""They are going to get it right, continue to walk me through the process [and] what I need to do to get better and get back on the field. I just need to heal.""

Ward was injured on the Titans' first drive of the game when he landed awkwardly on his right shoulder as he dove into the end zone to cap off a 7-yard touchdown run to give the Titans an early 7-0 lead.

Ward, the only quarterback in the NFL to have taken all his team's snaps through Week 17, was later seen on the sideline in the second half with his right arm in a sling. The rookie had played all 951 snaps on offense for the Titans up to the point he was injured.

He said he doesn't know what the timeline for recovery and rehab will be, but he said it won't alter his offseason schedule.

""I'm working on my base of my mechanics; I'm not changing my throwing motion,"" Ward said. ""So the timetable for what I have set to get to mechanically [this offseason], what I need to do, is still on schedule.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0104%2Fr1596491_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 19:00:40.980679

Tampa Bay is out of the postseason mix for the first time since 2019 and evaluation will commence in the coming days for the coaching staff. Exit interviews will occur over the next few days as the team moves into offseason mode.

""We just didn't execute and that is what you are supposed to do to be successful as an offense,"" noted receiver Jalen McMillan. ""We just have to hit on all cylinders next year and figure it out.""

After a 6-2 start to the season, the Bucs fell to 7-9 prior to the Week 18 clash with the Panthers on Saturday. A myriad of factors contributed to the club's roller-coaster year, including injuries, offensive lulls, lack of consistent pressure by the defensive front, mental lapses and self-inflicted wounds. McMillan, who worked his way back from a significant neck injury sustained in the second preseason game against the Steelers, took a retrospective glance at what he gleaned from 2025 and the rehabilitation process.

""Adversity is going to creep around the corner but it taught me that I am resilient and I am strong and that I can really face anything that comes my way,"" described McMillan.

McMillan rigorously worked his way back and suited up against the Falcons on Thursday Night Football in Week 15. In just his third game after returning from injury, McMillan recorded a career-high 114 receiving yards on a career-best seven receptions against Miami. It marked the first 100-yard receiving game of McMillan's career, with his previous high being 75 yards on Dec. 15, 2024 at the Los Angeles Chargers. McMillan's 33-yard catch in the second quarter matched his career long and the second-year receiver ignited the offense. He created a spark, galvanizing the squad with his route-running acumen and quickness in and out of breaks. McMillan credited future Hall of Famer Mike Evans for bolstering his confidence down the stretch.

""I think he helped me understand my worth as a receiver and he was able to teach me that it is okay to make mistakes but the biggest thing was just how good of a receiver I am – he was able to speak that into me and just encourage me,"" noted McMillan.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/buccaneers/cpuz3a0j4ekv60gtfolf,N,,2026-01-05 19:59:10.623945

Final evaluations for the 2025 NFL Draft's rookie class are in order after the regular season's conclusion. A slew of first-round picks looked like future stars, and several later-round selections were similarly promising.

Here was each team's most impactful rookie, determined by a combination of immediate contributions, PFF grades and workload.

JUMP TO A TEAM:

ARZ | ATL | BLT | BUF | CAR | CHI | CIN | CLE | DAL | DEN | DET | GB | HOU | IND | JAX | KC | LVR | LAC | LAR | MIA | MIN | NE | NO | NYG | NYJ | PHI | PIT | SF | SEA | TB | TEN | WSH

Arizona Cardinals: DI Walter Nolen (Round 1, No. 16 Overall)

Nolen missed much of the campaign due to calf and knee injuries before being placed on injured reserve due to a separate knee injury suffered in Week 16. In between those ailments, the first-round pick played 169 snaps across six appearances and looked like a game-wrecker.

He recorded the seventh-most quarterback pressures (15, tied) among rookie interior defenders, and his 13.0% pass-rush win rate placed him 16th among 148 interior defenders who logged at least 75 pass-rushing snaps.

Atlanta Falcons: S Xavier Watts (Round 3, No. 96 Overall)

The 36th-ranked player on the 2025 PFF Big Board fell to the 96th overall pick, where the Falcons traded up to make him a key piece of their rebuilt defense. It was regarded as a steal at the time, and it’s looking like a steal now.

Watts was one of only two rookie defenders to log 1,000 snaps this regular season, playing a starter’s workload for all 17 of Atlanta’s contests. His five interceptions tied for the second most among safeties. He also managed to avoid the typical rookie tackling woes, notching an 8.6% missed tackle rate, which places him 19th among 107 qualifying safeties.

Baltimore Ravens: S Malaki Starks (Round 1, No. 27 Overall)

The Ravens wasted little time in making Starks and linebacker Teddye Buchanan locked-in starters as rookies. While the team’s defense ultimately failed to match the franchise’s reputation for hard-nosed, stout play, Starks morphed into an important playmaker for the unit.

Like the Falcons’ Xavier Watts, highlighted above, Starks was one of two rookies to log 1,000 defensive snaps this regular season. He was the NFL’s highest-graded defender from Weeks 9-10, and his 80.8 PFF run-defense grade from Weeks 14-18 ranked fifth among safeties.

Buffalo Bills: TE Jackson Hawes (Round 5, No. 173 Overall)

Hawes caught all of 16 passes as a redshirt senior at Georgia Tech, but he was one of only seven Power Four tight ends to earn 70.0-plus PFF pass-blocking and run-blocking grades. The Bills have used that skill set to perfection.

The fifth-round pick ended his rookie regular-season campaign as the NFL’s highest-graded rookie (85.2), powered by his blocking prowess. He was one of just three tight ends with 70.0-plus PFF pass-blocking and run-blocking grades, and he even contributed three scores and 187 receiving yards to a Bills offense in need of reliable pass catchers.

Carolina Panthers: WR Tetairoa McMillan (Round 1, No. 8 Overall)

McMillan became the second-ever Panthers rookie to surpass 1,000 receiving yards — and the only first-year player to accomplish the feat this season. In doing so, he solidified himself as a No. 1 target for quarterback Bryce Young for years to come.

The 22-year-old managed 55 first-down receptions — the seventh most among all receivers. Drops, seven of them, proved to be an issue, but McMillan never lost Young’s trust. His 120 targets were 61 more than the next-closest Panthers receiver.

Chicago Bears: T Ozzy Trapilo (Round 2, No. 56 Overall)

Tight end Colston Loveland and wide receiver Luther Burden III came on strong to close out the Bears’ 2025 regular season, leading the team with 597 and 481 receiving yards, respectively, since Week 9. But as good as they were, Trapilo provided arguably even more value.

Since he became a starter at left tackle in Week 12, the second-rounder allowed just 13 quarterback pressures. His 77.7 PFF pass-blocking grade over the span was better than all but that of Chiefs first-rounder Josh Simmons. That helped quarterback Caleb Williams work from a clean pocket 64.8% of the time during that stretch — the 13th-best rate in the NFL.

Cincinnati Bengals: G Dylan Fairchild (Round 3, No. 81 Overall)

The Bengals’ rookie class took its lumps, from linebackers Barrett Carter and Demetrius Knight Jr. to edge defender Shemar Stewart. Fairchild was a bright spot, however.

Cincinnati made Fairchild a starter at left guard from Week 1. While he went through a rough patch, surrendering 14 quarterback pressures across his first five outings, he settled in by the regular season’s end. From Week 13 onward, he slotted in as the 11th-best pass-blocking guard (78.5), with only eight pressures allowed over the six-game stretch.

Cleveland Browns: LB Carson Schwesinger (Round 2, No. 33 Overall)

Schwesinger just missed out on hearing his name called as a first-rounder, but his play this season was that of a Day 1 pick.

Before the UCLA product missed the Browns’ season-finale win over the Bengals due to quad and ankle injuries, he amassed 958 defensive snaps and 106 solo tackles — both top-25 marks among linebackers. Only five linebackers tallied more run stops than his 37.

Highest-Graded Rookie LBs Since 2023

Dallas Cowboys: G Tyler Booker (Round 1, No. 12 Overall)

The Cowboys keep using first-round picks on offensive linemen, and they keep hitting. Booker is well in line to star on Dallas’ line for the long haul, joining 2022 first-rounder Tyler Smith and 2024 first-rounder Tyler Guyton.

No rookie guard earned a better PFF overall grade than Booker (72.0) during the regular season. His advanced work as a run blocker resulted in a 17.5% impact-block rate, which ranked 11th among 102 qualifying guards.

Denver Broncos: RB RJ Harvey (Round 2, No. 60 Overall)

Broncos head coach Sean Payton opened the season with free-agent signing JK Dobbins as his lead running back, and Dobbins excelled to the point of ranking fifth in the NFL in rushing yards through Week 10 (772). But a season-ending Lisfranc injury thrust Harvey into a bigger role.

While Harvey never truly broke out, he showed flashes of bell-cow potential. He saw the eighth-most targets among running backs (57) and found the end zone 12 times overall. Despite his uninspiring 69.2 PFF rushing grade (T-52nd), Harvey is in line to lead Denver’s backfield in 2026 after showing off an all-around skill set this regular season.

Detroit Lions: G Tate Ratledge (Round 2, No. 57 Overall)

Ratledge entered the 2025 campaign tasked with filling the shoes of Kevin Zeitler, who earned a near-elite 86.5 PFF overall grade in 2024. The rookie got his NFL career off to a strong start, posting the 12th-best PFF run-blocking grade (73.5) among guards.

Pass blocking proved to be a challenge for the right guard, but, like many other rookies, he improved as the season wore on. He gave up six pressures and no sacks across his final seven outings after surrendering 18 pressures and two sacks over his first 10 games.

Green Bay Packers: WR Matthew Golden (Round 1, No. 23 Overall)

One wouldn’t assume that Golden was the Packers’ most impactful rookie by looking at a stat sheet. It’s true that his box score — 29 catches for 361 yards and no touchdowns — tells the story of his season, though: Green Bay didn’t use him much.

The Packers sent just 40 targets his way during the regular season, the fewest for a rookie first-round wide receiver (minimum 200 receiving snaps) since Darrius Heyward-Bey’s 38 in 2009. Yet, no rookie receiver who saw more than 25 catchable targets this regular season hauled in a higher percentage of passes than Golden (96.7%). He did what he could on his meager workload, earning a 68.1 PFF receiving grade.

Houston Texans: RB Woody Marks (Round 4, No. 116 Overall)

Marks handled just 12 carries in the Texans’ first three games, despite Joe Mixon’s lingering foot injury. Soon enough, Nick Chubb began ceding work to the rookie, who went on to log 184 more rushes, albeit for just 3.6 yards per carry.

Marks will have to improve his efficiency numbers to remain at the forefront of Houston’s rush attack, though. His 2.59 yards after contact per attempt average ranked last among qualifying rookie runners, and he forced fewer missed tackles (27) than several first-year players with fewer carries, including Jacory Croskey-Merritt and TreVeyon Henderson.

Indianapolis Colts: TE Tyler Warren (Round 1, No. 14 Overall)

The tight end position appears to be evolving, with younger players producing earlier in their NFL careers. Since at least 2006, when PFF began collecting data, the 2025 tight end class ranked first in targets, receptions, yards, first downs and a host of other categories.

Warren led the way in each of those facets, although his production dipped after Colts quarterback Daniel Jones’ season-ending Achilles injury. His 106 targets in the regular season were the most by an Indianapolis tight end since Eric Ebron in 2018.

Jacksonville Jaguars: WR/CB Travis Hunter (Round 1, No. 2 Overall)

Although Hunter’s season was cut well short, after seven games, by a knee injury, his impact in that short span is deserving of an inclusion here.

Hunter ranked second among rookie cornerbacks in PFF coverage grade (72.7), and he contributed 298 receiving yards and a touchdown as a receiver. His final game was his best: eight catches for 101 yards and a score, in addition to a pass breakup on the only target into his coverage.

Kansas City Chiefs: T Josh Simmons (Round 1, No. 32 Overall)

Stability at left tackle has been hard to come by for the Chiefs, who have cycled through several lackluster options since Orlando Brown Jr. departed in free agency ahead of the 2023 season.

Simmons may well be the team’s long-term answer at that spot. His 75.5 PFF pass-blocking grade is easily the best mark among any Chiefs player to see snaps at left tackle since Brown yielded the role. Simmons missed a chunk of the season due to personal reasons but still made a significant impact for Kansas City.

Las Vegas Raiders: RB Ashton Jeanty (Round 1, No. 6 Overall)

No rookie would have been able to singlehandedly salvage the Raiders’ woeful 2025 season, although the weight of the world was placed on Jeanty’s shoulders to do so at the beginning of the campaign.

Jeanty endured an overwhelmingly disappointing year, and yet, he was still the most impactful Las Vegas rookie. Only James Cook, Jahmyr Gibbs, Jonathan Taylor and Bijan Robinson forced more missed tackles, putting the No. 6 overall pick in excellent company. He fought through poor offensive line play, generating just 0.6 yards before contact — the third-worst average among running backs with at least 100 carries.

Los Angeles Rams: EDGE Josaiah Stewart (Round 3, No. 90 Overall)

Hitting on defensive line draft picks has become a specialty of general manager Les Snead, from Aaron Donald and Michael Brockers to Kobie Turner and Jared Verse, among many others.

Stewart is aiming to join that list. He ranked behind only the Giants’ Abdul Carter in PFF pass-rush grade (74.0) among rookie edge defenders, and his 15.3% pass-rush win rate even bested that of the No. 3 overall pick.

Los Angeles Chargers: S R.J. Mickens (Round 6, No. 214 Overall)

Running back Omarion Hampton and tight end Oronde Gadsden II are viable candidates here, but Mickens, a sixth-round pick, provided unprecedented depth for the team at safety.

While he saw just nine targets across 219 coverage snaps, Mickens nabbed two interceptions. That effort resulted in a 12.5 passer rating allowed in coverage — the top mark among 107 qualifying safeties this regular season.

Miami Dolphins: RB Ollie Gordon II (Round 6, No. 179 Overall)

It was a rather disastrous year for the Dolphins’ rookie class. Gordon was the lone member of eight qualifiers to play 100 or more snaps and record a 60.0-plus PFF overall grade.

When Miami’s crowded backfield didn’t hold him back, Gordon tended to produce. He averaged more than 4.2 yards per carry and earned a 70.0-plus PFF rushing grade in three games of the four games in which he logged at least nine carries. In all other games, he provided a combined 1.7 yards per rush.

Minnesota Vikings: G Donovan Jackson (Round 1, No. 24 Overall)

The Vikings will feel good about Jackson anchoring their interior offensive line for the foreseeable future after his flashes as a rookie.

It wasn’t always pretty for the left guard, who earned a 38.8 PFF pass-blocking grade in Week 2 and a 19.6 mark in Week 15, but he went his final nine outings without allowing a sack and produced a career-high 70.8 PFF run-blocking grade in Week 16.

New England Patriots: T Will Campbell (Round 1, No. 4 Overall)

This year’s first-round offensive linemen fared particularly well, led by Campbell, whose season isn’t done yet after the Patriots secured the AFC’s No. 2 seed.

The Patriots ended the 2024 season with PFF’s last-ranked offensive line. Campbell turned the tide for the unit, earning a team-high 76.1 PFF pass-blocking grade across 476 pass-blocking snaps.

New Orleans Saints: QB Tyler Shough (Round 2, No. 40 Overall)

The Saints’ front office calmly stared down salary-cap purgatory before changing the franchise’s trajectory by drafting Shough and tackle Kelvin Banks Jr.

Shough delivered the 15th-best PFF passing grade since Week 9, when he became New Orleans’ full-time starter, to rank ahead of players such as Jalen Hurts, Patrick Mahomes, Justin Herbert and Sam Darnold. Only five qualifying passers posted a lower turnover-worthy play rate than the rookie (2.2%).

New York Giants: QB Jaxson Dart (Round 1, No. 25 Overall)

Dart paired with running back Cam Skattebo to bring a new energy to the Giants’ offense. While that was short-lived, with Skattebo suffering a season-ending leg injury in Week 8, Dart remained a big-play threat for the 4-13 Giants.

The Ole Miss product ranked eighth in big-time throw rate (5.2%), and his 38 first-down runs were the fifth most in a regular season for a rookie quarterback over the past 10 years.

New York Jets: T Armand Membou (Round 1, No. 7 Overall)

Membou finished the regular season as one of just 10 tackles leaguewide to play 1,000-plus snaps and earn a 70.0-plus PFF overall grade. And he was one of only two rookies to do so.

The 21-year-old is poised to pair with Olu Fashanu to propel the Jets’ line into the next era with a new quarterback in 2026 and beyond. The rookie’s 5.4% pressure rate allowed ranked 29th among 98 qualifying tackles.

Philadelphia Eagles: LB Jihaad Campbell (Round 1, No. 31 Overall)

The Eagles leaned on Campbell early in the campaign before Nakobe Dean’s return from injury in Week 7. The rookie linebacker was then largely phased out of Philadelphia’s plans, despite his strong play.

From Weeks 1-7, Campbell was the NFL’s ninth-highest-graded linebacker (82.5). As a mostly part-time player from Weeks 8-16, he ranked 61st (52.4). He reassumed a starting role in Weeks 17 and 18 with Dean sidelined and again displayed positive play, earning 70.3 and 64.8 PFF overall grades.

Pittsburgh Steelers: DI Derrick Harmon (Round 1, No. 21 Overall)

The Steelers chose not to utilize rookie running back Kaleb Johnson (51 snaps) in his rookie season, so their three rookie defensive linemen are the options here. None earned a 60.0-plus PFF overall grade, though.

Regardless, Harmon proved to be a force at times. Without him on the field, the Steelers allowed 4.5 yards per carry this regular season. With him, the defense surrendered 3.8 yards per carry.

San Francisco 49ers: CB Upton Stout (Round 3, No. 100 Overall)

Stout saw playing time in 16 games this regular season, developing into an effective run defender, coverage player, and part-time blitzer along the way.

He turned in an 87.5 PFF coverage grade from Weeks 11-18, the second-best figure among all cornerbacks. Over that span, he broke up three passes and surrendered zero touchdowns on 34 targets in coverage. Stout also added 17 tackles in run defense this regular season to put himself in the top 15 at the position.

Seattle Seahawks: S Nick Emmanwori (Round 2, No. 35 Overall)

The athletic Emmanwori made his starting debut in earnest in Week 5 after suffering a high ankle sprain following four snaps in Week 1, and it was everything the Seahawks’ front office could have hoped for.

He finished that game as the NFL’s third-highest-graded safety (81.4) for the week, and he went on to earn 70.0-plus marks in run defense and coverage for the regular season, albeit with some occasional hiccups. Seattle’s stout defense wouldn’t be where it is — powering the NFC’s top-seeded playoff team — without Emmanwori.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers: WR Emeka Egbuka (Round 1, No. 19 Overall)

What a start to Egbuka’s rookie season it was. With Chris Godwin, Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan all sidelined for stints, Egbuka turned NFL defenses into his playground.

Through Week 10, he ranked ninth in receiving yards (677), fourth in touchdowns (six, tied) and 22nd in yards per route run (2.20). But as Tampa Bay’s wide receiver room grew healthy, Egbuka’s role diminished, and he logged only 23 catches for 261 yards and no scores the rest of the way. He was still a key piece of the Buccaneers’ 6-2 start before things came crashing down.

Tennessee Titans: WR Chimere Dike (Round 4, No. 103 Overall)

Cam Ward provided the Titans with hope for the future at quarterback, the likely leader of the franchise for years to come. Dike, meanwhile, brought immediate pep to the team.

The Titans gave the fourth-rounder the keys to special teams stardom, allowing him to average a league-high 17.9 yards per punt return, take two returns back for scores and earn an elite 91.0 PFF punt-return grade. On offense, he saw the fourth-most targets among rookie wide receivers (73) and secured four more touchdowns.

Washington Commanders: T Josh Conerly Jr. (Round 1, No. 29 Overall)

It’s hard to overstate the impact of a stalwart offensive line bookend. Conerly has work to do after conceding eight sacks this season — four of which came in Weeks 1 and 2 — but he improved down the stretch.",https://media.pff.com/2026/01/Shough-Tyler-Feature-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675,N,,2026-01-05 19:59:13.875022

Ward left the game after scoring a running touchdown on Tennessee's opening drive that stood as its only score of the game. He took a shot to his upper body as he crossed the goal line and went into the sideline medical tent after the play. He then walked to the locker room on the ensuing Jacksonville possession.

Ward did not return to the lineup for Tennessee's next possession. His backup, Brandon Allen, took over at quarterback and the Titans eventually lost, 41-7.

Players who will be evaluated throughout the week include left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring), wide receiver Ricky Pearsall Jr. (knee/ankle), linebacker Dee Winters (ankle), defensive end Keion White (hamstring) and linebacker Luke Gifford (quad).

Williams and Pearsall did not play against Seattle. The 49ers are 4-13 in games Williams has missed due to injury since he arrived. Pearsall, who has missed nine games, provides the 49ers with the most separation and downfield ability among their receiving corps.

Those considered “day to day” are safety Ji’Ayir Brown (ribs) and defensive tackle Kalia Davis (knee tendonitis).

What is “day to day” as opposed to being evaluated throughout the week?

“It means it’s Monday and there’s a chance they might be good by Wednesday, or a chance they might be good by tomorrow,” Shanahan said. “The other ones we see as more evaluated throughout the week.”

In other developments, the 49ers will open the practice window on wide receiver Jacob Cowing, a second-year receiver and return specialist who has missed all season with a hamstring injury. He will practice Wednesday.

Shanahan said linebacker Fred Warner is not ready to begin practicing after suffering an ankle dislocation and fracture in October. Warner has said he is hoping to return on a deep playoff run.

“I think it’s too far off right now,” Shanahan said. “I think it’s a possibility, if we get to a championship game, but it’s not something we’re thinking about right now.”

That leaves the 49ers with the possibility of being very short-handed at linebacker against the Eagles, whose running game dropped off in 2025 but still prefers to play smash-mouth whenever possible with Saquon Barkley and quarterback Jalen Hurts.

With Bethune out and Winters and Gifford up in the air, Kendricks takes over in the middle with Curtis Robinson and Grant Wallow potentially getting more defensive snaps. The only practice squad linebacker other than Kendricks is Jalen Graham. Nick Martin was placed on injured reserve with concussion symptoms and is not yet eligible to be activated even when he clears protocol.

“I’m real confident in Eric,” Shanahan said. “He’s been here long enough. These games he has gotten in the last couple weeks he’s done a good job, and I’m glad we got him for this situation.”

What happened against Seattle?

Shanahan said the Seahawks game tape wasn’t much different from what he saw with his own two eyes.

“It was very, very much what we expected to see,” Shanahan said. “We knew we had a big challenge and we thought we had to play at our best. And we did not play our best. Give credit to them for that. We made too many mistakes, and when you’re in the situation we are, there’s not much room for mistakes.”

With missed tackles and being beaten on the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball a problem throughout, Shanahan considered the possibility that playing three games in 13 days prior to the Seattle game took its toll.

“I mean, that definitely doesn’t make it any easier,” Shanahan said. “I think that stuff adds up, and it does with injuries and stuff too. But that can’t be our excuse for it. You’ve got to find a way to do it.”

Shanahan was pleased the game was on a Sunday to get back on their usual schedule.

“We were excited that it was on a Sunday so we can have a normal seven-day week,” Shanahan said. “We came in this morning treating it like a Monday, just finished with the players and put the Seattle game to bed with them and we’re getting going on Philly.”

One player who rose to the occasion was rookie slot corner Upton Stout, who showed up both defending the pass and the run.

“I thought it might have been his best game of the year,” Shanahan said. “I thought he had an awesome game.”

Moving on up?

The Miami Dolphins have requested interviews with three members of the 49ers’ front office for their vacant general manager position, according to the NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero: assistant general manager R.J. Gillen, V.P. of player personnel Tariq Ahmad and scouting director Josh Williams.

Miami is coached by former 49ers assistant Mike McDaniel.

Snap judgments

A look at who played and how much in the 2025 regular season:

1,120: Last season right guard Dominick Puni missed one snap all season. This year he missed three. Rebounded to play well after a rough start. Right tackle Colton McKivitz (1,117), left tackle Trent Williams (997) played one snap in Week 17 and sat out Week 18 with a hamstring injury, while center Jake Brendel (950) missed two games.

1,066: Cornerback Deommodore Lenoir was on the field 98.3 percent of the time with no slot corner responsibilities. Had his moments but was more effective handling both roles in 2024. Lenoir was the only defensive player with more than 1,000 snaps.

932: Christian McCaffrey played 82.9 percent of the snaps and had 413 touches, meaning he had the ball on 44.3 percent of the snaps he was in the game. No back in the NFL was on the field as much or touched the ball more. Trade acquisition Brian Robinson didn’t miss a game but played just 190 snaps.

795: Wide receiver Jauan Jennings missed two games due to injury and looked to be in pain in the 15 games that he played. Still caught 55 passes for 643 yards and nine touchdowns.

576: Turf toe limited Purdy to 51.3 percent of the season snaps in nine starts. Mac Jones had 546 snaps and 48.7.

554: Tight end George Kittle missed six games with hamstring and ankle issues and his snap count was the lowest since 2020 when he had 443.

449: The combined number of season snaps for Warner (330, broken ankle) and defensive end Nick Bosa (119, torn ACL).

385: Defensive end Mykel Williams, the No. 11 overall pick in the draft, had his season end after nine games with a torn ACL. He set a mean edge but is still awaiting his first NFL sack.

Cam Ward injury: What happened, and why did it happen?","JACKSONVILLE, FL ― Tennessee Titans interim coach Mike McCoy offered his first public statement on quarterback Cam Ward's shoulder injury following the season-ending loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Jan. 4.

""We'll do more testing,"" McCoy said. ""Until they do more testing, I'll give you a better answer down the road.""

According to a report from Jeff Howe of The Athletic, the initial belief is that Ward suffered a Grade 3 AC sprain in his throwing shoulder. One source with knowledge of the situation told The Tennessean that Ward's injury is thought to be a ""significant"" AC sprain.

Ward was spotted on the sideline during the second half sporting a sling across his right arm and shoulder. He was still wearing the sling when he exited the locker room to board the team bus. He did not speak to the media following the game, but teammates, including fellow quarterback Brandon Allen, indicated that Ward is in ""good spirits.""

Cam Ward timeline: What is a 'Grade 3 AC sprain' anyway?

Grade 3 is the highest degree of severity for a shoulder sprain. Surgery isn't often recommended, even for athletes, because rest and rehab can be effective, but that's less often the case with quarterbacks and other performers who have to use their shoulders for throwing.

In short, a Grade 3 sprain is differentiated from lesser sprains because of damage to the coracoclavicular ligament that could end up displacing the collarbone a little more severely. In the cases that surgery is recommended for a Grade 3 AC sprain, recovery time is expected to range from six to nine months.

Cam Ward injury: What happened, and why did it happen?

Ward injured his right throwing shoulder lunging toward the end zone on a touchdown rush in the first quarter. The Titans designed multiple QB runs for him on his first and only possession of the game, gaining yards both times. But the rookie quarterback, who up to that point hadn't missed a single offensive snap in 2025, landed awkwardly on the football and was crunched downward by an encroaching Jaguars defender, leading to Ward getting up slowly and eventually heading to the locker room for evaluation.

Plays like that had been rare for the Titans this season; Ward averaged fewer than one designed carry per game. But McCoy indicated that plays like that had been in the playbook; it was just a matter of deploying them in this game.

""You put plays in all year long, and we've had other plays like that during the season,"" McCoy said about the designed run play call.

Within the next 30 minutes, Ward was ruled out of the game. He was replaced by Allen, who struggled mightily. The Titans didn't score another point after Ward's injury, leading to an easy victory for the AFC South champion Jaguars.

Ward was the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft and started every game for the Titans. He set the franchise single-season record for passing yards by a rookie but ultimately led the team to a 3-14 record — the same record that earned the Titans their No. 1 pick used to select Ward.","https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/04/PNAS/88019868007-usatsi-27931569.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-05 18:00:19.312849

Weakside linebacker Dee Winters sustained an ankle injury on Saturday and played 29 of the 49ers’ 69 defensive plays.","The 49ers will turn to veteran middle linebacker Eric Kendricks as the team opens the NFL playoffs.

Tatum Bethune, who started eight games in place of injured Fred Warner, will miss the remainder of the season with a torn groin muscle, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said Monday on a conference call with Bay Area reporters.

The 49ers, the sixth seed in the NFC with a 12-5 record, open the NFL playoffs on Sunday at the third-seeded Philadelphia Eagles (11-6).

Left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (ankle, knee) will be evaluated throughout the week to determine if they will be available to play against the Eagles, Shanahan said. Both players were inactive for the 49ers' regular-season finale against the Seattle Seahawks.

It has yet to be determined whether Bethune will require surgery, Shanahan said. Bethune registered 94 tackles on the season after taking over for Warner, a four-time All-Pro selection. Warner could return from a fractured and dislocated right ankle if the 49ers advance deeper into the playoffs.

The 49ers signed Kendricks, 33, an 11-year NFL veteran, to their practice squad on Nov. 26. He will take Bethune’s spot on the 53-man roster for the postseason.

“I’m real confident in Eric,” Shanahan said. “He’s been here long enough. These games he’s gotten in in the last couple of weeks he’s done a good job of. I’m glad that we got him for this situation.”

Kendricks has appeared in three games with the 49ers and made his first start with the team on Saturday night in the team’s loss to the Seahawks. Kendricks entered this season with a streak of nine consecutive seasons with 100 or more tackles. He had four tackles against Seattle.

Weakside linebacker Dee Winters sustained an ankle injury on Saturday and played 29 of the 49ers’ 69 defensive plays. He will be evaluated throughout the week to determine his status for Sunday’s game, Shanahan said. Winters leads the 49ers with 101 tackles on the season.

The top backups for Winters are Garret Wallow and Curtis Robinson.

Another linebacker, Luke Gifford, also is battling a quadriceps injury and his status is uncertain, too. Gifford was chosen to the NFC Pro Bowl team as a special-teams player.

The Broncos and Seahawks get the coveted bye week to rest and try and get as healthy as possible. 12 other teams are still playing this week, so let’s search for the injury news we need to watch.

Ricky Pearsall, WR, San Francisco 49ers

Trent Williams, T, San Francisco 49ers

The 49ers got handled by the Seahawks Saturday night, only scoring 3 points. They were missing receiver Ricky Pearsall, although Pearsall has been a mainstay on the injury report this season. The bigger issue is tackle Trent Williams, especially headed into Philadelphia. For their flaws, Philly’s defense is ferocious. Going on the road against a strong pass rush is not where you want to be without your left tackle. The status of Williams is one of the more important injuries heading into Wild Card weekend, as far as we know. Since 2020, the 49ers are 4-13 without Williams and have averaged 19.8 points per game. There is other context in that sample but that is a stark difference considering they average 26.2 points per game in the 93 games with Williams in that same timespan.

Davante Adams, WR, Los Angeles Rams

The Rams have mostly survived without Davante Adams in the lineup for the past three games, but now there is no next week. Adams has been dealing with a hamstring injury, and he did log some limited practice reps this past week. There was some thought that he may have been back against the Cardinals, but the Rams sat him out once more. Getting him back for the playoffs would be a huge plus for the whole offense, especially since they will be on the road against Carolina. Los Angeles will be looking for revenge for a loss to the Panthers in Week 13.

Lane Johnson, T, Philadelphia Eagles

Jalen Carter, DL, Philadelphia Eagles

It’s been a challenging year for Lane Johnson — he’s been in and out of the lineup. That’s a vital piece to the Philadelphia offensive line, and the Eagles think he should be back for this week. One of the weakest spots for the 49ers is the defense. They’ve dealt with injuries to every level of the defense and are still missing some of their best defensive playmakers in Fred Warner and Nick Bosa. Philly should also get good news on the defensive side, as Jalen Carter is fully expected to play. He played against the Bills in Week 17, so Week 18 appears to be just a rest day. Especially with Trent Williams coming into this week as a question mark, Carter can help the Philly defense potentially dictate this matchup.

“Upper body, he’s going to miss some time,” Bednar said after the game in Sunrise, Fla. “He’s still getting looked at and diagnosed. Did not look comfortable.”

Landeskog’s left skate blade appeared to catch on the ice while he attempted to split two Panthers defending skaters and charge toward the goal.

""First thing I learned,"" Ward said, ""is get your helmet down on a quarterback sneak, or they'll pop your ass.""

Ward said he also found out quarterbacks can throw late back the across the middle in the NFL, along with ""you have to really love the game to play (in the NFL).""

One day after suffering a right shoulder injury in the season finale at Jacksonville, Ward also learned his injury perhaps isn't as bad as some initially feared, while acknowledging some things remain uncertain.

""I don't know that for sure,"" Ward responded when asked about potential surgery. ""If that's the case we're going to do what I need to do, but I don't think that's the case right now.""

Ward said ""there is relief"" when asked about early examinations on the shoulder while saying he's willing to do whatever is asked of him by the training staff.

""They're going to get it right,"" Ward said of his shoulder. ""(And) continue to walk me through the process to what I need to do to get better, and get back on the field.

""(I need to) really just heal, talk to the trainers, probably have some rehabbing, and then just continue to try and get stronger on my shoulder and try and get ready for next year.""

Ward, who started all 17 games for the Titans in 2025, played every snap before suffering the right shoulder injury in the first quarter in Sunday's season finale at the Jaguars.

Ward finished the season completing 323-of-540 passes for 3,169 yards, 15 touchdowns and seven interceptions, with a passer rating of 80.3. Ward also rushed for 159 yards and two touchdowns.

On 540 passing attempts in 2025, Ward threw seven interceptions. His 1.3 interception percentage stands as the best single-season mark in franchise history by all qualifying quarterbacks. He broke Ryan Tannehill's franchise record of 1.5 percent in 2020. Over the final nine games of the season, Ward threw only one interception.

Ward's 540 attempts in 2025 were more than every quarterback in franchise history in a season other than Warren Moon, who had 655 attempts in 1991 and 584 attempts in 1990.

Ward said he hasn't been told a timetable on how long it will take his shoulder to heal, or how long he'll have to rehab.

""How long? There hasn't been a time limit yet, but it's a good thing it's the offseason,"" Ward said. ""I've got a couple of months.""

Ward said the experience of his rookie season gives him more confidence moving forward.

Rams head coach Sean McVay put those worries to rest Monday, however, announcing Adams is expected to face the Panthers on Saturday.

McVay admitted Adams probably could have returned to action in Week 18, but the team took a cautious approach with the 33-year-old wideout, per ESPN.

McVay said the Rams ""erred on the side of caution"" with Adams' return, and that it ""pissed him off pretty good because of the competitor that he is.""

""But he's got that look in his eye that I know he's ready to go,"" McVay said. ""And man, you just feel better when you see No. 17 out there on our offense, and it poses a lot of different challenges for people to have to defend when you put that freaking stud back out on the grass for us.""

NFL insider Jay Glazer issued a similar report prior to Sunday's game, saying Adams was pushing to play against the Cardinals, but was shut down by McVay. The Rams didn't need Adams to pick up a win in the contest, though. After overcoming a slow start, the Rams' offense broke out to score 37 points in a 17-point win over the Arizona Cardinals. That was likely exactly what McVay wanted to see after he announced he would play his starters in Week 18.

Adams was a revelation in his first season with the Rams. While the veteran posted his lowest yardage total since 2015, he made up for it with 14 scores. He proved to be the perfect complement to Puka Nacua and was a driving factor behind Stafford contending for the MVP award.

McVay said Ferguson being inactive in Week 18 was a precautionary decision made by the team because of a short turnaround coming off a Monday night game last week. He ""had accumulated a bunch of volume,"" McVay said, then ""kind of felt"" his hamstring Friday. While Ferguson played only 32 of the team's 65 offensive snaps (49.2%) in Week 17 against the Falcons, he played 76.1% of the team's offensive snaps in Week 16 against the Seahawks, 77.8% in Week 15 against the Lions and 64.3% in Week 14 against the Cardinals, all of which marked his three-highest amounts of playing time in the regular season.

""And he's obviously a special player for us and the way that we use him,"" McVay said. ""Felt it on Friday. Came in Saturday, and there wasn't optimism, in terms of, there was a possibility we could set him back, especially just knowing what we had ahead this week, and so erred on the side of caution with him. It worked out, because getting (tight end Tyler) Higbee back didn't leave us so short-handed at that position. And obviously, Higs played a lot more snaps than we had kind of planned, but he's a total stud, and did an excellent job, and we needed everything that he brought yesterday.

Ward, who finished the season on injured reserve after his latest concussion three weeks ago, said he has been unable to shake lingering symptoms and will prioritize his future health as he processes his decision.

""With the brain injuries, you don't really see it ... until you get older sometimes,"" said Ward, who is 29 and just finished the first season of a three-year, $54 million contract with the Colts.

""I'm still a pretty young guy and the more I beat my brain up, the more it'll affect me as I get older. So, I've got a lot of life to live out of football. I've got to think about my family and kids, too. So, we'll see.""

Ward's second concussion, which occurred in a collision with tight end Drew Ogletree during pregame warmups, landed him on injured reserve and resulted in severe symptoms that lasted for weeks.

He said upon his return that he worried during his absence whether he'd be able to continue playing. But Ward finally gained clearance and returned to the lineup against the Kansas City Chiefs on Nov. 23. Two weeks later, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ward suffered another concussion and is still dealing with its aftermath.

""It's going to be something to think about because I did hit my head a few days ago and I got a crazy headache,"" he said. ""So, I mean, we'll just see how it goes. I'm not trying to be dealing with migraines and headaches.""

If Ward decides to come back, he would hope to make a bigger impact. Ward was a solid addition in the games he played, often shadowing opponents' top receivers. The midseason trade for two-time All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner raised hopes that the Colts could field an elite secondary. Gardner has also dealt with injuries since his arrival and the full unit rarely played together.

But if Ward returns, he knows his own potential and that of the full unit.

""I'm definitely motivated to be the best I can be for next season,"" he said.

As for his concussion issues, Ward suggested they surprised him because he can only recall one previous concussion diagnosis in his career.

""So this was kind of an unlucky thing when I ran into [Ogletree],"" Ward said.

Of particular importance for Ward is being available for his family. Ward's 1-year-old daughter died after battling heart problems in October 2024 and Ward has struggled with his emotions since. He and his fiancée have a young son and Ward has yearned to be home in Texas with the family more often. Additionally, Ward said his father has already advised him he should retire.

""If I walk away, I feel like I'd be happy,"" he said. ""I'd have won the Super Bowl [with Kansas City] ... made hella money, made the Pro Bowl, made All-Pro. I did everything I wanted to. So, I feel like if I walk away, I won't regret it. I'm good.""

Ward said he will need to make an expeditious decision so the Colts can move forward with their roster-building. He is due a $7.98 million roster bonus in March.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0105%2Fr1596969_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 15:00:20.844374

The running back wasn’t wearing any sort of boot or brace on his foot, a notable sign in his recovery from a Lisfranc injury suffered in early November against the Las Vegas Raiders.

Broncos vs. Chargers: Live updates and highlights from the NFL Week 18 game

Originally, Dobbins was pinpointed for a potential return in February's Super Bowl, if Denver advanced that far. But the running back has been telling people inside the Broncos' building that he'll return beforehand, an ambitious but not-impossible timeline.

“It wouldn’t be soon, but that has a chance to happen,” Payton said in late November of a potential Dobbins return this season.

Even if the veteran back wasn't fully conditioned upon his return, his availability could provide a major boost to a Broncos ground game that hasn't operated nearly as efficiently since his foot injury. Denver's offense averaged 4.8 yards per carry in 10 games with Dobbins healthy; since, they're down to 4.0. Rookie running back RJ Harvey entered Sunday 14th in the NFL in touchdowns, but has displayed inconsistent vision in a bell-cow role.

Franklin-Myers inactive: The Broncos were missing a key piece of their defensive line Sunday, as starting defensive end John Franklin-Myers was inactive for the first time this season in Week 18 against the Chargers. Franklin-Myers has been limited all week with a hip issue, and was limited to just 11 snaps in Week 17 against the Chiefs.

That brings his 2025 regular season to a close, with a career-best 7.5 sacks in 16 games. He'll enter the playoffs as the lone starting member of this Broncos defensive line who isn't locked up for the forthcoming future, and Franklin-Myers is in line for a monster raise on his current two-year, $15 million deal come free agency.

In Franklin-Myers' stead, third-round pick Sai'vion Jones was activated for just the third time in his rookie season, while reserve Eyioma Uwazurike started the first game of his four-year NFL career.

Chargers sit seven starters: Los Angeles head coach Jim Harbaugh didn't attempt any shred of gamesmanship this week, announcing right away Monday that the Chargers would sit star quarterback Justin Herbert against the Broncos. And with Los Angeles essentially punting in Week 18 with little stakes to play for, the club trotted out wide swaths of its B-team -- and C-team -- against Denver Sunday.

The Chargers' inactive report included six more starters scratched -- running back Omarion Hampton, defensive backs Derwin James and Elijah Molden, outside linebacker Tuli Tuipulotu, and offensive linemen Jamaree Salyer and Bradley Bozeman -- in addition to Herbert. This wasn't exactly a divisional matchup of titans on Sunday.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25311056100185.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-05 14:00:11.254544

Landry, 29, has been dealing with his knee injury throughout the season, but played in every game of the regular season but the final two. Anfernee Jennings and Elijah Ponder have primarily filled in for the veteran, whose return feels the likeliest.

Spillane, 30, has not appeared in a game since Week 13, seemingly suffering his injury just before the bye week and didn’t play despite being active during his club’s Week 15 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Spillane eventually returned to practice this week but was not made active for the regular season finale, and has been replaced primarily by Jack Gibbens.

Tonga, 29, hasn’t played in two weeks, though the club has gotten decent production from youngsters Cory Durden, Eric Gregory and practice squadder Leonard Taylor III. Milton Williams also returned from injured reserve in Week 18.

Wilson, 22, has been in concussion protocol for the last two weeks. Ben Brown has started four games this season in his place, and performed admirably enough to earn a two-year contract extension.

Austin, 24, is practicing but still on injured reserve, meaning there will need to be a roster move made in order for him to be activated.

After an offseason featuring a trade request and subsequent contract extension, Myles Garrett capped off the 2025 season by breaking the NFL sack record.

It took Garrett until the fourth quarter of his 17th game, but for anyone trying to put an asterisk on this record, here is some added context:

Hall of Famer Michael Strahan set the record with 22.5 sacks in 16 games in 2001. Giants opponents attempted 521 passes against them that season and took 46 sacks. For simplicity, we will call this 567 ""pass plays.""

T.J. Watt tied Strahan's record in 2021, technically a 17-game season, but did so in just 15 games played that year (he missed two games due to injury). Steelers opponents had 557 pass plays in the games Watt played that season.

Garrett recorded his 23rd sack of the season in his 17th game played. Browns opponents had 540 pass plays in 2025.

So for those counting at home:

Strahan: 22.5 sacks in 567 pass plays

Watt: 22.5 sacks in 557 pass plays

Garrett: 23.0 sacks in 540 pass plays

While it is true that all counting stat ""records"" are in danger of being broken in the 17-game season era and beyond, that does not mean they should all have an asterisk next to them. Especially this one.

Enjoy your 23-sack-record and new partnership with Jordan Brand, Myles.

Although the Browns were eliminated from playoff contention five weeks ago, 2025 should give Browns fans some hope for the future. Shedeur Sanders showed promise, Quinshon Judkins scored seven touchdowns in just 14 games, Harold Fannin Jr. set franchise records for a rookie tight end and Carson Schwesinger led all NFL rookies in tackles.

To wrap that all up into some neat context: the 2025 Browns are the only team since the 1970 merger to have a rookie lead them in pass yards (Sanders), rush yards (Judkins), receiving yards (Fannin Jr.) and tackles (Schwesinger) in a season.

Speaking of Schwesinger, if he wins Defensive Rookie of the Year and Garrett takes home the Defensive Player of the Year award as expected, the 2025 Browns would be the fourth team to have both the defensive player and rookie of the year in the same season, joining: the 2013 Ravens (Ray Lewis and Terrell Suggs), the 1981 Giants (Lawrence Taylor and … Lawrence Taylor) and the 1974 Steelers (Mean Joe Greene and Jack Lambert).

2) Lawrence showcases his dual-threat ability

The first overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft is heading into the playoffs on an unbelievable heater. In his last eight games, Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence has:

An 8-0 record

19 passing touchdowns

5 rushing touchdowns

Led the Jaguars to the No. 1 offense in football (33.6 points per game in that stretch).

Lawrence is just the third player in NFL history with 19 passing touchdowns and five rushing touchdowns in any eight-game span within a season, joining Lamar Jackson in his 2019 MVP campaign and Cam Newton in his 2015 MVP campaign. His 38 total touchdowns in 2025 are the most by any player in a season in Jaguars history.

The Jaguars finished with as many wins in 2025 (13) as they had in 2023 and 2024 combined and Liam Coen became just the seventh first-time head coach in league history to win 13 games, joining Kevin O'Connell (2022), Matt LaFleur (2019), Jim Harbaugh (2011), Jim Caldwell (2009), Steve Mariucci (1997) and George Seifert (1989).

But it was not just the coach and quarterback that made history for the Jaguars this season -- as kicker Cam Little added a 67-yard field goal in Week 18 to the record books, the second-longest field goal in NFL history behind his own mark of 68 set in Week 9 against the Las Vegas Raiders. Little is the only kicker in the Super Bowl era to simultaneously hold the records for the longest and second-longest made field goals of all-time.

3) Stafford makes strong case for MVP

Despite falling out of the race for the NFC West and No. 1 seed in the conference, Matthew Stafford has remained firmly at the top of the MVP conversation with his prolific passing numbers this season. At 37 years old, Stafford finished his 2025 season with 46 touchdowns and 4,707 passing yards, both the most in the NFL. His Rams had the highest-scoring offense in the league at 30.5 points per game. Here is some MVP precedence for those facts:

The only players to outright lead the NFL in pass yards and touchdowns while playing for the top scoring offense in the NFL since 1990 are Stafford in 2025 and five quarterbacks who all won MVP that season (Patrick Mahomes in 2022, Peyton Manning in 2013, Tom Brady in 2007 and Kurt Warner in 2001).

To make that list a little more exclusive, here are the only players in NFL history to lead the NFL in pass yards and touchdowns while throwing eight or fewer interceptions: Stafford in 2025 and Brady in 2007.

In Week 18 against the Cardinals, it may have been the deciding factor in Stafford's MVP case, as he threw four more touchdowns and avoided turning the ball over. It was the ninth game this season in which he threw at least three touchdowns and avoided throwing an interception, one fewer game than Aaron Rodgers' record 10 such performances in his 2020 season (which also ended in an MVP).

To be fair to the Drake Maye fans on the other side of the MVP argument, Stafford does not have an impenetrable résumé -- his team finished 12-5 and will have to go on the road in the Wild Card Round. The last time a player won MVP on a team that was not a top-two seed in his conference (let alone on a team that failed to win their division) was Adrian Peterson in 2012. The last time a quarterback on a wild-card team won MVP was Manning in 2008.

4) JSN sets Seahawks receiving yards record

Jaxon Smith-Njigba demolished Seattle's single-season record for receiving yards (1,303 by DK Metcalf in 2020) en route to becoming the first Seahawks player since Hall of Famer Steve Largent to lead the NFL in receiving yards.

Smith-Njigba finished 2025 with 1,793 receiving yards, the second-most by a player in a season before his 24th birthday all-time. JSN was just 16 yards short of that record held by Justin Jefferson (1,809 yards in 2022).

In 15 of his 17 games played in 2025, Smith-Njigba had at least 75 receiving yards, the second-most games of that ilk in a season in NFL history. Only his current teammate Cooper Kupp had more (16 such games in 2021 with the Rams).

Maybe most impressive part of it all: Smith-Njigba did this while playing for one of the most run-heavy offenses in the NFL. The Seahawks ran the ball on 50 percent of their offensive plays in 2025, the third-highest rate behind the Ravens and Bills. Smith-Njigba is the first player in the Super Bowl era to lead the NFL in receiving yards while playing for a team that passed at a bottom-three rate in the NFL.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/sigtajftzwb07aupubma,N,,2026-01-05 17:01:06.081628

On Monday morning, Ward was asked about his season and the considerations he's making at this stage of his NFL career.
After eight NFL seasons, Ward is set financially and even made the Pro Bowl in 2023 when he led the NFL with 23 pass deflections.
At this point, Ward is uncertain whether or not he will retire or return.","Charvarius Ward has spent the last several years putting together one of the most remarkable playing careers for anyone who entered the league as an undrafted prospect. Following Week 18, the veteran cornerback admitted the NFL chapter of his story might be coming to an end.

One year ago, Ward was an exciting new addition to the Indianapolis Colts' secondary. After signing a lucrative deal in free agency, the Colts were leaning on Ward to anchor a new-look defensive backfield that would also eventually add Sauce Gardner to the mix after a blockbuster midseason trade. Together with Kenny Moore, Indy' pass coverage looked like the envy of the league—at least on paper.

Unfortunately for Ward, thw 2025 turned out to be one disastrous physical turn after another. With three documented concussions this season, Ward has every reason to consider life beyond the game through a reflective lens about what's most important to him in the long run.

The veteran cornerback says everything is on the table at this point, including returning to the game for a ninth season or walking away from it all.

On Monday morning, Ward was asked about his season and the considerations he's making at this stage of his NFL career. He was open about the possibility of walking away from it all and said his father is already asking him to retire.

""My daddy told me to retire, but I don't know, I don't think I'm gonna do it,"" said Ward. ""I just gotta see how I feel this offseason. I know going into next season, if I do come back and play again, if I get one more, I'll for sure probably retire if I get one more concussion. But hopefully, knock on wood, I don't get no more concussions. I don't have to deal with that anymore. But it was crazy, though, just dealing with all those headaches offseason. It's a painful, frustrating thing. Hopefully, I don't have to go through that again.""

The Kansas City Chiefs were the first team to give Ward a chance to play meaningful reps. Acquired from the Dallas Cowboys in a preseason trade before the 2018 season for offensive lineman Parker Ehinger, Ward played in 56 regular-season games over four seasons in K.C. and became well-respected defender in the process. That earned him a $42 million free-agent deal with the San Francisco 49ers.

Ward also admitted that his decision is not only his to make. He's got a family to consider as well. ""With the brain injuries, you don't really see it until you get older sometimes. I'm still a pretty young guy, and the more I beat my brain up, the more it'll affect me as I get older. So I mean, I got a lot of life to live out of football. I got to think about my family and kids, too.""

After eight NFL seasons, Ward is set financially and even made the Pro Bowl in 2023 when he led the NFL with 23 pass deflections. At this point, Ward is uncertain whether or not he will retire or return. But his explanation also revealed that the situation is tender at this point, with even offseason sensitivities that might make the decision clear.

""If I be working out, if I bump my head on something this offseason, hopefully I don't do that, and I get a headache from just something small like that,"" said Ward. ""I mean, it's gonna be something to think about, because I did hit my head a few days ago, and I got a crazy headache. So we'll just see how it goes. I'm not trying to deal with migraines and headaches for the rest of my life.","https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,x_1131,y_0,w_1787,h_1005/c_fill,w_1440,ar_1440:810,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/130/01ke7gt8sbvardwvxerm.jpg",N,,2026-01-05 13:00:16.304923

The Giants GM added that ""there a lot of potential head coaching candidates that are excited about the opportunity"" in New York because of players like Jaxson Dart and the roster in place.

Despite outside clamoring for Schoen's dismissal, ownership has backed the GM through a four-win season. Upon firing coach Brian Daboll, Mara said he believed Schoen had built a good core that could help build a winner.

In 2025, Big Blue drafted Dart and Abdul Carter in the first round and added Cam Skattebo in the third. Dart provided life to the franchise, Carter came on strong down the stretch, and Skattebo was a revelation before an injury waylaid his campaign. In 2024, Malik Nabers was a shining star before suffering a season-ending knee injury early this year. Even with those bright spots, there are plenty of holes Schoen must fill if New York is to have a quick turnaround.

Jordan Love was 2nd in EPA per play (+0.29) and dealt with injuries at every position around him.
Pickens was 3rd in EPA added (+88.7) and became infinitely more consistent with better QB play.
Ditto for the run game.
They can be beaten by speedy pass rushers, like Micah Parsons, in the pass game, but that's why they are right tackles.","This was a close two-player race with a clear efficiency leader and clear total volume leader. To me, the differences in their supporting casts and record were the tiebreakers. Drake Maye was 1st in EPA per play (still on top-10 usage), and the Patriots' supporting cast is below average. Maye's processing took a big leap, as did his accuracy. He easily led in completion percentage over expected (+10.3) while delivering the most consistent deep ball of the year. As a side hustle, Maye was a red zone rushing weapon and an effective scrambler whenever needed. Perhaps most surprising and valuable was his ability to navigate a bad OL. When pressured, the Patriots had the 3rd-best EPA per play. That's the definition of individual value and separated him from my runner up, who was 12th in that same metric.

Matthew Stafford easily led in touchdown passes (46) and passing yards (4,707), while still ranking 4th in success rate and 5th in EPA per play to appease the fancy bois. Those scores, by the way, were the most in a season since Aaron Rodgers' 2020 when defenses were entirely structured differently. Stafford manipulated zone defenders with his eyes from within the pocket at a level I don't remember seeing before, and his arm strength is still high-end. Stafford benefited from having Sean McVay Puka Nacua, Davante Adams, a quadruple TE room, and the best rushing success rate team in decades, but he has as much freedom and say in the offense as anyone in the league. There's no way to properly defend Stafford at this point. The Rams were 1st against man coverage, 2nd against zone coverage, and 1st against the blitz.

Josh Allen doesn't have an efficiency or head-to-head case against Maye nor a total volume case against Stafford, but he still played like an MVP for most of the season. I'd also argue in unideal circumstances. The Bills wide receiver room was amongst the very worst in the NFL, and their ground game, while very good, is partially tied to his legs. Amongst playoff teams, the Bills were as reliant on super-hero plays from their QB as anyone. Allen still finished 4th in EPA per play and dragged an injured defense to a 12-5 record.

Myles Garrett is an unconventional MVP vote in the modern era, but he broke a record and did it honorably. His sacks per team pass attempt face was the best of all time, and the Browns don't have an elite counterpart to take pressure off. There weren't standout QB options beyond the top-3 this year, so let's reward true greatness.

Jordan Love was 2nd in EPA per play (+0.29) and dealt with injuries at every position around him. He didn't have Christian Watson or Jayden Reed early, then lost Tucker Kraft, then lost C Elgton Jenkins and RT Zach Tom. The OL only was 29th in pressure rate allowed per PFF, and he handled it nearly perfectly. Love got out of trouble by throwing it over the top and quietly buying time in the pocket with subtle pocket movement. He went 9-4-1 in his healthy games, providing Green Bay with the most EPA per dropback through 15 weeks when they clinched the playoffs.

To me, the definition is the best offensive player removing all QBs. They should formally make that switch, as it should be nearly impossible to win MVP as a non-QB if you're voting properly.

Puka Nacua easily led non-QBs in EPA added (+125.4) and success rate (70%). If not for some Davante Adams goal-line scores, that could've even been better. Adams missed a few games late, and Nacua immediately stepped up with 12-225-2, 5-57-1, and 10-76-1 receiving lines. His highlight grabs with one hand or near the sideline were the best in the NFL, and he is one of the most willing targets over the middle and blockers in the ground game as a side hustle. Nacua's 115 total yards per game puts him on all-time lists.

Jaxon Smith-Njigba was 2nd in EPA added (+90.7) and did so by adding downfield ability to his bag in a new offense. His 3.4 yards per route is one of the very best since the stat was created, too. George Pickens wasn't far behind, even if his target numbers weren't quite as high. Pickens was 3rd in EPA added (+88.7) and became infinitely more consistent with better QB play. In fact, the impending free agent was 4th in success rate (64%) among WRs with 50+ targets.

Discussing the NFL all-time sack leader is a waste of time, especially when Myles Garrett was also double- or triple-teamed on 65% of his pass rushes (3rd highest).

Micah Parsons finished with 12.5 sacks in about 12.5 games if we factor in his missed time with a torn ACL and the first couple games directly after the Packers' trade. His per-play impact is only matched by Myles Garrett, and without him, the Packers could've missed the playoffs. ESPN had Parsons 2nd in pass-rush win rate, while PFF graded him with a league-high 69% double- or triple-team rate.

Will Anderson had 12.0 sacks, but his impact is better felt with the advance data. Offenses chipped him at the 3rd-highest rate (24%), and he still was 4th in ESPN's pass-rush win rate. The Texans don't do a lot to scheme him into clean looks either, so Anderson is just winning by being a dog. He's also one of the most impactful super star pass rushers as a run defender, which helped the Texans finish 1st in points allowed.

This was a very down year for the award, but Tetairoa McMillan squeaks by after eclipsing 1,000 receiving yards on a ""playoff team"" as the very clear best skill player on the team. McMillan was the WR20 in receiving yards per game (59.6) and the WR28 in EPA added (+25.8) despite up-and-down QB play as the X receiver. The rookie showcased enough speed to run away from DBs after the catch and threaten vertically. That was the lone question on his otherwise high-floor prospect profile. His upside is similar to Drake London's, and he will be a top-50 pick in fantasy football drafts once again.

Jaxson Dart was nearly my rookie of the year. It was truly that close, even if the Giants record hides what Dart was offering on a per-play basis. He was the QB12 in EPA per play (+0.13) behind an average OL with a underwhelming skill group, as Dart only had 13 dropbacks with Malik Nabers throughout the year. Dart has the physical traits to eventually flirt with top-10 status. He can and wants to push the ball downfield as a passer, can throw with all arm angles, and then is a quality rusher as a scrambler and rusher (when they allow it). In fact, Dart led all QBs in total rushing EPA this year, just edging out Josh Allen. Dart obviously has room to improve with his decision making (see the Brian Flores game), but finishing above Lamar Jackson, Justin Herbert, Trevor Lawrence, Baker Mayfield, and Jalen Hurts in EPA per play as a rookie is nothing short of promising. The Giants have the 5th and 37th overall picks to surround him with more.

Tyler Shough was 24th in EPA per play (+0.03) despite being a very bad OL without a lot of depth in the skill group. By the very end of the year, Shough was hooping by himself. His arm stood out within the first few games, as he can throw with velocity to the sideline and over the middle on backside digs. Shough's age legitimately played to his advantage because he made more full-field reads from within the pocket then almost any non-1st-round rookie of the decade. While he did show plenty of straight-line speed in college, it was shocking at how mobile he looked on the NFL field. He had multiple designed rushing explosives and scores in the red zone. The Saints will absolutely treat him as the clear-cut starter this offseason, and he'd easily fetch a first-half Round 1 pick if we re-drafted today.

They don't get nearly the attention, but Jets RT Armand Membou, Seahawks LG Grey Zabel, Saints LT Kelvin Banks, Cowboys RG Tyler Booker, and Patriots LT Will Campbell all looked like hits in the 1st round. Lions LG Tate Ratledge, Bears LT Ozzy Trapilo, and Texans RT Aireontae Ersery looked like eventual plus starters on Day 2, too.

2nd-round LB Carson Schwesinger made 156 tackles. Before his missed Week 18, that was the 5th most in the NFL. Among off-ball LBs, his 11 tackles for loss were 3rd-most, too. That was the biggest surprise. Schwesinger was strong against blockers and often shedded them to make solo tackles. What wasn't a surprise was his range in coverage. His instincts and eyes were amazing at UCLA, and that traveled to the pros, as he was the Browns' green dot leader in the huddle.

1st-round EDGE Abdul Carter started in a rotation, was suspended for drives multiple times in the middle of the year, and then really dominated in December. If this award was about who was going to be the best long term, Carter is the run-away leader. He ended up 4th in ESPN's Pass Rush Win Rate and ultimately played over 900 snaps with Kayvon Thibodeaux missing some time. Carter's spin move was nasty, and the Giants moved him inside to further copy-cat the Micah Parsons comparison. He was extremely unlucky to only have 4.0 sacks on 73 pressures and 22 QB hits, but offenses who faced him knew to get the ball out quickly or else. Carter was also a quality run defender for his size, only trailing Donovan Ezeiruaku in the draft class in tackles on runs with a negative EPA.

1st-round EDGE James Pearce Jr. racked up a draft-class high 10.5 sacks for the Falcons, who were bailed out by sending the current 13th overall pick away to trade up for the pass rusher. Pearce has great explosion and hustle, making him an excellent choice for outside speed rushes and inside stunts. He simply glides on film and then has plenty of pound-for-pound strength on the occasional bull rush. The Falcons were smart to know where his strengths were and knew to pull him where he couldn't hold up; the run. Pearce only had 6 tackles on runs with negative EPA (compared to Carter's 17), and he was often subbed out on 1st-and-10s when teams could run at him. If he's this effective as a pass rusher each year, who really cares? Pearce is definitely good.

By the way, Eagles 1st-round LB Jihaad Campbell absolutely deserves a shoutout here after some of the crazy plays he made in coverage. Same with Bucs CB Jacob Parrish, Chiefs CB Nohl Williams, EDGE Donovan Ezeiruaku, EDGE Nic Scourton, EDGE Jalon Walker, EDGE Josaiah Stewart, DT Derrick Harmon, DT Kenneth Grant, and DT Mason Graham. It's a good defensive class.

If you haven't heard former (or current) interior offensive linemen talk about what it takes to play offensive tackle, it's worth trying to find clips. Centers can't believe what guards can do, and guards can't believe what tackles can do. To me, that makes ""Protector of the Year"" largely an OT award with an emphasis on the pass game as they ""protect"" the QB if you will.

Garrett Bolles is the leader of the No. 1 seed Broncos, protects Bo Nix's blindside, and is so rarely out of position. He wasn't credited with a single sack allowed this year, though the Broncos will protect their line with screens and boots off of play action. That said, Bolles is an absolute monster out in space because of his athleticism. He can bend, change direction, and close space with remarkable speed for the position. Ditto for the run game. When tasked with holding his spot in the normal dropback game, Bolles showed a lot of fight and recovery quickness, too. On top of that, Bolles played the most snaps amongst left tackles, something the other top left tackles in consideration can't say with Trent Williams, Laremy Tunsil, Andrew Thomas, and Tristan Wirfs all missing time.

It was a slight step down from Hall of Fame play, but Trent Williams turned out another great season in both phases. He was top-20 in Pass Rush Win Rate and 7th in Run Block Win Rate per ESPN's tracking, and the 49ers run behind him in ways most OTs can only dream about. Williams is the 49ers' enforcer in every way, and only the true elite pass rushers have the athleticism to move by him right now. A couple injuries and a tough outing with Myles Garrett break ties away from him winning an award that could be named after him.

It's a close battle between Penei Sewell and Darnell Wright for most hilarious run-block destroyers on the right side. Sewell gets the nod for being slightly more intimidating out in space, but this is the same profile. They have the power to throw guys out the club and hunt back seven players whenever they're pulled or have nobody in front of them on zone runs. They can be beaten by speedy pass rushers, like Micah Parsons, in the pass game, but that's why they are right tackles.

Others in consideration for me are Commanders LT Laremy Tunsil, Giants LT Andrew Thomas, Bucs LT Tristan Wirfs, Rams LT Alaric Jackson, Colts OG Quenton Nelson, Bears OG Joe Thuney, Titans OG Peter Skoronski, Broncos OG Quinn Meinerz, and Dolphins C Aaron Brewer.

First off, this reward deserves nearly zero seriousness. It's also an award that really should be split into two. There's a return from injury component, and then there's a breakout candidate component. It's hard to weigh one versus the other, and it'd be better if there was one of each.

The best blend of seriousness of injury and on-field impact was Aidan Hutchinson, who broke his damn leg in half last year. For a pass rusher who relies on power and bending corners, it was not a given that he'd return to the level he did in 2025. He racked up the most total pressures on the 4th-highest pressure rate according to PFF, leading to 14.5 sacks and the 3rd-most QB hits. Hutchinson was also chipped at the 4th-highest rate, too. Equally impressive to his production was his availability and workload. Hutchinson was the only edge rusher to reach 1,000 snaps this year.

A close second was Christian McCaffrey, who checked very similar boxes. He had a career-high 413 touches, leading to another 2,000-yard season. McCaffrey was the only Niner to stay healthy the entire year, and his route running was weaponized as the other receivers missed time. As usual, he danced around bad run blocking, too. The only things to nitpick versus Hutchinson is positional value and the seriousness of injury, as CMC didn't have surgery or miss the early offseason while in rehab. He was too busy winning all of us fantasy football championships instead.

Because it's an arbitrary award, the Philip Rivers experience was so wild to me that it deserves some recognition, just like Damar Hamlin deserved recognition after his experience (and he's received comeback votes in 3 separate seasons since his injury). Rivers hadn't played in 4.75 seasons and was a 44-year-old grandpa fresh off the couch. Given the stakes, the Colts were serious about this, and Rivers held his own. If he would've won a game, played the rest of the year, or by some miracle made the playoffs, Rivers absolutely would've been my 1st-place vote.

Others in consideration are Cowboys QB Dak Prescott, Steelers RT Troy Fautanu, Saints WR Chris Olave, Patriots WR Stefon Diggs, WR Christian Watson, and Giants LT Andrew Thomas.

The Seahawks only had a preseason team total of 8.5 wins. They finished with 14, in a loaded division, in a loaded conference. Mike MacDonald had three difficult decisions to make in the offseason, nailing all of them by hiring OC Klint Kubiak, upgrading with QB Sam Darnold, and trading away DK Metcalf. He deserves credit for some of that. More importantly, the Seahawks have a great culture in the building and their defense is arguably the best. MacDonald is the best defensive designer in football right now, as he minors in just about everything without a clear major in everything. His versatility makes him able to handle the Shanahan tree and the spread offenses. As a tie breaker, MacDonald's special teams was amongst the best in the NFL. Everything about the Seahawks is very professional right now.

If the 49ers win Week 18, they would've had the No. 1 seed and Kyle Shanahan walks away with the award, one he should be amongst the finalist for every single year. The Niners went 5-3 with Mac Jones, then 7-2 with Brock Purdy who he's developed into a real top-12 QB. His OL has Trent Williams and not a lot else, yet the ball moved at will without Brandon Aiyuk, Ricky Pearsall, and/or George Kittle. No excuses. Just finishing 3rd in offensive success rate. The 49ers being in the hunt for the top seed while the defense collapsed due to injury is another feather in Shanny's cap.

The Bears were 26th in EPA per play last year, added Ben Johnson (and a new OL and multiple skill guys), then finished 8th in EPA per play in 2025. That's coaching. Chicago created an identity with outside zone runs, especially after an early-season bye, and the Caleb Williams began settling in as he had more time to learn under Johnson. Perhaps most overlooked is how good the OL turned out despite having zero chemistry together. ESPN's Block Win Rate graded them 1st on pass plays and 6th on run plays. There's a lot of communication required to pull that off. Ultimately, the Bears won a division that entirely finished above .500, and the defense was only 20th in EPA per play.

Others in consideration were Liam Coen, Sean McVay, and Mike Vrabel.

The Patriots went from 27th to 1st in EPA per play in one year, with the same QB. Coach Mike Vrabel deserves plenty of credit for seeing the vision and making the hire, but OC Josh McDaniels was the leader and play caller of the offense. He got the most of rotations at WR, TE, and RB by only using each player to their strengths, and then he navigated an on-paper bottom-5 OL with great design. The Patriots leaned into their pass-game strengths at the end of the year, and McDaniels did a bit of everything in both phases. This all after taking a year off. Well done.

The most exciting defense every year is whichever one Brian Flores is coaching. Yet again, Flo dialed up the most blitzes. This year, it was by a magnitude of 175 more than the defense in 2nd. It sounds like a dangerous strategy, but the Vikings used smart safeties to navigate things in the secondary and often stayed in two-high coverages despite bringing an extra rusher. The complexity is a death sentence for any rookie QB or play caller, and that makes him a massive asset for the Vikings, who were 4th in EPA per play allowed. They do so without having any All Pro talent.

The Chargers aren't nearly as exciting on defense, but DC Jesse Minter is as sound and complex with his zone coverages as you'll see. Los Angeles was 2nd-lowest in their man coverage rate, rather living in the two-high zone world. In it, the Chargers had the best PFF coverage grade, allowing roaming back-seven players like Derwin James to use their instincts to their maximum. They ultimately finished 5th in EPA per play allowed even with EDGE Khalil Mack having an IR stint and after losing EDGE Joey Bosa and DT Poona Ford this offseason. All of the play callers ahead of him on defense have been head coaches before. Minter is likely next.",https://images.ctfassets.net/l8eoog2wur2i/3USg6a1I0DquMDjTPc1kdO/89042832502be3e55fee85121aa504ff/USATSI_27933849_168415901_lowres.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 14:00:20.633964

McCarthy and Jefferson looked more in sync Sunday than they did in the quarterback's first nine starts.","MINNEAPOLIS — It can sometimes be hard to accept, but beauty exists in the struggle.

J.J. McCarthy stood behind the lectern in the U.S. Bank Stadium depths Sunday afternoon, his face flush with emotions that matched up with his performance this season — namely confidence and uncertainty.

The finale of McCarthy's first year as a starter was never going to be as important as the ending of Harrison Smith's 14th season or the likely swan song of C.J. Ham's decade-long run as a homegrown Viking. But Week 18 of the 2025 slate was supposed to offer a good look at McCarthy's skills and his punctuation of a body of work in a roller-coaster campaign in which he won 60 percent of his 10 starts.

It's true, McCarthy had plenty of positive moments in the 16-3 win over Green Bay. It's also true that people outside the organization might overlook them and focus on another game impacted by injury.

After making a quick pass to Justin Jefferson in the third quarter, McCarthy let Head Coach Kevin O'Connell know he was experiencing difficulty in his throwing hand. Instead of trying to play through the pain and risk not gripping the football properly, he made a hand-off of the huddle to Max Brosmer.

""I feel like I had to make a grown-man decision,"" he emphasized in his postgame press conference.

Admittedly more aware of the game situation than he was two weeks ago when he ignored signs of the injury that prevented him from effectively clenching the football and stayed in the game at the Giants until a sack-fumble returned for a TD led him to the locker room, McCarthy sided with caution Sunday.

The 22-year-old considered it one of the toughest decisions of his life so far, but the correct one. Brosmer wound up replacing him and playing the final quarter-and-a-half of Minnesota's 9-8 campaign.

""I was happy I made the right decision,"" McCarthy said, harkening back to the Week 16 wisdom he gained. ""Feeling the momentum of the game and how well the defense is playing, when it gets to a point where you feel like your body is going to say, 'No, you can't do that,' you've got to put your ego aside.""

""I had to do what's best for the team,"" he added.

O'Connell appreciated the quarterback's mental and physical improvements.

""I think he's grown like a lot of young quarterbacks do,"" the coach assessed. ""And I'm excited about where he's ending the season and know that there's some things we can really dive into as a group, and J.J., myself. I look forward to the challenge of being the best version of myself"" for him and the team.

""He had some snaps where there was some real conviction to where he was going with the ball, finding the voids and vacancies, eliminating some things in rhythm, sometimes pre-snap, and then working his way through some coverages,"" O'Connell remarked. ""The only negative was really just the (taunting) penalty that kind of stalled us out. And that's just the competitor that he is. Appreciate everything about him as a competitor, but we just need to avoid ever setting ourselves back like that, especially post-snap.

""But the way he ran the show,"" O'Connell continued. ""Throughout the practice week, even though maybe early on he wasn't feeling 100 or so, he was able to work himself to a place where he absolutely wanted to go, and he took that preparation into the game, and I thought did a lot of good things today.""

McCarthy was sharp on the opening series, connecting with Jefferson for 18 yards after Jordan Mason got the ball rolling with a run for 13. The phenom receiver sprinted toward his sixth consecutive 1,000-yard season with 10 more on a shovel pass in the backfield, and then McCarthy charged out of the pocket, away from pressure, and scrambled for 6, tenaciously stiff-arming Packers linebacker Ty'Ron Hopper on his way to the sideline when he dropped his shoulder and blasted cornerback Keisean Nixon.

It was an awesome display of athleticism and toughness, except McCarthy lost control and barked in Nixon's face afterward. He was flagged for taunting, and Minnesota was pushed back to Green Bay's 38.

That flag reversed momentum — McCarthy called it ""selfish"" and said he got ""carried away"" after thwarting a tackler in that manner for the first time in his career and ""felt so bad"" because he knew he let his teammates down — and the Vikings eventually opted for a 43-yard field goal by Will Reichard.

Unfortunately, McCarthy's inaccuracies stagnated the offense on its next three opportunities.

First, on a possession that began at the Vikings 2, McCarthy targeted Jordan Addison near the right sideline but was too high with his aim, causing the receiver to elevate and bring him down several yards short of the sticks. On the subsequent snap, Mason was stuffed for no gain — and Minnesota punted.

The following drive featured a 12-yard delivery to ""Jets."" But soon after, McCarthy was flushed to his right and tried for tight end Ben Sims on an intermediate route coming across the field. His pass wasn't particularly close, and two plays later Ty Chandler was tackled for a loss of 1, prompting another punt.

Likewise, McCarthy looked for Sims on the first play of the fourth series but didn't put it in a favorable spot; the ball deflected off Sims' hands, which were stretched out to make a spectacular grab, and it was nearly picked off in Vikings territory. Minnesota had to punt, again, after a short carry and incompletion.

It's worth pointing out McCarthy dealt with strong pass rushes on each of those inaccurate passes and he either withstood them, like on the out-breaker to Addison, or he used his legs to buy time and release the rock outside the tackle box. Hurried or not, though, his misses were a bummer because teammates appeared open. To McCarthy's credit, he avoided a sack on 11 pressured drop backs, per Next Gen Stats.

The fifth and sixth series better resembled the first in that McCarthy made a couple brilliant plays that helped him finish 13-for-22 passing (nine throws for first downs) with 174 yards in the initial two frames.

Starting with eight-and-a-half minutes to go in the half, McCarthy hit four passes in a row, the first one going to mammoth tight end Josh Oliver, who wowed the home crowd with a 22-yard catch-and-run. Then, McCarthy spun 17-yarders to Jefferson and Jalen Nailor. The former connection pushed the global star past the 1,000-yard benchmark for the sixth consecutive season and linked him to Vikings Legend Randy Moss and current Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans as the only players in NFL history to begin their careers with that many. The one to Nailor was a strike over the middle that required great anticipation.

Moments later, McCarthy went back to Nailor, but ""Speedy"" was stopped just shy of the line to gain. McCarthy achieved it with a sneak on the ensuing snap, and then Mason pranced around the right side for 13 and a first-and-goal. From there, inaccuracy crept back into the developing quarterback's play.

McCarthy overthrew Addison in the end zone; then he threw the ball at Chandler's feet on an interrupted screen; and he missed Jefferson on an out-breaker to the right, which led to Reichard acing a chip-shot field goal for a 6-0 advantage. It was the kind of outstanding-and-not-so sequence of events that shadowed McCarthy for pretty much the duration of his first season leading the offensive huddle.

Minnesota and McCarthy got one more shot before the intermission, assuming possession at the 1:47 mark — and made the absolute most of it. In succession, Jefferson got 3 on an end-around, Oliver caught a 7-yard pass (but unfortunately picked up an ankle injury and left the game), Chandler nabbed one for 2, McCarthy couldn't link up with Jefferson, and then on third-and-8 with 54 seconds remaining, he waited patiently and let Nailor peel open; McCarthy placed it on the money for a tremendous gain of 26.

McCarthy executed perhaps his best throw of the game in an awfully clutch moment, threading one to Sims, who secured a tight-window pass racing out of bounds at Green Bay's 3 with 42 seconds on the clock. One play and a timeout later, the beloved fullback Ham inspired his hometown fans with a 1-yard TD run.

""That was just something where I've been working so hard and so vigorously and trying so hard to make those throws on the run,"" McCarthy said regarding his laser beam to Sims, one of his favorite flicks of the game. ""You've just got to kind of trust the spot and put it there, and I feel like I did a good job with that.""

Ultimately, McCarthy did what he's done consistently over his first 10 career games: battled adversity, created beautiful moments, persevered through pain, risen to the moment, and left a lot to be desired.

His lone pass in the second half — his 14th completion and 23rd attempt of the game and his 140th and 243rd of the season — went for 8 yards to Jefferson, who managed to top 100 for the first time since the Week 5 game in London when he posted 123 (eight catches for 101 yards). Immediately after, McCarthy motioned to the sideline, knowing he couldn't grip and rip it the way he needed to support the offense.

Although his exit was less than ideal, there was an element of comfort to his performance and how everything unfolded. McCarthy and Jefferson looked more in sync Sunday than they did in the quarterback's first nine starts. And McCarthy's willingness to prioritize his future over his pain tolerance — at the expense, maybe, of an offseason of unwanted narratives — confirmed his real-time maturation.

His handling of it added context to his comments on Wednesday this week — that trying times have formed a ""beautiful picture"" and ""beautiful story."" The meaning and reasoning of it, he elaborated, were in focus. McCarthy's mentality after the game highlighted that he's come a long way in six short months.

""Narratives are something completely out of your control. I can't change [them] no matter what I do. I can go out there, grind through it, and maybe fourth quarter happens, something fluke, and I screw up a lot of my offseason [goals],"" McCarthy said. ""But at the end of the day, you can't deal in those what-ifs.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/btjqpes7v6rqno928now,N,,2026-01-05 17:01:22.204521

The Cincinnati Bengals finished the 2025 NFL season with a 6-11 record after a 20-18 loss against the Cleveland Browns at Paycor Stadium in NFL Week 18.

After starting quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a turf toe injury during a Week 2 win against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Bengals lost eight of their next nine games to fall out of playoff contention.

The Bengals are expected to have more than $69 million in cap space, per overthecap.com, with about $53M in effective cap space and $4.7M in dead money.

The cap-space figure is the eighth-highest among NFL teams.

The contracts of the following players expire at the conclusion of the 2025 season, making them unrestricted free agents (with the exception of quarterback Jake Browning, who will be a restricted free agent):

Bengals players eligible for free agency (per Spotrac)

DE Trey Hendrickson

Age: 31

2025 performance: After Hendrickson agreed in August to a revised deal for the 2025 season that included a $14-million raise, the 2024 NFL sacks leader played in just seven games and recorded four sacks. Hendrickson aggravated a hip injury on a late block from behind by Jets offensive lineman John Simpson during the team's NFL Week 8 loss and missed the rest of the season.

DE Joseph Ossai

Age: 25

2025 performance: In March, the Bengals brought Ossai back on a one-year deal worth $7 million. Ossai had five sacks in the 14 games in which he played. He suffered a right shin injury during the team's NFL Week 14 loss at Buffalo.

S Geno Stone

Age: 26

2025 performance: Stone drew criticism for missed tackles during his second season with the Bengals. He had a 33-yard interception return for a touchdown during the team's NFL Week 12 loss to New England at Paycor Stadium.

QB Joe Flacco

Age: 40

2025 performance: Flacco, who turns 41 on Jan. 16, was 1-5 in his six starts during Burrow's recovery, but endeared himself to Bengals' fans and played through the pain of a sprained AC joint he suffered during the fourth quarter of the team's Week 8 loss to the Jets. During a 47-42 loss to Chicago in Week 9, Flacco became the oldest quarterback in NFL history to pass for 470 yards in a game.

TE Noah Fant

Age: 28

2025 performance: Fant suffered a right ankle injury during the team's NFL Week 15 loss to Baltimore, and suffered a concussion during the team's Week 3 loss to Minnesota, but otherwise stayed healthy. Fant was one of three Bengals to fumble during an ugly first half against the Vikings. He had nine catches for 80 yards over Cincinnati's two games against Pittsburgh. It was one of three times this season a Fant fumble was returned for a touchdown.

G Cordell Volson

Age: 27

2025 performance: Volson, injured during training camp, missed the entire season.

G Lucas Patrick

Age: 32

2025 performance: Signed to a one-year deal in March, Patrick missed most of the season after hurting his calf during the second quarter of the team's season-opening Week 1 win against the Cleveland Browns.

DB Marco Wilson

Age: 26

2025 performance: Wilson saw limited action throughout the season. He was injured during training camp in July, and hurt again when he suffered a right hamstring injury during the team's NFL Week 12 loss to New England.

DB Cam Taylor-Britt

Age: 26

2025 performance: In his fourth season with the team, Taylor-Britt played in eight games before suffering a season-ending, left foot injury during the team's Week 11 loss at Pittsburgh.

OL Dalton Risner

Age: 30

2025 performance: Risner suffered a right calf injury during team's Week 3 loss to Minnesota at U.S. Bank Stadium, but played in 14 games during his first season with the Bengals.

TE Tanner Hudson

Age: 31

2025 performance: Hudson played in 15 games in his third season with the team. The most memorable highlight was a one-handed touchdown reception during the team's 32-14 win Thanksgiving night against the Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium.

DE Cam Sample

Age: 26

2025 performance: Sample played in 14 games, bouncing back from a torn Achilles tendon that cost him the entire 2024 season.

DB Tycen Anderson

Age: 26

2025 performance: Anderson, who missed his rookie season with a hamstring injury and suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 8 of the 2023 season, has played in 34 games over the past two seasons and emerged as a special-teams standout.

QB Jake Browning

Age: 29

2025 performance: Browning, a restricted free agent this offseason, was 0-3 in his three starts for the Bengals after Burrow's injury. Browning was replaced by Flacco after the Bengals' loss to the Detroit Lions in October.

Despite a strong finish, Ward ranked among the league's worst quarterbacks in several key statistical categories.

JACKSONVILLE ― Tennessee Titans rookie quarterback Cam Ward's season is over after he's been ruled out with a right shoulder injury in Week 18 against Jacksonville.

Ward ends his rookie season having started all 17 games, leading the team to three wins. He threw 15 touchdowns with seven interceptions and ran for two more touchdowns, including the one on which he injured his shoulder. He finishes his rookie season with 3,169 passing yards, a Titans franchise record among rookie passers.

After starting the season slow, Ward threw multiple touchdowns in each of his last four complete games, leading the Titans to wins over Cleveland and Kansas City during that stretch.

Looking at the season in totality, Ward finished among the league's worst quarterbacks statistically. He came into Week 18 ranked in the bottom three in the NFL in completion percentage, passer rating, yards per attempt and passing success rate.

The Titans drafted Ward with the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, trying to capture the magic Ward spun in his college stops at Incarnate Ward, Washington State and Miami. Ward left Miami as the NCAA Division I's all-time leader in touchdown passes.

Without Ward, the Titans will turn to Brandon Allen for the remainder of Sunday's game versus the Jaguars.

The Titans head into the offseason with a coaching search ranking as the top priority.

In his 12th and final start as a rookie, Jaxson Dart completed 22 of 32 passes for 230 yards and two touchdowns for a career-high 110.2 passer rating. He also ran five times for 32 yards.

Dart's highlight of the day was an impromptu backhand flip to tight end Daniel Bellinger, who caught it and weaved his way through defenders for a 29-yard touchdown to give the Giants a 16-10 halftime lead.

Not to be outdone, running back Tyrone Tracy Jr. scored on a 13-yard touchdown pass from Dart in the third quarter and fellow running back Devin Singletary added to the highlight reel with a successful two-point conversion pass to wide receiver Darius Slayton. Singletary took a direct snap, faked a handoff to Dart going the other way, and scrambled before finding Slayton in the end zone for a 24-10 lead.

Tracy recorded a career-high 159 yards from scrimmage on 18 carries for 103 yards and eight catches for 56 yards and the touchdown. A fifth-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, Tracy became the third Giant in franchise history with 1,000 scrimmage yards in each of his first two seasons, joining wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and running back Saquon Barkley.

Dart ends his rookie campaign with 24 total touchdowns, including a franchise-record nine rushing scores. The No. 25 overall draft pick trails only Charlie Conerly (27 in 1948) and Daniel Jones (26 in 2019) for the most total touchdowns in Giants history by a rookie quarterback.

Dart joined Eli Manning (2004) as the only rookie quarterbacks in franchise history to beat the Cowboys.

Singletary punched in his fifth rushing touchdown of the season, his most since also having five in 2022 with the Bills.

After reaching 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career, wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson was inactive for the season finale due to a rib injury. Robinson ends his fourth season with 92 catches for 1,014 and four touchdowns. His 92 catches are sixth-most in a single season in franchise history (his 93 catches from a year ago are fifth). Robinson and Odell Beckham Jr. are the only Giants ever to record multiple seasons with at least 90 catches.

Gunner Olszewski made his first start at wide receiver since 2022, when he was a member of the Steelers. He shattered his career highs on Sunday with eight catches for 103 yards. An accomplished return specialist, Olszewski had just 17 catches for 223 yards in his previous 80 career games (four starts).

Rookie Marcus Mbow started at left tackle for the second consecutive game with Andrew Thomas (hamstring) on injured reserve. The fifth-round pick from Purdue finishes his rookie campaign with three starts (including one in Week 9 at right tackle) in 13 games. Austin Schlottmann also lined up at center for John Michael Schmitz, who missed the last two games of the season with a finger injury.

WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT THE DEFENSE

Linebacker Bobby Okereke recorded a takeaway for the second consecutive week, recovering a botched snap by Dak Prescott on the Cowboys' opening drive. The Giants scored a field goal on the ensuing possession for the first points of the game. Okereke picked off Geno Smith last week for the linebacker's first interception since 2023.

Okereke wasn't done there. The Giants' club winner for Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year later intercepted Joe Milton III, who had replaced Prescott in the second half.

Outside linebacker Brian Burns finished his third Pro Bowl season with a career-high 16.5 sacks, tying Jason Pierre-Paul (2011) for fourth in a single season in Giants history.

Burns did not have a sack in the finale, but he did record his 31st quarterback hit of the season. It snapped a tie with Leonard Williams (30 in 2020) for the most by any Giant since the stat began being tracked in 2006.

With one more tackle for loss against the Cowboys, Burns also increased his season total to 22, the most by a Giant since Pierre-Paul had 23 in 2011.

,,2026-01-05 12:01:08+00:00,Pro Football Rumors,Titans' Cam Ward Suffers Shoulder Injury - Pro Football Rumors,Nikhil Mehta,,,,,https://www.profootballrumors.com/2026/01/sprained-ac-joint-fear-for-titans-qb-cam-ward,"Titans quarterback Cam Ward‘s rookie season came to an unceremoniously early ending today when he exited today’s season finale with an injury.
Ward has been initially diagnosed with a Grade 3 AC joint sprain in his right shoulder, per The Athletic’s Jeff Howe and Titans insider Paul Kuharsky.

Ward has been initially diagnosed with a Grade 3 AC joint sprain in his right shoulder, per The Athletic’s Jeff Howe and Titans insider Paul Kuharsky.

Ward landed on shoulder of his throwing arm while reaching for the end zone on the Titans’ first drive of Sunday’s game in Jacksonville. Jaguars linebacker Foyesade Oluokun landed on top of the No. 1 overall pick, driving him harder into the ground. Ward briefly went into the blue tent before making his way to the locker room and was seen later on the sideline in sweats.

Despite the injury, the 23-year-old started every game for the Titans in his rookie campaign. Though Ward had appeared on the team’s injury report back in Week 4 with ankle/calf issues, and though Ward was the most-sacked quarterback in the NFL this year (55, tied with Raiders quarterback Geno Smith), Ward had played 100 percent of the team’s offensive snaps up to that point of the season. Backup quarterback Brandon Allen‘s first snaps today were Tennessee’s first offensive snaps without Ward on the field this year.

AC joint sprain recovery times vary depending on the degree of severity. A milder Grade 1 sprain may take a couple weeks to shake off, whereas a Grade 3 sprain could take several months to recover from. The team saw former starter Will Levis suffer an AC joint sprain early in his second year with the team. He was cleared after the Titans’ bye week and started the next game without missing any time, but he reaggravated the injury in his first game after the injury and was sidelined for the next three weeks. Levis underwent season-ending shoulder surgery in July before this season, but it’s unclear if the procedure was related to the AC joint sprain or a more recent injury.

Ward’s injury ended a rookie season that he will want to quickly move on from. Coming into the final week of the season, Ward ranked 25th in the NFL in passing yards per game and dead last in touchdowns per pass attempt. As mentioned above, he also led the league in sacks taken and yards lost from sacks. Many of these troubling stats can be attributed to Ward adjusting to the speed difference from college to the pros, but the quality of the players around him should not be ignored.

While Ward certainly needs to get the ball out quicker in certain situations, he was under pressure on 27.9 percent of his pass attempts, the third-highest percentage in the league. His receivers also racked up the 12th-most drops in the NFL and finished 27th in the NFL in yards after catch. Ward did show bright spots, though, like only throwing seven interceptions, good for an interception rate of 1.3 percent — the third-best such figure in the NFL this year. He also was able to keep plays alive with his legs and turn broken plays into highlights, something he was known to do in college, as well.

All-in-all, the Titans still believe that Ward is their franchise quarterback, but his development is going to be crucial as he looks to take another step forward in Year 2. The team will likely have Ward undergo some testing to determine the exact severity of today’s injury, and they’ll hope that the resulting recovery time won’t keep him from being available for OTAs in May.

Despite being listed as questionable for Week 18, Adams is not expected to play.","Week 18 in the NFL can mean everything — and nothing — to a team. For some franchises — like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or New York Giants — there's actually a lot on the line during the final week of the regular season. For others — like the Miami Dolphins and Houston Texans — there's not a ton at stake that is going to drastically change the team's plans moving forward.

Because of that, teams treat the final week of the regular season much differently than every other week. A team that has already secured a postseason spot might opt to rest players, even if they can still move up or down in the seeding. A team that has no shot at the playoffs might opt to rest players too, not risking a catastrophic injury to a key star in a meaningless game.

Now that the final week of the regular season has arrived, here is a full list of inactives for Week 18, including key players like Nico Collins and Justin Herbert, who are reportedly sitting out:

Saints vs. Falcons

Saints inactives: S Ugo Amadi, QB Spencer Rattler, WR Chris Olave, RB Alvin Kamara, OL Xavier Truss, DT Bryan Bresee, DT Nathan Shepherd

Falcons inactives: P Trenton Gill, ILB Ronnie Harrison, DL Brandon Dorlus, OL Michael Jerrell, WR Casey Washington, WR Malik Heath

Browns vs. Bengals

Browns inactives: TE Harold Fannin Jr., T Jeremiah Byers, C Kingsley Eguakun, WR Jamari Thrash, TE David Njoku, DT Sam Kamara

Bengals inactives: QB Jake Browning (Emergency 3rd QB), WR Charlie Jones, CB Josh Newton, S Daijahn Anthony, DE Joseph Ossai, TE Cam Grandy, DT Jordan Jefferson

Advertisement

Colts vs. Texans

Colts inactives: CB Sauce Gardner, DT Eric Johnson II, S Reuben Lowery III, TE Will Mallory, S George Odum, QB Philip Rivers

Texans inactives: CB Kamari Lassiter, WR Nico Collins, WR Braxton Berrios, QB Graham Mertz, RB Nick Chubb, LB Jamal Hill, OT Trent Brown

Key absence: Nico Collins, WR, Houston Texans

The Houston Texans are safely in the playoffs, though the team could see its seeding move quite a bit depending on what happens in Week 18. The Texans enter the week as the No. 5 seed in the AFC, though the team could move as high as No. 3 and as low as No. 7 based on what happens during the final week of the regular season.

Advertisement

Despite that, star wideout Nico Collins is not expected to play when the Texans take on the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. Collins is not injured, and is considered a healthy scratch for the contest.

The 26-year-old is coming off yet another strong season, in which he hauled in 71 catches for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns. That performance earned Collins his second straight Pro Bowl nod.

Instead of pushing Collins for another week, the Texans will give the star some rest before the playoffs begin. After missing some time last season, Collins has stayed relatively healthy in 2025, missing just one game this season. Still, the Texans don't want to take any chances with their star ahead of the postseason.

Betting impact: Despite Collins' absence, there was minimal line movement, with the Texans going from -10 to -10.5.

Titans vs. Jaguars

Titans inactives: S Amani Hooker, OLB Arden Key, OG Drew Moss, OG Garrett Dellinger, OT Brandon Crenshaw-Dickson, TE Gunnar Helm

Jaguars inactives: CB Keith Taylor, OL PAtrick Mekari, TE Hunter Long, TE Patrick Herbert, DL Emmanuel Ogbah, DT Maason Smith

Packers vs. Vikings

Packers inactives: QB Malik Willis, LB Quay Walker, RB Josh Jacobs, WR Dontayvion Wicks, S Xavier McKinney, OT Zach Tom, LB Edgerrin Cooper

Vikings inactives: WR Myles Price, QB John Wolford (Emergency 3rd QB), QB Brett Rypien, RB Aaron Jones Sr., OT Walter Routes, TE T.J. Hockenson

Key absence: Jordan Love, QB, Green Bay Packers

The Green Bay Packers are the No. 7 seed in the NFC. The team can't move out of that spot. Because of that, Jordan Love, despite being cleared from a concussion, isn't expected to play in Week 18.

Advertisement

And with backup Malik Willis also dealing with injuries, the Packers announced earlier in the week Clayton Tune will get the start against the Minnesota Vikings. Willis will be inactive for the contest, and Love will serve as Tune's backup.

Since the news was announced previously, Love's absence shouldn't come as a surprise. Running back Josh Jacobs is also out.

Betting impact: Once it became clear the Packers were resting starters, the Vikings' line jumped from -6.5 to -12.5.

Cowboys vs. Giants

Cowboys inactives: LB DeMarvion Overshown, CB Shavon REvel, S Alijah Clark, DT Jay Toia, DT Perrion Winfrey

Giants inactives: S Jevón Holland, WR Ryan Miller, WR Jalin Hyatt, RB Dante Miller, OLB Caleb Murphy, TE Theo Johnson, QB Russell Wilson (Emergency 3rd QB)

NFL players expected to sit out in Week 18

The following players don't play in the early slate in Week 18, but are expected to sit Sunday:

Chargers vs. Broncos

Chargers inactives: DB Elijah Molden, S Derwin James Jr., RB Omarion Hampton, QB Justin Herbert, OLB Tuli Tuipulotu, OL Jamaree Salyer, C Bradley Bozeman

Broncos inactives: CB Reese Taylor, OLB Que Robinson, LB Dre Greenlaw, OT Geron Christian, TE Marcedes Lewis, DL John Franklin-Myers

Key absence: Justin Herbert, QB, Los Angeles Chargers

The Los Angeles Chargers have little to play for in Week 18. The team can move around in the AFC playoff seeding, but would still go on the road for every one of its first-round matchups.

Advertisement

Because of that, quarterback Justin Herbert is expected to sit, along with running back Omarion Hampton, pass rusher Khalil Mack and safety Derwin James. Herbert, Mack and James aren't battling injuries and are expected to miss the game against the Denver Broncos due to rest.

Herbert turned in another solid season with the Chargers. The 27-year-old finished the year with 3,727 yards and 26 touchdowns.

Key absence: Omarion Hampton, RB, Los Angeles Chargers

Rookie running back Omarion Hampton is also expected to sit for the Chargers in Week 18. Hampton missed a significant amount of time as a rookie thanks to an ankle injury. He played in just nine games, rushing for 545 yards and four touchdowns.

Advertisement

Hampton will miss Week 18 due to an ankle injury as well. He did not practice all week, and was ruled out for the game after the Friday practice report. His absence — unlike Herbert's or Mack's shouldn't come as a major surprise.

Hampton is hoping to play in the team's first playoff game, so the injury isn't expected to be serious.

Betting impact: Once it became clear the Chargers would treat Week 18 as a rest week, the line moved from Broncos -7.5 to Broncos -14, a significant jump.

Dolphins vs. Patriots

Dolphins inactives: QB Tua Tagovailoa (Emergency 3rd QB), QB Cam Miller, WR Jaylen Waddle, RB De'Von Achane, S Minkah Fitzpatrick, LB Chop Robinson, OL Austin Jackson

Patriots inactives: LB Harold Landry III, LB Robert Spillane, OT Marcus Bryant, G Jared Wilson, G Caedan Wallace, NT Khyiris Tonga, QB Tommy DeVito (emergency third QB)

Advertisement

Key absence: De'Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins

At 7-9, the Miami Dolphins have nothing to play for in Week 18. With the season essentially over, star running back De'Von Achane will reportedly sit out the final game of the regular season. He won't be the only key player on the team to miss the contest against the New England Patriots, as wideout Jaylen Waddle is also expected to sit.

It turned out to be an exceptional third season for Achane, who rushed for a career-high 1,350 yards and scored eight rushing touchdowns. He led the league in yards per attempt at 5.7.

Achane was also a threat as a receiver, gaining 488 yards through the air and scoring four receiving touchdowns. That performance earned him his first-ever trip to the Pro Bowl.

Advertisement

Given that there's little on the line for the Dolphins in Week 18, the move was likely made to ensure Achane stays healthy heading into the offseason. The Dolphins are a team that could experience major change after Week 18, as head coach Mike McDaniel could be fired and former starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa could also be on his way out. That could make Achane the most important player on the team's offense next season, which is a good reason to not risk a major injury in Week 18.

Key absence: Jaylen Waddle, WR, Miami Dolphins

Much like Achane, the Dolphins likely feel there's no reason to risk one of their top offensive players in a meaningless game. Also like Achane, Waddle could be one of the most impactful offensive players on the team next season, especially if the Dolphins also move on from Tyreek Hill.

Waddle finished his fifth NFL season with 910 receiving yards and six touchdowns. He hasn't hit the highs he showed early in his career, but remains a strong player who could take a step forward if Hill is shipped out in the offseason.

Advertisement

Betting impact: With both Achane and Waddle expected to sit vs. the Patriots, the Dolphins' line moved from +11.5 to +13.

Cardinals vs. Rams

Cardinals inactives: CB Max Melton, CB Kalen King, TE Rivaldo Fairweather, LB Austin Keys, OL Evan Brown, DL P.J. Mustipher, K Joshua Karty

Rams inactives: WR Davante Adams, TE Terrance Ferguson, RB Jarquez Hunter, CB Josh Wallace, CB Darious Williams, OL Kevin Dotson

Key absence: Davante Adams, WR, Los Angeles Rams

Los Angeles Rams wideout Davante Adams was able to return to practice in limited fashion during the week, but will receive another week of rest for his hamstring. Despite being listed as questionable for Week 18, Adams is not expected to play. He reportedly wanted to get out there, but head coach Sean McVay told him to rest up for the playoffs.

Advertisement

Adams is coming off an excellent season, in which he hauled in an NFL-leading 14 touchdowns in his first year with the Rams.

Jets vs. Bills

Jets inactives: QB Tyrod Taylor (Emergency 3rd QB), WR Tyler Johnson, RB Breece Hall, CB Brandon Stephens, CB Qwan'tez Stiggers, DL Michael Clemons, TE Jelani Woods

Bills inactives: LB Terrel Bernard, WR Brandin Cooks, S Jordan Poyer, DE Greg Rousseau, OT Dion Dawkins, DL DaQuan Jones, DE Joey Bosa

Lions vs. Bears

Lions inactives: LB Alex Anzalone, OL Kayode Awosika, S Thomas Harper, WR Dominic Lovett, DL Alim McNeill, OL Penei Sewell

Bears inactives: QB Case Keenum, DB Nick McCloud, OL Ozzy Trapilo, WR Rome Odunze, LB Ruben Hyppolite II, DL Joe Tyron-Shoyinka

Chiefs vs. Raiders

Chiefs inactives: WR Xavier Worthy, RB Isiah Pacheco, CB Melvin Smith, DE George Karlaftis, DE Tyreke Smith, OG Trey Smith, DT Mike Pennel

Raiders inactives: QB Geno Smith, S Terrell Edmunds, CB Chigozie Anusiem, RB Raheem Mostert, G Dylan Parham, DT Adam Butler, DT Brodric Martin

Hamilton collided with teammate Alohi Gilman while breaking up an Aaron Rodgers pass intended for Calvin Austin III. Hamilton and Gilman’s helmets hit each other, and they both left the game for a concussion check. Gilman entered the injury tent first, was cleared and returned three plays later. Hamilton entered next and was then carted to the locker room before eventually being ruled out.

The Steelers ended the drive with a touchdown to tie the score 10-10. Hamilton’s loss is major for the Ravens, especially as they are playing to keep their season alive. Before he left the game, Hamilton led the team with nine tackles.

Sunday night’s winner will earn the No. 4 seed in the AFC and host the Houston Texans on Monday, Jan. 12 in the wild-card round. The loser will have their season end.

What this means for the Ravens

Hamilton has been the Ravens’ best defensive player all season, and he was having another good game tonight with nine tackles. His ability to occupy many roles and play them well gave defensive coordinator Zach Orr flexibility. Hamilton plays deep safety, nickel corner, dime linebacker and edge rusher. He blitzes and he’s a factor in both the Ravens run and pass defense.

1 overall pick in 2025, Ward's rookie season got off to a discouraging start.","Tennessee Titans rookie quarterback Cam Ward is out for the remainder of Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars with a right shoulder injury. Ward suffered the injury after diving into the end zone for a rushing touchdown on Tennessee's first offensive drive.

Fewer than five minutes into the game, Ward kept the ball on a designed run and dove for the goal line. He came down on his right shoulder, and as he did, Jaguars linebacker Foyesade Oluokun landed on top of him with a lot of force.

Ward was slow to get up, and when he returned to the sideline, he entered the injury tent. After exiting, he walked back to the locker room. The Titans quickly labeled Ward as questionable before ruling him out.

The injury ends Ward's bid to play every offensive snap in his rookie campaign. He was the only quarterback with that distinction coming into the day.

Before exiting the game, Ward helped Tennessee get off to a fast start. He completed all three of his passes for 52 yards and rushed for 11 yards and the aforementioned touchdown.

Brandon Allen entered the game in relief of Ward, and he will have the reins the rest of the way. Because fo Ward's durability and availability, Allen didn't see any action in the first 17 weeks of the season. A sixth-round pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, Allen completed 17 of 30 pass attempts for 56 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions as a backup with the San Francisco 49ers last season.

Ward's late-season surge comes to an abrupt end

The No. 1 overall pick in 2025, Ward's rookie season got off to a discouraging start. Between rookie mistakes, a shaky offensive line and an unimpressive wide receiver room, Ward struggled to gain traction at the NFL level.

However, around a month ago, something seemed to click. He started playing more consistently, and the Titans started finding the end zone with a little more frequency. Dating back to the Titans' Week 14 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ward showed legitimate signs of progress.

Over that four-game stretch, Ward completed 59.2% of his passes for eight touchdowns and just one interception while averaging 191.5 yards per game. Ward also became the first Titans quarterback to throw at least two touchdown passes in four consecutive weeks since Ryan Tannehill accomplished that feat in 2020.

In the 12 games prior to that run, Ward struggled, especially when it came to protecting the football. Over that span, Ward tossed seven interceptions to six interceptions, which came in consecutive games. He also fumbled the ball nine times, and a number of those came as a result of him trying to do too much in the backfield.

Ward's improved late-season play generated a clear impact on the team overall -- the Titans were 2-2 in those four games and averaged 26.7 points per game. On the season, Tennessee averaged just 17.3 points per game prior to Sunday. Rookie receivers Chimere Diek and Elic Ayomanor also emerged to make some key plays for the Titans.

Ward ends his season with a 59.8% completion percentage, 3,169 yards, 15 touchdowns and seven interceptions, but those numbers don't tell the whole story. Ward showed flashes of greatness down the stretch, and that should encourage the Titans as they look toward the 2026 season.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/04/711abae8-686b-4116-8b1d-ba219aeae401/thumbnail/1200x675/b6cba1ee0350ddbdd87e589aa2245bae/gettyimages-2254633528-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 02:21:44.264096

He also had 12 rushing touchdowns over the season.

Though he wasn't 100 percent sure at the time after the Jets game if he won the title or not, Cook talked about how important a title like that is for all running backs across the league.

""It means a lot. Just something nobody in my family has done, just nothing somebody has done here [with the Bills] in a long time. So, it'd be special,"" Cook said. ""As a running back, that's everybody's goal just to win the rushing title.""

Just four years in, Cook has proven to be one of the league's best running backs. It's the first year a Bills running back has earned the title since O.J. Simpson did so in 1976.

Cook's 2025 campaign has been one to remember. He has the best vision of any current running back, a wealth of knowledge when it comes to NFL offenses and packs a punch when breaking tackles.

With another year of four-figure rushing numbers, Cook has now passed 1,000 rushing yards in three straight seasons becoming the third Bill to do so (Thurman Thomas and O.J. Simpson).

""He's the best back in football,"" Allen said. ""He should be in the running for every award. He's an absolute stud. We love having him. He makes our offense go.""

Cook's most impactful game this season was Week 8 against the Carolina Panthers where the RB rushed for 216 yards and two touchdowns in a 40-9 win. It was the most rushing yards in a game by a Bill since 1976 (Simpson – 273 yards).

""The look in his eye each week, the intensity that he shows up with, it's really been influential on our whole football team,"" head coach Sean McDermott said of Cook. ""Guys see that. That's kind of a little bit unique for a running back position player to have that type of impact on the whole team…Very few people work harder than him.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bills/h08ok7gluuvz2knuvbo5,N,,2026-01-05 02:22:03.599202

Ward finished last in the NFL among starters in QBR (32.2) and took 55 sacks, tied for most in the league.
Henley finished the season with a team-high 103 tackles (five for loss), 3.5 sacks and two interceptions.
The ninth-year vet finished the season with 33 tackles (five for loss) and two sacks in 14 games (one start).
The BYU grad entered the final week of the regular season ranked second in the NFL in punting average (51 yards per punt).","Although it was an overall rocky rookie season for Cam Ward (Washington State) – including a tough break in the finale that saw the Tennessee quarterback leave the game early with an injury – there were also flashes of promise from the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft.

Ward ended his season on the sideline with his throwing arm in a sling after suffering a shoulder injury in the first quarter of the Titans’ 41-7 loss at Jacksonville on Sunday. He completed 3 of 3 passes for 52 yards and scored on a 7-yard run to end Tennessee’s first drive – he sustained the injury when a defender landed on him as he fell across the goal line and did not return. According to the Athletic, Ward’s injury is believed to be a Grade 3 AC sprain, which typically requires six to nine months of recovery time.

Until Sunday, Ward hadn’t missed a play during his rookie season. He was the only NFL QB to have taken every snap for his team through Week 17, per ESPN.

The Titans finished 3-14, but Ward showed clear strides late in the year. Over the last seven games prior to Sunday, he threw for 1,357 yards and totaled 11 touchdowns against one interception, leading Tennessee to two wins in that stretch.

On the season, Ward passed for 3,159 yards and 15 TDs with seven interceptions on a 59.8% completion rate. He also rushed for two TDs.

Ward finished last in the NFL among starters in QBR (32.2) and took 55 sacks, tied for most in the league. But he was put in a difficult situation with a rebuilding Titans team, and exhibited some of the talents that made him a pro prospect at WSU (2022-23) and a Heisman finalist at Miami (2024) – his improvisational skill in the pocket and his arm talent, the ability to complete highlight-reel passes from difficult angles, stood out.

• Efton Chism III (EWU), coming off a memorable game last weekend, continued to show his offensive value, catching a sideline pass for 35 yards on New England’s second possession.

That was Chism’s only target during the Patriots’ 38-10 win over Miami, but the undrafted rookie receiver has to feel encouraged about his future after seeing his offensive role expand in the past two weeks. He had his first-career reception and first-career TD in a win over the New York Jets last weekend.

Chism logged 75 yards and a score on three catches during the regular season, and averaged 23.9 yards on 16 kick returns since making his NFL debut in October. It’ll be interesting to see how the Pats employ the EWU great going forward.

• Kyle Williams (WSU), a rookie receiver for the Pats, gained 5 yards on a WR sweep run, but recorded no other stats.

A third-round draft pick, Williams finished the regular season with 209 receiving yards and three TD caches on 10 grabs. He also averaged 26.4 yards on 11 kick returns.

• Christian Elliss (Idaho), a starting linebacker for New England, matched the team-high with eight tackles.

The fifth-year pro finished the season second on the team with a career-high 94 tackles, adding three pass breakups and one forced fumble during his second full season with the Pats and first year as a consistent NFL starter. An undrafted player in 2021, Elliss had his most productive season yet and solidified himself as a solid pro defender.

• Jaden Hicks (WSU), a backup safety for Kansas City, recorded three tackles and a PBU during the Chiefs’ 14-12 loss to Las Vegas.

Hicks played a limited defensive role in his second season after being selected in the fourth round of the 2024 draft. He finished the season with 42 tackles and half a sack. Hicks didn’t have an interception after recording three during his promising rookie campaign.

• Jaylen Watson (WSU), a starting cornerback for Kansas City, was placed on IR late last month with a groin injury and missed the season finale.

Watson has blossomed into a key defender after being selected in the seventh round of the 2022 draft. He established himself as an every-down starter this year, the final season of his rookie contract with Kansas City, and boosted his value on the free-agency market, registering a career-high 64 tackles, two interceptions and two sacks.

A two-time Super Bowl champion with the Chiefs, Watson posted a possible farewell letter to Kansas City via Instagram on Friday.

”Dear CHIEFS KINGDOM, if this is the last ride I truly thank you for all the passion and support you’ve shown over the past 4 years,” Watson wrote. “The best 4 years of my life. From a 7th round draft pick out of Augusta, Ga I felt welcomed since the first day I walked in the building. Never in a million years I could’ve imagined being a 2X (Super Bowl) champ.”

• Daiyan Henley (WSU), a starting linebacker for the Los Angeles Chargers, was held out of the team’s 19-3 loss to Denver as L.A. rested several key players ahead of the playoffs.

Henley finished the season with a team-high 103 tackles (five for loss), 3.5 sacks and two interceptions. A first-year team captain, Henley has become an NFL notable in three short seasons after being selected in the third round of the 2023 draft.

• Kaden Elliss (Idaho), a standout linebacker for Atlanta, totaled six tackles and one pass breakup during the Falcons’ 19-17 win over New Orleans.

Elliss received the fifth-highest PFF grade (84.6) among defenders in the game.

The seventh-year pro started all 17 games this season – his third straight season doing so. A first-year team captain and rising name in the NFL, Elliss led the Falcons with 107 tackles (10 for loss) on the season, and posted 3.5 sacks.

• Frankie Luvu (WSU), a linebacker for Washington, had one tackle during the Commanders’ 24-17 win over Philadelphia.

Luvu had a down year after earning All-Pro honors last season. The eighth-year vet finished third on the team with 86 tackles (five for loss), adding three sacks and two forced fumbles.

• Jalen Thompson (WSU), a veteran starter at safety for Arizona, tallied a team-high 10 tackles during the Cardinals’ 37-20 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.

Thompson, a seventh-year pro, totaled 95 tackles this season – third on the team – along with six PBUs, one sack and one forced fumble. He started 15 games, missing two with an injury.

• Samson Ebukam (EWU), a defensive end for Indianapolis, matched a season high with five tackles during the Colts’ 38-30 loss to Houston.

The ninth-year vet finished the season with 33 tackles (five for loss) and two sacks in 14 games (one start). Coming off an Achilles injury that sidelined him for the entire 2024 season, Ebukam couldn’t return to his productive form of 2023, when he started every game and recorded 9.5 sacks for the Colts.

• Ryan Rehkow (Central Valley) averaged 44.4 yards on five punts for Cincinnati during its 20-18 loss to Cleveland, placing four inside the Browns’ 20-yard line.

The BYU grad entered the final week of the regular season ranked second in the NFL in punting average (51 yards per punt).

• Hogan Hatten (Idaho), the long snapper for Detroit, made his second tackle of the season during the Lions’ 19-16 win over Chicago.

Hatten held down long-snapping duties for Detroit in every game over the past two seasons.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/wFc5rSAPM2Yg8gLuU1yYAUoa5qM=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2026/01/04/695b31dde329c.hires.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 02:22:11.766887

Ham rushed for a short touchdown, and the Minnesota Vikings finished a frustrating season by beating the resting Green Bay Packers 16-3 on Sunday.

The Packers (9-7-1) were locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs for the third straight year with nothing to play for. They sidelined almost all of their starters with season-ending injuries to several key players including star pass rusher Micah Parsons still top of mind, unconcerned by a four-game losing streak that they will take into the playoffs.

“We tried to protect as many as we could. But also, I thought it was just a great opportunity for a lot of these guys that haven’t gotten the reps that maybe they want,” coach Matt LaFleur said.

McCarthy didn't get nearly the amount of playing time this season that he or the Vikings wanted, either. He missed seven games and parts of two others with multiple injuries, after knee surgery wiped out his rookie year.

McCarthy, who went 14 for 23 for 182 yards, left early in the third quarter with soreness in his throwing hand. Backup Max Brosmer took it from there, helping Justin Jefferson reach the 100-yard mark for the first time in 12 games as the Vikings (9-8) coasted to a fifth consecutive victory.

The Vikings were eliminated three weeks ago.

“The fact that our team was able to aim and focus through a time when quite honestly some other teams wouldn’t says a lot about our players,” coach Kevin O'Connell said.

Jefferson secured his sixth straight 1,000-yard season, only the third receiver in NFL history to accomplish that feat.

With Jordan Love safely watching on the sideline and Malik Willis recovering from injuries, the Packers gave Clayton Tune his second career start at quarterback and netted minus-7 passing yards. Dallas Turner had two of Minnesota's four sacks that racked up 41 lost yards for Green Bay.

Tune went 6 for 11 for 34 yards with LaFleur sending Daniel Whelan out to punt on Green Bay's first eight possessions, excluding a kneel-down to end the first half. LaFleur called timeout with 1 second left from the 5-yard line so Brandon McManus could spoil the shutout with a short field goal.

“Just move past this one and get our minds ready for the playoffs,” Tune said.

Farewell moment?

Ham, the two-time Pro Bowl pick who has played all 10 seasons in the NFL for his home-state team, received several ovations from the crowd with the possibility this was his final game. He will be a free agent in two months.

“There’s not too many people in this league like him,” Jefferson said, “and have the love and the hard-work attitude as C.J.”

Another potential farewell was for 14th-year safety Harrison Smith, who was feted multiple times throughout the afternoon. He's under contract for 2026 and has not decided whether he'll return.

“I was kind of joking before the game, ‘I feel like I’m at my funeral. I don’t really have a choice anymore with what’s going on here,’” Smith said. “So we’ll see.”

Injury report

Packers: WR Bo Melton (knee) limped off after covering a punt in the second quarter, forcing Jayden Reed into some action. The Packers kept their other two starting WRs — Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs — on the sideline, cognizant of Watson's torn ACL in the final regular season game last year. ... One of the few starters who saw on action on defense, nickel back Javon Bullard, limped off in the fourth quarter with a knee injury. LaFleur said he believes Bullard will be OK.

Vikings: TE Josh Oliver hurt his ankle in the second quarter after moving the chains with a 7-yard reception and did not return. ... RB Aaron Jones (hip) and TE T.J. Hockenson (shoulder) were inactive, among five starters missing from the original lineup at the beginning of the season.

Up next

The Packers play in the wild-card round next weekend at the No. 2 seed, either Chicago or Philadelphia.

The Vikings must clear space under the salary cap and improve their depth at quarterback, on the offensive line and at cornerback. They'll have either the 17th or 18th pick in the first round.

That wait ended Sunday. The New England Patriots defeated the Miami Dolphins by a score of 38-10 to close out the regular season with a 14-3 record.

Here’s a glance back on the finale as head coach Mike Vrabel’s side sets playoff sights on the Los Angeles Chargers.

Against Miami, Maye rests MVP case

The first win of the campaign arrived against the Dolphins. The last win would, too. Drake Maye remained at the center of why.

The Patriots quarterback completed 14-of-18 passes for 191 yards with one touchdown on Sunday. He added 41 rushing yards through a handful of carries before becoming a spectator.

Taking the field in jumbo “12” personnel, the opening drive spanned three handoffs and 70 yards on the way to a 7-0 lead. A 92-yard surge followed next time out for offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels’ contingent, ranging from a flea-flicker to a pre-snap motion out wide. But the scoreboard didn’t stay at 14-0. A three-and-out was met by a turnover on downs instead. By halftime in Foxborough, New England stood with a 17-10 lead and a single conversion on third down, courtesy of a scramble by the 23-year-old NFL MVP candidate.

Coming out of the break, Maye went a perfect 7-of-7 for 107 yards and his 31st touchdown through the air. Backup quarterback Joshua Dobbs took things home with 11:01 left on the game clock as the division champions reached the 14 wins for the first time since 2016.

The game’s top target would be tight end and captain Hunter Henry, who caught five passes for 56 yards and a $250,000 incentive with his 60th grab of the season.

Diggs eclipses 1,000 receiving yards

A wide receiver room that lost Mack Hollins to injured reserve with an abdomen injury last week had plenty to gain.

Stefon Diggs led the way for New England’s depth chart in wake of facing charges of strangulation and battery. The past All-Pro caught three passes for 43 yards against Miami. A 34-yarder in the final quarter got him over the 1,000-yard mark for the seventh time dating back to 2018. No receiver had gotten there for the organization since Patriots Hall of Fame inductee Julian Edelman’s 2019 campaign.

Efton Chism III, fresh off his initial trip to the end zone, made his initial start out wide alongside the veteran. The undrafted rookie out of Eastern Washington turned trickery into a 35-yard reception early on.

No. 66 back on the blindside

The Patriots went four games without Will Campbell due to an MCL sprain. But the rookie left tackle found himself activated from injured reserve on the eve of the 4:25 p.m. ET kickoff. He found himself back in the lineup from there.

Next to the No. 4 overall pick out of LSU, the starting offensive line included Ben Brown at left guard, Garrett Bradbury at center, Mike Onwenu at right guard, Morgan Moses at right tackle and Thayer Munford Jr. as the eligible sixth man.

A road-grading group. No sacks followed for the Dolphins, while rookie interior lineman Jared Wilson spent a second week in the NFL’s concussion protocol.

Five touchdowns for the backfield

Miami entered the season finale having allowed north of 2,000 rushing yards to opponents. That would be music to the ears of New England’s tandem.

Scoring three touchdowns for the first time in his NFL tenure, Rhamondre Stevenson turned seven carries into 131 yards and two catches in 22 yards on Sunday.

The starting running back broke off a season-long run of 65 yards on the opening drive with his 6-foot, 227-pound blend of patience and punish. And after plunging in for a touchdown in Wildcat fashion, he notched his second on a sluggo route. A hat-trick followed on the ground from 35 yards away.

TreVeyon Henderson visited the end zone, too, for touchdown No. 9 and No. 10 of his inaugural campaign. The former NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month rushed for 53 yards over the course of 13 attempts. Veteran D’Ernest Johnson rounded out the backfield and operated as the kickoff returner.

Turnovers help turn the tide

A third start was on deck for Quinn Ewers. After a bootleg keeper for nine yards, the Dolphins quarterback went 16-of-23 passing for 137 yards. He tossed one touchdown and one interception.

The secondary hosting the No. 231 overall pick did not have to cover the likes of wide receiver Jaylen Waddle or tight end Darren Waller. Yet after a drop ended the first series with a turnover on downs, Miami returned to the red zone with ease on the second series. And wideout Malik Washington made the most of being unaccounted for on play-faking TD catch with rookie safety Craig Woodson the closest man in coverage.

A defense heading into January football didn’t resemble one early on. Turnovers helped turn the tide.

Linebacker Jack Gibbens and Pro Bowl cornerback Christian Gonzalez forced a fumble on sophomore running back Jaylen Wright in the second quarter. And in the third quarter, veteran safety Jaylinn Hawkins picked off the rookie quarterback in the end zone to get to a team-leading four on the season.

Four sacks on Ewers

Standout running back De’Von Achane closed out the season among Miami’s inactives. New England, on the other hand, finished with a Super Bowl LIX champion officially back from injured reserve.

Milton Williams started on Sunday. Unblocked, he soon broke six yards into the backfield on a tackle for loss. The streaky defense took the field in the base 3-4. That starting front line also included Cory Durden and Christian Barmore, who recorded a sack days after charges of domestic assault and battery stemming from an alleged August incident surfaced.

The Patriots remained without nose tackle Khyiris Tonga as well as captains Harold Landry III and Robert Spillane. But there was another captain on the backend. A third-and-10 nickel blitz from captain Marcus Jones sent the punt unit on in a 24-10 game. Undrafted edge defender Elijah Ponder got the third sack of the outing after previously gloving a fumble recovery.

And on a one-year deal, K’Lavon Chaisson got the last. The veteran outside linebacker extended his career best to 7.5 sacks and hit a $500,000 incentive in the process.

Borregales goes from rejection to 59

With 1:42 to go before halftime, the opportunity to take a 17-7 lead went awry for Patriots special teams coordinator Jeremy Springer’s group. Dolphins defensive tackle Zach Sieler sliced through the gap occupied by offensive linemen Vederian Lowe and Brenden Jaimes to deliver a 38-yard rejection.

It marked the first blocked field goal of the season for New England. Only there would be a quick response.

Rookie kicker Andy Borregales split the uprights from 59 yards away for a new career long as things reached intermission at 17-10. That now holds a spot in the franchise archives behind only Stephen Gostkowski’s 62-yarder from 2017 and Joey Slye’s 63-yarder from 2024. The former Miami Hurricane finished Sunday 1-of-2 on field goals and 5-of-5 on extra points.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2254668849.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.66001556069118%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2026-01-04 21:12:56.887312

JACKSONVILLE ― If you thought this Tennessee Titans season was bad withCam Ward, just imagine how bad it would've been without him.

The Titans' 2025 season wheezed to a conclusion with a 41-7 loss against the Jacksonville Jaguars at EverBank Stadium, saddling the Titans with their second consecutive 3-14 record and their first winless season within their division since moving to Tennessee.

Rookie quarterback Cam Ward led a five-play, 58-yard scoring drive to give the Titans a 7-0 lead in the first quarter, capped by a 7-yard Ward rushing touchdown, but Ward injured his throwing shoulder on the play and was ruled out for the remainder of the game, thrusting backup quarterback Brandon Allen into action.

Allen, playing for the first time in a Titans uniform, struggled. He went 17-for-30 with 72 yards and an interception that was returned 58 yards for a touchdown by safety Antonio Johnson. That possession was the lone time Allen led the Titans across midfield.

By contrast, Jacksonville quarterback Trevor Lawrence played one of his best games, clinching an AFC South title for the upstart Jaguars (13-4). Lawrence completed 22 of his 30 pass attempts for 255 yards and three touchdowns, albeit against an injury-addled Titans defense that didn't feature any of its Week 1 starters in the secondary.

Now the Titans' attentions can turn to the 2026 NFL Draft, in which the Titans are guaranteed a top-five pick, and the impending coaching search as led by general manager Mike Borgonzi.

Cam Ward injury: What happened, and what does it mean?

The Titans called two designed runs for Ward on the opening drive. Designed quarterback runs had been something of a rarity throughout Ward's rookie season; he'd averaged fewer than one per game. But the Titans leaned on it early, and to some success. Ward carried for four yards on a second down, and then for seven yards on his first-and-goal touchdown, following blockers toward the home-sideline pylon and stretching out to give the Titans an early lead.

The play came with its consequences. Ward landed awkwardly on his shoulder, leading to evaluation on the sideline and then later in the locker room. Within half an hour of his injury, he'd already been ruled out for the remainder of the game.

He returned to the sideline, wearing a sling to support his right arm.

Ward was 3-for-3 with 52 yards passing to go along with his two rushes on the opening drive. Included among his 52 yards was a 39-yard completion to rookie Elic Ayomanor, converting a third-and-10. It took Allen 27 attempts to reach the passing yardage mark Ward achieved on his first and only series.

Trevor Lawrence stats: The other QB who didn't finish the game

Lawrence exited the game early in the fourth quarter, shortly after crossing the 4,000-yard mark for the season. He also broke the Jaguars' single-season record for touchdown passes with 38, surpassing the mark set by Blake Bortles in 2015.

When Lawrence exited and was replaced by backup Nick Mullens, Jaguars fans at EverBank Stadium showered Lawrence with ""MVP!"" chants.

What's next for Tennessee Titans: Coaching search timeline

Interim coach Mike McCoy completes his tenure with a 2-9 record. It's difficult to imagine McCoy remaining as a serious candidate for the Titans' coaching vacancy, which has been open since October following the dismissal of Brian Callahan.

Borgonzi will lead the search for Callahan's full-time replacement. Beginning in the days following the end of the season, the Titans may begin requesting permissions for and conducting virtual interviews with candidates employed by other NFL teams. The Titans cannot conduct in-person interviews for the position until after the divisional round of the playoffs concludes.

The Titans and Giants are the only teams that entered Week 18 with coaching vacancies, but it is anticipated. that multiple others will open up in the following days, creating more competition for the top candidates.","https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/04/PNAS/88019288007-usatsi-27930763.jpg?crop=4342,2443,x0,y226&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-04 20:00:35.989477

Shortly after Prater was sidelined, the Bills scored on a 2-yard touchdown pass from Mitchell Trubisky to Gabe Davis. With no kicker available, Buffalo went for a 2-point conversion, which Trubisky completed to Keon Coleman for a 29-0 lead.

Mitch Wishnowsky handled kickoff duties in the second half.

""It happened in the second quarter so we started putting a plan in place and then we got in at halftime and were told he can't go at all,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. ""We'll have to see what it looks like tomorrow. I'm sure they'll get some films of it and we'll know a little bit more, but, yeah, unfortunate.""

Sunday marked Prater’s return after missing two games with the quadriceps injury he suffered in Week 15. The 41-year-old did not practice leading up to Weeks 16 or 17 but was a full participant in practice during Week 18.

The Bills signed veteran Michael Badgley during Prater’s absence, but released him Monday following a missed extra point in each of his two games. Badgley's only extra point attempt was blocked by Jalen Cater in Week 17 changed the trajectory in Buffalo's 13-12 loss to the Eagles.

Wil Lutz nailed four field goals and Ja'Quan McMillian had a pick-six to give Denver the dominant win.

The Broncos improved to 14-3 on the season and edged out the Patriots (14-3) for the top seed. They will have a bye for next week's wild-card round.

It's the first time Denver has had the No. 1 seed since the 2015-16 season when they won Super Bowl 50.

No touchdown (5:32 p.m.): Incredible effort by Tre' Harris to drag his feet for the catch in the corner of the end zone. He just couldn't get control of the ball.

Turnover? (5:27 p.m.): The call is a forced fumble and a recovery by the Broncos. The play is under review. It's an incomplete pass. — Nguyen

Big gain (5:07 p.m.): Jaleel McLaughlin with the 17-yard catch-and-run. With RJ Harvey struggling, Denver should lean on the smaller back. — Nguyen

Nearly sacked (5:05 p.m.): That was almost a sack by Pat Surtain II. Trey Lance scrambles out for a 10-yard gain. Now fourth-and-7 and they're going for it. And Pat Surtain II just straight up blew up that subsequent play. Denver ball. — Nguyen

Sacked (5:03 p.m.): After Trey Lance scrambled for a 22-yard gain, Denver's defense responds with a split sack for an 8-yard loss. Eyioma Uwazurike and Sai'vion Jones are credited with the takedown. — Nguyen

Rockies shot (4:59 p.m.): As Troy Renck told me, ""If you wanted to see bad offense, you could just go to a Rockies road game."" -- Saunders

Field goal, Broncos (4:55 p.m.): Denver squanders another chance. Wil Lutz nails the 41-yard field goal to cap the four play, minus-2-yard drive. Broncos 16, Chargers 3 with 11:45 to go in the fourth. — Nguyen

Broncos defense hands ball to offense at 20. They lose 2 yards, and Wil Lutz drills 41-yard FG. Payton wanted a loud crowd today. Not sure their voracious booing is what he had in mind. -- Renck

Strip sacked (4:51 p.m.): Nik Bonitto wasn't going to mess up twice. He strip sacks Trey Lance and Denver recovers the ball. — Nguyen

You want takeaways? They have got your takeaways. Broncos no longer have the fewest in franchise history. They have 14 now, one better than 2008 team. Nik Bonitto gets the strip sack. He looked like Von Miller coming around the corner with the chop. Broncos take over at 20-yard line. -- Renck

First down (4:46 p.m.): Bo Nix finds Marvin Mims Jr. for the 8-yard catch-and-run for the first down. — Nguyen

Third-quarter thoughts — Broncos 13, Chargers 3

Parker Gabriel, Broncos reporter: Denver is 15 minutes from the No. 1 seed. That's an achievement worth celebrating. Today's offensive performance, on the other hand, is not.

Sean Keeler, sports columnist: This game has been so dumb, so preseason-ish bland, the only thing missing so far has been a Stiddy series. Make it happen, Sean. Make it happen.

Troy Renck, sports columnist: The Broncos offense looks out of sync, out of rhythm, out of answers. Broncos should win this game. But there is little to build off. Yes, the game plan was a little vanilla. That doesn't excuse this performance.

Third-quarter updates

Strnad's day (4:45 p.m.): Not just this week, but Justin Strnad's turned himself into a really solid player.

Obviously a lot (Denver hopes) between now and the offseason, but interesting decisions ahead with he and Alex Singleton free agents and Dre Greenlaw's contract fairly easy to get out of. — Gabriel

Chargers punting (4:41 p.m.): Six plays for 12 yards. Denver's getting the ball back. — Nguyen

Three-and-out (4:36 p.m.): Getting sacked on first down didn't help. Denver's going to punt. — Nguyen

Said forever wanted Bo Nix to run. And he has a season-high 50 yards on ground. But did not want it to be at expense of pass game. Nix is having his worst day of the season. He is 9-17 for 89 yards. Broncos punting again. -- Renck

Mimsy! (4:33 p.m.): Marvin Mims Jr. runs the punt back for 33 yards to the Denver 45. — Nguyen

Sacked (4:32 p.m.): Justin Strnad sacks Trey Lance for an 8-yard loss on third-and-8. Chargers punting. — Nguyen

Hell of a sack by Broncos LB Justin Strnad. Circled all the way around the line to get Lance. -- Saunders

Challenge failed (4:31 p.m.): Denver challenged that the pass to Keenan Allen was no good. The review said it was. — Nguyen

Rough day for Denver sports (4:28 p.m.): Gabe Landeskog is down in Florida. The Nuggets gave up 127 points to Michael Porter Jr's Nets. The Broncos are sleepwalking to a 13-3 lead over the Chargers' backups, and that's somehow looking like the Mile High high point of the day so far. Woof. -- Keeler

Missed sack (4:26 p.m.): How the heck did Nik Bonitto miss that sack? He had Trey Lance dead to rights and couldn't bring him down. — Nguyen

Overthrows (4:21 p.m.): Not great passes by Bo Nix on those last two plays. Wil Lutz nails the 26-yard field goal to make it 13-3 Broncos with 10:07 to go in the third quarter. — Nguyen

Bo Nix is way off right now. Throw to Evan Engram on that 37-yarder was way behind. Sailed one over Troy Franklin, just airmailed a screen to RJ Harvey.

Broncos have to settle for -- another -- FG.

13-3. — Evans

The Broncos' offense is running like a used Yugo today. But Bronx lead Chargers, 13-3, with 10:07 left in the third quarter. -- Saunders

Huge gain (4:19 p.m.): Nix finds a wide-open Evan Engram for a 37-yard gain. — Nguyen

Offense finally percolating. Nix with good run, and he connects with Evan Engram on a 37-yard gain. Nix had 38 yards passing before that play. -- Renck

Running game (4:17 p.m.): A 7-yard scramble by Bo Nix on the first play of the drive. Jaleel McLaughlin follows it up with an 8-yard run. They should give him the ball more. — Nguyen

Three-and-out (4:16 p.m.): Denver's defense provides heavy pressure on that drive. Denver 's getting the ball back at its own 40. — Nguyen

Three-and-out (4:09 p.m.): Three plays, 6 yards. Jeremy Crawshaw punts. Not a good start for Denver. — Nguyen

Injury update (4:07 p.m.): Cheers from the crowd as Garett Bolles re-enters the game. — Nguyen

Halftime thoughts — Broncos 10, Chargers 3

Parker Gabriel, beat reporter: The injuries to Garett Bolles and P.J. Locke might be the most impactful storyline going so far for Denver. The lackluster play shouldn't — shouldn't —really matter against Trey Lance in the second half.

Sean Keeler, sports columnist: If you're a Broncos fan, those last 15 minutes were Dante's new sixth circle of Hell, nestled between Wrath and Heresy. If this were a high school game, both head coaches might agree at halftime to pull their guys, get on their respective buses, and go home. Alas, Tony Romo is in the house, so we have to play on. At least we've got the Nuggets! Right? Right? Oh. Never mind.

Troy Renck, sports columnist: This has been exactly what Broncos did not need, despite the lead. Offense lacks creativity and balance. Running backs went silent after first quarter. 12 carries for 45 yards is just OK. Nix has been their best runner. And the fact that Trey Lance has more passing yards (80-38) than Nix doesn't inspire confidence. Throw in injuries to Bolles and Locke, and well not good.

Patrick Saunders, reporter: You've got to wonder if the Broncos are serving a vanilla offense on purpose today. 118 yards in the first half.

Second-quarter updates

Field goal, Chargers (3:50 p.m.): Cameron Dicker nails a 30-yard field goal to cap a 12-play, 51-yard drive for Los Angeles. Broncos 10, Chargers 3 with three seconds left in the half. — Nguyen

Nearly picked (3:46 p.m.): Riley Moss read that pass all the way. Just couldn't snag it. It would've been another pick-six. — Nguyen

Overturned (3:39 p.m.): No first down for the Chargers. The challenge showed that Denver stopped them a yard short. Fourth down. — Nguyen

Quiet (3:37 p.m.): Both Chargers and Broncos offenses are taking a siesta. Nice afternoon for it. Still 64 degrees. -- Saunders

Injury update (3:34 p.m.): Bolles out of the tent and headed to the locker room. Serious question: At one point do you consider pulling your starters, if you're Payton? 14-point lead?

Locke (leg) questionable. Bolles (ankle) questionable. Mercy. -- Keeler

Rough day so far (3:31 p.m.): RJ Harvey hasn't gotten much going early. Nine carries for just 22 yards. — Nguyen

Bo Nix's fancy feet (3:29 p.m.): Nix goes for 11 yards on the scramble. Would've been much more if he stayed in bounds. — Nguyen

Bolles injury (3:26 p.m.): Garett Bolles is down. Garett Bolles is NEVER down. Geez.

Bolles needs help to leave the field, but got handshakes and salutes from LAC defenders as he's coming off. This game, man. This. game. -- Keeler

Garett Bolles injured on run play. He is pain. Appears to be pointing toward left leg. This is last thing Broncos need going into the playoffs. Frank Crum in at left tackle. Bolles is walking off slowly with help of medical staff. -- Renck

Locke injury (3:21 p.m.): P.J. Locke is currently in the medical tent. Devon Key finished that drive at safety next to Talanoa Hufanga. — Gabriel

Sacked (3:20 p.m.): Nik Bonitto and Zach Allen take down Trey Lance for the Broncos' first sack of the day. — Nguyen

Zach Allen and Nik Bonitto split a sack. Before that play, PJ Locke was injured. Appeared to be limping as went to blue tent. -- Renck

Rough drive (3:13 p.m.): RJ Harvey's having a rough drive. Two carries that went nowhere and now a drop that would've gotten some yards. — Nguyen

Best part of the Broncos' offense thus far has been Bo Nix running on broken plays. -- Saunders

Back in (3:12 p.m.): Forsyth is back in game now after the first down. -- Renck

Injury update (3:11 p.m.): Alex Forsyth went through some drills and appears to have had right ankle re-taped. He should return in this game. Perhaps on the next series. -- Renck

No good (3:09 p.m.): Trey Lance tried to sneak up the gut on third-and-1 and was stopped by Malcolm Roach. Colorado's own J.K. Scott is coming out for the punt. — Nguyen

First-quarter thoughts — Broncos 10, Chargers 0

Parker Gabriel, beat reporter: The key is winning this game. Much of what's happening in this game, though — stalling out in the red zone, testing the depth on the interior OL — is not what you want to be doing once the playoffs do actually begin.

Luca Evans, Broncos writer: This one isn't in doubt. But the most important development of the day: Broncos center Alex Forsyth is in the blue tent with an ankle injury and questionable to return. Sam Mustipher, signed last week for center depth, is in. Bad sight for Broncos with Luke Wattenberg already on IR.

Sean Keeler, sports columnist: Trey Lance's general aim means the Broncos probably aren't in danger. But being forced to swap Sam Mustipher in for Alex Forsyth at center mid-game could be less than ideal. Like Chargers DL Teair Tart's motor but the dude got away with one with that Nix nudge on the sideline.

Troy Renck, sports columnist: Trey Lance is not good. So the Chargers don't represent a threat in thie game. But the first objective today, beyond winning, was getting takeaways. They produced a pick six. Also, need Nix to use his legs. And he's done that. So comfortable first that will build confidence.

First-quarter updates

Injury (3:02 p.m.): Not great for Denver. Alex Forsyth, who's replacing starting center Luke Wattenberg in the lineup, was grabbing his ankle after that last play. — Nguyen

Chargers offense (2:58 p.m.): Chargers are averaging 2.3 yards per play in the first quarter -- a combination of the Broncos' defense and Trey Lance's futility. — Saunders

Short game? (2:56 p.m.): It might be curtains on the Trey Lance Showcase already. — Evans

High decibel (2:55 p.m.): Sean Payton wanted LOUD at Empower Field. He got it. Imagine what it will be like in the playoffs. -- Saunders

Familiar face (2:54 p.m.): For weeks, the idea of J.K. Dobbins has floated around Empower Field, whispers around his return intensifying with each passing week despite no actual sign of the man himself.

On Sunday, though, Dobbins was in sweats and in the flesh on a sunny day in Denver, adding to growing optimism that the Broncos might indeed get their No. 1 RB back depending on how long the Broncos’ playoff run can last. Read more. — Evans

Touchdown, Broncos (2:48 p.m.): Ja'Quan McMillian intercepts Trey Lance after the ball was deflected off of KeAndre Lambert-Smith's hands for a 45-yard pick-six. Broncos 10, Chargers 0 with 3:39 to go in the first quarter. — Nguyen

You want takeaways? I got your takeaways? #Broncos Ja'Quan McMillian gets pick six. So Broncos now have 13 takeways, tied for fewest in franchise history. And that won't be last one today. And it is the first defensive score this season. -- Renck

Field goal, Broncos (2:42 p.m.): The Chargers stopped Denver on third-and-goal. Wil Lutz nails the 24-yard field goal. Fifteen plays for 81 yards on a drive that took 8:52. Broncos 3, Chargers 0 with 5:06 to go in the first quarter. — Nguyen

Annnnnnd .... it took 14 plays for Sean to cheat on his ""pass-lite"" diet. Ah, well. 3-0, Broncos. -- Keeler

Tyler Badie is to screen passes for Broncos what Andre Iguodala was to 3-pointers for Nuggets. -- Renck

Probably (right?) won't matter today, but those are the kind of drives that you absolutely have to find a way to finish in the end zone when the playoffs begin. — Gabriel

Tyler Badie has been excellent in third-down pass-pro this season, but has rarely been a difference-making in passing game in making guys miss. Lost 3 on third-down checkdown there (play wasn't going anywhere anyway). — Evans

Crazy math: 15 plays, 81 yards, 8:52 off the clock, equals three points for Broncos. — Saunders

Splits (2:39 p.m.): Ten runs and three passes so far. Is Sean Payton finally keeping some New Year's resolution? -- Keeler

Make that 10 carries for 73 yards. Denver entered Week 18 averaging about 119 a game this year. — Nguyen

More running! (2:37 p.m.): RJ Harvey with an 11-yard gain. That's 62 yards on the ground for Denver on this drive. — Nguyen

Heavy on the runs (2:35 p.m.): Nix goes for 22 and then McLaughlin gets a 7-yard gain. — Nguyen

Have said this until I am hoarse. Want the run game to improve: Let Bo Go. He has 28 yards rushing on two carries, including a 22-yarder. Goal should be for him to be around 50 a game moving forward. — Renck

Bryant returns (2:33 p.m.): Bo Nix targets Pat Bryant for the first passing play of the day for the Broncos. It goes incomplete. Nix goes to him again on the subsequent play for the first down. Good see Bryant healthy after that brutal hit. — Nguyen

Run, Denver, run (2:33 p.m.): Four plays, four runs for Denver to open its drive. — Nguyen

Running game (2:30 p.m.): Jaleel McLaughlin gets the start at RB. Goes for 6 yards on his first carry. Interesting. -- Renck

Classic (2:29 p.m.): As uniform games go, hard to get better than this. Chargers have one of the best uniforms in football. And Broncos' orange is iconic. Will say Quebec Nordiques v. Hartford Whalers last night was equally cool. -- Renck

Opponents (2:28 p.m.): Two fresh Broncos opponents for 2026 after the early action:

at Carolina (NFC South champ)

vs. Jacksonville (AFC South champ)

They'll also visit the winner of tonight's Pittsburgh/Baltimore division title game. — Gabriel

Coin toss (2:25 p.m.): Broncos win the toss and elect to kick. — Nguyen

Pre-game updates

Inactives (1:04 p.m.): Broncos DL John Franklin-Myers is indeed inactive.

The rest of Denver's list:

ILB Dre Greenlaw (hamstring)

OL Geron Christian

TE Marcedes Lewis

OLB Que Robinson

CB Reese Taylor

Marcedes Lewis being inactive means he'll finish the regular season without a catch. He just needed one to join Jerry Rice as the only players with a catch in 20 or more seasons. — Gabriel

Good morning from Empower Field (11:30 a.m.): Denver might officially be the San Diego of the AFC West. It's 60 and sunny ... again. Maybe later this month we'll get a bad weather playoff game. This afternoon, of course, will dictate when that playoff game arrives. With a win, Denver will play two weeks from now. Lose and they'll be right back here Saturday, Sunday or Monday. — Gabriel

Scouting report (9:16 a.m.): Check out how the Broncos match up with the Chargers in Luca Evans' scouting report.

Game predictions

Parker Gabriel, Broncos writer: Broncos 38, Chargers 0

If it was good enough for Week 18 last year, it’s good enough for Week 18 this year. The Broncos need a win to wrap up the No. 1 seed. The Chargers are sitting likely several key players. A couple of times this year, Sean Payton’s played just to ensure a win. This week, the bet here is he tries to dial up a feel-good game for Bo Nix and the Broncos offense heading into a bye week. What does it matter once Denver’s postseason play actually starts? Probably not much.

Luca Evans, Broncos writer: Broncos 21, Chargers 13

This will be another one-score game, because of course it will. Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter is too good to let Sean Payton and Bo Nix just tee off on Sunday, and here’s betting Los Angeles takes a similar approach to Kansas City and tries to keep the lid on the Broncos’ passing game. The Chargers just have little offensive juice without Herbert, though, and this one should really never be in doubt.

Troy Renck, columnist: Broncos 34, Chargers 12

Sean Payton knows his team needs momentum going into the playoffs as it clinches the AFC’s top seed. He will not be a turtle on offense. More like a snap dragon. Remember what the Broncos did to the JV Chiefs in the season finale a year ago? This should be a repeat, including two takeaways by the suddenly-maligned defense.

Sean Keeler, columnist: Broncos 23, Chargers 10

The Chargers’ offensive line is a mess, and Vance Joseph’s defense won’t miss. Los Angeles gave up five sacks to the Texans, four to the Chiefs and seven to the Eagles — that’s 16 takedowns over the last four games. The Bolts come into the weekend 28th in the league in sack percentage allowed, per SumerSports.com. The road to Super Bowl LX goes through Empower Field.

Broncos-Chargers NFL Week 18: Must-reads

Renck: Doubts remain about Broncos offense. Time for Sean Payton’s vindication.

On a forgettable Thursday night, the Broncos became Raiders of the Lost Art. They won, beating Las Vegas, despite finishing with more penalties (11) than first downs (10). There is winning ugly, and there is delivering a victory while looking like Freddy Krueger.

In the six games since, the Broncos have averaged 24.5 points per game. As the excitement bubbles about the postseason, it is important to remember how vulnerable the Broncos are. They have trailed in 12 of their wins. Their negative turnover margin cannot be ignored.

But there is a takeaway as important as the takeaways: it is time for Sean Payton to shine. Read Troy Renck's column.

Broncos analysis: Sean Payton’s takeaway quest and an existential defensive question

A defense as disruptive as the Broncos figured to be and one that takes the ball away, too? That set up a scary proposition. Except then a strange thing happened. The turnovers dried up. The group has smacked around quarterbacks, tackled well and dominated most key areas but hasn’t taken the ball away like an elite defense.

Now the playoffs are just about here and head coach Sean Payton is doing his version of sounding an alarm bell. Read Parker Gabriel's story.

Broncos CB Jahdae Barron says it’s ‘human nature’ to want more reps, but rookie’s role is growing

That has been the story of Barron’s inaugural season in Denver: a rookie who’s gradually learned to put himself in better positions in Joseph’s defense but has only sparingly found himself in the position to do so.

Six months ago, in a locker room in Santa Clara, Calif., after the Broncos’ first preseason game of the season, Barron told The Post that “everything’s gonna click.” Now, as the Broncos gear up for a postseason run that could take them right back to Santa Clara for the Super Bowl, Barron’s role has mostly stayed static.

--- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) J.J. McCarthy had a productive first half before he was injured again, fullback C.J. Ham rushed for a short touchdown, and the Minnesota Vikings finished a frustrating season by beating the resting Green Bay Packers 16-3 on Sunday.

Green Bay (9-7-1) was locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs and had nothing to play for.

McCarthy, who went 14 for 23 for 182 yards passing, pulled himself out after his first throw of the third quarter so the athletic training staff could examine his right hand and did not return. Backup Max Brosmer took it from there, helping Justin Jefferson reach the 100-yard mark for the first time in 12 games as the Vikings (9-8) coasted to their fifth consecutive victory.

Jefferson had already secured his sixth straight 1,000-yard season, only the third receiver in NFL history to accomplish that feat.

With Jordan Love safely watching on the sideline and Malik Willis recovering from injuries, the Packers gave Clayton Tune his second career start at quarterback and netted minus-7 passing yards. Dallas Turner had two of Minnesota's four sacks that racked up 41 lost yards for Green Bay.

Tune went 6 for 11 for 34 yards with Packers coach Matt LaFleur holding out almost every available starter and sending Daniel Whelan out to punt on Green Gay's first eight possessions, excluding a kneel-down to end the first half. LaFleur called timeout with 1 second left from the 5-yard line so Brandon McManus could spoil the shutout with a short field goal.

Ham, the two-time Pro Bowl pick who has played all 10 seasons in the NFL for his home-state team, received several ovations from the crowd with the possibility this was his final game. Another potential farewell was for 14th-year safety Harrison Smith, who was feted multiple times throughout the afternoon.

Packers: WR Bo Melton (knee) limped off after covering a punt in the second quarter, forcing Jayden Reed into some action in three-receiver sets with Dontayvion Wicks (concussion) inactive and Savion Williams (foot) on injured reserve. The Packers otherwise preferred to keep their three starting WRs - Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs and Reed - on the sideline with every other key player. ... One of the few starters who saw on action on defense, nickel back Javon Bullard, limped off in the fourth quarter with a knee injury.

Vikings: TE Josh Oliver hurt his ankle in the second quarter after moving the chains with a 7-yard reception and did not return. ... RB Aaron Jones (hip) and TE T.J. Hockenson (shoulder) were inactive, among five starters missing from the original lineup at the beginning of the season.

The Packers play in the wild-card round next weekend at the No. 2 seed, either Chicago or Philadelphia.

The Vikings will have a busy offseason, needing to clear plenty of space under the salary cap and improve their depth at quarterback, on the offensive line and at cornerback. They'll pick in the first round somewhere between 16th and 18th.

However, with Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh opting to sit their starters for the season finale, including quarterback Justin Herbert, the Broncos’ path to No. 1 became much clearer. Denver can also claim the top seed with a loss, but would need New England and Jacksonville to lose as well.

New England needs to beat Miami, then have the Broncos lose to the Chargers to claim the No. 1 seed. Now, should both Denver and New England lose on Sunday, Jacksonville's victory over Tennessee would give the Jaguars the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs.

With his first sack on Burrow, Garrett recorded his 23rd sack of the 2025 season in Week 18 and broke the NFL single-season sack record.
He also broke the Browns single-season sack record that he set in 2021 and tied in 2022.
Going back to the offseason, Cesaire saw Garrett take his preparation to another level, with a more focused and purpose-driven offseason.
Cesaire has believed all along Garrett would break the sack record.","DE Myles Garrett has officially done what no player has since the 2001 season when the NFL single-season sack record was set – break it.

With about five minutes left in the fourth quarter against the Bengals, Garrett broke past OL Orlando Brown Jr. and wrapped his arms around QB Joe Burrow to bring him down for the sack.

With his first sack on Burrow, Garrett recorded his 23rd sack of the 2025 season in Week 18 and broke the NFL single-season sack record. He surpassed Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt, with Strahan originally setting the record at 22.5 sacks during the 2001 season and Watt tying the record in 2021.

""Every game I'm in awe of him of what he can do and how special he is, but this year it's definitely been special,"" defensive line coach Jacques Cesaire said.

Garrett believed throughout the season he was capable of breaking the record. Each week he fought through chip blocks, double teams and triple teams from opposing offenses in their efforts to slow him down.

Yet, Garrett still found a way.

""I don't even think about it as a want – I just think about something that I'm going to knock down,"" Garrett said on Nov. 28. ""It's already been written in my mind that it's going just how far I'm going to take it. So, just going to go out there and do what I do, and whatever number I end up at.""

Garrett capped off this season with a historic milestone and added to the other accolades he earned along the way. He also broke the Browns single-season sack record that he set in 2021 and tied in 2022. He became the first player since 1982 to record 12 sacks in six consecutive seasons when he recorded his 12th sack of the season in Week 11, as well set the record for the most sacks by a player under the age of 30.

Garrett had three games this season with at least three sacks, with his best game of the season against the Patriots in Week 8 with five sacks. His five sacks in Week 8 not only set a season-high, but also broke his own Browns' record for the most sacks in a game. Garrett recorded at least a half of a sack in nine straight games, the longest streak of his career.

""Having these games that he's been having lately, it's like the sky is really the limit,"" DT Maliek Collins said on Nov. 24. ""Whatever he put his mind to he can achieve. I see the little personal notes he writes himself. I see how he comes in and the type of positivity he speaks with. Just the things that he wants to accomplish in his career. I don't think I've ever been around a more driven person in my career or played with a more driven person just based on how he goes about his days, how infatuated he is with getting to the quarterback, but also just with his all-around play and his lifestyle in general, the way he takes care of his body.""

Going back to the offseason, Cesaire saw Garrett take his preparation to another level, with a more focused and purpose-driven offseason. He watched how Garrett did not lose a rep in one-on-ones all throughout training camp, moving at full speed with each snap.

During those early weeks of camp, Cesaire thought to himself that Garrett was preparing to have a special season.

""Preseason, camp, all those joint practices, it was personal for him,"" Cesaire said. ""He was going out there to prove, I think to himself, just how good he can be. And what I mean, he didn't lose a one-on-one rep. And I was just excited for the buildup of the upcoming season because I was like wow. I was just looking around at the guys that we already had out there and how we were playing in rushing because I can't wait until we get Myles and see what he can do this year. And he's just kind of exceeded my expectations on how to play this game.""

Cesaire has believed all along Garrett would break the sack record. He joked with Garett that this would be the season he would break the record, and he had Garrett write down on the board in the defensive line room a total for the season. At first, the number was 24. Then, they changed the number to 25.

""I'm happy for him, not just because of the person he is, but just by the way he works,"" Cesaire said. ""We put a premium on working hard in this room and doing things the right way, and he does that every single day.""

As Garrett reflected weeks before he broke the record, he highlighted how the individual accolade comes with the support of his teammates surrounding him. With the mindset that the defensive line moves as one unit, the effort and success of Collins, DT Mason Graham, DE Alex Wright or DE Isaiah McGuire created opportunities for Garrett to reach opposing quarterbacks.

""I wouldn't be here in the position I'm in to even challenge the record without them,"" Garrett said on Nov. 28. ""Those guys have helped elevate my game, and hopefully I've helped elevate them as well. The level of chemistry and synergy that we've been rolling with, especially after the (Minnesota) Vikings, after the (Pittsburgh) Steelers, I think I got back healthy, and guys were feeling good and we've really been playing up to our potential since then.""

Teammates and coaches alike have expressed their utmost support and admiration of what Garrett has accomplished throughout the season. While they strived to play their role in the overall success of the Browns' defense, they also provided their support in helping Garrett reach a historic milestone.

""When it comes to Myles, we're 1,000 percent all in to do whatever it takes to get Myles to that point,"" safeties coach Ephraim Banda said on Dec. 5. ""We talk about it in the room. Let's get him off the first look, let's get him off the second look, so Myles can get to this record that's historic and it's a team deal. We're all wanting to do that with him, for him.""

While the much of the focus throughout the 2025 season has surrounded Garrett's sack numbers, head coach Kevin Stefanski and defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz continuously shared their praise for Garrett's effectiveness in how he defends against the run.

""I want to be remembered as one of the very best at the position, and that includes being well-rounded, in the run and pass,"" Garrett said. ""I know the record for TFL's is 39 and I feel like I can go and challenge that – that's not out of reach either. So, got to continue this level of play and elevate and pick it up as much as I can. So, as much as people want to see me break the sack record, I think there are other things out there which I want to achieve, and I think will help the team win.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/browns/lfmwqwd2uwj4hdlfqnzp,N,,2026-01-04 16:58:14.589494

McCarthy exited Sunday’s Week 18 game against the Green Bay Packers early in the third quarter. He was favoring his right hand, the same hand that caused him to miss last week’s game.

McCarthy was replaced by rookie Max Brosmer and did not return. The Vikings went on to win 16-3 to finish the season with a 9-8 record.

Vikings coach Kevin O’Connell reported last week that McCarthy had a “very, very small hairline fracture” in his right hand. They deemed him capable enough to play in Week 18, as long as he showed enough grip strength. He clenched his hand a couple of times on Sunday but threw for 182 yards on 14-of-23 passing.

McCarthy completed an 8-yard pass to superstar receiver Justin Jefferson to start the second half, then immediately waved over at the trainers.

The franchise’s future at quarterback is murky. The Vikings drafted McCarthy to be the future of their franchise, but his lack of availability and poor early-season performance have raised plenty of questions. McCarthy’s accuracy and decisiveness improved during the second half of the season, but the organization’s decision-makers are entering their fifth season without a playoff win.

While it was initially unclear why McCarthy needed to leave the contest, the Vikings later ruled him questionable to return due to a right hand injury.

McCarthy missed the team's Week 17 game after sustaining a hairline fracture in his right hand in Week 16. Despite the injury, McCarthy returned to practice ahead of Week 18. After being limited in practice Wednesday, McCarthy turned in a full practice Thursday, and was deemed healthy enough to start the contest.

After leaving the game in the third quarter, McCarthy was replaced by rookie Max Brosmer, who took a sack on his second passing attempt of the day.

Brosmer remained in the game on the Vikings' next offensive drive, a sign McCarthy could be done for the day.

If that's it for McCarthy, it ends a roller-coaster season for the first-year starter. After being selected with the No. 10 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, McCarthy missed his entire rookie season while recovering from knee surgery.

Despite a successful season with Sam Darnold under center in 2024, the Vikings allowed Darnold to leave in free agency, paving the way for McCarthy to open the season as the team's unquestioned starter.

That decision backfired. Darnold led the Seattle Seahawks to the No. 1 seed in the NFC this season, while McCarthy struggled to find his footing as an NFL starter. McCarthy also battled injuries again, limiting his time under center.

Advertisement

In his nine starts prior to Week 18, McCarthy completed 57.3 percent of his passes for 11 touchdowns against 12 interceptions. McCarthy did not throw a touchdown or an interception before leaving in Week 18. He completed 14 of 23 passes for 182 yards before exiting Sunday's game.

The Vikings went on to win the contest 16-3 after the Packers' offense couldn't get much traction with third-string quarterback Clayton Tune getting the start.

The Vikings will be forced to make a tough decision in the offseason. McCarthy had moments of brilliance during the season — a Week 1 comeback win over the Chicago Bears and a three-touchdown performance against the Washington Commanders in Week 14 stand out — but too often failed to elevate his game enough to lift the offense to its previous heights under Darnold. After ranking ninth in points per game last season, the Vikings fell to 26th in the metric in 2025.

Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell will need to decide whether McCarthy showed enough in his first healthy season to warrant another shot as a starer or whether the team needs an upgrade at the position.

The Vikings still has a strong defense and multiple offensive playmakers, so an upgrade at quarterback could go a long way toward the team getting back into contention as early as next season.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FkTTBBu3b4n9N.RHja950w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/3adae680-e9a7-11f0-bf7b-d250d47c4c7e,N,,2026-01-04 17:59:14.872794

But that doesn't mean every Lions star will be playing.

The Lions will be playing the Chicago Bears on Sunday, Jan. 4, at 4:25 p.m. ET at Soldier Field in Chicago (Fox). Offensive tackle Penei Sewell has already been ruled out while defensive tackle Alim McNeill and linebacker Alex Anzalone won't be playing, either.

However, receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and offensive guard Christian Mahogany, who were both listed as questionable on the Friday injury report, are active for today's game and are expected to play.

Joining the list of players out for the Chicago game are offensive tackle Gio Manu and center Trystan Colon, leaving Detroit's offensive line once again without much depth heading into its final game of the season. One Detroit offensive lineman expected to play is veteran tackle Taylor Decker, who has been dealing with a shoulder injury all season and might be playing in his final NFL game today.

We'll have all the injury updates from Detroit's final game of the season right here.

That should improve heading into the postseason according to head coach Kyle Shanahan.

There was a scare on the 49ers' final defensive play when quarterback Brock Purdy was sandwiched between two Seahawks defensive linemen. Purdy stayed down for a long time after being hit before eventually jogging off the field. Shanahan after the game indicated in his postgame press conference that it was a stinger in Purdy's non-throwing shoulder. That issue isn't expected to linger into the postseason.

Later in his press conference he noted something interesting that gives some optimism for their offense after a dreadful performance Saturday night where they managed to post only three points while averaging a paltry 4.1 yards per play.

Shanahan was asked whether left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall, who both missed Saturday's game, were close to playing Saturday. His answer gives some optimism for their chances to suit up on wild card weekend.

""They were pushing it,"" Shanahan said. ""It would've been too risky to play them though. They pushed it all the way up to the end, but it wouldn’t have been the smartest decision by us to let them.”

When asked if they might've been able to play if the 49ers were playing Sunday instead of Saturday, Shanahan answered in the affirmative.

""Oh, yeah. Much better chance.”

If both players had a chance to play Sunday, it stands to reason they're on track to be ready for next week when the 49ers will play either Saturday, Sunday or Monday depending on how the rest of the standings shake out. There are still some questions about the health of the already banged up 49ers defense after a rash of injuries in the season finale, but signs point toward their offense being something closer to full strength when the playoffs begin.","https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/04/SNIN/88015391007-usatsi-27926765.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-04 18:59:10.703846

Ward was slow to get up following linebacker Foye Oluokun’s tackle that drove him into the ground and ended up getting checked out in the team’s medical tent. But he left there and walked into a nearby tunnel opposite the team’s locker room, presumably to get taken to the onsite X-ray machine at Everbank Stadium.

The team initially said he was questionable to return, but then ruled him out a few minutes later.

Journeyman backup Brandon Allen, a sixth-round draft pick by Jacksonville in 2016, replaced Ward on the next possession. It was the first snaps Ward has missed this season.

Ward, the No. 1 overall pick, has the franchise rookie record with 3,117 yards passing. He needed a season-high 271 yards to move into the top 10 for a single season in team history.

Ward had thrown two touchdown passes in four straight games.

Ward was ruled out with a shoulder injury suffered on a touchdown drive in the first quarter, Tennessee's only score in the first half as the Jaguars lead 31-7 on Jan. 4 at EverBank Field.

Ward had not missed an offensive snap all season before the injury. Brandon Allen made his Titans debut in the first half and has thrown a pick-six to Jaguars safety Antonio Johnson.

Cam Little makes 67-yard field goal at halftime buzzer after Titans hand Jags scoring opportunity

The Titans' toothless end-of-half strategy has been a major issue all season, across two head coaches.

It strikes again in Week 18. The Titans, with two timeouts and the ball near midfield, opt to run clock down in between a screen and a checkdown that go nowhere.

Despite having two timeouts, the clock runs down to nine seconds and the Titans go for it on 4th and 8 from their own 49. Brandon Allen's pass is tipped and incomplete.

With three seconds left, it allows Jacksonville to try a field goal with strong-legged Cam Little.

He hits from 67 yards out. The Titans coaching staff again navigates the end of the first half in just about the worst way.

Halftime score: Jaguars 31, Titans 7.

Trevor Lawrence is 16-of-19 for 181 yards and 3 touchdowns in the first half.

Corey Levin has been ruled out with a bicep injury. Levin had been in at right guard for Kevin Zeitler, who was questionable to return with a quad injury.

Brandon Allen targets Elic Ayomanor on a 3rd and long crosser, but the pass is right to Antonio Johnson who returns the interception for a touchdown. 58 yards.

PAT good. Jaguars 21, Titans 7 with 8:07 left.

The Titans offense is in a tough spot today with Ward ruled out and Brandon Allen making his first appearance this year. Add in the season-long changes at playcaller and head coach plus rookie receivers, and this is how it can look. The positive: Tennessee has plenty of time to get back into the game.

Despite a strong finish, Ward ranked among the league's worst quarterbacks in several key statistical categories.

JACKSONVILLE ― Tennessee Titans rookie quarterback Cam Ward's season is over after he's been ruled out with a right shoulder injury in Week 18 against Jacksonville.

Ward ends his rookie season having started all 17 games, leading the team to three wins. He threw 15 touchdowns with seven interceptions and ran for two more touchdowns, including the one on which he injured his shoulder. He finishes his rookie season with 3,169 passing yards, a Titans franchise record among rookie passers.

After starting the season slow, Ward threw multiple touchdowns in each of his last four complete games, leading the Titans to wins over Cleveland and Kansas City during that stretch.

Looking at the season in totality, Ward finished among the league's worst quarterbacks statistically. He came into Week 18 ranked in the bottom three in the NFL in completion percentage, passer rating, yards per attempt and passing success rate.

The Titans drafted Ward with the No. 1 pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, trying to capture the magic Ward spun in his college stops at Incarnate Ward, Washington State and Miami. Ward left Miami as the NCAA Division I's all-time leader in touchdown passes.

Without Ward, the Titans will turn to Brandon Allen for the remainder of Sunday's game versus the Jaguars.

The Titans head into the offseason with a coaching search ranking as the top priority.

The 105th edition of the Battle of Ohio pits two teams not going anywhere but into the offseason. The Browns, though, will do so with many more questions to answer than the Cincinnati Bengals.

Cleveland will have to answer the question of coach Kevin Stefanski's future, as well as that of general manager Andrew Berry. It has a quarterback question it hopes it gets more answers on in Shedeur Sanders' seventh start, and an All-Pro defensive end, Myles Garrett, who would like to end the season the answer to the question ""Who holds the NFL single-season sack record?""

So what happened in Cincinnati? Follow here for updates:

Joe Burrow outruns Myles Garrett for 8-yard gain

Myles Garrett was bearing down on Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow. Garrett, though, wasn't going to be able to get to Burrow, who managed to run for a 8-yard gain.

Andre Szmyt knocks through a 27-yard FG for Browns

The Browns got points on their first drive of the second half when Andre Szmyt kicked a 27-yard field goal with eight minutes left in the third quarter. They nearly had a 37-yard touchdown pass from Shedeur Sanders to Sal Cannella, but Cannella couldn't come down with the ball in the end zone.

Cleveland leads 17-12 over Cincinnati.

Tyson Campbell expected to return

The Browns have announced cornerback Tyson Campbell is expected to return. He was originally questionable with a first-quarter shoulder injury.

Jerry Jeudy picks up 4th down on jet sweep

Wide receiver Jerry Jeudy bobbled the ball, but still managed to hold onto it for a 5-yard gain on a jet sweep to convert a fourth-and-1 from the Browns 44.

Denzel Ward ruled out for rest of game

The Browns have ruled out cornerback Denzel Ward for the remainder of the game. He left the game in the first quarter with a neck injury.

Halftime: Cleveland Browns 14, Cincinnati Bengals 12

Despite being outgained 231-40 in the first half, the Browns have the lead at halftime. They also will get the kick to open the second half.

Joe Burrow to Tee Higgins for Bengals TD

Joe Burrow threw a perfect fade route to Tee Higgins for a 13-yard touchdowh with 29 seconds remaining in the half. Evan McPherson, however, missed his second PAT of the game to keep the Browns' lead at 14-12.

Joe Flacco put in game to QB sneak for 1st down

The Bengals put backup quarterback Joe Flacco in out of the two-minute warning to pick up two yards on a third-and-1 quarterback sneak from the Cleveland 30. Joe Burrow came back in on the next play.

Flacco, in case you somehow forgot, was the Browns' starting quarterback for the first four games. He was traded to the Bengals Oct. 7.

Shedeur Sanders with big losses on back-to-back plays

Shedeur Sanders had back to back double-digit losses on sacks that pushed the Browns into a third-and-31 situation from their own 13. Sanders lost 11 yards on one play, and then lost 10 on the next.

The Browns ultimately had to punt with 7:13 remaining in the first half.

Another defensive score for Cleveland Browns

The Browns have two touchdowns, and neither of them were scored by their offense. This time, cornerback Sam Webb picked up a Noah Fant fumble caused by linebacker Jerome Baker and returned it 47 yards for a touchdown.

Another unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, this one on Webb, led to another 48-yard Andre Szmyt PAT kick. Szmyt made it, pushing the Browns lead to 14-6 with 14:06 remaining in the second quarter.

Tyson Campbell's shoulder, Denzel Ward's neck have both questionable

The Browns announced both cornerbacks Denzel Ward and Tyson Campbell were questionable to return with injuries. Campbell has a shoulder injury, and Ward has a neck injury.

End 1st quarter: Cleveland Browns 7, Cincinnati Bengals 6

The Bengals have a third-and-2 from their own 38 coming out of the quarter break.

Tyson Campbell to the locker room with injury

Tyson Campbell went to the Browns locker room accompanied by medical staff after spending time in the medical tent. Still no official word on the injury.

Devin Bush turns Shelby Harris' tipped pass into pick 6 for Browns

The Browns have turned a Joe Burrow turnover into a touchdown. Linebacker Devin Bush intercepted a Burrow pass that was tipped by defensive tackle Shelby Harris and returned it 97 yard for a Browns touchdown.

Bush was called for unsportsmanlike conduct after the score, forcing Andre Szmyt to kick a 48-yard PAT. Szmyt's kick was good to give the Browns the 7-6 lead with 56 seconds left in the first quarter.

Tyson Campbell shaken up, and Denzel Ward not on field

The Browns appear to be down both starting cornerbacks after Tyson Campbell appeared to suffer a shoulder injury while in on a play against Ke'Shawn Williams with 2:08 remaining in the first quarter. He went to the medical tent for further evaluation.

Denzel Ward, meanwhile, hasn't been on the field for a large percentage of the possession. There's been no word on why.

Bengals turn Shedeur Sanders fumble into Joe Burrow TD pass

The Bengals took a 6-0 lead with 7:59 remaining in the first quarter when Cincinnati's Joe Burrow hit running back Chase Brown coming out of the backfield for a 4-yard touchdown. Alex Wright got a finger on Evan McPherson's PAT kick, which forced it to go wide right.

Shedeur Sanders strip sacked by Cincinnati Bengals

Quarterback Shedeur Sanders gave up the ball on the Browns' first drive. Cam Sample got in and stripped Sanders from behind, and Howard Cross III fell on it for the Bengals at the Cleveland 29 with 10:22 remaining in the first quarter.

JACKSONVILLE ―Tennessee Titans quarterback Cam Ward went into the sideline injury tent and later the locker room to be examined by the athletic training staff after a rushing touchdown on the Titans' opening drive against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Per an announcement in the press box, Ward has a shoulder injury and his return to the game is questionable. The injury in question is to Ward's right throwing shoulder.

Ward was favoring his shoulder coming off the field. He initially sat on the bench for a few seconds before the tent was raised and he went in for further examination. After a minute or two in the tent, Ward walked into the locker room under his own strength.

Ward has played every snap for the Titans on offense throughout his rookie season. The only other quarterback the Titans have on the active roster is Brandon Allen.

Cam Ward injury

Ward had to leave the game after lunging to score on a designed run play from inside the red zone. Ward rushed to the offense's right, following blockers toward the pylon and dove toward the end zone. He landed awkwardly on the ball and a Jaguars defender, bouncing into the end zone for the score.

He remained on the ground for a moment after the play but was able to get up under his own strength and walk toward the sideline. Ward hasn't dealt with any injury concerns across his rookie season, and with his start on Sunday became the first Titans quarterback since Ryan Tannehill in 2021 to start every game in a season.

NFL Week 18 Predictions & Cheat Sheet for PrizePicks, NFL DFS

Find the top Week 18 predictions, picks, matchups to target, and players to target in Sunday's games below in the PrizePicks Cheat Sheet, including analysis on QBs, RBs, WR vs. CB matchups, and OL vs. DL mismatches.

Best QB Predictions for NFL Week 18

Here are two of the top QB vs. defense matchups for fantasy football and PrizePicks NFL this week to help you make your NFL Week 18 predictions.

Browns QB Shedeur Sanders vs. Bengals Defense

Shedeur Sanders gets a nice opportunity here against a Cincinnati secondary that has been one of the league’s weakest units for most of the season. The Bengals rank dead last in the NFL in passing TDs allowed (26) and sit 18th in passing yards afforded overall.

While the Bengals have shown marginal improvement since Week 12, they still 29th in EPA per dropback, per SumerSports. Cleveland has clearly given Sanders the green light, allowing him to operate aggressively from under center. In his limited starts this season, he’s averaging 29 pass attempts.

Against a defense that continues to struggle containing QBs, Sanders may be set up to make another statement before his rookie season closes.

Texans QB C.J. Stroud vs. Colts Defense

Indianapolis enters this matchup severely shorthanded on defense, with CB Sauce Gardner ruled out and DT DeForest Buckner placed on injured reserve. Since Week 12, the Colts rank 31st in passing yards and 30th in completions allowed, showing a clear inability to stop anything through the air.

That sets the stage for C.J. Stroud, who has led Houston’s surge. Despite missing time due to injury, he still ranks top 20 in passing yards (2,087), top 25 in passing TDs (18), and top 20 in average depth of target (8.6). He’s now just two TDs away from matching his 2024 total, and against a depleted Colts secondary, this may be an ideal spot to close that gap quickly.

Week 18 Prediction for PrizePicks: CJ Stroud – 211.5 Passing Yards

Best RB Predictions for NFL Week 18

Here are two of the top RB vs. defense matchups to target for fantasy football and PrizePicks NFL this week to help you make your NFL Week 18 predictions.

Bears RB D’Andre Swift vs. Lions Defense

Since Week 13, the Detroit Lions have been one of the weakest run defenses in the league, allowing 5.3 yards per carry (second-worst) and 152.6 rushing yards per game (fifth-most). That inefficiency has also shown up in the red zone, where Detroit has surrendered eight rushing TDs over that span, the third-most in the NFL.

Can D'Andre Swift exploit this matchup? In head coach Ben Johnson’s first season, the RB ranks top 15 in rushing yards (1,047), top 10 in rushing TDs (9), and is averaging an impressive 4.9 yards per carry. Against a front that has been consistently gashed on the ground, Swift may offer both a high floor and a high ceiling.

Rams RB Kyren Williams vs. Cardinals Defense

While much of the attention in Los Angeles has gone to QB Matthew Stafford and WRs Davante Adams and Puka Nacua, Kyren Williams continues to quietly deliver an elite rushing season. He ranks top 10 in rushing yards (1,192), top 10 in rushing TDs (10), and averages 4.8 yards per carry.

Since Week 13, the Arizona Cardinals have struggled badly against the run, allowing 4.52 yards per carry, 151.8 rushing yards per game (sixth-worst in the NFL), and eight rushing TDs (tied for third-most over that stretch). Williams could be set up for another strong workload and efficient outing.

{{nfl_offer_banner=""/style-system/ui-components-playbook""}}

Best WR vs. CB Matchups to Target: Week 18

Here are two of the top WR vs. CB matchups to target for fantasy football and PrizePicks NFL this week to help you make your NFL Week 18 predictions.

Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb vs. Saints CB Paulson Adebo

The New York Giants play man coverage at one of the highest rates in the NFL (29.9%, per Sharp Football Analysis), and CeeDee Lamb has consistently shredded man defenses. He ranks fourth in the NFL in receiving yards and ninth in receptions vs. man.

This matchup could favor Lamb, who thrives on separation and route nuance against this style of defense. He is expected to see plenty of snaps against CB Paulson Adebo, who ranks 85th out of 112 corners in coverage (via Pro Football Focus) and is allowing nearly a 100 passer rating and 11.1 yards per reception.

This is a potential leverage spot for Dallas’ top weapon.

Jaguars WR Jakobi Meyers vs. Titans CB Darrell Baker Jr.

The Tennessee Titans' secondary remains a liability, and CB Darrell Baker Jr. has been one of the worst coverage defenders in the league. Baker yields a 135.2 passer rating with 14.8 yards per reception.

That sets up well for Jakobi Meyers, who has been a seamless addition to the Jacksonville Jaguars' offense. Meyers ranks top 25 in receptions, targets, and receiving yards. He averages 11.3 yards per reception and is coming off a 6-catch performance in Week 17.

Against a corner who struggles to limit separation and yardage, Meyers profiles as a possible volume and efficiency play.

Week 18 Prediction for PrizePicks: Jakobi Meyers – 3.5 Receptions

Best OL vs. DL Matchups to Target for NFL Week 18

Here are two of the top OL vs. DL matchups to target for fantasy football and PrizePicks NFL this week to help you make your NFL Week 18 predictions.

Eagles DL vs. Commanders OL

The Philadelphia Eagles' defensive line remains one of the most dominant units in the league. DT Jalen Carter has missed time with injury but still owns 41 total pressures, ranking 16th. EDGE Nolan Smith has also battled injuries, yet in limited action has generated 31 pressures and 2 sacks.

The midseason acquisition of pass rusher Jaelan Phillips has only strengthened the group. He’s produced over 70 pressures on the season with 5 sacks, giving Philadelphia relentless havoc from multiple alignments. That sets up poorly for the Washington Commanders' offensive line, which has been one of the weakest in the NFL.

Starting LT Laremy Tunsil is listed as out, as is G Sam Cosmi. Filling in at RG is Andrew Wylie, who ranks 74th out of 80 guards via PFF. First-round pick Josh Conerly Jr. has struggled mightily, surrendering 43 pressures and 8 sacks with 13 penalties, while LG Chris Paul and C Nick Allegretti have also allowed consistent interior pressure.

This is a severe mismatch for Philadelphia’s front to pounce on.

Browns DL vs. Bengals OL

The Cleveland Browns' defensive line is led by a historically dominant season from DE Myles Garrett, who ranks sixth with 75 pressures and first in sacks with 22. Opposite Garrett, Alex Wright has emerged as a reliable complement, tallying 21 pressures and 7 sacks. Inside, rookie DT Mason Graham has impressed, producing 34 pressures.

That firepower goes head-to-head with a shaky Bengals offensive line tasked with protecting QB Joe Burrow. LT Orlando Brown Jr. has endured a rough season, allowing 41 pressures and 8 sacks. On the right side, Amarius Mims has given up 34 pressures and C Ted Karras has surrendered 19 pressures.

With Cleveland’s pass rush working in near-perfect harmony, this matchup appears to clearly favor the Browns’ front.

Week 18 Prediction for PrizePicks: Joe Burrow – 243.5 Passing Yards

Biggest NFL Week 18 Injuries:

Cam Ward Injury Update

Titans QB Cam Ward exited in the first quarter on Sunday after suffering an injury to his throwing shoulder.

The 2025 first-overall draft pick had played 100% of the Titans offensive snaps coming into today.

Veteran backup Brandon Allen replaced Ward under center.

Brock Purdy Injury Update

49ers QB Brock Purdy took a hard hit on the final play of their loss to the Seahawks on Saturday night.

He stayed down on the ground for a while before heading to the medical tent.

After the game, coach Kyle Shanahan said the quarterback suffered a stinger and could have continued playing if the 49ers got the ball back.

Purdy also suffered a thumb injury during the game.

Those issues mean he could have his practice reps managed in the lead up to the Wild Card Round, but he should be ready to go for the playoff opener.

Despite being listed as questionable for Week 18, Adams is not expected to play.","Week 18 in the NFL can mean everything — and nothing — to a team. For some franchises — like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or New York Giants — there's actually a lot on the line during the final week of the regular season. For others — like the Miami Dolphins and Houston Texans — there's not a ton at stake that is going to drastically change the team's plans moving forward.

Because of that, teams treat the final week of the regular season much differently than every other week. A team that has already secured a postseason spot might opt to rest players, even if they can still move up or down in the seeding. A team that has no shot at the playoffs might opt to rest players too, not risking a catastrophic injury to a key star in a meaningless game.

Now that the final week of the regular season has arrived, here is a full list of inactives for Week 18, including key players like Nico Collins and Justin Herbert, who are reportedly sitting out:

Saints vs. Falcons

Saints inactives: S Ugo Amadi, QB Spencer Rattler, WR Chris Olave, RB Alvin Kamara, OL Xavier Truss, DT Bryan Bresee, DT Nathan Shepherd

Falcons inactives: P Trenton Gill, ILB Ronnie Harrison, DL Brandon Dorlus, OL Michael Jerrell, WR Casey Washington, WR Malik Heath

Browns vs. Bengals

Browns inactives: TE Harold Fannin Jr., T Jeremiah Byers, C Kingsley Eguakun, WR Jamari Thrash, TE David Njoku, DT Sam Kamara

Bengals inactives: QB Jake Browning (Emergency 3rd QB), WR Charlie Jones, CB Josh Newton, S Daijahn Anthony, DE Joseph Ossai, TE Cam Grandy, DT Jordan Jefferson

Advertisement

Colts vs. Texans

Colts inactives: CB Sauce Gardner, DT Eric Johnson II, S Reuben Lowery III, TE Will Mallory, S George Odum, QB Philip Rivers

Texans inactives: CB Kamari Lassiter, WR Nico Collins, WR Braxton Berrios, QB Graham Mertz, RB Nick Chubb, LB Jamal Hill, OT Trent Brown

Key absence: Nico Collins, WR, Houston Texans

The Houston Texans are safely in the playoffs, though the team could see its seeding move quite a bit depending on what happens in Week 18. The Texans enter the week as the No. 5 seed in the AFC, though the team could move as high as No. 3 and as low as No. 7 based on what happens during the final week of the regular season.

Advertisement

Despite that, star wideout Nico Collins is not expected to play when the Texans take on the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. Collins is not injured, and is considered a healthy scratch for the contest.

The 26-year-old is coming off yet another strong season, in which he hauled in 71 catches for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns. That performance earned Collins his second straight Pro Bowl nod.

Instead of pushing Collins for another week, the Texans will give the star some rest before the playoffs begin. After missing some time last season, Collins has stayed relatively healthy in 2025, missing just one game this season. Still, the Texans don't want to take any chances with their star ahead of the postseason.

Betting impact: Despite Collins' absence, there was minimal line movement, with the Texans going from -10 to -10.5.

Advertisement

Titans vs. Jaguars

Titans inactives: S Amani Hooker, OLB Arden Key, OG Drew Moss, OG Garrett Dellinger, OT Brandon Crenshaw-Dickson, TE Gunnar Helm

Jaguars inactives: CB Keith Taylor, OL PAtrick Mekari, TE Hunter Long, TE Patrick Herbert, DL Emmanuel Ogbah, DT Maason Smith

Packers vs. Vikings

Packers inactives: QB Malik Willis, LB Quay Walker, RB Josh Jacobs, WR Dontayvion Wicks, S Xavier McKinney, OT Zach Tom, LB Edgerrin Cooper

Vikings inactives: WR Myles Price, QB John Wolford (Emergency 3rd QB), QB Brett Rypien, RB Aaron Jones Sr., OT Walter Routes, TE T.J. Hockenson

Key absence: Jordan Love, QB, Green Bay Packers

The Green Bay Packers are the No. 7 seed in the NFC. The team can't move out of that spot. Because of that, Jordan Love, despite being cleared from a concussion, isn't expected to play in Week 18.

Advertisement

And with backup Malik Willis also dealing with injuries, the Packers announced earlier in the week Clayton Tune will get the start against the Minnesota Vikings. Willis will be inactive for the contest, and Love will serve as Tune's backup.

Since the news was announced previously, Love's absence shouldn't come as a surprise. Running back Josh Jacobs is also out.

Betting impact: Once it became clear the Packers were resting starters, the Vikings' line jumped from -6.5 to -12.5.

Cowboys vs. Giants

Cowboys inactives: LB DeMarvion Overshown, CB Shavon REvel, S Alijah Clark, DT Jay Toia, DT Perrion Winfrey

Giants inactives: S Jevón Holland, WR Ryan Miller, WR Jalin Hyatt, RB Dante Miller, OLB Caleb Murphy, TE Theo Johnson, QB Russell Wilson (Emergency 3rd QB)

NFL players expected to sit out in Week 18

The following players don't play in the early slate in Week 18, but are expected to sit Sunday:

Chargers vs. Broncos

Chargers inactives: TBA

Giants inactives: TBA

Key absence: Justin Herbert, QB, Los Angeles Chargers

The Los Angeles Chargers have little to play for in Week 18. The team can move around in the AFC playoff seeding, but would still go on the road for every one of its first-round matchups.

Because of that, quarterback Justin Herbert is expected to sit, along with running back Omarion Hampton, pass rusher Khalil Mack and safety Derwin James. Herbert, Mack and James aren't battling injuries and are expected to miss the game against the Denver Broncos due to rest.

Advertisement

Herbert turned in another solid season with the Chargers. The 27-year-old finished the year with 3,727 yards and 26 touchdowns.

Key absence: Omarion Hampton, RB, Los Angeles Chargers

Rookie running back Omarion Hampton is also expected to sit for the Chargers in Week 18. Hampton missed a significant amount of time as a rookie thanks to an ankle injury. He played in just nine games, rushing for 545 yards and four touchdowns.

Hampton will miss Week 18 due to an ankle injury as well. He did not practice all week, and was ruled out for the game after the Friday practice report. His absence — unlike Herbert's or Mack's shouldn't come as a major surprise.

Advertisement

Hampton is hoping to play in the team's first playoff game, so the injury isn't expected to be serious.

Betting impact: Once it became clear the Chargers would treat Week 18 as a rest week, the line moved from Broncos -7.5 to Broncos -14, a significant jump.

Dolphins vs. Patriots

Dolphins inactives: TBA

Patriots inactives: TBA

Key absence: De'Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins

At 7-9, the Miami Dolphins have nothing to play for in Week 18. With the season essentially over, star running back De'Von Achane will reportedly sit out the final game of the regular season. He won't be the only key player on the team to miss the contest against the New England Patriots, as wideout Jaylen Waddle is also expected to sit.

Advertisement

It turned out to be an exceptional third season for Achane, who rushed for a career-high 1,350 yards and scored eight rushing touchdowns. He led the league in yards per attempt at 5.7.

Achane was also a threat as a receiver, gaining 488 yards through the air and scoring four receiving touchdowns. That performance earned him his first-ever trip to the Pro Bowl.

Given that there's little on the line for the Dolphins in Week 18, the move was likely made to ensure Achane stays healthy heading into the offseason. The Dolphins are a team that could experience major change after Week 18, as head coach Mike McDaniel could be fired and former starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa could also be on his way out. That could make Achane the most important player on the team's offense next season, which is a good reason to not risk a major injury in Week 18.

Key absence: Jaylen Waddle, WR, Miami Dolphins

Much like Achane, the Dolphins likely feel there's no reason to risk one of their top offensive players in a meaningless game. Also like Achane, Waddle could be one of the most impactful offensive players on the team next season, especially if the Dolphins also move on from Tyreek Hill.

Advertisement

Waddle finished his fifth NFL season with 910 receiving yards and six touchdowns. He hasn't hit the highs he showed early in his career, but remains a strong player who could take a step forward if Hill is shipped out in the offseason.

Betting impact: With both Achane and Waddle expected to sit vs. the Patriots, the Dolphins' line moved from +11.5 to +13.

Cardinals vs. Rams

Cardinals inactives: TBA

Rams inactives: TBA

Key absence: Davante Adams, WR, Los Angeles Rams

Los Angeles Rams wideout Davante Adams was able to return to practice in limited fashion during the week, but will receive another week of rest for his hamstring. Despite being listed as questionable for Week 18, Adams is not expected to play. He reportedly wanted to get out there, but head coach Sean McVay told him to rest up for the playoffs.

Ole Miss (13-1) will meet Miami (12-2) in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal on Thursday.
Coming into the 2025 season, Simmons was viewed as the clear successor to former Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart, who was a first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.
Simmons, a former four-star recruit, signed with Ole Miss in the Class of 2023 after reclassifying up by two years.
This season, Simmons started the first two games of the season and appeared in eight total, completing 45 of 75 passes for 744 yards, four touchdowns and five interceptions.","Ole Miss quarterback Austin Simmons plans to enter the transfer portal, his father, David Simmons, confirmed.

The redshirt sophomore quarterback began the season as the Rebels’ starter but gave way to transfer Trinidad Chambliss after suffering an ankle injury in September. Chambliss hung on to the starting job after starting in Simmons’ place, and Simmons has served as the Rebels’ backup during their run to the College Football Playoff semifinals.

ESPN and On3 first reported Simmons’ intention to transfer. Simmons intends to stay with the Rebels through the remainder of their Playoff run, according to On3. Ole Miss (13-1) will meet Miami (12-2) in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal on Thursday.

Coming into the 2025 season, Simmons was viewed as the clear successor to former Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart, who was a first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. Simmons, a former four-star recruit, signed with Ole Miss in the Class of 2023 after reclassifying up by two years. He served as Dart’s backup in 2024 and earned his college degree by the time he was 19.

This season, Simmons started the first two games of the season and appeared in eight total, completing 45 of 75 passes for 744 yards, four touchdowns and five interceptions. He also ran for a touchdown.

Simmons will enter the portal as a graduate transfer and will have two years of eligibility left.

What will the market look like for Simmons?

Despite Simmons’ lack of extensive college playing time — he has 262 career snaps in three years — he’ll be a coveted transfer because of his talent level. The lefty has a terrific arm, is a versatile athlete and would easily be one of the 10 best transfer quarterbacks available in this portal cycle.

In recent months, as Chambliss became a Heisman Trophy candidate, the Rebels barreled toward the Playoff and Lane Kiffin prepared his eventual exit for LSU, Simmons was rumored to be a potential target for multiple teams that would be seeking a transfer quarterback for 2026, including LSU and Miami. Kiffin’s move to LSU only fueled further speculation on that Simmons might head to Baton Rouge, but early reports indicate that Missouri is the team to watch in the race for Simmons.

If he clears waivers, Pharms could return to the practice squad where his roster elevations will reset for the postseason, giving the Patriots flexibility.
The Patriots also elevated OL Brenden Jaimes and DL Leonard Taylor III from the practice squad.
Starting with Williams, the standout defensive tackle hasn't played in a game since suffering a high-ankle sprain in the Patriots Week 11 victory over the Jets.
As for the Patriots practice squad elevations, Jaimes and Taylor have been elevated for the third time each.","Reinforcements have arrived for Sunday's regular-season finale vs. the Dolphins, with the Patriots activating LT Will Campbell (knee) and DT Milton Williams (ankle) off injured reserve on Saturday.

New England had one open spot on the 53-man roster but needed to make space to activate the two standout linemen for Week 18. The Patriots corresponding move was to waive DT Jeremiah Pharms Jr., who signed to the 53-man roster last week after spending most of the season on the practice squad. If he clears waivers, Pharms could return to the practice squad where his roster elevations will reset for the postseason, giving the Patriots flexibility. The Patriots also elevated OL Brenden Jaimes and DL Leonard Taylor III from the practice squad.

Obviously, it's good news that Campbell and Williams are returning to the lineup for Sunday's regular-season finale at Gillette Stadium, but it's great news that they'll be available for the Patriots upcoming playoff run. Starting with Williams, the standout defensive tackle hasn't played in a game since suffering a high-ankle sprain in the Patriots Week 11 victory over the Jets. Williams was injured just eight plays into that Thursday nighter, exiting the game in the first half and eventually landing on injured reserve. The veteran opened his 21-day practice window last week, but the Patriots held him out against the Jets to let him ramp up to his return.

Before suffering his ankle injury, Williams was one of the Patriots best defenders and one of the NFL's top defensive tackles. Williams ranks fifth among defensive tackles in pressure rate (12.7%) with 17 total pressures, while helping anchor New England's run defense with nine run stops in 11 games. With their standout defensive tackle available, the Patriots run defense was fourth in rush EPA in their first 10 games compared to 30th in their last five games.

Williams, who can shed blocks with the best of them, makes individual plays while also having a trickle-down effect on the Patriots defensive line. Besides fans and Williams himself, star DT Christian Barmore might be the happiest Patriot about Williams' return, as Barmore has been seeing an uptick in double teams without his partner on the inside. Barmore has seen a double-team block on 28 of his 65 pass-rush snaps, or 43.1%, while also getting extra attention against the run. Williams returning should free-up Barmore, and vice versa, with opposing offensive lines having two decide who to double team on each play.

As for Campbell, the standout rookie left tackle returns to the lineup after injuring his knee in a collision in a Week 12 win over the Bengals. The No. 4 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft ranks second among rookie tackles in pressure rate allowed (5.4%) and looked the part of a franchise left tackle before his injury. During the practice week, Campbell was a full participant in all three sessions, signaling that he'll be a full-go this week and into the Patriots postseason run.

Although their rookie left tackle is expected to return, the Patriots will still be down third-rounder Jared Wilson, as the left guard remains in concussion protocol. With some moving parts on the left side of the offensive line, New England's expected starting five is LT Will Campbell, LG Ben Brown, C Garrett Bradbury, RG Mike Onwenu, and RT Morgan Moses. Sunday's game will be the first time Brown and Campbell have started next to each other since Week 4.

As for the Patriots practice squad elevations, Jaimes and Taylor have been elevated for the third time each. Jaimes has played a special teams role on the field goal protection unit, while Taylor logged a run stuff in 22 snaps in last week's win over the Jets. As with Pharms, Jaimes and Taylor's standard elevations will reset in the postseason, giving New England the option to add the two linemen to the game-day roster in the playoffs if needed.

Lastly, Miami elevated RB Jeff Wilson Jr. and LB Derrick McLendon from the practice squad. Wilson Jr. being elevated signals that star RB De'Von Achane, who is listed as doubtful due to a shoulder injury, won't play on Sunday. Achane leads the NFL in yards per carry (5.7) and explosive runs (40), so that's a significant loss for the Dolphins offense. Miami will lean on running backs Ollie Gordon II, Jaylen Wright, and Wilson instead.

On Sunday, the Patriots will be playing for seeding in the AFC playoffs, with a chance at the No. 1 overall seed in the conference. If the Patriots win, they secure a top-two seed in the AFC and could climb to the No. 1 seed with a Broncos loss. If they lose to Miami, they could fall to the No. 3 seed with a Jaguars win. In all, there are five different scenarios for New England: first-round bye, vs. Chargers (most likely), vs. Bills, vs. Jaguars, or vs. Texans in the Wild Card round.

Despite defeat, Chicago was given its credit for going toe to toe in a big primetime road game against the 49ers last week.","Here are my NFL Week 18 best bets:

Detroit +3 at Chicago

One of the bigger stories of the 2025 NFL season has been the fall of the Detroit Lions. Many believed this would be their year to come out of the NFC after going 15-2 last season. One of my best bets in the VSiN Pro Football Betting Guide was the Lions Under 11.5 season wins because losing both coordinators seemed like too much for this team to overcome, and that proved to be the case, especially on offense, where Ben Johnson has the Chicago Bears as the NFC North Champions in his first season as head coach.

Detroit’s playoff hopes ended on Christmas in Minnesota with a 23-10 defeat despite holding Max Brosmer and the Vikings to three net passing yards. Yes, three net passing yards.

Chicago’s hopes of staying in the race for the NFC No. 1 seed fell by the wayside last week as the Bears still had a chance on the game’s final play but fell short in San Francisco. The Bears can still get the 2 seed and another matchup with Green Bay, with a victory over Detroit, but a loss would only drop them to No. 3, where a rematch with the 49ers or a battle with the Rams awaits.

Detroit is playing for pride and a winning season as it currently sits 8-8. So, there is a good reason to expect the Lions not to phone it in here. Meanwhile, the Bears would certainly like some payback for the 52-21 beatdown they suffered in Detroit all the way back in Week 2.

Jared Goff and head coach Dan Campbell are 23-13 ATS together as underdogs in Detroit.

The Bears have lived off turnovers defensively this season, and they are +22 in turnover margin, which is eight better than the next team (Houston +14). They have needed to do so considering Chicago’s rankings of No. 27 in yards allowed (357.3), No. 28 in rushing yards allowed (136), and 22nd in points allowed (24.8).

Despite defeat, Chicago was given its credit for going toe to toe in a big primetime road game against the 49ers last week. On the other hand, Detroit’s last impression on bettors was a disastrous performance in Minnesota. This is the buy low with Detroit here. Chicago, with more to play for and in some cold weather (low 20s), is only laying 3 here? Hmmmm.

Cincinnati -7.5 vs. Cleveland

At 6-10 and 4-12, neither of these teams has anything substantial to play for except for individual pride and records. Cleveland’s Myles Garrett is one sack away from the all-time single-season NFL record. Cincinnati’s Ja’Marr Chase is currently two receptions behind Arizona’s Trey McBride and the LA Rams’ Puka Nacua for the league lead in receptions. As an aside note, before you bet every Chase prop over, keep in mind that these incentive props are already highly taxed.

Cleveland broke a four-game losing streak last week with a 13-6 win over Pittsburgh and got to leave a positive impression in front of the “Dawg Pound” after two previous close home losses to Tennessee and Buffalo over the past month.

Meanwhile, Cincinnati’s offense has been cooking again with Joe Burrow back under center and the offensive line starting to come together.

However, the defense has been the story as Cincinnati has given up three of its lowest four point totals of the season in the last three weeks. After being near historically bad levels in the meat of the season, first-year defensive coordinator Al Golden has implemented more three down linemen packages, and the team has improved its tackling substantially.

The Browns, 30th in total offense and 31st in scoring defense, are not likely to test the Bengals’ defense all that much here. Cincinnati has a chance to end the season on a three-game winning streak and carry some momentum into 2026 with a healthy Burrow.

The team finished with just 173 yards of total offense and only 9 first downs against the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday. The loss cost the 49ers the NFC West crown and the No. 1 seed in the NFC plus home-field advantage in the playoffs.

Star running back Christian McCaffrey was held to just 23 yards rushing and 34 yards receiving on 6 catches, and more surprisingly, he was kept out of the end zone. But McCaffrey wasn’t the only one who struggled.

Quarterback Brock Purdy completed 19 of 27 passes but threw for just 127 yards and an interception, marking the first time this season he didn’t score at least one touchdown. His 64.9 passer rating was also his second-lowest of the year as well.

And while the game was as ugly as could be, it could’ve ended a whole lot worse than it actually did for San Francisco.

Purdy Injured on 49ers’ Final Drive

The game was all but over when San Francisco took the field for its final drive. Trailing 13-3 with 2:20 left in the fourth quarter, a comeback was highly unlikely.

But with the division and No. 1 seed still somewhat in sight, Purdy trudged out to try and find some late-game magic. He found a bloody finger and the blue medical tent instead.

On that last drive, Purdy cut the thumb on his throwing hand open after striking a player’s helmet on a throw. A few plays later, he was sacked on a fourth-and-6 after throwing an incomplete pass intended for tight end George Kittle.

As the Seahawks took the field to run the clock out, Purdy was seen heading to the medical tent. Head coach Kyle Shanahan gave reporters an update on the QB’s status after the game.

“#49ers QB Brock Purdy suffered a stinger on the last play that sent him to the medical tent. Coach Kyle Shanahan said he was OK and could’ve gone back in,” NFL Network’s Rapoport posted on X.

Replays showed Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall blindsiding Purdy from behind right as he got rid of the ball. He was sandwiched between Hall and another defender and laid on the turf for a few moments before getting up.

Fourth-Quarter Woes Continue

Purdy’s potential injury was the story of the game, but what can’t be overlooked is the team’s continued struggles in the fourth quarter.

The 49ers mustered just 68 yards on 11 plays on their two drives in the quarter, while Seattle controlled time of possession 8:37 to 6:23 and ran up 144 yards of offense.

“Including playoffs since 2017, the 49ers are 1-38 under Kyle Shanahan when trailing by 7+ points entering the 4th quarter,” ESPN Insights wrote on X after the game. “The lone win came over the Packers in the 2023 Divisional Round against the Packers. #NFLonESPNInsights.”

“The 49ers are the only team in the NFL that has not won a game when trailing by 10+ points in the 4th quarter since the start of the 2017 season. They are 0-46 in such games,” ESPN’s Field Yates tweeted before the game.

“He’s athletic, he’s got twitch, he’s got speed,” defensive line coach Sean Ryan said of McLendon.
Defensively, the Dolphins will be without safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, who will miss his third game in a row with a calf injury.
Kicker Jason Sanders was not removed from injured reserve on Saturday, meaning Riley Patterson will complete a full season as the Dolphins’ kicker.
The Dolphins entered Week 18 at No.","The Dolphins made their final roster moves of the season on Saturday, elevating linebacker Derrick McLendon and running back Jeff Wilson Jr. from the practice squad.

Wilson’s elevation (his second of the season) is more evidence that De’Von Achane is very unlikely to play because of a shoulder injury. Achane, the NFL’s leader in per carry average (5.7) and the Dolphins’ MVP this season, is listed as doubtful for Sunday’s finale at New England (4:25 p.m., WSVN Fox 7).

If he doesn’t play Sunday, he will end the season with the third-highest rushing total in a season in team history (1350 yards). Achane needs only 23 yards to surpass Ricky Williams’ 2003 rushing total for second on the list. Williams had 1,853 yards rushing in 2002, which is the team record.

McLendon, a training camp standout, was elevated for the second week in a row but is still waiting to make his NFL debut.

He was not active for the Tampa Bay game because Miami needed to keep another offensive linemen active when it was determined last Sunday morning that center Aaron Brewer could not play with a neck injury.

“He’s athletic, he’s got twitch, he’s got speed,” defensive line coach Sean Ryan said of McLendon. “Those are tangible things. Things that stand out to me are his work ethic and his motor. He’s a positive influence on his teammates and coaches. That guy has got a lot of things that really make an intriguing quality prospect.”

Two Dolphins edge rushers are questionable for the game: Chop Robinson (who was in the later stages of concussion protocol on Friday) and Quinton Bell, who is dealing with an illness.

Several other players on offense are questionable for the finale, including receiver Jaylen Waddle (ribs), right tackle Austin Jackson (a new groin injury and a back issue) and center Aaron Brewer (neck). Brewer practiced fully on Friday, but Jackson and Waddle were limited. Waddle said he’s unsure if he will be able to play on Sunday.

Defensively, the Dolphins will be without safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, who will miss his third game in a row with a calf injury.

Linebacker Jordyn Brooks, the NFL’s leading tackle, is questionable with a hamstring injury but will try to play.

Kicker Jason Sanders was not removed from injured reserve on Saturday, meaning Riley Patterson will complete a full season as the Dolphins’ kicker.

This and that

Mike McDaniel’s job security is being portrayed in different ways by different national outlets this weekend. While SI.com’s Albert Breer said his return next season is a “coin toss,” NFL Network said “signs continue to point toward McDaniel returning.”

▪ A reminder heading into the weekend: The Dolphins (7-9), who entered Week 18 standing 11th in draft order, can jump the three 6-10 teams — No. 8 New Orleans, No. 9 Kansas City and No. 10 Cincinnati — if Miami loses at the Patriots and the Saints beat the Falcons, the Chiefs beat the Raiders and the Bengals beat the Browns.

Miami realistically can drop no worse than 13th.

▪ One big concern to emerge this season: Robinson’s regression. He has just 21 tackles and four sacks in 417 defensive snaps, and his 8.8 pass rush win rate is abysmal, 125th among NFL edge players, as Simon Clancy noted.

Pro Football Focus rates him 100 of 113 qualifying edge players. He looks more like a No. 3 outside linebacker than a starter.

▪ After being on the field for every Tampa Bay offensive play last week, Dolphins safety Ashtyn Davis has played 76 percent of Miami’s defensive snaps, putting him in position to earn a $500,000 bonus for playing 60 percent of the team’s snaps. Davis said it speaks very well of the organization that Miami played him instead of sitting him.

Davis’ bonus is contingent on Miami finishing in the top 25 in points allowed, he said. The Dolphins entered Week 18 at No. 21.

Some of Bradley Chubb’s bonuses are tied to Miami finishing in the top 20 in points allowed.

First of all, both G Isaac Seumalo and WR Calvin Austin III are expected to play after missing the Browns game with injuries.
25 ranking for the Ravens; the Browns ranked No.
ANSWER: As a general rule, the NFL does not comment one way or another about specific calls in a game.
And league ownership has shown little appetite to expand replay for the purpose of adding more penalties to the game.","PAUL COSTANZA FROM NORTH ATTLEBORO, MA: Any idea of what the offensive game plan will be on Sunday vs. the Ravens? Try to establish the run first, or utilize the tight ends more? Against the Browns it looked like our WRs could not create separation.

ANSWER: There are a lot of things that will be different about the Steelers offense this week vs. what we saw in Cleveland. First of all, both G Isaac Seumalo and WR Calvin Austin III are expected to play after missing the Browns game with injuries. And the other significant factor is how Baltimore's defense differs from Cleveland's. The Browns defense ranked No. 2 in the NFL in total yards allowed vs. a No. 25 ranking for the Ravens; the Browns ranked No. 2 in the NFL in passing yards allowed per game vs. No. 29 for the Ravens; and the Browns defense ranked No. 2 in the NFL in sacks per pass attempt vs. No. 31 for the Ravens. Because this is a winner-take-all situation, how it happens is not as relevant as the Steelers simply finding a way to score more points than the Ravens.

LARRY LASH FROM TARENTUM, PA: I heard a professional analyst comment on Mason Rudolph never getting a fair chance to be a starting QB in the NFL. Do you think he did, I mean with the Steelers and Titans? What's your opinion and also do you believe he was ever really considered Ben's heir?

ANSWER: My recollection was that when the Steelers spent a No. 3 (76th overall) pick in the 2018 NFL Draft on Mason Rudolph, their quarterback depth chart contained Ben Roethlisberger, Landry Jones, and Joshua Dobbs. Roethlisberger might have been 36, but he still was playing to the level of a franchise QB, and neither Jones nor Dobbs had shown themselves to be special. I believe the Steelers liked Rudolph after the scouting process, and when it came to their pick in the third round, they decided he was a good value. I don't believe the Steelers were shopping for an ""heir,"" but if Rudolph shows himself to be a better backup than Jones, then it was worth it to select him at that point in the draft. I don't know anything about your ""professional analyst"" source, but what I have learned is that the league decides. Players are able to become unrestricted free agents, which means they are free to move wherever and all 32 teams are able to bid on their services. Rudolph hit unrestricted free agency two different times. The league decided what he is.

STEVE SOKOL FROM BEIT SHEMESH, ISRAEL: DK Metcalf's suspension for two games means that he loses two games' salary. Will that money get added to next year's salary cap?

ANSWER: A player who is suspended by the NFL does not receive his salary during the length of the suspension, and his team does not have that money charged to the salary cap. Teams that have salary cap money left after the season ends and everyone has been paid are able to carry that over to the following league year.

JOHN MARTIN FROM ARENDTSVILLE, PA: In regard to the ""no call"" pass interference on the last play vs the Browns, has any official comment come from the league about whether they feel that was a bad ""no call?"" It seems sometimes they come out and comment but most times they do not. Was Aaron Rodgers ever fined for his comments? Also, I know they experimented with allowing coaches to challenge pass interference in the past, is there any talk of bringing that back?

ANSWER: As a general rule, the NFL does not comment one way or another about specific calls in a game. There could be a pool report, where an on-site media member may be granted a brief audience with the game's referee to ask about some specific things. But there is no ""announcement."" I'm not going to claim there are times when information leaks or is leaked, but you catch my drift.

What Aaron Rodgers said and how he said it after the game about that play did not deserve a fine. And league ownership has shown little appetite to expand replay for the purpose of adding more penalties to the game.

SCOTT RANDALL FROM CONWAY, SC: Regardless of how this season ends, do you think Aaron Rodgers is done? The class of college quarterbacks declaring for the NFL Draft doesn't seem elite. Do you think if Will Howard gets in a full preseason that he will have any shot at a chance to be the starter?

ANSWER: A lot of questions in there, and some of them are liberally sprinkled with qualifiers, but all I am willing to opine at this stage of the process is that I would be surprised if the Steelers went to training camp with a QB depth chart that had Will Howard any higher than No. 2. If that means he will ""have any shot at a chance"" then the answer to your last question is a yes.

RAY ZARATE FROM COMSTOCK PARK, MI: Whatever happened to Will Howard? Nothing is ever said about his progression.

ANSWER: Will Howard is the No. 3 quarterback on the 53-man roster. Players in that role do not have progress reports made and then given to the public.

GRANT SPELLERBERG FROM CUTLER BAY, FL: A few weeks back I sent you a question regarding the trade for DK Metcalf and the trading away of George Pickens. If you compare their stats you can see that Pickens' are way better. You made a point indicating that Pickens' behavior was an issue. As it turns out DK may cost the Steelers a playoff spot because of his behavior. Do you still think it was a wise choice for the Steelers to make those trades?

ANSWER: The way I view this submission is that you believe the Steelers were unwise to make those trades, and you're looking for me to agree with you. I'm not really interested in that.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/steelers/tcgscdqxcsrz9qdkvagn,N,,2026-01-04 12:59:07.608904

Purdy walked away the 49ers’ 13-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks battered and bruised.

The 49ers quarterback had his thumb bloodied after he was hit in the second half following a pass attempt.

The hits didn’t stop there for Purdy.

On fourth-and-6 with less than two minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Purdy was sandwiched in the pocket by Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall and defensive lineman Leonard Williams as he threw an incomplete pass. Purdy was on the ground for a moment in visible pain before he walked off the field under his own power.

The Seahawks took over possession of the football and went into victory formation with the game decided.

Was Brock Purdy injured against the Seahawks?

Head coach Kyle Shanahan announced postgame that Purdy suffered a stinger on the desperation play.

“Purdy would’ve went back in,” Shanahan said to reporters. “He checked out all right.”

Purdy was sacked three times and hit three times in the loss. He was pressured on 11 dropbacks, per Pro Football Focus.

San Francisco’s loss prevented them from winning the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs.

Shanahan said Purdy’s stinger won’t prevent him from playing in next week’s wild-card game.

The 49ers have delt with a slew of injuries this season. Linebacker Fred Warner (ankle) and Nick Bosa (knee) suffered season-ending injuries earlier in the season. Standout left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee and ankle) were both inactive on Saturday due to injuries.

San Francisco does expect Williams, Pearsall and Purdy to be available for next week’s road playoff game.

“It would’ve been nice to have both home games here and get a bye, but it is what it is,” Shanahan said. “This team’s been through a lot this year. Now we got to do it the hard way. We’ll embrace the (expletive) out of doing it the hard way. Look forward to it.”","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/04/USAT/88014092007-usatsi-27928241.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y187&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-04 09:02:40.561868

A wild ride in the NFC has resulted in a playoff spot still up for grabs, as the Carolina Panthers and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers face off in a game that could determine the winner of the NFC South.

For both teams, the year has seen a lot of inconsistency, but they could potentially make it into the postseason with a win on Saturday. Neither squad, though, is coming into the game fully healthy.

Inconsistency has been the one constant for the Panthers all season long. At 8-8, they are far from a juggernaut, with their rankings on PFSN’s Offense Impact and Defense Impact at 26 and 25, respectively, further proving that they aren’t as good as their record suggests.

However, they have some wildly impressive wins, including one over the Los Angeles Rams. Now, a clean sweep over the Buccaneers in the season series could finally help them clinch a playoff berth for the first time since 2017.

Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott is not going to end Allen's consecutive starts streak cold turkey.

Allen injured his right foot against the Cleveland Browns in Week 16 and aggravated it in the loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 17. Buffalo can potentially improve their playoff seed on Sunday.

Allen owns the NFL’s longest active consecutive starts streak by a quarterback at 134 games, including 121 regular-season contests and 13 playoff appearances. The streak is tied for the ninth-longest by a quarterback in league history.

""You've got to know, to get (Allen) off the field, you're going to have to ... I'm going to have to wrestle him,"" McDermott said.

The Bills host the New York Jets at 4:25 p.m. Sunday.

Is Josh Allen playing today?

Allen is expected to extend his consecutive starts streak to 135 games, including playoffs.

""He'll be good to go for the game,"" McDermott said his franchise quarterback.

Allen did not practice Wednesday or Thursday and was a limited participant Friday. He's doesn't have a game designation on the Bills' final injury report.

It's possibly Allen only plays a snap or series to extend his consecutive starts streak then gives way to backup Mitchell Trubisky.

Allen had X-rays on his right foot after the Bills' 13-12 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The X-rays were negative. It's the second straight week Allen received X-rays postgame.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Allen's foot feels better now that it did before he played against the Eagles.

""Maybe in a slightly better spot than the early part of last week,"" McDermott said. ""We'll just take it one day at a time and see how he does here through the week.""

Bills quarterback depth chart

Josh Allen

Mitchell Trubisky

Allen is second in the league with 39 combined passing and rushing touchdowns. His overall numbers are similar to his NFL MVP-winning season last year. His completion percentage has ticked up to 69.3% from 63.6% but his interceptions (6 to 10) and sacks (14 to 40) have also increased.

Because Allen is an ironman, Trubisky has only appeared in three games this season, completing 3 of 6 passes for 54 yards.

Buffalo had Shane Buechele on the practice squad all season until he was signed to the Kansas City Chiefs' active roster on Dec. 22.","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/31/PROC/87968561007-getty-images-2253034151.jpg?crop=4940,2779,x3,y79&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-04 09:02:44.884563

And then you have a tipped ball, it’s weird, and then another tip for an interception at the 2-yard line.","The 49ers were beaten and beaten up Saturday night by the Seattle Seahawks in a 13-3 loss that confirmed the 49ers’ place in the wild-card round of the playoffs, while their opponents secured a bye next week.

Brock Purdy was under siege all night and had trouble getting up off the turf after being hit by two Seattle defenders on his final pass of the game, a fourth-down incompletion. Coach Kyle Shanahan said postgame that he suffered a “stinger” nerve pinch in his left shoulder and would have returned to play if the game had not ended.

Purdy was 13-of-27 for 127 yards and an interception, which went off the hands of Christian McCaffrey and into those of Seahawks linebacker Drake Thomas to end the 49ers’ hopes of getting back within a single score early in the fourth quarter. He said he felt good postgame after the injury initially kept him down.

McCaffrey, for his part, led the 49ers in rushing, but he did so with just 23 yards on eight carries. Purdy had two carries for 21 yards. Brian Robinson Jr. had two for nine yards.

McCaffrey also led the team with six receptions, but they netted just 34 yards. Jauan Jennings had 35 yards on four catches and George Kittle had 29 on five receptions. Demarcus Robinson had three catches for 24 yards starting in place of Ricky Pearsall.

Kyle Shanahan

On whether the injuries will linger into next week:

Possibly with Tatum (Bethune) and Dee (Winters). I’m not sure — they say Purdy would have gone back in; he checked out all right.

On the Seahawks’ stifling defense:

It was what we expected, just with their defense, and we expected to do better than we did. … We knew it would be a challenge. They got us in a number of moments, had a couple of opportunities, I thought, that we missed. You can’t miss those against a team like that.

On the key plays:

A chance to recover that fumble could be different, a chance to stop them on third-and-17 on that run could be different. The turnover at the end inside the 5. Their third-and-2, our fourth-and-2. A number of plays that could have made it different.

On the execution of the offense:

Having 40 plays. We couldn’t get the run game going — I think we only had 12 runs. I think we converted one third down in the first half. That was the only series that we got to score on. You convert two third downs in the game, they control the clock for 40 minutes.

On the game:

It’s kind of the opposite of what happened last game. I thought we did better on third downs in Week 1. We had the ball for 40 minutes. We averaged about 3 yards a carry in that game, but we stayed on the field so we were able to get 36 runs. Today the run average was similar, but we only had 12 of them. They controlled the ball, kept it from us and when we had to get something going, we didn’t stay on the field on third (down).

On going on the road in the playoffs as a wild card:

We’re ready for it. It would have been nice to have both home games here and get a bye, but it is what it is. I mean, this team has been through a lot this year. Now we got to do it the hard way and we’ll embrace the (expletive) out of doing it the hard way.

On how close Ricky Pearsall and Trent Williams were to playing:

They were pushing it. It would have been too risky to play them, though.

On whether Pearsall and Williams would have had a better chance to play if the game were Sunday:

Much better chance.

On assessing the Seahawks:

A very good defense, a good offense. I mean, they’ve been showing that they’re one of the best teams in the league all year. That didn’t feel much different than the team we played in Week 1.

I thought Brock battled out there. On the one drive, we got something going, where we turned it over there inside the 5. But he made some big plays on that drive. He battled throughout the game. I know he was under duress. We had a feeling that would be the case going into the game. But none of us played good enough to win, but not disappointed at all in Brock.

On the defense:

We need to tackle better. We need to play better than that. I was proud that they kept battling and was able to hold them to 13 points. That’s what gave us a chance there at the end.

Christian McCaffrey

On the loss:

Obviously we wanted that one. But onward, man. We’re in the playoffs and we don’t have time to sulk over it.

On the interception that went off his hands:

It’s a play that I have to make, absolutely have to make. I expect nothing less, and it’s completely on me.

On the defense’s play and his drop:

The defense did an unbelievable job the whole game. They held them to 13 and that’s huge. It’s on us. Again, I go back to that play that could have put us in the game.

On whether this team can make a run on the road in the playoffs:

This whole season’s been difficult for us and we continue to beat the odds, continue to show people that we’re a real football team. We didn’t show it today. We know that but I love the guys in the locker room and how we’ve responded all year.

Brock Purdy

On the Seattle defense:

Obviously they’re a good defense, good front. They did a good job with making us go through reads and checking the ball down. For me, I just wish I could have been a little bit more efficient. They’re going to make you work for the yards and make you have to convert on third down.

On missing out on the No. 1 seed:

That was our goal, but we can’t dwell on it. We have a pretty quick turnaround here and we got to go win next week. But our team has been through so much adversity, guys going down, next man up. People have counted us out and that’s fine.

On the stinger:

I feel good. Just got hit and the left shoulder sort of lit up. So I feel good right now. We’ll see how I feel tomorrow.

On the offense, which had been rolling, struggling so mightily:

We always feel like there’s plays left out there that we could have converted, we had an opportunity and we just didn’t do the X, Y and Z. … They played good defense. We didn’t execute and when all these other games where we’ve pulled away and had good points and stats and all that stuff, it’s because we execute on the gritty third downs. We stay on the field and then we go score touchdowns after that.

On missing an open Kittle:

It was one of those things where I felt pressure, but at the end of the dya, I need to find a way to set my feet and get it to him and take a hit if I need to. I was concerned with just having my feet set and then I saw george and from where I was at, I didn’t really have a clear picture to be honest, but when we got back to the sideline, it was like ‘Dang, he was there.’

On McCaffrey’s bobbled interception:

That’s a tough play. Ball got tipped at the line, so it came out weird and he’s trying to adjust. He beat his guy, and then all of a sudden, the ball is just coming in weird and it just didn’t go our way and the other guy was right there to catch it right in his lap. … Christian’s a baller, dude. He’s going to live to play the next play and he’s a Hall of Fame running back, so he should walk out with his head up.

George Kittle

On the game:

In the NFL, you have a bad game, any game. Unfortunately, we decided to have a bad game today. Not efficient. What were we, 2-of-9 on third down? Didn’t really get our run game going.

On the loss and the playoffs looming:

We lost at home to a division rival for the division and the 1 seed and that sucks. That just is what it is. Yes, I’m disappointed about it. It’s horrible. Good news is I get to play football next week, whether it’s Saturday, Sunday, Monday, whenever it is. I get to play football again on the road in a hostile environment.

Would I much rather be on a bye and get to play at Levi’s Stadium? Yeah, but that’s just not our reality. So I fully expect our team to come in, and attack it. We have a whole new season ahead of us.

On rooting for the Cardinals against the Rams tomorrow:

I’m not a betting man, but I’m just rooting for Budda Baker to have three pick-sixes tomorrow, that’s it, and Trey McBride have 200 yards, three touchdowns, that’d be awesome.

On the Seattle defense:

They pressured randomly, they brought a lot of pressures, which is what they do. They drop really deep, they force you to check the ball down and they routed the ball really well.

On the frustration of not having an answer to the Seahawks’ defense:

I feel like we kind of did have an answer there at the end. And then you have a tipped ball, it’s weird, and then another tip for an interception at the 2-yard line. We score a touchdown there and it’s 10-13, who knows? It’s a completely different game.

On leaning on handling adversity in prior seasons:

We weren’t missing as many players back then, from Bosa to fred. That’s really tough, but there are experiences that a lot of our vets have gone through and it’s just your back’s against the wall, like what are you going to do?

On the defense’s game:

Shoutout to our defense. I though thtey played a phenomenal game and gave us plenty of opportunities. That’s why I’m so disappointed, because our offense didn’t back up our defense.

On the offense:

I have a ton of confidence in this offense and it just didn’t go our way tonight.

On the Seahawks celebrating in the locker room:

I would do the same (expletive). They won their division, they got the 1-seed, they won in a rival stadium. Good for them.

On the atmosphere at the stadium:

I thought our fans were fantastic. That was really loud Levi’s Stadium. They helped us out so much in the first half. I never blame the fans. We have to give them more to cheer for on offense.",https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BNG-L-49ERS-0104_046da9.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-04 04:58:04.642674

Lamar Jackson will return from a one-game absence to help the Ravens in a must-win game against the Steelers. But a slew of players on teams eliminated from playoff contention are sitting out Week 18. The Jets' Breece Hall, the Cowboys' Javonte Williams and the Cardinals' Marvin Harrison Jr. won't suit up for the regular-season finale.

See who's in and who's out for Week 18:

QB Lamar Jackson (Ravens)

Practice schedule: Full-Full-Full

Injury: Back

Kickoff: 8:20 p.m. ET

Jackson will be active for the Ravens' Week 18 game against the Steelers. He'll return from a one-week absence due to a back injury and be thrusted into a win-or-go home game. Whoever is victorious between the Ravens and Steelers on Sunday night wins the AFC North title and earns the No. 4 seed in the conference.

QB J.J. McCarthy (Vikings)

Practice schedule: Limited-Full-Full

Injury: Hand

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

McCarthy will be active for the Vikings' Week 18 game against the Packers. He missed Week 17 with a right-hand injury, but will be back for Minnesota's regular-season finale. The Vikings are hoping to end the season on a five-game winning streak.

RB Javonte Williams (Cowboys)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Shoulder/Neck

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Williams will miss the Cowboys' final regular-season game against the Giants with injuries to his shoulder and neck. Williams sustained the injuries on Christmas Day against the Commanders.

RB De'Von Achane (Dolphins)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-Limited

Injury: Shoulder

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Achane will be active for the Dolphins' Week 18 game against the Patriots. He's dealing with a shoulder injury, but will tough it out for Miami's regular-season finale.

RB Breece Hall (Jets)

Practice schedule: DNP-Limited-Limited

Injury: Knee

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Hall will miss the Jets' Week 18 game against the Bills. It's his first absence of the 2025-26 season, in which he surpassed the 1,000-yard rushing mark for the first time in his career. Hall will be an unrestricted free agent following this season, so there's a possibility he's played his last snap for New York.

RB Omarion Hampton (Falcons)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Ankle

Kickoff: 4:25 p.m. ET

Hampton will be out for the Chargers' Week 18 game against the Broncos. He's dealing with an ankle injury and the Chargers can't gain any ground in the AFC playoff picture. Los Angeles is sitting a slew of starters, including Hampton and quarterback Justin Herbert.

RB Kyren Williams (Rams)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Full

Injury: Ankle

Kickoff: 4:25 p.m. ET

Williams will be active for the Rams' Week 18 game against the Cardinals. He sustained an ankle injury during the Rams' game against the Falcons last Monday night, but it shouldn't cost him any time. While Los Angeles can't win the NFC West, it is vying for position as the top Wild Card in the NFC.

TE Harold Fannin Jr. (Browns)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Groin

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Fannin will miss the Browns' Week 18 game against the Bengals. He re-aggravated a groin injury on a touchdown catch in Week 17. Before that, though, Fannin set the Browns' franchise rookie record for receptions, hauling in 72 catches this season.

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (Lions)

Practice schedule: DNP-Limited-Limited

Injury: Knee/Ankle

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

St. Brown will be active for the Lions' Week 18 game against the Bears. He's played through injury on numerous occasions this season, and will continue to do so on Sunday despite Detroit being eliminated from the playoffs.

WR Drake London (Falcons)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Knee

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

London will be active for the Falcons' Week 18 game against the Saints. He's dealing with a knee injury, but it won't prevent him from playing on Sunday. While Atlanta is eliminated from playoff contention, a win over the Saints would push the Carolina Panthers into the playoffs regardless of their result against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Saturday.

WR Rome Odunze (Bears)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-Limited

Injury: Foot

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Odunze will miss the Bears' Week 18 game against the Lions. This marks his sixth consecutive absence as he's dealing with a nagging foot injury. Chicago has been cautious with Odunze's recovery with the hope he'll return for the playoffs.

WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (Cardinals)

The NFC’s road to Super Bowl LX will go through Seattle for the first time since 2014, after the Seahawks smothered the NFL’s hottest offense in a 13-3 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in a pivotal regular-season finale at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

With the win, the Seahawks (14-3) secured the conference’s No. 1 seed, the lone first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, as well as their first NFC West title since 2020. Seattle also set a franchise record with 14 regular-season wins and improved to 15-2 on the road during coach Mike Macdonald’s two-year tenure.

With one day left in the NFL regular season, 12 of the 14 seeds in the postseason bracket remain undecided.

Nary a seed in the AFC has been solidified, including the No. 1 spot and the first-round bye that comes with it. That seed will go to either the Denver Broncos, New England Patriots or Jacksonville Jaguars, with the Jags the lone team that could land anywhere from No. 1 to No. 7 in the AFC.

The top seed in the NFC was finally decided Saturday night with the Seattle Seahawks’ win over the San Francisco 49ers in the Bay Area, but there’s plenty more to be determined in that conference, too. In fact, things are so absurd in the NFC South that a game between teams guaranteed to miss the playoffs will now determine whether the Carolina Panthers (8-9) or Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-9) represent the division with the NFC’s No. 4 seed.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/yV9GFZvpFmam_OLHYfCTW4WQt_1440x960.jpg",N,,2026-01-04 04:58:16.315184

A game that was already going to be an uphill climb for San Francisco will now be a little tougher.","The San Francisco 49ers got some brutal injury news 90 minutes before their Week 18 showdown with the Seattle Seahawks.

Left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall were both ruled out after being listed as questionable on the injury report. Williams is dealing with a hamstring injury while Pearsall continues to battle knee and ankle issues.

It isn't a huge surprise that Williams is out. He hurt his hamstring on the team's first snap against the Chicago Bears in Week 17. On a short week it always appeared unlikely the 37-year-old would be able to suit up Saturday. He was also a non-participant in practice throughout the week.

It is a bit of a surprise Pearsall is out since he played well while battling the injuries in Week 17 with five catches for 85 yards. Then he was limited throughout the week in practice. This will be his 14th missed game in two seasons.

Here are the 49ers inactive players for Week 18:

LT Trent Williams (hamstring)

WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle)

RB Isaac Guerendo

DE Robert Beal Jr.

DT Kevin Givens

LB Curtis Robinson

CB Chase Lucas

In a bit of good news, George Kittle is off the injury report and will play after missing Week 17 with an ankle injury. That's a great sign for San Francisco given how important Kittle is for both their pass and run games. He was listed as questionable on the injury report.

Defensive end Keion White and cornerback Upton Stout are also good to go after showing up as questionable on the injury report. White has a groin issue he's dealing with and Stout needed to clear concussion protocol before suiting up Saturday.

Missing Pearsall and Williams is tough for the 49ers while facing one of the best defenses in the NFL. Pearsall opens things up in their passing game with his ability to stretch the field vertically and get open in the middle of the field. Williams' absence wasn't felt much against Chicago, but having him out against Seattle will almost assuredly lead to some negative plays.

A game that was already going to be an uphill climb for San Francisco will now be a little tougher.","https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/20/SNIN/87853783007-usatsi-27817745.jpg?crop=4072,2291,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-04 04:58:19.377214

Williams' absence was expected after he didn't practice all week because of a right hamstring injury. Pearsall's was a bit more surprising because he was a limited participant in practice each day despite right knee and ankle injuries.

Tight end George Kittle (left ankle), defensive lineman Keion White (groin) and cornerback Upton Stout (concussion) were active after being listed as questionable.

Without Williams, the Niners turned to Austen Pleasants as the starter at left tackle. It was Pleasants' first start since entering the NFL as an undrafted free agent in 2020.

The Niners were held to 173 yards and nine first downs, while quarterback Brock Purdy passed for only 127 yards without a touchdown and also was intercepted and sacked three times against the Seahawks, who claimed the NFC West division crown, the No. 1 seed in the NFC, home-field advantage throughout the playoffs and a first-round bye.

On Thursday, Niners coach Kyle Shanahan said the team needed to be smart with Williams, acknowledging the importance of beating Seattle but also recognizing that it's not an elimination game and Williams will be needed at full strength for the postseason.

""It needs to be possible based off the doctors, and then it's got to be more on what Trent tells me,"" Shanahan said. ""I definitely don't want to lose any players for the following week knowing we're in the playoffs, but I also look at when you're playing to play one less playoff game, you can look at that as a playoff game. I know the season's not over if we lose, but you've still got to go play a game the next week on the road if you lose. And you can completely avoid that by winning. So, I see this as a playoff game too. I don't look at is as maybe that you'd lose him, you won't have him next week.""

Pearsall's situation has remained tenuous since he returned from a right knee injury in Week 11.

As expected, the Eagles are going to rest a notable amount of players, including the star quarterback, Jalen Hurts.

With the playoffs around the corner, and the Eagles guaranteed a spot in the Wild Card round, they have to be wise with their health. A player missing Sunday’s action might not be a bad scenario, but the Eagles still have a handful of players that are carrying some level of concern.

The 6 Eagles to Keep an Eye On

During Friday’s practice session, the Eagles missed six players. Each of them plays a key role for the team on Sundays.

Advertisement

1. Marcus Epps

The latest to land on the injury report. Marcus Epps is battling a concussion after reporting symptoms on Thursday. His status for next week’s game will depend on whether he can clear the protocol.

2. Jalen Carter

This season, Carter has battled health issues. He just returned from a multi-week absence last Sunday, and his impact was immediately felt. The good news is that Carter’s latest issue isn’t related to his most concerning setback of the season. He was unlikely to play on Sunday—injury or not.

3. Nakobe Dean

The Eagles didn’t have Dean in the picture until Week 7 this season. When they played the Commanders two weeks ago, he left after seeing the field for just 24 percent of the defensive snaps. He needs all of the rest and recovery he can get.

4. Lane Johnson

It’s been well over a month since Lane Johnson has taken the field. He is dealing with a foot injury, but returned to practice last week. However, Johnson hasn’t returned for game action and is now looking at the Wild Card round as his potential return to the field.

5. Dallas Goedert

The veteran tight end is dealing with a knee-related setback. All season long, Goedert has been consistent for the struggling Eagles offense. He was a rest candidate anyway. Goedert finishes the year with 60 catches for 591 yards and 11 touchdowns, marking a career high.

6. Jaelan Phillips

One of the top trade deadline pickups in the league this year, Phillips has been a major addition to the Eagles. He had an injury scare during last week’s outing in Buffalo. Phillips hasn’t practiced as he recovers from a minor ankle-related setback. His status moving forward is unclear.
