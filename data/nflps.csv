A conspiracy theory is floating around the NFL and surrounding the San Francisco 49ers, linking their home location, Levi's Stadium, to a number of injuries sustained by Niners players.

Just next door to Levi's Stadium, where the 49ers play their home games in Santa Clara, is their practice facility, which is where the 49ers have strapped up for practice since 1988. And, neighboring that venue sits an electrical substation.

What started as a theory has since gone viral, sparking social media debate about the safety of 49ers players and teams who visit Levi's Stadium for away games. Not to mention, Levi's Stadium will be the site of Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8.

The theory, which has yet to be scientifically proven true, is that excessive Electromagnetic Field (EMF) exposure can cause negative harm to the body.

""Low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage at levels regulators call 'safe',"" an X user, Peter Cowan, posted on Jan. 6 which has since amassed 22 million views, 5,900 reposts and 35,000 likes.

49ers injury conspiracy: NFL players react

San Francisco has suffered blows to many key players throughout the season, including Brock Purdy, Christian McCaffrey, Nick Bosa, Brandon Aiyuk, Trent Williams and Fred Warner. Many of their injuries were tendon and ligament tears.

George Kittle is the most recent victim to injury, after suffering a torn right Achilles against the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Wild Card Round at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia on Jan. 11.

49ers wide receiver Kendrick Bourne joked about the viral conspiracy theory explaining the team's injuries during a Jan. 13 scrum with reporters.

""Yeah, it's that power plant,"" Bourne said. ""Nah, I'm just playing. I don't know. It just sucks, but we do a good job of just working everyday. Injuries are a part of the game. It's unfortunate but we just have to hold it down keep that good energy and believe in ourselves, believe in the next man up.""

Although, there hasn't been an official injury tied to the EMF plant, players around the league are allegedly taking caution and reaching out to their agents about any possibility that there's truth to the conspiracy, according to the Washington Post.

Experts debunk 'nonsense' theory

Frank de Vocht, a professor of epidemiology and public health at Bristol Medical School in England, is a leading expert on how EMF affects humans.

He said in an interview with The Post that the conspiracy theory is ""nonsense"".

UC Davis radiology professor Jerrold Bushberg, who is also a 49ers fan, told Front Office Sports in an interview that there isn't any established evidence to conclude the conspiracy as accurate.

“These so-called ‘mechanisms’ have not been established,"" Bushberg said. ""Many of the experiments are contradictory. Many of the experiments have exposures that either don’t relate specifically to 50-, 60-hertz magnetic fields, or are at much, much higher levels than what would be experienced at a practice level.""

It's a topic that will likely resurface if there are any major injuries during Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara.

While conspiracy fans maintain their belief that there's truth to their theory, scientists are calling cap.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/17/USAT/88234716007-usatsi-27986055-168420867-lowres.jpg?crop=1984,1116,x0,y103&width=1984&height=1116&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-17 19:59:53.729572

The Current reported for preseason this week with the two-time NWSL MVP inactive on the roster and listed on the Season-Ending Injury list.
The Malawi international missed the final match of the regular season and the top-seed Current’s 2-1 loss to No.
“It’s hard because of the nature of the injury,” Armas said.
“I know it was a little bit of a tough ending here after, honestly, an amazing historic season,” Armas said.","The return of Kansas City Current forward Temwa Chawinga is “still unclear,” head coach Chris Armas told The Athletic.

The Current reported for preseason this week with the two-time NWSL MVP inactive on the roster and listed on the Season-Ending Injury list. Chawinga suffered an adductor injury in the first half of a 1-0 defeat away to the Houston Dash on Oct. 18; it was the Current’s penultimate match of the 2025 NWSL regular season.

The Malawi international missed the final match of the regular season and the top-seed Current’s 2-1 loss to No. 8-seed NJ/NY Gotham FC in the quarterfinals of the playoffs. Chawinga finished the season as the league’s Golden Boot winner with 15 goals, was crowned MVP and named in the Best XI.

“It’s hard because of the nature of the injury,” Armas said. “With Temwa, we’ve got to be very careful, but she’s looking great and doing lots of good work on the return to play.”

Chawinga is not the only high-profile Current forward who needs more time for recovery this preseason. Michelle Cooper has also been placed on the SEI list.

Cooper had a career-best year in 2025, scoring six goals and notching three assists, while also breaking into the U.S. women’s national team for the first time and earning 10 caps under Emma Hayes.

The 23-year-old winger injured her foot in the second half of the Current’s 2-1 win over the San Diego Wave on Nov. 2, the final day of the 2025 regular season, and also missed the playoffs.

The Current players are due to start training Saturday. Kansas City will open the 2026 season at home against the Utah Royals on March 14, which will be 147 days since Chawinga first picked up an injury.

“We might start the season without them, and this is tricky. We’ll know more in the next (few) weeks,” Armas said.

NWSL competition rules state a player can be designated as SEI only after a chief medical officer or team physician has performed an in-person injury assessment and then writes a letter to the league certifying the player’s designation.

Using the SEI designation allows teams to have salary-cap relief until the return of the player, as well as sign injury-replacement players.

Players can be activated off the SEI list at any time with clearance from a physician so long as they were designated as SEI in the prior season or before the start of the regular season.

A player designated as SEI after the start of the regular season can be activated to the roster but only if the team did not take roster or salary-cap relief. This is known in the competition rules as an “unexpected recovery” and can be used with a maximum of two players per team.

“I know it was a little bit of a tough ending here after, honestly, an amazing historic season,” Armas said. “Without the speed up top and some of our best players, we will find solutions from the start of the season. Hopefully they are back as soon as possible, but it’s still unclear.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/06/24230908/USATSI_26024379.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-17 20:00:00.729970

How does an oblique injury affect QBs?","Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold was declared active 90 minutes before the team’s divisional round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday, after being listed as questionable to play Thursday.

Despite the listing, the veteran QB was not seen warming up on the field with the Seahawks as of 3:30 p.m. PT. Instead, backup quarterback Drew Lock threw to the starters during on-field pregame warmups, while emergency quarterback Jalen Milroe threw to the backups.

Darnold was first listed as questionable with an oblique injury after Thursday’s practice, when he told reporters he “felt something” in his left side while throwing during practice and was removed from the session out of caution.

Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald said Friday that he was “really optimistic” Darnold would play, but the Seahawks haven’t had an official practice since Darnold’s injury. There was a light walk-through on Friday that was closed to reporters.

Macdonald declined to say whether Darnold, who was seen throwing underhand to Lock while Macdonald met the media on Friday, threw passes during the session. While he echoed Darnold’s comment that the injury designation and subsequent missed practice were measures taken out of caution, Macdonald said it’s possible the oblique injury could limit Darnold against San Francisco.

“Right now, we’re going through all the protocols out of caution, making sure we are ready to go,” Macdonald said.

Darnold, who has thrown for 4,048 yards and 25 touchdowns for the NFC’s No. 1-seeded Seahawks, hasn’t missed a game in either of the last two seasons.

“Right now, he’s confident he’s gonna be able to go do his thing 100 percent. We are, too,” Macdonald said Friday. He later added: “I don’t think we’d put him out there if he couldn’t do his job.”

Who is Seattle’s backup QB?

If Darnold doesn’t play, Lock, a 2019 second-round pick out of Missouri by the Denver Broncos, has taken first-team reps in Darnold’s place in preparation for the possibility of leading the Seahawks in their home playoff game.

Lock has thrown for 6,369 yards, 34 touchdowns and 28 interceptions in 41 games played in six NFL seasons.

His last start came with the New York Giants during the 2024 season, when he started five games and went 1-4 with 1,071 yards, six touchdowns and five interceptions on 59.1 percent passing.

He had a previous stint with the Seahawks after being traded to Seattle in March 2022 as part of the Russell Wilson deal with the Broncos. Lock was 1-1 in two starts for the Seahawks in 2023, including a 20-17 win over the Philadelphia Eagles that saw him complete 22 of 33 passes for 208 yards and a touchdown.

Who is the emergency third quarterback?

Should Darnold and Lock be unable to play, rookie Jalen Milroe can enter the game as an emergency third quarterback. He was listed by the team as its emergency quarterback 90 minutes before the game.

Since 2023, NFL teams have been allowed to dress a third QB on game days without using an active roster spot, but there are limitations.

The rule states that teams can activate that QB “during the game, if the club’s first two quarterbacks on its game day Active List are not able to participate in the game due to injury or disqualification.” Milroe cannot be activated due to a head coach’s decision based on performance or conduct. If either of the first two quarterbacks is cleared by medical staff to play after the emergency QB enters the game, he must be removed immediately.

The Seahawks drafted Milroe out of Alabama in the third round of the 2025 NFL Draft. In college, Milroe tallied 6,016 passing yards, throwing 45 touchdowns and 20 interceptions. On the ground, he ran for 1,577 yards and 33 touchdowns.

How does an oblique injury affect QBs?

Dr. Jeremy Alland, a sports medicine primary care physician who served as a team physician for the Chicago Bulls and Chicago White Sox, wrote earlier this season about how oblique injuries can affect quarterbacks.

Addressing the topic after Cleveland Browns QB Shedeur Saunders suffered such an injury during training camp in August, Alland wrote that the oblique muscles “are crucial for core stability and rotational power. In quarterbacks, these muscles generate much of the torque needed for deep, accurate passes.”

He added: “An oblique strain typically occurs when these muscles are overstretched or overloaded, often during high-velocity rotational movements like throwing.”

The doctor mentioned three possibilities for how such an injury might occur: during a powerful throw with torso rotation, during off-balance throws or during repetitive high-intensity passing without proper recovery. He listed potential symptoms such as sharp pain in the side or lower ribs during rotation, discomfort with laughing, deep breathing or coughing.

Mild strains can take up to two to three weeks to recover from, according to Alland. If Darnold’s initial strain occurred on Thursday, then he would be attempting to play on just two days of recovery.

“Quarterbacks often require full rotational strength and pain-free mechanics before returning to play,” Alland wrote, “as incomplete healing can significantly increase re-injury risk.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/17124042/GettyImages-2254536822.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-17 19:01:50.087606

Q2 0:32 - Bills 10, Broncos 10

This drive has been very disjointed thanks to injuries and timeouts but Denver is still rolling.

Marvin Mims Jr. has been critical on third down as Bo Nix finds him for 15 yards before Sean Payton calls his final timeout.

Buffalo has been scraping the bottom of its safety depth chart, and now Cam Lewis has gone to the locker room with 38 seconds left and Denver still working. Lewis appeared to suffer a cramp, as trainers tended to him with hydration and stretches. But if this issue persists, the short-handed Bills are even weaker at safety.

Q2 0:38 - Bills 10, Broncos 10

After a timeout by Buffalo, Bo Nix is unable to connect with Courtland Sutton on second-and-10. Cam Lewis, who is having a strong afternoon, came flying in to break up the pass but he was injured on the play.

That could be a big problem for the Bills as injuries continue to mount in this game.

Q2 1:04 - Bills 10, Broncos 10

Bo Nix finds Marvin Mims Jr. for a short gain on third-and-3 to move the sticks.

Two plays later, Denver faces third-and-3 again at midfield. Nix takes matters into his own hands, taking off for 6 yards into Buffalo territory to extend the drive.

Bills center Connor McGovern has been cleared to return, which is great news for them. Josh Allen was pressured a lot on the Bills' last possession, and Anderson rolled a shotgun snap back to him on a play that resulted in a 0-yard sack.

Q2 1:55 - Bills 10, Broncos 10

Courtland Sutton sat down wide open but Bo Nix misses him on the run. He then connects with Evan Engram for 7 yards as this game reaches the two-minute warning. Denver will have third-and-3 after the break.

Buffalo will begin the second half with the football.

And there's a Keon Coleman drop in the end zone. The touchdown wouldn't have counted, but if Coleman catches that pass, then the Broncos would have been forced to accept O'Cyrus Torrence's false start penalty. Instead, the Broncos decline, and rather than the Bills getting another third-down situation to score a TD or gain 14 yards for a first down, they kick the field goal to tie the game at 10.

Q2 2:13 - Bills 10, Broncos 10

Josh Allen is sacked again, setting up third-and-9. He targets Keon Coleman open in the back of the end zone but the wideout drops a touchdown. Luckily for him, it would have been negated by an offensive holding penalty anyway.

Buffalo settles for a 33-yard field goal from Matt Prater and he drills it to tie the game.

Q2 4:37 - Broncos 10, Bills 7

A sack of Josh Allen on first down slows down Buffalo's momentum. A screen to Khalil Shakir then sets up third-and-10. Allen delivers though, throwing a perfect ball to Brandin Cooks for a gain of 15 yards into the red zone.

The veteran wideout has been huge for Buffalo in the playoffs.

Frank Crum is a second-year undrafted player from Wyoming. He has played sparingly in his first two years in the NFL, finding a role this season as Denver's sixth O-lineman in heavy sets. He know has Denver's first touchdown of their divisional round matchup against the Bills. Just as we all thought

Bills running back James Cook never fumbled through his first eight playoff games. That streak just ended in his ninth appearance, and not only did Cook fumble, he lost that fumble, marking the first playoff turnover of his career.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/oO9eY86CceJQ_W1Icaxgikimt_1440x960.jpg",N,,2026-01-17 17:59:21.172416

Buffalo (+1.5) at Denver, o/u 46.0 – Saturday, 4:30 p.m. EST

The AFC side of the playoffs this season could end up being something of a referendum on just how important it is to have a truly elite quarterback. Josh Allen quite literally carried the Bills to a win over the Jaguars in the wild-card round, and with Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson sitting at home, Drake Maye might be the only signal-caller left in the field who can match him in talent. Of course, the team around him needs to help a bit too. James Cook got stifled by the Jags, and the Broncos haven't been much easier to run against, but he might be overdue for a trip to the end zone — his last TD came in Week 16. Allen still lacks a true WR1, but Khalil Shakir is at least a reliable possession option, and Dalton Kincaid can create some mismatches at tight end. If Ed Oliver is able to make it back this weekend, it would also go a long way toward shoring up the defense's biggest weakness, as three of the team's last five opponents have run for more than 150 yards against the Bills.

The Broncos hopefully used their bye to figure out a way to spark their offense. In three games since starting center Luke Wattenberg was injured, they haven't topped 20 points, though they still won two of them thanks to the defense. Since a Week 12 bye, Denver's allowed 19.8 points per game with 19 sacks, and on the year Nik Bonitto and company led the NFL in sacks, pressures and QB knockdowns. No defense gave up fewer TDs in 2025 — the Seahawks tied the Broncos with 29 allowed, but they also coughed up a couple on special teams and offense — or had a better red-zone efficiency, and only Seattle had a better third-down efficiency. If DC Vance Joseph's crew can keep Allen from steamrolling them close to the goal line, it'll give Bo Nix a chance to get them through to the organization's first AFC championship since 2015, but that's far easier said than done.

San Francisco (+7.5) at Seattle, o/u 45.0 – Saturday, 8 p.m. EST

What's that old tag line? ""Takes a licking and keeps on ticking""? The 49ers had to pull Eric Kendricks off his couch to play linebacker a few weeks ago and lost George Kittle in the wild-card round, but that didn't stop them from going on the road and upsetting the defending champs in Philly. Christian McCaffrey keeps rolling right along, catching two TD passes against the Eagles while racking up triple-digit scrimmage yards for the third time in the last four games, and his steadiness has kept the offense afloat even though Brock Purdy has managed to get picked off in four consecutive games. DC Robert Saleh keeps MacGyvering a defense with paper clips and chewing gum, but the unit's failed to produce a turnover in four of its last five games, and the run defense has been gashed pretty regularly down the stretch. Fate is always on a team's side until destiny yanks the rug out from under it, and it's probably not a great sign that the only loss the Niners have had the last two months has come against the team they're facing Saturday, but San Francisco also knows that it's playing with house money at this point. The pressure's all on the other sideline.

The NFC's No. 1 seed didn't seem worried the last time these two teams met, though. With that first-round bye on the line, the Seahawks completely shut down the Niners, winning 13-3 in Week 18. It was the fourth time in its last six games that Mike Macdonald's defense had held an opponent to 10 points or fewer, and during the team's active seven-game winning streak Seattle's allowed just 14.1 points and 263.6 yards a contest. Zach Charbonnet's gotten into the end zone four times in the team's last three games, and Jaxon Smith-Njigba wrapped up his breakout campaign with the eighth-highest receiving yards total in history. Assuming Sam Darnold's minor oblique issue is, in fact, minor, the only thing working against the Seahawks is their lack of pedigree. Darnold's first playoff game last year didn't go so well, and while Macdonald was on Baltimore's staff, the Ravens went 3-6 in the postseason and never got past the conference championship (though I guess that track record is more the Giants' problem now than the Seahawks').

SUNDAY

Houston (+3) at New England, o/u 40.5 – Sunday, 3 p.m. EST

Three teams had a claim to being a truly elite defense in 2025, and all three are still alive in the playoffs. The Texans were the only ones to have to survive the wild-card round, though, and they likely sent Aaron Rodgers into retirement with an emphatic 30-6 victory that included two defensive TDs. They might need the extra scoring again this weekend, and C.J. Stroud's top target, Nico Collins, isn't expected to clear the concussion protocol in time. During Houston's 10-game winning streak, DeMeco Ryans' defense has given up an average of 18.0 points and 274.9 yards a game, so Stroud might not need too much extra help. The third-year QB has a 9:3 TD:INT in the last six weeks, with the most surprising of those nine being the one that went to Christian Kirk last week. The veteran slot receiver was basically an afterthought in the offense the entire second half, but he erupted for 8-144-1 against Pittsburgh, seamlessly stepping in for Collins. Kirk won't be a surprise this time around, but the Texans would probably take half of that production.

The Patriots had their worst offensive performance since Week 3 in the wild-card round, but fortunately at the same time they put together their best defensive performance of the year, holding the Chargers to just a field goal and sacking poor Justin Herbert six times. Drake Maye did commit multiple turnovers for only the fourth time this season and failed to complete 60 percent of his passes for the first time since Week 10, but the MVP voting is already done so he should be fine. He did face the Texans in his first career start last year, tossing three TDs but committing three turnovers in a 41-21 loss, but both the QB and the Houston defense are in very different places now. (Fun fact: Stefon Diggs caught his last TD as a Texan in that game.) Mike Vrabel is favoring Rhamondre Stevenson again over TreVeyon Henderson, with the senior RB scoring six TDs in the last four games while piling up 461 scrimmage yards, but the pattern for this offense as a whole has been that there is no pattern beyond Maye's involvement, so bank on that at your peril.

L.A. Rams at Chicago (+3.5), o/u 48.5 – Sunday, 6:30 p.m. EST

In what is perhaps the most improbable factoid I've ever seen, Sean McVay will roll into his 15th career playoff game never having faced a time twice. Under his watch, the only NFC teams the Rams haven't met yet in the postseason are the Giants and Commanders. If the Rams don't advance here, expect both of them to get playoff berths in 2026, just so McVay can complete his list. Or he might just say to heck with it and go all the way to the Super Bowl, which would be fun too. Last weekend's win over the Panthers required a last-minute TD from Colby Parkinson, but that was mainly because the defense couldn't contain Bryce Young. Matthew Stafford led the team to 30-plus points for the fifth time in the last six games, a stretch in which the Rams averaged 36.3 points and 466.5 yards while the veteran QB posted a 17:5 TD:INT. For all the focus that goes toward Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, it's the team's stacked TE room that's been doing serious damage. Parkinson, Tyler Higbee and Terrance Ferguson combined for nine of those 17 touchdowns while playing only 12 games between them, which is some Brock Bowers-Trey McBride level production. The NFL is a copycat league, and while the trend the last few years has seen a resurgence from bell cow RBs, it's stud TEs creating mismatches that might be the next big thing through the rest of the decade.

The Bears probably looked at the Rams' little comeback last weekend and laughed, while riffing on Bane's speech but talking about how those rich playboys from L.A. merely adopted the fourth-quarter deficit. Caleb Williams led his team back from a 21-6 deficit at the start of the fourth quarter, after he put together six other fourth-quarter comebacks during the regular season — tied for the fifth-highest total in history. The list of QB with six or more in a season includes Hall of Famers like John Elway and Payton Manning (twice!) ... and Stafford, who had a record eight 4Q comebacks with the Lions in 2016 as they went 9-7. (Which, like, how is that even possible?) At some point Ben Johnson's going to have to figure out how to get his young gunslinger to flip that switch a little earlier in the game, but Williams has plenty of time to work things out. The Chicago defense sagged late in the season and has allowed more than 400 yards in three consecutive games, but so long as Williams gets the ball last, there's nothing to worry about.

How much will the Seahawks’ top-ranked defense make the quarterback’s new oblique issue a secondary concern that won’t get in Seattle’s way of advancing to the NFC championship game next week?

Those have become the key questions in the final 48 hours up to the divisional-playoff game between the top-seeded Seahawks (14-3) and sixth-seeded San Francisco 49ers (13-5) Saturday at Lumen Field (5 p.m., FOX television, channel 13 locally).

Darnold is questionable to play. The Pro Bowl quarterback who threw for over 4,000 yards this season with 25 touchdowns and an NFL-high 20 turnovers felt discomfort in his left oblique, his non-throwing side, throwing a pass in practice Thursday.

Coach Mike Macdonald on Friday echoed his QB from the day before in saying he is “really optimistic” Darnold will play.

But how will the injury affect him throwing the ball, his follow-through on passes, and taking hits and sacks?

No one — not Darnold, not his coach or the team’s medical staff — will know that exactly until it happens Saturday. The Seahawks’ coaches and training staff will have Darnold test the oblique throwing in pregame drills, but...

Macdonald was asked Friday if he expects Darnold to be limited at all by the injury, in throwing the ball or any of his other normal QB duties in the game.

“Well, yeah, that’s a possibility,” Macdonald said. “But I don’t think — I think right now, he’s confident that he’s going to be able to go do his thing 100%. We are, too.

“But these things, something could change between now and then or something could happen in-game. So we just kind of have to roll with it.

“I mean, I don’t think that we’d put him out there if he couldn’t do his job. He’s going to be able to go do his job (in order to play).”

Darnold injured his oblique on his left, non-throwing side during practice Thursday, throwing a pass without defenders. He said he felt discomfort in his side and immediately shut down practicing to get treatment for the rest of the day.

Veteran backup Drew Lock was the quarterback for the starting offense the rest of practice two days before the playoff opener.

The list of inactive players announced by each time 90 minutes before kickoff, 3:30 p.m. Saturday, will be the first indication whether Darnold, or Lock, is playing.

But it won’t be the last Darnold’s oblique issue comes up Saturday, playing (as all indications are he will) or not playing.

2nd key: Byron Murphy

George Kittle is out for San Francisco. The All-Pro tight end tore his Achilles tendon last weekend in the 49ers wild-card playoff win at Philadelphia. That makes Christian McCaffrey even more vital for the Niners — and for the Seahawks to stop. Again.

In the NFC West title game two weeks ago, Seahawks do-it-all rookie Nick Emmanwori tackled McCaffrey multiple times immediately after catches. The All-Pro rushing and receiving running back had six reception but for just 34 yards. That was his fewest yards receiving with that many catches and without a score in two seasons, since Christmas 2025 against Baltimore — whose defensive coordinator that night was...Macdonald.

Enter Byron Murphy.

On Jan. 3 the Seahawks’ dynamic, yet under-the-radar defensive tackle splitting double-teams allowed Ernest Jones, Leonard Williams and DeMarcus Lawrence to tackle McCaffrey at the line on running plays. McCaffrey’s 23 yards on eight carries was his lowest run-game production since December 2018, his second NFL season with Carolina.

With Kittle out, expect 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan to use McCaffrey in different formations, perhaps out wide, and more often in a varied passing scheme. And the Seahawks expect more than the eight carries McCaffrey got against them two weeks ago. Macdonald calls Murphy, Seattle’s first-round draft choice out of Texas in 2024, “the best in the world right now, especially at A-gap (between the guard and center) double-teams.”

If Murphy is again as brilliant, strong and quick in beating double-team blocks with his unique move of going to one knee and rising through like he’s doing a Turkish-kettle-bell get-up works as it did the last time against the 49ers, the Seahawks will be in the NFC championship game.

3rd key: 49ers vs Seattle’s run

Darnold’s injury could mean even more of a reliance on the running game than Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak’s had while calling runs on 50% of plays this regular season, when the Seahawks were among the NFL’s top-three run-heavy offenses.

Even if Darnold feels great, they will run.

Kenneth Walker, Zach Charbonnet and the Seahawks romped for a season-high 180 yards on the ground in Santa Clara Jan. 3. The 49ers played two-deep safety defense for the majority of snaps in the first half — when Seattle rushed for 115 yards, its most in an opening half in two seasons. Then San Francisco went to single-high safety looks, with a “heavier box” and second safety nearer the line of scrimmage to stop the run. Yet on Seattle’s biggest offensive play after halftime, Walker ran for 19 yards on third and 17 against two-deep defense.

Seahawks rookie guard Grey Zabel this week said he expects Niners defensive play caller Robert Saleh to run blitz more, mix fronts more, and give Seattle’s offense new looks to combat the run. If they don’t work a lot better than what the 49ers did the last time they played Seattle and got run over, it may be the same end result.

The pick

The Seahawks’ defense is elite enough to get the team to their first Super Bowl in 11 seasons. Darnold and the offense must do their part not to subvert that. That means not turning the ball over and handing points to the depleted 49ers, who again will find driving 70-plus yards for points on Seattle a monumental task.

Darnold takes care of the ball — and his aching side.

And the Seahawks advance to play the Rams in the NFC title game next week at Lumen Field.

Read on for the NFL Divisional Round Talking Points!

MVP BOLTER’S ‘SERIOUS’ OBSTACLE IN BIGGEST LITMUS TEST

In just his second season since being taken no. 3 overall by the Patriots, Drake Maye has elevated himself into the Most Valuable Player conversation, and justifiably so.

He’s thrown the deep ball accurately all season long and looked every bit the franchise quarterback the front office hoped he’d be when it swooped on the former North Carolina standout.

But after the Patriots’ defence suffocated Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers in the wildcard, Maye faces the toughest test of his young career on Monday.

That’s because the Houston Texans are the NFL’s unmatched defensive force.

The Texans finished the regular season ranked first in the league in total defence, and second in scoring defence — their 17.4 points allowed per game was just behind Seattle’s top-ranked 17.2 — led by elite pass-rushing duo Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter, and ball-hawking cornerback combo Derek Stingley Jr. and Kamari Lassiter.

In their wildcard round triumph over Aaron Rodgers’ Steelers, the Texans scored two defensive touchdowns. Powered by head coach DeMeco Ryans, this is a serious unit.

So, ball security is going to be of utmost priority for Maye, who isn’t immune to the odd fumble when there’s pressure in the pocket.

The 23-year-old will have to prove the credentials that have put him in MVP contention, and using his feet to escape the grasp of Anderson and Hunter will be one of the biggest keys.

It comes after Maye struggled to genuinely assert himself against the Chargers, going 17-29 passing for 268 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He did, however, carry it 10 times for a team-best 66 rushing yards.

Maye had the league’s best passer rating — 112.0 — in the regular season, but the Texans allowed the NFL’s second-lowest opposing passer rating of 83.2.

Asked how the Patriots can score on the Texans’ defence, renowned sportscaster Bill Simmons said on his podcast: “Drake Maye. We’ve seen the Texans get beaten by deep shots … because a lot of times they’re just rushing four, we saw (Aaron) Rodgers with opportunities to run, but he didn’t, because he’s old. Drake Maye will run. And I just think the Pats are way better than the Steelers.”

ESPN sportscaster Peter Schrager, on the other hand, wasn’t as optimistic about New England’s chances against the league’s best stoppers.

“I’ve seen the Texans’ defence up close twice this season … I am blown away by all three levels of this defence, that I am going to give you the biggest hyperbole of all — this might be like the 2000 Ravens.

“They might not need to do anything on offence, they might just win games 13-10, 16-13 … this defence is that good, they’re that fast, and I just don’t see how the Patriots score enough to beat them.

“The only way they lose to the Patriots … is that their quarterback holds them back, and their offence just isn’t good enough, and they just give the ball away.

“Because if they just protect the ball, I think you’re underestimating this defence in a serious way; I think it’s historically good.”

But it’s also going to be on New England’s defence — which finished the regular season with the fourth-best scoring defence — to make Houston signal-caller CJ Stroud uncomfortable.

Stroud fumbled five times and threw an interception in the win over Pittsburgh last week. He can be rattled, and on their home field, the Patriots’ defence will feed off the crowd.

CAN REVITALISED QB GET OVER PLAYOFF HUMP?

A penny for your thoughts Minnesota Vikings fans?

Ten months ago, you saw your franchise let QB Sam Darnold walk in free agency for nothing after he led the team to a 14-3 regular season record.

Darnold and the Vikings’ Super Bowl hopes fizzled out in the first week of the postseason. A couple of months later, Darnold was being introduced as the Seahawks’ new QB.

Of course, the reason Darnold got the chance to start in Minnesota was due to a season-ending injury to 2024 first round draft pick JJ McCarthy. Understandably, the Vikings put faith in the guy they drafted so high and let Darnold exit.

It’s a decision many Vikings fans disagreed with and seeing Darnold’s excellent form for the Seahawks this season, that hurt won’t go away until McCarthy can lead Minnesota back to the playoffs.

But, one team’s trash is another team’s treasure, and the Seahawks are reaping the rewards for adding Darnold in free agency.

Statistically, Darnold had a better 2024 season, but in both, he was able to lead his team to an impressive 14-3 mark.

It’s quite the achievement given his career was in limbo after the struggling Panthers didn’t renew his contract after the 2022 season.

In his first year as a Seahawk, Darnold threw for 4,048 yards and 25 touchdowns, establishing a terrific rapport with stud wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba.

There were a few nervous moments for Seahawks fans this week when Darnold was placed on the injury report for an oblique injury.

Despite the scare, Darnold will suit up for Seattle when this season’s NFC top seed takes on division rivals San Francisco.

Off a bye and with the 49ers losing another star player to injury in the Wild Card win over the Eagles, bookies are pretty confident the Seahawks will have too much firepower.

However, there’s still a duck that Darnold is yet to break, and it raises some concerns coming up against a 49ers side who boast plenty of playoff experience.

Darnold has yet to win a playoff game, while his counterpart Brock Purdy has won five.

Interestingly, it was the 49ers who revived Darnold’s career when they took a chance on him after an up-and-down stint in Carolina.

‘CARDS STACKED AGAINST’ BILLS AS QB URGED TO TURN INTO ‘FOOTBALL GOD’

It will be some sort of effort if the Buffalo Bills are able to go into Denver and eliminate the Broncos.

Many believe the Bills don’t have any excuses this season due to the sheer fact their playoff nemesis in recent years, the Kansas City Chiefs, aren’t around this postseason.

Other AFC powerhouses over the past few years in the Baltimore Ravens and the Cincinnati Bengals are also missing.

It leaves the playoff-hardened Bills up against several teams who haven’t had much recent success beyond the regular season.

However, while their usual foes might not be in their way of a maiden Super Bowl, it’s fair to say the Bills haven’t faced as much adversity as they have had to deal with this season.

Buffalo might be rueing the missed opportunity not to make a deal for Dolphins WR Jaylen Waddle at the trade deadline as their pass catching stocks are severely depleted.

Heading into the Denver clash on Sunday morning (AEDT), the Bills are down to just three healthy wide receivers against arguably the best defence in all of football.

We’ve seen QB Josh Allen turn into Superman and literally lift his team over the line more than once in the postseason, but given the mounting casualty ward, ESPN analyst and former Pro Bowl safety says the Bills signal maker might have to become a ‘Football God’.

“The cards are stacked against him. You’re playing against the No. 2 ranked defence with three wide receivers … You ain’t supposed to win … You’re playing against a roster that’s better than yours,” Clark exclaimed.

“This is the time where he gets to join the Montanas, the Bradys, the Mahomes’ as among the greatest that have ever played.

“It’s setting up for him to be everything that many people already believe that he could be.

“With the odds stacked against him, nobody is going to come in on Monday and say it’s his fault but if he wins, he is one step closer to immortality.”

CONCERNING RAMS REALITY IN BRUTAL WEATHER TWIST

After the incredible events that unfolded in the wildcard round, the Chicago Bears now have their sights set on a first NFC Championship Game appearance since 2011.

The Bears went in as home underdogs against the Packers last week, and they’re a four-and-a-half-point underdog this week as they prepare to host Matthew Stafford and the Rams.

But while Los Angeles will go into the game favoured, veteran quarterback Stafford historically doesn’t like playing outdoors in cold weather.

The 37-year-old, three weeks off turning 38, has only ever played home games in domed stadiums.

He played his first 12 seasons in Detroit, where the Lions play their home games in a roofed arena. He was traded to the Rams in 2021, where he’s played most games in the state-of-the-art, roofed SoFi Stadium.

But these are the numbers that really tell the story.

After last season’s divisional-round loss at the hands of Philadelphia, Stafford’s record in games where there is rain or snow slumped to 1-9.

Further, he has a 7-11 record when the temperature is below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 degrees Celsius).

Well, in less-than-ideal news for Stafford and Rams fans, the projected temperature in Chicago on Sunday night is 18 degrees Fahrenheit (-7.7 degrees Celsius), with a considerable chance of snowfall.

And in 12 career games at Chicago’s Soldier Field, Stafford has just five wins to his name, having thrown 16 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.

But Stafford, who also played several games at Green Bay’s freezing Lambeau Field while with the Lions, didn’t seem too disconcerted with the Chicago forecast this weekend.

“Yeah, I mean, I think each game is kind of unique, right? You can’t just bunch them all together,” Stafford said when asked about his cold-weather record.

“Played in Philly back in the day, there was six inches of snow on the ground. Played other games where it’s just cold and dry, you know? I mean, you’ve just got to go figure out what the elements are, how it’s going to affect the ball, (and) go play, you know?

“We had wind last week. What’s that like? How’s the ball moving when you throw it down the field? All those kinds of things. So, you just figure it out when you go.”

But even if the weather talk doesn’t make you question the Rams’ chances, they’ve got a defence that can be scored on.

You only have to look as far as their wildcard scare against the Carolina Panthers, who were considered big underdogs yet dropped 31 points on Sean McVay’s team, which has a strong pass-rush but a secondary that can be exploited.

Stafford’s late-game heroics proved the difference despite a sprained finger that cast doubt over his capabilities.

If Chicago’s Caleb Williams, DJ Moore, Colston Loveland and company can keep the good times rolling on offence — having scored 25 fourth-quarter points to devastate the Packers — the Bears could well be one win away from a Super Bowl berth this time next week.",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/7f2fc925d301a2d2f4a6fb2610194969,N,,2026-01-17 17:59:27.150326

Seahawks coach ‘really optimistic’ QB Sam Darnold will play vs. 49ers

“Seahawks QB Sam Darnold hasn’t thrown a football since he hurt his oblique Thursday,” Schefter wrote on social media. “The Seahawks believe, but don’t know, that he will be OK to start tonight’s game vs. the 49ers. Backup QB Drew Lock took the reps the past two days and is ready if needed.”

Schefter later added that Darnold is “going to play,” but that it’s hard to know how much, if any, he will be limited.”

Can Seahawks beat 49ers if Drew Lock is QB instead of Sam Darnold?

Schefter also detailed what he knew about Darnold’s status Saturday on ESPN’s Postseason NFL Countdown, which you can watch at this link.

NFL Network’s Steve Wyche shared his own report from Seattle’s Lumen Field on Saturday morning, and while he had similar information that he relayed from a Seahawks official, Wyche’s report seemed more encouraging overall on Darnold’s status that Schefter’s initial post.

“(The Seahawks official) said first off, when Darnold sustained this injury, he said it was something he had never felt before, so they were very cautious. They basically shut him down,” Wyche said. “But they said not only are they optimistic, but that Darnold himself feels super confident that he will be able to get out and play. Now they’re going to work him out before kickoff, but again, all signs are indicating that Sam Darnold will be good to go for the Seahawks.”

Darnold, who is a Pro Bowler for the second straight season, started all 17 games for the Seahawks as they finished 14-3 to win the NFC West and take the top seed from the NFC into the playoffs.

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold has not thrown a football since injuring his oblique Thursday, according to ESPN.

The report said the Seahawks believe Darnold will start Saturday's NFC divisional-round game against the San Francisco 49ers (8 p.m. ET, FOX) but were not certain. Backup Drew Lock took first-team reps since Darnold's injury, per ESPN.

Darnold is listed as questionable on the official injury report. He helped the Seahawks to a 14-3 record and the No. 1 seed in the NFC.

Speaking to reporters Thursday, Darnold said there was ""close to zero percent"" chance he would not play against San Francisco.

""Kind of just felt a little something on that oblique, just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said. ""Wasn't the day to push it so that was it. So I just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold finished the regular season with 25 touchdown passes, 14 interceptions and a 67.7 completion percentage while throwing for 4,048 yards. The matchup against the Niners would be his second playoff start and a chance for redemption after last year's calamitous wild-card performance as a member of the Minnesota Vikings against the Los Angeles Rams.

In 17 games, Darnold has completed 67.7% of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, earning his second straight Pro Bowl selection.

If Darnold cannot play against the 49ers, it would be a major blow. Lock has appeared in five games this season, throwing just three passes.

Lock started five games for the New York Giants last season, going 1-4 with a 59.1% completion percentage and throwing for 1,071 yards with six touchdowns and five interceptions. He has started 28 games in his career, going 10-18.

Yeah, no, I think the 49ers wouldn’t have progressed into doing these things if the bones, the ligaments, weren’t healed.
So the risk would more be, you know, number one, could there be another muscle injury and injury somewhere else?
It’s a structural injury; it’s not a pain tolerance issue.
It’s, it’s, it’s one of those things where you could say that, well, because the San Francisco 49ers team starts with an S and then they’re the most injured team that starts with an S. Is there actually a connection?","The story of the 2025 San Francisco 49ers is still being written. Saturday night, the 49ers will take on the Seattle Seahawks at Lumen Field with an NFC Championship game berth on the line. There is no two ways around it. This season will be remembered for the injuries to impactful players like Nick Bosa, Brock Purdy, George Kittle, Fred Warner, Mykel Williams, and a laundry list of others during the season.

Is there any rhyme or reason to the injuries? Is it simply bad luck? Does the team practice too hard? Is the training staff doing their job? With no clear answer to any of these questions, a new conspiracy theory about electrical substations near the practice facility has taken on a life of its own.

I had a chance to sit down with Dr. Nirav Pandya of 95.7 The Game to discuss the injuries to the players and whether there is any data suggesting the substation is contributing to the 49ers’ injuries and recovery time.

So let’s start with the obvious one, Fred Warner, who is not gonna play but was running around in practice.

Doc, tell me how surprised you are by his timeline because his ankle was facing the other way 90 days ago, against the Tampa Bay Bucs. How is this possible? Is there a hyperbolic chamber, or is this just somebody who is built a little bit differently?

Yeah, no, that’s a great question. You know, I think for a lot of people, you get to about, you know, around three months, we know pretty predictably.

The bone’s gonna be healed if there’s a ligament injury that’s gonna be healed. But how quickly athletes can get their strength, their mobility, how quickly that comes back, that varies a lot. So for most people who aren’t rehabbing, every day can be a year-long process. For a lot of athletes, it can be up to six months, but for whatever reason, just the type of athlete he is, the way he is been attacking his rehab, he’s definitely progressed, um, to where he is doing stuff out on the football field.

I would’ve expected when you saw that injury, probably more like four to five months. But clearly his body has responded really well, has been able to progress to this level. And now the real question is, is there enough time to get him ready for potentially a game next week? ‘Cause obviously now the reports are, he is not playing this weekend.

Now, the question that I think I have, and a lot of people have, is whether there is any sort of risk for further re-injury, or possibly something down the line that would complicate his future as a 49er? Like rushing back a little bit too early. Is it something that possibly he’s pushing himself a little too hard, I guess?

Yeah, no, I think the 49ers wouldn’t have progressed into doing these things if the bones, the ligaments, weren’t healed. Right. So I think there’s a pretty low likelihood that you can re-injure what was broken or injured before. The larger question is, is there any compensation that’s still there?

Is there still some muscle weakness thing that just takes time to get, you know, better? So the risk would more be, you know, number one, could there be another muscle injury and injury somewhere else? Just ‘cause he’s compensating, ‘cause he is not running the way that he does. Or number two, which is sometimes the more subtle thing, is you can run on the practice field, you can do all those drills, but can you have a 300-pound lineman land on it?

And I think that’s the question. It’s really hard to know because there’s no way to test that. You can’t have someone land on you in practice, be like, oh, it held up. So I think the two major considerations are is the muscle strength and flexibility there that he can be the Fred Warner, who he was.

How he was running and jumping before the injury? And then is it ready to withstand the contact that you need to play 70 80 plays in the intensity of a playoff game?

I’m picking the 49ers to move on to the NC Championship game. Do you expect him to be on some sort of snap count, or is this just, if he’s ready to go, he has to be able to play all the snaps?

I think there probably will be some sort of snap count. I mean, you take it just from a basic perspective. If you haven’t done physical activity in three to four months, even if you’re just like a regular athlete, right?

You just work out and things like that, and suddenly someone’s like, okay, now we’re gonna have you from like you’ve run a quarter mile, and now you’re gonna go run a marathon in five days. You know, like I think your body’s just not gonna perform at the level that you need, and you’re at risk for injury.

And I think the bigger consideration is that. You know, if he gets to play 70, play 80, you know, is he gonna be effective? Are there other players on the team? Because they’re more conditioned, who can be out there? So I think most likely there’ll be a restriction, but you know, honestly, a lot of it’s gonna be probably how he’s looking out there and what he’s telling the team.

Obviously, George Kittle’s devastating Achilles injury is concerning based on how late in the season it occurred and his age. What is his timeline, and when can we expect his explosiveness to return?

If you look at NFL players who have an Achilles even, and we’ll talk about Aaron Rodgers and Cam Akers, et cetera, you know, most people usually land nine to 12 months after surgery. Like, you know, you’re basically sewing the tendon together, and then you’re basically trying to get back your speed and explosiveness, so that takes a long time, especially for a football player.

The good news for Kittle is that if you look at the position that actually returns to play the best, it’s tight ends. U For me, my theory is that tight ends are probably some of the best athletes, and the better athlete you are before your injury, the more likely you’re gonna be able to kind of get back.

If he does get back, and there’s a high likelihood you will see that drop in the first season, but then in the second season, you see the statistics kind of climb back up. Now the key factor is obviously age. And you know, if you’re 22 or 23 and you tear your Achilles, the quality of that tissue theoretically is gonna be better than someone a little bit older.

Also, your body’s ability to respond to this big injury is a lot better, but with some of the newer techniques, where they’re basically fixing it, using smaller incisions and using things that are a little bit stronger. You can actually start doing the rehab a lot earlier, and that’s where you’re starting to see some players push the envelope of, hey, maybe month six.

Assuming he’s got a regular, you know, standard Achilles. Probably around nine months. So I think the possibility of him playing next year, barring some sort of crazy setbacks, is pretty high.

Now, that’s the easy way to pivot into Ricky Pearsall, who is dealing with a PCL injury. This is the second one. And there is this sentiment out there that Ricky should be pushing through this injury. Is it a matter of toughness? Doc, I’m not a doctor myself, but from the information that I’ve gathered about PCL injuries, it’s about stability, and it’s about him being able to push off, and it’s about him being able to break in and out of routes.

Is that really what’s going on? Or is this something where he can’t just say, Hey, listen, I’m gonna push through this if his knee can just give out at any time because of the ligament itself?

Yeah, no, absolutely. I think that, you know, the 49ers keep saying this is a PCL injury. They’re not saying it’s knee inflammation, they’re not saying other stuff.

The PCL basically gives you stability to your knee, and if you don’t have a good PCL, imagine your shin bone just shifting back relative to your thigh bone. So you know, someone can’t will themselves to basically, oh, I’m gonna look really push through my knee being unstable. It’s hard to even wear a brace when you’re playing at that level.

Now, for a lineman, maybe they can push through it, but you have to cut, you have to pivot, you have to do agility, so if that PCL is constantly getting aggravated, it’s just hard to play. And remember, McCaffrey had that at the end of last season. And it, you know, obviously, he recovered through the offseason.

So this is absolutely, assuming this is just a PCL injury, you can’t push through it. It’s just really, really difficult because your knee’s not stable. So once again, everyone’s saying, oh, he just needs to kind of go through this and do all this other stuff.

It’s a structural injury; it’s not a pain tolerance issue.

I would be remiss in my duties without asking you. You’re a doctor, a medical doctor, someone who has degrees.

I’m just a podcaster. I’ve been completely dismissing this notion because it sounds like nonsense, and it sounds like tinfoil hat stuff. Please, please shed some light on this. And please, please, can we put to rest the whole electrical substation thing that is near the practice field?

Yeah, so a couple of things.

Number one is that there’s no real-life data that says that, you know, these kinds of electrical magnetic fields have a direct impact on. Collagen or tendon healing or et cetera in actual people, right? So maybe there’s something in a lab where you’re like exposing, you know, rats or other things to like tons of this radiation.

But in real life, there’s no study that shows this. Number two, the 49ers have practiced at that area since 1988. So they would be the most often injured team since 1988. So number two, number three. There are other athletic facilities across the world that have electrical substations near them that probably are exposed to the same amount of whatever they’re talking about. So I think that what you have to look at, when you look at 49ers injuries, you gotta look at the factors we know you’ve gotta look at prior injury, history, travel, playing on turf, you know, players playing out of position, players playing more snaps and other things who, strength conditioning, coaching, all these other things.

The electrical substation. It’s, it’s, it’s one of those things where you could say that, well, because the San Francisco 49ers team starts with an S and then they’re the most injured team that starts with an S. Is there actually a connection? Can that cause injuries, or is it just one of those things that happens to happen?

So I’m all for looking for data and studying it more and seeing if there’s an impact. But right now, it just isn’t there.

Darnold is dealing with a new oblique injury, putting his playing status in doubt.

Seattle is expected to announce the team’s inactives for today’s game at 6:30 p.m. Eastern, about one hour and thirty minutes before kickoff. What should fans be looking for in the report?

It would be a surprise if Darnold is not active, but Jalen Milroe (who has traditionally been the emergency quarterback on gamedays) also being active could be a sign that the Seahawks have some concerns about the Pro Bowl quarterback’s status.

Darnold has estimated that his chances of not playing tonight is close to 0%. Yet, the Seahawks quarterback will need to go through a series of pregame tests to prove his health.

Assuming there is no setback, Darnold is expected to play tonight against the 49ers. As a reminder, the NFL no longer has the probable injury designation, which sounds like what Darnold would have been listed as if this were an option. The bigger question is how effective Darnold will be while battling the injury.

Here’s what you need to know about Darnold’s injury.

Sam Darnold on Playing in 49ers vs. Seahawks Game: ‘We’ll Be Ready to Go’

Darnold has attempted to downplay the severity of his oblique issue, but it is less than ideal for a team’s starting quarterback to sustain an injury with Seattle just one game away from the NFC Championship. Similar to Week 18, fans can expect a heavy dose of the Seahawks’ rushing attack against the Niners.

“I feel good,” Darnold remarked on his injury during a January 15, 2026, media session, per Seahawks.com. “In routes on air, I just felt a little something in my oblique. I just didn’t want to push it. It wasn’t the day to push it, so that was it. I came inside, got some rehab, and I feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

“… It’s fun. We’ll attack it the next couple of days and be ready to go on Saturday… It is what it is. I felt it on a throw, but we’ll be ready to go.”

Seahawks HC Mike Macdonald on Sam Darnold’s Status: ‘Really Optimistic He’s Going to be Able to Play’

If for some reason Darnold is unable to play, the Seahawks are expected to turn to backup quarterback Drew Lock. Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald sounded optimistic about Darnold’s status while also leaving the door open for Lock playing if the quarterback does not feel himself.

“Really optimistic he’s going to be able to play and right now we’re going through all the protocol,” Macdonald said of Darnold during a January 16, press conference, per Seahawks.com’s Ari Horton. “One, just out of caution to make sure we’re ready to go and we’ll test it out tomorrow to kind of make the final decision.

“But again, we’re optimistic he’s going to play and if he doesn’t or at some point he doesn’t, then Drew’s ready to go and that’s why Drew’s here. He’s doing a great job. So, we’re rolling.”",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254546854-e1768653388290.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-17 16:01:37.790796

According to a former Bill who will be on the opposite sideline Saturday, that shouldn't be a major problem, considering Buffalo's utilization of the position.

""They got a lot of guys banged up, but they don't really throw it to the receivers anyway,"" Denver Broncos wideout Elijah Moore said, per The Denver Gazette's Chris Tomasson.

Moore notably appeared in nine games for the Bills earlier this season, logging nine catches for 112 yards without a touchdown before being released on Nov. 26. He caught on with the Broncos, who elevated him from the practice squad ahead of Denver's Divisional Round matchup against Buffalo.

Sour grapes from Moore or not, Buffalo does indeed find ways to do damage in plenty of other ways outside peppering wideouts with targets -- whether that's letting reigning MVP Josh Allen rumble, getting the ball to a diverse stable of running backs or exposing defenses through tight ends.

While short-yardage maestro Khalil Shakir has nearly double the reception total of any other Bills player with 72, he's one of only two wide receivers among Buffalo's top six reception-getters. The other WR in that collection is Keon Coleman, who has 38 catches and has been a healthy scratch for multiple games this season. Tight ends Dalton Kincaid (39 receptions) and Dawson Knox (36) and running backs James Cook (33) and Ty Johnson (24) round out the rest of the group.

Given the Bills' injury luck of late, they'll likely need to continue to use alternate sources of production against Denver's defense, which ranks third in points allowed.

Wide receiver Josh Palmer, seventh on the team in receptions this season with 22, went on injured reserve before Buffalo's wild-card win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, a game in which Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers both suffered torn ACLs. That leaves the Bills with Shakir, Coleman, Brandin Cooks (signed Nov. 25), Curtis Samuel (activated off IR on Friday) and Mecole Hardman (elevated from the practice squad) at wideout.

We'll see shortly just how often Allen looks the way of his wide receivers against Denver -- and whether or not the Bills wideouts will have any rebuttal to Moore's observation in the form of some big-time contributions.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/rx0uppyjzmtijafyk6to,N,,2026-01-17 12:01:46.520603

The star receiver will be missing this week’s game against the Patriots due to a concussion after officially being ruled out on Friday.

Collins, 26, was unable to practice throughout the week leading up to the second-round playoff affair after exiting the team’s Monday victory with the Steelers early.

,,2026-01-17 13:47:23+00:00,ESPN.com,Mike Macdonald optimistic Sam Darnold (oblique) plays vs. 49ers - ESPN,"Brady Henderson, Nick Wagoner, Tim Keown, Brooke Pryor, Jeremy Fowler, ESPN staff, John Keim, DJ Bien-Aime, Mike Reiss, Courtney Cronin",,,,,https://www.espn.com.au/nfl/story/_/id/47633795/mike-macdonald-optimistic-qb-sam-darnold-oblique-plays-vs-49ers,"RENTON, Wash. -- Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said Friday that he is ""really optimistic"" Sam Darnold will play Saturday against the San Francisco 49ers despite a new oblique injury, echoing what the Pro Bowl quarterback said a day earlier.
The Seahawks listed Darnold as questionable Thursday after he left practice earlier in the day when he felt something in his left side.
He echoed a sentiment shared earlier this week by Macdonald about not getting lost in the hype of the postseason.
""We're treating it [as] just another week, another game,"" Darnold said.
This will be the first playoff game at Lumen Field with fans in the stands since January 2017.","RENTON, Wash. -- Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said Friday that he is ""really optimistic"" Sam Darnold will play Saturday against the San Francisco 49ers despite a new oblique injury, echoing what the Pro Bowl quarterback said a day earlier.

But in his final comments before the Seahawks' divisional round playoff game against their NFC West rival, Macdonald left open the possibility that the injury could take a turn either before or after the 8 p.m. ET kickoff.

The Seahawks listed Darnold as questionable Thursday after he left practice earlier in the day when he felt something in his left side. He told reporters roughly two hours later that he expects to play.

""Talking about Sam, I heard what he said yesterday to you guys; I see it the same way,"" Macdonald told reporters Friday. ""We're listing him as questionable. Really optimistic he's going to be able to play. Right now we're going through all the protocol ... just out of caution to make sure we're ready to go. We'll test it out tomorrow and kind of make the final decision, but again, we're optimistic he's going to play.

""If he doesn't, or at some point he doesn't, then [Drew Lock is] ready to go, and that's why Drew's here. He's doing a great job.""

The Seahawks held a walk-through Friday, as they typically do the day before a game. Macdonald gave a nonanswer when asked whether Darnold threw during the session. While the coach was speaking to reporters on the sideline of the team's indoor practice facility, Darnold and Lock were walking through plays on the field with wide receiver Jake Bobo. Darnold was seen making only light, underhanded tosses.

Macdonald was asked whether Darnold was better physically Friday.

""He says he feels better,"" Macdonald said. ""But you talked to him. He's confident that he's going to be able to play. We feel the same way.""

Is there any thought that he could be at all limited Saturday?

""Well, yeah, it's a possibility,"" Macdonald said. ""I think right now he's confident that he's going to be able to go do his thing at 100 percent. We are too. But with these things, something could change between now and then or something could happen in-game. So we kind of just have to roll with it.""

Lock, a seventh-year veteran with a 10-18 record in 28 career starts, is Darnold's backup. Jalen Milroe, a rookie third-round pick, is Seattle's QB3. Milroe has been inactive as a healthy scratch for the past 12 games, though he has continued to suit up as the emergency third quarterback.

Darnold told reporters that he ""felt a little something"" in the oblique on his left side Thursday while throwing during a routes-on-air period and that he left practice as a precautionary measure. Seattle listed him as a limited participant that day.

""Just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said. ""Wasn't the day to push it. So that was it. Just came inside, got some rehab, and I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play Saturday.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Darnold said he has never dealt with an oblique injury and that he will get more treatment between now and game time, adding: ""We'll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday.""

Aside from Darnold's questionable status, the only other Seattle players with game designations are tight end Elijah Arroyo, linebacker Chazz Surratt and tackle Josh Jones, all backups who have been ruled out. Left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant will return after missing three and two games, respectively.

Cross was limited Wednesday because of a new knee injury but returned to full participation Thursday.

""Just kind of got tangled up a little bit in practice,"" Macdonald said of Cross. ""So we're working through it. He's good to go. It's more of a precautionary thing than anything.""

Darnold, signed by the Seahawks in March after they traded Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders, is set to make the second playoff start of his eight-year NFL career. He echoed a sentiment shared earlier this week by Macdonald about not getting lost in the hype of the postseason.

""We're treating it [as] just another week, another game,"" Darnold said. ""... We've got such great guys in that locker room, mature leaders at every position group. So everyone's just ready to go, attacking the week, per usual, and getting ready to go up against a really good 49ers team that's been rolling, and we're excited to go up against them.""

Darnold and the Seahawks beat the 49ers in Week 18 at Levi's Stadium to win the NFC West and secure the conference's top seed. With that win, Seattle finished the regular season 14-3, the same record Darnold posted last year with the Minnesota Vikings on his way to his first career Pro Bowl selection.

He made the Pro Bowl again this year after completing 67.7% of his passes for 4,048 yards and 25 touchdowns while also committing an NFL-high 20 turnovers.

Darnold lost his playoff debut last January when he was sacked nine times in a wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams. He said the Week 18 win over the 49ers felt like a playoff game because of everything that was at stake and how loud the crowd was at Levi's Stadium.

The Seahawks will have home-field advantage in the rematch.

""Being able to use cadence is going to be huge, and then having our 12s there making noise when they're on offense is crucial,"" Darnold said. ""So it's going to be an awesome atmosphere and something we're all looking forward to.""

This will be the first playoff game at Lumen Field with fans in the stands since January 2017. The Seahawks' only other home playoff game since then was at the end of the 2020 COVID-19 season, when they lost in the wild-card round to the Rams in an empty stadium.

""We know Lumen's going to be rocking,"" Darnold said. ""It's an important game. We don't get it twisted at all. We understand the implications of the game. The playoffs, it's awesome to be playing in games like this, especially in January. But yeah, we're treating this week as another week, and we're excited about it.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0116%2Fr1601609_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 16:01:40.944100

It's not quite time for Warner yet, however, as he missed practice Thursday while the 49ers ruled him out for Saturday's Divisional Round game. Shanahan is confident next week will be a different story, should the 49ers advance.

""Yes, I do feel confident in that,"" Shanahan said of Warner's return before the NFC Championship Game. ""We'll see if it works out.""

To get Warner back, the 49ers must power past the Seahawks, who beat them 13-3 in a Week 18 game that determined the NFC West champion and the NFC's No. 1 seed. It'll be a daunting challenge, especially with two-time All-Pro tight end George Kittle out for the season with a torn Achilles.

“I had to kind of let it settle down a little bit,” Stolarz said. “It’s not like a bruise where it goes away. It was just something that I just kind of had to let heal on its own. And, you know, it just took a little while.”

Stolarz figured he would need a few additional practices before he was ready to return to game action.

The challenge for him and the Leafs will be finding the space for those practices. The team has hardly practised of late amid an Olympic-condensed schedule, which has it, like every other team, playing every other night.

Until Friday, Stolarz had been limited to joining the group at morning skates.

“It’s great to see him in full practice,” Leafs coach Craig Berube said. “This road trip, I think, was really important, that he came on the trip and (was) around the guys and getting acclimated again and getting some practice time at the same time.”

Joseph Woll didn’t practise Friday, which meant Stolarz didn’t have to share a net with another goaltender. He could get in a full practise’s worth of shots, in other words.

Woll and Dennis Hildeby have shared the Leafs’ crease in Stolarz’s absence.

“I think they held the fort,” Berube said.

William Nylander, meanwhile, didn’t practise Friday. Berube said he was “doubtful” to play Saturday against the Jets in Winnipeg and was still being evaluated for the injury that caused him to leave Thursday’s overtime loss to the Vegas Golden Knights after only four shifts.

The Leafs’ leading scorer aggravated the undisclosed injury that kept him out for six games recently. Thursday was only his fourth game back.

Asked if Nylander’s absence would be short or long term, Berube said, “Right now I can’t answer that. With the last one, I thought it would be quicker and then obviously (it) wasn’t. We’ll just see how he feels here going forward.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/05/08121505/USATSI_25992435-scaled-e1746721071992.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-17 11:03:19.439025

Ahead of the team's divisional round game at the Denver Broncos, the team activated defensive tackle Ed Oliver and wide receiver Curtis Samuel from injured reserve Friday. Oliver and Samuel had their practice windows opened this week.

Wide receiver Mecole Hardman Jr. and running Frank Gore Jr. were elevated from the practice squad. Running back Ty Johnson, who missed last week's game, is questionable with an ankle injury.

There were already previously two open spots on the roster as receivers Tyrell Shavers and Gabe Davis were placed on injured reserve with torn ACLs suffered in last weekend's win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Samuel (elbow) and Hardman give the team five receivers for Saturday's game, along with Khalil Shakir, Brandin Cooks and Keon Coleman.

Oliver's return brings a boost to a defensive tackle group that has dealt with a variety of injuries this season. The seven-year veteran was placed on IR on Oct. 28 with a left biceps tear that required surgery, then suffered meniscus damage while rehabbing that led to a minimally invasive procedure Dec. 29.

""It's just a long time coming,"" Oliver said of his return to practice. ""I kind of just stayed the course even when the tunnel seemed dark and the light at the end of the tunnel seemed so far away.""

In three games played this season -- he also missed time with an ankle injury early in the year -- Oliver had three sacks and a forced fumble.

""[Oliver] loves to play,"" coach Sean McDermott said Thursday. ""There's a process that leads to playing, and he's worked hard at it. Had the setback, obviously, a few weeks ago with the knee, but he's attacked it head-on, and our medical staff the same way. So, both have done a good job.""

The defensive tackle noted this week that he feels ""kind of fresh,"" especially compared with other players at this point, after not playing for so much of the season.

Bills quarterback depth chart","Josh Allen showed up on the injury report with three different issues this week. He's going to show up for his 137th consecutive start on Saturday.

The Buffalo Bills quarterback was listed with knee, foot and right finger injuries, was a limited participant during Tuesday’s walk-through, then practiced fully Wednesday and Thursday. Allen carries no injury designation into Sunday’s 4:30 p.m. ET divisional round matchup against the Denver Broncos.

The foot injury dates back to Week 16 against Cleveland, when Allen underwent postgame X-rays that were negative. He aggravated the issue a week later against Philadelphia but continued to play and has not missed any meaningful time since.

The knee and finger injuries are more recent, both occurring during Buffalo’s wild-card win over Jacksonville. Allen was briefly evaluated for a concussion after a first-quarter hit, later jammed his throwing hand when it struck the helmet of guard O’Cyrus Torrence on a second-quarter follow-through, and tweaked his left knee on a 2-yard touchdown run. None of the injuries forced him to miss a snap.

Saturday will mark Allen's 137 consecutive start, made up of 122 regular season and 15 playoff games, the longest active streak among NFL quarterbacks.

Is Josh Allen playing today?

Yes. Allen has no injury designation and practiced fully the final two days of the week.

“I feel good,” Allen said on Tuesday. “Honestly, I feel better than I have the last few weeks.""

The Super Bowl matchup will take shape Sunday, Jan. 25, when both conference championship games will be played.","Conference championship game berths are up for grabs in the NFL playoffs.

The postseason resumes Saturday with a pair of Divisional Round showdowns – one in the AFC and one in the NFC. And both matchups feature a No. 6-seeded wild card team visiting a No. 1 seed coming off of a first-round bye.

The two-game slate kicks off in the Mile High City as the No. 1 Denver Broncos welcome in the No. 6 Buffalo Bills. This is the second straight postseason that Buffalo and Denver have met – the Bills cruised past the Broncos 31-7 at home in last year’s Wild Card Round.

Josh Allen and the Bills are in the Divisional Round for the sixth straight year as they look to make back-to-back conference championship games. Allen engineered two separate go-ahead touchdown drives in the fourth quarter to lead the Bills past the No. 3 Jacksonville Jaguars 27-24 in the Wild Card Round.

Buffalo, in search of its first-ever Super Bowl title, now visits a Broncos team that has lost just once at home this season and is powered by an elite defense. Denver led the league in sacks with 68 – 11 more than the next-closest team – while ranking second in yards against and third in points against.

Sean Payton's Broncos are seeking the franchise’s first playoff victory since its 2015 championship season.

The action then shifts to Seattle for a NFC West clash between the No. 6 San Francisco 49ers and No. 1 Seattle Seahawks. The already injury-riddled 49ers lost star tight end George Kittle to a torn Achilles in the Wild Card Round, but they still managed to upset the defending Super Bowl champion No. 3 Philadelphia Eagles 23-19. Brock Purdy quarterbacked a go-ahead touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter before San Francisco’s defense came up with a game-sealing stop.

San Francisco now faces Seattle for the second time in three weeks and the third time this season. While the 49ers beat the Seahawks on the road in Week 1, Seattle got revenge in Week 18 with a 13-3 win to capture the division crown and the No. 1 seed. The Seahawks’ top-ranked scoring defense limited the 49ers to 173 yards of total offense and held them to a combined 2-for-11 on third and fourth downs in the second meeting.

But whether Sam Darnold will have any limitations is the biggest storyline entering the playoff matchup, and that's assuming he actually makes the start. The Seahawks quarterback is listed as questionable after appearing on the injury report this week with an oblique injury.

Seattle is looking to make the conference title game for the first time since the 2014 season, while San Francisco is on the brink of its fourth appearance in five years.

Macdonald said that Darnold feels better a day removed from pain popping up and explained that he will test things out Saturday before a final decision is made.

Macdonald didn't disclose whether Darnold threw during the team's walkthrough Friday.

The second-year Seahawks coach was asked if the oblique issue could limit the way Darnold plays.

""Well, yeah, that's a possibility,"" Macdonald said. ""I think right now he's confident that he's going to be able to go do his thing at 100%, and we are, too. But with these things, something could change between now and then or something could happen in-game. So kind of just have to roll with it.""

Macdonald clarified, however, that the Seahawks won't put Darnold out there if he's not fit to do his job.

Drew Lock is Seattle's backup. He's appeared in five games this season but attempted only three passes. A 2019 second-round pick out of Missouri, Lock has started 28 games in his career, including two for the Seahawks during the 2023 season.

Darnold told reporters he felt something in his oblique early in practice Thursday when throwing routes.

""Just didn't want to push it. It wasn't the day to push it,"" Darnold said, per Gregg Bell of The Tacoma News Tribune. ""So that was it. Just came inside, got some rehab. I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold said he never had oblique issues before. He put a positive spin on the midweek hurdle that he's eager to clear ahead of the biggest game of his career.

""It's fun. We'll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday,"" Darnold added.

Darnold, a righty, explained at the time that he experienced the discomfort on his left side on a throw.

He was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play against the 49ers this weekend at Seattle's Lumen Field.

""Very low percentage,"" he said Thursday. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Darnold played all 17 games in the regular season, his first with the Seahawks after signing a three-year deal reportedly worth $100.5 million.

He picked up where he left off in Minnesota last season when he led the Vikings to a 14-3 record as a replacement for the injured J.J. McCarthy.

This time around, he became the fourth quarterback in NFL history to guide two different teams to 14-win seasons, joining Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Jared Goff.

Despite a league-high 20 turnovers, Darnold made the Pro Bowl. With a win over San Francisco in the regular-season finale, Seattle earned the division title and the NFC's No. 1 seed, which came with a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.

Darnold is now slated to face the resilient 49ers again. He's hoping for playoff redemption after throwing a pick, losing a fumble and being sacked nine times during the Vikings' 27-9 wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams last season.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/beCv9xn2YO20orJLfepxYw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/f83c21d0-e5bf-11f0-b2bf-afb15505eb98,N,,2026-01-17 06:58:22.402999

The battle for the Lombardi Trophy is as wide open as it has been in years, and nobody would be surprised by any of the remaining eight sides going on to taste glory in Santa Clara next month.

But who will emerge victorious this weekend as the number one seeds enter the fray?

We have our panel of experts to try to pick the winners, including Radio 5 Live's Rob Staton, BBC Sport journalist Paul Higham and our special guest, former NFL coach Phil McGeoghan.

You can also pick your winners below.

Rob Staton: Bills

I've just got a sense that Josh Allen might will his team to victory again. This is his big opportunity this season so can he take advantage?

Phil McGeoghan: Broncos

My wife's from Buffalo and we met when I was coaching for the Buffalo Bills, but I've spent most of my career in Bronco land. So I'm not going to say it out loud. She gets a little fired up, but that's who we're going for in this house (Broncos), but that's only in the basement. So I'm subterranean Phil. I can't wait to see what happens, but I'm going to be doing it well below ground, cheering as quietly as possible for the Denver Broncos.

Mike White: Broncos

The way this season has unfolded it seems like the door has been left wide open on the AFC side for Josh Allen and the Bills to finally end their wait not only for a return to the big game but also for their first Lombardi success.

However, I'm finding it hard to look past the Broncos, who had the advantage of the bye week, have a dominant defence, know about winning games in comeback mode and aren't banged up the way Buffalo are - especially at the wide receiver position. I'll take Denver to progress but in a close one by three points or less.

Paul Higham: Broncos

Denver won the last Super Bowl at Levi's Stadium (the venue for Super Bowl 60 next month) a decade ago, which was also their last play-off win - while it's the only stadium in the league Josh Allen has yet to play in, so there's a hint of destiny about both sides.

Allen got his first road play-off win last week, Buffalo's first since 1993, but he got beat up in Jacksonville, has a depleted bunch of receivers, and if James Cook again struggles against Denver's rush defence even Superman himself may just have too much to overcome by himself.

And ironically it could be the legs of Bo Nix that do more damage, as Buffalo gave up the most yards per carry to opposing quarterbacks this season. It'll be close but Denver went 11-2 in one-score games this season.

Rob Staton: Seahawks

You've got to give Kyle Shanahan and his team a tonne of credit for what they've achieved amid an injury crisis, but realistically this might be a game too far.

Mike White: Seahawks

This feels like a game too far for the Niners against a highly talented Seattle, who boast a stingy defence whilst San Fran are battered, bruised and without big-name, big-game players such as George Kittle, Nick Bosa and Fred Warner.

Sam Darnold has an injury designation going into this but is expected to play. Once upon a time, that would've been a boost for any of Seattle's opponents, but the post-New York Jets Darnold is a different proposition and the one-time former 49ers back-up will lead them to the NFC title game. Seahawks by 10.

Phil McGeoghan: Niners

Very interesting game. The 49ers are decimated by injuries, but the best predictor of future events is past events. They've found a way to overcome injuries for quite some time so that means culture has now taken over and it's a winning culture. You don't forget how to win.

Paul Higham: Seahawks

Sam Darnold led the league in turnovers and has an injury, so Seattle will hope to win this with their improving ground game, which averaged 140 yards a game over the last eight weeks, against San Francisco's ailing rush defence heading in the opposite direction.

The pass rush is another decider - the Niners ranked last in sacks and second-last in quarterback pressures as their pass rush unit is basically all out injured. Seattle, meanwhile, get consistent pressure and dominated two weeks ago having upped their blitz rate.

Throw in the famous Seahawks 12s and a flight back across the country for the 49ers from Philadelphia on a short week and there's just too much in the home side's favour.

Rob Staton: Patriots

The Texans' defence is legit and can win them any game, but Drake Maye's mobility and playmaking is the perfect counter. Pats get it done.

Phil McGeoghan: Patriots

The Texans have changed games, ruined games, so you must have a protection plan for the Houston Texans. They will ruin your weekend. In my mind, though, just looking at the way Drake Maye is playing at this particular point and the way that they're just kind of moving, I think it's the Patriots, right?

I am from Boston. So I think if I go home and I don't say the Patriots, I might be in the 'harbour' or something. So I will say I think it's going to be the Patriots.

Mike White: Patriots

This is likely to be a tight affair with very few points in the game. The Patriots offence matching up against that forceful Texans defence feels like the match-up to keep an eye on. And with CJ Stroud set to be without his best receiving option in Nico Collins (concussion), Houston's chances just reduced considerably.

Mike Vrabel's already a strong coach of the season candidate, and returning the Patriots back to their once-familiar surroundings of the AFC Championship game will only enhance those credentials. Pats take it by six.

Paul Higham: Texans

Houston's first road play-off win last week was a statement win for this terrifying defence, but the Pats have won a league-leading eight straight Divisional games.

Drake Maye's mobility can slow Houston down but I just can't see him doing enough to keep them off his case enough throughout the game. As long as CJ Stroud cleans things up and doesn't have another five fumbles, I'm backing the Texans to make their first AFC Championship game.

Rob Staton: Bears

There's just a bit of magic about the Bears at the moment and the Rams have not played their best football in weeks. Soldier Field will be rocking and I think Chicago make it to the NFC Championship.

Mike White: Rams

The Chicago Bears' renaissance has been nothing short of remarkable and Ben Johnson deserves a tonne of credit for it. As does Caleb Williams who's defied a lot of the (justified) rookie season critics in his second year.

That said, this is a Rams team that many have been crowning as the champions-elect for weeks and not without good reason. Whether it's offensive guru Sean McVay, the experience and MVP qualities of Matthew Stafford or the magic hands of Puka Nacua, they have all the ingredients for another Super Bowl run. The predicted Arctic conditions might be somewhat of a leveller but still taking the Rams by four.

Phil McGeoghan: Rams

I am such a fan of Sean McVay. His mind, the way it works, his gameplans, also his humour. His willingness to be open. All these things matter in football.

Because of his personality and how he is with the players, he admires his guys. He doesn't pretend Davante Adams isn't one of the best to ever do it. He doesn't pretend he's not in awe of Matthew Stafford when he makes one of his no-look throws. That stuff really builds culture.

That's why they've won Super Bowls, that's why people don't leave there unless they get promoted and get better jobs, because McVay is such a good man and he's a brilliant, brilliant offensive mind so I'm picking Sean McVay and the Rams for those reasons.

Paul Higham: Bears

Only four quarterbacks have thrown for 140-plus yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter of a play-off win in the past 20 years - and two of them collide at Soldier Field.

So this genuinely could be decided by whether Matthew Stafford or Caleb Williams, who have combined for 29 fourth-quarter touchdowns this season, has the ball last after both earned thrilling late wins last week.

Williams has been doing it all season though, and watching last week even when they were well behind it seemed inevitable the Bears would come roaring back to win. It just gives you a funny feeling that they've got something special rolling in the Windy City.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_sport/1200/cpsprodpb/e901/live/00933e60-f284-11f0-b385-5f48925de19a.png,N,,2026-01-17 07:57:48.583913

The Bears will have two players questionable for Sunday’s game, including wide receiver Rome Odunze, who practiced in full Friday but is still being impacted by a foot injury that’s been nagging him in the second half of the season.

Odunze, who sat out for more than a month with the injury, was targeted six times in Sunday’s game against the Packers, with two receptions for 44 yards, including a clutch fourth-down reception that kept the Bears alive in the game.

The Bears also said that linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin will be questionable after he was limited Friday with a back injury.

The expectation is that Michael Penix Jr., whom the Falcons drafted at No.
A recent development that could benefit Penix's progress toward that position is the hiring of Ryan as the Falcons' president of football.
Then, last season, Penix went 3-6 before sustaining a season-ending knee injury in the Falcons' Week 11 overtime loss to the Carolina Panthers.
""It's working together to figure out the right plan for Mike and his rehab,"" Ryan said.","FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. — If anyone knows what it's like to be the Atlanta Falcons' franchise quarterback, it's Matt Ryan.

The Falcons drafted Ryan with the No. 3 overall pick in 2008, and he went on to be the Falcons' starter for 14 seasons. Ryan ultimately led Atlanta to six playoff appearances, including a Super Bowl run in 2016. After he retired, the Falcons inducted Ryan into their Ring of Honor because of the player he was on and off the field throughout his tenure.

The expectation is that Michael Penix Jr., whom the Falcons drafted at No. 8 overall in 2024, will become a franchise player in his own right and provide stability at quarterback. Owner Arthur Blank reiterated as much just last week.

A recent development that could benefit Penix's progress toward that position is the hiring of Ryan as the Falcons' president of football.

""I'm not hired to come in and be the quarterback coach, but I love Mike and have gotten to know him through the last couple of years here in Atlanta,"" Ryan said. ""So, anything he needs from me, I'm a part of this organization and happy to help in any way that I can.""

Ryan became a mentor of sorts for Penix last year, after then-Falcons head coach Raheem Morris made it clear Penix would be Atlanta's starting quarterback in 2025. That proclamation came after Penix started the Falcons' final three games of 2024.

Originally, Penix wasn't supposed to start at all as a rookie. Instead, Kirk Cousins was signed as a free agent that offseason to be the Falcons' starter. The plan was for Cousins to lead for at least a season or two, while Penix learned the ropes behind the veteran. However, in Week 16, the Falcons benched Cousins due to performance issues and accelerated Penix's timeline.

Penix went 1-2 in those three starts, completing 58% of his passes for an average of 245.7 yards per game. He threw three interceptions and three touchdowns.

Then, last season, Penix went 3-6 before sustaining a season-ending knee injury in the Falcons' Week 11 overtime loss to the Carolina Panthers. He underwent surgery for a partially torn ACL in late November. Blank said it went well.

""The surgeon felt 1,000% secure in the medical procedure they went through, and they really felt his knee was going to be even better than it was before,"" Blank said. ""He's on a successful rehab program. He's back in Atlanta. He's committed mentally. Physically, he feels good.""

Prior to his injury, Penix completed 60.1% of his passes for an average of 220.2 yards per game. He threw three interceptions and nine touchdowns.

""The next thing in front of Mike is the rehab process, and he's already at it,"" Ryan said. ""I was in here (Monday) morning … and he was in there getting after his rehab. So, he's in a good mental space right there and is doing exactly what he should be doing right now.""

The NFL's new league year begins on March 11. Clubs that hired a new head coach, including the Falcons, can begin offseason workout programs on April 6. Training camps start in mid-July.

However, Seattle has some injury concerns at the most important position entering the game.

Quarterback Sam Darnold suffered an oblique injury in practice on Thursday ahead of Saturday's game, and on Friday's injury report, he was officially listed as questionable.

Speaking to the media, Seahawks coach Mike MacDonald said he remains ""optimistic"" that Darnold will be able to suit up against San Francisco despite the injury designation. He added that the team would ""test it out"" on Saturday before making a final decision and that backup Drew Lock will be ready to go if Darnold is not able to go.

Darnold addressed his injury with the media on Thursday, stating that there is ""closer to zero"" chance that he isn't able to play in the Divisional Round showdown. MacDonald seems to share Darnold's confidence.

If he ultimately isn't able to play, it would be a major loss for Seattle. Darnold's 2025 season began at an MVP pace, and though he cooled off a bit down the stretch, he still finished fifth in the league in passing yards (4,048) and tied for ninth in passing touchdowns (25).

If Darnold isn't cleared to play, Lock will make his first career postseason start. He's certainly no stranger to starting games as he's done so 28 times in his six-year career, but he only appeared in five games this season as Darnold's backup and has just three pass attempts in 2025.

Seattle is hoping to emerge from a wide-open NFC, but its playoff hopes may rest on Darnold's ability to play in Saturday's matchup against the 49ers.","https://ftw.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/16/SCOL/88220224007-usatsi-27928431.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-16 21:59:32.496535

The Seahawks listed Darnold as questionable Friday after he left practice earlier in the day when he felt something in his left side.
He echoed a sentiment shared earlier this week by Macdonald about not getting lost in the hype of the postseason.
""We're treating it [as] just another week, another game,"" Darnold said.
This will be the first playoff game at Lumen Field with fans in the stands since January 2017.","RENTON, Wash. -- Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said Friday that he is ""really optimistic"" Sam Darnold will play Saturday against the San Francisco 49ers despite a new oblique injury, echoing what the Pro Bowl quarterback said a day earlier.

But in his final comments of the week before the Seahawks' divisional round playoff game against their NFC West rival, Macdonald left open the possibility that the injury could take a turn either before or after the 8 p.m. ET kickoff.

The Seahawks listed Darnold as questionable Friday after he left practice earlier in the day when he felt something in his left side. He told reporters roughly two hours later that he expects to play.

""Talking about Sam, I heard what he said yesterday to you guys; I see it the same way,"" Macdonald told reporters Friday. ""We're listing him as questionable. Really optimistic he's going to be able to play. Right now we're going through all the protocol ... just out of caution to make sure we're ready to go. We'll test it out tomorrow and kind of make the final decision, but again, we're optimistic he's going to play.

""If he doesn't, or at some point he doesn't, then [Drew Lock is] ready to go, and that's why Drew's here. He's doing a great job.""

The Seahawks held a walk-through Friday, as they typically do the day before a game. Macdonald gave a nonanswer when asked whether Darnold threw during the session. While the coach was speaking to reporters on the sideline of the team's indoor practice facility, Darnold and Lock were walking through plays on the field with receiver Jake Bobo. Darnold was seen making only light, underhanded tosses.

Macdonald was asked whether Darnold was better physically Friday.

""Yeah, he says he feels better,"" Macdonald said. ""But you talked to him. He's confident that he's going to be able to play. We feel the same way.""

Is there any thought that he could be at all limited Saturday?

""Well, yeah. It's a possibility,"" Macdonald said. ""I think right now he's confident that he's going to be able to go do his thing at 100 percent. We are, too. But with these things, something could change between now and then or something could happen in-game. So we kind of just have to roll with it.""

Lock, a seventh-year veteran with a 10-18 record in 28 career starts, is Darnold's backup. Jalen Milroe, a rookie third-round pick, is Seattle's QB3. Milroe has been inactive as a healthy scratch for the past 12 games, though he has continued to suit up as the emergency third quarterback.

Darnold's injury occurred Thursday. He told reporters that he ""felt a little something"" in the oblique on his left side while throwing during a routes-on-air period, and that he left practice as a precautionary measure. Seattle listed him as a limited participant that day.

""Just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said. ""Wasn't the day to push it. So that was it. Just came inside, got some rehab, and I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play Saturday.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Darnold said he has never dealt with an oblique injury and that he'll get more treatment between now and game time, adding: ""We'll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday.""

Aside from Darnold's questionable status, the only other Seattle players with game designations are tight end Elijah Arroyo, linebacker Chazz Surratt and tackle Josh Jones, all backups who have been ruled out. Left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant will return after missing three and two games, respectively.

Cross was limited Wednesday because of a new knee injury but returned to full participation Thursday.

""Just kind of got tangled up a little bit in practice,"" Macdonald said of Cross. ""So we're working through it. He's good to go. It's more of a precautionary thing than anything.""

Darnold, signed by the Seahawks in March after they traded Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders, is set to make the second playoff start of his eight-year NFL career. He echoed a sentiment shared earlier this week by Macdonald about not getting lost in the hype of the postseason.

""We're treating it [as] just another week, another game,"" Darnold said. ""... We've got such great guys in that locker room, mature leaders at every position group. So everyone's just ready to go, attacking the week, per usual, and getting ready to go up against a really good 49ers team that's been rolling, and we're excited to go up against them.""

Darnold and the Seahawks beat the 49ers in Week 18 at Levi's Stadium to win the NFC West and secure the conference's top seed. With that win, Seattle finished the regular season 14-3, the same record Darnold posted last year with the Minnesota Vikings on his way to his first career Pro Bowl selection.

He made the Pro Bowl again this year, completing 67.7% of his attempts for 4,048 yards and 25 touchdown passes while also committing an NFL-high 20 turnovers.

Darnold lost his playoff debut last January when he was sacked nine times in a wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams. He said the Week 18 win over the 49ers felt like a playoff game because of everything that was at stake and how loud the crowd was at Levi's Stadium.

The Seahawks will have home-field advantage in the rematch.

""Being able to use cadence is going to be huge, and then having our 12s there making noise when they're on offense is crucial,"" Darnold said. ""So, it's going to be an awesome atmosphere and something we're all looking forward to.""

This will be the first playoff game at Lumen Field with fans in the stands since January 2017. The Seahawks' only other home playoff game since then was at the end of the 2020 COVID-19 season, when they lost in the wild-card round to the Rams in an empty stadium.

""We know Lumen's going to be rocking,"" Darnold said. ""It's an important game. We don't get it twisted at all. We understand the implications of the game. The playoffs, it's awesome to be playing in games like this, especially in January. But yeah, we're treating this week as another week, and we're excited about it.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0116%2Fr1601609_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 20:00:14.731937

He and fellow wide receiver Justin Watson will both miss the divisional round as they make their way through concussion protocol.","The Houston Texans are back in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs for the third year in a row under coach DeMeco Ryans.

Once again, Houston has one of the top defenses in the league, especially against the pass. Edge rushers Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter lead the way up front with first-team All-Pro cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. setting the tone in the secondary.

Houston's offense endured a tumultuous start to the season under first-year coordinator Nick Caley and a rookie starting left tackle in Aireontae Ersery. But the Texans found more of a groove down the stretch of the regular season.

Their 30-6 win over Pittsburgh in the wild-card round marked their 10th win in a row, and they overcame five fumbles by quarterback C.J. Stroud. Houston earned that win despite missing leading receiver Nico Collins for most of the second half. He entered the league's concussion protocol after trying to catch a pass over the middle of the field and landing hard on his head.

Houston will face the New England Patriots in the divisional round of the playoffs. Will the Texans have their top wide receiver for that contest? Here's the latest on Collins' status:

Is Nico Collins playing against the Patriots?

Collins will not suit up against New England. The Texans ruled him out in their final injury report released Friday, Jan. 16.

He and fellow wide receiver Justin Watson will both miss the divisional round as they make their way through concussion protocol.

Houston will lean on veteran Christian Kirk again as well as rookie Jayden Higgins at the position with Collins sidelined.

What is the NFL's concussion protocol?

The NFL breaks its concussion protocol down into five distinct steps. The process is designed to break up the recovery process from a head injury, ensuring a player's safety.

Here are the five steps of the protocol, according to the NFL:","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/16/USAT/88220581007-usatsi-27930278.jpg?crop=5698,3205,x0,y431&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-16 20:00:25.756433

“He’s confident he’s going to be able to play,” Macdonald said.","Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said he’s “really optimistic” quarterback Sam Darnold will play Saturday night despite the quarterback being listed as questionable with an oblique injury ahead of their divisional-round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers at Lumen Field.

“Right now, we’re going through all the protocols out of caution, making sure we are ready to go,” Macdonald said Friday afternoon.

Darnold spoke with reporters Thursday after practice. He said he plans to play.

The Seahawks held a light, pad-less walkthrough practice Friday morning. Macdonald declined to say whether Darnold threw passes during the session. He said it’s possible that the oblique injury could limit Darnold in the game.

“But right now, he’s confident he’s gonna be able to go do his thing 100 percent. We are, too,” Macdonald said. He later added: “I don’t think we’d put him out there if he couldn’t do his job.”

Darnold said that he “felt something” in his left side while throwing during Thursday’s practice. Out of caution, Darnold left practice early to receive treatment, which he said will continue through Saturday. Backup quarterback Drew Lock took over as the first-team QB when Darnold exited. Lock would start if Darnold were deemed unable to play or suffered an in-game injury.

Macdonald said Darnold currently “feels better” than he did the day of the injury.

“He’s confident he’s going to be able to play,” Macdonald said.

As long as Darnold’s able to go, this will be his second career playoff start and first with the Seahawks. He lost his only career playoff start while playing for the Minnesota Vikings last season.

Saturday’s game will be the third meeting this season between the Seahawks and 49ers. The NFC West rivals split the season series, with both teams winning on the road. Seattle’s 13-3 win over the 49ers in Week 18 clinched Seattle’s first NFC West title since 2020 and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for the first time since 2014.

This will be Seattle’s first playoff game with fans in attendance since the 2016 season; the Lumen Field stands were empty due to COVID-19 when Seattle lost a wild-card game to the Los Angeles Rams in January 2021.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/13205410/GettyImages-2252121049-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-16 21:59:54.123412

Houston’s top wide receiver suffered the concussion in the team’s Monday night wild-card victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins had three catches on seven targets for 21 yards against the Steelers before exiting the game. The injury happened on a play where Collins tried to corral a C.J. Stroud pass, with Steelers cornerback Joey Porter Jr. draped on his back. Collins went to the ground headfirst and, after being helped to the sideline and evaluated in the medical tent, was eventually carted to the locker room.

Wide receiver Christian Kirk stepped up for the Texans on Monday and was enjoying a good game even before Collins exited with the injury. Kirk finished with eight catches on nine targets for 144 yards. He also caught a 6-yard touchdown from Stroud in the second quarter.

Collins played in 15 games during the regular season. His 71 catches were comfortably the most by a Texans wide receiver and were only behind tight end Dalton Schultz’s 82 for the team lead. Collins led the team in receiving yards with 1,117 and receiving touchdowns with six. He showed a tendency to make plays in the biggest moments, as illustrated by his team-leading 48 receptions for first downs.

Kirk’s emergence on Monday was an encouraging sign for the Texans, but it’s something they’ll need to have with more consistency. Kirk didn’t have a single 100-yard receiving game in his 13 regular-season appearances, and he only crossed the 50-yard threshold twice. His most productive output before the wild-card game was five catches for 54 yards and a touchdown in a Week 7 win over the Buffalo Bills.

Aside from Kirk, the Texans will rely on Schultz, whose 106 targets during the regular season were behind only Collins’ 120. They’ll also need more production from wide receivers Jayden Higgins, Xavier Hutchinson and Jaylin Noel. Fellow receiver Justin Watson, who had just three catches for 30 yards this season, was also ruled out of Sunday’s game with a concussion.

The opponent doesn’t make things any easier, either. The Patriots allowed the ninth-fewest passing yards per game in the regular season and will have their top cornerback, Christian Gonzalez, who is also returning from a concussion. Establishing a running game could also help ease some of the pressure off Stroud and the passing game as they navigate things without the unit’s top playmaker.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/16154308/GettyImages-2256272719-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-16 21:59:58.294802

Seahawks coach ‘really optimistic’ QB Sam Darnold will play vs. 49ers

It was expected that Darnold’s left tackle, Charles Cross, would make his return to the field after missing the last three games of the regular season with a knee injury. But then Cross popped up on the injury report Wednesday, limited with not just the knee injury but also a new hamstring concern.

Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald addressed Cross’ status when he had his final press conference before Saturday’s game at team headquarters on Friday afternoon, explaining what happened with Cross.

“Kind of got tangled up a little bit in practice, and so we’re working through it,” Macdonald said.

What’s changed since Seattle Seahawks, 49ers met in Week 18

Cross did not have a game designation – out, doubtful or questionable – when Seattle’s final injury report for Saturday’s contest was released Thursday, and Macdonald’s comments Friday were in line with that.

“He’s good to go. It’s more of a precautionary thing than anything,” the Seahawks coach said.

No doubt that’s great news for the Seahawks and their fans as the NFC’s top seed readies for the sixth-seeded 49ers in the NFC Divisional Round.

Cross, who was only limited in practice this week on Wednesday, is a crucial part of Seattle’s offense, as evidenced by the four-year, $104.4 million contract extension he was signed to earlier this month.

Saturday’s NFC Divisional Round playoff game between the Seahawks and 49ers is set for a 5 p.m. kickoff, with radio coverage on Seattle Sports beginning at 2 p.m. with the pregame show.

•••••••

• Nothing says “wow” like bad news. There was some of that last night from Pullman. For both men’s basketball teams competing at Beasley.

The home team endured what even its coach termed a bit of regression and fell, 86-65 to No. 9 Gonzaga in a West Coast Conference game. The loss dropped Washington State to 8-11 overall and 3-3 in conference play.

But the visitors may have suffered the more-long-lasting blow and it came in the days leading up to Thursday’s showdown.

Braden Huff, one of the twins of GU’s towering front line, suffered an undisclosed left knee injury at practice. An injury the Zags said could keep him off the floor from four weeks – not too bad – to eight – that stretches to March Madness, right?

No matter how you try to splice it, which may not be the right word to use, considering Huff seems to have avoided surgery, it’s not good news for an 18-1 team that holds national title aspirations.

For most of the 6,439 folks in attendance wearing their Zag shirt, the Huff news immediately rode shotgun down to Pullman, with the game forced to the backseat.

That Graham Ike, the other towering figure inside, took over, scoring 23 points, grabbing 11 rebounds and dishing out five assists helped mitigate the anxiety. For one night anyway.

• The next test for the Zags comes Saturday in Seattle. At 7 p.m. In Climate Pledge Arena. Against host Seattle University. Why, exactly? Not the game itself. Or even the venue. That’s obvious.

But the Seahawks’ home playoff game against the 49ers kicks off at 5 p.m. on Fox. Anything – anything at all, including the opera or a lecture on the efficacy of traffic control – in Seattle during that game is facing stiff competition for eyeballs, feet, butts, whatever folks take with them when they make a decision to attend a sporting event.

The University of Washington understood that. So did 12th-ranked Michigan State and the Big Ten Conference. Instead of pitting their men’s basketball game up against the first choice of most casual fans, they moved the start time up to 3 p.m., meaning a Husky follower can attend, leave whenever the Spartans take control and still be home in time to watch at least ¾ of the playoff game.

I’m guessing that’s the downside of playing in Climate Pledge. The start time was locked in with no wiggle room. UW controls Hec Ed. And the game is only on the Big Ten Network. Making the change might not have been easy but it was possible. The Redhawks’ biggest home game of the WCC season? Not so much.

• Now you know the Hawks’ start time, what about the three other playoff games? The weekend slate kicks off Saturday with the AFC’s No. 1 seed, Denver, hosting Buffalo (1:30, CBS). Whatever the Rocky Mountain weather throws at these teams tomorrow – it is supposed to be clear and cold – both teams are used to it.

The same can’t be said for Sunday’s first game, Houston at New England (noon, ABC). The Texans not only live in a temperate climate, they play indoors. Where it never snows, which is in Boston’s forecast.

And in Chicago’s? Maybe not, though showers are possible. The weather highlight? Bitter cold, with a high of 19 and a low of 3. The Rams – again, temperate city, indoor arena – have to venture outdoors in their attempt to topple the seemingly impossible-to-kill Bears (3:30 p.m., NBC).

• What else is there on TV this weekend from the sports world?

Surprisingly, a tennis Grand Slam event. Though, of course, it is the Australian Open, as summer beats down in Melbourne (4 p.m. Sunday, ESPN2). And golf, with the PGA Tour’s new year really gets going in Hawaii with the Sony Open (4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday on the Golf Channel).

As for men’s college hoops, the slate is slim. Three matchups of ranked teams on Saturday (No. 19 Florida and No. 10 Vanderbilt, 11 a.m., ESPN, No. 21 Georgia hosting No. 17 Arkansas, 1 p.m., ESPN2 and No. 11 BYU at No. 15 Texas Tech, 5, ESPN). None on Sunday.

The women’s schedule is even lighter, with only No. 12 Maryland hosting No. 3 UCLA on Sunday at 1 p.m. (NBC) as a matchup with national interest. Big Ten games don’t get more traditional than that, right?

Yet it was all so … predictable.

Last week, The Athletic asked a panel of NFL coaches and team executives to predict the wild-card round winners, and it delivered with a clean sweep, nailing all six games.

Breaking it down by individual ballots, we had one perfect picker on the panel in the wild-card round, and four cards went 5-1. Interestingly, all four picked a different loser, so there was no upset that universally rocked the group.

No. 6 Buffalo Bills (12-5, 1-0 playoffs) at No. 1 Denver Broncos (14-3)

Kickoff: 4:30 p.m. ET Saturday, CBS

Expert picks: Broncos 7, Bills 4

Bills quarterback Josh Allen unleashed another dominant performance in a 27-24 victory against the Jaguars, completing 28-of-35 passes for 273 yards and a touchdown, to go along with 33 rushing yards and two scores. He bailed out the defense by rallying twice for fourth-quarter touchdowns to set up a playoff meeting with the Broncos for the second year in a row.

“Superman is coming out,” an executive said.

But Allen hit the injury tent twice against the Jaguars, first for a concussion evaluation and then for a potential leg injury. Allen will play and more than likely be fine, but there are concerns about the accumulation of wear and tear, as it’ll impact the Bills’ championship aspirations.

Plus, the Bills have compiled injuries later this season, and their depth has taken a hit. Can Allen continue to play to a perfect standard to carry them into another round? That’s the panel’s greatest concern.

“The Bills have too many injuries to overcome at this point,” a second exec said. “I thought the quarterback wasn’t going to make it out of the first half of that (Jaguars) game.”

The Broncos need to control the game on the ground. Their 16th-ranked rushing attack wasn’t overly electric this season, but they should have success against the Bills’ No. 28 rush defense. And if Bo Nix can have more success with designed runs than Trevor Lawrence did, it’d further test the Bills’ vulnerable front.

“That stadium is tough,” a third executive said of Empower Field at Mile High. “The Broncos defense is nasty, and the Broncos offense should be able to run the ball. It may be close, but the Broncos are a fourth-quarter team, and so are the Bills. So it should be fun.”

The Broncos have won 13 of 14, and they’re rested. Their defense ranked third in points allowed and second in yards, and their 68 sacks easily set the pace — 11 more than any other team and 20 more than any other playoff team.

Allen should be able to attack the middle of Denver’s defense, though, and the Bills can ride rushing champion James Cook to control the game. Allen was efficient in last year’s playoff blowout, and Cook tallied 120 of the Bills’ 210 rushing yards in that game.

No. 6 San Francisco 49ers (12-5, 1-0) at No. 1 Seattle Seahawks (14-3)

Kickoff: 8 p.m. ET Saturday, Fox

Expert picks: Seahawks 6, 49ers 3

Both teams have declared they wanted this rematch, and now they’ve got it.

Not too surprisingly, the panelists felt strongly about the Seahawks two weeks after they dismantled the 49ers 13-3 in San Francisco with the NFC’s top seed on the line. Niners quarterback Brock Purdy was held without a touchdown for the only time this season, while running back Christian McCaffrey’s 57 yards from scrimmage were a season-low and just the fifth time he didn’t hit the century mark.

The Niners played without left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall in that matchup, but Williams has since returned, and Pearsall appears to be close to returning, as well. Linebacker Fred Warner won’t play after dislocating his ankle in October and tight end George Kittle is out with a torn Achilles. The injuries have been a continuous story for the Niners.

“No Kittle hurts,” an executive said of the star tight end who caught five of Purdy’s 19 completions in the teams’ Week 18 matchup.

“The 49ers are just so banged up,” another executive said.

Fun fact: The Niners have won exactly two playoff games in each of their last six postseason appearances, with four of those under coach Kyle Shanahan. They’ve won back-to-back road games in two of those postseasons, so they have precedent on their side.

The Seahawks will have a full-throated home-field advantage, though, with this being their first playoff game in front of fans in nine years. (Their last home playoff game was in January 2021, following the COVID-19 season.) Their victory against the Niners in the finale wasn’t just vital for the standings, as they also erased the sour taste of losing seven of their previous eight games to their NFC West rivals.

Offensively, the Seahawks ranked third in scoring and eighth in total yards, but their 28 turnovers were the second most in the NFL and five more than any other playoff team. They led the league with 13 lost fumbles.

Quarterback Sam Darnold had the second-best season of his career and helped wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba lead the league with 1,793 receiving yards, but Darnold’s 14 interceptions were also his second most.

“Darnold will be the X-factor either way,” said a coach who picked the Seahawks. “His play determines the outcome of the game.”

While Darnold and the offense are capable of exploding at any given moment, the Seahawks will go as far as their defense will carry them. Coach Mike Macdonald, who will make his playoff debut, helped the Seahawks lead the league in points allowed for the first time since 2012-15. They also ranked third against the run, sixth in takeaways (25) and tied for seventh in sacks (47).

“Seattle’s defense is nasty, nasty,” an executive said.

The 49ers had 22 regular-season giveaways, two interceptions in their 23-19 victory against the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round and fumbled twice (recovering both), so ball security has a chance to be the major story of this game.

No. 5 Houston Texans (12-5, 1-0) at No. 2 New England Patriots (14-3, 1-0)

Kickoff: 3 p.m. ET Sunday, ABC/ESPN

Expert picks: Patriots 7, Texans 3

The Patriots have awoken from a half-decade hibernation and are set to host the hottest team in the league, which boasts a ferocious defense and just won a playoff game for the third year in a row. The Texans might have sent Aaron Rodgers into retirement in the process.

And yet, the panelists were primarily focused on one man: Patriots quarterback Drake Maye.

“The way Drake is playing — other than this past week, I don’t think Drake is going to have two in a row like that,” an executive said. “That’s a really tough place to play. I don’t know if the Texans are going to run the ball and possess it enough to keep Drake Maye off the field.”

The Texans are riding a 10-game winning streak, and they’ve scored 30 or more points in four of those games. However, quarterback C.J. Stroud and the offense haven’t been the most consistent group, and wide receiver Nico Collins is in the concussion protocol. Furthermore, they finished 22nd in rushing yards and 29th in yards per carry this season, so they don’t help Stroud on the ground.

But the defense scored five times in the regular season and twice more in the 30-6 victory against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the wild-card round. The Texans forced 29 regular-season turnovers, third most in the NFL.

“This is the best team the Patriots have seen,” a second executive said.

The Patriots’ .391 strength of schedule was easily the worst in the league, but they can redirect that narrative by taking down the Texans, who are 5-1 against playoff opponents since Week 8.

Both quarterbacks are coming off games with uncharacteristically poor ball security. Stroud threw an interception and fumbled five times, losing two, against the Steelers. But Stroud only fumbled twice all season and didn’t lose one until the playoff game. He also cut down on his interceptions from 12 in 2024 (on 2.3 percent of his throws) to eight this season (1.9 percent of throws).

“Stroud will take care of the football,” the second executive said.

Maye threw a pick during the Patriots’ 16-3 victory against the Los Angeles Chargers, and he also fumbled twice, losing one. That’s a little more explainable with the five sacks. But Maye also cut down on his interceptions from 10 as a rookie (3 percent of throws) to eight in 2025 (1.6 percent). He lost three fumbles during the season.

A defensive coordinator pointed toward Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels’ historical success against the Texans’ defensive scheme. The coach predicted McDaniels would neutralize the Texans’ explosive edge rushers to allow Maye to play the game on his terms.

Eventually, an executive predicted, the Patriots will generate too much offensive pressure for Houston to withstand if its own offense isn’t doing enough.

“The Texans’ running game isn’t there,” the executive said. “You want to have faith in that defense, but I don’t trust the offense to take enough pressure off them.”

No. 5 Los Angeles Rams (12-5, 1-0) at No. 2 Chicago Bears (11-6, 1-0)

Kickoff: 6:30 p.m. ET Sunday, NBC

Expert picks: Rams 9, Bears 2

If this becomes a quarterback duel, Caleb Williams will have a hard time matching Matthew Stafford’s consistency. Then again, Williams has unquestionably been at his best in the most dire circumstances because of his athleticism and extraordinary arm talent.

That’s just a tough way to live in the playoffs.

“The Rams will get a lead, then the pass rushers will start getting after Caleb, and they have the speed to chase him down,” an executive said.

Edge rushers Byron Young (12 sacks), Jared Verse (7.5) and Kobie Turner (seven) lead the way for the Rams, who ranked seventh during the season with 47 sacks.

Williams has understandably generated the most attention, but the Bears’ offensive identity is through their physicality within their running game. They were third in rushing offense with D’Andre Swift (1,087 yards, nine touchdowns) and Kyle Monangai (783 yards, five touchdowns) leading the way. The Rams have been susceptible to the run at times this season.

Stafford, an MVP candidate, has thrown multiple touchdown passes in 16 of his 18 starts this season, including the last 12. The Rams led the league in points for the first time since 2017, and a couple of panelists believe Rams coach Sean McVay has a steep advantage against Chicago’s defense.

“I don’t trust the Bears defense,” an executive said. “I don’t know that they’re ready for a big game yet.”

Turnovers could be the key in this game, too. The Bears finished a league-best plus-22 in the turnover department this season, with the Rams ranking fifth at plus-11. They both take it away, with the Bears No. 1 with 33 forced turnovers and the Rams at No. 5 with 26. And neither give it back, with the Bears also No. 1 with 11 giveaways and the Rams at No. 6 with just 15 turnovers.

A break in that pattern could be an X-factor. Another could be the Rams’ woeful special teams.

And by now, the Rams are well aware that the Bears seem to have nine lives. Williams had a league-high six fourth-quarter comebacks in the regular season, and he’s one-for-one in the playoffs. The Rams are 5-5 in one-possession games this season, including their 34-31 playoff victory against the Carolina Panthers, but they won’t be comfortable with a coin-flip finish against Williams and the cardiac Bears.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/14144418/0115_NFLInsiderPlayoffPredictions_Divisional-scaled-e1768419908652.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-16 20:00:34.368633

Running back Terrell Jennings and outside linebacker Harold Landry III have been assigned that game designation ahead of the Houston Texans matchup, as head coach Mike Vrabel announced during his final press conference of the week.

The Patriots opened Jennings’ 21-day window to return as preparations for the divisional round began. The sophomore running back had been placed on injured reserve following the bye week in December due to a concussion. Gonzalez aentered the NFL’s protocol late last weekend, yet the Pro Bowl cornerback has also since gone from a red non-contact jersey on Wednesday to a full participant for consecutive sessions.

As for the veteran sack leader off the edges for the AFC’s No. 2 seed, Landry has been managing a knee injury since late in the fall and was ruled out for back-to-back games to end the regular season. He was a non-participant on Friday.

“We’re just trying to do everything we can to give him enough time to see how it feels for Sunday,” Vrabel said of the defensive captain, who started and stayed in for 26 snaps in the wild card after finishing 2025 with 8.5 sacks, 10 tackles for loss and 19 quarterback hits.

Elsewhere, corner Alex Austin, recently a full participant while working back from a wrist procedure, will go without a game status as the deadline for his activation to the 53-man roster nears with an open spot. And all-purpose nose tackle Khyiris Tonga also stands with the green light to face the Texans after missing the previous three games due to a foot injury.

“Great to have him practice, but what matters is what it’s going to be on Sunday at 3,” New England’s head coach said of Tonga. “I would say that hopefully he can pick up where he left off in his production and what he’s been able to do inside there as an interior, rotational player.”",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2255933305.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C78.543181364843&w=1200,N,,2026-01-16 19:03:18.793003

The league is coming off a truly wild Wild Card Weekend, with most games decided in the final moments, setting the stage for what's shaping up to be one of the most memorable postseason runs in recent memory. The bar is high for the divisional round -- and it has a lot to live up to.

As much as the focus is on the matchups that will determine who advances and who goes home, injuries are also looming large. Wild Card Weekend delivered plenty of drama, but it also took a toll. The 49ers lost tight end George Kittle for the remainder of the season with a torn Achilles, while Texans wide receiver Nico Collins and Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez each exited their games with concussions. Meanwhile, the Seahawks are keeping a close eye on Sam Darnold after he suffered an oblique injury during practice.

These teams met in Week 18 in what was a battle for the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs. It ended up in a dominant display for the Seahawks' defense as they stalled the 49ers' offense en route to a 13-3 victory.

That win ensured Seattle had last week off during the wild-card weekend. Now, they're back in action for the divisional round on Jan. 17.

San Francisco upset host Philadelphia last weekend thanks to some trickery on offense and standout performances by veterans on defense. They're on the road once again for this one.

This week marks the first playoff game for Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold since last year's wild-card round when he and the Minnesota Vikings lost to the Los Angeles Rams. The Rams' defense rattled Darnold with nine sacks in that one.

Darnold will look to change that narrative in the playoffs against his former team. He's 2-1 against the 49ers since spending the 2023 NFL season in San Francisco.

But he popped up on the injury report this week with an oblique issue. Here's the latest on his status for the divisional playoffs:

Is Sam Darnold playing against the 49ers?

The Seahawks quarterback explained what happened and why he ended up on the injury report during a Jan. 15 press conference. His response indicates he'll be on the field for the Seahawks-49ers game.

""Kind of just felt a little something on that oblique, just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said today. ""Wasn't the day to push it so that was it. So I just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold didn't shine against the 49ers when they faced off three weeks ago but played well enough to earn the win. He finished 20-for-26 passing for 198 yards.

In 12 regular-season games, he reeled in 44 passes for 661 yards and 6 touchdowns.

Notably, the Bears didn’t list injury designations for fellow WR DJ Moore, DB C.J. Gardner-Johnson and LT Braxton Jones.

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold has been added to the injury report with an oblique issue that makes him “questionable” for Saturday’s divisional-round playoff game versus the San Francisco 49ers, but he told reporters Thursday that he still expects to play.

He was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play against the 49ers this weekend at Seattle's Lumen Field.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Houston Texans wide receiver Nico Collins remains in concussion protocol and missed Thursday’s media session, according to the Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander.

Collins is unlikely to play in Sunday’s divisional round game against the New England Patriots because of the steps needed to clear concussion protocol.

Collins suffered the concussion in Monday’s wild-card 30-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins had 3 catches for 21 yards in the game before going down.

If Collins cannot go, expect Christian Kirk, Jayden Higgins, and Dalton Schultz to see an increase in targets. Jaylin Noel, Xavier Hutchinson and Cade Stover could also see an increased role.

The Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos are back in action after a first-round bye last week, and each team faces a tough task as they host the San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills, respectively. The Houston Texans head to New England for a date with the Patriots on Sunday after these teams knocked off the Pittsburgh Steelers and Los Angeles Chargers, respectively, and the weekend concludes with the Chicago Bears hosting the Los Angeles Rams after each team won a close one last week. Some teams are looking much better in the injury department than others entering the Divisional Round, so here, we break down the top injuries bettors should know before placing wagers, and also share the latest NFL betting odds from DraftKings Sportsbook.

Buffalo Bills at Denver Broncos (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)

BUFF LB Terrel Bernard (calf, questionable)

BUFF DT Ed Oliver (biceps, questionable)

BUFF S Jordan Poyer (hamstring, out)

BUFF CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle, out)

BUFF RB Ty Johnson (ankle, questionable)

BUFF WR Curtis Samuel (elbow, questionable)

BUFF WR Tyrell Shavers (knee, out)

BUFF WR Gabe Davis (knee, out)

If you want to see the difference a first-round bye makes, look no further than this matchup. Buffalo is beat up on both sides of the ball, with linebacker Terrel Bernard and questionable and safety Jordan Poyer out. Rookie cornerback Maxwell Hairston is also out. Offensively, receivers Tyrell Shavers and Gabe Davis each suffered torn ACLs last week, while No. 2 back Ty Johnson aims to return to Buffalo's backfield. The Bills activated defensive tackle Ed Oliver and receiver Curtis Samuel from injured reserve, giving the team a likely boost on both sides of the ball. Both are officially questionable to suit up.

Denver is a 1.5-point favorite here, and the total is 45.5.

San Francisco 49ers at Seattle Seahawks (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)

SF TE George Kittle (Achilles, out)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)

SF Fred Warner (ankle, out)

SEA QB Sam Darnold (oblique, questionable)

It's always a concern when a player surprisingly pops up on the final injury report, and it's especially noteworthy when it's your starting quarterback. That's the case for Seattle's Sam Darnold, however, as he is questionable with an oblique injury. Darnold told reporters he ""felt a little something"" during practice on Thursday but that he expects to play on Saturday. Head coach Mike Macdonald told reporters Friday he expects his starting quarterback to suit up as well. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is out for the rest of the postseason with a torn Achilles, veteran linebacker Fred Warner won't be activated and second-year receiver Ricky Pearsall is questionable due to a nagging knee injury.

Seattle is a 7-point favorite at home. The total is 45.5.

Houston Texans at New England Patriots (3 p.m. ET, Sunday)

HOU WR Nico Collins (concussion, out)

NE CB Christian Gonzalez (concussion, will play)

The Texans' offense has been limited at times throughout the year, but it always had one constant in star receiver Nico Collins. That unit will not have Collins in this pivotal matchup with the Patriots, however, as he's out with a concussion he suffered in last week's win over the Steelers. With Collins out, Houston's more unproven receivers like Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel will have to step up as primary targets for C.J. Stroud. Making things harder is star cornerback Christian Gonzalez has cleared concussion protocol for New England and will play.

The Patriots are 3-point favorites, and the total is 40.5 -- the lowest of this four-game slate.

Los Angeles Rams at Chicago Bears (6:30 p.m. ET, Sunday)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, questionable)

The Rams are in a good spot when it comes to the health department, and the biggest injury news for the Bears is that second-year receiver Rome Odunze is questionable with a foot injury that cost him considerable time this year. Odunze played last week and told reporters he expects to suit up against the Rams.

The Rams are 3.5-point road favorites. The total is 45.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/11/05/1f5e9b03-72ba-4edb-b674-94a8b1338ef9/thumbnail/1200x675/5c3eb62bcf7a4a9c3901d7c4349e43c4/sam-darnold-seahawks.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 19:03:29.512599

Although veteran WR Mack Hollins (abdomen) remains on injured reserve, the Patriots didn't rule any players on their active roster out on their final injury report. On Friday, New England listed OLB Harold Landry III (knee), and RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) as questionable for Sunday's divisional round matchup vs. the Texans.

Starting with the defense, Pro Bowl CB Christian Gonzalez was cleared to play and is off the injury report after being in concussion protocol this week. Gonzalez exited last Sunday's Wild Card win over the Chargers in the fourth quarter after he appeared to injure himself breaking up a pass earlier in the quarter. Gonzalez did not return to the game and was placed in the league's concussion protocol. During the week, the star cornerback practiced on Wednesday in a red non-contact jersey and then shed the red jersey as a full participant in the final two practices, indicating that he's trending in the right direction.

Gonzalez spent most of last week's matchup covering Chargers deep threat Quentin Johnston, breaking up both passes intended for Johnston. In all, Gonzalez didn't allow a catch on five targets vs. Los Angeles. As one of the best cornerbacks in the league, Gonzalez allows the Patriots to increase the blitz pressure because they trust their corners on islands. Last week, New England blitzed Chargers QB Justin Herbert on 45.5% of his drop-backs, pressuring him nine times. Texans QB C.J. Stroud ranks 17th in expected points added per drop-back against the blitz, so the Patriots might continue to heat up Houston's quarterback on Sunday afternoon with all their cornerbacks healthy.

Along with Gonzalez trending toward being available, the Patriots defense and short-yardage offense could get a big boost from the return of NT Khyiris Tonga. Tonga, who hasn't played since injuring his foot in Week 16, returned to practice this week. The big nose tackle is a stout run-stopper who registered 12 run stuffs this season and shows impressive power to dent the pocket as a bull rusher. Plus, the 335-pound defender has played 14 snaps on offense this season as a short-yardage blocker.

The Patriots have gotten pretty creative with Tonga on offense, moving him around to create advantageous blocking angles in the run game. One of the Texans defense's many strengths is its ability to stop the run (third in rush EPA), particularly in short-yardage situations, where Houston ranks fifth in power success rate (59.5%). Tonga could help the Patriots offense get those tough yards when they're in power situations.

The final puzzle piece on defense is the status of captain Harold Landry III, who has been managing a knee injury for the last several weeks. After resting his knee in the last two regular season games, Landry returned for the Wild Card win over the Chargers but didn't register any pressures in just 26 snaps. If the captain doesn't play, New England will likely lean on Anfernee Jennings and Elijah Ponder on the edge opposite K'Lavon Chaisson, while new addition Derrell Taylor is a candidate to be a practice squad elevation.

Moving over to the offense, the Patriots mostly have a clean bill of health. The only question mark was jumbo tight end/third tackle Thayer Munford Jr., who has been dealing with a knee injury over the last few weeks. Munford played through the injury last week, so one would expect him to play on Sunday. The jumbo package could be a big part of New England's game plan. With six offensive linemen on the field, the Patriots can load up protections to get multiple blockers on the Texans elite pass rushers. Houston ranks just 21st in pass EPA against jumbo packages, compared to first against regular personnel groupings. Therefore, one would expect the Patriots offense to test the Texans pass defense in jumbo packages.

As for the Texans, Houston ruled out star WR Nico Collins (concussion) after he exited their Wild Card win over the Steelers. Collins led the Texans with 1,117 receiving yards in the regular season, tied for ninth in the NFL, and also hauled in six touchdowns. This season, the Texans average nearly a full yard per play more with Collins on the field (5.6) versus off the field (4.8), so that's a major blow to Houston's offense. After not practicing the first two days, RT Trent Brown (ankle) is officially questionable.

New England also has the option to activate RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) and CB Alex Austin (wrist) from injured reserve, with both players practicing this week. The Patriots created an open roster spot by releasing veteran RB D'Ernest Johnson, who re-signed with the team's practice squad, which would suggest they might activate Jennings as their third running back. At cornerback, the Pats must activate Austin this week or his 21-day window to return from injured reserve will close, shutting him down for the rest of the season. Most likely, that'll come down to whether the Patriots prefer Austin over rookie DB Kobee Minor on special teams.

New England has until Saturday at 4 p.m. ET to activate Austin and Jennings from injured reserve, while the team can also use its two standard practice squad elevations for Sunday's game. We will keep you updated on all the moving parts on the roster. The Patriots will then host the Texans with kickoff at 3 p.m. ET at Gillette Stadium on Sunday.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/qez7daojcmdadpuzrmz4,N,,2026-01-16 18:02:46.231925

Warner was looking to play in the NFL Divisional Round this Saturday, but the hope was cut short Thursday, just two days before game time.

After suffering a fractured and dislocated right ankle in Week 6 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Warner looked like his season was over. But with successful surgery and an unheard-of recovery, he had a chance to play this week against division rival Seattle Seahawks on Saturday.

49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan expressed optimism that if the 49ers were to win this weekend, Warner could make one of the most historical comebacks from an injury that traditionally sets players back a full season.

When asked about the potential to play next week, Shanahan said that he was “confident in that” idea and mentioned that “we’ll see if it works out.”

Warner all week had videos at practice looking healthy and mobile, which left the door open to possibly play this weekend after his press conference Wednesday.

“I feel amazing,” Warner said in his interview with 49ersWebzone.com. Warner acknowledged that he was grateful to even be in a situation this close to coming back and that he was “grateful and blessed” for it.

Warner also expressed his gratitude for his supporters and the people that “have been in [Warner’s] corner the entire time.” Warner mentioned the “trainers, the strength staff, the plan they put together for [Warner], [and] helping push [Warner] along.”

Warner’s teammates also expressed the impact and the possible addition that he would be to the 49ers, with 12-time Pro Bowl offensive lineman Trent Williams saying how much even seeing Warner on the field provides motivation for Williams and the team.

“Just having his face in this locker room, it’s motivation,” Williams said. “The fact that Fred even has his jersey on, 100 days after what happened to him, that just uplifts the team whether Fred takes the field in these playoffs or not.”",https://brightspotcdn.byu.edu/dims4/default/d83d571/2147483647/strip/true/crop/440x440+171+0/resize/1200x1200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrigham-young-brightspot-us-east-2.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fae%2Fd8%2F23fc4d264bacb329ac19993e0dea%2Ffred-warner.jpeg,N,,2026-01-16 20:00:44.934468

Further complicating matters was an ankle injury to swing tackle Storm Norton, who was McGary's primary backup. The injury was initially expected to cost Norton only a portion of the season, but he never suited up for the Falcons in 2025. That left Atlanta to enter the season with veteran journeyman Elijah Wilkinson starting on Penix's blind side.

Wilkinson ended up playing every offensive snap for the Falcons in 2025, joining Ryan Neuzil as the only two players to do so. Even with a heavy reliance on two new faces in the starting lineup, Atlanta's offensive line was still a force to be reckoned with on the ground.

Let's take a closer look at how the group did.

Biggest question facing the position group in 2026:

How will Kaleb McGary bounce back from injury?

McGary's season-ending injury late in training camp was a setback for an offensive line group that has been remarkably consistent the last few years. And while Elijah Wilkinson performed well in his stead throughout the 2025 season, McGary's return should bolster the offense.

The former first-round pick is under contract for the next two seasons, and his abilities as a run blocker should be valued by whoever the Falcons' next head coach and general manager are. Given that McGary sustained his knee injury before the 2025 season started, he should be back up to full speed next fall.

His return would be a benefit to Atlanta's run game, which just featured a record-setting performance from Bijan Robinson. McGary's ability in the open field has and should continue to be an asset to the Falcons' outside zone attack, and he has improved as a pass protector since joining the team in 2019.

If McGary is back to form in 2026, the Falcons will once again have an offensive line that can set the tone for their offense.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/falcons/udnsjuodoaelvcylcwl5,N,,2026-01-16 19:03:33.795560

The Houston Texans defense had the most complete game of any unit last season. How can the New England Patriots move the ball against them?

We’ll look at the most important matchups on both sides of the ball in the AFC’s two divisional games this weekend.

Buffalo Bills at Denver Broncos (4:30 p.m. ET Saturday)

Key matchup: TE Dalton Kincaid vs. Broncos linebackers

From weeks 11 to 17 (the opposing Kansas City Chiefs rested starters in Week 18), the Broncos had a defensive drop-off, going from elite to very good. They still were a very disruptive defense in that span, leading the league in negative play rate (37.2 percent), but dropped to 10th in success rate (57.1 percent), 23rd in EPA per dropback (-0.13) and 21st in points per drive (2.25). Notably, they struggled against mobile quarterbacks. Marcus Mariota, Trevor Lawrence and Jordan Love, even though he doesn’t run as much, had success extending plays and scrambling against the Broncos.

Aside from Josh Allen’s ability to create off-script plays, there are a few ways the Bills offense matches up favorably against the Broncos defense. The Broncos defense specializes in taking away outside receivers with cornerbacks Patrick Surtain and Riley Moss, and of course, that will be an issue for the Bills, but they don’t rely on their outside receivers winning at a high rate to move the ball. The Bills rank fifth in receiving yards to tight ends and running backs.

In the playoff matchup with the Broncos last season, the Bills were able to run for 210 yards on a defense that ranked first in success rate that year. More importantly, they took advantage of the Broncos’ linebackers by targeting running backs and tight ends (seven catches for 101 yards). Dalton Kincaid has missed several games this season with injuries, but he’s improved as a player and should be a major part of the Bills’ game plan.

The Broncos have given up the ninth-most yards to tight ends this season and the eighth-highest average yards per reception to tight ends (10.7). They major in man coverage, but their linebackers don’t play man coverage at a high level. Dre Greenlaw should help, but he’s a better zone defender. Strong safety Talanoa Hufanga is elite in so many areas but weak in man coverage as well.

The Bills should have a similar game plan to last year’s playoff game and target Kincaid. We could even see running back Ty Johnson run some routes against the linebackers.

Key matchup: Bills defensive coordinator Bobby Babich vs. QB Bo Nix

Bills coach Sean McDermott and defensive coordinator Bobby Babich are doing their finest work this season with the defense. It has had injury issues upfront and is being pieced together by retread players such as 34-year-old safety Jordan Poyer and cornerback Tre’Davious White, who has a long injury history. But what they lack in athleticism, they make up for with knowledge of the system and savvy. The Bills are disguising at a high level and constantly breaking tendencies. It’s hard to get a bead on what they are doing with their pre-snap movement.

Trevor Lawrence and the Jacksonville Jaguars’ passing game were on a tear coming into the postseason. The Bills held them to 7 points in the first half, but Poyer was hurt late in the second quarter. Poyer’s injury limited what they could do from an exotic coverage standpoint, but with more practice time with his replacement, Jordan Hancock, the Bills should be able to crank the dial up with their disguises more.

6:48 remaining in the third quarter, first-and-10

Here, the Bills initially showed two-high coverage with both safeties sitting deep.

After the snap, Hancock rotated down, making it appear the defense had rotated into a one-high coverage. Lawrence thought he would have tight end Brenton Strange open down the seam, but the Bills actually rotated a different two-high coverage than the initial look. They played inverted Cover 2 toward Strange’s side, meaning White was playing a deep half rather than staying outside.

White was able to run underneath Strange and nearly pick off the pass.

Bo Nix has struggled against disguised coverages this season. According to Pro Football Focus, when Nix faced two-high switching to one-high coverage rotations, his EPA per dropback was -0.26. Against one-high switching to two-high coverage rotations, his EPA per dropback was -0.02. To put that in perspective, Tennessee Titans quarterback Cam Ward ranked 33rd in EPA per dropback among qualifying quarterbacks, and it was -0.15. Nix’s performance dips significantly against disguised coverages, and the Bills disguise on 40 percent of snaps (league average is 33 percent).

Although the point has been made ad nauseam, it’s imperative the Broncos run the ball efficiently and keep Nix out of third-and-long situations where the Bills can get exotic. The Bills have statistically one of the worst run defenses in the league all season, but they’ve had some spike games when some of their run blitzes and line games hit home. The Jaguars did a good job using motion to displace them, and their running backs ran for 121 yards on 15 carries (8 yards per carry). They should have run the ball more.

The Broncos rank 12th in rushing success rate and explosive run rate. They are better than average at running the ball, but I’m not sure I’d trust them to dominate and completely take the ball out of Nix’s hands. If the game becomes a high-scoring one and they get into a passing script, how Nix can decipher the Bills’ disguised coverages will be key.

Houston Texans at New England Patriots (3 p.m. ET Sunday)

Key matchup: RB Rhamondre Stevenson vs. LB Henry To’oTo’o

Last week, for the Steelers-Texans game, I highlighted Pittsburgh running back Kenneth Gainwell’s matchup with Houston linebacker Henry To’oTo’o, who is a hyperaggressive player against the run but can struggle against the pass. Gainwell ended up converting six targets for four catches and 26 yards. He led the Steelers in catches and was tied for second in receiving yards. He was a big part of the Steelers’ game plan. He was open on several plays and dropped a pass, but ultimately, he had to chip the Texans’ ends on too many plays and couldn’t free release.

There aren’t many weaknesses in the Texans defense, and they have matchup advantages across the board against the New England Patriots’ pass catchers. Running back Rhamondre Stevenson had his most productive game as a receiver last week against the Los Angeles Chargers, catching three passes for 75 yards. Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels is one of the best at drawing up plays for pass-catching running backs.

The Patriots offensive line struggled to block the Chargers’ pass rush. The Texans’ pass rush is on an entirely different tier. Quarterback Drake Maye is going to have to get rid of the ball quickly. Quick passes to Stevenson or TreVeyon Henderson running routes against To’oTo’o should be an effective tool on early downs.

Key matchup: DT Milton Williams vs. Texans interior O-line

Milton Williams, one of the Patriots’ best defenders, missed all of December with a high ankle sprain. He came back for the final game of the season, and although he still hasn’t quite looked like himself, he flashed against the Chargers, sacking Justin Herbert twice.

The Chargers have arguably the worst offensive line in football, and there were quite a few plays in which Williams wasn’t disruptive. But maybe being another week removed from his injury and two games under his belt to get into game shape, we’ll see the Williams who was dominant at the beginning of the season.

The Texans don’t have an explosive run game, but they’ve become an efficient running team after making Woody Marks the lead back and getting more entrenched in first-year offensive coordinator Nick Caley’s scheme. Against the Steelers in the wild-card round, the Texans rushed for 164 yards, averaging 5.3 yards per carry. The Texans are a below-average pass-blocking team, and their offense was able to turn the corner when they started reducing the rate at which they faced third-and-long situations.

Before Williams was hurt in Week 11, the Patriots ranked eighth in defensive rushing success rate. In the six games he missed, they ranked 31st. The Patriots need Williams to be a stalwart for their run defense against a Texans offense that wants to run the ball on early downs and reduce risk.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/15212419/USATSI_25173167-scaled-e1768530292662.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-16 19:03:37.303706

Moore is clear to play this win-or-go-home contest at Soldier Field. There is some uncertainly, however around Odunze. He received a questionable designation on the official Bears injury report, which the team released on Friday afternoon. He has said he’s going to give it a go on Sunday.

He returned from a five week absence for the Packers game and made a huge fourth-down catch, but he’s clearly not playing at maximum warp. This is the playoffs ,and he’s willing to deal with the pain in his foot in order to play.

“I don’t know if I can put a percentage on it, with what I’m going through,” Odunze said on Thursday. “I obviously wouldn’t say 100 but, at the end of the day, I’m good enough to go.”

Linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin was also questionable with a back injury.

A relatively light injury report doesn’t mean, however, that the Bears came out of their NFC wild-card round win over Green Bay healthy. They lost two every-down starters in that a game, major blows to their future playoff prospects. Linebacker T.J. Edwards suffered a fractured fibula and is done for the postseason. So is left tackle Ozzy Trapilo, who ruptured his patellar tendon late in the game. Both guys were moved to injured reserve earlier this week.

D’Marco Jackson is set to step in for Edwards, as he did last week, and Theo Benedet should take over for Trapilo. Veteran left tackle Braxton Jones was activated on injured reserve earlier this week and should be a backup.

Defensive back C.J. Gardner-Johnson will return after missing the wild-card game while in the concussion protocol. He has cleared it now and will return to the field in what will likely be split duty with Kyler Gordon in the slot, tough Gardner-Johnson alluded to the prospect of them playing together in the dime package.

Experts weigh in on 'crackpot' theory,Evan Webeck,,,,,https://www.mercurynews.com/2026/01/16/49ers-injuries-power-plant-theory-electromagnetic-waves/,"The low-frequency electromagnetic waves produced by a power plant neighboring Levi’s Stadium are apparently to blame for the 49ers’ injury woes, a recent viral social media thread alleges.
“There is definitely at least basic science research that suggests electromagnetic fields can potentially help healing,” Pandya said.
The theory, which claims “low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage,” has spread as far as the Niners locker room.
Wide receiver Kendrick Bourne quipped recently, “Yeah, it’s that power plant,” when he was asked about the toll of the team’s trouble staying healthy.
The city considered moving the power plant when Levi’s Stadium was constructed but opted only to reconfigure it at the same location.","The list of players who have ended up on the injured reserve in recent years is so long, so star-studded that the San Francisco 49ers faithful have had it.

They’ve resorted to online conspiracy theories.

The low-frequency electromagnetic waves produced by a power plant neighboring Levi’s Stadium are apparently to blame for the 49ers’ injury woes, a recent viral social media thread alleges. There is, in fact, some basis to the idea that electromagnetic waves can affect the human body, explained Dr. Nirav Pandya.

As a sports orthopedic surgeon at UC San Francisco, he has used them before. To help treat injuries, ranging from rotator cuff tears to bone fractures.

“There is definitely at least basic science research that suggests electromagnetic fields can potentially help healing,” Pandya said. “Unless you’re sitting in a lab and overexposing yourself, the (idea) that it would be detrimental and affect an entire team would be pretty remarkable.”

That is, however, precisely the premise of an idea that has taken hold among fans — and some players — of one of the NFL’s most injury-riddled teams.

After George Kittle became the latest 49ers star to see his season ended by injury, tearing his Achilles in their wild-card round win at Philadelphia, a post on the social media site X tying the team’s injury woes to a “massive electrical substation” next to their stadium and practice fields gained traction. It echoed a post from another user in October that was quickly shot down.

As of this writing, the post by Peter Cowan, a wellness entrepreneur with about 6,000 followers and a Substack blog, had been seen by 22 million users, garnered 35,000 likes and been reposted more than 5,800 times. He previously used the profile mostly to promote his app that hails the healing properties of sunlight.

The theory, which claims “low-frequency electromagnetic fields can degrade collagen, weaken tendons, and cause soft-tissue damage,” has spread as far as the Niners locker room. Wide receiver Kendrick Bourne quipped recently, “Yeah, it’s that power plant,” when he was asked about the toll of the team’s trouble staying healthy.

What “scares” Dr. Michael Hoff isn’t whether Cowan is right or wrong, he said, “I think crazy theories are fine. … But like, the fact that the rest of the world kind of goes, ‘Oh, maybe that’s true.’ That’s a scary thing. But that’s more about the internet.”

As the director of diagnostic medical physics in UCSF’s radiology department, Hoff called the idea “very, very crackpot” but he added, “That’s not to say something that hasn’t been proven doesn’t exist.”

Huff identified two “huge jumps” Cowan makes in his claim.

First, he questioned Cowan’s method of measurement. The earth’s magnetic field ranges from 250-650 milligauss (mG). Cowan uses a device that recorded a reading of around 8.5-9.0 mG above normal from the perimeter of the Niners practice facility, a hundred yards or so from the power plant. That amounts to a “tiny, tiny little extra amount of magnetic field,” Hoff said.

“Second of all, even if you multiplied it by a million and centered it in Levi’s Stadium, would it even damage tissue? There’s no evidence of that, either.”

According to the World Health Organization, “most scientists and clinicians agree that any health effects of low-level electromagnetic fields, if they exist at all, are likely to be very small compared to other health risks that people face in everyday life.”

Dr. Joel Moskowitz, a UC Berkeley researcher who serves on the International Commission on the Biological Effects of Electromagnetic Fields, acknowledged that the theory laid out by Cowan is “not the most likely risk factor” to the 49ers’ injuries but wasn’t willing to write it off.

“I believe there is some credence to this theory,” he said. “Conventional wisdom is that none of this stuff can harm you, but that’s just BS in my point of view.”

While the EPA states “scientific studies have not consistently shown whether exposure to any source of EMF increases cancer risk,” Moskowitz cited a study that found increased leukemia risk in children at exposures as low as 4.0 mG and pointed to a meta-analysis of 345 studies since 1990 that found “significant adverse effects from exposure to … extremely low frequency and static electromagnetic fields.”

Most of the work, however, pertains to cancer risk. There is less evidence to back up Cowan’s claim that “the magnetic fields pouring out of the substation … trigger a multi-pathway assault on collagen,” weakening tendons and soft tissue.

Injury data does back up what we’ve seen with our own eyes: The Niners have been one of the least-healthy teams in the NFL. According to Sports Info Solutions’ analysis, only the Cardinals and Commanders were more impacted by injuries this season. Dating back to 2016, the year before Kyle Shanahan was hired as head coach, the 49ers’ 1,970 cumulative games lost on IR are the most in the NFL, according to analysis TruMedia conducted for SFGate.

However, when San Francisco made the Super Bowl in 2023-24, it was one of the league’s healthiest teams. And some of the team’s most serious losses, whether it be Fred Warner’s broken ankle or Brock Purdy’s turf toe, “have nothing to do with collagen or soft tissue,” Pandya, the orthopedic surgeon, said. “It’s football. It’s violent.”

Shanahan’s smash-mouth style on offense — and a defense focused on reacting and tackling at maximum effort — is one reason some have speculated could lead to injury. Players themselves cited turf issues at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium for a game that saw two 49ers tear their ACLs. San Francisco ranked eighth overall out of 32 teams on the NFL Players’ Association’s latest satisfaction survey, but its training room and training staff received the worst marks, both among the bottom third in the league.

The substation, which is owned and operated by Silicon Valley Power, has been there since 1986, three years before the team moved its headquarters and practice facility to the same site. The city considered moving the power plant when Levi’s Stadium was constructed but opted only to reconfigure it at the same location.

Former 49ers Jon Feliciano and Taybor Pepper have said the nearby substation had been a topic of discussion in the locker room long before Cowan’s post on Jan. 6, and Bourne made it clear that the current group has at least seen the recent discourse online. The Washington Post surveyed about two dozen NFL agents this week, roughly one-third of whom reported hearing concerns from their clients about the power plant.

With an NFC divisional playoff showdown set for Saturday in Seattle, the 49ers will be without Kittle, All-Pro defensive end Nick Bosa and in all likelihood Warner, in addition to a handful of other onetime starters. At least wide receiver Ricky Pearsall, who missed last week’s game with a nagging PCL strain, is trending toward returning against the Seahawks.

As for the unlikely explanation for why the 49ers will be so undermanned, the organization declined to weigh in. The City of Santa Clara, which owns Silicon Valley Power, did not respond to requests for comment.

“It’s just so hard to make the argument that this is the sole reason why they have more injuries,” Pandya said of the substation theory. “Particularly when there’s not even basic science data that suggests that this level of exposure could cause it.”",https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BNG-L-49ERS-0112-4.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-16 17:04:13.930067

Several key starters and important depth players for the Saturday match-up are either sidelined or fighting through lingering issues. These injury reports give a clearer picture of who will be available and how each team may need to adjust its game plan.

Buffalo Bills

Maxwell Hairston – CB (Ankle) – OUT

Hairston injured his ankle late in the regular season and was unable to return to practice this week, leading to his official ruling out. The injury likely occurred in coverage when he was forced to plant and change direction, a common mechanism for ankle sprains in defensive backs. His absence removes a rotational corner and forces Buffalo to lean more heavily on younger or less experienced depth in sub-packages, which could be tested by Denver’s outside receivers.

Jordan Poyer – S (Hamstring) – OUT

Poyer’s hamstring injury has lingered, and the team opted not to push him in a short playoff week. Hamstring strains are especially problematic for safeties, as their role requires repeated sprinting, sudden stops, and lateral movement. Without Poyer, the Bills lose a key communicator and stabilizing presence in the secondary, increasing the risk of coverage busts and reducing reliability in run support.

Ty Johnson – RB (Ankle) – QUESTIONABLE

Johnson tweaked his ankle during late-season action and has been limited in practice, creating uncertainty about his availability and workload. An ankle injury can limit explosion and cutting ability, which are critical to his role as a change-of-pace back. If he is inactive or limited, Buffalo’s backfield rotation tightens, putting more pressure on the starters and reducing flexibility in pass protection and screen concepts.

Curtis Samuel – WR (Elbow) – QUESTIONABLE

Samuel has been dealing with an elbow issue that surfaced in practice and has restricted his reps. Elbow injuries can affect both catching reliability and willingness to engage in contact over the middle. If Samuel cannot go or is limited, the Bills lose a versatile weapon who is often used on jet motion, short crossers, and gadget plays, shrinking the playbook and making the offense easier to predict.

Ed Oliver – DT (Biceps) – QUESTIONABLE

Oliver suffered a biceps strain, most likely while engaging blockers in the trenches, and his participation has been limited. For an interior defensive lineman, arm strength and leverage are essential, and a compromised biceps can significantly reduce effectiveness. If Oliver is limited or out, Buffalo’s interior pass rush suffers, giving Denver’s quarterback more room to step up in the pocket.

Terrel Bernard – LB (Calf) – QUESTIONABLE

Bernard is dealing with calf tightness, an injury that often arises from overuse or sudden acceleration. Calf injuries can linger and limit range of motion, particularly in lateral pursuit. His potential absence would thin Buffalo’s linebacker rotation and weaken coverage against tight ends and running backs in the short passing game.

Damar Hamlin – S (Pectoral) – QUESTIONABLE

Hamlin injured his pectoral muscle, typically the result of contact or tackling impact, and has been limited in practice. A pectoral injury can affect tackling strength and ability to engage blockers. If he is limited or unable to go, Buffalo loses depth and physicality at safety, which could be exposed in Denver’s run game and play-action concepts.

Denver Broncos

Krull suffered a foot injury and was unable to practice, leading to his designation as out. Foot injuries for tight ends are especially challenging given the position’s dual blocking and receiving responsibilities. His absence reduces Denver’s depth in heavy packages and limits their ability to rotate tight ends to keep players fresh in the run game.

Drew Sanders – LB (Ankle) – OUT

Sanders injured his ankle, likely in traffic or while changing direction in pursuit, and has not been able to return. Ankle injuries significantly affect a linebacker’s ability to fill gaps and drop into coverage. Without Sanders, Denver loses athleticism and flexibility at the second level, which could be problematic against Buffalo’s spread formations and running back routes.

San Francisco 49ers

Ji’Ayir Brown – S (Hamstring) – OUT

Brown strained his hamstring, an injury commonly sustained during sprinting or sudden acceleration in coverage. Hamstrings are notoriously slow to heal and easily re-aggravated, making it risky to rush a player back. His absence reduces San Francisco’s flexibility in sub-packages and places more responsibility on the remaining safeties to handle deep coverage and run support.

Fred Warner – LB (Ankle) – OUT

Warner’s ankle injury is a major blow, as he is the emotional leader and on-field quarterback of the defense. The injury likely occurred in traffic or while planting to change direction, and the team has chosen not to risk further damage. Without Warner, the 49ers lose elite range, diagnostic ability, and communication in the middle of the defense, which can lead to misalignments and softer coverage against tight ends and crossing routes.

Jacob Cowing – WR (Hamstring) – QUESTIONABLE

Cowing is managing a hamstring issue that limited his practice reps throughout the week. As a speed-based receiver, any hamstring tightness directly impacts his effectiveness and ability to separate. If he cannot play, the 49ers lose a vertical and motion threat, narrowing the spacing of the offense and making coverage assignments easier for Seattle.

Luke Gifford – LB (Quadriceps) – QUESTIONABLE

Gifford is dealing with a quad injury, typically caused by overextension or direct contact. Quadriceps injuries can reduce power and burst, which are critical for special teams and rotational linebacker duties. If he is limited or inactive, San Francisco’s depth in the linebacker room becomes even thinner with Warner already out.

Ricky Pearsall – WR (Knee) – QUESTIONABLE

Pearsall has knee soreness that has restricted his workload in practice. Knee issues can affect cutting, route precision, and confidence when planting. If he cannot go or is limited, the 49ers lose another young receiver in the rotation, putting more pressure on the starters and reducing flexibility in three- and four-receiver sets.

Dee Winters – LB (Ankle) – QUESTIONABLE

Winters is nursing an ankle injury that has limited his reps. Like Sanders in Denver, ankle injuries for linebackers can be especially problematic because of the need for lateral movement and sudden direction changes. If Winters is unavailable, San Francisco’s linebacker depth is stretched dangerously thin, increasing the risk of fatigue and missed assignments.

Seattle Seahawks

Elijah Arroyo – TE (Knee) – OUT

Arroyo suffered a knee injury that has kept him out of practice, leading to his designation as out. Knee injuries often affect stability and leverage, which are essential for tight ends in blocking situations. His absence reduces Seattle’s ability to run two-tight-end sets and limits options in the short and intermediate passing game.

Josh Jones – OL (Knee) – OUT

Jones injured his knee and will miss the game, forcing Seattle to reshuffle its offensive line. Knee injuries for linemen are particularly disruptive because they affect anchor strength and lateral movement. Without Jones, Seattle may be forced to start a backup or move personnel around, increasing the risk of protection breakdowns against San Francisco’s pass rush.

Chazz Surratt – LB (Ankle) – OUT

Surratt’s ankle injury has sidelined him for the Divisional Round. As with most linebacker ankle injuries, the concern is reduced mobility and ability to change direction. His absence weakens Seattle’s depth in the middle of the defense and puts more strain on the remaining linebackers to handle both run fits and coverage responsibilities.

Sam Darnold – QB (Oblique) – QUESTIONABLE

Darnold strained his oblique muscle, an injury often caused by rotational stress during throwing. Oblique injuries can affect throwing power, accuracy, and overall comfort in the pocket. Even if he plays, Seattle may limit the game plan to shorter throws and quicker reads, which could restrict the offense and make it easier for the 49ers’ defense to anticipate play calls.

Conclusion

In the playoffs, every absence is magnified, and even one missing player can change the tone of a game. Teams with better health and depth will have a clear advantage as the competition tightens. Ultimately, how well coaches adapt to these injuries could be the difference between moving on and going home.",https://www.thebiglead.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/USATSI_27927076_168396005_lowres.jpg,N,,2026-01-16 16:01:53.168981

That's really the biggest thing is we got to stay on the field so we can keep calling runs then hopefully, you can get the defense to commit another guy in the box, which helps other things.""

The 49ers are 7-1 since Purdy returned from injury that cut out the middle of his campaign. The only loss came in Week 18 to the Seahawks. From Weeks 11-17, he generated a 111.5 passer rating, but has just a 73.1 passer rating over his last two tilts versus Seattle and Philadelphia.

""It's going to take an exceptional effort on our part to give ourselves a chance,"" Bears defensive coordinator Dennis Allen said, via the Chicago Sun-Times.

""It's going to take an exceptional effort on our part to give ourselves a chance,"" Bears defensive coordinator Dennis Allen said, via the Chicago Sun-Times.

In the Rams' wild-card win over Carolina, Nacua and Adams combined for 15 catches, 183 receiving yards and a touchdown. Nacua posted 10 grabs for 111 yards and the score on 18 targets. Adams, in his first game back after missing three tilts with a hamstring injury, snagged just 5 of 13 targets but generated 72 yards.

Nacua is the key to the L.A. offense, leading the NFL with 129 catches in 2025 and finishing second in the league with 1,715 yards. The powerful wideout's ability to make contested catches, coupled with his run-after-catch ability, makes him a handful for any defense. The only time Nacua faced an Allen-led defense, in 2023 against the New Orleans Saints, he put up 164 yards and a TD on nine grabs.

""You come away from there thoroughly impressed,"" Allen said of Nacua. ""He runs as fast as he needs to to get the job done. He's big, he's physical. He catches everything that's remotely close to him and he's tremendous with the run after the catch. I just think he does everything that you want a receiver to be able to do.""

Nacua's fearlessness at the point of attack and sticky hands leads to some ridiculous catches. He's also a bully with the ball in his hands and is faster on the field than his 4.57-yard 40 time indicates.

""He might not be the fastest, but he's damn sure one of the toughest,"" cornerback Chauncey Gardner-Johnson said.

Chicago knows Adams' ability well from his time in Green Bay. Only Calvin Johnson Jr. has more receiving touchdowns (11) than Adams (10) against the Bears in the Super Bowl era. Adams led the NFL with 14 receiving touchdowns despite missing the final three games of the season. He's a weapon in the red zone that Chicago must keep out of paydirt Sunday.

The Bears ranked 29th in total defense (361.8 total YPG allowed), 22nd in pass defense (227.2 YPG), and allowed 32 passing touchdowns (fifth-most) in 2025.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/ojqs9dtcanjkse2ocvxt,N,,2026-01-16 17:04:18.733630

Asked previously who needs to step up if Collins can't suit up, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said: ""Whoever is open, baby.""","Three must-know storylines

Maye faces his toughest challenge yet. Drake Maye has had an MVP-caliber second season, and he rebounded from a slow start last week to finish strong in a win over the Chargers. But Maye arguably faces his toughest test of his season with the Texans' defense, which ranked top three in the regular season in points per game allowed (17.4), yards per game allowed (277.2) and takeaways (29). Houston dominated the Steelers in last week's 30-6 win. The Texans are sure to take note of Maye's struggles when the Chargers went man coverage, completing only 1 of 7 passes for 7 yards while taking three sacks, per Next Gen Stats. Houston played man slightly less than the league average in the regular season at 25.2% of the time. But when the Texans went man against the Steelers on Monday, Aaron Rodgers was only 1 for 6 passing for 4 yards and a sack. The Patriots' offensive line, with two rookies starting, will have its hands full with an elite rush unit led by Will Anderson Jr., Danielle Hunter and Sheldon Rankins. Maye has an escape hatch with his running ability, and the Texans have occasionally struggled with running quarterbacks, even while keeping Josh Allen and others in check. But Maye also has receiving threats on all three levels. Kayshon Boutte and Kyle Williams are deep threats. Stefon Diggs and Hunter Henry often patrol the intermediate part of the field. And the Patriots have a strong short passing game, with Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson getting more in on the fun, in addition to what they offer in the run game. Stevenson has especially been a weapon down the stretch, but the Texans have bottled up some quality backs this season.

Stroud hoping for bounce-back effort against reenergized Patriots D. C.J. Stroud was starting his fifth career postseason game Monday against the Steelers, which is why it was surprising he appeared spooked at times during a three-turnover performance. Stroud fumbled five times (losing two) and threw his first red-zone interception since 2023 in the win, thankfully bailed out by his team's dominant defense. Stroud also had some good moments in the game, but he'll need to have a far cleaner outing against a Patriots defense that mercilessly pressured Justin Herbert last week. Since getting Milton Williams back, the Patriots' pass-rush unit has appeared significantly more impactful, and they're also deeper and healthier at linebacker. Stroud's ballhandling issues were out of character, but the least he can do is get more in sync with center Jake Andrews; three of the fumbles came on shaky snaps. What steadied Houston's offense against the Steelers was a strong game from running back Woody Marks, who ran for 112 yards and put the game away with his fourth-quarter touchdown. The Texans run-blocked effectively, with only one negative-yard run, and were able to offset the inconsistent passing game. The Patriots' run defense has been very solid, especially since the return of Williams and Jack Gibbens, who had seven tackles on only 14 defensive snaps last week. If Marks can't get loose, the onus would shift back to Stroud to make plays. Staying patient against the Patriots, who don't allow a lot of big plays, might be the key, although they've shown more willingness to blitz and play more man coverage later in the season.

Injury robs viewers of great head-to-head matchup. Two star players -- Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez and Texans wide receiver Nico Collins -- were likely slated to face off head-to-head against each other quite a bit, but separate injuries clouded their respective statuses ahead of the Divisional Round. Although Gonzalez and Collins both suffered concussions during the Wild Card Round, Gonzalez came off the injury report Friday and is good to go, while Collins won't clear concussion protocol and must sit. The Patriots' defense is simply different with Gonzalez on the field, able to play more man defense when they want to, with Gonzalez often erasing his assignment. According to NGS, Gonzalez didn't allow a reception on five targets (26 coverage snaps) against the Chargers, with two passes defended. Collins, Houston's receiving-yards leader who now has been evaluated for multiple concussions in 2025, leaves a big hole by missing the contest. However, in the one regular-season game Collins missed this season prior to resting in Week 18 (Week 8 vs. San Francisco), C.J. Stroud was terrific, completing 30 of 39 passes for 319 yards, with two TDs and one pick. It was a balanced attack, too, with seven Texans catching multiple passes and no receiver having more than 69 yards. Texans tight end Dalton Schultz has been one of Stroud's most trusted pass catchers, and WR Christian Kirk had his first 100-yard game in more than two seasons on Monday and has a good postseason track record. The Texans also have leaned on Xavier Hutchinson and rookies Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel at times. Asked previously who needs to step up if Collins can't suit up, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said: ""Whoever is open, baby.""

Darnold said he “felt a little something” in his oblique while throwing during Thursday’s practice, but he expects to play Saturday night.

“In routes on air, just kind of felt a little something in my oblique,” Darnold said. “Just didn’t want to push it. Wasn’t the day to push it. So that was it. So just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

Darnold started all 17 regular-season games for the Seahawks while helping lead them to a franchise-best 14-3 record and the NFC’s top seed. He finished eighth in the NFL in completion rate (67.7%), fifth in passing yards (4,048), tied for ninth in touchdown passes (25) and second in yards per pass attempt (8.5). He also threw 14 interceptions, which were the third-most in the league.

Darnold said he’s never experienced oblique issues before.

“We’ll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday,” Darnold said.

When asked about his chances of not being able to play, he responded: “It’s a very low percentage. Probably closer to zero.”

Seattle’s backup quarterback is Drew Lock, who has made 28 starts over his seven-year NFL career.

Lock, a 2019 second-round draft pick by the Denver Broncos, spent his first three seasons in the Mile High City before arriving in Seattle as part of the Russell Wilson trade in March 2022.

Lock then spent the next two seasons backing up former Seahawks quarterback Geno Smith, which included two starts in 2023 when Smith was sidelined with an injury. In the latter of those two starts, Lock led a dramatic game-winning drive against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday Night Football.

Lock signed with the New York Giants in 2024 with the hope of earning their starting job, but ended up making just five starts. He returned to Seattle last April on a two-year, $5 million deal.

Lock has completed 2 of 3 passes for 15 yards this season, with all three pass attempts coming in the latter stages of a Week 3 rout of the New Orleans Saints.

“Drew’s been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,” Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said. “A lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.”

What the Bills need to do to win: Keep winning short-yardage situations. The tush push on fourth down that propelled Josh Allen 10 yards and helped secure Buffalo’s win over Jacksonville last weekend epitomised how the Bills dominated the game’s crucial moments. The Bills converted four of their five third downs with four yards or to go last Sunday, and they finished fifth in third-down rate in the regular season in the same situations. Denver were eighth this season in third-and-short defensive efficiency (50.6%). Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady will have to find ways to create leverage for Allen and the Bills in those vital moments to keep the scoreboard moving.

What the Broncos need to do to win: Copy the Jaguars (except the losing part). If James Cook, this season’s best running back, had been allowed to take off last Sunday, Jacksonville wouldn’t have kept the game so close. Cook’s meagre 46 yards on 15 carries meant the Jags almost pulled off the victory. Buffalo may struggle to establish the ground game even more against the Broncos: they lost their two best run-blocking receivers toACL tears against the Jags, Gabe Davis and Tyrell Shavers. Not that the Broncos’ rock-solid front needs too much help: they gave away the second-fewest rushing yards per game this season (91). If Allen is forced to throw, Sean Payton’s defense can feast. They have the most sacks and the highest rate of QB takedowns (68 at 9.7%) and allow the second-lowest pass completion rate (57.8%). Former Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib, who won a Super Bowl with Denver, is confident: “They sending Superman home,” he said this week.

Key player: Nik Bonitto, edge, Broncos. Bonitto has cemented his status as an elite pass rusher with two brilliant seasons in Denver, earning 13.5 sacks in 2024 and 14 in 2025. He has the power to hustle, harass and help show Allen the door.

Prediction: Bills over Broncos.

San Francisco 49ers v Seattle Seahawks (Saturday 8pm ET/Sunday 1am GMT)

What the 49ers need to do to win: Show no fear. San Francisco rolled into Philadelphia with a litany of injuries and proved that this team are so much more than the sum of their parts. You no longer feel that a key figure such as George Kittle landing on injured reserve with a torn achilles will slow them down. Adversity just keeps knitting them tighter together, so much so that, against the Eagles, journeyman receiver Demarcus Robinson produced his first 100+ receiving yard-game since November 2022. A large part of the 49ers’ fight comes from the ultimate underdog quarterback, Brock Purdy. His never-say-die attitude was crucial as he shook off two interceptions and backed his deep ball over a fierce Eagles secondary. If they bring the same fearless attitude to Seattle they can handle Sam Darnold, who says he will play despite being listed as questionable with an oblique injury.

What the Seahawks need to do to win: With Trent Williams back in at left tackle for the 49ers, the Seahawks will have a fight on their hands after a fairly straightforward 13-3 win over San Francisco in Week 18 of the regular season. A clear path to victory though lies behind punishing the 49ers’ weak run defense. In the Week 18 win, Kenneth Walker and Zach Charbonnet’s combined 171 yards rushing yards were essential to keeping the Seahawks’ offense on the field as they chewed up the clock. The pressure told on Purdy, who had limited time to score while facing Seattle’s formidable defense.

Key player: Devon Witherspoon, CB, Seahawks. Witherspoon does everything brilliantly, though you may not always know it as quarterbacks often avoid throwing in his direction. Behind Witherspoon, the Legion of Boom 2.0 conceded the fewest points per game in the regular season (17.2).

Prediction: Seahawks over 49ers (all bets are off if Darnold doesn’t play though).

Houston Texans v New England Patriots (Sunday 3pm ET/8pm GMT)

What the Texans need to do to win: The Texans will expect their defense to make the Patriots suffer. Their offense is less of an asset and lost its best receiver, Nico Collins, to a concussion against Pittsburgh on Monday. Surprisingly, veteran receiver Christian Kirk stepped to lead the Texans to victory after doing next to nothing all season. Kirk made eight grabs for 144 yards and a touchdown and rapidly became Houston’s lone star on offense. In a perfect world, Collins makes it through concussion protocol – although that looks unlikely – if not Kirk needs to continue to do the heavy lifting.

What the Patriots need to do to win: Attack Houston’s offensive line. The Patriots knew they had a huge advantage over the Chargers’ wafer-thin pass protection, and they subjected Justin Herbert to six sacks, 16 pressures and 11 hits. The Patriots need to blitz CJ Stroud as much as possible to force the quarterback into mistakes. The Texans’ offensive line had the 22nd-ranked pass block grade from Pro Football Focus this season. After dominating the Chargers, defensive end Milton Williams needs to be relied on once more to make sure the Patriots punch their ticket to the AFC championship game.

Key player: Rhamondre Stevenson, RB, Patriots. Stevenson may not own the top spot in New England’s backfield for much longer but he showed how vital his versatility as a runner and receiver is in the win over the Chargers. He had 75 yards on three receptions while accounting for 30% of New England’s total offensive output. He is a workhorse whose all-round abilities will be crucial in trying to outfox Houston’s brutal defense.

Prediction: Patriots over Texans.

Los Angeles Rams v Chicago Bears (Sunday 6.30pm ET/11.30pm GMT)

What the Rams need to do to win: The Bears love a comeback, so Sean McVay needs to use every play he has secreted away while leaning on his vast array of offensive weapons. Wringing every last drop of production from Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua is the first step to blowing the Bears out of the water. Stafford targeted Nacua 18 times against the Panthers last weekend, so he should at least be aiming for more than 20 on Sunday. When the Panthers didn’t show Nacua special attention he pulled off a string of chunk plays. He was also deployed as a runner, and bulldozed through three defenders for a touchdown. The Bears will always believe they can dig out a victory so the Rams should give them no hope whatsoever by spamming Nacua’s involvement until Chicago break.

What the Bears need to do to win: Ben Johnson needs to be prepared for the Rams’ pass rush. Los Angeles have a key member of their secondary back: Quentin Lake, who freezes quarterbacks into holding the ball so that McVay’s heavy hitters, Jared Verse, Byron Young and Kobie Turner, can make a decisive sack. Johnson needs to scheme up the offense so they don’t get that chance. He should spotlight the out-of-structure playmaking of Caleb Williams – whose sack rate has dropped from 10.8% as a rookie to 4% this season – to stay one step ahead while using large doses of play action to draw the sting from blitzes. Williams needs to stay on his feet to get the ball out to his receivers who excel in yards after the catch. Rookie tight end Colston Loveland could be a huge headache for the Rams if he gets the targets.

Key player: Montez Sweat, DE, Bears. The defensive lineman is surging at just the right time for Chicago. His three hits on Jordan Love earned him the game ball in the win over the Packers. The Bears need all of that and a few sacks to mitigate the danger of Stafford’s incredible array of receiving weapons.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3866fe55361a7d1735aa82e666432a472b51ce21/69_55_4931_3945/master/4931.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=595a6c28b601ae1e5799f30d7c067420",N,,2026-01-16 13:02:39.716120

Houston Texans wide receiver Nico Collins remains in concussion protocol and missed Thursday’s media session, according to the Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander.

Collins is unlikely to play in Sunday’s divisional round game against the New England Patriots because of the steps needed to clear concussion protocol.

Collins suffered the concussion in Monday’s wild-card 30-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins had 3 catches for 21 yards in the game before going down.

If Collins cannot go, expect Christian Kirk, Jayden Higgins, and Dalton Schultz to see an increase in targets. Jaylin Noel, Xavier Hutchinson and Cade Stover could also see an increased role.

The one-score games they won in 2024, which helped them to a Super Bowl appearance, turned out to be defeats in 2025. Too many dropped passes and other silly mistakes cost the team multiple times.

""I think just compounding mistakes,"" Mahomes said when asked what went wrong in 2025. ""You make mistakes throughout a game. For myself, I look at some of the red zone interceptions I threw in kind of bigger moments in the third and fourth quarter of games. That’s stuff that I haven’t done in the past, and so speaking for myself, just trying to be better in those moments. I think offensively we weren’t consistent enough throughout games. We had stretches in games where we played good, we had stretches in the season where we played really good.

""We’ve got to be better and that starts with me and then it kind of has to feed throughout the entire offense. So, I think like I said, guys are motivated, coaches, players, we’re all motivated to be better this next year. Like I said, it sucks watching these games. I want to be out there playing football, especially this time of year, it’s the best time of year to play football. It’ll give us the motivation, hopefully, for us to come back stronger next year.""

The relative parity in the league paved the way for tightly contested matchups in the wild card round. But ultimately six teams were sent packing and now we get to see the remaining eight, including the two top seeds, duke it out for spots in the conference championship games.

Here are the games we’ll be watching:

Saturday

Sunday

Last weekend, we learned a lot about the teams that prevailed. Here are the questions that will be answered this weekend.

Can a banged-up Josh Allen survive the Broncos’ pass rush and the altitude in Denver?

Bills quarterback Josh Allen made multiple trips to the injury tent during a physical wild card game against the Jacksonville Jaguars last weekend.

Earlier this week, Buffalo’s injury report listed Allen as “foot/knee/finger,” a testament to the many bumps and bruises he’s nursing at this point in the season. He’ll play, obviously, and continue his quest to seize the moment in a Kansas City Chiefs-less playoff field to finally get his Super Bowl glory.

But, the contact-prone (and some people might say “contact-seeking”) QB will now face a defense that excels at taking down the opposition – literally. The Broncos’ 68 sacks in the regular season were 11 more than any other team and 20 more than any team that made the playoffs.

Allen, the reigning MVP, is the better QB in this matchup, having the edge over second-year Broncos signal-caller Bo Nix, whose only prior playoff start was a loss to Allen and the Bills last season. But not only will Allen face a formidable pass rush, he’ll have to travel to Denver to do so.

The Broncos are healthy, better rested after getting the bye, and for the first time in 10 years, playing a postseason game at home where their acclimation to the mile-high altitude gives them an advantage.

Can the Texans do something they’ve never done before?

The Houston Texans are the NFL’s youngest franchise. But even still, it sticks out that in every one of their prior 23 seasons, they’ve yet to appear in a conference championship game.

Over that same time frame, the Patriots, on the other hand, have played in 12 conference championship games.

This Texans team, however, enters the divisional round on an incredible run – its 10-straight victories are the longest winning streak in the NFL right now and they’re coming off a first-ever franchise playoff road victory. Houston’s defense shone in a resounding 30-6 romp over the Pittsburgh Steelers that featured two defensive touchdowns and four sacks of Aaron Rodgers.

To make franchise history, though, they’ll have to win on the road, again, as underdogs, and potentially without Pro Bowl wide receiver Nico Collins, who is still in concussion protocol after getting injured in the wild card game.

And they’ll have to beat the possible MVP in Pats QB Drake Maye. The 23-year-old looked a little shaky in the first half of his first playoff game last weekend, but he settled down in the second half.

This New England team isn’t the same one that built a dynasty earlier in the 2000s, but taking down the Pats would still qualify as a sign that the Texans are all grown up as a team.

Can the Niners muster any offense in a rematch marred by injury?

It’s a rematch of the Week 18 showdown for the top seed in the NFC that saw the Seahawks prevail by stifling the 49ers’ offense. Seattle’s defense surrendered the fewest points in the regular season, only allowing a single field goal to San Francisco earlier this month. That victory was also part of an NFL-best 6-2 record against playoff teams.

It earned the Seahawks a week of rest while the Niners had to crisscross the country, traveling to Philadelphia for the wild card game and now back to the Pacific Northwest. After they played on Sunday last weekend, San Francisco’s head coach Kyle Shanahan implored the NFL to give his guys a full week of rest before the next round.

Instead, they’ll play Saturday – while their opponent had a bye, the Niners are stuck with a short week for the third time in the past month.

And the same offense that struggled against Seattle so recently will be even more shorthanded in this even higher-stakes matchup after losing George Kittle to a season-ending Achilles injury against the Eagles.

Of course, the injury advantage would tip back the other way if it ends up that Seahawks QB Sam Darnold, currently listed as questionable with an oblique injury, can’t play. Speaking on those reports, Darnold said “nothing to see here” and “feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

Can the Bears keep winning like this?

Last week, we wrote that if the Rams advanced, they could be the Super Bowl favorites. Advance, they did. Although the odds still give the edge to Seattle, the Rams are a very close second. Maybe they’re destined to duke it out officially against Seattle in the conference championship.

But first, they’ll serve as the proving ground for Caleb Williams and the Chicago Bears to demonstrate that their high-drama overperformance is a trick that they can turn to even against formidable foes.

Against their rival Green Bay Packers, the Bears won in increasingly classic-for-them fashion. Which is to say, Ben Johnson repeatedly went for it on fourth down, which often failed in maddening fashion but worked just often enough.

On top of that, Chicago fell behind early, trailing 21-6 through three quarters, only to rally for their seventh fourth-quarter comeback of the season. Williams held on the ball for what felt like too long at times, only to rattle off the kind of under-pressure passes that showcased the rare physical tools that made him the top overall draft pick in 2024.

After last weekend, the Bears are 3-3 when trailing by 10 points or more in the final five minutes of the game. The rest of the NFL combined is 3-158. That shouldn’t be a replicable skill.

But if it is? Watch out.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap26005565916878.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-16 11:04:10.106486

Darnold, the former Jets first-round draft pick and current Seahawks quarterback, popped up as a surprise name on the Seattle injury report on Thursday, two days before the Seahawks’ Saturday night home NFC divisional playoff showdown with the 49ers.

Darnold has an oblique injury and has been listed as questionable for the game.

It’s not clear when or how Darnold was injured, since Thursday was the first time such an injury was mentioned, and the Seahawks, as the No. 1 seed in the conference, had a bye last week.

Darnold wasn’t on the injury report prior to Thursday.

When speaking to reporters on Thursday, Darnold said he “felt a little something” in his oblique during practice but he expects to play Saturday night.

“[I] just kind of felt a little something in my oblique [and] just didn’t want to push it,’’ Darnold said. “It wasn’t the day to push it, so that was it. So, [I] just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

The last time Darnold played was in the Seahawks’ regular-season finale, a 13-3 win over the 49ers for the No. 1 seed at Lumen Field.

According to reports, Darnold was seen jogging on the practice field Thursday and didn’t appear to be laboring or having any trouble moving.

Seahawks backup quarterback Drew Lock got some reps with the first-team offense in practice Thursday and would start if Darnold can’t go. Rookie Jalen Milroe is the third-string quarterback and would back up Lock in that scenario.

Darnold, who completed 67.7 percent of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions, led the Seahawks to a 14-3 record.

A year ago, he led the Vikings to an identical 14-3 record, throwing for 4,319 yards with 35 TDs and 12 INTs. But he flamed out in the Vikings’ one-and-done 27-9 playoff loss to the Rams, against whom he completed 25-of-40 passes with one touchdown and one interception while getting sacked nine times.

San Francisco 49ers star tight end George Kittle suffered a season-ending Achilles tear during 49ers’ playoff victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. He would be missing the rest of the postseason and probably some part of his 2026 campaign. It typically takes nine to twelve months for an Achilles tendon tear to repair. Just days before Kittle’s injury, a conspiracy NFL injury theory was doing cyberspace rounds. It states that the emissions of low-frequency electromagnetic fields from a substation near 49ers’ facility, has been degrading collagen, weakening tendons and causing soft tissue damage.

Achilles/patellar and hamstring/calf tears and high-ankle ligament injuries

According to a researcher Peter Cowan, a board-certified quantum biology practitioner and wellness entrepreneur, “The San Francisco 49ers are statistically the most injured team in the NFL over the past decade. Since they’ve moved to Levi’s Stadium in 2014, there have been seven to eight full Achilles/patellar ruptures, 40+ major hamstring/calf tears, and high-ankle syndesmosis [ligament] injuries every year.”

49ers players are reportedly aware of the EM fields

Cowan further re-shared Chat Sports host Chase Senior’s report on X that in early 2025, a retired 49ers guard Jon Feliciano said, “Players have joked around about there being an electrical substation right next to the practice field and how that has led to the Niners’ injury problems.” Senior further said that there have been a lot of studies how cell phones, blue tooth, wireless earbuds, etc emit a lot of EMF [electromotive force] and that it can be harmful to people.

EM field levels in the practice premises

The researcher visited the practice fields with a gauss meter [a device that measures the strength and direction of a magnetic field]. Typical background exposure is 0.5 to 3 mG. At the far edge of the practice field, the level was +8.5 mG and inside the facilities [weight room, film room, recovery areas], the level was 10 to 25 mG.

Effects of chronic ELF exposure

Degrading the collagen integrity in the players’ tendons, ligaments, and muscle-tendon junctions. The damage is subtle until a routine cut or block ends in catastrophic rupture. “The injury pattern matches the biological fingerprint of prolonged ELF [extremely low frequency] exposure documented in peer-reviewed research,” Cowan said in an X post which has generated nearabout 22 million views.

Such has been an occurrence often during Shanahan’s tenure in San Francisco.

This season alone, the 49ers lost defensive end Nick Bosa, linebacker Fred Warner and tight end George Kittle to season-ending injuries. Kittle tore his Achilles in this past Sunday’s NFC Wild Card Round win over the Philadelphia Eagles. The week prior, a theory was born.

The 49ers’ practice facility, which is next door to Levi’s Stadium, also neighbors an electrical substation. Peter Cowan, a self-proclaimed scientist, posted on X that, in his belief, the electrical substation was the reason for San Francisco’s injury outbreaks over the years.

“Chronic ELF exposure is degrading the collagen integrity in the players tendons, ligaments, and muscle-tendon junctions,” Cowan wrote as part of a thread. “The damage is subtle, until a routine cut or block ends in catastrophic rupture. The injury pattern matches the biological fingerprint of prolonged ELF exposure documented in peer-reviewed research.”

While there is no established evidence to support Cowan’s theory, per a recent report from Front Office Sports, the theory has caught on with agents around the league. The Washington Post spoke with about two dozen NFL agents. Several said that players had real concerns about it, and a couple “speculated the popularity of the theory could affect the 49ers’ ability to attract or retain free agents this offseason.”

NFL agents address 49ers injury conspiracy

“There is something there,” one agent told the Post. “Always wondered why my guys would take longer to heal [in San Francisco]. Then read this and makes sense.”

Other agents were skeptical it could impact San Francisco’s ability to do business this offseason. Trey Robinson of the AthElite agency said he conducted his own research.

“I’m not a scientist,” Robinson said. “But if there’s a way to eliminate something being an issue, we’ll take whatever steps we can to address our clients’ concerns.”

What is an undeniable fact is that the 49ers have been snakebitten by injuries. Despite that, San Francisco is one win away from the NFC Championship Game.

When Restrepo looked back at his rookie season, he said it was a learning experience.
After being inactive the first 10 weeks of the 2025 season while on the team's practice squad, Restrepo ended up playing in two games during the season.
""Work, work and more work,"" he said.
Restrepo said he got faster working with the team's strength and conditioning staff during the course of the year.","NASHVILLE – Xavier Restrepo had a legendary career at the University of Miami, where he finished as the school's all-time leader in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns.

It earned him All-American honors, along with plenty of other accolades.

The success didn't result in Restrepo being picked in the NFL Draft, however, and when he joined the Titans as an undrafted free agent last offseason, he had to wait a long time just to get on the field, after initially being cut.

When Restrepo looked back at his rookie season, he said it was a learning experience.

""It was very humbling,"" he said. ""But I think I learned so much through it, as far as being a pro each and every day, growing in my faith, and being ready when your time is called. And, for the most part, I think every time I stepped in the game, I was productive. I feel I took advantage of my opportunities, and that is what the NFL is about.""

But things weren't easy for Restrepo as he worked to get on the field.

And the experience has inspired him to work even harder moving forward following a season when he did plenty of soul searching, and praying.

""My faith is the only thing that kept me going,"" Restrepo said. ""My whole life story, I have always been an underdog. But it's different when you're at your dream, and your dream is so close, yet so far away. And the only thing you can rely on is your faith. Through so many prayers, and even doubt, I talked to my Lord and Savior and let Him know I was struggling with doubt and worry and this business, it's a Not For Long business. And I asked Him to give me confidence, and give me the joy of the game back, because I was losing it. I'll be honest: I was losing it.

""But me playing football again, God answered my prayers, and I am just super thankful.""

After being inactive the first 10 weeks of the 2025 season while on the team's practice squad, Restrepo ended up playing in two games during the season. Restrepo caught two passes for 26 yards in his NFL debut against the Seahawks on November 23, but the following week against the Jaguars he was carted off with an ankle injury after making one catch for 15 yards.

The lack of playing time, and final stats – three catches for 41 yards – wasn't exactly what Restrepo envisioned when he joined Tennessee, where he was initially cut out of training camp, and signed to the team's practice squad. Restrepo ended up spending the entire year on the practice squad, as he was a gameday elevation for the two games.

Earlier this month the team retained Restrepo's rights by signing him to a futures contract.

Restrepo made it clear the doubt he experienced as a rookie had nothing to do with his ability, but more with whether he'd get a chance.

As he heads into the offseason, his plan to get better – and make more a bigger impact moving forward – is hard, but simple.

""Work, work and more work,"" he said.

Restrepo said he got faster working with the team's strength and conditioning staff during the course of the year.

Restrepo was clocked at 20.1 miles per hour prior to arriving in Tennessee, but he said he ran a 21.51 after working with Zac Woodfin, director of sports performance, and John Shaw, assistant sports performance – speed training.

Restrepo, who recorded 200 receptions, 2,844 receiving yards and 21 touchdowns at Miami, said he felt like he got better as a player as well.

But there's more work that needs to be done, and Restrepo knows it.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/titans/seremrxaezic2v8chywy,N,,2026-01-15 23:58:44.968068

Mahomes said he hopes to be able to do ""some stuff"" in OTAs and ""a lot"" come training camp. The star quarterback suffered the ACL late in an eventual loss to the Los Angeles Chargers the same day the Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention and Green Bay Packers star Micah Parsons also tore his ACL. Speaking to the media Monday, Parsons also said he hoped to be back by Week 1 but ""realistically, probably like Week 3, Week 4.""

Mahomes said after suffering the injury he initially asked the Chiefs' medical staff if he could put a brace on the knee and finish the game, a request the staff denied.

Mahomes also looked back on the season as a whole as Kansas City missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014 (Mahomes was a freshman at Texas Tech that year) and finished the season with a 6-11 record.

""I think just compounding mistakes,"" Mahomes said. ""You make mistakes throughout a game. For myself, I look at some of the red-zone interceptions I threw in kinda bigger moments in the third and fourth quarter of games. That's stuff that I hadn't done in the past. Speaking for myself, just trying to be better in those moments. I think offensively, we weren't consistent enough throughout games. We had stretches in games we played good, we had stretches in the season we played really good, but we gotta be better, and that starts with me and it has to feed throughout the entire offense.""

The Pro Bowl quarterback is suddenly questionable to play Saturday in Seattle’s NFC divisional playoff game against San Francisco at Lumen Field. The team listed him following practice Thursday on its official injury report for the game as having a new, oblique injury.

Darnold said he felt a pulling-like discomfort on his left, non-throwing side Thursday while throwing a pass during a no-pads practice outside. He, the team’s coaches and training personnel decided at that moment to shut him down for the rest of the practice, a move Darnold characterized as precautionary.

“Just in routes on air just kind of felt a little something in my oblique,” Darnold said following a practice he didn’t finish.

Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said veteran backup Drew Lock finished the practice with the starting offense Thursday, two days before top-seeded Seattle (14-3) hosts its rival San Francisco 49ers (13-5) in the Seahawks’ playoff opener at Lumen Field coming off a postseason bye.

“Just didn’t want to push it, wasn’t the day to push it. That was it,” Darnold said.

“So just came inside, got some rehab — and feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

This is the first time Darnold has had any issue to an oblique muscle in his side.

“It’s fun,” he said with a smile. “It’s fun. We’ll attack it in the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday.”

The News Tribune asked Darnold what percentage of him thinks he might not play against the 49ers with the Seahawks two home wins from the Super Bowl.

“Very low percentage,” he said. “Probably closer to zero.”

He smiled.

Asked if he was going to be getting “around-the-clock” treatment between now and game time, Darnold said: “Yeah, we’ll be getting some treatment.

“But like I said, I feel really confident about going on Saturday.”

Kubiak, Darnold’s play caller, is keenly interested in his quarterback’s next 48 hours until kickoff against San Francisco. The team will test Darnold’s oblique with his throwing motion in pregame Saturday. The day before games are typically nothing but a walk-through of the game plan in T-shirts and ball caps. He doesn’t have to throw in that to prepare like his teammates on Friday.

“Obviously with any injury, you just want to know what the significance is,” Kubiak said.

The offensive coordinator referred all other questions and comments about Darnold’s injury to his boss, head coach Mike Macdonald. He is scheduled to next talk to the media Friday following the walk-through.

Darnold jogged from the team facility onto the practice field using a Theragun-type device on his throwing side, opposite where the oblique injury occurred early in the practice.

“Nothing to see here,” Darnold said to reporters, cheerfully.

NFL injury reports, explained

In 2016 the NFL did away with “probable” as one of the official designations on injury reports for games, which the league requires teams to submit to NFL headquarters two days before games. Since that change, any player who less than a virtual certainty to play gets listed as “questionable.” That is now the lowest designation before full go to play and a player not being on the injury report at all.

The designations for NFL injury reports are out, doubtful (75% chance he won’t play) and questionable (officially a 50% chance he won’t play). If a previously injured player is not on the injury report for a game, he’s playing.

That’s the case with Seahawks starting left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant. They’ve each missed the last three and two games, respectively, to end the regular season. But they are not on the injury report for the game Saturday. So Cross and Bryant are returning to play.

Same with linebacker Ernest Jones and cornerback Riq Woolen. Jones missed practice Tuesday and was limited Wednesday because of an unspecified illness. He was in the training room lifting weights with a mask on when practice was beginning Thursday. Yet Jones is not on the injury report, so he’s playing as usual Saturday.

Woolen was limited in practices Tuesday and Wednesday because of his own oblique issue. But Woolen is not on the injury report. He’s also full go to play.

Rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo was a full participant in practices this week coming off injured reserve. But the team added him to the game injury report later Thursday. He is out for Saturday. So is Chazz Surratt. The special-teams mainstay and former 49er is not coming off injured reserve, either. At least not yet.

Sam Darnold appeared on the Seahawks' injury report Thursday as a limited participant due to an oblique injury.

The Vikings and 49ers faced off in Week 2 of the 2024 season with Darnold and Minnesota earning a 23-17 win.","Take a breath, Seattle Seahawks fans. Your QB1 is okay.

Sam Darnold appeared on the Seahawks' injury report Thursday as a limited participant due to an oblique injury. This was unexpected; Darnold was off the report on Tuesday and Wednesday.

The team listed him as questionable to play in Saturday's divisional playoff game against NFC West foe San Francisco.

He later confirmed that he would indeed be suiting up against the 49ers.

""Kind of just felt a little something on that oblique, just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said today. ""Wasn't the day to push it so that was it. So I just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Thursday was the final practice for the Seahawks due to the short week. They'll be at home for Saturday's game against the visiting No. 6 seed 49ers.

Seattle took care of business on the road against San Francisco the last time these two teams faced off. The Seahawks' defense held the 49ers' offense in check for a 13-3 win in Week 18.

Darnold was a steady 20 for 26 passing for 198 yards in that one. He fumbled once but it did not end in a turnover for the Seahawks.

This is the fourth time Darnold is playing his former team, but the first time in the postseason. Darnold spent the 2023 season with the 49ers on their way to an NFC title before signing with Minnesota in 2024. The Vikings and 49ers faced off in Week 2 of the 2024 season with Darnold and Minnesota earning a 23-17 win.

Saturday marks Darnold's first playoff game since the Vikings' 27-9 loss in the wild-card round of the 2024 playoffs. He struggled in that game and completed 25 of 40 passes for 245 yards, one touchdown, one interception and a fumble lost.

The Rams defense sacked him nine times in that game. He and the Seahawks will be hoping for a better result this time in the postseason.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/15/USAT/88204033007-usatsi-27893639.jpg?crop=4417,2486,x0,y225&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-15 20:00:19.403606

“Didn’t want to push it,” Darnold said. “Wasn’t the day to push it. That was it. Just came inside, got some rehab. Feel like I’ll be ready to go for Saturday.”

The eighth-year quarterback said this is the first time he has dealt with an oblique issue and that he’ll be getting treatment leading up to the game. When asked about his chances of sitting out, Darnold said, “Very low percentage. Probably closer to zero.”

Darnold passed for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in his first season with the Seahawks, earning his second straight Pro Bowl selection. He led Seattle to a 14-3 record and the NFC’s top seed.

Backup Drew Lock has appeared in five games this season and attempted just three passes. Lock started five games for the New York Giants in 2024 and has 28 career NFL starts, completing 59.6% of passes with 34 touchdowns and 28 interceptions.

“Drew’s been really impressive throughout OTAs and training camp and in his role,” offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said. “A lot of confidence in Drew. Brought him here for a reason.”

The doctor said that I could be, but I can’t predict what’s going to happen throughout the process,” Mahomes said.
Since then, he has primarily done his rehab in Kansas City under the supervision of Chiefs assistant athletic trainer Julie Frymyer, who helped Mahomes work through previous knee and ankle ailments.
Mahomes said he’s been following a rehab script set by Dr. Dan Cooper, the Dallas Cowboys team physician who performed his surgery.
Even after suffering his knee injury in December, Mahomes said he tried to talk his way back into his team’s 16-13 home loss to the Chargers.","Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes says he’s targeting a Week 1 return after a knee injury ended his 2025 season.

Mahomes, speaking to reporters for the first time since he tore his ACL and LCL in a game against the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14, said Thursday that his rehab from surgery had been “going great so far.

“Obviously, I think long term, I want to be ready for Week 1. The doctor said that I could be, but I can’t predict what’s going to happen throughout the process,” Mahomes said. “But that’s my goal. And so I’ll try to prepare myself to be ready to play in that Week 1 and have no restrictions.”

Mahomes underwent surgery to repair his knee on Dec. 15. Since then, he has primarily done his rehab in Kansas City under the supervision of Chiefs assistant athletic trainer Julie Frymyer, who helped Mahomes work through previous knee and ankle ailments.

So far, Mahomes acknowledges that not every day has felt amazing. Some days, he wakes up determined to go all out during his workout. Other days, he’s just trying to get through.

On each of those days, he says, he’s been reliant on Frymyer.

“Julie has been crushing it, pushing me. And the doctor gives you goals to get to, and I just try to maximize those,” Mahomes said. “They hold me back because I always want to go a little bit further.”

Chiefs head athletic trainer Rick Burkholder said last month that a ballpark timeline for Mahomes to return was nine months.

Mahomes said he’s been following a rehab script set by Dr. Dan Cooper, the Dallas Cowboys team physician who performed his surgery. The goal is to return as quickly as possible without jeopardizing Mahomes’ long-term health.

“That’s why they give me limits to where I can push it,” Mahomes said. “Dr. Cooper, he described that to me. He said, ‘I’ll give you the limits of where you can push it to, and then it’s up to you how far you want to push it to that limit.’ And knowing me, I’m gonna push it to the exact limit every single day.”

Mahomes’ personal ambition is to do “some stuff” during May and June’s organized team activities, then “hopefully be able to do a lot” during training camp in July and August.

The next few months, meanwhile, will be different from past seasons. Mahomes typically hosts a passing camp for teammates in Texas during the NFL’s first phase of the offseason in April; because he’ll still be injured then, that voluntary program is now set to take place at the team’s facility in K.C.

Mahomes still hopes to build camaraderie with teammates during that time, whether that means being with them in the facility or going across the parking lot to attend Kansas City Royals games.

Even after suffering his knee injury in December, Mahomes said he tried to talk his way back into his team’s 16-13 home loss to the Chargers.

“When I was able to move, I asked one of the doctors if I could get a brace and just finish the game, but they wouldn’t let me,” Mahomes said. “Obviously, it kind of sunk in once the game ended, and then I was able to get the results from the MRI and stuff like that. It’s hard, but at the same time, you’ve got to flip the script fast, knowing that it’s gonna be a quick turnaround to get to the season.”

Mahomes completed 63 percent of his passes in 14 games in 2025, throwing for 3,587 yards with 22 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.

He said the vision of being out there with his teammates in Game 1 next season keeps him motivated during a strenuous rehab process.

“There’s places you can’t go yet — which I want to, but I can’t go yet,” Mahomes said. “But at the same time, we’re doing it for a reason.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/15150100/GettyImages-2253282510-scaled-e1768507318677.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-15 23:00:23.027717

The injury occurred Thursday. Darnold said he ""felt a little something"" in the oblique on his left side while throwing during a routes-on-air period, and that he left practice as a precautionary measure.

""Just didn't want to push it,"" Darnold said. ""Wasn't the day to push it. So that was it. Just came inside, got some rehab, and I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

The Seahawks listed Darnold as a limited participant.

The only other Seattle players with game designations are tight end Elijah Arroyo, linebacker Chazz Surratt and tackle Josh Jones, all backups who have been ruled out. Left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant will return after missing three and two games, respectively.

Darnold was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play Saturday.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Veteran Drew Lock is Darnold's backup. Jalen Milroe, a rookie third-round pick, is Seattle's QB3.

Darnold said he has never dealt with an oblique injury and that he'll get treatment between now and game time, adding: ""We'll attack it the next couple days and be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold, signed by the Seahawks in March after they traded Geno Smith to the Las Vegas Raiders, is set to make the second playoff start of his eight-year NFL career. He echoed a sentiment shared earlier this week by coach Mike Macdonald about not getting lost in the hype of the postseason.

""We're treating it [as] just another week, another game,"" Darnold said. ""... We've got such great guys in that locker room, mature leaders at every position group. So everyone's just ready to go, attacking the week, per usual, and getting ready to go up against a really good 49ers team that's been rolling, and we're excited to go up against them.""

Darnold and the Seahawks beat the 49ers in Week 18 at Levi's Stadium to win the NFC West and secure the conference's top seed. With that win, Seattle finished the regular season 14-3, the same record Darnold posted last year with the Minnesota Vikings on his way to his first career Pro Bowl selection.

Darnold made the Pro Bowl again this year, completing 67.7% of his attempts for 4,048 yards and 25 touchdown passes while also leading all NFL players with 20 turnovers.

Darnold lost his playoff debut last January when he was sacked nine times in a wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams. He said the Week 18 win over the 49ers felt like a playoff game because of everything that was at stake and how loud the crowd was at Levi's Stadium.

The Seahawks will have home-field advantage in the rematch.

""Being able to use cadence is going to be huge, and then having our 12s there making noise when they're on offense is crucial,"" Darnold said. ""So, it's going to be an awesome atmosphere and something we're all looking forward to.""

This will be the first playoff game at Lumen Field with fans in the stands since January 2017. The Seahawks' only other home playoff game since then was at the end of the 2020 COVID-19 season, when they lost in the wild-card round to the Rams in an empty stadium.

""We know Lumen's going to be rocking,"" Darnold said. ""It's an important game. We don't get it twisted at all. We understand the implications of the game. The playoffs, it's awesome to be playing in games like this, especially in January. But yeah, we're treating this week as another week and we're excited about it.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1228%2Fr1594429_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 20:00:27.982189

""I feel good,"" Darnold said.
For Darnold, Saturday will be his second playoff game as a starter, having previously started in the Vikings' wild card loss to the Rams last season.
Like the rest of his teammates, Darnold recognizes what's at stake, but isn't changing his approach during the week.
It's an important game, we don't get it twisted at all, we understand the implications of the game, the playoffs.","Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold exited Thursday's practice early for treatment on a new oblique injury, and as a result he was listed as questionable for Saturday's divisional round game against the 49ers.

But before panic could fully set in around the Puget Sound region, Seattle's Pro Bowl quarterback said after practice that he plans to play on Saturday.

""I feel good,"" Darnold said. ""In routes on air, I just felt a little something in my oblique. I just didn't want to push it. It wasn't the day to push it, so that was it. I came inside, got some rehab, and I feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold could even joke about the injury, saying, ""It's fun. We'll attack it the next couple of days and be ready to go on Saturday… It is what it is. I felt it on a throw, but we'll be ready to go.""

When a follow-up question asked Darnold the likelihood that he would not play, he said, ""It's a very low percentage, probably closer to zero.""

Later in the press conference, when he received yet another question about the injury and what will need to happen between now and Saturday, Darnold said, ""We'll be getting some treatment, but I feel really confident about going on Saturday… I just felt a little something and didn't want to make it worse. It was just a precautionary thing to be able to get in and get some rehab on it.""

For Darnold, Saturday will be his second playoff game as a starter, having previously started in the Vikings' wild card loss to the Rams last season. Like the rest of his teammates, Darnold recognizes what's at stake, but isn't changing his approach during the week.

""For me, it's just continuing to treat it as another week, just like I did last year, but just having that same mindset, and letting the guys know it's just another game,"" he said. ""Obviously, you prepare the same way, but when we get out there, we know Lumen (Field) is going to be rocking. It's an important game, we don't get it twisted at all, we understand the implications of the game, the playoffs. It's awesome to be playing in games like this, especially in January. But we're treating this week as another week, and we're excited about it.

Other than Darnold, the only player on the 53-man roster with a game status designation is tackle Josh Jones, who has been ruled out with a knee injury. Jones started the previous three games at left tackle in place of an injured Charles Cross, who does not have a status this week, meaning he is ready to return. Also back this week is safety Coby Bryant, who missed the final two games of the regular season with a knee injury.

This time around, he became the fourth quarterback in NFL history to guide two different teams to 14-win seasons, joining Peyton Manning, Tom Brady and Jared Goff.

Despite a league-high 20 turnovers, Darnold made the Pro Bowl. With a win over San Francisco in the regular-season finale, Seattle earned the division title and the NFC's No. 1 seed, which came with a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.

Offensive tackles Morgan Moses and Thayer Munford Jr. returned for Thursday’s practice after knee ailments kept both sidelined to begin the week.

Elsewhere in Foxborough, running back Terrell Jennings and cornerback Christian Gonzalez shed red non-contact jerseys while phasing through the NFL’s concussion protocol. Both joined a growing list of full participants that also included defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga on the heels of missing three games due to a foot issue.

Here’s the second injury report ahead of Sunday’s 3 p.m. ET divisional round at Gillette Stadium.

While head coach Mike Vrabel and the AFC East champions had a full house, the same four remained absent for the Texans. Count Collins among them. The perennial 1,000-yard receiver was carted to the locker room during Monday night’s wild card at Acrisure Stadium due to a concussion. With back-to-back missed practices logged since then, he is doubtful to be cleared in time for the No. 5 seed to visit the No. 2 seed.

As offensive bookends returned from knee injuries, a total of four Patriots went in a limited capacity on Thursday. At right tackle, Moses started and stayed in for all 64 snaps last weekend. And as an extension of the line, Munford reported as an eligible tight end on four occasions after carrying a questionable game designation.

The Patriots opened a 21-day window to return from injured reserve as Texans prep began. And Gonzalez, who was ruled out in the closing minutes of the wild card, has also graduated to full participation. The Pro Bowl corner was among a handful in all to go without restrictions on Thursday. And so was Tonga.

Darnold confirmed that the injury occurred during the routes on air portion of Thursday's practice. He said he felt some discomfort on his oblique on the left side and decided not to take any risks regarding practice.

""Didn't wanna push it,"" he said after practice. ""Wasn't the day to push it. That was it. Came inside, got some rehab, and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.""

Darnold said that there is a ""very low percentage"" that he isn't on the field for Seattle's first playoff game.

""Probably closer to zero,"" he said with a slight smile.

Darnold, 28, has been a big key to Seattle's success this season under second-year coach Mike Macdonald. Following a Pro Bowl season with the Vikings last year, Darnold was named to his second straight Pro Bowl this season after throwing for over 4,000 yards and 25 touchdowns in helping lead the 14-3 Seahawks to the NFC's No. 1 seed for the postseason.

Darnold split his two starts this season against the 49ers, throwing for less than 200 yards in both games and not throwing a touchdown pass. He didn't throw any interceptions in those games either while completing 73.5% of his passes.

If Darnold isn't able to play, the Seahawks would turn the keys of the offense over to Drew Lock, who during Thursday's practice received reps with Seattle's first-team offense. Lock, 29, is a former second-round pick who attempted just three passes during the regular season. He does have 28 career regular season starts under his belt that includes 13 starts in 2020, his second season with the Broncos.

Collins, 26, led Houston in receiving yards (1,117) and tied for the team lead in touchdown catches (six) during the regular season. It was his third straight 1,000-yard season.

The two-time Pro Bowl selection has 289 catches for 4,347 yards and 24 TDs in 66 games over his first five seasons with the Texans, who drafted him in the third round in 2021.

Collins caught three passes for 21 yards before sustaining the concussion against the Steelers. Christian Kirk stepped up in his absence, finishing with eight catches for a season-high 144 yards and a touchdown in the win.

Houston would advance to its first AFC Championship Game in franchise history should it beat the second-seeded Patriots on Sunday in Foxborough, Mass.

Robinson was the NFL's best running back this season, leading the league with 2,298 scrimmage yards. He's been such a dominant presence for the Falcons backfield in his three years with the club. His 5,648 scrimmage yards is the third-most by a player in his first three seasons in NFL history, trailing only Hall of Famers LaDainian Tomlinson (6,145) and Eric Dickerson (5,816).

He led the NFL with 413 scrimmage touches (44 more than any other player) and was second in scrimmage yards (2,126).

Taylor was exceptional in the first half of the season with five 100-yard rushing games, including a 244-yard, three-TD performance in an overtime win over Atlanta in Germany. That was one of four instances in which Taylor rushed for three scores. Unfortunately, Taylor's production trailed off after the injury to Daniel Jones . He still led the league in attempts and rush TDs but fell to third in rush yards. Taylor (2021, 2025) joined Hall of Famer Emmitt Smith (1992, 1995) as the only players in NFL history to have multiple career seasons with 1,500-plus rush yards and 18-plus rush TDs.

After signing an extension in the preseason, Cook showed his worth by leading the NFL in rushing yards. He was an absolute playmaker out of the backfield, so it was no surprise that Buffalo finished No. 1 in the league in rushing offense. Cook ended up with 12 games with 100-plus scrimmage yards (T-most in the NFL) and the Bills were 11-1 in those games. They were 1-4 when he had fewer than 100 yards, further proving his worth to that offense.

Gibbs wasn't quite the dynamo in the run game this year as he previously was in Ben Johnson's offense, but he still amassed 1,839 scrimmage yards. He was a real problem as a pass catcher, and it was great too see him evolve in that aspect of his game. He posted career highs in targets, receptions, receiving yards and receiving TDs.

Other than some early-season fumbling issues, Henry had one hell of a season at 31 years old. In fact, he has now posted back-to-back campaigns with at least 1,500 yards and 15 rush touchdowns -- no other player in NFL history has even one such season at age 30 or older. The ageless wonder continued to trounce defenses and finished the season with an absolute bang, rushing for 570 yards and six touchdowns on 85 carries over the final four games. That's 6.7 per clip.

There weren't a ton of positives for Miami's offense in 2025, but Achane did more than enough to catch my attention. He was great in every way for the Dolphins' rushing attack and continued to be a valuable asset in the pass game. There are likely to be a ton of changes this offseason -- beginning with a new head coach -- but Achane will be a mainstay and is a huge draw for whomever will lead that offense in 2026.

Fresh off a three-year extension, Williams rushed for 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns for the third consecutive season to help the Rams feature a top-10 rushing attack for the first time since 2020. Blake Corum cut into Williams' workload (Williams had 57 fewer carries in 2025 than he had in 2024) but Williams made the most of his touches. He even logged career highs 50 targets, 36 receptions, 281 receiving yards and three receiving TDs -- illustrating his improvement in the pass game. Was he worth that new contract? You bet!

Williams made the most of his one-year deal in Dallas with his career-best campaign by far. Though the Cowboys sprinkled in Malik Davis and Jaydon Blue at times, Williams was the reason they finished in the top 10 in rushing yards for the first time since 2022, when Ezekiel and Tony Pollard led the charge.

Barkley wasn't the same behind a beat up O-line in 2025.

Etienne bounced back in a big way from a disappointing 2024 campaign. He led the Jags with nearly 1,400 scrimmage yards and a career-high 13 scrimmage TDs. He also led the team with six receiving touchdowns, making him the only RB in the league to pace his team in the category.

Jacobs dealt with ankle and knee injuries late in the season, which hampered his production down the stretch. In Weeks 1-10, Jacobs averaged 21.1 touches and 93.9 scrimmage yards per game with 11 total TDs. Those numbers fell off from Week 11 on, with Jacobs averaging 13.3 touches and 61 scrimmage yards per game with three total TDs.

That allowed him to become the first Bears RB with at least 1,000 rush yards since David Montgomery in 2020. And here's one more bonus nugget for you: Swift is one of five backs drafted outside of Round 1 since 2000 with five-plus rush TDs in each of his first six seasons, joining Montgomery, Derrick Henry, Clinton Portis and yours truly.

Walker split carries with Zach Charbonnet but logged 1,000 receiving yards for the second time in his career. He's a big reason the Seahawks finished the campaign strong, as they averaged 171.3 rush yards per game in the final three weeks of the season when the division and NFC's top seed were on the line.

Dowdle made the most of his opportunity with the Panthers by posting his second consecutive 1,000-yard rushing season. The highlight of his campaign came in Weeks 5-9 when he rushed for a league-high 130.4 yards per game. His production tailed off in the season's second half, when he averaged just 42.6 rush yards per game, leaving a question mark about whether the Panthers will re-sign him in the offseason.

Brown registered career highs in carries, rush yards, targets, receptions and TD receptions in 2025. He's a dynamic player but deserves more touches in Cincinnati's pass-heavy offense. The Bengals ranked in the bottom four of the league in carries and rushing. I would love to see them play with a little more balance and get Brown, who posted 10 games with at least 90 scrimmage yards since Week 7, more attempts.

Give Hall his flowers for logging 1,000 rush yards in that offense. The fourth-year pro was easily the biggest bright spot on the 2025 Jets and should earn a big payday this offseason. He's a top-seven back when it comes to talent. With better pieces around him, he could easily rank even higher. The Jets must re-sign him.

The Titans offense showed some improvement in December, and Pollard played a big part in that success. The veteran running back rushed for 100-plus yards in three straight games -- the Titans won two of those contests -- to help him surpass 1,000 rush yards for the fourth straight campaign.

Skattebo made a huge impact on a young Giants offense prior to his season-ending ankle injury just eight games into his rookie campaign. He was the best running back in this year's rookie class and was on his way to becoming a top-10 player at the position prior to the injury, thanks to some noteworthy performances (SEE: three TDs vs. Philly). If he makes a full recovery and can stay healthy, Skattebo should build off his promising campaign next season under a new regime.

There wasn't much to get excited about in the Browns offense this season, as the unit ranked 31st in scoring and 30th in yards. The rookie class was a bright spot, though, and Judkins put some nice things on tape, including a 110-yard rushing outing in London. Despite his season ending in Week 16 with a gruesome leg injury, Judkins finished third in rush yards among rookies.

The Commanders had four running backs with starts this season and couldn't shake the injury bug at really any position. Croskey-Merritt and Chris Rodriguez Jr. took turns starting after Austin Ekeler 's season-ending injury in Week 2. JCM had a pair of notable performances in which he rushed for more than 100 yards and had multiple rush TDs (Weeks 5 and 17). The seventh-round rookie has talent but needs to find more consistency.

Dobbins was having a great season before a Lisfanc injury landed him on IR. Despite playing in 10 games, the physical vet led the Broncos in rush yards for the season. He was a great fit in Sean Payton's offense, and even with Dobbins' injury history, I would be surprised if Denver doesn't bring him back on a team-friendly deal this offseason.

Jeanty's rookie season didn't go quite as we thought it would. The Raiders underperformed in most offensive areas, starting with the offensive line, and it led to the firing of OC Chip Kelly in late November. Jeanty did put some positives on tape and I'm not going to write off his 1,321 scrimmage yards, which broke Josh Jacobs' team record for most by a Raiders rookie, but there's a lot more to be desired with this talented young back. Hopefully, we'll see just how special he is under a new regime.

Irving struggled to stay healthy a year after his rookie breakout campaign. He scored only once on the ground in 10 games and rushed for more than 4.0 yards per tote in only two of those games. Irving still led the team in carries and rush yards, which pretty much sums up the Bucs offense in 2025. The next offensive coordinator must find ways to get this backfield going.

The Patriots don't have a top-six rushing attack without the dependable backfield duo of Henderson and veteran Rhamondre Stevenson . The rookie led the team in carries, rush yards, rush TDs and scrimmage yards (1,132), and his success was highlighted by his explosiveness. Henderson posted four rush touchdowns of 50-plus yards in 2025, tied for the most by a rookie in NFL history.

Stevenson slots in right behind his teammate. He has an equally dynamic skill set but was banged up some and had a slower start to the campaign. In his first 10 games, Stevenson averaged 32.4 rush yards per game and 3.2 yards per carry. In his final four games, the vet had 69.8 rush yards per game and 9.6 yards per carry. It was nice to see a strong finish.

After a superb 2024 campaign in which the Panthers extended Hubbard midseason, his production dropped significantly in 2025 when partnering with Rico Dowdle in the backfield. Hubbard lost the starting job midway through 2025 and finished the year with only one rush TD and without a 100-yard rushing performance (he had four such games in 2024).

In his first season as the starter, Warren posted career highs in carries, rush yards, rush TDs and receiving TDs. He mainly struggled with consistency, posting only two 100-yard rushing performances in Weeks 7 and 16. As I mentioned last month, Pittsburgh needs an improved run game in 2026, so the pressure is on Warren to become more consistent in his second year as the team's lead back.

The rookie was a consistent player for the Texans, though his 3.6 yards per carry were the second-fewest among 52 players with at least 100 carries in 2025. Marks showed a lot more in his first pro season than I saw from him at USC.

The sixth-round rookie found his way onto the field after early-season injuries to both Najee Harris and Omarion Hampton . Vidal, who rushed for an impressive 124 yards on 18 carries in his first-career start in Week 6, ended up leading the team in carries and rush yards.

Mason was great in his first season in Minnesota and led the team in most rushing categories out of the backfield. The Vikings ranked in the bottom six in rushing attempts -- surprising considering all of the QB troubles -- and Mason's 4.8 rush yards per attempt should've swayed Kevin O'Connell to lean more heavily on the physical fourth-year back. I'm curious to see if O'Connell uses Mason more in his second season with the club.

The rookie was a perfect fit for Ben Johnson's offense and a great complement to veteran Swift. Monangai gradually worked his way onto the field, earning his first double-digit carry outing in Week 6 and finishing the campaign with two 100-yard performances. Monangai and Swift became the second pair of Bears RBs to each have 750-plus rush yards in the same season, joining Hall of Famer Walter Payton and Roland Harper in 1978. Monangai showed a lot of promise in Year 1, a great foundation of what's to come in this offense.

The Chiefs didn't have much of a run game in 2025 as the team shuffled through backs frequently. An injury to Isiah Pacheco led to Hunt gaining a bigger role, and he ended up leading the team in carries, rush yards and rush TDs. Hunt is a free agent and so is Pacheco. This backfield needs a reset.

After jumping on the scene as a rookie, Tracy's production dipped in Year 2. He began the season as the starter but quickly lost that job to rookie Cam Skattebo , only to reclaim it when Skattebo was lost for the season in late October. Tracy had one 100-yard rushing performance (Week 18) and didn't elevate the struggling offense enough when he was on the field.

Gainwell played a huge role in the Steelers' dink-and-dunk pass offense.

The rookie took on the role of featured back after J.K. Dobbins went down with an injury in Week 10, averaging 16.9 touches per game from that point through the end of the regular season. He's gotten good volume but his efficiency in the run game hasn't been all that great (3.7 yards per carry). I will say that he's been a great asset in the pass game and a beast near the goal line. He led all Broncos and rookies with 12 scrimmage touchdowns in 2025.

Allgeier didn't get much shine with Bijan heavily featured in the Falcons attack, but he served as a great change-of-pace back and made his money in the red zone with a team-high eight rush touchdowns. If Atlanta lets Allgeier hit free agency, he'll likely earn an upgraded role on another team.

I'm still surprised how little Kellen Moore used a healthy Kamara early in the season.

White's production has decreased in each of the last three seasons. It's telling that, in the games White started when RB1 Bucky Irving was sidelined, Sean Tucker got a lot of carries.

Yes, the Green Bay Packers were hit with some difficult injuries in 2025.

Guess what?

Their injury situation was no better or worse than most, and it placed them in the middle of the NFL in two key categories.

According to Sports Info Solutions, Green Bay finished 13th in the NFL in most games missed to injury.

The website also measures “Total Points Missed” due to injury. To determine this statistic, the website measures how valuable each player was to his team’s ability to score or prevent points, using Expected Points Added as the currency. That figure is then multiplied by the number of games missed due to injury.

Green Bay finished 14th in Total Points Missed.

The Packers finished the year with 15 players on the injured reserve list. Alphabetically, that list included safety Zayne Anderson, tight end John FitzPatrick, offensive tackle Travis Glover, cornerback Kamal Hadden, cornerback Nate Hobbs, center Elgton Jenkins, offensive guard/tackle Donovan Jennings, tight end Tucker Kraft, running back MarShawn Lloyd, wide receiver/cornerback Bo Melton, defensive end Micah Parsons, defensive tackle Jordan Riley, linebacker Kristian Welch, wide receiver Savion Williams and defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt.

Parsons was without question Green Bay’s best player and losing him was undoubtedly an enormous blow to the defense. In fact, Green Bay went 0-5 after Parsons was lost to a torn ACL midway through the Packers’ Week 15 loss to Denver.

Kraft was arguably the Packers’ second-most important player on offense after quarterback Jordan Love. And Wyatt was arguably Green Bay’s third most important defensive player after Parsons and linebacker Edgerrin Cooper.

Jenkins was a starter at center, but the Packers’ offensive line play actually improved when Sean Rhyan took over at that spot. The rest of that the Packers’ I.R. list consisted of backups and special teams players.

Still, that didn’t stop Green Bay from playing the injury card whenever possible.

“To be at your best, you need everybody available,” Green Bay head coach Matt LaFleur said. “And we always talk about your best ability is your availability and it's tough when you lose some guys.”

Chicago missed the most games due to injury with 336. Detroit was second at 326, while Buffalo (297), Arizona (296) and Pittsburgh (279) rounded out the top five.

Green Bay was 13th with 237 games missed due to injury.

In the “Total Points Missed” category, Arizona was first with 266, followed by Washington (230), San Francisco (200), Buffalo (190) and Miami (182).

Green Bay was 14th with 136.

Perception is reality, though, which is why the Packers tried selling the notion that injuries ruined their season. Instead, the reality was their injury situation placed them in the middle of the pack.

“I don’t think it made it easier,” LaFleur said of the injuries. “But we’re not going to live in that world because all they are is excuses. We’re going to take the guys that we have, we’re going to put them in the best position possible and, unfortunately, we didn’t do a good enough job of that.”

The Buffalo Bills’ hopes of making it to their first Super Bowl since the 1993 season have been dinged and dented as they get set to play the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round.

First, Josh Allen was one of 15 players listed on the Bills’ injury report to start the week. Allen was dealing with three injuries simultaneously — a foot, knee and right finger. He was limited in practice on Tuesday but was a full participant on Wednesday.

Even as banged up as he is, the ball has been in Allen’s hands to make magic on the field. He did that against the Jacksonville Jaguars as he scored three times, including a passing touchdown to Dalton Kincaid with 8:56 left in the game and a rushing score to put Buffalo ahead with about 1:04 left.

The Broncos, who have one of the best defenses in the NFL, are highly aware of what Allen can bring to the table. He had 272 passing yards and two touchdowns in their matchup last year.

""One thing we need to eliminate is his second-chance opportunities,"" Broncos cornerback Patrick Surtain II said of Allen. ""He thrives off that and finding opportunities even if the play is not there. He is a great player, so we have to game plan and eliminate the explosives.""

Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph gets the privilege of scheming up a defensive plan to stop the Bills.

GIANTS WORKING TO FINALIZE DEAL TO MAKE JOHN HARBAUGH NEXT HEAD COACH: REPORTS

""His legs are special, he's got that size, he can make every single throw. That's not different for us, but you can't simulate it, obviously. If you could, you would. But you can't,"" Joseph said. ""There’s one Josh Allen, and he lives in Buffalo.""

For all of Allen’s greatness, the injury report is extensive and he lost another weapon.

Bills wide receiver Tyrell Shavers will miss the rest of the playoffs after he suffered a torn knee ligament, head coach Sean McDermott said on Tuesday. The news came a day after McDermott said Gabe Davis had suffered a similar injury.

Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman and Brandin Cooks represent the healthy receivers on the team’s official depth chart. Mecole Hardman and Stephen Gosnell are candidates to be promoted to the active roster. The team also added Kristian Wilkerson to the practice squad.

Kincaid (knee/calf), Ty Johnson (ankle) and Curtis Samuel (elbow) are the other injured offensive players on the roster. Samuel is on the reserve/injured list.

Terrel Bernard (calf), A.J. Epenesa (neck), Maxwell Hairston (ankle), Damar Hamlin (pectoral), Matt Milano (ankle), Ed Oliver (bicep), Jordan Poyer (hamstring), Greg Rousseau (back), Shaq Thompson (neck) and Matt Prater (right quad/right calf) are also listed on the report.

""What we need to focus on is what's in front of us … and that's handling the things that we can handle and control,"" McDermott said, via the team’s website. ""It's next man up. That's pretty stone cold what it is and what has to happen here for us.""

Although true, there are different levels. Making the playoffs is the first level of success toward the ultimate goal of winning the Super Bowl. Fourteen teams qualify for the postseason while 18 teams are left watching the tournament from home.

Eight of the 18 teams — nearly half! — are searching for a new head coach, with the Pittsburgh Steelers joining the search for Mike Tomlin’s successor after their wild-card loss. Although the offseason began on the same weekend for those 18 teams, the mood entering the offseason varies greatly.

That’s where our focus lies today. We are going to examine how miserable things really are for the 18 non-playoff teams. To do so, we have a subjective, non-scientific formula that measures two factors: how the 2025 season went and the overall future outlook of the situation. With that, we have our Misery Index, a more nuanced way to gauge the situation of a franchise than simply looking at the standings. The factors considered when assigning the grade for future outlook were potential new voices/subtractions in the front office and coaching staff, cap space to work with this offseason and draft picks available in 2026 and 2027.

Note: The higher the number, the more positive it is for the team. The ranking is based on the sum of both numbers.

18. Detroit Lions

2025 season: 6/10

Future outlook: 9/10

The Dan Campbell era has set a new standard for Lions fans, and missing the playoffs is not acceptable. Considering the Lions went from 15-2 in 2024 to out of the postseason in 2025, this season was a disappointment. However, the Lions posted a winning record of 9-8 and were the only top-10 team in the league in point differential to miss the playoffs — all after losing both coordinators. They didn’t meet their new standard, but it’s far from panic time. All of the core pieces are under contract, and while you’d love more draft capital, they do have their first- and second-round picks. The most important thing will be getting the offensive coordinator hire right.

17. Baltimore Ravens

2025 season: 5/10

Future outlook: 8/10

The injuries, especially to Lamar Jackson, helped sink the 2025 season, but the Ravens didn’t feel like a team with much potential — even if Tyler Loop had made that field goal and they had snuck into the playoffs. Obviously, the head coaching hire will contribute strongly to how the future outlook is viewed, and the same can be said for every team with an opening. But the Ravens have an elite quarterback in his prime and some competent pieces in place on both sides of the ball. That’s pressure on the next coach to produce instant results.

16. Kansas City Chiefs

2025 season: 4/10

Future outlook: 8/10

You can’t really fall below an 8 on the overall outlook if you have prime Patrick Mahomes on your roster, but the timing of his injury is concerning. It’s also concerning that Mahomes played almost the entire season and it still wasn’t good enough to get the Chiefs in the playoffs (yes, Kansas City was still alive in the game in which Mahomes got hurt, but the playoffs had already become a long shot). There are a lot of question marks on offense this offseason, from Mahomes’ health to Travis Kelce’s future to how reliable Rashee Rice can be, both from an on-field perspective and with the off-field concerns. Andy Reid is one of the greatest coaches of his generation and now the longest-tenured active coach in the league, but he has some serious evaluation to do on that side of the ball.

15. Cincinnati Bengals

2025 season: 4/10

Future outlook: 7/10

Losing Joe Burrow for such a significant chunk ended any hope for this season, but as Cincinnati’s 2024 campaign showed, there needs to be more than just great quarterback play and offensive fireworks. Right now, the defense is so bad that there’s no margin for error on offense. There needs to be a significant defensive overhaul to get the Bengals back up as an AFC power.

14. Dallas Cowboys

2025 season: 4/10

Future outlook: 6/10

The good news is that Dak Prescott showed that when he’s healthy, he’s capable of playing at an MVP level. The bad news is he did that for a large chunk of 2025, and the Cowboys were still eliminated from the playoffs with a few weeks left to play. The defensive coordinator hire will get all the buzz, but they need to upgrade their personnel on that side, too. Offensively, the George Pickens extension will be under the spotlight, and he has the same agent as Micah Parsons, so get your popcorn ready.

13. New Orleans Saints

2025 season: 4/10

Future outlook: 6/10

There’s an easy way to view the Saints’ 2025 season: 1-7 with Spencer Rattler as the starting quarterback and then 5-4 with rookie Tyler Shough as the starter, with two of those four Shough losses one-possession defeats. The Saints hired a new head coach last offseason in Kellen Moore and now have a quarterback to pair with him. They still have another year of dealing with the Sean Payton salary-cap hell, so it’s easy to be optimistic right now about where they’ll be in the next couple of years.

12. Tampa Bay Buccaneers

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 6/10

The 2-7 post-bye week record was jarring and a stark contrast from the 6-2 start to the season. Tampa Bay has some core players on both sides of the ball — Mike Evans and Lavonte David — getting up there. One thing that has snuck up on them is Baker Mayfield’s contract. Next season is the final year of Mayfield’s current deal. He’s worth it for his current price tag, but the question will be how much he’s looking for on his next deal, and how high the Bucs are willing to go, especially with uncertainty looming at head coach.

11. Washington Commanders

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 6/10

Washington’s magical 2024 season came crashing down in 2025, and that was with one of the oldest rosters in the NFL. Quarterback Jayden Daniels had three stints of absence due to injuries, but Washington’s problems extend beyond that. The defense was downright atrocious, finishing second worst in the league in total defensive EPA, ahead of only the Cowboys.

10. New York Giants

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 6/10

You could highlight the importance of the head coaching hire for any of the teams looking for one, but there’s a different emphasis for the Giants. They made John Harbaugh their priority from the start and, as of Wednesday night, were working to finalize a deal to make him their next head coach. Coupling Harbaugh with what Jaxson Dart showed as a rookie in 2025 could deliver a turnaround in fairly short order for the Giants.

9. Atlanta Falcons

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 5/10

It’s a shame they started playing their best football after being mathematically eliminated from the postseason in early December because the division was as winnable as it gets. The bigger shame is that they don’t even have their first-round pick in 2026, as they dealt that to the Los Angeles Rams last year. There are big decisions to be made at general manager, head coach and the quarterback room, namely Kirk Cousins’ contract and future in Atlanta. Those are arguably the three most high-profile positions in an organization. No pressure, Matt Ryan.

8. Tennessee Titans

2025 season: 2/10

Future outlook: 5/10

After one win in their first 12 games, the Titans had two wins in their final five. Cam Ward had just one interception over the final nine games of the season. Tennessee has a top-five draft pick again this year and should focus on building around Ward, who showed flashes as a rookie of being a franchise quarterback. There’s a lot of work to be done by the front office and the incoming head coach, but prioritizing Ward’s development should be front of mind.

7. Miami Dolphins

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 4/10

The Dolphins went 7-10 in 2025, and that record somehow feels a lot better than what the season felt like. Within a stretch of five wins in six games, the general manager got fired. Mike McDaniel was on the hot seat when the team started 2-7, then Tua Tagovailoa got benched when the team lost three of its last four games. Miami has already hired a new GM in Jon-Eric Sullivan, is searching for a new head coach after firing McDaniel and has some major question marks, including Tagovailoa and his gargantuan contract and wide receiver Tyreek Hill.

6. Minnesota Vikings

2025 season: 3/10

Future outlook: 4/10

The quarterback they had in 2024, who led them to a 14-3 season, helped the Seattle Seahawks to the No. 1 seed in the NFC in 2025. Meanwhile, J.J. McCarthy did not provide encouraging results when he was on the field. If Brian Flores leaves in the current hiring cycle, it will also be a big blow to the defense. On top of all of that, the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers aren’t going anywhere, and the Lions are likely to rebound.

5. Cleveland Browns

2025 season: 2/10

Future outlook: 4/10

As it has for decades, the problem at quarterback continues to linger over this franchise. It doesn’t have a definitive answer, and neither Dillon Gabriel nor Shedeur Sanders showed enough to commit to building around them. The positivity has mostly to do with the defense, spearheaded by Myles Garrett. But the offense also has some nice pieces at the skill positions, particularly Quinshon Judkins and Harold Fannin Jr. None of it will matter, though, if the quarterback is an issue.

4. Indianapolis Colts

2025 season: 2/10

Future outlook: 3/10

The talent on the roster keeps the Colts from being ranked worse on this list, but it’s hard to imagine a team lower on the vibes measure. On Nov. 3, the Colts were 7-2, with growing confidence in Daniel Jones as their future, Jonathan Taylor getting some MVP buzz and their full load of premium draft picks. The Colts acquired Sauce Gardner in a trade that cost them two first-round picks and lost Jones to an Achilles tear. Taylor has put on a lot of mileage through six years in the NFL, too. They go into the offseason having lost their last seven games, not knowing when Jones will be ready and how effective he’ll be when he returns, and without a first-round pick in the draft.

3. Las Vegas Raiders

2025 season: 1/10

Future outlook: 3/10

The Raiders were atrocious in 2025, and that’s not even just about wins and losses. Their head coach and quarterback were win-now veteran pieces, but most of the roster was nowhere close. They drafted a talented running back very high to put behind a terrible offensive line. They also angered their best player by shutting him down for the season against his wishes. On the bright side, they have money to spend and the No. 1 pick.

2. New York Jets

2025 season: 1/10

Future outlook: 3/10

There were four teams tied for the worst record in the league this season at 3-14. The Raiders got the tiebreakers necessary to land the No. 1 pick, but if I had a vote, the Jets would probably win the distinction for the worst team in the NFL. Going a full season without an interception is wild, especially when the head coach is a former Pro Bowl defensive back. The offense set records of ineptitude on what seemed like a weekly basis. The silver lining for the future is the work to stockpile draft picks. The Jets have two first-round picks and two second-round picks this year, then three first-round picks in 2027. They have to hit on them, but the ammunition is there.

1. Arizona Cardinals

2025 season: 1/10

Future outlook: 2/10

Aside from Trey McBride, the Cardinals’ biggest bright spot on offense was the emergence of 2023 third-round pick Michael Wilson. While the revelation of Wilson was nice, it was offset somewhat by the disappointment of Marvin Harrison Jr., the No. 4 pick in 2024, and the continued regression of Kyler Murray. The Cardinals have Murray on a hefty contract but clearly don’t believe he’s the answer at quarterback anymore. They play in a division in which the other three teams were all in contention for the top seed in the conference for the last few weeks of the season and reached the divisional round of the playoffs. It’s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/14192418/0115nflmisery.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-15 17:02:02.168186

In a lawsuit as legally significant as it is titillating, former NFL player Matt Kalil is suing his former wife, Haley Kalil, claiming that she violated his right to privacy during a livestreamed interview by describing his genitals as being too big. Haley Kalil, a social media personality with millions of followers, gave the interview with Marlon Lundgren Garcia, another popular online figure with millions of followers. During the 12-minute interview, Haley implicitly referenced Matt’s genitalia, claiming that his penis was like “two Coke cans, maybe even a third,” and described the daunting dick as the primary reason for the couple’s divorce.

Perhaps because the interview remains widely available on YouTube, Haley has not publicly disputed the facts alleged in the complaint, which go far beyond the aluminum can comparison. She claimed that sex with Matt was “painful,” “impossible,” and left her “in tears.” She added that the couple tried “medical and therapeutic intervention,” and that the physical challenges made their sexual relationship “unhealthy” and were a major factor contributing to the couple’s subsequent divorce. Given the broad reach of Garcia’s livestream, these intimate details were then spread to many different sources, amplifying the harm that Matt alleges.

That harm is firmly anchored in a branch of privacy law that has long been recognized, but has fallen into disfavor in recent years. The law of personal injury, while primarily concerned with physical injuries, also protects certain dignitary interests, including reputation (the law of defamation), emotional well-being, and four distinct categories of privacy. Only one of these is alleged to apply in this case: public disclosure of private facts.

But what facts are private? Given the explosion of news and entertainment outlets—where every information source from network television and national press down to a TikTok personality with a few hundred followers scrambles for the public’s attention—it’s easy to conclude that nothing about us is private. Everything, it seems, is fair game for virality. And the law has indeed moved strongly in the direction of valuing the public’s right to know over individuals’ privacy—especially when the information concerns people who fall into what’s now the vast but amorphous category of “public figures.” Not surprisingly, then, there are not many recent cases that claim a private fact was maliciously made public.

Yet it’s a mistake to conclude that everything about us is fair game for public consumption. The Second Restatement of Torts, which many courts rely on in creating and interpreting legal rules, strikes a sensible balance between privacy and the public’s right to know. Publicizing the private life of another person is actionable if the matter publicized is of a kind that A) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and B) is not of legitimate public interest. Sensible, but not easy to apply—at least not the second requirement.

We can rely on a jury to determine what a reasonable person would find offensive. Many people would be offended by having this fact bandied about—especially when the Coke-can commentary is part of a larger discussion of the serious problems Haley tied to the size statement.

But the harder problem lies in determining what counts as a matter of legitimate public interest and what does not. This question is typically resolved by a judge, not the jury, and it’s only the most private of facts that today’s courts are likely to protect. What are such facts? In a federal appellate case involving an unsuccessful privacy claim, the distinguished Judge Richard Posner provided a helpful catalog of information that is definitely private and that would be “mortifying” if disclosed, including depictions of bodily functions, nude photos, and descriptions of a person’s sexual activities: “The desire for privacy,” he added, “is a mysterious but deep fact about human personality … that deserves … legal protection.” And that’s true even of the most public figures, such as Matt Kalil. He’s entitled to marital privacy, as well.

What are the damages from such disclosure, though? Cannily, the complaint names two quite separate categories, which can be seen as mirroring each other. On the one hand, the plaintiff claims that he and his family have suffered ridicule and that his dignity, peace of mind, and enjoyment of life have been compromised. Matt is seeking “in excess of $75,000” for his alleged pain and suffering, emotional distress, and harm to his reputation. But at the tail end of the complaint, he flips the switch and requests that Haley be required to cough up the financial gain she’s alleged to have realized from sharing these private facts, unjust enrichment acquired though “increased viewership, increased engagement, and monetization through various social medial platforms and … coverage.” It would be “inequitable and unjust,” Matt claims, to allow Haley to retain the benefits of her wrongful conduct. In other words, his loss of privacy and dignity was her gain. But not for long, if the claim succeeds.

Matt Kalil’s complaint reserves the right to seek punitive damages, as well. I hope he does, and that the jury sees fit to punish this kind of conduct. More generally (and based on what’s known now), this claim should succeed. There has to be some kind of private space we are all permitted to occupy, even in 2026. This case might serve valuable public interests by discouraging this kind of lurid oversharing and by beginning to push back a bit on the idea that there’s nowhere to hide.",https://compote.slate.com/images/c694dfbc-8df7-474e-9d81-52b46e23bfe6.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2026-01-15 17:02:06.481906

PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota Wild defenseman Jonas Brodin is week to week with a nagging lower-body injury, coach John Hynes confirmed Thursday.
He missed four games in mid-December with an injury that Hynes indicated is related and something the team has been monitoring closely.
“It didn’t happen in one game,” Hynes said.
“He’s played some solid hockey,” Hynes said.
… He’s played an efficient game.” Brodin, who has played in 42 of the Wild’s 47 games this season, has been injured often throughout his career because of the tough minutes he plays.","ST. PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota Wild defenseman Jonas Brodin is week to week with a nagging lower-body injury, coach John Hynes confirmed Thursday. The big question now is whether his availability for the Olympics is in jeopardy.

Hynes wouldn’t go so far as to predict that.

Brodin, the team’s shutdown left-shot blueliner, has been dealing with this injury for a while, but it’s just now getting to the point that he’s being shut down, with the team seeking further information. He missed four games in mid-December with an injury that Hynes indicated is related and something the team has been monitoring closely.

“It didn’t happen in one game,” Hynes said. “It’s something that I think has been building up a little bit.”

In the meantime, the Wild flipped Matt Kiersted for right-shot David Spacek from AHL Iowa ahead of Thursday’s game against the Winnipeg Jets at Grand Casino Arena. Spacek, the son of longtime NHLer Jaroslav Spacek, will make his long-anticipated NHL debut on a third pair with Daemon Hunt — less than a month before he’s set to represent Czechia in the Olympics.

With Brodin out, Minnesota will elevate left-shot Jake Middleton to the second pair with Jared Spurgeon against the Jets. Zach Bogosian (lower body) will miss his fifth consecutive game with a foot injury and didn’t skate Thursday after skating earlier this week. But Hynes indicated that Bogosian and injured center Joel Eriksson Ek will be on the upcoming trip to Buffalo, Toronto and Montreal.

Spacek, 22, had a terrific career with Sherbrooke of the QMJHL, being named the league’s defensive rookie of the year in 2021-22. The Wild drafted him in the fifth round in 2022. He’s in his third season with Iowa and has scored 10 goals and 62 points in 168 games there. He won a gold medal with Czechia at the 2024 World Championship and was outstanding in two World Juniors appearances, winning silver in 2023.

“He’s played some solid hockey,” Hynes said. “He’s a good puck-moving defenseman. … He’s played an efficient game.”

Brodin, who has played in 42 of the Wild’s 47 games this season, has been injured often throughout his career because of the tough minutes he plays. He dealt with injuries throughout last season, including a shoulder injury. He was then cleared to play in the World Championship, though the organization tried to talk him out of going. He played, aggravated the injury and ultimately underwent surgery in Colorado in June.

He missed most of camp as part of his recovery and the first game of the season.

The latest injury could lead the Wild to try to convince Brodin not to play in the Olympics, where he’s set to join teammates Eriksson Ek, Filip Gustavsson and Jesper Wallstedt on Team Sweden.

“We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it,” Hynes said. “That’d be between Billy (Guerin) and Jonas. Right now, we’ll just see where he’s at and exactly what it is. There needs to be more things looked at in order for us to get to that point. Maybe he’s ready before the Olympics; maybe he’s not. We don’t know at this point out in time. But let’s let it play out a little bit and see truly what’s going on.”

If Brodin can’t go, several other Swedish defensemen who were initially snubbed could replace him, including the Edmonton Oilers’ Mattias Ekholm, who played for the team at the 4 Nations Face-Off, the Boston Bruins’ Hampus Lindholm and the Detroit Red Wings’ Simon Edvinsson.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/15123722/GettyImages-2207264245-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-15 15:01:36.480849

Flagg twisted his left ankle while trying to defend Nuggets guard Peyton Watson’s drive to the rim. Flagg initially attempted to play through the injury, but after halftime, he remained behind in the locker room and never returned.

Dallas listed Flagg as doubtful for Thursday’s game against the Utah Jazz. Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said Wednesday that he didn’t know whether his star rookie forward would miss the game.

“He stepped on someone’s foot,” Kidd said. “Last game, he twisted his ankle, too. We decided to hold him for the second half. So, next man up.”

Flagg has been one of the Mavericks’ most durable players this season, missing only one game. He tweaked his left ankle Monday against the Brooklyn Nets but returned and led Dallas to a 113-105 win.

Flagg, the No. 1 pick in last summer’s draft, has been impressive this season, averaging 19.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 4.3 assists and earning two Western Conference Rookie of the Month awards. He leads the Mavericks in total minutes, points, rebounds, assists and steals.

Flagg’s injury Wednesday came one day after the Mavericks announced Anthony Davis would miss at least six weeks. Davis suffered ligament damage in his left hand in a Jan. 8 game against the Jazz.

The Mavericks played most of the second half Wednesday without two starters. Early in the third quarter, center Daniel Gafford limped off after he aggravated a nagging right ankle injury and never returned. Gafford initially hurt his right ankle on the Mavericks’ first day of training camp. He has already missed 12 games this season.

The Mavericks (15-26) are on a 30-win pace at the halfway point of the regular season. They are in 12th place in the Western Conference.

“This is a hard time for us,” Kidd said. “We have had a lot of injuries. … We have been hurt since day one of training camp. This is the norm. The character has been displayed in tough times of being down, but we keep fighting.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/15010625/USATSI_28009532-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-15 16:01:36.234321

If Gonzalez were to shadow anyone on the Texans in coverage, it would be Collins, who wasn’t spotted at the beginning of Wednesday’s practice.
If Jennings is not activated from IR, then the Patriots could elevate Johnson from the practice squad for Sunday’s game against the Texans.","FOXBORO — Patriots cornerback Christian Gonzalez was present for the start of Wednesday’s practice in a non-contact jersey and participated in initial drills, indicating he is already in the fourth phase of the NFL’s five-phase concussion protocol.

Gonzalez was officially listed as limited in Wednesday’s injury report.

With two practices and four days left before Sunday’s divisional-round playoff game against Houston, Gonzalez needs only to be cleared for full practice participation before he can then be cleared for game action. Gonzalez was diagnosed with a concussion in the second half of last Sunday’s Wild Card playoff win over the Chargers.

His return would significantly boost a Patriots defense preparing for a Texans offense that may be without No. 1 receiver Nico Collins, who sustained his own concussion last Monday versus Pittsburgh.

Defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga returned to practice in a limited capacity for the first time since hurting his foot at Baltimore on Dec. 21. He returned next to injured backup running back Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol), whose 21-day window has been opened for a potential activation off injured reserve later this year. Jennings also donned a non-contact jersey and was listed as limited.

Relatedly, the Pats released running back D’Ernest Johnson from their active roster earlier this week and re-signed him to the practice squad.

Patriots right tackle Morgan Moses, tight end Hunter Henry, outside linebacker Anfernee Jennings and backup offensive lineman Thayer Munford Jr. were all absent for the start of practice. Moses (knee) and Munford (knee) did not participate in practice. Henry (knee) and Jennings (knee) arrived at practice late and were listed as limited. Outside linebacker Harold Landry (knee) was also limited in Wednesday’s session.

Gonzalez was named to his first Pro Bowl this season after being named a second-team All-Pro last year. He missed the first three weeks of the season with a hamstring injury but has started every game since, registering 69 tackles, 10 pass breakups and one tackle for loss.

Playing opposite fellow starting cornerback Carlton Davis, Gonzalez allowed 35 catches on 80 targets for 357 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions this season, including Sunday’s wild-card round win over the Chargers.

Gonzalez was one of the Patriots’ best players in that game, holding Chargers receivers catchless on four targets with two pass breakups. It was the second consecutive game and the third this season that Gonzalez did not allow a reception.

“Gonzo continues to play at a high level,” head coach Mike Vrabel said Monday. “Those are the expectations that he has for himself and that we have for him. … We appreciate what he’s done and his willingness to line up different places. It’s not quite as easy as — we’ve been through this, but different coverages, locations, motions and things like that. So, he’s handled that all really well. Hopefully, we’ll get him back.”

Gonzalez, Davis and Marcus Jones, who primarily plays in the slot, are the Patriots’ starting cornerbacks. The team also has Charles Woods and Kobee Minor to serve as depth on the 53-man roster. Alex Austin, who continued to practice Wednesday, is eligible to be activated from injured reserve. Miles Battle also provides depth on the practice squad.

If Gonzalez were to shadow anyone on the Texans in coverage, it would be Collins, who wasn’t spotted at the beginning of Wednesday’s practice. The Texans are deep at wide receiver with rookies Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel and veterans Christian Kirk and Xavier Hutchinson ready to take on bigger roles. Collins is clearly the Texans’ best pass catcher, however, with three consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons.

The Patriots have an open spot on their 53-man roster, which could be filled by Terrell Jennings or Austin. The team has just two running backs on their 53-man roster, after releasing Johnson, in Rhamondre Stevenson and rookie TreVeyon Henderson. They’ve gone into every game this season with three active running backs. If Jennings is not activated from IR, then the Patriots could elevate Johnson from the practice squad for Sunday’s game against the Texans.

The Patriots can elevate up to two players from the practice squad. They can elevate players in the playoffs an unlimited number of times.

They elevated defensive tackle Leonard Taylor III and wide receiver Jeremiah Webb last week. Webb wound up being inactive, however, since Kayshon Boutte, who was questionable with a hamstring injury, suited up and played. The Patriots might not need Taylor this week if Tonga returns to action. Taylor has been effective, however, so the team could still elect to elevate him and play him over rookie Eric Gregory.",https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tsnl43.jpg?w=1024&h=764,N,,2026-01-15 13:02:11.462748

Compiling his annual list of the rookie classes that produced the most for their teams for ESPN, Aaron Schatz ranked the 2025 Saints crop at the top of the heap.

Schatz is an analytical pioneer who created the DVOA metric for Football Outsiders and now works for FTN Network. He based this year’s rookie rankings on several data points, starting with Sports Info Solutions’ Total Points system, which attempts to assign value to individual players. He then adjusted his rankings based on positional importance, ESPN tracking data and his own DVOA formula.

These rankings are meant to organize the draft classes by the impact the rookies had on this year’s teams rather than trying to assess future value or potential — which hurt teams such as the Jacksonville Jaguars, who only got seven games out of No. 2 pick Travis Hunter.

New Orleans ranked No. 1 on Schatz’s list because of the contributions it received from quarterback Tyler Shough and left tackle Kelvin Banks — its top two picks — but also because several other members of the class contributed in a positive way.

Some other sources back up Schatz’s rankings: Pro Football Reference keeps a proprietary statistic (Approximate Value, or AV) that attempts to quantify a player’s value to a team in a given season.

This year, Pro Football Reference found 35 players from the 2025 draft class to post an AV of 6 or better. The Saints accounted for three of them — Shough (7), Banks (6) and safety Jonas Sanker (7). The only other teams with three or more players to reach that benchmark were the Patriots (4) and Bears (3).

Each of the nine players the Saints selected in the 2025 draft appeared in at least one game this season, though seventh rounders Moliki Matavao and Fadil Diggs spent most of the season on the practice squad, and third-rounder Vernon Broughton missed the final 15 games of the season with a hip injury.

Shough was the gem of the Saints class — for the 2025 season, at least — having recently been named a finalist for the NFL’s Offensive Rookie of the Year despite starting only nine games.

He finished a close second to Giants QB Jaxson Dart (91.7) in QB rating (91.3) and led all rookie passers in passing yards per game (216.7) and completion percentage (67.6 %). Most important, Shough also won five of his nine starts — the only rookie to lead his team to a winning record in his starts.

In Shough and Banks, the Saints found two foundational players at premium positions to accelerate their rebuild with their top two picks. But they also hit on some defensive starters on Days 2 and 3 of the draft.

Sanker played solid football throughout the season after taking over as the starting safety in Week 2 following Julian Blackmon’s season-ending shoulder injury. The third rounder was one of five rookies to record at least 80 tackles and two interceptions this season.

Quincy Riley took over as a starting outside corner after the first quarter of the season and impressed the Saints with his play-making ability, finishing fourth among NFL rookies in passes defended (10). Linebacker Danny Stutsman finished eighth among rookie linebackers in tackles (53) despite playing only 19 % of the Saints defensive snaps.

The Saints were one of three NFC South teams to rank in Schatz’s top six, with the Carolina Panthers and Atlanta Falcons checking in at the No. 5 and 6 spots, respectively. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers checked in at No. 16.

Carolina (Tetairoa McMillan) and Tampa Bay (Emeka Egbuka) both drafted receivers who will at least draw consideration for Offensive Rookie of the Year — and in McMillan’s case, probably win it. Atlanta, meanwhile, found three impact defensive players in James Pearce (rookie-high 10.5 sacks), Xavier Watts (rookie-high 5 interceptions) and Jalon Walker.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/95/89529828-68cd-521f-b614-1bda55822bf2/69487173bcfe8.image.jpg?crop=1631%2C857%2C0%2C126&resize=1200%2C631&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-15 17:02:10.480679

Kirk's career-high 144 receiving yards helped fuel the Texans' 30-6 win and set a franchise postseason record, eclipsing Collins' mark from last year's wild-card win over the Los Angeles Chargers.

""I was really happy for Christian knowing the type of guy that he is,"" Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said. ""He's one of the best guys in our locker room and he works extremely hard throughout the week. He's been grinding all season to be an impact player for us. I'm happy it worked out for him in one of our biggest games of the year.""

Quarterback C.J. Stroud leaned on Kirk as he grinded through an uncharacteristic night in which he threw an interception and lost two fumbles. The three turnovers were his most in a game since his rookie season.

But Stroud and Kirk were still able to execute on pivotal third downs, with the Pro Bowl quarterback targeting Kirk nine times for 126 yards and a touchdown. Kirk especially came up big after Collins and Justin Watson entered the concussion protocol and were ruled out in the second half.

""I think he's one of the best in the league,"" Stroud said of Kirk. ""We've tried to find ways to get him the ball. ... I told him it's not easy being in the year he's in [and] not having the production, stats-wise. For him to keep going week in and week out, prepping the right way, to see it pay oﬀ was really dope. Super proud of him.""

The regular season was up and down for Kirk, whom Houston traded a 2025 seventh-round pick to acquire from the Jacksonville Jaguars in the offseason. Kirk, in his eighth year, finished with a career-low 239 receiving yards in the regular season, where he missed four games with hamstring injuries. His 64 receiving yards in Week 5 against the Baltimore Ravens was his high in the regular season.

As for Collins' availability for Sunday's divisional round game against the New England Patriots on Sunday (3 p.m. ET, ESPN/ABC), Ryans said, ""We'll see how the week goes."" The Pro Bowl wideout didn't practice Wednesday, and the last time he suffered a concussion -- in Week 7 against the Seattle Seahawks -- he didn't play the following week.

""We're one unit, and any of us at any moment can step up and be able to fill the void, and make plays when they are needed,"" Kirk said.

England take on Wales in three and a half weeks, with their Six Nations squad set to be named next week.

After the opening round of action, England travel to Scotland on 14 February and then take on Ireland at Twickenham on 21 February before the Six Nations' rest week.

Smith came off the bench in the opening-round defeat by Ireland in last year's competition and was promoted to the starting XV for the remaining four matches of England's campaign.

Steve Borthwick's side finished second in a hugely encouraging campaign, and Smith won selection for the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia over the summer.

However, while Smith endured a disappointing time with the Lions, unable to exert pressure on Finn Russell for a Test spot, George Ford impressed in England's Tests against Argentina and the United States.

Ford was preferred during the autumn, starting at 10 in victories over Australia, New Zealand and Argentina, while Smith, unable to offer Marcus Smith's versatility, was restricted to a win over Fiji and the fringes of the matchday 23.

""It is hard to take,"" Smith told BBC Radio Northampton's Saints Show in December.

Just over three months after he suffered a devastating ankle injury, linebacker Fred Warner returned to practice on Tuesday. And, shockingly, he is not ruling out availability for Saturday's divisional round game against the Seattle Seahawks.

Such a speedy recovery is a remarkable feat for Warner, who was initially deemed out for the season when he broke and dislocated his ankle in Week 6 against the Bucs. Warner underwent surgery after teammate Ji'Ayir Brown rolled up on his leg and twisted his ankle at an awkward angle.

""We're taking it day by day,"" Warner said Wednesday when asked if he anticipated playing this weekend. ""I think they said last week they weren't going to open my [practice] window, and then my window is now open. So we're just taking it day by day.""

Warner was part of the wave of injuries that devastated the 49ers early in the year. Defensive end Nick Bosa was lost for the season due to a torn ACL he suffered in Week 3, and key contributors including quarterback Brock Purdy and Ricky Pearsall also missed time. Star tight end George Kittle saw his campaign come to a close in the Wild Card round when he tore an Achilles tendon.

Despite the poor injury luck, San Francisco stands just two wins away from the Super Bowl.

If Warner returns to the lineup this weekend, he would bolster a defense that seems to be rounding back into prime form. The 49ers surrendered a modest 19 points to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Wild Card round and gave up just 13 points to the Seahawks in the season finale. But things have not always been so bright in Warner's absence.

""I feel amazing,"" Warner said. ""Just so grateful, blessed to be back. I think, obviously, when all this happened, I didn't really think about the possibility of returning in-season. But the way things progressed and being able to have this opportunity to be back with my teammates, have a chance at helping them win this week and so on and so forth, that's my only goal moving forward.""

While the injury dashed his chances of securing first-team All-Pro honors for the fourth consecutive year and fifth time in six seasons, Warner has a chance to rewrite an otherwise lost season. He is one of the best linebackers in the NFL and would contribute immense amounts of leadership and playmaking ability to the middle of the defense if he suits up before the postseason run is over.

""Fred's the ultimate energy-giver, so just having him out there is awesome,"" defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said. ""Yesterday was a little bit more tempo down, but today obviously with higher tempo it'll be fun to get him out there, see him running around.""

Warner had not missed a game in his career prior to the injury. If he does not play again this year, he will finish with a career-low 51 tackles, two tackles for loss and three passes defended.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/14/c798649c-072b-4cc6-af16-cd8dbae03793/thumbnail/1200x675/9cb1bc0c99c0f7014af672a2a6783509/gettyimages-2240299559-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 12:02:34.621912

FOXBOROUGH — Patriots star cornerback Christian Gonzalez is on the right track as he navigates through the NFL’s concussion protocol.

Despite suffering a concussion during last Sunday’s victory over the Chargers in the wild-card round of the playoffs, the defensive back was back on the practice field Wednesday as the Patriots prepared for Sunday’s divisional-round bout against the Texans at Gillette Stadium.

According to New England’s injury report, Gonzalez was a limited participant during Wednesday’s practice, meaning that he’s officially reached Stage 4 of the league’s five-step “return to participation” protocol.

The final step is “full football activity,” meaning that Gonzalez still has a few more practices to be cleared for full contact and get the green light to play on Sunday against Houston.

A healthy Gonzalez would be a welcome sight for a Patriots defense that dominated earlier this week against the Chargers. According to Next Gen Stats, Gonzalez did not allow any catches on five targets within 26 coverage snaps in that win over Los Angeles.

Speaking on Monday, Mike Vrabel did not lay out an official timeline for Gonzalez’s availability.

“Gonzo continues to play at a high level,” Vrabel said. “Those are the expectations that he has for himself and that we have for him, and yeah, I would say that he would be in the protocol. How long that lasts, I don’t know, but when you don’t return to the game, when they won’t let you go back in the game, that would put him in the protocol.

“So, wherever that goes, that goes, but we appreciate what he’s done and his willingness to line up different places. It’s not quite as easy as — we’ve been through this, but different coverages, locations, motions, and things like that. So, he’s handled that all really well. Hopefully, we’ll get him back.”

If cleared for Sunday, Gonzalez would likely be matched up against Houston’s top wide receiver, be it Nico Collins (whose status could be in doubt after suffering a concussion on Monday vs. Pittsburgh), Christian Kirk, or rookies Jayden Higgins or Jaylin Noel.

In his third season in the NFL, Gonzalez has allowed 35 catches on 80 targets for 357 yards, with one touchdown and no interceptions. He has recorded 69 tackles, 10 pass breakups, and one tackle for loss.",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Chargers_Patriots_Football_82244-69681475d481c-768x432.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 10:03:10.273369

New England Patriots: Pass protection Like the 49ers and Bears, the Patriots’ defense does not create a ton of pressure on defense.
Late in the season, New England discovered their run game.","Buffalo Bills: Run defense

Defending the run has long been a sore spot for the Bills – they finished the season 25th in defensive rush success rate. Inside, they lack mass, and are too easily pushed around by teams committed to a smashmouth approach. Outside, they struggle with discipline and technique. Against Jacksonville last weekend, both fell apart. The Jaguars rushed for 154 yards, with 119 of those yards coming on outside runs. It was the Jags’ highest total on outside runs this season. This weekend, against a Broncos offense that is happy to punch anyone in the mouth, that could put the Bills in a lot of trouble.

But Sean McDermott is a defensive mastermind. And his answer to the run game woes has been, effectively, to give up. McDermott has stopped trying to load the box or reinforce the front. He is happy, it seems, to concede steady yards on the ground if the Bills do not cough up an explosive run (10-plus yards). And by not adding extra bodies to the box, he’s been able to maintain schematic flexibility in the secondary. McDermott has now centered his defense around disguises on the back-end secondary, betting that, eventually, opposing offenses will want to throw the ball even on run-obvious downs. Blurring the coverage, without superstar talent, is the best way for a coach to induce mistakes.

McDermott put on a clinic against the Jaguars, baiting Trevor Lawrence into errant throws that forced Jacksonville off the field. Sticking with that plan moving forward is the Bills’ best way out of the mess.

Chicago Bears: Creating pressure

The Bears are living a charmed life on offense. They have a water-tight scheme. They hammer people with the run. And with Caleb Williams, they have a quarterback capable of creating something out of nothing.

Defensively, however, they are more limited. They have lived on turnovers this season, leading the league in takeaways. In the playoffs, that doesn’t cut it. You’re facing the best of the best – and they’re the best precisely because they don’t turn the ball over. All season long, Chicago have worked around their lack of a pass rush. They finished last in the league in the regular season in pressure rate with a four-man rush (a necessity in the playoffs) and in time to pressure from those four-man looks. Defensive coordinator Dennis Allen, a true warlock of a coach, has counteracted that by going hog-wild with blitzes. He has pressured creatively and relentlessly. But coaching can only cover up so much. Even the Bears’ blitz package has been ineffective, generating pressure at the lowest rate among the remaining playoff field.

Some coaches blitz selectively, and that’s key in the playoffs when the best quarterbacks can pick apart defenses that send extra rushers. No quarterback has been as potent against the blitz this year as the Rams Matthew Stafford, who the Bears faces this weekend. Allen hasn’t been able to be selective. He needs to fire extra bodies into the line of scrimmage to make the quarterback uncomfortable. Against the Rams, he’ll likely roll the dice again, hoping that enough pressure gets home that Stafford panics or is moved off his spot, where he is less effective. From there, the Bears will have a chance to snag the turnovers that have kept their head above water all season. It will be a gamble, but it’s Allen’s only path forward.

Denver Broncos: Bo Nix

Nix is the great unanswered question of the playoffs. Is he a needle mover at quarterback? Or is he surviving in a solid scheme, supported by an outstanding defense?

Everything else is in place for the Broncos. They have the best offensive line in the postseason, the top pass-rush and a future Hall of Fame coach. They also have enough firepower at wide receiver to go toe-to-toe with anyone in the AFC, from the reliable Courtland Sutton to the explosive threats of Troy Franklin, Pat Bryant and Marvin Mims. Even with that cast, at some point Nix will need to make big throws on third-and-long.

Nix has already debunked many ideas about his game. He isn’t a game manager; he takes risks down the field. He isn’t a point guard; he can scramble around and extend plays. According to PFF, he ranked behind only Stafford and Dak Prescott in big-time throws this season. Where Nix has struggled is taking the easy openings and moving on with the game. But he has been able to offset some poor decision-making by avoiding sacks and turnovers. The Broncos won’t ask him to be anything else during the playoffs. And if he can hit those difficult third-and-longs, he could put together the kind of playoff hot streak we’ve seen from Joe Flacco and Nick Foles.

Houston Texans: Passing game

The Texans’ performance against the Steelers on Monday was an outlier. They were able to run the ball and sustain a long drive. For much of the season, they’ve been reliant on a brittle passing game and the odd explosive play to launch them down the field. Even when in scoring position, their performance in the redzone has been brutal.

It was Houston’s defense that kept them alive against Pittsburgh. Without a dominant performance, it would have been a game characterized by CJ Stroud’s unusual mid-game meltdown. The Texans cannot afford a repeat performance from their quarterback. Given the lack of talent along the offensive line, they’re unlikely to repeat their success on the ground. It will need to be Stroud who puts them over the top. He has the talent – and he’s done it in the postseason before. The problem, however, is that the passing game has been inconsistent. The Texans have to work hard for their yards. There are few easy buckets. It’s a system reliant on receivers making tough, contested catches or Stroud creating out of structure. That’s a thin tightrope to walk, especially when the team’s No 1 receiver, Nico Collins, is out with a concussion.

Los Angeles Rams: Special teams

The Rams having a punt blocked against the Panthers in the opening round of the playoffs was no anomaly. They’ve had a special teams blunder in three of their five losses this season.

It’s not just a season-long issue, either. It’s institutional. Over the last five years, the Rams rank 32nd in special teams EPA, and there is a chasm between the Rams and the second-worst team over that spell. In successive postseasons, they’ve flirted with disaster, only to be bailed out by their offense and defense. This year’s errors led Sean McVay to a first: firing a coach during the season. But the change in coordinator hasn’t had the desired effect. The Rams have become more effective at limiting kick returns, which has helped their starting field position on defense. But they remain just as prone to bone-headed lapses when they’re kicking the ball themselves.

As they move into the final eight, there is no margin for error. The Rams have all the ingredients of a championship team: they can win in any way on offense, their defense creates havoc in the pocket and they have the quarterback. But they have ignored the third phase of the game for too long. So far, they’ve been able to outrun it. But if they fall apart between now and the Super Bowl, it will probably come down to another untimely kicking mistake.

New England Patriots: Pass protection

Like the 49ers and Bears, the Patriots’ defense does not create a ton of pressure on defense. But they do have a pair of one-on-one winners – Milton Williams and Harold Landry – who could flip a game on their own. The concern is with their own protection.

Late in the season, New England discovered their run game. After struggling for much of the year to move the ball on the ground, the Patriots have a 46% rushing success rate since week 12. That’s helped support a bombs away passing attack that has been the bedrock of the league’s leading offense. But even with the return of first-round left tackle Will Campbell, they allow too much pressure on quarterback Drake Maye. They finished the regular season with a 38.7% pressure rate conceded, which puts them 28th in the league. And the Patriots don’t just concede pressure; they give it up quickly and often unblocked. It makes what Maye has done this season more of a minor miracle.

Maye, for all his brilliance, is prone to taking drive-killing sacks. But against the Texans this weekend, the Pats line could be in big trouble. They struggle with power-based pass-rushers, and Houston have the best duo in the league: Will Anderson and Danielle Hunter. Squeak past the Texans, and the Broncos could be on deck, a team who pressure and sack quarterbacks at the highest rate in the league.

The Patriots need to be able to run the ball to mitigate the risk, and then hope Maye can deliver some flashes of brilliance under duress.

San Francisco 49ers: Pass rush

Robert Saleh deserves credit for dragging the Niners’ defense this far. He has been able to keep a no-name defense competitive throughout the year, despite a battery of injuries and a lack of a pass-rush.

Against the Eagles on Sunday, Saleh loaded the box to stop the run and dared Jalen Hurts and Philly to throw. Against a high-school caliber offense, it was effective. Against tougher opposition, though, it will be tough to make up for.

Saleh, for all his brilliance, runs a fairly simple scheme. He doesn’t disguise coverages. The Niners led the league this season in their use of zone coverage, and those coverages fall into just three buckets. He’s not a blitzer, either, relying on four players to detonate the pocket and attack opposing quarterbacks. It’s difficult to navigate through the playoffs with such a static, predictable scheme without unrelenting pressure. Across the season, the Niners finished with a 22% pressure rate with a four-man pass-rush, 31st in the league and almost half the typical threshold for Super Bowl winners. Against the Eagles’ offense, with all its faults, that figure fell to 11%. That won’t cut it against the Rams, Seahawks or whoever comes out of the AFC, unless Saleh has a late-season curveball he can throw.

Seattle Seahawks: Sam Darnold

Darnold put together a magical first half of the season. He was a front-runner for MVP, driving the ball to all areas of the field, creating plays with his legs and adding newfound refinement to his game. He was hitting difficult, tight-window throws deep down the field at a historic clip. But much of that has dried up in the second half of the year. As Seattle’s defense has risen to match the league’s best and the team’s run-game has come alive, Darnold’s game has soured – at least by his early-season standards.

Since Week 11, Darnold ranks 22nd in the league among eligible starters in the RBSDM composite, which measures the value of a play and how much the quarterback can be deemed responsible for the value. That’s the lowest of any remaining quarterback in the playoffs. His turnovers are up, and the deep ball has withered.

The rest of Seattle’s roster is good enough to cover up for Darnold. Facing the Niners in the divisional round could also prove to be a get-right game, given San Francisco’s defensive frailties. But Darnold has never been to the final eight before, and the Seahawks offense isn’t playing with great rhythm. No single player serves as a bigger pivot point of the postseason. If Darnold limits turnovers, the Seahawks are the front-runners. If he can tap back into his early-season form, they will be the runaway favorites. But if he has a repeat performance of last season’s playoff outing for Minnesota, the Seahawks will be heading home early.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a4b40d9d21ab5933de69c9b01deffdff3c1596a/266_0_2645_2117/master/2645.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8e6dfd7962e6489b745fb332dde50d21",N,,2026-01-15 11:04:45.935300

Tyson made a name for himself during the 2024 season with 75 receptions for 1,101 yards and 10 touchdowns to help the Sun Devils reach the Big 12 Championship and College Football Playoff before missing the postseason due to a collarbone injury.

Pro Football Focus

No. 6 overall, Cleveland Browns

The Browns have the second-worst team receiving grade in the NFL this season and didn’t have a single wide receiver place higher than 100th in PFF grade. Tyson would immediately become the top weapon for whoever’s playing quarterback for Cleveland and has an 89.5 PFF receiving grade over the last two seasons.

CBS Sports

No. 24 overall, Cleveland Browns

Tyson is an explosive receiver with the size, speed and catch radius to win at all three levels. A smooth hands-catcher, he consistently makes contested and high-point grabs look effortless while creating surprising separation at the top of his routes for his size. Tyson can hit top-end speed in just a few steps and shows the type of short-area quickness reserved for smaller, shiftier WRs. He’s also an asset in the screen game, making him a dynamic threat both outside and from the slot.

The Athletic

No. 7 overall, Washington Commanders

When healthy, Tyson is the most complete receiver in this class. The only holes in his game are on his career injury report. He blocks, adjusts to poor throws, runs crisp routes and wins in the air. He’s everything Jayden Daniels needs to take the next step in his development.

Bleacher Report

No. 11 overall, Miami Dolphins

The Miami Dolphins offense underwent a massive evolution since Mike McDaniel became the head coach, but it still needs another significant threat at wide receiver.

…

Whoever takes over will need another weapon on the outside to complement Jaylen Waddle, with Tyreek Hill likely on his way out as well. Jordyn Tyson adds a different dynamic.

ESPN

No. 6 overall, Cleveland Browns

Unless they want to package their two-first round picks to move up, the Browns won’t be able to pick a quarterback. But they do need pass catchers to join breakout rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. and veteran wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. Tyson is a creative route runner who can make catches outside the strike zone with his strong hands at the catch point. He’s also capable of making big plays after the catch.

Cross was downgraded to a limited participant on Seattle’s practice report for Wednesday, listed with both the hamstring and knee injuries. On Tuesday, he was listed as a full participant with just the hamstring injury.

The future is bright, but Seahawks need to capitalize now

Cross’ knee injury calls into question his status for Saturday night’s NFC Divisional Round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. Prior to Wednesday’s practice report, he appeared on track to make his first start since Week 15.

If Cross’ availability is in question, that could be a major problem for Seattle. Backup offensive tackle Josh Jones, who started the past three games at left tackle in place of Cross, hasn’t practiced this week due to a knee injury.

Meanwhile, cornerback Riq Woolen (oblique) was limited for a second straight day and linebacker Ernest Jones IV (illness) sat out practice Wednesday.

On a more positive note, five-time Pro Bowl defensive end Demarcus Lawrence (Achilles) was upgraded to a full participant on Wednesday after being limited on Tuesday. Head coach Mike Macdonald said earlier Wednesday afternoon that he expects Lawrence to play on Saturday night.

Safety Coby Bryant (knee) and rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo (knee), who are both returning from injuries, were full participants for a second straight day.

In addition, backup linebacker Tyrice Knight (shoulder) was upgraded to a limited participant on Wednesday. Key special teams player Chazz Surratt (ankle), who spent the past six weeks on injured reserve, was upgraded to a full participant.

Veteran left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) was upgraded to a full participant on Wednesday after being listed as limited on Tuesday. The 12-time Pro Bowler missed the 49ers’ 13-3 loss to Seattle in Week 18 before returning for San Francisco’s wild-card round win over the Philadelphia Eagles this past Sunday.

""Feeling great man,"" Dotson said Wednesday.
""It's one of those things that's day-by-day, but it's feeling great every day.
His physicality, his ability to go out there and play is great, but also just the energy he brings.
""Even the last game really, it was like, it hurt me to not be out there with my guys,"" Dotson said.","WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. – Rams offensive lineman Kevin Dotson was estimated as a limited participant in Wednesday's practice, marking his first step toward a possible, but anticipated, return from his ankle injury this Sunday against the Bears in the divisional round of the playoffs.

""Feeling great man,"" Dotson said Wednesday. ""It's one of those things that's day-by-day, but it's feeling great every day. It's feeling way, way better compared to what it was at the beginning, so I'm ready to try it out at least.""

Given Los Angeles only conducted a walkthrough Wednesday afternoon, head coach Sean McVay said Thursday's practice will give the team a real gauge of how Dotson's ankle is feeling, ""but he's got a good look in his eye"" and that ""his intentions are to be able to go play and go do his thing"" on Sunday.

""We take it day-to-day, and we have a lot of tests that we have to go through first before we can truly assess it,"" Dotson said.

Dotson has been sidelined by that ankle injury since Week 17, sustaining it the prior week in the Rams' Thursday Night Football loss to the Seahawks in Seattle. Dotson said he felt like he was initially hurt from getting run into, and wasn't aware he had been stepped on by Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall until two days later. Hall's actions drew a one-game suspension without pay from the NFL.

""Because I gave him the benefit of the doubt,"" Dotson said. ""Because my teammates were like – I'm thinking he accidentally stepped on me, and I'm not going to make nothing out of it. And then I'd seen after the play, my dawg (center) Coleman (Shelton) fought for me, pushed for me, then he told me like what really happened and stuff like that. So I was like, okay, and if I would have knew that, I probably would have stood up. I didn't know somebody stepped on me and did all that until I had seen the film and stuff. But I would've knew that. ... I'm past it, I'm not going to hold nothing against him until I can see him (and) get my get-back. Not gonna step on nobody (though), I'll get it between the plays. But I'm fine, I'm fine.""

If the rest of the week goes according to plan and brings McVay's optimism to fruition, Dotson's return would give back to the Rams offensive line the guard with the third-highest run blocking grade in the 2025 regular season (89.3), according to Pro Football Focus. His 86.4 offensive grade also ranked third overall among qualified guards by PFF.

""I mean, he's a mountain of a man,"" quarterback Matthew Stafford said. ""He's a beast. When he was playing this year, I thought he was one of the best guards, if not the best guard in the league. So if we can get him back, obviously that would be a huge boost. His physicality, his ability to go out there and play is great, but also just the energy he brings. I know if you guys see him celebrating sometimes when we do good stuff. So he's a great guy to have out there and be around. But if not, I thought (Justin) Dedich played really well last week, and we'll roll with him again.""

Dotson will do everything in his power to be on the field Sunday.

""Even the last game really, it was like, it hurt me to not be out there with my guys,"" Dotson said. ""Even just to get our get back, I want to be there for that, and couldn't be there for it. So hopefully I can be here for this game, and I want to be able to make an impact.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/rams/yhbn1qwagauhdjn6bh5t,N,,2026-01-15 02:58:50.059363

(WKRC, Provided, Covington PD)

The crash happened around 3 a.m. on November 15 in the 400 block of Scott Street in Covington. Video from a neighborhood security camera that Covington police provided to Local 12 News shows a vehicle running a red light at an intersection and slamming into a parked car. The impact caused a black Jeep to flip over, landing on its roof just out of the camera’s frame.

Just days after serving a five-day jail sentence for a reckless driving incident, Local 12 has uncovered another vehicle crash involving Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt — one that occurred during the NFL season, the day before he suffered a season-ending injury. (Covington PD)

Police records show the Jeep involved in the crash is registered to Taylor-Britt.

The following day, November 16, Taylor-Britt played in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, during which he suffered an injury that ended his season.

According to the official crash report, Taylor-Britt is listed as the backseat passenger. Covington police say no one was arrested or charged in connection with the crash.

However, body camera video obtained by Local 12 shows confusion at the scene, with officers and those involved going back and forth over who was actually behind the wheel. Police say Taylor-Britt and others left the scene before officers could determine responsibility.

The black Jeep had crossed over the Roebling Bridge and into Kentucky moments before it slammed into a red Chevy Cruze parked on Scott Street.

The first officers at the scene encountered two vehicles badly mangled after the collision, but no one was inside or around them. One officer can be heard on body camera saying, “No one is in there, no one is in there they all fled, I guess.”

A short time later, a man walks up to officers and identifies himself as Jafabian Booker, saying he is Cam Taylor-Britt’s brother. During an exchange captured on police body camera, Booker tells an officer the vehicle belongs to Taylor-Britt and claims a woman was driving at the time of the crash.

“This is my brother’s car,” Booker says in the video. When an officer asks where Taylor-Britt is, Booker responds, “He wasn’t in here. I had a female in here. She was drunk driving and this happened.” When the officer asks where she went, Booker replies, “She ran off.”

Officers walk around looking at the aftermath, and body camera video captures their remarks.

“I smell weed reeks of weed.” “Girl supposed to be 5’4 driving the car with the seat all the way back — ain’t no way. Football player was driving, yeah he was driving.”

Police tracked Taylor-Britt to his home, where officers found him outside, mid-conversation on his phone. This is his exchange with an officer.

“It is what it is.” Taylor-Britt then offers to go back to the scene. “I can go back there, but there ain’t nothing to it. I wasn’t driving.”

The officer asks, “Who was driving?”

Taylor-Britt says, “He’s there. He’s there, he’s there right now.”

The officer responds, “No one was there. What was the name of the guy that was driving?”

Taylor-Britt says, “Jafabian (Booker).”

Covington police then redact the body camera footage, allowing only the audio to be heard. The exchange stretches on for nearly 20 minutes, involving Taylor-Britt, officers at the scene, and his brother, Jafabian Booker, who is on the phone.

OFFICER – Sir, were you the one who was driving the car?

BOOKER – No, sir. No, sir. I already gave the description to the other officer of the woman that it was. I was letting her drive.

TAYLOR-BRITT – So Fabian

BOOKER – Yeah.

TAYLOR-BRITT – Keep it gangster, brother, ’cause now it sounds like we got a bunch of what do you call it going on.

Around one minute later, one officer tells another, “Jafabian is saying he’s driving now.”

The police report states that Jafabian Booker initially denied driving but later admitted he was behind the wheel. The report lists the date and time as 11/15 at 3:21 a.m.

In another exchange that was also audio-only, an officer is heard asking Taylor-Britt about his injuries. In the video, his white shirt appears torn at the left shoulder, with what looks like blood visible.

OFFICER – You hurt or anything, man? You look like you got a little blood on you.

TAYLOR-BRITT – No, nah. I’m good.

OFFICER – You aren’t hurt?

TAYLOR-BRITT – Nah, I’m good. I’m really pissed off.

The next day, November 16, Cam Taylor-Britt took the field against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He suffered a foot injury during the game that ended his season.

On January 6, Taylor-Britt appeared in court using crutches while still recovering from that injury and faced a Hamilton County judge.

The 26-year-old pleaded guilty to reckless driving and driving with a restricted license. Cincinnati police cited him twice in 2025 — once in June and again in September.

In court, Taylor-Britt’s attorney told the judge he has no intention of driving anytime soon and said he has relied on others for transportation for several months.

A police officer described the reckless driving incident in detail: “There’s lots of traffic. Lots of pedestrians. Mr. Britt went over the yellow lines, did a burnout, and drove on the wrong side of the road at a high rate of speed up Joe Nuxhall Way.”

Taylor-Britt apologized to the court, acknowledging the seriousness of his actions.

“I just want to apologize for my actions. I plan already to knock out those things that got me into this place, because it is not me, and I don’t want to be here,” Taylor-Britt said.

Judge Bernie Bouchard questioned Taylor-Britt about the danger posed by his actions.

“You’re putting yourself and everybody else in danger on the street. Why?” the judge asked. “No reason at all,” Britt replied.

He was then taken to the Hamilton County Jail to serve his five-day sentence.

One of the charges he just went to jail for was driving under a suspended license. When Covington police asked to see a license after this November accident, Taylor-Britt said he would have to talk to his attorney because at the time he did not have one.

When asked why so much of the body camera video was redacted, Captain Justin Bradbury said, “The entire screen was blacked out on those videos because they were recorded at Mr. Taylor-Britt’s home address. Given his prominence, we felt it necessary to redact the video of the interaction. No matter where the officers turned their camera, it either picked up his numerical address on the building or showed the surrounding area, making it easy for his address to be identified. This was done solely to protect Mr. Taylor-Britt’s privacy.”

Captain Bradbury added, “This case was not turned over to any prosecutor’s office because no one committed a crime.”

Local 12 also reached out to Taylor-Britt’s attorney, Joseph Tekulve, for comment and did not receive a response.",https://local12.com/resources/media2/16x9/830/1320/8x0/90/7cd8e5dd-daee-4cde-9af8-2298c8264c3e-GMCCAMTAYLORBRITTcrash.jpg,N,,2026-01-15 02:59:03.751274
