As the Patriots’ head coach announced during a press conference at Gillette Stadium, running back TreVeyon Henderson, wide receiver Kayshon Boutte and left guard Jared Wilson are all in concussion protocol.

Henderson, 23, left Sunday’s game in the second quarter after he fell over backwards to end a short run. He was checked out on the field by members of the Patriots’ medical staff as well as Vrabel himself, and after a brief stint in. the blue medical tent left the field for the locker room. Originally announced as questionable to return, he was ruled out for the remainder of the contest at the. half.

Boutte, 23, came down hard on a near-reception in the fourth quarter. The third-year receiver, who should have drawn a pass interference flag on the play, tried to haul in a Drake Maye deep pass with cornerback Marlon Humphrey draped all over him. While he did get his hands on it, he failed to compete the catch and in the process of doing so hit his head on the turf. He too was unable to finish the game.

Wilson, 22, played all 74 offensive snaps against Baltimore at his usual spot at left guard and did not showcase any concussion symptoms during the game. Just last week versus the Buffalo Bills, the rookie returned from an ankle injury that had kept him out since early in Week 12 against Cincinnati.

With Lamar Jackson having suffered a variety of injuries this season, Sports Illustrated’s Conor Orr said the Ravens need to take a big-picture view of their quarterback situation.

Orr contended that they should draft a quarterback to back up Jackson and give the organization some flexibility.

""No one is saying that Jackson needs to go, but the sensible among us are saying that Jackson needs a safety net that can one day grow into his replacement on a structured rookie contract,"" Orr wrote.

Orr believes the 2026 draft is the right time to do it.

""Baltimore would have the 14th pick based on current standings, in a quarterback class that serves as the preamble to a much more anticipated 2027 group, which could mean a shorter line between the Ravens and a promising option at the position,"" Orr wrote. ""If Jackson is healthy next season, the Ravens are going to almost certainly be boxed out from taking a top-tier quarterback in the following draft.""

Jackson, who turns 29 in two weeks, missed three games this season with a hamstring injury. He also missed at least one practice over the past seven weeks, in part because of knee, ankle, and toe injuries.

Jackson suffered a painful back contusion in Sunday's loss to the New England Patriots and was not able to participate in Tuesday’s walk-through practice ahead of this Saturday night's must-win game against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.

Injuries limited Jackson to 12 games in both 2021 and 2022, but he did not miss a single game due to injury in 2023 or 2024.

""If you remove illness and rest with a playoff spot already clinched, Jackson has appeared on an NFL injury report 17 times,"" Orr wrote. ""Jackson also has only about 800 fewer carries than Saquon Barkley, who was drafted the same year (1,077 to 1,807). Many of those are kneeldowns in victory formation, but you can add in that Jackson has been sacked 225 times in his career and hit in the pocket 178 times. I have zero —zero —doubt that Jackson's arm talent can help him translate seamlessly into a different phase of his career once his outlier athleticism winnows to the point where it is no longer an advantage. But Baltimore does not know what that looks like yet.

""When taking all of this into consideration, adding in that Jackson's mega-extension will again need to be reworked, the solution seems abundantly clear to me: The Ravens do not need to trade Jackson. They don't need to fire John Harbaugh. But they do need to make 2026 their 'Jordan Love' year and draft a worthy successor to Jackson, which would buttress the Ravens against the kind of collapse we saw this season, give the team a position of strength at the negotiating table and facilitate a situation like Green Bay enjoyed with late-Packer Aaron Rodgers, who won back-to-back MVP awards, in part, after submitting to an offense that more effectively balanced his skill set with a sensible run game.""

Why the Ravens Can Bounce Back Next Season

ESPN’s Ben Solak identified the factors that have contributed to the Ravens being 7-8 and on the brink of elimination from the playoffs. Injuries, an inconsistent offensive line, and a lack of pass rush were among them.

There's no denying it's been a disappointing and frustrating season, but Solak believes the Ravens can bounce back in 2026. He based his opinion in part on what he saw from the Ravens on both sides of the ball in the Patriots game.

""If defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike can come back healthy next season, the Ravens have most of their defensive core intact and under contract – they just need an edge rusher (or two, or three),"" Solak wrote. ""So there's reason to expect the defense to continue excelling next season and for the offense to immediately elevate when Jackson returns to health. You could see that through the cracks in the first half against the Patriots. The defense got stops against one of the league's best offenses.

""Jackson looked spry, and the passing game finally looked explosive again. Running back Derrick Henry had one of his best games of the season, posting a 66.7% success rate on the ground and the fastest average speed (13.81 mph) on rushes in a game this season, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Had the Ravens finished the job, it would have been a statement win for a team clawing its way back into postseason relevance. Instead, Jackson went down with another injury. Tyler Huntley stepped in admirably, but with Henry sidelined (rather peculiarly) for a potential game-salting drive, the Ravens surrendered their 11-point lead and added another notch on the battered post of games they should have won but oddly lost.

""Had Jackson been healthy, it likely would have ended differently. True of the game Sunday night. True of the season, too.""

Zay Flowers' Second Pro Bowl Nod Significantly Increases His Fifth-Year Option Salary

After becoming the Ravens' first Pro Bowl wide receiver last year, Zay Flowers received his second nod this season.

By making the Pro Bowl again, Flowers' fifth-year option salary rose from $24.4 million to $28 million, per Spotrac.

The Baltimore Banner’s Jonas Shaffer looked at what the development could mean for Flowers' future with the organization.

""Only 12 wide receivers have deals worth more than $28 million annually, but the market at the position moves quickly,"" Shaffer wrote. ""In two years, $28 million for a player of Flowers' caliber could be seen as a bargain. … Even if the Ravens don't pick up Flowers' fifth-year option — teams have a May 1 deadline to decide on their 2023 first-round picks — they could still have a future together. Flowers will be eligible for an extension this offseason.

""The Ravens didn't wait long to secure Kyle Hamilton's future last August, making him the NFL's highest-paid safety after just three seasons in Baltimore. Flowers isn't quite the transcendent talent that Hamilton is. But he ranked 14th among all receivers with at least 80 targets last season in yards per route run (2.3), according to Pro Football Focus, and he ranks seventh this year (2.4), ahead of stars like the Cincinnati Bengals' Ja'Marr Chase and Houston Texans' Nico Collins.""

Ronnie Stanley Named One of Biggest Pro Bowl Snubs

The Ravens had six Pro Bowlers, tied with the Denver Broncos, Seattle Seahawks, and San Francisco 49ers for the most in the league. Baltimore also had three alternates.

One player who didn't make it but probably should have is left tackle Ronnie Stanley. ESPN’s Seth Walder named Stanley one of the biggest Pro Bowl snubs.

Walder made the case for Stanley getting the nod over the Los Angeles Chargers' Joe Alt, who made the roster as the third offensive tackle.

""Don't get me wrong, I love Joe Alt,"" Walder wrote. ""He was on pace to be Protector of the Year if he had stayed healthy. But he played only six games, which is in no way enough to make a Pro Bowl. I'd be open to multiple tackles at this spot, but Stanley ranks fifth in pass block win rate and 13th in run block win rate. Metrics-wise, he looks like the most deserving next man up in the AFC after Dion Dawkins and Garett Bolles.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/ravens/pz90lztfervdgeydlr8v,N,,2025-12-24 12:05:45.535425

“I think that we’ll figure out where things are later in the week,” Vrabel said of the slew of injuries.
But one thing is clear: The Patriots have a lengthy injury list heading into the final two weeks of the regular season.","FOXBORO, Mass. — Two days after clinching a playoff berth with a thrilling win Sunday night in Baltimore, coach Mike Vrabel gathered his New England Patriots for an earlier-than-usual session on Tuesday. Before he and his staff took to game-planning for next week, Vrabel wanted to highlight something for the whole team to see.

Vrabel showed the squad a few plays from the end of their win over the Ravens, when Mack Hollins and Kyle Williams were bouncing between three wide receiver positions because of injuries to other players. At one point, Vrabel said, most of the players didn’t realize they had a new right tackle (Thayer Munford), which meant a new jumbo tight end (Ben Brown), which jumbled personnel groupings and formations and caused Williams to change his alignment in the middle of one play.

“So, that’s how quickly things happen,” Vrabel said. “Give all the credit to the players — and the assistant coaches for having them ready and being able to help us win.”

His point held in the bigger picture, too. As the Patriots enter Week 17 with a banged-up roster — nine players suffered injuries Sunday night — there are probably going to be guys who are asked to do a little bit more. Maybe play out of position. Maybe just play more than usual.

Whatever the case, New England has a bunch of injuries heading into a two-game stretch where it’s looking to seal a division title. “Unfinished business” is how Vrabel described the mindset, even after clinching a spot in the postseason.

Fortunately for the Patriots, they’re headed to New York this weekend for the NFL’s favorite get-right game, a Sunday matchup against the Jets. Even with the injuries that have piled up, the Pats should be able to take care of business against a team with Brady Cook at quarterback that got blown out by the New Orleans Saints last weekend. New England is a 13.5-point road favorite, per Bet MGM, even despite the injuries.

Still, with the playoffs on the not-too-distant horizon, the lengthy injury report is worth noting.

There’s a chance the Patriots head into Sunday’s game with only four healthy wide receivers, without three of their usual starting offensive linemen, with only one running back who has played meaningful snaps this season and without two regular cornerbacks.

The bad news? The Pats began the week with three players in the concussion protocol: running back TreVeyon Henderson, wide receiver Kayshon Boutte and left guard Jared Wilson. Additionally, run-stuffing defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga suffered a foot injury Sunday that is expected to keep him out of the Jets game, NFL Network reported. Receiver DeMario Douglas suffered a hamstring injury that could keep him out Sunday, as did defensive lineman Joshua Farmer. Right tackle Morgan Moses suffered a knee injury, but he played through it in the second half when Munford, his backup, suffered a knee injury of his own. They could both be limited this weekend. And cornerback Carlton Davis left the game with an apparent injury, though his status for Sunday is unclear.

The good news? Reinforcements are on the way. The Patriots plan to open defensive tackle Milton Williams’ practice window so he can participate on Wednesday. The team’s highest-paid player is then eligible to be activated off injured reserve at any point over the ensuing 21 days, and playing Sunday against the Jets is a possibility. Plus, while less is known about Will Campbell’s status, the rookie left tackle has earned rave reviews from teammates for the way he has stayed engaged through a knee injury. He’s eligible to open his 21-day practice window next week, meaning he could return for Week 18.

Still, it sets up the Patriots for a tough decision. Should they use players who may not be 100 percent healthy in these final two regular-season games to increase their chances of winning the division and chasing the No. 1 seed? Or should they rest them for the postseason, even if it hurts their chances of earning a home game in the playoffs?

“I think that we’ll figure out where things are later in the week,” Vrabel said of the slew of injuries. “Everybody’s been getting treatment. We got back late (from Baltimore). So today will be a good opportunity just to see a little bit of activity, a walk-through. But (we want to) get guys up, moving around. …

“I tell everybody the same thing,” Vrabel continued. “Just be honest with how you’re feeling. Talk to the doctors. Talk to the trainer. We do an evaluation every day. We do a symptom score. So, I think those are the ones that you want to just try to focus on. The guys that have an ankle or … a knee, they’re going to be OK. Sometimes, any of these things that relate to concussions can react differently, and there’s no pre-described amount of time that they’re going to be out.”

Wednesday will be the team’s first full practice of the week. They’ll likely know more about who can play on Thursday morning after it’s clear how the injuries respond to practice.

But one thing is clear: The Patriots have a lengthy injury list heading into the final two weeks of the regular season.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/23152836/USATSI_27869139-scaled-e1766521805383.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-24 04:59:58.554029

**UPDATED AS OF TUESDAY, DECEMBER 23RD AT 5 PM ET**

🏈 AFC East

◆ Buffalo Bills

Josh Allen - QB (foot)

Head coach Sean McDermott labeled Allen day-to-day with a foot injury sustained in Week 16.

Fantasy Impact: Allen picked up the injury in the second quarter and did not miss an offensive snap, indicating he will be out there with no limitations come Sunday. He remains a locked-in QB1 after his worst fantasy outing since his rookie season.

Matt Prater - K (quad)

Prater will not play.

Fantasy Impact: The Bills signed kicker Michael Badgley to kick in Prater’s stead. He is barely on the K1 radar.

◆ Miami Dolphins

Tyreek Hill - WR (knee)

Hill suffered a dislocated knee in the team’s Week 4 win over the Jets. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Hill’s absence likely places additional emphasis on the short-to-intermediate areas of the field, increasing the expected target volume for De’Von Achane, Darren Waller, and Jaylen Waddle.

◆ New England Patriots

TreVeyon Henderson - RB (concussion)

Henderson departed in the second quarter of the team’s Week 16 win over the Ravens with a concussion.

Fantasy Impact: If trends from the league this season remain intact, we tentatively expect Henderson to miss Week 17. Rhamondre Stevenson could be in line for a massive workload against the Jets considering the team is still without Antonio Gibson and Terrell Jennings, demanding legitimate RB1 consideration in a plus matchup.

Kayshon Boutte - WR (concussion)

Boutte sustained a concussion in the team’s Week 16 win over the Ravens.

Fantasy Impact: An absence from Boutte could afford additional opportunities for Mack Hollins and rookie Kyle Williams, the latter of whom has routinely demonstrated big play ability. Neither should be trusted as anything more than a desperation FLEX for fantasy Championships.

Terrell Jennings - RB (concussion)

Jennings will miss the rest of the regular season on injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Jennings is no longer a threat to steal short-yardage carries.

◆ New York Jets

Mason Taylor - TE (neck)

Taylor has been ruled out for Week 16, missing his second consecutive game.

Fantasy Impact: Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell should operate as the clear-cut No. 1 pass catcher.

Tyrod Taylor - QB (groin)

Taylor departed the team’s Week 14 loss to the Dolphins with a groin injury and did not return. Taylor was sidelined on Wednesday and did not play in Week 15. He is competing with quarterback Justin Fields (knee) for the primary backup role.

Fantasy Impact: None.

Justin Fields - QB (knee)

Fields is rehabbing the knee injury while competing for the No. 2 job.

Fantasy Impact: See above.

Garrett Wilson - WR (knee)

Wilson sprained his knee in his return to the active roster in Week 10 and is set to miss “three-to-four weeks.” He was placed on injured reserve and is eligible to return in Week 15. Head coach Aaron Glenn told reporters Monday that he did not have an update on Wilson’s potential return from injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Whelp, Wilson’s return didn’t last long as he is now set to miss another chunk of time with an additional knee injury. The Jets again find themselves bereft of pass-catching talent. Rookie tight end Mason Taylor stands to benefit the most in a fantasy setting, although the Jets continue to be allergic to throwing the football. Head coach Aaron Glenn said last week that he expects Wilson to “return this season.”

Braelon Allen - RB (knee)

Allen suffered a “pretty serious” knee injury on a kickoff return in the second quarter of the team’s Week 4 loss to the Dolphins. He is out indefinitely.

Fantasy Impact: Allen has been a significant contributor in the red zone this season. His absence substantially boosts Breece Hall‘s upside, who is now a locked-in RB1 in Week 5 against the Cowboys. Backup running back Isaiah Davis can be stashed in 12-team leagues as a high-upside contingency option. Hall gained a season-high 155 yards from scrimmage on 18 opportunities in his first game without Allen in Week 5.

Josh Reynolds - WR (hip)

Reynolds was evidently placed on injured reserve in Week 10, after suffering a hip injury during practice in Week 8.

Fantasy Impact: Reynolds’ absence clears the way for new Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to be active on game day.

🏈 AFC North

◆ Baltimore Ravens

Lamar Jackson - QB (back)

Jackson has a “significant contusion” to his back.

Fantasy Impact: Jackson could not finish the team’s Week 16 loss to the Patriots. The Ravens need to win out and get a loss from the Steelers in Week 17 to make the post season, meaning it is likely Jackson plays through the ailment, if at all possible. Fantasy managers will want to monitor his game status on a short week after head coach John Harbaugh labeled him day-to-day. It would be Tyler Huntley under center against the Packers if Jackson can’t go.

Justice Hill - RB (neck)

Hill will not play in Week 13. Head coach John Harbaugh said Monday that Hill could return “in three to four weeks.”

Fantasy Impact: Running back Keaton Mitchell will continue operating as the clear-cut No. 2 in Baltimore.

◆ Cincinnati Bengals

Noah Fant - TE (ankle)

Fant missed Week 16 with an ankle injury.

Fantasy Impact: Fant’s absence could provide additional snaps to Mike Gesicki, although none of the remaining tight ends warrant fantasy consideration with both Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins on the field.

◆ Cleveland Browns

David Njoku - TE (knee)

Njoku aggravated his knee injury in Week 14. He was ruled out for Week 15 and remains sidelined in Week 16.

Fantasy Impact: We expect rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. to continue operating as the team’s No. 1 pass catcher. Start Fannin with confidence after a career game a week ago.

Dylan Sampson - RB (calf)

Sampson was sidelined by the calf injury in Week 15. He has not yet resumed practicing and will miss Week 16.

Fantasy Impact: Fellow rookie RB Quinshon Judkins earned four targets with Sampson out last week, tying his career-high. Judkins totaled minus-four yards on three receptions, though. He is an inefficient receiver.

Quinshon Judkins - RB (ankle, leg)

Judkins suffered a fractured fibula and dislocated ankle in Week 16, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: The Cleveland backfield has been decimated by injury this season, leaving only Trayveon Williams and Raheim Sanders as healthy backs currently on the roster. Neither figures to provide any fantasy utility as the Browns limp their way towards the offseason.

Jerome Ford - RB (shoulder)

The Browns signed running back Trayveon Williams after placing Ford on injured reserve this week.

Fantasy Impact: Williams is unlikely to contribute on game day, now occupying the No. 3 role. We expect No. 2 running back Dylan Sampson (calf/hand) to continue playing through injury.

◆ Pittsburgh Steelers

The Steelers did not experience any fantasy-relevant injuries in their Week 16 win over the Lions, although wide receiver DK Metcalf was suspended for two games following an interaction with a fan.

🏈 AFC South

◆ Houston Texans

Joe Mixon - RB (foot)

Mixon was placed on the Non-Football Injury list ahead of Week 1. He is not expected to play this year.

Fantasy Impact: Veteran Nick Chubb is now in a game script-dependent rushing role, while rookie running back Woody Marks operates as the starter.

◆ Indianapolis Colts

Daniel Jones - QB (Achilles)

Jones played through a fracture in his fibula for two-plus games before suffering a torn Achilles in Week 14. His season is done.

Fantasy Impact: The injury comes at the worst possible time for the sliding Colts, who have dropped from the two-seed to the fringes of playoff contention in three short weeks. Making matters worse, Riley Leonard suffered a knee injury in relief duties against the Jaguars. The Colts signed potential Hall of Fame candidate Philip Rivers, who is set to draw another start in Week 16.

Anthony Richardson - QB (eye)

Richardson suffered a “freak accident” ahead of Week 6 in which an elastic band snapped a piece of metal hit him in the eye, fracturing his orbital bone. He was placed on injured reserve. He was medically cleared to resume practicing on Monday, but he is not a candidate to start and has not yet been activated.

Fantasy Impact: Richardson was medically cleared to practice Monday but the team already named veteran Philip Rivers the starter for Week 16.

◆ Jacksonville Jaguars

Bhayshul Tuten - RB (finger)

Tuten underwent successful surgery on his finger Monday and will miss the remainder of the season.

Fantasy Impact: Tuten’s injury leaves Travis Etienne alone in the backfield, although the team signed journeyman DeeJay Dallas on Tuesday. Etienne carries clear league-winning upside in a likely robust role for the remainder of the season. Rookie running back LeQuint Allen can be stashed.

Travis Hunter - WR/CB (knee)

Hunter was placed on injured reserve with a season-ending LCL tear.

Fantasy Impact: See Thomas’ section above.

◆ Tennessee Titans

Calvin Ridley - WR (hamstring)

Ridley reportedly broke his fibula in Week 11 and is out for the season.

Fantasy Impact: It’s a disappointing end to a disappointing season for the veteran receiver. The Titans are left with no standout fantasy options in his absence.

🏈 AFC West

◆ Denver Broncos

Pat Bryant - WR (concussion)

Bryant sustained a concussion that required hospitalization in Week 16 and is expected to be sidelined through Week 17. He was discharged from the hospital Sunday.

Fantasy Impact: Bryant’s vacated snaps should fall on Lil’Jordan Humphrey, although it is likely to result in an increased emphasis on Courtland Sutton and Troy Franklin through the air.

J.K. Dobbins - RB (foot)

Dobbins was ruled out on Friday before being placed on IR on Saturday. The injury requires surgery, likely ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Rookie RJ Harvey is in line to see a noticeable increase to what has been a modest snap rate, although Tyler Badie remained frustratingly involved. Jaleel McLaughlin also saw increased opportunities on early downs.

◆ Kansas City Chiefs

Rashee Rice - WR (concussion)

Rice “reported concussion symptoms on Monday and entered the league’s protocol,” jeopardizing his availability against the Titans. He did not practice on Wednesday and was ruled out for Week 16 Friday. He remained sidelined through Tuesday on a short week.

Fantasy Impact: Chiefs wide receiver Tyquan Thornton is also in the NFL’s concussion protocol. Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce could handle a sizable workload in Week 17.

Patrick Mahomes - QB (knee)

Mahomes suffered a season-ending ACL tear with an associated LCL tear in the Chiefs’ Week 15 loss to the Chargers. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Mahomes underwent successful surgery Monday to repair both ligaments, thusly starting an estimated nine-month recovery timetable. Gardner Minshew will start for the Chiefs for the remainder of the season after the team was eliminated from postseason contention in Week 15.

◆ Las Vegas Raiders

The Raiders did not experience any significant injuries in their Week 16 loss to the Texans.

◆ Los Angeles Chargers

Kimani Vidal - RB (neck)

Vidal suffered a neck injury in the team’s Week 16 win over the Cowboys.

Fantasy Impact: NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that Vidal avoided a serious injury but is expected to miss time, likely leaving Omarion Hampton and Hassan Haskins to handle the bulk of the work against the Texans. Hampton can be treated as a boom-bust RB2 in a difficult matchup.

Najee Harris - RB (Achilles)

Harris ruptured the Achilles tendon in his left leg during the Chargers’ Week 3 win over the Broncos. His season is done.

Fantasy Impact: Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal are likely to continue splitting backfield work until the former can work his way back into game shape.

🏈 NFC East

◆ Dallas Cowboys

Javonte Williams - RB (neck)

Williams injured his neck early in the Cowboys’ Week 16 game against the Vikings. Although he missed snaps, including opportunities in the red zone, he did manage to play through it. He was limited on Monday.

Fantasy Impact: Williams is a low-end RB1 against the Commanders.

Ryan Flournoy - WR (knee)

Flournoy was unable to finish the team’s Week 16 loss to the Chargers due to a knee injury. He was listed as limited Monday.

Fantasy Impact: Flournoy’s limited listing is a good sign for his potential availability against the Commanders on a short week, although fantasy managers will want to track his status this week closely.

Miles Sanders - RB (ankle/knee)

Sanders was injured in Week 4 and did not play in Week 5. He was ruled out for Week 6 before being placed on injured reserve, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Veteran Javonte Williams continues to operate in a near workhorse role.

◆ New York Giants

Malik Nabers - WR (knee)

Nabers suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 4 win over the Chargers and will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.

Fantasy Impact: The injury could not have come at a worse time for the Giants after they moved to rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart under center. Nabers’ absence will make it difficult to consistently move the football, lowering the upside of all remaining healthy players. Nabers makes for a solid trade target for dynasty managers looking to rebuild this season.

Cam Skattebo - RB (ankle)

Skattebo suffered a gruesome dislocated ankle in the team’s Week 8 loss to the Eagles, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: The backfield in New York should revert to a timeshare headed by veteran Tyrone Tracy in Skattebo’s absence. Devin Singletary remains on hand for change-of-pace duties. Treat Tracy as a low-end RB2 for the remainder of the season.

◆ Philadelphia Eagles

The Eagles emerged from their Week 16 win over the Commanders with a clean bill of health.

◆ Washington Commanders

Marcus Mariota - QB (hand, quad)

Mariota was unable to finish the team’s Week 16 loss to the Eagles with multiple injuries.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Dan Quinn would not rule the veteran backup out for Christmas Day, although he appears to be a true game-time decision. It could be veteran journeyman Josh Johnson against the Cowboys.

Jaylin Lane - WR (ankle)

The team placed Lane on injured reserve, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Minimal. Lane had yet to carve out a significant role on offense.

Jayden Daniels - QB (elbow)

Daniels dislocated the elbow in his left, non-throwing arm in the team’s Week 9 loss to the Seahawks. He was ruled out for the remainder of the season Monday.

Fantasy Impact: Backup quarterback Marcus Mariota will start for the Commanders in the final three weeks of the regular season. He is a borderline QB1/2.

Noah Brown - WR (ribs)

The team placed Brown on injured reserve on Monday, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: None. Brown has not been fantasy-relevant all season.

Zach Ertz - TE (knee)

Ertz suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 14 loss to the Vikings. His season is done.

Fantasy Impact: The hits keep on coming for the Commanders in a lost season. John Bates should step into a significant role for the Commanders down the stretch but likely does not carry enough upside for weekly fantasy consideration.

🏈 NFC North

◆ Chicago Bears

Rome Odunze - WR (foot)

Odunze returned to practice on Wednesday and missing all of Week 14. He was removed from the injury report for Week 15 before missing the game after aggravating the injury in pre-game warmups. He has not yet resumed practicing and was ruled out for Week 16.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Ben Johnson told reporters Monday that “all options are on the table” regarding Odunze’s status moving forward. That does not inspire confidence that he will be available in the coming weeks.

Luther Burden - WR (ankle)

Burden injured his ankle in Week 15 and has been unable to practice since. He was ruled out for Week 16 Thursday.

Fantasy Impact: Bears tight end Colston Loveland, and wide receivers DJ Moore and Olamide Zaccheaus should receive notable target share bumps if Odunze and Burden are both sidelined. Tight end Cole Kmet (knee/ankle) was also limited on Wednesday.

◆ Detroit Lions

Amon-Ra St. Brown - WR (knee)

St. Brown was listed as ‘DNP’ Monday but avoided a serious injury.

Fantasy Impact: Likely none. Head coach Dan Campbell said Tuesday that St. Brown has “a little irritation.” We expect him to be good to go as the Lions fight to remain in the playoff race in the NFC.

Brock Wright - TE (neck)

Wright landed hard on his neck in Week 12. He has been placed on injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Backup tight ends Shane Zylstra (knee) and Ross Dwelley form a fantasy-unfriendly duo, who should only be considered in DFS lineups.

Sam LaPorta - TE (back)

LaPorta was added to the Lions’ injury report with a back injury on Wednesday. After being ruled out for Week 11 on Friday, the Lions placed him on injured reserve on Saturday.

Fantasy Impact: The Lions’ pass-catching corps is deep. Removing LaPorta from it could result in one or more extra targets for WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR Jameson Williams and RB Jahmyr Gibbs.

◆ Green Bay Packers

Jordan Love - QB (concussion)

Love is in the league’s concussion protocol after being removed from Week 16.

Fantasy Impact: Love was listed as limited on Tuesday, which is the same designation backup Malik Willis (shoulder) drew. It’ll be a “wait and see” approach for the quarterback situation in Green Bay as the Packers fight to remain in the playoff picture in the NFC.

Josh Jacobs - RB (knee/ankle)

Jacobs reportedly aggravated his knee injury in the team’s Week 15 loss to the Broncos. His knee also reportedly “stiffened” up in Week 14 against the Bears. Aggravations in consecutive games are concerning. He missed Week 16’s first two practices and drew a questionable tag for Saturday’s game against the Bears.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Matt LaFleur told reporters Monday that Jacobs “would not have practiced” had the team held a regular session. He should continue to see his practice reps managed and could be in line to miss Week 16 against the Bears. No. 2 running back Emanuel Wilson must be rostered.

Tucker Kraft - TE (knee)

Kraft suffered a season-ending torn ACL in the team’s Week 9 loss to the Panthers.

Fantasy Impact: Kraft’s breakout season comes to an end prematurely after the untimely knee injury. Luke Musgrave should be rostered in all formats as he likely enters a featured role for the Packers.

◆ Minnesota Vikings

Aaron Jones - RB (ankle)

Jones continues to play through multiple ailments, although he was listed as a ‘DNP’ on Monday’s estimated practice report.

Fantasy Impact: The Vikings continue to deal with multiple injuries to their backfield. Fantasy managers will want to track his status on a short week closely considering Jordan Mason appears unlikely to play in Week 17.

Jordan Mason - RB (ankle)

Mason is considered a “long shot” to play in Week 17.

Fantasy Impact: The team activated Ty Chandler from injured reserve Tuesday. He could immediately step into meaningful snaps with Aaron Jones also tending to multiple injuries.

Carson Wentz - QB (shoulder)

Wentz will undergo season-ending surgery after playing through a dislocated shoulder and torn labrum.

Fantasy Impact: Second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy is the starter in Minnesota moving forward.

🏈 NFC South

◆ Atlanta Falcons

Michael Penix - QB (knee)

Penix reportedly suffered a knee injury that included a partially torn ACL, a separate sprain and a bone bruise in the team’s Week 11 loss to the Panthers. He will undergo season-ending ACL reconstruction.

Fantasy Impact: That leaves the team in the hands of veteran Kirk Cousins moving forward. Cousins notably completed 21-of-31 passes for only 173 yards with no touchdowns in his only other start this season, which came against an underperforming Dolphins team. The Falcons could be in some trouble the rest of the way.

◆ Carolina Panthers

The Panthers escaped their Week 16 win over the Buccaneers absent any fantasy-relevant injuries.

◆ New Orleans Saints

Devin Neal - RB (hamstring)

Neal departed the team’s Week 15 win over the Panthers with a hamstring injury. On Wednesday, the Saints ruled him out for Week 16 against the Jets.

Fantasy Impact: The Saints promoted running back Evan Hull to the active roster in November. Running back Audric Estime was promoted to the active roster for last week’s game. Neither player ran efficiently, but Estime was surprisingly used effectively via screen passes and checkdowns. Estime could be the starter this week.

Devaughn Vele - WR (shoulder)

Vele could not finish the team’s Week 15 win over the Panthers due to a shoulder injury. On Wednesday, the Saints ruled Vele out for Week 16 against the Jets.

Fantasy Impact: Mason Tipton would be next in line for snaps at wide receiver alongside Chris Olave, should Vele be unable to go in Week 16. Olave became quarterback Tyler Shough‘s go-to receiver after Vele left early in Week 15.

Alvin Kamara - RB (ankle/knee)

Kamara remains sidelined by his ankle injury and PCL sprain. He has neither practiced nor played since Week 12 and was ruled out for Week 15 on Friday. He remains sidelined to begin Week 16 and was ruled out Friday.

Fantasy Impact: See above.

Kendre Miller - RB (ACL)

Miller suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 7 loss to the Bears. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Rookie Devin Neal should step into the primary change-of-pace role for the Saints in Miller’s absence. Lead back Alvin Kamara saw the highest snap rate since Week 2 following Miller’s departure and could be again looking at a workhorse role moving forward.

◆ Tampa Bay Buccaneers

The Buccaneers are now back to full strength following a Week 16 loss to the Panthers.

🏈 NFC West

◆ Arizona Cardinals

Zonovan Knight - RB (ankle)

The Cardinals placed Knight on injured reserve Monday, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Michael Carter and Emari Demercado should split work in the backfield for the rest of the season.

Greg Dortch - WR (chest)

The Cardinals placed Dortch on injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Wide receiver Michael Wilson will continue earning targets voluminously.

Trey Benson - RB (knee)

Benson underwent surgery after injuring his meniscus in Week 4. The Cardinals opened his 21-day practice window in Week 12, but they ultimately decided not to activate him from injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Running back Bam Knight is seemingly the best bet to operate as the Cardinals’ rest-of-season starter.

Kyler Murray - QB (foot)

Murray injured his foot on a fourth-quarter fumble in Week 5. He was placed on injured reserve in Week 10 and will be eligible to return in Week 14 against the Rams, though it could be as the Cardinals’ backup. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Monday that the team will not open his 21-day practice window this week.

Fantasy Impact: Quarterback Jacoby Brissett has finished as a QB1 in his last three games. He remains a viable streamer.

James Conner - RB (ankle)

Conner suffered a season-ending foot injury in Week 3.

Fantasy Impact: See: Trey Benson.

Zay Jones - WR (Achilles)

Jones suffered a torn Achilles in the team’s Week 10 loss to the Seahawks, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Jones filled a situational role for the Cardinals but his absence could provide additional run for veteran slot man Greg Dortch.

◆ Los Angeles Rams

Davante Adams - WR (hamstring)

Adams played through the hamstring strain without suffering a reported re-injury in Week 14. He aggravated the injury in the team’s Week 15 win and was unable to finish the game.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Sean McVay told reporters Monday that Adams would “most likely not play” in Week 17 against the Falcons. Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua referred to wide receiver Konata Mumphield as Adams’ ”apprentice.” Mumphield could warrant boom-bust FLEX consideration, though he has no fantasy floor.

Tyler Higbee - TE (ankle)

Higbee was placed on injured reserve after suffering an ankle injury in the team’s Week 11 win over the Seahawks.

Fantasy Impact: Higbee’s absence for much of the game against the Seahawks simply allowed rookie Terrance Ferguson to step into additional snaps as opposed to forcing the team to move away from their league-leading 13-personnel rates. Colby Parkinson should be viewed as the team’s starter. Davis Allen is capable as well. The Panthers struggle to cover opposing tight ends.

◆ San Francisco 49ers

Ricky Pearsall - WR (ankle, knee)

Pearsall injured both his knee and ankle in the team’s Week 15 win. He did not practice at all this week and appears headed for an absence on Monday Night Football.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters on Monday that “there is concern” about Pearsall’s injuries. Missed time could force Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson into increased run.

Brandon Aiyuk - WR (knee)

Head coach Kyle Shanahan said the team would not open Aiyuk’s 21-day practice window ahead of a Week 11 meeting with the Cardinals. The same was said for Week 12, and now Week 13. Reports then surfaced that Aiyuk and the 49ers are “headed for divorce” after the team voided his 2025 guarantees.

Fantasy Impact: A mostly lost season for Aiyuk appears to be quickly approaching, at least as far as fantasy is concerned.

◆ Seattle Seahawks

Elijah Arroyo - TE (knee)

Arroyo is “out right now” with a knee injury.

Fantasy Impact: The injury allows tight end AJ Barner to assume a full-time role.

Tory Horton - WR (groin, shin)

Horton was added to the injury report Thursday with multiple ailments and did not play in Week 10 against the Cardinals. He was ruled out for Week 11 on Friday and remains sidelined early in Week 12. He was ruled out for Week 12 Friday.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/40a2593/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4299x2418+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff2%2Fc0%2Fad11014f47c9805129f18eebe16e%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D27865152,N,,2025-12-24 01:59:04.899030

After winning the Super Bowl, Williams left the Eagles and then landed a four-year, $104 million deal with the Patriots in the 2025 offseason.
If all goes well, it will be a good thing for the Patriots,” Williams said on Tuesday.","The New England Patriots’ hopes of making a Super Bowl run might have gotten a little better going into Week 17.

On Tuesday, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel stated that star defensive tackle Milton Williams will have his 21-day practice window opened, via team reporter Evan Lazar.

Williams suffered a high ankle sprain in the Week 11 game against the New York Jets and was placed on Injured Reserve after that. He has missed the past four games, and this week was the first week he was eligible to come off IR.

Williams was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the third round of the 2021 NFL Draft and played the first four seasons with the Eagles.

After winning the Super Bowl, Williams left the Eagles and then landed a four-year, $104 million deal with the Patriots in the 2025 offseason.

Williams got off to a strong start, totaling 14 solo tackles with 3.5 sacks in 11 games before suffering the injury.

The Patriots are hopeful Williams can return before the regular season ends, and the standout DT said he just has to see how the injury feels, according to Mike Reiss of ESPN.

“I’m feeling good. Just have to see how it responds. If all goes well, it will be a good thing for the Patriots,” Williams said on Tuesday.

The Patriots face the New York Jets on the road in Week 17 before finishing the regular season against the Miami Dolphins in Foxborough, and having Williams back would be a huge boost to the defense as New England tries to secure the No. 1 seed in the AFC.",https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Vrabel-1.jpeg,N,,2025-12-24 00:58:52.428314

The 49ers, who already have clinched a spot in the NFC playoffs with an 11-4 record, had four offensive stars and two special-teams players selected to the Pro Bowl.

Running back Christian McCaffrey, fullback Kyle Juszczyk, tight end George Kittle and left tackle Trent Williams join special-teamers Luke Gifford and Jon Weeks as Pro Bowl members of the 49ers.

In addition, 49ers return specialist Skyy Moore was named as a Pro Bowl alternate.

Gifford and Weeks signed with the 49ers as free agents this season as key pieces of the team’s overhaul in the kicking game under first-year special teams coordinator Brant Boyer. Gifford has registered 19 special-teams tackles, which is tied for fourth-most in the NFL. He was selected to his first Pro Bowl. Weeks, a 15-year NFL veteran, is the team’s long-snapper. He earned his second career trip to the Pro Bowl.

McCaffrey went over the 1,000-yard mark in rushing in the 49ers’ 48-27 victory over the Indianapolis Colts on Monday night. He earns his fourth Pro Bowl invitation and his third as a member of the 49ers. McCaffrey also has 92 receptions for 849 yards.

Juszczyk earned his 10th consecutive trip to the Pro Bowl and his ninth straight as a member of the 49ers. Jerry Rice (12) and Leo Nomellini (10) are the only players in 49ers history with more Pro Bowls, as Juszczyk pulled into a tie with Ronnie Lott, who was selected to nine Pro Bowls with the 49ers.

Juszczyk’s 10 total Pro Bowls is the most for a fullback in NFL history.

Kittle was selected to his seventh Pro Bowl and his fifth consecutive. Despite missing five games earlier this season with a hamstring injury, Kittle has 52 catches for 599 yards and seven touchdowns.

Williams was selected to his 12th career Pro Bowl and his fifth as a member of the 49ers since arriving in the 2020 offseason in a trade from Washington. Williams becomes the fourth offensive lineman in league history with 12 or more Pro Bowls, joining Bruce Matthews (14), Randall McDaniel (12) and Will Shields (12).

The 2026 Pro Bowl Games will be held during Super Bowl LX week in San Francisco. The event will feature an NFC vs. AFC flag football game.

""He's in the protocol, and he'll practice per the protocol,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Tuesday.
When asked how he finished the game, Willis said: ""The adrenaline's pumping and, you know, we got to get in.
LaFleur and the offensive coaches also have to continue to monitor running back Josh Jacobs' knee injury.
Green Bay could still win the NFC North if it wins its final two games and the Bears (11-4) lose both.","GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Jordan Love took the first steps toward returning from the concussion he sustained in Saturday's loss to the Chicago Bears when he participated in meetings and a walk-through session while Malik Willis downplayed the severity of his shoulder injury.

It made things look a little less dire for the Green Bay Packers quarterbacks Tuesday.

Love remained in the concussion protocol after getting taken out in the first half of Saturday's loss to the Chicago Bears following a helmet hit from defensive end Austin Booker. But he was able to take part in most of what the Packers did during the first day of preparation for Saturday's game against the Baltimore Ravens.

""He's in the protocol, and he'll practice per the protocol,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Tuesday. ""So, he'll be limited.""

Because it was not a full practice, participation levels were estimated. The Packers are expected to hold a standard in-season practice Wednesday.

Love could not speak to reporters because NFL rules prohibit players in the protocol from speaking to the media, but he was seen walking through the locker room Tuesday and chatting with teammates as usual.

""He's good,"" backup quarterback Willis said. ""He's chillin'.""

Willis also was a limited participant Tuesday after he sustained a right shoulder injury on the final play of regulation against the Bears, when Montez Sweat sacked him and landed on top of him. Willis finished the game in overtime. He did not appear to have any trouble throwing in overtime, but he fumbled a snap and turned the ball over to the Bears to set up their game-winning drive. The Packers did not have a third quarterback available against Chicago.

When asked how he finished the game, Willis said: ""The adrenaline's pumping and, you know, we got to get in. We don't have anybody else, so we've got to keep going. It was fun.""

Willis said he would ""assume that I'm going to be ready"" Saturday regardless of whether that's as a starter or backup.

""We've got to see how they progress throughout the course of the week,"" LaFleur said. ""So, by no means are they in the clear.""

LaFleur and the offensive coaches also have to continue to monitor running back Josh Jacobs' knee injury. Jacobs played against the Bears despite being questionable going into the game. He played 28 snaps on offense but lost a fumble in the second half. He also was on the field for the botched onside kick recovery attempt late in the fourth quarter.

Jacobs' left knee has been an issue for more than a month. He missed one game but has played in the past four straight games. With only two games to go and a playoff spot hanging in the balance, the Packers would have to think long and hard about giving Jacobs a week off just to rest even if he felt like he could play.

""I wish we were in a better position to do that,"" LaFleur said. ""If we feel like it's, you know, this is where the collaboration comes in. I think, with myself, with him and our athletic trainers, in terms of what's best for the short term, as well as trying to weigh in the long term.""

In all, the Packers listed 20 players on their injury report Tuesday.

The Packers (9-5-1) could have a playoff spot clinched before Saturday if the Lions lose to the Vikings on Thursday. Green Bay could still win the NFC North if it wins its final two games and the Bears (11-4) lose both.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1223%2Fr1593193_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-24 00:59:08.898428

But some of the Patriots' offseason additions have played a role as well, including rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson.
How long is TreVeyon Henderson out?
Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said today that Henderson has entered concussion protocol following his head injury against Baltimore.
TreVeyon Henderson injury update Henderson suffered a concussion in the second quarter of Sunday night's game during a first-down rush.","The New England Patriots are back at the top of the AFC standings in 2025. A win in prime time over the Baltimore Ravens in Week 16 cements their status as a No. 1 seed contender in the playoffs.

With two weeks to go, it's down to the Patriots, Denver Broncos and Jacksonville Jaguars over who will earn the top seed in the AFC – a sentence few would've expected to read in September.

That's thanks to a resurgent team led on offense by MVP contender Drake Maye at quarterback. In year two with Maye under center, the Patriots' offense is a top-10 scoring unit after finishing 30th in points a year ago.

A lot of that can be attributed to Maye's growth in his first year under a new coaching staff. But some of the Patriots' offseason additions have played a role as well, including rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson.

The Patriots' second-round pick out of Ohio State has been a dynamic threat out of the backfield in his first season. He leads the team in yards from scrimmage and total touchdowns through Week 16.

Unfortunately, he left New England's game against Baltimore on ""Sunday Night Football"" with a concussion. Here's how long he'll be out.

How long is TreVeyon Henderson out?

Patriots coach Mike Vrabel said today that Henderson has entered concussion protocol following his head injury against Baltimore.

The timeline for return once players enter the protocol often differs on a player-by-player basis. More often than not, players miss at least one week but it's not unheard of for a quick turnaround.

Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb suffered a concussion in Week 14 and was back in action a week later for the Cowboys' game against the Vikings. It all depends on how quickly a player can pass through the five-step return-to-participation protocol.

TreVeyon Henderson injury update

Henderson suffered a concussion in the second quarter of Sunday night's game during a first-down rush. Ravens safety Alohi Gilman made the tackle on the play and Henderson fell backward and slammed his head on the turf.

Henderson initially tried to return to the huddle but went to the ground and the Patriots' medical staff came onto the field. He was able to walk off the field under his own power and was evaluated.

New England initially said he was ""questionable"" to return to the game but ruled him out for the rest of the contest after halftime. He had three yards on five carries before leaving the game.

Rhamondre Stevenson led the way with Henderson out and finished the game with eight carries for 51 yards and a touchdown.

Patriots QB depth chart

Henderson has taken on a larger role in the offense over the course of the season. New England does have experienced players at the position to help in the case of Henderson's absence, though. Here's a look at the depth chart:

TreVeyon Henderson (injured - concussion)

Rhamondre Stevenson

D'Ernest Johnson

Jashaun Corbin (injured reserve - designated for return)

Deneric Prince (injured reserve)

Antonio Gibson (injured reserve)

Terrell Jennings (injured resere)

Lan Larison (injured reserve)

Stevenson led the team in rushing in 2022 and 2024 and has the experience to lead the ground attack if needed. Johnson would be the only other healthy running back on the active roster unless Corbin is cleared in time.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/23/USAT/87898492007-usatsi-27869139.jpg?crop=4466,2512,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-23 23:00:22.972911

Fields started for the Jets for the majority of the season before ceding his job to Tyrod Taylor.
While Fields was inactive for the last three games, he was designated last week as the Jets' emergency quarterback.
The IR designation closes the book on Fields' season and leaves him with a 2-7 record as the Jets' starter.
Will Justin Fields return to the Jets in 2026?","The New York Jets placed quarterback Justin Fields on injured reserve Tuesday, ending his 2025 season and potentially his tenure with the franchise. Fields missed the last three games with a knee injury that coach Aaron Glenn said did not heal in a timely enough fashion for the signal-caller to return to the field this year.

Fields started for the Jets for the majority of the season before ceding his job to Tyrod Taylor. The latter has been dealing with a pair of injuries of his own, which opened the door for Brady Cook to make back-to-back starts the last two weeks. Cook, an undrafted rookie, projects to remain in the lineup for Sunday's divisional game against the New England Patriots.

While Fields was inactive for the last three games, he was designated last week as the Jets' emergency quarterback.

""We're gonna put Justin on IR,"" Glenn said. ""We tried to see how we can get this to work, but it wasn't getting as better as we would like it. We want to make sure we get a focus on that to make sure we get him better.""

Fields said last week that he underwent an MRI on the injured knee and that the imaging revealed an issue that would keep him out on a ""week-to-week"" basis. The injury occurred in practice ahead of the Dec. 7 loss to the Miami Dolphins.

The IR designation closes the book on Fields' season and leaves him with a 2-7 record as the Jets' starter. It was an up-and-down year for the former first-round pick wherein the lows were tremendously low and the high points were few and far between. Fields threw for fewer than 55 yards in four of his nine starts and in Week 2 against the Buffalo Bills completed just three of his 11 pass attempts in one of the worst games by an NFL quarterback this season.

Although he threw just one interception on the year, Fields was highly inefficient in completing 62.7% of his passes for 1,259 yards. He did make an impact as a ballcarrier, though, rushing for 383 yards and four touchdowns.

Will Justin Fields return to the Jets in 2026?

Fields signed with the Jets last spring on a two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million guaranteed. While he remains under contract through 2026, it became clear this season that he is unlikely to be part of the team's long-term plans, and both sides could likely benefit from parting ways at the end of the year.

Adding to the likelihood that Fields and the Jets break up before the 2026 season is the fact that New York will receive an early-first round draft pick and could use it on a quarterback. Unless they feel as though Cook could develop into a capable starter, the leader of their 2026 offense is probably not yet on their roster.

The Jets would incur $22 million in dead cap space if they cut Fields after the season. Fields could command interest on the trade market as a backup, though, and still possesses upside as a potential post-hype breakout candidate in the right situation.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/23/5f71778d-26c6-4e06-862e-7012ca17a11b/thumbnail/1200x675/0c86f710cd91e325d396d2a185a06623/gettyimages-2249234421-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 23:00:37.776414

“I mean, still sore,” Allen said.","On Sunday against the Browns, Bills quarterback Josh Allen retreated toward his own end zone before falling down near the goal line. Along the way, the 2024 MVP “tweaked” his foot (as he said after the game).

Allen’s added at the time that the foot “just flamed up” on him but the “pain subsided,” so he finished the game. His response as to whether the foot affected him in the second half (“no, I don’t think so”) was not particularly convincing.

As a Week 17 game against the Eagles approaches, there’s a question regarding whether the foot will be a factor. On Tuesday, coach Sean McDermott said Allen might miss practice time due to the “obviously sore” foot.

Allen separately provided a more positive assessment.

“Feels good,” Allen said, via Alaina Getzenberg of ESPN.com. “Feels good. Ready to go.”

Per Getzenberg, Allen walked with a limp after the midweek press conference.

More will be revealed regarding Allen’s status on Wednesday, when the Bills release their first injury report for the week.

“I mean, still sore,” Allen said. “Walk-through today, so really not practice in general. So yeah . . . feeling good.”

Mitchell's arrival comes after rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson went down with a head injury in Sunday's win over the Baltimore Ravens. Earlier on Tuesday, Pats head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed Henderson is in concussion protocol.

Mitchell, 27, spent his first three NFL seasons (2021-23) with the 49ers. He totaled 1,523 rushing yards and nine touchdowns on 327 carries over 27 games in San Francisco.

In 2024, Mitchell was placed on season-ending injured reserve due to a hamstring injury. He signed a one-year contract with the Kansas City Chiefs before the 2025 season and played in only one game before being released on Dec. 20.

MORE PATRIOTS

Mitchell will serve as Henderson insurance if the explosive second-rounder is forced to sit out next Sunday's game against the New York Jets. If Henderson is sidelined, Rhamondre Stevenson is expected to handle the bulk of the work in the Patriots' backfield.

New England also announced center/guard Brenden Jaimes was signed to the 53-man roster from the practice squad, tackle Sebastian Gutierrez was released from the practice squad, and defensive tackle Joshua Farmer (hamstring) was placed on injured reserve.

The Packers listed quarterback Jordan Love as a limited participant at Tuesday’s practice. He is dealing with a shoulder injury and a concussion; the latter knocked him out of Green Bay’s loss to the Bears on Saturday night.

In his first season with the New York Jets and fourth overall, tight end Smartt played 20 offensive snaps and eight more on special teams while matching a career high with five receptions for 43 yards in the team’s 29-6 road loss to the New Orleans Saints. The five catches were his first of the season, while the start was the seventh of his career.

Fields, 26, missed Week 3 with a concussion but returned to start the next seven games.","FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Justin Fields' first season with the New York Jets -- and, quite possibly, his last -- is officially over.

The former starting quarterback was placed on injured reserve Tuesday, an ignominious cap to a disappointing season.

Fields, who was benched Nov. 17, has been bothered in recent weeks by what the team called knee ""soreness."" He returned to practice last week but told reporters that he still wasn't healthy enough to play. He was inactive for the past three games.

""Man, we tried to see how we can get this to work, but it wasn't getting as better as we would like it,"" coach Aaron Glenn said. ""So, we want to make sure we get a focus on that to make sure we get him better.""

In all likelihood, Fields wouldn't have played anyway.

He reported soreness two weeks after his benching and hasn't played since. He was replaced by Tyrod Taylor, who got hurt in his third start. That led the Jets (3-12) to undrafted rookie Brady Cook, who will make his third start Sunday against the New England Patriots at MetLife Stadium.

There's a good chance the Jets will part ways with Fields in the offseason.

The former Chicago Bears first-round pick signed a two-year, $40 million contract in free agency and was named the starter in the offseason, but he fell short of modest expectations.

Fields went 2-7 as the starter, ranking 28th out of 32 qualified passers in Total QBR (37.3) -- below his career mark (45.3). He passed for only 505 yards in his past five starts, prompting Glenn to bench him.

Glenn declined to comment on whether Fields will need surgery. He also wouldn't address Fields' future, saying he's focused on New England.

""Any player that doesn't have the season that we would like for them to have, it's always disappointing,"" Glenn said. ""I don't want to just focus on Justin with this -- and I know that's the question asked -- but any player that we have high hopes for and the season don't go the way we want to go, we're always disappointed with that.""

Fields is due to count $23 million on the 2026 cap, including $20 million in salary ($10 million guaranteed). There would be $22 million in dead money if the Jets cut him, which can be spread over two years if he's designated as a post-June 1 cut.

The Jets might opt for a complete reset at quarterback, which could mean adding a veteran and a rookie.

Fields raised eyebrows Nov. 26 with a response to a question about whether he would be open to a small package of plays as a Wildcat quarterback -- a way to capitalize on his speed. Fields said there had been discussions about using him in that role, but he told reporters that he had ""mixed feelings"" about it.

He said he wanted to be a team player but expressed concern about the potential for injury, saying he would be prone to soft tissue injuries from going into a game cold. He noted that he was ""still not necessarily as healthy as I want to be right now."" He was listed with a knee injury for one week in October; it didn't cost him any practice time.

Fields, 26, missed Week 3 with a concussion but returned to start the next seven games. Glenn was prepared to bench him in Week 8 -- the same week owner Woody Johnson was publicly critical of Fields -- but the coach stayed with him because Taylor was out with a knee injury that flared up late in the week.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1223%2Fr1593178_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 20:01:46.630246

""We're going to put Justin on IR,"" Glenn told reporters at a late afternoon news conference. ""It wasn't getting better, as we would like it. We want to make sure we get a focus on that, make sure we get him better.""

Fields injured his knee during the practice week before the Jets played host to Miami on Dec. 8 and had been deactivated for the games against the Dolphins, Jaguars and Saints. He was listed as the Jets' emergency third QB for New Orleans but did not play.

Glenn, asked if Fields would need surgery on the knee, said: ""I'm going to let the docs hone in on that. If he does, this would be a great time to get it done so we can get it knocked out and he can get healthy. I don't want to place that on him. I just know we want to make sure he can get this thing healthy.""

The coach declined to respond to a question about anticipating Fields returning to the Green & White next season. ""We'll see how that goes,"" he said. ""We're focused on New England right now.""

Fields came to the Jets as an unrestricted free agent in March after three seasons as the Bears' 11th overall selection in the 2021 draft and last year with the Steelers. There were high hopes among the Jets and Fields that he would continue his steady progress as an NFL starting QB.

He took the offense's reins from his arrival and started nine of the Jets' first 10 games, missing only the Week 3 game at Tampa Bay while he was in the NFL's concussion protocol. Some elements of Fields' game went well. He threw no interceptions in his first seven games and one for the season. His scrambling and running ability were as advertised as he logged 383 yards and four touchdowns on 71 carries for a 5.4 yards/carry average.

However, Fields' and the Jets' passing offense was up and down. He recorded passing games of 218, 226, 283 and 244 yards but only the 244-yard game came in a victory, the 39-38 comeback win at Cincinnati. But he managed a 45-yard passing game against Denver and 54 yards in the 27-20 home win over the Browns. Injuries cut short his starts in Week 2 vs. Buffalo and Week 7 vs. Carolina and Glenn opted to start Tyrod Taylor at Baltimore and in the win over Atlanta in the two games before Fields' practice knee injury.

For the season, Fields' passing line reads 128-of-204 (62.7% accuracy), 1,259 yards, 7 touchdown passes and 1 INT. He was sacked 27 times. His starting record was 2-7.

""This is for any player that doesn't have the season we would like for them to have. It's always disappointing,"" Glenn said. ""I don't want to focus on Justin with this. Any player that we have high hopes for and the season doesn't go the way we wanted to go, we're always disappointed in that.""

Rookie free agent Brady Cook has been announced to make his third consecutive start in the Jets' final MetLife Stadium appearance against the Patriots on Sunday. Taylor battled through groin and knee injuries that kept him sidelined the past two games. He was the Jets' backup quarterback if needed against the Saints but didn't play.

Max Brosmer will make his second career start on Thursday in place of McCarthy. His first NFL start came in Week 13, where the Vikings were blanked by the Seattle Seahawks, 26-0. Brosmer threw for 126 yards and four interceptions in that matchup.

Despite the late-season injury, the Vikings are not placing McCarthy on injured reserve. He missed the second half of Sunday's 16-13 victory against the New York Giants with the hand injury, and completed 9 of 14 passes for 108 yards and one interception.

It's another unfortunate development for McCarthy, who has already missed 23 of 32 career games due to various injuries.

Is J.J. McCarthy, who flashed at times but was largely inconsistent and occasionally awful, the team's starting quarterback in 2026?
After the second-year pro hurt his hand in Sunday's win over the Giants, there's no point in him playing again in 2025.
The problem is that J.J. McCarthy is out.","The Vikings (7-8) added another win to their December total by defeating the New York Giants 16-13 on Sunday at MetLife Stadium. Minnesota moved to 3-0 in December games this season, with all three victories coming against NFC East opponents (31-0 vs. Washington in Week 14 and 34-26 at Dallas on Sunday Night Football and the victory last week).

Tack on the 5-0 record the Vikings earned in December a year ago, and Minnesota is 8-0 in the final month of the calendar year since 2024 – the only team in the NFL with an unblemished record in those games. Going back to the start of Kevin O'Connell's tenure as head coach in 2022, Minnesota owns the third-best record in the NFL in December with a 12-4 mark.

Only the Bills (15-1) and the Los Angeles Rams (13-4) have a better record during that span, but both of those teams dropped a game in December within the past two seasons. Coincidentally, the Bills lost to the Rams 44-42 in Week 14 of the 2024 season. Meanwhile, the Rams perfect December run ended just five days ago when former Viking Sam Darnold led the Seahawks to a 38-37 overtime victory on Thursday Night Football after trailing 30-14 in the fourth quarter.

The Vikings have now won three straight and will have a chance to finish above .500, with two home games remaining. That's all fine and nice, but the win over the Giants also came with QB J.J. McCarthy suffering a throwing-hand injury, [and he is out this week]. McCarthy no doubt has had some bad injury luck in his two NFL seasons, but it calls into question whether his sometimes reckless playing style can make him an unquestioned NFL starter. How the Vikings approach the QB position this offseason will be fascinating. On the one hand, they likely haven't seen enough to know one way or another whether he's the future, but on the other, it would be tough to go into next season without another higher-quality alternative.

The Vikings have a decision to make. Is J.J. McCarthy, who flashed at times but was largely inconsistent and occasionally awful, the team's starting quarterback in 2026? Or do they believe enough in their ability to win now to kick the tires on a Kyler Murray or Tua Tagovailoa?

It's a conversation that is already being had in the Twin Cities, but it's a tomorrow problem. Now, it's about playing out the string and shutting down McCarthy. After the second-year pro hurt his hand in Sunday's win over the Giants, there's no point in him playing again in 2025.

The Vikings still have a shot at finishing above .500, which is not what Minnesota was shooting for coming off a 14-3 season, but it would be a positive in an otherwise frustrating season. The problem is that J.J. McCarthy is out. That won't make it easy to win one remaining game, much less both of them. But playing well late should give the Vikings the belief that they can be a playoff team in 2026, as long as the quarterback play improves.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/yar5prdbalmzix1nybhj,N,,2025-12-23 18:14:02.934174
,,2025-12-23 22:55:33+00:00,NFL.com,"NFL Power Rankings, Week 17: Seahawks reclaim No. 1 spot, while Jaguars hit top 5",Eric Edholm,,,,,https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-power-rankings-week-17-2025-nfl-season,"The Panthers landed the first blow against the Buccaneers on Sunday, but the all-important Week 18 rematch in Tampa looms.
That might be what these very temporary rankings suggest right now, but who knows what this week will bring?
Simply winning the final two games doesn't guarantee a playoff spot, thanks to Pittsburgh's win in Detroit.
Was Sunday their final game as Saints in the Superdome?
That’s what nine straight losses have done to the G-Men, whose season clearly peaked with the Week 6 win over Philadelphia.","This is an interesting playoff race. One that's less about who's getting in and more about how seeding shakes out.

In the AFC, five teams (the Broncos, Patriots, Jaguars, Chargers and Bills) have officially clinched a postseason slot, and we pretty much know who'll get the remaining two bids: the Steelers and Texans, barring something crazy. The NFC also has five teams locked into the playoff field: the Bears, Eagles and three-fourths of the NFC West (sorry, Cardinals).

The Ravens and Lions aren't dead yet, but they're on life support. The one true ""coin toss"" situation is in the NFC South. The Panthers landed the first blow against the Buccaneers on Sunday, but the all-important Week 18 rematch in Tampa looms.

It might feel like things are fairly settled, but that's far from the case. The Broncos and Rams were skating toward the No. 1 seeds in their respective conferences, but last week's losses hurt -- especially for the Rams, who dropped down to the sixth seed. The NFC West race is remarkably fluid, and the 49ers somehow could steal the darned thing, even if the Rams remain fully capable of hoisting the Lombardi Trophy in February.

So, are the Seahawks the best team in football? That might be what these very temporary rankings suggest right now, but who knows what this week will bring? It's a fool's errand, but we keep fetching answers.

I couldn't have imagined vaulting the Seahawks into the top spot after a game in which they allowed 581 yards and lost the turnover battle, 3-0, but here we are. Seattle has been here before, and I clearly have served as the team's white knight for various stretches, but I admit I am making this elevation with sincere hesitation. These Seahawks scare me, too, as good as they truly are. Sam Darnold deserves a ton of credit for bouncing back after throwing two bad interceptions on the prime-time stage, and there's undeniable fight/grit to this squad. Even still, the NFC West and the No. 1 seed are not locked up yet, and Nick Emmanwori, Coby Bryant and Riq Woolen all suffered injuries in last Thursday's big win. The 'Hawks can wrap everything up with two more victories, but games against the Panthers and 49ers will be no cakewalk.

Down 11 points in the fourth quarter, on the road, with several key players injured, Drake Maye and the Patriots refused to die. Maye caught fire in the final quarter, leading two long touchdown drives, with Rhamondre Stevenson's TD romp giving the Pats a lead they wouldn't relinquish. The comeback win clinched a playoff berth for New England, moving the team into a dominant position to also claim the AFC East crown in the next two weeks. Losing Offensive Rookie of the Year candidate TreVeyon Henderson (concussion protocol) for any length of time would be a worry, and as mentioned above, that wasn't the only notable health setback the Pats suffered in the game. They're very thin on both lines of scrimmage right now but should eventually get help from players returning from IR, including OT Will Campbell and DT Milton Williams. They'll be warmly welcomed back to a team that has outplayed all expectations and will be a fascinating case study in the postseason.

The Bills survived a tough game at Cleveland. The Browns had two fourth-quarter possessions while facing a three-point deficit, but Sean McDermott's defense got a pair of much-needed stops. Before that, it was a fire drill, as Cleveland ran the ball efficiently and Shedeur Sanders made some wild plays. The Bills' D remains a concern, and they're still going to need more from players not named Josh Allen and James Cook. But let's also give credit where it's due: This is Buffalo's sixth consecutive season with 11 or more victories, the longest active streak in the NFL. It really hasn't been easy at times this year, but there's a mental toughness baked into this roster that can't be dismissed. Unfortunately for Buffalo, New England came back to beat Baltimore on Sunday night, slimming down the Bills' already-lean chances of winning a sixth straight AFC East crown.

The Broncos' celebrated defense had its hands pretty full with the Jaguars for most of a frustrating day, while Bo Nix and the offense never found that fourth-quarter magic we're so used to seeing them summon. In a game that felt like a Divisional Round playoff matchup, Jacksonville took a few early punches and fought back hard. Missed tackles were a problem for Denver's defense. Jags QB Trevor Lawrence took some sacks but also hit some big plays against the blitz. LB Dre Greenlaw's late injury also bears watching. It was a disappointing result all the way around, especially with the top seed in the AFC there for the taking. Now, even the division is in some doubt. This Thursday's Christmas night game in Kansas City looks far easier, with both Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew out, but the Week 18 showdown with the Chargers suddenly looms very large.

What a statement performance from the barnburning Jaguars, who keep one-upping themselves en route to a potentially historic season. First, there was the monumental win (at the time) over the Chiefs. Then the stomping of the Chargers at home. But Sunday's triumph felt different, with Jacksonville going into Denver's den and really seizing control of the game. Trevor Lawrence turned in one of his best performances, and he's been on fire lately with 19 TDs (16 passing, three rushing) in the Jags' six-game win streak, including a whopping 10 in the past two. The defense also served up a reminder against the Broncos that it's better than people realize, coming up with some big stops and heating up the pass rush late. Who says Jacksonville can't make a Super Bowl run in Liam Coen's first year? The AFC is wide open.

With Saturday night's thrilling OT victory over rival Green Bay, Chicago now has 11 wins -- with six of them coming after the Bears trailed in the final two minutes of regulation. They needed a face-mask penalty on third-and-20 and a recovered onside kick, among other things, in order to pull out that miracle against the Packers, which demonstrates both their extraordinary resilience and their propensity to make things harder than they need to be. The reward for those late-game heroics is that the Bears have clinched a playoff spot, they are the overwhelming favorites to win the NFC North, and the No. 1 seed remains possible. Simply beating the 49ers and Lions might not get it done, however, and as Ben Johnson said in the locker room after Saturday's win: ""We need to get better."" If the Bears do, Chicago might not know what to do with itself.

When this 49ers offense is on, it can be an absolute buzzsaw. San Francisco has a punter who hasn’t kicked since November! The Colts are pretty battered defensively, but the 49ers had their way with them all night until Brock Purdy ’s late pick kept the door open for a minute. Otherwise, Purdy was terrific on Monday night, throwing a career-high five TD passes and some absolute beauts. The flip side is that Philip Rivers kind of made mincemeat of San Francisco's defense, at least until Dee Winters ended it with his pick-six. The Niners made sure not to let Jonathan Taylor get going, but Rivers had open receivers from which to choose. If the 49ers can get back to that Panthers game level of performance, I’d like them a bit more. But there’s still a decent pathway toward stealing the NFC West and putting themselves in a very favorable spot. If that happens, I’ll gladly slide them up.

The Rams went from blowing the Seahawks out of their own building midway through the fourth quarter ... to ultimately dropping five slots to the NFC's No. 6 seed. Coughing up a 30-14 lead last Thursday and eventually losing when Seattle TE Eric Saubert caught a two-point conversion in overtime, Sean McVay's team suffered a setback that was simply shocking, especially on a night when it rang up 581 yards of offense and didn't turn the ball over. There certainly were plenty of missteps, including those on special teams that led to the somewhat-stunning firing of coordinator Chase Blackburn. Not that the Rams' special teams have been good on the whole -- they haven't -- but how often do we see Super Bowl contenders axe coaches in late December? Had Los Angeles stopped Seattle's final two-point try, would Blackburn have kept his job? Who knows? But all of a sudden, everything we thought about the Rams and their playoff path -- even with Matthew Stafford offering up another MVP-worthy performance -- has been thrown into the blender.

There have been plenty of times recently where the offense has really labored to put together consistent performances, but Sunday was not one of those days. Justin Herbert was terrific, and the offense survived yet another injury at left tackle, with Jamaree Salyer going down early in the game. Whether the Chargers' ease of execution was more about themselves or about facing Dallas is debatable, but it was good to see, nonetheless. Quentin Johnston was back, Ladd McConkey got back in the end zone, and Herbert played at a playoff-ready level. The defense took a few early shots but really finished well. The next two games are barnburners -- vs. Houston, at Denver -- so there's no rest for the weary, but that's now four straight wins and another move up.

The Texans won their seventh straight game on Sunday, but the close-shave victory over the lowly Raiders induced several rounds of boos from the NRG Stadium crowd. Houston's ballyhooed defense gave the team an early lift with Derek Stingley Jr.'s pick-six, but it also allowed Las Vegas to score 21 points and rip off a surprising number of big plays. Meanwhile, the Texans' offense didn't score a touchdown until midway through the fourth quarter, resurfacing concerns about the shape of that unit. The Jaguars' win in Denver also kept the chances higher that the Texans will have to go on the road if and when they clinch a postseason bid.

It wasn't pretty, but beating Washington iced the NFC East crown for Philadelphia, ending a two-decade run of the division never having back-to-back champs. The Eagles played good defense against the Commanders without Jalen Carter, and the offense has slowly started to regain something of an identity in recent games against lesser opponents. Saquon Barkley found some lanes and helped close it out, while Dallas Goedert caught his 10th TD pass of the season. Sure, Philly needed some help from Washington in this one, but the Super Bowl LIX champions took care of business in the end. Just how viable the Eagles are as Super Bowl LX contenders is ripe for debate, but they're at least trending back in the right direction prior to a tough test and playoff tune-up at Buffalo.

It was nothing short of a demoralizing loss in Chicago. The Packers seemed to be in complete command, up 10 late in the fourth quarter, before eventually falling in overtime. And QB Jordan Love left the game with a concussion, making his status unclear for the final two weeks of the regular season. The division-title dreams aren't completely dashed, but Chicago is now firmly in the captain's chair. It's easy to point to the slew of late-game errors -- the face mask, the onside kick, the bomb TD in OT -- as to why the Packers lost, but they also made their bed early in the game. A 16-6 lead should have been much larger, with the Packers coming up short in the red zone. They were 0-for-5 scoring touchdowns down there, including 0-for-3 in goal-to-go situations. They were stopped on downs on the opening drive at the Chicago 7-yard line and fumbled inside Chicago's 5 in the third quarter. Those shortcomings ended up being just as damaging in the end.

You can make a strong case that Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell are co-MVPs for this team, combining for 279 of the team’s 481 yards and scoring all three touchdowns at Detroit. The Steelers were in trouble just before the half, down 10-3 prior to Gainwell’s miracle TD, and they controlled the next quarter and a half to take a 22-10 lead. Warren ripped off a pair of 45-yard TD runs to put the game away, although Pittsburgh had to hang on for dear life, surviving a missed chip shot by Chris Boswell and two OPI calls negating Detroit touchdowns. After the Ravens blew their Sunday night game, the Steelers moved into a dominant position in the division race, but they'll be without receiver DK Metcalf for the final two games of the regular season, after he was suspended by the league for a testy midgame altercation with a fan. Always something interesting with this team.

In an electric environment at Bank of America Stadium, the Panthers primed their fans for a home playoff game with a stirring win over the rival Buccaneers to take control of the NFC South. Win out, including the Week 18 game at Tampa, and the Panthers will be hosting in Round 1 -- possibly against a Rams team they beat in Charlotte less than a month ago. Bryce Young is starting to earn a reputation as a late-game finisher, logging his 12th game-winning drive over the past three seasons. Young made several big throws and escaped pressure with some timely scrambles, and Tetairoa McMillan had his biggest game in a month. There were also heroes on defense, including Lathan Ransom -- Week 15's goat with a late penalty -- who intercepted Baker Mayfield to ice the game.

The Lions’ season, for all intents and purposes, might have come to an end on a failed fourth-and-goal play -- one of the wilder ones you’ll see -- and it was somewhat fitting for a frustrating campaign in Detroit. Their playoff chances aren’t completely gone, but it’s going to take something miraculous to get them in now. Two more road games remain, and the Lions need to win one just to avoid finishing below .500. They just never caught fire after the bye, and on Sunday, they suffered a second straight loss for the first time in more than three years. Detroit’s run game has stalled, and a beat-up offensive line has something to do with that. The Steelers also had their way with the Lions' defense, which has been competitive but unable to stop the bleeding. It’s a tough finish for a team that had taken the league by storm the past two seasons. It doesn’t appear to be in the cards this time around.

Lamar Jackson left Sunday night's game against the Patriots with a back injury, the Ravens blew an 11-point lead with 10 minutes left and now their playoff hopes are on life support. Simply winning the final two games doesn't guarantee a playoff spot, thanks to Pittsburgh's win in Detroit. Now comes the big-picture question that I've held back on asking until now: Are we sure John Harbaugh will return in 2026? The Ravens will finish this season 3-6 at home -- more losses in Baltimore than they had in the two previous seasons combined. With Jackson's status unknown and Baltimore traditionally struggling without him in the lineup, the Ravens could be headed for a 10-loss campaign. The future of this proud franchise feels like it's hanging in the balance right now.

Even with Philip Rivers ’ late pick-six, he wasn’t the reason the Colts lost Monday night. The defense couldn’t get a stop for the first three and a half quarters, looking helpless against the Niners’ high-powered attack. It hurt that Sauce Gardner remained sidelined, but DeForest Buckner ’s return couldn’t lift this beleaguered unit at all. The D played well at Seattle in Rivers’ debut but otherwise has had a tough run recently. Rivers was making throws and nearly matching the 49ers, score for score, until the late mistake. It’s clear he’s been game-ready, even if the Colts dropped both games, ending all realistic hope for a miracle playoff run. What a strange, fascinating but ultimately disappointing season in Indianapolis.

The Buccaneers might still have the statistical edge to make it into the playoff field over Carolina, but anyone who has seen this team lately is sure to have a different opinion about how the next two weeks will play out. Todd Bowles did his best Lee Elia rant after the botch job against Atlanta, and his team still suffered another crushing loss. Driving for the game-tying field goal or the go-ahead touchdown against the Panthers, Baker Mayfield threw a back-breaking interception to put the Bucs in a win-or-else situation heading into Weeks 17 and 18. Tampa Bay’s defense didn’t allow many yards, but it was way too loose at the ends of both halves, allowing the go-ahead scores to give Carolina the momentum it needed. The Bucs can still take this division by beating the Panthers in the final regular-season game, but a loss at Miami this Sunday could end it early.

The Vikings have now won three straight and will have a chance to finish above .500, with two home games remaining. That’s all fine and nice, but the win over the Giants also came with QB J.J. McCarthy suffering a throwing-hand injury, leaving his availability in doubt -- again. McCarthy undoubtedly has had some bad injury luck in his two NFL seasons, but it calls into question whether his sometimes-reckless playing style can make him an unquestioned NFL starter. How the Vikings approach the QB position this offseason will be fascinating. On the one hand, they likely haven't seen enough to know one way or another whether McCarthy's the future, but on the other, it would be tough to go into next season without another higher-quality alternative.

The defense had a little flourish after the trade-deadline acquisition of Quinnen Williams, but the afterglow is gone following another stinker on that side of the ball. It's fair to point out that the personnel is still quite lacking in multiple spots, but the Cowboys can't be happy with 140 points allowed in their past four games. The temperature's rising around coordinator Matt Eberflus, but if the franchise makes a change, it would introduce Dallas' fourth defensive coordinator in as many years. You saw Brian Schottenheimer's lack of faith in the unit when he opted to go for it on fourth-and-1 from the Chargers' 16-yard line in a seven-point game late in the third quarter. Los Angeles stopped Dallas on the play and then scored the final 10 points of the game.

The Chiefs’ season was already slipping away before Patrick Mahomes ’ torn ACL, but watching them struggle mightily against the Titans after Gardner Minshew suffered his own knee injury was quite revealing. There was a time when the mighty Chiefs could have absorbed losing Mahomes and still managed to beat an opponent near the bottom of the standings, but that time is not now. Say what you will about Kansas City not having something to play for, but it’s hard not to notice that Mahomes -- even with his warts, and as tough as this season has been -- often has covered up the team's other shortcomings. Perhaps this clarity will seep into the offseason plans, because bouncing back next season won’t be any finger snap.

My unsolicited advice to the Falcons: ride Bijan Robinson and be smart with Drake London . The Falcons aren’t going to the playoffs, and it was clear Sunday in London’s return to the field that he didn’t look right. Head coach Raheem Morris chalked it up to the star receiver being rusty, but the Falcons don't gain much by working him full throttle in these final two games. Robinson should be the workhorse down the stretch as he chases an All-Pro bid and keeps adding to his league-leading scrimmage-yards total (2,026). Even with the Falcons being stuffed on two fourth-quarter fourth-and-1s in the win, Robinson is their best chance to play spoiler against the Rams and beat the suddenly competent Saints. Atlanta needs to be competitive down the stretch, with owner Arthur Blank reportedly set to evaluate the futures of Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot after the season went off the tracks quickly.

Amid all the doom and gloom and speculation about Joe Burrow, the quarterback followed up his bad game in a shoutout loss with one of his best performances of the season in a blowout win. Tee Higgins also brightened the mood with his return, kicking off the scoring in Miami. Throw in a big game from Chase Brown and a strong rebound from the Bengals' defense following a tough start, and there were a surprising number of positives coming out of Sunday -- or as many as there could be for a team out of the playoffs. It also helps out Zac Taylor's case as the Bengals weigh what changes to make in the offseason. I suspect they'll be keeping the core in place, hoping for better luck in 2026. Sunday was a reminder it can work, even if the weight of the opponent must be taken into account.

Rookie QB Tyler Shough became the Saints' first 300-yard passer in two calendar years, and he did it while throwing to Chris Olave and a host of backups at receiver, with New Orleans' top three running backs also out. Things were a little sluggish early, but after Taysom Hill converted a fake punt, Shough warmed up and the offense started rolling as Olave tore up the Jets time and time again. The wide receiver's future in New Orleans was once cloudy, but now he projects to being Shough's go-to target next season. Hill also got in on the fun Sunday with a TD pass, and a pair of 36-year-olds, Cameron Jordan and Demario Davis, led a dominant defensive performance against the Jets. All three players are longtime Saints stalwarts whose futures are up in the air. Was Sunday their final game as Saints in the Superdome?

Quinn Ewers' first start wasn't nearly as bad as the final score (45-21) indicated, but a solid first half was followed by two interceptions and a failed fourth-down sneak. On the rare occasions the Bengals pressured Ewers, he struggled; otherwise, he sort of looked the part, albeit against one of the league's worst defenses. Mike McDaniel made the call to bench Tua Tagovailoa and elevate Ewers over QB2 Zach Wilson, and his decision hasn't backfired on him yet. Sadly, the defense was beaten like a drum by Joe Burrow and Co. That's two rough games in a row on that side of the ball after the unit had shown some promise against the Saints and Jets. Draw whatever conclusions you want, but it's hard not to think the competition mattered.

The Commanders came out strong against the Eagles and even appeared primed to pull an upset in the first half, but the game -- just like Washington's season -- crumbled remarkably fast. Every team has dealt with significant injuries this season, but the Commanders' woes have been particularly painful. Marcus Mariota left with a hand injury, and several others were also hurt: Jaylin Lane, Brandon Coleman, Sam Cosmi and Jer'Zhan Newton. Making matters worse, Javon Kinlaw and Quan Martin were both ejected, putting them in line for potential fines/suspensions. At 4-11, that only means so much, but it's tough to see things come so unglued, even after Washington ended the eight-game losing streak in Week 15.

The Cardinals started the season 2-0, but now they're trending toward a top-five draft pick. Seven straight losses (and 12 in the past 13 games) will have that kind of effect on a team. The fact that eight of Arizona's defeats -- including Sunday’s setback to the Falcons, which dropped the Cards to 1-7 at home -- have been by one score is no anodyne for what’s become a pretty miserable campaign. Sunday also added pain in the form of another disappointing performance by Marvin Harrison Jr. in his return to the field, including a TD drop, and an injury to Josh Sweat , who’s been one of the few bright spots on defense. Calais Campbell continues to defy age with a blocked extra point that kept the game tied at halftime, and Michael Carter made plays for a struggling backfield, but the negatives far outweigh the positives in the big picture.

Don’t look now, but that’s three straight multi-TD passing performances from Cam Ward after he’d failed to throw for more than one in any of his first 12 games. Beating the Chiefs deserved celebration for the downtrodden Titans, even if the win came against a team that was a shell of itself after losing both Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew . Jeffery Simmons continues to play hard for the Titans, notching a safety, two pass breakups and a pair of tackles for loss, and the defense followed suit with its best statistical outing since at least Week 1. Winning two of the past three has helped lift the mood in the building, and beating Kansas City had to carry extra weight for GM Mike Borgonzi (with the Chiefs in 2009-2024), even if there are still a lot of holes to plug and the victories have severely damaged the Titans’ chances of landing a top-three draft pick for next April.

Shedeur Sanders was better against the Bills than he was against the Bears one week prior, ripping some confident throws and conjuring up some magic in a game the Browns had legitimate chances to win. But on the flip side, he also turned the ball over twice and was guilty of a grounding penalty deep in Cleveland territory in a one-score game late. He was good but not quite good enough. The Browns are in position to land a top-five draft pick in 2026, and they have the ammunition (also owning the Jaguars' first-rounder) to make a big push for a quarterback. Sanders hasn't yet done enough to assure the team will pass on one. How he finishes the season and whether Myles Garrett breaks the sack record -- he's one full sack away -- are the best reasons to tune into Cleveland in its final two games, which is more watchability than most teams in this range can boast.

Although Brady Cook wasn't terrible, he had another two fourth-quarter turnovers in the Jets' loss to the Saints, turning a 16-6 deficit into a blowout. Cook will start again this Sunday against the Patriots, but it's clear that the Jets will enter the offseason as one of the teams most in need of solving their long-term QB issues. Aaron Glenn made a change at defensive coordinator last week, and it resulted in some better play (for a while, anyway) on that side of the ball. But how the Jets have gone this entire season without an interception -- an NFL-record 15 straight games -- deserves a well-funded study. It's something that feels nigh impossible -- or, at the very least, only capable of happening to the Jets.

It’s now virtually a dead heat for who’ll get the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, with the Giants and Raiders leading the way and the Browns and Jets still in contention. That’s what nine straight losses have done to the G-Men, whose season clearly peaked with the Week 6 win over Philadelphia. Even with six of those defeats coming by one score, including Sunday's 16-13 loss to Minnesota, it’s hard to find much silver lining with the Giants now, as beat up as they are. This Sunday’s game at Las Vegas is essentially both teams’ Draft Super Bowl, and it’s possible that both head coaches in that showdown are in their penultimate contests with their respective clubs. Mike Kafka hasn’t won as an interim coach, and his offense has gone from moderately promising in his first few games to pretty disappointing over the past few.

Pete Carroll might be embattled, and the Raiders might have lost their ninth straight game, but they came out and battled the Texans for four quarters in Houston, nearly pulling out what would have been a shocking win. The most encouraging aspect, regardless of what happens after the season, was seeing Ashton Jeanty break out for his best game of the year, with a 60-yard TD catch to give the Raiders a third-quarter lead and a 51-yard TD run that made it a two-point game with under six minutes remaining. The Raiders couldn't pull it out, but seeing Jeanty thrive was one of the more welcome developments in a lost season.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/vlujuwxlp78rkb15fqz8,N,,2025-12-23 20:02:33.836725

McCarthy will miss Thursday’s game against the Detroit Lions. He injured his right hand late in the first half of Sunday’s game against the New York Giants, and coach Kevin O’Connell ruled him out on Tuesday after testing revealed a small hairline fracture.

“It’s a bummer,” O’Connell said. “It’s been really fun. Although the week-to-week judgment of players and decisions and all these things that are noise, I understand it all. But the most fun part of this, and the most real part of this, is coaching a young player on his journey where we’ve started to see things click for him.”

McCarthy’s status for the Week 18 matchup with the Green Bay Packers is uncertain, but the team does not think he will require surgery, and he will not be placed on injured reserve. O’Connell said his progress will depend on grip strength.

In the short term, undrafted rookie Max Brosmer will start on Christmas Day against the Lions. The longer-term ramifications are more significant.

Minnesota hoped to see McCarthy finish out the season. These final two weeks, versus NFC North foes, were going to offer meaningful data in the calculus of the Vikings’ offseason quarterback decisions. McCarthy had played well in the two games before Sunday. The injury leaves the Vikings with an incomplete sample.

McCarthy’s lack of availability has been one of two primary concerns. He missed his entire rookie season after suffering a torn meniscus during the preseason. In Week 2 this fall, he suffered a high ankle sprain, which forced him to miss five games. And in Week 12, a Packers defender pounded him into the turf, which sent him into the concussion protocol. McCarthy has only played in nine of the 32 regular-season games the Vikings have played since he was drafted with the No. 10 pick in 2024.

McCarthy didn’t inform the coaches and trainers that he was in pain until several plays later. O’Connell said the team pored over the film from the game to identify the culprit. It’s possible that McCarthy smacked his hand on the helmet of Giants defensive tackle Roy Robertson-Harris with 2:57 remaining in the second quarter. However, two plays following that collision, McCarthy scrambled for a 12-yard touchdown and high-fived teammates.

McCarthy fumbled on the next drive and then reported the injury.

“I think the first time he really felt it was when, after that play, (our trainers) evaluated him,” O’Connell said. “I was right there on the sideline. And he had his first real pain, he said he felt, when they were checking certain spots of his hand.”

O’Connell said he wouldn’t have called a screen pass had he known McCarthy’s hand was hurt.

“Even though he didn’t know it at the time,” O’Connell said, “he was unable to do his job. Which would’ve altered my thinking in the moment.”

The other concern in the big picture has been McCarthy’s play. This season, he has thrown for 1,450 yards, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions with a completion rate of 57.3 percent — the lowest of all 33 qualified quarterbacks. For much of the season, O’Connell discussed the need for McCarthy to rework his lower-body mechanics.

Minnesota has won three games in a row to improve to 7-8, but the season has been a significant disappointment. No team spent more on its 2025 roster than the Vikings. O’Connell and general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah received offseason extensions, yet the team has not won a playoff game since they took over in 2022.

Questions about McCarthy’s health and consistency are likely to lead to another interesting offseason. The Vikings are likely to pursue a trusted veteran who can provide insurance at the quarterback position. They have plenty of other decisions to make, too, including the potential renewal of defensive coordinator Brian Flores’ contract and potential roster cuts like defensive tackle Javon Hargrave.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/22141927/USATSI_27865127-scaled-e1766431276216.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-23 20:02:41.963105

Metcalf faced disciplinary trouble after appearing to aim a punch at a fan during his team’s 29-24 win over the Detroit Lions.

While Metcalf reportedly plans on appealing the suspension, if the ban stands, the big-bodied pass-catcher will forfeit US$555,556 (AU$833,705) for the two missed games.

Per an NFL release, Metcalf’s act violated the league’s policy that dictates “players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day and ... if a player makes unnecessary physical contact with a fan in any way that constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct or presents crowd-control issues and/or risk of injury, he will be held accountable.”

The incident occurred during the second quarter, when Metcalf could be seen getting into an exchange with a Lions fan wearing a blue wig at Detroit’s Ford Field.

The confrontation ended with Metcalf apparently striking the fan with his fist before walking away.

The Detroit supporter did not appear to be hurt and responded to Metcalf’s blow by raising his arms aloft in celebration.

It was not immediately clear what caused the confrontation, which rapidly went viral across social media.

Ryan Kennedy, the Lions fan involved in the altercation with Metcalf, “categorically denies using the ‘N-word,’ the ‘C-word’ or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based language during the incident,” according to a statement released by a Michigan law firm on Tuesday morning (AEDT).

“These allegations are completely false,” the statement released by Shawn Head and Sean Murphy of Head Murphy Law Firm reads.

“There are some things that fans will say to you that will get you out of character, but D.K., come on, man,” former NFL wide receiver Nate Burleson said on CBS.

“I don’t know the details, but you cannot let someone get into your head to the point you want to go over there, talk to them, grab them and then, what it looks like, throw a jab.”

The fan who Metcalf appeared to throw a punch at told The Detroit Free Press that the incident left him “a little shocked”.

“My words don’t matter because it was on camera,” he added.

The fan said they called Metcalf by his government name: DeKaylin Zecharius Metcalf.

“I called him that and then he grabbed me and ripped my shirt,” the fan said.

“I’m a little shocked. Like everyone’s talking to me. I’m a little rattled, but I just want the Lions to win, baby.”

The incident echoed a flashpoint involving Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson earlier this season.

Jackson shoved a Buffalo Bills fan during a week one defeat. Jackson was not punished for that incident, which was initiated by the fan in question who was later ejected and banned from the Bills’ Highmark Stadium.

The Steelers ended up winning Monday’s game 29-24 in dramatic fashion, with Lions quarterback Jared Goff seemingly stealing the victory on the final play of the game.

Goff had linked with Amon Ra St. Brown on a fourth-down pass just short of the goal line and with only a few seconds left, Detroit’s top receiver then threw a lateral to his quarterback who scored.

What would have been the game-winning touchdown was rubbed off the board with the officials announcing offensive pass interference in the lead-up, seeing Pittsburgh get home.

Running back Jaylen Warren had two 45-yard touchdown runs in the win while the Lions combined for just 15 yards all up.

PROMISING UPDATE AFTER SCARY SCENES FOR BRONCOS ROOKIE

Elsewhere, Broncos coach Sean Payton provided an “encouraging” update after rookie receiver Pat Bryant was carted off following a brutal hit in Denver’s 34-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Byrant took a hard hit from Jacksonville cornerback Montaric Brown on the penultimate play of the game, with players from both teams later surrounding the young playmaker before he was loaded into a cart and taken off the field to an ambulance.

In a promising update, KUSA-TV’s Mike Klis reported that Bryant was taken to a local hospital for concussion-like symptoms not neurological symptoms, while Payton later told reporters the rookie had “movement” in both his hands and legs.

“So as we know more, we’ll let you know,” he added.

It was a sour note to end a tough night for the Broncos, who entered Monday on an 11-game winning streak.

Jacksonville, however, has also been one of the league’s most in-form teams after blowing away the Jets last week, with quarterback Trevor Lawrence playing some of the best football of his career.

Lawrence completed 23 of 36 passes for 279 yards and three touchdowns while adding another score on the ground.

CHIEFS’ BRUTAL INJURY DEJA-VU

The Chiefs may be down another quarterback.

Kansas City is now worried that quarterback Gardner Minshew tore his ACL when he had to exit their 26-9 loss to the Titans in the opening minute of the game, according to multiple reports.

Minshew will undergo further testing, meaning the Chiefs may have lost two quarterbacks to ACL tears in the span of as many games, after Patrick Mahomes’ season was cut short in their Week 15 loss to the Chargers.

Minshew went down on the third play of the game as he scrambled and fell to the ground.

The injury appeared to be a noncontact one, and he quickly grabbed his left knee.

He did attempt to remain in the game.

Minshew was spotted walking back to the Chiefs’ locker room in the second quarter with members of the medical staff, and he was eventually ruled out for the rest of the game at halftime.

He ended his day completing 3-of-8 passes for 15 yards, and third-string QB Chris Oladokun entered the game with 11 minutes left in the half while Minshew was being examined in the second quarter.

Minshew had been starting in place of Mahomes, who suffered a season-ending torn ACL against the Chargers last week. He has since undergone surgery to address the injury.

The Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention in their loss to the Chargers, but the hope of trying to close out the regular season on some sort of positive note may have hit another snag with their backup potentially down for the count.

The Chiefs have two games left on their schedule, with Denver closing out the home portion of their schedule on Christmas Day and a trip to Las Vegas in Week 18 to face the Raiders. Oladokun would be in line to get the starts in those games.

STANDOUT ROOKIE SUFFERS GRUESOME INJURY

Elsewhere, Browns rookie Quinshon Judkins suffered a gruesome injury in the second quarter of Monday’s game against the Bills, an incident that left the young running back in excruciating pain and forced him to be carted off the field.

It has also ended his season early, with Browns coach Kevin Stefanski revealing after the game that Judkins suffered a fractured fibula and dislocated ankle.

Judkins will need surgery, and he will be done for the year.

“Great teammate, runs hard, cares about this game, cares about the right things, so I’m disappointed for him,” Stefanski told reporters after the game. “He’s disappointed, but he’s not somebody I worry about. He’ll bounce back.”

Quarterback Shedeur Sanders told reporters that it was “sad” to see Judkins go down with the injury.

The scene unfolded when Judkins was making a catch behind the line of scrimmage and was tackled by Bills linebacker Matt Milano.

Judkins remained on his back after the play was ruled dead, and team medical staff quickly came out to tend to the injured Brown.

It appeared on the broadcast that his right leg was bending in the wrong way on the tackle, which was so unpleasant to see that CBS broadcaster Ian Eagle said on air the network would not show the replay of the injury.

Trainers put an air cast on Judkins’ leg after he was placed on a cart to be taken off the field.

The injury came just a few plays after Sanders had come back into the game after suffering a pinky finger issue.

Coming into the game, Judkins had 222 carries for 805 yards and seven touchdowns this season.

CHARGERS, BILLS EDGE CLOSER TO PLAYOFF BERTHS IN OTHER GAMES

In other news, Justin Herbert threw two touchdowns and rushed for another as the Los Angeles Chargers moved to the brink of the NFL playoffs with a 34-17 victory over the already-eliminated Dallas Cowboys.

Chargers quarterback Herbert produced a near flawless performance to set up a convincing win against a Cowboys team whose postseason hopes were snuffed out by Philadelphia’s win over Washington on Sunday.

Herbert finished with 300 passing yards from 23-of-29 attempts with no interceptions, and rushed for 42 yards including a third quarter touchdown.

The win left the Chargers with an 11-4 record in the AFC West, all but guaranteeing they will advance to the postseason.

The Chargers could wrap up a playoff berth if the Indianapolis Colts fail to beat the San Francisco 49ers on Tuesday.

In other early action on Monday, the faltering Tampa Bay Buccaneers stumbled to a 23-20 defeat on the road to the Carolina Panthers in a crucial NFC South divisional tussle.

The Panthers vaulted into first place in the division following the win, which leaves them with an 8-7 record with the Bucs second on 7-8.

The loss was another hammer blow for Tampa Bay, who have taken just one win from their last seven games to allow Carolina to edge past them in the divisional standings.

The Buffalo Bills also powered towards the playoffs with a 23-20 win over the Cleveland Browns.

Bills quarterback Josh Allen had a quiet game with just 130 passing yards and no touchdowns from 12 completions.

Instead it was left to the Bills ground game to grind out victory, with running back James Cook rushing for two touchdowns and 117 yards to set up a win, which takes Buffalo to 11-4 for the season.

Buffalo can qualify for the playoffs if either Houston or Indianapolis fail to win their week 16 fixtures.

The Kansas City Chiefs, eliminated from postseason contention last week, endured another miserable afternoon with a lackluster showing in a 26-9 defeat to the Tennessee Titans (3-12) in Nashville.

The Chiefs’ defeat was compounded by an injury to back-up quarterback Gardner Minshew, who exited in the second quarter with what reports said was a possible anterior cruciate ligament tear.

Chiefs starting quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered an identical injury in last week’s loss to the Chargers.

McCarthy has a ""very, very small hairline fracture"" in his right hand, coach Kevin O'Connell said Tuesday, and won't play in Thursday afternoon's game against the Detroit Lions.

Rookie backup Max Brosmer will start, and the team claimed quarterback Brett Rypien on waivers Tuesday for depth. The Vikings have not ruled out McCarthy from playing in their final regular-season game in Week 18 against the Green Bay Packers.

McCarthy's availability for that game will be based on ""his grip strength and his ability to grip the football and throw the ball,"" O'Connell said.

In either case, it's the fourth significant injury McCarthy has suffered since the Vikings made him the No. 10 pick of the 2024 draft. He has played in only nine of a possible 34 games, including the playoffs, because of a torn meniscus in his right knee, a high right ankle sprain, a concussion and now the fractured hand.

His past three starts have been his best this season, producing the ninth-best QBR (69.1) in the NFL over that period, but he has been unable to stay on the field for more than four consecutive games without injury.

""It's just a bummer,"" O'Connell said, ""because it's been really fun. ... I know the week-to-week judgment of players and decisions and all these things that are noise in many cases, I understand it all. But the most fun part of this, and the most real part of it, is coaching the young player on his journey where we've really started to see, kind of, some things click for him.""

The Vikings are still not certain when the hand injury occurred. Game video from Sunday showed McCarthy hitting his hand on the helmet of New York Giants defensive lineman Roy Robertson-Harris after a throw with 2:57 remaining in the second quarter of the Vikings' 16-13 victory at MetLife Stadium.

But McCarthy managed to throw a short completion on the next play, and then he scrambled 12 yards for a touchdown after that. He opened the Vikings' next possession by handing off to tailback Aaron Jones, but on second down he dropped the ball as he tried to throw a screen pass. Giants safety Tyler Nubin recovered the fumble and returned it 27 yards for a touchdown with 17 seconds remaining in the half.

O'Connell said Tuesday that he had no indication McCarthy was injured until the fumble, and noted that McCarthy gave ""a pretty significant high-five"" to receiver Justin Jefferson after his touchdown. But when he got to the sideline following Nubin's return, McCarthy grimaced in pain when an athletic trainer grabbed his hand.

""If you think about it,"" O'Connell said, ""most of the times he's ended up missing time, he's either stayed in the game or we find out the next day just because he's such a competitor and always wants to stay in the game, which I value so tremendously at that position. But yeah, it was obviously very unfortunate because even though he didn't know it at the time, he was unable to do his job, which obviously would have altered my thinking in the moment. ... As I told J.J., in those circumstances, there's nothing wrong with letting us evaluate you and see if we can get you back out there and Max will step in, and at least allow us to handle the end of the half accordingly with how we see fit to try to maintain the momentum we had at that time.""

Brosmer will step in this week against the Lions, giving him a chance to improve upon his Week 13 debut.

Starting against the Seattle Seahawks while McCarthy was in the concussion protocol, Brosmer threw four interceptions -- including an ill-advised throwaway on fourth down that Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV returned 85 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings were shut out 26-0, and Brosmer's QBR (5.0) for that game ranks No. 472 out of the 480 quarterback starts around the NFL this season.

Brosmer said he relied on a circle of supporters inside and outside of the organization to get him past that moment, largely by avoiding the temptation to make major changes in his preparation.

""My dream has been to play in the NFL for a long time,"" Brosmer said. ""And for me mentally to define myself by one game wouldn't be fair to the younger me, watching me play football in the NFL. ... You look back and are like, 'Oh, do I have to change my preparation or tweak small things?' And that's ultimately what you do. It's just tweak really small things. And the bigger you try to fix issues and the bigger steps you try to take is usually when you start to fall back a little bit.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1223%2Fr1593102_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 20:02:55.359066

So there’s a good chance he’ll return to action on Sunday against the Bills in Buffalo after missing the last three games.

While Carter returned to practice on Tuesday inside the NovaCare Complex bubble, there was no sign of Lane Johnson (foot), who has missed the last five games. Landon Dickerson (calf) and Nakobe Dean (hamstring) were not practicing either but they were spectators.

Carter, 24, has missed the last three games after having a procedure in both shoulders after the loss to the Bears. In his absence, the other defensive tackles have played very well. But getting Carter back would be a welcome boost.

Even though he has played in 10 games this season, Carter was named to his second consecutive Pro Bowl this week.

Johnson, 35, has missed the last five games since suffering a Lisfranc sprain in his foot on Nov. 16. While veteran backup Fred Johnson played well over those five games — he gave up just 1 sack and 7 pressures — the Eagles have gone 2-3 without Johnson this season. And they would obviously love to have their future Hall of Famer back on the field.

Before the injury, Johnson was still playing at an extremely high level in 10 games this season. Johnson hasn’t surrendered a sack and has given up just seven pressures all season in 262 pass blocking reps.

Dickerson has been able to play through this calf injury but has missed time during the last few weeks as the Eagles try to give him rest. That will likely happen again this week.

If Dean can’t go on Sunday — and DC Vic Fangio called Dean “iffy” for this game — then rookie Jihaad Campbell would start next to Zack Baun. Campbell was a first-round pick in April and was the starter earlier this season before Dean returned from the PUP list.

Khyiris Tonga exited the Patriots’ game against the Baltimore Ravens in the second quarter. He was originally deemed questionable to return with a foot injury, but was eventually ruled out. According to NFL insider Ian Rapoport on Tuesday, Tonga has a “one-or two-week injury.”

Tonga has become an important player for the Patriots on both sides of the ball. He has started the last eight games at defensive tackle, but since Week 9, he has also been seeing snaps on offense.

Tonga is 6-foot-2, 335 lbs, and has served as the Patriots’ fullback recently. He is a big body and has been able to make an impact as a blocker. In Week 10, he was on the field for TreVeyon Henderson’s game-sealing 69-yard touchdown. He took out multiple defenders on the edge to spring Henderson free.

Tonga is important for the Patriots in all three phases. He also plays special teams. This season, he has logged 337 snaps on defense, 14 snaps on offense and 65 snaps on special teams. Mike Vrabel knows how impactful he is for the team, and getting him back before the playoffs would be great.

“That’s a guy that plays on three phases,” Vrabel said, via Doug Kyed of the Boston Herald, after the Patriots’ Week 10 win. “Helped us win defensively, helped us win offensively and then goes out there and stands in the way of three guys on the field goal protection unit.”

All things considered, getting Tonga back before the playoffs will be great for the Patriots. Losing him at all is a major loss, but at least the Patriots are expecting him back for the most important games of the season. He is not the only Patriot expected to return before the playoffs.

Let’s take a look at the injuries from this weekend and try to get ahead of the competition!

Let’s dive in.

NFL Week 17 Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens

Lamar exited their week 16 loss due to a back injury. He’s considered day-to-day, but the team is hopeful he plays Saturday.

Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills

Allen briefly left their week 16 matchup with a foot injury, but X-rays were clear. He’s considered day-to-day but expected to be good to go in week 17.

Jordan Love, Green Bay Packers

Love exited their loss to Chicago with a concussion. He will have to clear protocol to play this week, which seems unlikely.

Malik Willis, Green Bay Packers

Willis suffered a shoulder injury against Chicago. He will likely need to practice to get starter reps, as Jordan Love is unlikely to play, so this one will have to be watched closely.

J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings

McCarthy left his game this weekend with a hand injury and was an estimated DNP on Monday. He will likely need to return to practice this week to start this weekend, but I’m not holding my breath.

NFL Week 17 Injury Report: Running Backs

Quinshon Judkins, Cleveland Browns

With perhaps the biggest injury of the week, Judkins will miss the remainder of this season with a dislocated ankle and broken fibula. The rookie RB’s season ends, and muddles up the backfield for fantasy purposes.

Woody Marks, Houston Texans

Marks was ultimately inactive in week 16 due to an ankle injury. He was close to playing, so if he feels good in practice this week, I would expect him to play this weekend.

TreVeyon Henderson, New England Patriots

Henderson suffered a suspected concussion this weekend. At this stage, it’s just listed as a head injury, but if he enters concussion protocol, he is likely out this weekend.

NFL Week 17 Injury Report: Wide Receivers

Rome Odunze, Chicago Bears

Odunze missed the team's win against Green Bay. At this stage, given his injury and practice status, I would not expect him to be active this week.

Luther Burden, Chicago Bears

Burden wasn’t able to practice at the end of the week and was ultimately ruled out. He will likely need to log multiple practices this week to be active in week 17.

Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions

Amon-Ra suffered a knee injury in their week 16 loss and was an estimated DNP on Monday. I’m expecting him to be good-to-go this week, but I will monitor his updates and practice reports.

And if they want to be better at defending the run, they'll need their top defensive tackles on the field.

Fortunately, the Patriots got (mostly) good news on that front Tuesday.

Star defensive tackle Milton Williams, who missed the previous four games due to a high ankle sprain suffered in Week 11 against the New York Jets, is eligible to return from injured reserve this week. And while it's unclear whether he'll play in this Sunday's rematch with the Jets, the Patriots will open his 21-day window to return to action by having him practice Wednesday, head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed.

""He'll practice,"" Vrabel told reporters Tuesday. ""We'll start his window, see how he responds from the week of practice, and we'll go from there.""

Meanwhile, defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga, who suffered a foot injury in Sunday night's win over the Baltimore Ravens, is expected to miss one to two weeks but be ready for the playoffs, NFL Media's Ian Rapoport reported Tuesday.

MORE PATRIOTS COVERAGE

Along with fellow d-tackle Christian Barmore, Williams and Tonga lead a Patriots defensive front that was dominant against the run to start the season: New England's defense didn't allow a 50-yard rusher until Week 10 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and gave up just 679 rushing yards on 189 attempts (3.6 yards per carry) in its first nine games, by far the fewest in the NFL.

Since Williams went down on New York's opening drive in Week 11, however, the script has completely flipped: Including that Jets game, the Patriots have allowed 710 rushing yards on 148 carries (4.8 yards per attempt) over their last five games, which ranks 26th in the NFL.

With Tonga suffering a first-half injury and Williams already sidelined, the Ravens had their way with New England's depleted defensive front Sunday night, as Derrick Henry averaged a whopping 7.1 yards per carry (128 yards on 18 attempts) with two touchdowns.

The Patriots' struggles defending the run could continue this Sunday in New York if Williams doesn't return and Tonga remains out. But it sounds like both players should be back for the postseason, and if New England's run defense can return to its early-season form with Williams back on the field, it will make the 12-3 Patriots an even more dangerous team in January.",https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2025/11/Milton-Williams-USATSI_27370199.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-23 17:14:28.714440

Pelissero reported earlier Monday that Metcalf and the fan, whom The Detroit Free Press identified as Ryan Kennedy, have a history.
A source close to Metcalf told Pelissero that Kennedy on Sunday called Metcalf's mother a derogatory word and called Metcalf ""something we both know you don't call a Black man.""
The incident occurred during the Steelers' 29-24 win, but as Metcalf was not flagged for the incident, which took place off the field of play, he was not ejected.","Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf has been suspended two games without pay by the NFL for ""initiating a physical confrontation with a fan"" during Sunday’s game at the Detroit Lions, the league announced on Monday.

NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero reported that Metcalf plans to appeal the suspension, which is currently set to prevent him from playing in Pittsburgh's Week 17 game against the Cleveland Browns and its regular-season finale against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 18.

""Metcalf's actions violate league policy, which specifies that 'players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day and ... if a player makes unnecessary physical contact with a fan in any way that constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct or presents crowd-control issues and/or risk of injury, he will be held accountable,'"" the league said in a statement.

Video showed Metcalf approaching a male fan wearing a blue wig in the front row at Ford Field, grabbing him by the shirt and then swiping upward. It was unclear if Metcalf struck the fan.

Pelissero reported earlier Monday that Metcalf and the fan, whom The Detroit Free Press identified as Ryan Kennedy, have a history. Per Pelissero, Metcalf reported the same fan to Seahawks security last season when he played for Seattle (the Seahawks played at the Lions in Week 4 of the 2024 season and also played at Detroit in 2022 and 2023).

A source close to Metcalf told Pelissero that Kennedy on Sunday called Metcalf's mother a derogatory word and called Metcalf ""something we both know you don't call a Black man.""

On Monday, Kennedy issued a statement through an attorney that ""at no point before, during, or after the incident did Mr. Kennedy use racial slurs or hate speech of any kind.""

""Ryan Kennedy categorically denies using the 'N-word,' the 'C-word,' or any racial, misogynistic, or hate-based slur during the incident that occurred on Dec. 21, 2025 at Ford Field during the Pittsburgh Steelers-Detroit Lions game,"" the statement read, via ESPN. ""These allegations are completely false.""

Kennedy told the Free Press on Sunday that Metcalf was upset that he used his full legal name.

The incident occurred during the Steelers' 29-24 win, but as Metcalf was not flagged for the incident, which took place off the field of play, he was not ejected.

Metcalf finished the game with four receptions for 42 yards and has 59 catches for 850 yards and six touchdowns in his first year with the Steelers. Metcalf was acquired via trade this offseason from the Seattle Seahawks.

Since he was drafted by Seattle in the second round in 2019, Metcalf has a history of drawing unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike penalties. This year, Metcalf has been fined twice. In Week 13 he was fined $14,491 for an obscene gesture and in Week 8, he was fined $12,172 for ""striking/kicking/kneeing"" after he poked his finger in the facemask of Green Bay Packers linebacker Quay Walker with his left hand and then grabbed Walker's facemask with his right.

If the suspension is upheld, it could be costly for Metcalf. Based on his contract, the suspension would allow the Steelers, if they choose, to void not just the rest of his salary for this season but $45 million in future guarantees, $25 million fully guaranteed in 2026 and $20 million in a 2027 injury guarantee, per NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/mhjpxqsoppjvwkcb1x24,N,,2025-12-23 17:14:32.773425

Wisely, again so it seems, Khan did not overpay for a rental such as Jakobi Meyers at the trade deadline.
* The Steelers had 73 yards rushing, 221 yards total offense, and a puny time of possession of 22:25.
* But are these the two weeks of practice and full games that MVS and Thielen need with Rodgers?
* Let's hope that this is part of the unwinding process this offense still needs in order to finish its development.","From the notebook of a sportswriter who will utilize, in DK Metcalf, the drama that so many in the Steelers fan base need like oxygen to cope throughout a season:

* But I'm going to use it to make a case for the betterment of the team.

* I'm sure it's not a hard stretch for you to make even before I do, but here goes.

* This story didn't begin this year. I want to say it began with the Brandon Aiyuk drama last year when GM Omar Khan couldn't land a legit No. 2 wide receiver. And when he swapped out Metcalf for George Pickens to start the offseason, we assumed Khan had a plan in mind.

* But Khan didn't make the foolish mistake of passing on a much-needed foundational pick of a run-stuffing defensive tackle with pass-rush potential in the first round of the draft. By the time they skipped the No. 2 used to acquire Metcalf, the No. 3 pick may as well have been Roman Wilson, so Khan wisely, so it seemed, grabbed a faller at the deep RB position. Check back on Kaleb Johnson next season. Right now there are men at work.

* Anyway, the WR will come, we all told ourselves at that time.

* But he did not. Wisely, again so it seems, Khan did not overpay for a rental such as Jakobi Meyers at the trade deadline. This, after all, isn't a team that's overpaying draft capital for what outsiders wrongly viewed as ""All In!"" for this season. Instead, Khan can't wait to utilize his 12 picks next draft season to find his young QB and continue on a three-year build he and the refurbished personnel department have begun.

* Yeah, I know, Art Rooney II is ""running it back"" again and again in order to go 9-8 and pop the corks.

* What an idiotic assessment by radio talk shows. But, anyway, there the Steelers sat with one legit WR for an offense that really didn't have another scary skill player, other than Metcalf.

* Maybe it was the win over the overrated Colts that caused Khan to sit still on Election Day, the day of the NFL trading deadline. But up next was the Sunday nighter in Chargersland. The Steelers scored 10 points, 70 percent of which were scored in garbage time on a late 27-yard TD pass to the aforementioned Wilson.

* The Steelers had 73 yards rushing, 221 yards total offense, and a puny time of possession of 22:25. Pitiful.

* But maybe there was hope in Roman?

* There was not. The 34 points scored against a hapless Bengals defense the following week included two defensive TDs and the annual Mason Rudolph wizardry against the Bengals. Rudolph had replaced an injured Rodgers but it did not hide the fact there still wasn't anybody opposite Metcalf on what was clearly a crippled offense.

* But the Steelers did see big progress from a couple of pieces named Darnell Washington and Kenneth Gainwell.

* Against the Bears, the Diminutive Duo of Wilson and Calvin Austin combined for 36 receiving yards. All from Austin. And the stench of this offense was never more obvious.

* Until the following week against the Bills when the offense was even worse. Try these numbers on for size: 7 points, 58 yards rushing, 166 yards of total offense, and an even punier time of possession of 18:01.

* Someone's head must roll, and we heard from the paying customers whose head they wanted. After the game, when asked about the chants, Mike Tomlin did what he tells his players to do: He smiled in the face of adversity.

* It was taken by his haters as smugness. But I thought the pain behind the smile was obvious.

* The next week, with the help of a secondary that had been fixed by the move of Jalen Ramsey to free safety, the signing of Kyle Dugger, the improvement and replacement of James Pierre over Darius Slay, and the improving gap-sound play up front, the Steelers shocked the Ravens.

* It wasn't just the defense, of course. No, on this Pearl Harbor Day it was the 148-yard deep-ball performance by Metcalf and Rodgers. And not only did Rodgers show off his arm, he was allowed to show off his GM hat. Rodgers' boys, NFL rejects Marquez Valdes-Scantling and the recently picked up Adam Thielen, finally got to play over the smurf crew, the hope of the perpetual rebuilders, Wilson and Austin.

* Not that MVS and Thielen did much. But it was a much-needed start for a team that was seeing ancillary pieces such as the four tight ends and the two running backs contributing to help Metcalf.

* The next week against the Dolphins, MVS scored a TD.

* And this past week against the Lions, Thielen made three clutch conversions.

* Rodgers is finally beginning to look like Rodgers, and so much of that has to do with his options.

* Yes, this offense has options!

* And it's not only to Rodgers' team-building credit. It's due to Tomlin A.) allowing himself to be talked into strategic maneuvers by the best leader this team has had at QB since Bobby Layne, and B.) not playing the rebuilding game. It may piss off most writers, but playing the better player instead of the younger one keeps the locker room happy and moving toward a positive goal.

* When Tomlin was asked after the Miami game if his team was coming around, he did not unleash hell in December. Instead, he just said, ""Keep watching.""

* I don't for a minute believe Tomlin thought there were pieces to unveil that only he knew about. No. HE needed to keep watching. HE needed to keep his mind open. HE needed to realize this process is still unraveling. No, he didn't have any answers. Sometimes we see ourselves in the mirror, because when I don't have answers, particularly for readers demanding an IDENTITY on opening day, I've always said, ""Keep watching.""

* Sometimes that philosophy unravels in a heap of poor quarterbacking, offensive line play, and defensive secondaries that have had more to do with lost playoff games than has coaching. While most fans bitch about the lack of a playoff win in eight seasons, they never identify a team good enough to have won a playoff game. In my mind, there's always been a fear since about 2011 that the Steelers entering the playoffs were fraudulent.

* I don't have that fear this time, because this time they have a real quarterback. They have a young, developing, improving, offensive line. They have a defense that appears to have all of its holes patched. And they appear to have a real offensive coordinator who we've watched cobble something out of the bits and pieces of role players that are all coming together because they've all been nurtured.

* Are MVS and Thielen enough to beat the big boys though?

* That's the primary question as the Steelers sit here today on the cusp of a playoff berth. Can those two ""rejects"" actually catapult this into a real offense?

* Well, they're going to get their full run, thanks to the idiocy of WR1.

* No, Metcalf's shenanigans with a fan were not of the Pickens variety. He's an entirely different type of team sabotage. I like to think that Metcalf is a different kind of problem in that he cares TOO much, that he's TOO far inside his own head. But, yeah, dumb move in drawing a two-game suspension.

* But are these the two weeks of practice and full games that MVS and Thielen need with Rodgers?

* Let's hope that this is part of the unwinding process this offense still needs in order to finish its development. It could be. In fact, my optimism says that yes, the Universe -- allowed to unleash hell in December of its own volition -- wants to see Rodgers at his very best.

* We all do. We all want to see a truly great story unfold.

* Keep watching.",https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/543/509/13509543.jpg?width=1200&height=628&crop=1.91:1&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-23 16:14:10.356099

Neither is getting within a sniff of the postseason as Dallas has been betrayed routinely by their defense while last season’s Offensive Rookie of the Year, Jayden Daniels, has played in just seven games this season for Washington. Yes, there have been additional issues in our nation’s capital, but the absence of a healthy Daniels has been at the epicenter of the Commanders’ woes.

The situation under center has gotten even more desperate for Washington as both Daniels and his backup, Marcus Mariota, are now sidelined with injuries meaning journeyman Josh Johnson is in line to get the start. The 17-year veteran has attempted a mere 14 passes over the course of the last three seasons. That’s far more than Phillip Rivers has attempted the last three seasons, but its still not a lot.

The injury occurred on a third-and-long when Kittle was running a route across the field. The 32-year-old veteran pulled up after trying to make a cut and finished the play limping.

Kittle was able to get off the field under his own power. He went to the sideline and sat on the bench, where he was seen hunched over in apparent pain.

Kittle never went into the blue medical tent but was seen speaking to San Francisco's training staff on the sideline. The ESPN broadcast later captured Kittle trying to get loose and testing whether he could come out of his stance on the balky ankle.

George Kittle injury update

Kittle did not return to the 49ers' 48-27 win over the Colts after being deemed ""questionable"" to return because of an ankle injury. Despite this, the 49ers never officially ruled Kittle out.

49ers coach Kyle Shanahan acknowledged Kittle had been playing through the ankle injury before exiting Monday's contest.

""He played with it for a while, and just got too stiff,"" Shanahan told reporters during his postgame news conference. ""We'll find out more tomorrow.""

Kittle led the team with seven catches and 115 yards and scored a touchdown before exiting the game.

Who is George Kittle's backup?

Luke Farrell is listed as Kittle's top backup on the 49ers' depth chart. The five-year veteran is better known for his blocking and has recorded just 11 catches for 85 yards this season.

Farrell spent the first four seasons of his career before joining the 49ers as a free agent during the offseason.

""There are no signs that the Bengals are planning to make major changes,"" Pelissero said on ""The Insiders."" ""All indications are right now that Taylor should return. Burrow's injuries have been a driving force in the recent struggles. They were 1-8 without him this season. Bengals owner Mike Brown is a believer in Taylor, who has taken them to a Super Bowl.

Lamar Jackson - Low back contusion

Lamar took a vicious hit ot the lower back and had to leave a critical Week 16 game. Now the Ravens need to win and have Pittsburgh lose to make the playoffs. If Lamar gets in even one limited practice, I expect him to give it a go given the stakes, but he will be operating at an even lower mobility ceiling than before.

Projected Return: TBD

Allen was clearly in pain, and this is something to monitor, but with negative X-rays and no specific mechanism on video, we can assume the Winter Water Buffalo will be good with moderate volatility in Week 17.

Projected Return: Week 17

J.J. McCarthy - Hand

Negative X-rays make this injury perplexing. Given he wouldn’t have practiced Monday, it’s worse than a bone bruise. But no fracture doesn't mean there's no ligament damage. As of now, he’ll have to regain grip strength and drop pain to handle the ball. Plan to be without McCarthy.

Projected Return: Week 18+

Jordan Love - Concussion

There’s never a clear path to return after a concussion. Still, as a skeptical injury analyst of 5+ years, it would be surprising to see Jordan Love miss a must-win game unless his symptoms are undeniably bad.

That was until a Monday Night Football win for the 49ers over the Colts gave Arizona a slightly better strength of schedule (.576) compared to Tennessee (.573).

The Cardinals would draft sixth if picking after Week 16 play. They and the Titans are two of four teams with a 3-12 record at this point, and strength of schedule is the tiebreaker.

The Cardinals lost 26-19 against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, their seventh consecutive loss and 12th in the past 13 games. Arizona led 13-3 before the Falcons outscored the Cardinals 23-6 for the rest of the game.

Arizona visits the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams to end the season, a lame duck first game and possibly relevant finale, as the Rams jockey for playoff positioning in a juggernaut NFC.

This is a big week for the draft order, as the New York Giants visit the Las Vegas Raiders in a loser-likely-earns-the-top-pick showdown.

The Cleveland Browns host the Pittsburgh Steelers after playing the Buffalo Bills tough on Sunday (23-20 loss). Pittsburgh can win the AFC North with a victory.

The New York Jets have gotten blasted by 20-plus for three straight games and have the Patriots and Bills left on the schedule, so there are not many reasons to expect much help there.

And the Titans have won two of their last three games and play the suddenly frisky New Orleans Saints at home this week.

The Cardinals’ path to the top three appears to be to lose out and hope for a Browns win and either the Raiders or Giants to end the year with a couple of garbage-time wins over non-playoff teams.

What does the latest mock draft say?

Pro Football Focus released a new mock draft on Monday, projecting the Cardinals go with offensive tackle Spencer Fano out of Utah with the No. 5 pick. Quarterbacks Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore flew off the board with the top two picks.

Quarterback remains a huge question mark for the Cardinals, but they don’t get the opportunity to address it in this mock draft. Instead, they focus on finding a partner for left tackle Paris Johnson Jr. and go with Utah’s Spencer Fano, who earned an 83.7 PFF pass-blocking grade on true pass sets and PFF run-blocking grades above 75.0 on both zone and gap runs.",https://arizonasports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2253061545-e1766431059348.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 17:14:39.361506

Almost no player is healthy at this point in the season, but a few more concerning injuries were added to the list late in the year.

Many missed the week due to injury — including Patrick Mahomes, Alvin Kamara and Rashee Rice, to name a few — but many more joined the list in Week 16.

Depending on where teams stand in the playoff race, injuries tend to be season-ending at this point in the season. However, some still affected players' long-term futures and potentially threatened their availability for 2026.

With the season coming to a close, take a look at some of the biggest injuries from Week 16 of the 2025 NFL season.

Browns RB Quinshon Judkins (fibula, ankle)

Quinshon Judkins suffered the biggest injury of the week in the second quarter of the Cleveland Browns' matchup with the Buffalo Bills. Judkins was blown up on a screen pass by Bills linebacker Matt Milano and immediately showed visible signs of pain before being carted off the field.

It did not take long for the Browns to rule him out for the remainder of the game before eventually revealing the nature of his injuries. Judkins suffered a fractured fibula and a dislocated ankle on the play, sidelining him for the next four to five months.

Judkins' rookie season ends with 827 rushing yards, 171 receiving yards and seven touchdowns. He will likely miss 2026 mandatory minicamps, but he could return in time for OTAs and training camp.

Packers QB Jordan Love (head)

One week after losing Micah Parsons, the Green Bay Packers watched their quarterback go down. Jordan Love suffered a concussion early in the team's Week 16 rematch with the Chicago Bears and did not return for the rest of the game.

Backup quarterback Malik Willis also suffered minor injuries late, but the Packers are certainly more worried about Love. The team is listing him as week-to-week for now, putting his Week 17 status in doubt.

Concussion protocol is always tricky, but Love is almost guaranteed to miss Week 17. The 9-5 Packers remain in the playoff discussion but are now clinging for dear life after ceding control of the NFC North to the Bears. If Willis is unable to go, Green Bay could be forced to deploy Clayton Tune for its upcoming game against the Baltimore Ravens, who are also dealing with a quarterback injury.

Ravens QB Lamar Jackson (back)

Just when it seemed like the Baltimore Ravens were back on track, Lamar Jackson landed back on the injury report. Jackson exited the Ravens' Week 16 game against the New England Patriots with a back injury after getting hit from behind at the end of a run.

The team has since updated Jackson's status, saying he has a significant back contusion but no structural damage. Jackson is considered day-to-day, according to NFL insider Ian Rapoport, and will likely begin the week on the sidelines. He is questionable to play in Week 17 against the Packers, a game both teams absolutely need to keep their playoff hopes alive.

Tyler Huntley, who only threw for 65 passing yards in relief of Jackson, would earn his second start of the year if the two-time MVP is ruled out. Although Huntley looked out of sorts in Week 16, he is 1-0 on the year as a starter, leading the team to a 30-16 win over the Chicago Bears in Week 8.

Vikings QB J.J. McCarthy (hand)

The Minnesota Vikings are already eliminated from playoff contention, placing their main focus on evaluating J.J. McCarthy as a franchise quarterback for the remainder of the year. McCarthy put those plans on pause with his second injury of the 2025 NFL season in Week 16 against the New York Giants.

The second-year quarterback injured his hand on a strip sack from the Pro Bowl-bound Brian Burns in the second quarter. He appeared to hit his hand on a Giants player's helmet earlier in the game, but the fumble would be his final play of Week 16.

McCarthy had been on a roll before the injury and scored a rushing touchdown against the Giants prior to exiting. However, he is on the wrong side of questionable with the Vikings turning around quickly to face the Detroit Lions on Thursday night.

Patriots RB TreVeyon Henderson (head)

One week after posting a career-high 148 rushing yards, TreVeyon Henderson did a full 180-degree turn to record a career-low three rushing yards. On the same day he watched his former Ohio State teammate, Quinshon Judkins, go down with a gruesome broken leg, Henderson left with his own injury after just five carries.

Henderson suffered a concussion early in the game after slamming his head onto the turf at the end of a short run. Nothing seemed too significant at first, but Henderson would not return to the game, leaving Rhamondre Stevenson to close out the Sunday Night Football contest.

Henderson is now in concussion protocol, which could mark the end of his regular season. The Patriots have already cemented their spot in the playoffs and could opt to rest their star tailback over the next two weeks to prepare for their unprecedented Super Bowl run.

Commanders QB Marcus Mariota (hand, quad)

The Washington Commanders are already without Jayden Daniels for the rest of the 2025 NFL season and could now be without Marcus Mariota, who left the game early in Week 16. Mariota is dealing with multiple injuries, including a minor concussion, a hand laceration and a quad injury.

Mariota has already cleared concussion protocol, but his hand remains a significant issue. The Commanders closed out Week 16 with journeyman Josh Johnson under center in their 29-18 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

With Daniels already done for the year, Johnson could very well be in line for his first start of the year in Week 17. The Commanders had Jeff Driskel as their emergency third-string in Week 16 and currently have Sam Hartman on their practice squad.

Broncos WR Pat Bryant (head, neck)

Quinshon Judkins suffered the worst injury of Week 16, but another rookie was the victim of one of the scariest injury of the 2025 NFL season later that same day. After failing to catch an errant pass from Bo Nix, Pat Bryant took a massive shot from Jacksonville Jaguars cornerback Montaric Brown and remained down on the field for several minutes before getting stretchered off.

Brown did not make contact with Bryant's head, but the rookie's entire body folded over itself. The hit was entirely legal, but Brown was still rushed to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a concussion before being released late Sunday night.

Bryant has been a revelation for the Broncos in the second half of the year, accumulating 301 of his 347 receiving yards since Week 8. He has emerged as the team's No. 2 receiver behind Courtland Sutton, but he will almost certainly miss the rest of the regular season, and possibly the remainder of the year.

49ers TE George Kittle (ankle)

George Kittle is coming off his first 100-yard performance of the 2025 NFL season in Week 16, but it came at a price. The 32-year-old tight end left the game with a sprained ankle before returning in the second half, only to reaggravate it on a route and exit again.

Kittle said after the game that he believes he avoided a high-ankle sprain, which he claims came from an illegal hip-drop tackle. Head coach Kyle Shanahan said it is still “too early” to tell, leaving Kittle's Week 17 status in question.

The San Francisco 49ers are well above the playoff threshold, giving them reason to potentially be cautious with Kittle in the coming weeks. Fantasy football managers might want to look elsewhere if they are relying on the six-time Pro Bowler for the fantasy championships.",https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Jordan-Love-Quinshon-Judkins-and-more.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 15:14:13.242067

Despite back-to-back losses that included multiple injuries to key players including defensive end Micah Parsons and quarterback Jordan Love, the Green Bay Packers are on the brink of clinching an NFL playoff berth.

Thanks to the Pittsburgh Steelers' victory over the Detroit Lions, the Packers (9-5-1) need only a win or a loss by the Lions (8-7) to clinch a spot in the NFC postseason.

The Baltimore Ravens (7-8) visit Lambeau Field Saturday night, Dec. 27 with their own playoff hopes in dire straits. After losing to the New England Patriots Dec. 21, the Ravens need to beat both the Packers and the Steelers in their final two games and the Steelers (9-6) need to lose to the 3-12 Cleveland Browns.

Both teams are unsure which quarterback will start. Love remains in concussion protocol after being knocked out of the Dec. 20 loss to Chicago and was replaced by Malik Willis, who ended the game with a shoulder injury. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson left the Patriots game with a back injury and was replaced by Tyler Huntley.

The Lions play to the Minnesota Vikings on Dec. 25 so there's a chance the Packers will have secured a playoff spot by gametime.

Love remains in concussion protocol after a helmet-to-helmet hit in the second quarter of the loss to the Bears.

Willis sustained a shoulder injury after Bears defensive tackle Montez Sweat drove him to the ground on a sack with 17 seconds left in the fourth quarter. He remained in the game.

""Malik, I'd say he's pretty sore,"" LaFleur said Dec. 21. ""That's a legitimate deal he's dealing with. He's going to be another guy we'll see where he's at as we progress. That further complicates the other problem.""

If both quarterbacks are unable to play, the Packers may have to turn to practice-squad quarterback Clayton Tune.

George Kittle suffered a rough-looking ankle injury in the second quarter of the San Francisco 49ers’ win over the Indianapolis Colts during Monday Night Football.

The tight end left the game in the second quarter and didn’t return, though he remained on the sideline for much of the second half. His post-game comments suggested the injury wasn’t as serious as it first appeared.

George Kittle says his ankle injury doesn’t seem too serious

George Kittle spoke to reporters after the game, giving a clear account of the play that led to his exit. After sustaining the injury, Kittle tried to play through it before deciding it was best to come out.

As far as the seriousness of the injury, Kittle quelled concerns about his health, but did suggest that he needed to know the prognosis before making a larger statement.

“It happened [in the] second quarter. We had a drive. I feel like I got hip dropped. Ankle got stuck in the grass or the cork turf. Really weird field.

“I tried to tape it up, went in the third quarter, and it just got worse from there. If I can’t run very fast or plant, then I think it’s a better option for my other tight ends to go in there and make plays.

With their win over the Colts, the San Francisco 49ers moved to 11-4 for the season. They now sit behind the Seattle Seahawks, who are first in the NFC West.

MORE SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS STORIES

With their record, the 49ers are virtually set to reach the playoffs. And as such, they will be very concerned about Kittle’s injury.

If Kittle’s injury isn’t very serious, the 49ers should still exercise caution and not play him in their remaining games this season.

Bringing back Kittle healthy in the playoffs should be their top priority, as they will find it very difficult to mount a run to the Super Bowl without him.",https://cdn3.hitc.com/uploads/1/2025/12/GettyImages-2252613680-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 14:14:57.058277

Takeaways:

Trevor Lawrence is carrying fantasy teams to a title. He's been the fantasy QB1 in each of the last two weeks, scoring a whopping 75.46 points in that span. Lawrence has two or more touchdowns and no giveaways in four straight games, the longest such streak of his career. I'd continue to ride the hot hand this week with the Jaguars heading to Indianapolis, where the Colts will be looking to play spoiler.

After a majestic streak of nine consecutive games with at least 18 points, Jacoby Brissett's fiery run was finally extinguished by the Falcons. He was held to a season-low 10.62 points on Sunday, but I'm not ready to count him out for those of you streaming QBs. Brissett is a strong bounce-back candidate with a matchup against the Bengals' porous defense in Week 17.

Takeaways:

We didn't see a Michael Carter bump in Week 16, with the Cardinals giving him just 50% of the RB carries even though he started the game. It's going to be hard to trust him as a fantasy starter with that kind of volume, but if you're feeling desperate at the position, he does have a favorable matchup. Arizona will visit the Bengals, who have been the most generous defense to RBs this season.

There is a lot of uncertainty for the Packers' offense this week, with Jordan Love, Malik Willis and Josh Jacobs among the players dealing with injuries. If Jacobs doesn't play against the Ravens, Emanuel Wilson has RB2 value. If Jacobs plays, Wilson might still have flex value in deeper leagues, but he'll be a much tougher sell in that scenario. He led the team with 82 yards on 14 carries in Week 16, with Green Bay leaning on him after Jacobs' third-quarter fumble.

The Browns' backfield is one to watch in the days ahead, but it's not a position group to be particularly excited about, given its depleted state and the ho-hum status of the team's offense as a whole. With Quinshon Judkins suffering a fractured fibula and dislocated ankle on Sunday, Raheim Sanders ended up leading Cleveland RBs with 11 carries for 42 yards. Dylan Sampson figures to be at the top of the team's pecking order if he returns from his own injury to play against the Steelers in Week 17. I just hope you don't need to start a Browns back with a fantasy championship on the line.

Takeaways:

Parker Washington deserves a spot here after his career day in the Jaguars' massive win over the Broncos. He led the team with 10 targets, making six grabs for 145 yards and a TD. I'm just not sure we can bank on a repeat performance this week. Washington has scored 10-plus points in six of 14 games this season, but the outbursts have been sporadic. The way the red-hot Trevor Lawrence is rolling right now, though, I'd at least consider Washington as a flex in deeper leagues.

If I knew Kayshon Boutte were set to play this week, he'd be my Patriots receiver to target on the wire. However, with his status uncertain after leaving Sunday night's game due to a head injury, I'm turning to Mack Hollins, who has a team-high 17 targets in the last two weeks. Hollins made seven catches against the Ravens, and he should see his share of opportunities against a wilting Jets defense.

I know Luther Burden III missed Week 16 with an ankle injury and his status for this week is not yet clear. I still like his upside and matchup (at 49ers) enough to stash him if it looks like he has a chance to play. You would have the option to put him in your lineup (if you don't have a clear flex answer) or block your opponent from doing the same. Burden did post double-digit fantasy points in back-to-back games prior to suffering the injury.

Takeaways:

Taysom Hill went full Swiss Army knife mode against the Jets. He was the Saints' de facto RB1 on Sunday with Alvin Kamara and Devin Neal both sidelined. The ninth-year veteran led New Orleans with 12 carries for 42 yards, but he also threw a TD pass and caught four passes for 36 yards. He finished with a season-high 15.32 fantasy points. If you're looking for an upside play at tight end, it's tough to beat Hill right now, given his usage. The floor is low, though.

Yes, I'm mentioning another Jaguar. Brenton Strange ranks seventh among tight ends in receiving yards since returning from injury in Week 12 (230). He's averaged 10.4 fantasy PPG in that span. That's solid, if unspectacular, production at a position where solid can be hard to come by.

Navigating WRs amid QB injury chaos,KC Joyner,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6910791/2025/12/22/backup-qbs-fantasy-football-wr-outlook/,"Those historical trends can provide some guidance regarding whether these pass catchers can be trusted in fantasy lineups in Week 17.

There is already a notable decline in median WR scoring this season, and now even fewer wide receivers may be viable in fantasy lineups.

But some wide receivers are better at producing quality numbers with backup quarterbacks, so this week I looked at the wide receivers (and a couple of tight ends) who are dealing with a change at quarterback and detail how those players have produced in similar situations in previous seasons. Those historical trends can provide some guidance regarding whether these pass catchers can be trusted in fantasy lineups in Week 17. We’ll sort this by teams, starting with a club that plays in the early game on Christmas Day.

Unless otherwise mentioned, the statistics below are from TruMedia/PFF, NFL Next Gen Stats or Stathead; PPR scoring is used for point totals. Roster rates are in Yahoo leagues.

Washington Commanders

Terry McLaurin

McLaurin has been Mr. Consistency for a while, so it’s no surprise that he has fared well with multiple passers. He’s averaged 10+ fantasy points per game (FPPG) with nine different quarterbacks in his career, including Dwayne Haskins, Alex Smith, Taylor Heinicke, Sam Howell, Carson Wentz, Case Keenum, Kyle Allen and Jacoby Brissett. McLaurin can be considered a high-floor candidate in Week 17 if Marcus Mariota plays. If Josh Johnson ends up under center for Washington, McLaurin has high-floor status only in deep leagues.

Deebo Samuel

Samuel is similar to McLaurin in that Samuel has averaged 10+ FPPG with four different quarterbacks. Samuel can be considered another high-floor candidate if Mariota plays and a deep-league starter if Johnson is the Commanders quarterback in Week 17.

Minnesota Vikings

Justin Jefferson

His 14.5 points against the Giants in Week 16 will have many fantasy managers considering whether to start Jetta with backup Max Brosmer likely under center in Week 17. Jefferson has averaged 16+ FPPG with Kirk Cousins, Sam Darnold, Carson Wentz and Nick Mullens.

The downside is that Jefferson has averaged only 9.6 FPPG with McCarthy. That Jefferson hasn’t been able to continue his previous production pace in the McCarthy regime is a huge warning sign, even with the one-game reprieve. Sit Jefferson this week if you can, but you may not have that choice.

Jordan Addison

Addison is a near carbon copy of Jefferson, posting 10+ FPPG with three quarterbacks but setting a career low of 6.7 FPPG with McCarthy, making Addison another Week 17 sit suggestion.

Green Bay Packers

The Packers may be without Jordan Love following his concussion in the Week 16 loss at Chicago. Green Bay could also be without Malik Willis, who suffered a shoulder injury in that same game.

If those two are out, the Packers may go with Clayton Tune or use Josh Jacobs or Jayden Reed in an emergency role. In that case, no Green Bay wideout should be in starting lineups.

But if Love or Willis starts, here’s what the numbers say for Romeo Doubs and Christian Watson.

Romeo Doubs

Doubs has scored only 9.6 FPPG with Love, 7.5 with Aaron Rodgers and only 3.7 FPPG with Willis. Unless Love returns, Doubs shouldn’t be started.

Christian Watson

Watson’s case is similar to Doubs’. Watson has averaged 9.5 FPPG with Love, 8.9 with Rodgers and only 3.0 with Willis. There is low-end start value for Watson if Love plays, but if Love is out, Watson should be slated for bench duty.

Baltimore Ravens

Zay Flowers

Flowers has racked up 57.6 points over the past three weeks, but Lamar Jackson may miss time after being kneed in the back in the Sunday night game versus New England. Flowers’ track record suggests the quarterback change would be a massive downgrade for him. He’s averaged 12.0 FPPG with Jackson at quarterback, versus 7.2 with Cooper Rush and only 5.6 with Tyler Huntley. If Jackson plays, get Flowers into Week 17 lineups. If Jackson is out, Flowers needs to be out, too.

Mark Andrews

The historical numbers are on Andrews’ side. He’s averaged 11.2 FPPG with Jackson and 10.8 with Huntley. However, Andrews has been cold as ice of late, scoring 4.4 or fewer points in four of the past five weeks. He’s a sit candidate despite the strong track record with Huntley.

Miami Dolphins

Jaylen Waddle

Starting Waddle is a tough call following the Tua Tagovailoa benching. Waddle has averaged 14.1 FPPG with Tagovailoa. His highest FPPG average with other quarterbacks is 8.2 with Jacoby Brissett.

However, Waddle posted 12.2 points with Quinn Ewers under center in Week 16. The Dolphins also have a favorable pass-coverage matchup against Tampa Bay. Were it not for the Week 16 numbers, Waddle would be an easy sit choice. Since he did have one good game with Ewers, Waddle should be considered for a Week 17 flex spot in many leagues.

Indianapolis Colts

Michael Pittman

The good news for Pittman is that he has posted 12+ FPPG with four different quarterbacks (minimum of 80 targets), including Matt Ryan (14.6), Carson Wentz (13.5), Gardner Minshew (14.3) and Daniel Jones (12.8).

The bad news is that Pittman has played 14 games with Philip Rivers under center. He scored only 7.0 FPPG in those contests.

With that track record, it’s probably a good idea to bypass Pittman in Week 17’s matchup against Jacksonville. The caveat here is the Monday night game against San Francisco. If Pittman and Rivers connect well in that contest, then Pittman may be up for flex start consideration in the fantasy finale.

Kansas City Chiefs

Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy, Travis Kelce

Because Rice, Worthy and Kelce have had Patrick Mahomes at quarterback over the past eight seasons, I decided to go a different route with the Chiefs and see how Andy Reid’s offenses have produced in games without Mahomes.

Since 2018, the first year Mahomes was a full-time starter, Reid’s offenses have averaged 110 FPPG. In six games without Mahomes in that span, Reid’s offenses generate only 71 FPPG, a 35.5% drop. Sunday’s debacle against Tennessee was even worse. The Chiefs produced only 47 points in that game, though Rice was sidelined.

Reid’s play calling won’t be enough to warrant a fantasy start for any part of this trio in the Week 17 Christmas Day matchup against Denver. Apply the same logic to Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt for that contest.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/22092409/GettyImages-2234577512-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-23 12:07:09.969545

Aaron Ramsdale has deputised during his fellow England international’s absence, but Eddie Howe is hopeful that Pope will train ahead of the trip to Manchester United following a groin problem.

Tino Livramento, meanwhile, may return sooner than expected, albeit early in 2026 so he will miss the festive fixtures.

“There’s a chance,” Howe said of Pope. “He hasn’t trained yet, we hope he might (on Tuesday). Let’s see how he does.”

Livramento, meanwhile, was forced off during the second half of Newcastle’s Carabao Cup quarter-final victory over Fulham last Wednesday with a knee problem. Newcastle hope the 23-year-old has avoided a serious injury but are keen to get greater clarity before mentioning a timescale publicly for his return.

“We don’t actually. It’s a difficult one because there’s quite a bit of information on Tino,” Howe said. “We’re hoping to get full clarification. We’re hoping it’s not serious at all and he can resume training quite quickly but before we do that, we want to make sure that’s right.”

Sven Botman may return against Manchester United, Burnley next Tuesday or against Crystal Palace early in the new year having recovered from a back injury.

“Sven would be in the category of a group of (injured) players doing well,” Howe said. “We hope to get him back pretty soon. I’m not sure when yet, he hasn’t trained with the group yet, but he’s not too far away.”

Joelinton, meanwhile, has not featured since the 2-2 draw in Bayer Leverkusen earlier this month but has a chance of being involved against Manchester United, while Lewis Hall also came through against his former club Chelsea unscathed after a hamstring problem.

“I believe Lewis came through OK,” Howe said. “We’re still very aware that he’s had a little reaction to his hamstring but there is still part of us that will be nursing him through the upcoming games, we need to keep an eye on him.

“Joelinton is getting closer now to be able to participate. We’ll see how he trains today and how he looks.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/23044216/GettyImages-2245295241-scaled-e1766482966258.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-23 13:04:08.926151

The Big Thing: What went wrong for four teams trying to get into the playoffs?

Every week, this column will kick off with one wide look at a key game, player or trend from the previous slate of NFL action. What does it mean for the rest of the season? This week, we're looking at the four teams that are still alive for playoff spots but aren't currently occupying one of the 14 berths.

The 2025 playoffs are mostly full. The Panthers, Texans, Packers and Steelers currently hold the remaining open spots, with the Buccaneers, Lions, Colts and Ravens outside the field. All four of those squads still have a shot -- but to be on the outside looking in as we approach Week 17 is a sign that your season did not go as planned.

For some of this season's biggest disappointments, here's my view on what went wrong.

Detroit Lions (8-7, No. 8 in NFC)

As is often the case with would-be contenders, health is the first and greatest culprit. The Lions are second in the league with 267 total games missed for injury, via Sports Info Solutions, and injuries have compounded at key spots. Starting safeties Kerby Joseph and Brian Branch -- both Pro Bowlers -- are on injured reserve for the rest of the season, while starting cornerbacks Terrion Arnold and D.J. Reed have missed substantial stretches. No. 1 tight endSam LaPorta is out for the season because of a back injury, and backupBrock Wright is on injured reserve because of a trachea injury. It's one thing to catch the injury bug, but it's another thing when it's siloed in particular positions. That really exposes a team's depth.

At no spot on the roster have the Lions suffered attrition worse than the interior offensive line. Center Frank Ragnow retired and was replaced by Graham Glasgow, who was replaced at left guard by 2024 backup Christian Mahogany. Rookie second-rounder Tate Ratledge stepped in at right guard for Kevin Zeitler, who left in free agency. The Lions were going to be thin on the interior, but it was a risk an increasingly expensive roster would need to take.

It has backfired spectacularly. Four players have taken meaningful snaps at left guard this season, as Mahogany and primary backupKayode Awosikahave endured injuries that forced Trystan Colon and Miles Frazier onto the field. On Sunday against the Steelers, the Lions' third center (Kingsley Eguakun) started the first game of his career, as Glasgow, Colon and Awosika were not available.

Poor interior play has been a death knell for the Lions' offense. Quarterback Jared Goff, for all of his strengths and improvement over the years, remains a heavy-footed pocket manager who doesn't throw well from adjusted platforms. By quickly compromising Goff's throwing platform, the Steelers did not need to last for four or more seconds in coverage or successfully tackle running backJahmyr Gibbs on checkdowns. Goff took three sacks and had several more inaccurate passes, as the Steelers forced him to play without his feet under him.

The interior offensive line also limited the running game. The Lions ended Sunday with only 15 rushing yards, their fewest in any game since 2016; they had only 12 rushing attempts, their fewest in any game since 2012. Pittsburgh edge rushers Alex Highsmith and Jack Sawyer played extremely aggressively downhill, closing hard on interior runs and beating pullers to the point of attack.

When Detroit fails to control unblocked edge rushers, Goff's lack of mobility and inability to throw on the move can hamper the offense. Over the past six weeks, Goff has 13 dropbacks on designed rollouts (2.2 per game), with only five completions for 22 yards. Ideally, the coordinator of a team with liable interior pass protection can move the launch point for his quarterback -- but that button isn't available for head coach Dan Campbell.

Since Campbell took over playcalling, it's worth noting that the offense has clearly improved. We now have a seven-game sample of Campbell's playcalling relative to the eight games of coordinator John Morton prior to the switch, and the offense has generally moved the ball more reliably despite the Lions' record in Morton games (5-3) being superior to Campbell games (3-4).

This is where the defensive issues take over. With a healthy defensive backfield, the Lions' defense was as envisioned for the first half of the season. The Lions could play man coverage and challenge at the line, flopping from single high to split field with their two talented safeties. First-year defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard could dial up the blitz or lean off it against elite quarterbacks. They had real teeth: 1.93 points per drive allowed, 59% success rate and 0.02 EPA per play -- top-10 numbers across the board.

The Lions have cratered in the back half of the season, though. They've fallen from eighth in EPA per play to 28th and ninth in points per drive to 28th. Big plays are ripping through the depleted secondary at a 17.5% clip, second only to the Bengals for the highest rate in the NFL.

This is, of course, doubly frustrating because it's also the story of last season. Detroit had some defensive success early but limped into the postseason without Alim McNeill, Aidan Hutchinson, Marcus Davenport, Derrick Barnes, Carlton Davis III and Amik Robertson. Their divisional-round exit against the Commanders was swift and merciless.

Because injuries have played a key part in both the offensive and defensive stories in Detroit, it's tempting to wave away the entire season with gauze and bandages. But we should resist that temptation. That the Lions' depth was tested was a predictable and even inescapable reality of transitioning from the plucky upstart riddled with rookie contracts to an established contender with expensive veteran deals. The margins were always going to get thinner.

This season serves as a reminder of two key tenets of team building that the Lions must obey moving forward. The first is the importance of the interior pass protection for a quarterback such as Goff. Quicker and more explosive QBs can account for interior pressure, but Goff simply doesn't have the juice. It's easy to say now, but the Lions should have been more willing to miss out on the David Montgomery extension (or even, dare I say, the Taylor Decker extension, as his quality of play has diminished) to create more certainty along the interior. Ideally both left guard and center -- or at least one of those spots -- should get new starters in 2026, and that's while projecting some improvement from Ratledge at right guard.

Offensively, the Lions' playcalling is not an issue, but it's also not ideal. They experienced the expected drop-off of going from a truly elite playcaller (Ben Johnson) to an inexperienced one (Morton), and Campbell had to scramble midseason to stem the bleeding. I imagine Campbell will hire a new offensive playcaller this offseason and demote Morton to senior offensive assistant (what he was in 2022).

The larger tenet, however, is one Campbell has already spoken of but that we too easily forgot on the outside: It's hard to get back. Campbell famously told his team in the losing locker room of the NFC Championship Game at the end of the 2023 season that ""they may not be back here again."" It was a begrudging acknowledgment that success isn't repeatable in the NFL. In the hypercompetitive modern NFL, even Mount Rushmore quarterback Patrick Mahomes and historic head coach Andy Reid find themselves on the outside of the playoff picture looking in -- because they didn't innovate. They lost the cutting edge.

Detroit staved off its coordinator losses for years. Johnson and former defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn started interviewing for jobs after the 2022 season and didn't take one until after the 2024 season. The bill came due this season on the window that Campbell was somehow able to wrench open for multiple seasons. In not just Sheppard, the Lions' green defensive coordinator, but also in running backs coach Tashard Choice and linebackers coach Shaun Dion Hamilton, Campbell has gambled on young coaches and invested in their growth.

In 2021 and 2022, the Lions had time to develop their youth under the cover of no expectations. All of their mistakes and losses are in the sunlight now. Campbell is known as an elite developer, which alone is reason to buy stock in the 2026 Lions. But expectations force urgency and foster impatience. Once again, the margins are thinner.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8, No. 10 in NFC)

Here's a graph of Baker Mayfield's success rate in all of his career games. It's a 10-game rolling average, with his different games for different teams highlighted.

What is eerie to me about this graph is how much the Buccaneers' arc looks like the Browns' arc. After a little bit of rookie noise to start his career, Mayfield had a solid trajectory in Cleveland before getting banged up and seeing his play tail off. He was traded to Carolina, got released by the Panthers, did his stint in Los Angeles with the Rams then signed a small deal with Tampa Bay. We all know the story from there.

A prevailing and reasonable theory for Mayfield's deterioration in play this season is that he is playing through injury again. He suffered a sprain to his non-throwing shoulder against the Rams last month. But even before that, there was a weird three-week stretch in which he didn't scramble at all, and it feels like his accuracy has been scattershot all season.

But Mayfield's off-target rate this season is 16.8%, right around his career average (16.2%). The outlier season was actually last year when he had an 11.8% off-target rate -- easily the best of his career. His completion rate this season (61.6%) is right below his career average (63.3%), while last season's 71.4% rate was the best of his career by more than 7 percentage points.

I still think it's true that Mayfield is playing at less than 100 percent. But we so quickly change our opinion on quarterbacks year over year that an astonishing season like Mayfield's 2024 campaign quickly throws our perspective out of whack. This season isn't the surprising or inexplicable season. Last season was. It was the presence of a largely healthy offensive line and an elite schemer in Liam Coen that inflated Mayfield's play beyond what should reasonably be expected of him. (Don't worry, Jags fans. Trevor Lawrence is different.)

We can call this season a return to Earth for Mayfield while still acknowledging the extenuating circumstances. First-time offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard is still finding himself and what he believes on offense, as the Bucs' approach has vacillated between various identities to account for different players' availability. The absence of Bucky Irving has dramatically affected the Bucs' running game (0.05 EPA per rush this season vs. minus-0.04 last season) and their screen game (0.21 EPA per dropback last season, 0.02 EPA this season). The absence of wide receiver Mike Evans has dramatically affected their red zone touchdown rate (66.7% last season as compared with 54.5% this season). And of course, the lack of Coen affects all of this.

But still, Mayfield has not been good. He is back to highly erratic pocket play now that the Buccaneers' offensive line is less than elite. (Two backup guards will likely play the rest of the season.) His escapability is not nearly as good as he thinks it is, which leads to unnecessary sacks for large losses. And because he plays with such frenetic feet, he's liable to badly spray makeable passes.

Mayfield is still a solid starting quarterback, and his contract extension is very reasonable. He has been a problem for the Buccaneers this season -- but not their biggest one.

Coach Todd Bowles has struggled to figure out the Buccaneers' defense for an unacceptably long period of time. While there have been reasons for poor play in various pockets over the past few seasons, a good defensive coach should eventually get a stretch of good defensive play. Over the past three seasons, the Buccaneers are 22nd in defensive success rate and 22nd in defensive EPA per play. Eight of the 10 teams below them have seen at least a defensive coordinator switch, if not a head coaching change, in that time period.

Bowles' team philosophy is clearly reflected in how his defense has performed over this large sample. The Bucs are 26th in EPA per dropback faced but fifth in EPA per rush faced; they are 25th and fourth in the same pass/run split by success rate. Independent of player injury/matchup and team offensive performance, stopping the run at all costs has left the Buccaneers' pass defense liable.

Without an above-average defense over the past three seasons, it's difficult to figure out what Bowles is adding to the Buccaneers. By his own acknowledgment, the team had lost intensity and focus, and the Bucs needed to look in the mirror before the Panthers game in Week 16. They did yet lost that game. The Bucs are 30th in fourth-down decision EPA, ahead of only the Jets and the Titans. Bowles had an enormous hand in the Buccaneers' run-heavy offensive approach this week, and he probably has had that influence for a while. In five of the Bucs' past eight games, they've had run rates 10 percentage points over expectation, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Directionally and in execution, Bowles is not carrying the water a modern NFL coach needs to carry.

Tampa Bay has endured a gamut of injuries, especially on offense, and remains in striking distance of the NFC South crown so long as it wins its Week 17 game against the Dolphins (and Quinn Ewers). Then it's win-and-in versus the Panthers, a team the Bucs very well could have -- and should have -- beaten on the last drive this past week. Things are far from disastrous.

But disaster can be good, if it forces necessary philosophic or staff changes.

Indianapolis Colts (8-7, No. 8 in AFC)

What is there to say about the Colts? They were 8-2. Then, they lost five in a row. They were definitely good -- on a historic pace offensively. But quarterback Daniel Jones fractured his fibula in practice, and then popped his Achilles in a game. Philip Rivers then came out of retirement. And now the Colts are a feel-good story because they're getting close to winning, but not actually competing -- like a young team with a third-round rookie quarterback showing some pluck. From deeply serious to deeply unserious in one month.

Of course, there are layers. The cracks in the facade started to show long before Jones got hurt. As I wrote in Week 9, Jones' play under pressure had gone from historic QB1 numbers to league worst in a two-game stretch. An absurdly small sample ... but maybe a portend of things to come?

The Colts sure thought it was. I still don't understand the impetus, but after seven weeks with a pressure-to-sack rate of 7.1% (tippy-top elite number), Jones had three straight weeks with a pressure-to-sack rate of at least 27.8%. He quadrupled how often he took sacks.

Shane Steichen reasonably began bailing water out of the leaky boat, scuttling the Colts' empty-protection passing concepts and keeping way more players in the protection scheme. It helped, as Jones' sack rate fell way down, but his time to throw, as well as his accuracy, also fell precipitously. After a Week 11 bye, he posted a completion percentage 10.9% below expectation in Week 12 (worst of his season, per NFL Next Gen Stats) and then 7.9% below expectation in Week 13 (second worst of his season). In Week 14, he tore his Achilles.

As is often the case with average quarterbacks propped up by elite offensive environments, when things fall apart, they fall apart fast. The middle of Jones' season felt eerily similar to the end ofSam Darnold'sseason in 2024, when defenses found a button they could press to disrupt his game, and the house of cards crumbled around him. It's also reminiscent of Darnold's 2025 season -- Darnold's play has fallen off precipitously since his Week 11 game against the Rams, and even in his Week 16 revenge victory, he averaged minus-0.40 EPA per dropback.

An awkward reality of NFL player performance is that we want our average players -- the 19th-best quarterback, 14th-best offensive tackle and 17th-best kicker -- to have average games. But they don't. They have spectacular games and then terrible ones. They are average in the aggregate, but their individual performances are volatile, and in the case of some players, highly volatile. When Jones was at his peak with the Colts' offense, there was an inevitable regression to the mean on the horizon. The only question would be the steepness of the fall.

We can't really answer that question, as he got hurt before we saw his and Steichen's final efforts to escape the tailspin. And unlike Darnold, who is supported through his ups and downs by a truly terrorizing defense, the Colts' lone engine was their offense.

This is really what you have to shrug your shoulders at. The Colts understandably pushed their chips to the middle with the Sauce Gardner trade and got handed about the worst possible runout. CB2 Charvarius Ward suffered his third concussion of the season, leaving the Colts with coverage liabilities even when Gardner was healthy; Gardner strained his calf and hasn't played in three games; star defensive tackle DeForest Buckner returned from a Week 9 neck injury in Monday's loss to the 49ers. Too little, too late.

The theory behind the Gardner trade was sound. He's a field-altering player who would unlock their defense's ability to play man coverage and create turnovers in zone coverage. When Jones' struggles occurred, the defense was expected to do its part to mitigate the damage. But Gardner got hurt, Jones got hurt, and the other star defensive players who could have been difference-makers during this five-game losing streak got hurt, too. That's just how the cookie crumbles sometimes.

Of all these teams, the Colts' in-season lessons are the least interesting. It's fair to call the Gardner trade reckless, but anyone claiming the Colts' trade for Gardner was indefensibly aggressive is benefiting far too greatly from hindsight. The AFC playoff field turned out to be wide open, without the Chiefs and likely without the Ravens, too. This was a reasonable swing.

The Colts' offseason will be the most interesting to observe. How they manage their quarterback contracts will be as fascinating an offseason question as I can remember. Jones is a rising free agent andAnthony Richardson Sr. is approaching the fourth year of his rookie deal before the fifth-year option. The Colts must roster two potential starting quarterbacks for this upcoming offseason, as they did last year. Jones should be one -- but on what sort of deal? Can the Colts make anything larger than a one-year commitment to a player who likely won't be available for Week 1? And do they feel good enough about Richardson as the backup who might need to start four ... six ... eight games?

Beyond the quarterback question, the Colts have only two edge rushers under contract in 2026 and desperately need juice at the position. There is only one linebacker under contract in 2026, and Indianapolis needs coverage ability at that position. The Colts started investing in an impactful defense with the Gardner trade and the signings of Cam Bynum and Ward. Will Colts general manager Chris Ballard be willing to double down, or will he wave the white flag on reconstructing the defense?

Great February/March team. As for the rest of the season ... let's just enjoy the Rivers news conferences.

Baltimore Ravens (7-8, No. 9 in AFC)

The story of what went wrong with the Ravens has some notable similarities to the Lions' story. While Detroit had a lot of injuries, the Ravens suffered specific, major injuries. Star defensive tackle Nnamdi Madubuike was lost for the season to a neck injury. And star quarterback and two-time MVP Lamar Jackson missed three games because of a hamstring injury and hasn't been the same player since returning, with his athleticism clearly sapped and rushing ability accordingly hampered.

Beyond the Jackson injury, the major issue on offense this season has been the play of the Ravens' offensive line. Baltimore bet on internal development with 2022 fourth-rounder Daniel Faalele and 2023 seventh-rounder Andrew Vorhees at guard and has gotten below-average return on its investment. Even 2024 second-round right tackle Roger Rosengarten has been only an average starter. The talent drain along the offensive line over the past two seasons -- Morgan Moses, John Simpson, Kevin Zeitler, Patrick Mekari -- has finally caught up to Baltimore now that Jackson can't solve problems as easily with his legs.

But beyond the line, it's important to have an honest conversation about the Ravens' supporting cast of skill players. It is not very good. As I wrote a few weeks ago when assessing panic levels of teams on the bubble, there isn't a feared pass catcher on the Ravens' offense. You don't have to game plan for Zay Flowers, even if he is productive on screens and deep-breaking routes. He's not a tackle breaker and doesn't make spectacular catches. And as we've regularly seen in end-of-game situations, he makes critical mistakes -- drops, failed first downs with bad decisions and, of course, fumbles. That's how the Ravens' comeback hopes ended against the Patriots on Sunday night.

The Ravens' commitment to philosophy of draft, develop and extend is admirable and has generally served them well. But even the best drafting teams go through lulls, and without free agency to buttress the roster, the talent pipeline can dry up quickly. The only Ravens who were acquired via traditional free agency are running backDerrick Henry, receiverDeAndre Hopkins, offensive tackleJoseph Noteboom, quarterbackCooper Rush, defensive endBrent Urban, defensive tackleJohn Jenkins, cornerbackChidobe Awuzie and linebackerJake Hummel. Henry is already on a restructured dealafter his breakout 2024 season, and his $8.5 million cap hit represents 43% of the total cap the Ravens are spending on outside free agents this season. He's the only one with a cap hit above $2.01 million.

Of course, the Ravens successfully acquire talent from other teams via trade. Linebacker Roquan Smith, safety Alohi Gilman and edge rusher Dre'Mont Jones are recent trade acquisitions that have worked well. And they aren't without their draft successes. Safety Kyle Hamilton got his deserved massive extension, and center Tyler Linderbaum, a fellow first-rounder, is next in line. But did 30-year-old tight endMark Andrews need a new deal in his worst season as a receiver by per-route production? Did the Ravens need to beat the wide receiver market so aggressively this offseason in extending Rashod Bateman before his worst season in per-route production?

Remember, this was an issue before Henry originally signed in the 2024 offseason. The 2023 Ravens were the AFC's No. 1 seed and made it to the conference championship game but lost to the Chiefs in large part because they couldn't hand the ball off. A rotating backfield cast of Gus Edwards, Justice Hill and Keaton Mitchell had some utility, but it lacked a truly dangerous player. The same concern now stares down the Ravens' receivers and tight ends, as they might lose Isaiah Likely in free agency while the Flowers/Bateman/Andrews core is two years older. Yes, they're all handy players who deserve spots on NFL rosters. But they aren't playoff-caliber, field-tipping, game-altering, math-changing players.

Of all the Ravens' draft misses, they've been hurt the most at pass rusher. Baltimore has spent a significant pick on an edge rusher in five consecutive drafts: Mike Green (2025 second-round pick),Adisa Isaac(2024 third-rounder), Tavius Robinson (2023 fourth-rounder), David Ojabo (2022 second-rounder) and Odafe Oweh (2021 first-rounder).

Robinson, along with Jones, has ousted Green from a primary spot in the starting lineup, though Green gets some run. Ojabo is exclusively depth, and Isaac is out because of an elbow injury sustained in the preseason. Oweh was just traded to the Chargers in the Gilman trade and has a 16% pressure rate and 3.9% sack rate on 181 pass rushes in Los Angeles -- better numbers than any individual season of his Ravens tenure.

Oweh was the most successful pass rusher of the bunch. By pressure rate, the next best season belongs to 2024 Ojabo at 8.9%; by sacks, Green's 2025 is tied for the lead with 3.5. Baltimore has gotten plenty from drafted defensive tackles such as Madubuike and Travis Jones (hey, there's another extension!), but it has gotten next to nothing from its drafted edge rushers, especially now that Oweh is gone.

The Ravens' defensive system isn't predicated on a dominant four-man rush, of course. And per usual, their defense has steered through a tumultuous first half of the season to rock steady numbers in the second half. If Madubuike can come back healthy next season, the Ravens have most of their defensive core intact and under contract -- they just need an edge rusher (or two, or three).

So there's reason to expect the defense to continue excelling next season and for the offense to immediately elevate when Jackson returns to health. You could see that through the cracks in the first half against the Patriots. The defense got stops against one of the league's best offenses. Jackson looked spry, and the passing game finally looked explosive again. Henry had one of his best games of the season, posting a 66.7% success rate on the ground and the fastest average speed (13.81 mph) on rushes in a game this season, per NFL Next Gen Stats. Had the Ravens finished the job, it would have been a statement win for a team clawing its way back into postseason relevance.

Instead, Jackson went down with another injury. Tyler Huntley stepped in admirably, but with Henry sidelined (rather peculiarly) for a potential game-salting drive, the Ravens surrendered their 11-point lead and added another notch on the battered post of games they should have won but oddly lost. Had Jackson been healthy, it likely would have ended differently.

True of the game Sunday night. True of the season, too.

Second Take: Ben Johnson is Coach of the Year

ESPN's ""First Take"" is known for, well, providing the first take on things -- the instant reactions. Second Take is not a place for instant reactions but rather where I'll let the dust settle before taking perhaps a bit of a contrarian view.

I can very easily build a case that the Bears are fake good.

Take Saturday's win over the Packers. The winning play -- a 47-yard javelin from Caleb Williams to DJ Moore -- was spectacular. Perhaps the best throw any quarterback has made this season. To get there, we needed the Bears to cover a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit -- one that had been largely built and maintained by Packers backup quarterback Malik Willis, as starter Jordan Love left in the second quarter because of a concussion.

Here's how the Bears bridged the gap. They converted a third-and-20 thanks to a defensive facemask on a sack of Williams, then had to kick the early field goal (which they failed to get off before the two-minute warning), which was not a gimme considering the wind. Then they recovered an onside kick, which historically happens about 5% of the time. They scored a fourth-and-goal touchdown by throwing to a receiver who hadn't caught a pass in the NFL before this game. Finally, they got a fourth-down stop in overtime on a botched Green Bay snap and then hit their winning touchdown.

There were some high-quality plays I skipped over, of course. But you don't win a game in which you once had a 0.5% win probability without getting a little lucky along the way.

The Bears have gotten ""a little lucky"" a lot this season. They beat the Commanders in Week 6 after Jayden Daniels and Jacory Croskey-Merritt fumbled an exchange on third-and-1 with three minutes remaining. They beat the Raiders in Week 4 on a game-ending blocked field goal and the Vikings in Week 11 with a 56-yard kickoff return with 50 seconds left and the Bengals in Week 9 on a sick Colston Loveland catch that wasn't so lucky ... but the Bengals' poor tackling was. Those plays take skill, but if there's a lesson to be learned from the 2024 and 2025 Chiefs, it's that being good at winning close games is awesome ... until it very suddenly, and very brutally, isn't.

The Bears have now won six games in which they trailed in the final two minutes, which is the most such wins for any team since the 1970 merger, per ESPN Research. They are 6-4 when they've had a win probability of 20% or worse at any point of a game. Teams are not supposed to win 60% of games in which they have a 20% chance to win. That, quite literally, is not how percentages work.

This is the argument that the Bears are fake good, that their record overestimates their overall strength. But it's simultaneously an argument for Ben Johnson to win Coach of the Year.

These end-of-game performances have been the product of unbelievable adjustments and execution. Take, again, the final play against the Packers, that deep touchdown to Moore. This was a play that was put in during the week, as Williams told reporters after the game. ""I was watching film in [ Johnson's ] office and we just kind of went over small details throughout the play, and the next day we came out and discussed it and hit it in practice.""

Moore had a similar sentiment in his immediate postgame interview: ""We've worked on it in practice. I seen the look. Nobody back deep. I just got to run my ass off. You know, catch the ball for Caleb.""

It took time for Moore to get downfield -- tough to ""run your ass off"" in the fifth quarter of a short-week game. Loveland is technically first in the progression here, with Moore only live if there's no safety in center field -- or as Moore said, nobody back deep. In order to buy the time for Williams to make this throw, tight end Cole Kmet must block Green Bay linebacker Isaiah McDuffie one-on-one to the top of the screen, and fellow tight end Durham Smythe has to find blitzing linebacker Quay Walker through the C-gap and get enough of him.

This was only the third play-action pass the Bears completed Saturday -- a surprise, considering their offense was leading the league in play-action rate entering the game. In the first three quarters, the Bears called only four play-action passes: three attempts, one completion, 3 yards. In the fourth quarter and overtime, the Bears had four attempts, two completions and 68 yards.

I'm not sure what it is about Johnson and the Bears' offensive coaching staff, but they find solutions late. This play was a solution to their play-action woes of the week. Green Bay was hassling Williams on his play-action dropbacks and rollouts, so Johnson kept him in the pocket and max protected, catching the Packers' secondary playing aggressively in anticipation of quick pressure from their rush.

This is not an aberration. When filtering out garbage time, the Bears' offense goes from 5.3 yards per play in the first half to 6.1 in the second half -- the fifth-biggest delta in the league. By success rate, it is a leap of 5.7 percentage points (fourth biggest). By EPA per play, it's a jump of 0.11 expected points (second biggest). ""There's always an answer with this offensive staff,"" Smythe said, and he's right. No offense adjusts better than Johnson's unit.

After adjustment comes execution. Consider the context here. The Bears are on the fringe of field goal range in an overtime situation in which a field goal wins the game. Williams drops back and sees Loveland breaking across the cornerback's face -- remember, the tight end is his first read, and it's a throwable ball. A completion here sets up a makeable but long field goal in the wind.

But that's not what the Bears practiced. If the coverage is low, they're throwing the one-on-one. Come hell or high water, come only two play-action completions, come no offensive touchdowns for the first 59 minutes of regulation, this is how the play is executed. ""It's got a lot to do with ... Ben being on our ass every time,"" Moore said postgame of all the Bears' unlikely wins. ""We don't want to go into Mondays or any day with a loss to watch the film.""

This astonishing Bears season is undeniably the product of Johnson's rigor. Recall all of the offseason reports and September musings that Williams would struggle to fit in the offense and struggle to play with the timing that Jared Goff did. Recall the training camp reports that the offense couldn't move the ball because the motions were too complex, the pre-snap operation too onerous.

Moore has been one of the most open Bears players in speaking about Johnson's intensity. ""What's hard about it is that you've really got to be in your playbook and know every last detail of that playbook like he [ does ] ,"" Moore said in August. ""If not, you're going to get either the evil eye or get yelled at to get in the right spot.""

But when asked what he liked about the offense, Moore was clear back then: ""It's going to get us where we want to go."" Look at how right he was.

The promise of Johnson was as high as any first-time head coaching hire, and he has delivered on those expectations. Chicago is fourth in fourth-down decision EPA -- Johnson is making the right decisions -- even if they're 28th in actual fourth-down results. Johnson is nails on timeout management: He took his first against the Packers with 6:30 remaining in the fourth quarter, when it became clear the Bears would need two drives to tie the game. He has onboarded rookies into his complex offense as the season has gone on; Loveland, receiverLuther Burden III, offensive tackleOzzy Trapilo and running backKyle Monangaihave been more involved and more productive in the second half of the season.

Where would Chicago be without Johnson's radical cultural shift? Could this team have so easily shed the stink of last season's collapse without a coach so uniquely willing to adjust and grow? Johnson's turnaround reminds me so much of what Dan Campbell did with the Lions -- with one major difference. It's happening even faster.

So let me posit a new argument. The Bears are a second-half team in every sense of the term. Second half of the game, second half of the season. No team has grown more or adjusted better than the Bears. And for as silly as the early-season victories over the Raiders and Commanders were ... they happened. They helped put the Bears on the verge of getting a home playoff game (or two). But the closeness of those games is no longer disqualifying for these second-half Bears, who have changed as much as a team can between October and December. Aaron Schatz shared it on social media just this week: The Bears are 16th in DVOA, but in weighted DVOA, which prefers recent games, they're 10th. The arrow is rocketing up.

The Bears have a supremely talented quarterback on his way to breaking into the league's top 10. They also have an elite head coach. If Sean McVay and Kyle Shanahan are the NFL's two best head coaches, how is Johnson not in conversation with Mike Macdonald, Sean Payton and DeMeco Ryans for third?

Chicago's roster is far from perfect, and its luck will eventually swing the other way. But if the Bears are bringing a fringe top-10 quarterback and fringe top-three head coach into the playoffs, how do you not fear them?

From y'all

The best part of writing this column is hearing from all of you. Hit me on X (@BenjaminSolak) or by email (benjamin.solak@espn.com) anytime -- but especially on Monday each week -- to ask a question and potentially get it answered here.

From Marc:""Since the NFL merger, no quarterback has ever led the league in passing yards, touchdowns, had single digit interceptions, won at least 10 games and not won the MVP award. You have him third in your rankings. Can you please go into some detail as to why you feel Stafford shouldn't be the first?""

For clarity, I tweeted my hypothetical MVP rankings after Week 16, and had Drake Mayeat 1, Justin Herbertat 2 and Matthew Stafford at 3. (If that Herbert ranking surprises you, scroll down.)

I think MVP qualification and résumé comparison has gotten entirely out of hand. When I try to figure out who I think has been the league MVP of a given season, I have absolutely no interest in historical MVP trends. Just as easily as Marc says no quarterback has led the league in these categories and lost the award, I can say only two quarterbacks have ever lost their division and won the award. Stafford is an exception through one filter and a no-brainer through the other.

This is where the strength-of-schedule thing also drives me nuts. Maye shouldn't be the MVP because his opponents were bad? Do we not have eyes? I'm watching a quarterback in impeccable command of a complex offense distribute the ball and draw the best out of a cadre of solid but unspectacular receivers behind a below-average offensive line. That's value. This isn't the SEC. I don't give a hoot about cupcakes.

Stafford is unquestionably worthy of being the MVP this season. I'm splitting hairs between him, Maye and Herbert, and the hair is how good the rest of the Rams are relative to the casts of the Patriots and Chargers. Of course, we have plenty of ball left. Herbert has two extremely loseable games upcoming; Maye and Stafford ... probably don't.

MVP is and should be a subjective award. If we just hand it to the quarterback with the most yardage or touchdowns or passing EPA every year, we're fools. Just last season we had our first split MVP/first-team All-Pro ballot between Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson. Voters vote, and trust in the wisdom of that informed panel.

From Jack:""Should the Giants draft Fernando Mendoza?""

Yes.

From Hussle Westbrook:""What coach archetype should Baltimore look for if this is finally it for Harbaugh?""

I'd go for a Super Bowl-winning CEO type who regularly makes strong fourth-down and game management decisions. Someone with a proven recent track record of success with a mobile quarterback, too -- something like five divisional-round appearances in the past eight years.

(I am describing John Harbaugh.)

From Cody:""What does Dan Campbell going 1-for-3 on his hiring of OCs tell us about even the best of CEO-style head coaches and what effect might that have on future hiring cycles? Outside of hiring any of McVay's buddies, why is it so hard to predict who will be a good playcaller?""

This is the same question as the franchise quarterback question. The first and biggest issue is simple: There are fewer than 32 of these coaches at any given time. The 32nd-best offensive playcaller in football is incredible at his job and yet is still leaps and bounds below the utmost echelon -- the rarefied air of the truly elite. You're always going to get more offensive coordinator hires wrong than you do right simply because you're picking from the second crop of playcallers (the first crop are already head coaches), and there aren't that many coaches in the first crop, anyway.

Specifically to the McVay point: There is a survivor bias there. Without question, the Sean McVay/Kyle Shanahan tree is the most prolific for offensive playcallers. But is the success rate really as good as you recall? Liam Coen, Matt LaFleur and Zac Taylor are all hits ... but how were the Shane Waldron offenses? How is the Zac Robinson offense doing in Atlanta? How about Mike LaFleur's stretch with the Jets? Shanahan has spawned Mike McDaniel and Klint Kubiak, but his staff has trickled down into Nathaniel Hackett, Luke Getsy and Bobby Slowik.

There is no sure thing in offensive playcalling, just as there's no sure thing in first-round draft picks, season-over-season stability and pretty much everything else in the NFL. We're all guessing at everything.

Next Ben Stats

NFL Next Gen Stats are unique and insightful nuggets of data that are gleaned from tracking chips and massive databases. Next Ben Stats are usually numbers I made up. Both are below.

plus-23.9: That's Justin Herbert's total dropback EPA generated against the Cowboys on Sunday. It's the most EPA generated by a QB in a game this season, and the second most of a game in Herbert's career.

Put another way: Of the 34 points the Chargers scored, Herbert was the primary agent of 24 of them.

Of course, we should take all games against the Cowboys' defense with a boulder of salt. But my heavens was Herbert on fire against Dallas. Against pressure: 9-for-11, 108 yards and a touchdown -- no sacks, two scrambles. Against the blitz: 12-for-16, 143 yards, 11 first downs, one touchdown and, again, no sacks. He attacked every level of the field, too: 16-for-18 throwing within 10 yards of the line of scrimmage, and 8-for-10 throwing at least 10 yards downfield. Both of his touchdown throws were 20-plus yards downfield. This is the sort of game we thought elite quarterbacks would have forever, before defenses caught up.

The Chargers had their bye week in Week 12, having just lost a brutal and embarrassing game to the Jaguars. It was their second game without Joe Alt and first game with trade acquisition Trevor Penning starting at left tackle. It would be the only game Penning played at left tackle for the Chargers this season -- that's how bad the film was. Herbert was pressured on 52.2% of his dropbacks and had 81 total passing yards.

Since the bye, Herbert has singlehandedly decided the offense will be immune to the play of its offensive line. In the four post-bye games, Herbert has been pressured on 47% of his dropbacks -- the league-leading rate by an enormous margin -- yet is ninth in EPA per pressured dropback in the same stretch. He's eighth in success rate. He's first -- first! -- in yards per pass attempt.

Herbert's scramble rate on pressured dropbacks is 19%, as he has a faster eject button in the pocket .While he has been sacked 14 times, his pressure-to-sack rate of 22.2% is just above league average (18.1%). This is all him, too. Greg Roman and the Chargers' offensive coaching staff have shown no recourse for minimizing the omnipotent pressure, and given how poor their offensive line talent is across the board, there's not much they could do. The running game isn't a salve, either. In the same four-week stretch, the Chargers have 4.2 yards per carry and a success rate of 38.3% on designed runs -- both below league average.

It is not difficult to build a Herbert MVP case. I have no doubt the Chargers' offense would be remarkably worse if the presumed MVP -- Rams QB Matthew Stafford -- were swapped into this offense in place of Herbert. Stafford lacks the mobility necessary to make these pockets viable, and while he'd attempt passes as aggressively as Herbert, he'd be enduring a substantial downgrade in wide receiver quality.

The Chargers are in striking distance of the AFC West crown, as a win against the Texans in Week 17 would guarantee that their Week 18 contest against the Broncos would be for the title. Of course, the Broncos and Texans have perhaps the two scariest pass rushes in the league. The Texans, in particular, terrorized Herbert in the AFC wild-card round last season, holding him to 14-for-32 passing for 242 yards and four interceptions while sacking him four times. This is a familiar foe for the Chargers' offense, and one against which they match up terribly.

It's unlikely Herbert can sustain this level of pressured play against this sheer quantity of pressure -- the numbers are too steep. It's more likely that the combined games against the Texans and Broncos break him -- he's already getting hit more than any quarterback in the league. But if he can endure, the Chargers will win the AFC West, and I will be hard pressed to find a more impressive -- or valuable -- player in football.

1: That's how many times Pat Surtain II was targeted in coverage against the Jaguars out of 43 coverage snaps

Conversely, out of 42 coverage snaps, Riley Moss was targeted 12 times (eight catches for 92 yards). Safety P.J. Lockewas targeted seven times in 42 coverage snaps (four catches for 33 yards and a score). And in 24 coverage snaps, nickel Ja'Quan McMillian was targeted another four times (four catches for 41 yards and a score).

To be clear, these aren't straight man coverage reps. In fact, the Broncos played a lot of zone coverage in an attempt to close intermediate windows and force Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence to hold on to the football, allowing their pass rush to get home.

The issue is that you can still generally avoid Surtain even in zone, because you know where he'll line up. Surtain followed Brian Thomas Jr. for most of the game, but the Jaguars have become a spread-the-wealth passing attack during their late-season emergence. Parker Washington (six catches, 145 yards), Jakobi Meyers (four catches, 45 yards) and Brenton Strange (five catches, 39 yards) carried the load while Thomas (two catches, 18 yards) ran Surtain out of impact.

The Broncos' secondary is still great overall. McMillian is an above-average nickel; Moss is a solid CB2. But in the postseason, more offenses will be equipped with the necessary pass-catcher depth to relegate Surtain to an actionless island. The Jaguars did it Sunday. What about the Patriots, with their rotating cast of wide receivers? Or the Bills, who don't even throw to their receivers anyway?

1.23: That's Shedeur Sanders' EPA per dropback on screen passes this season. It's the highest number of any season in the Next Gen Stats database

Raw stats: 11-for-16 for 210 yards, six first downs and a touchdown. Sanders averages 13.1 yards per pass attempt on screens, which is more than double the league average (5.6) over the past decade. Somehow, Sanders has a completion percentage 8.0% under expectation on screens, which is 406th out of 437 quarterbacks in this sample -- so there's even room for improvement! The screen game could be better!

But what Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski and offensive coordinator Tommy Rees have done to create yards after catch and explosive opportunities despite having a fifth-round rookie quarterback playing behind an offensive line with bottom-tier tackle play is quite something. Cleveland's coaching staff is drawing blood from a stone in its passing game right now, and every game in which the offense hangs is a testament to that effort.

1. Seattle Seahawks (12-3)

Week 16 result: Beat the Rams 38-37 (OT)

Week 16 ranking: 2

Rookie of the year: Left guard Grey Zabel

Zabel was the Seahawks' highest-rated interior offensive lineman prospect, and the 18th pick has shown why. He ranks first among all guards in run block win rate while starting all 15 games. This distinction could just as easily go to second-round pick Nick Emmanwori, who has the third-best odds for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year (+750 at DraftKings) as an almost-every-down playmaker at nickelback. The tie goes to Zabel because while Emmanwori missed three games and most of a fourth, Seattle's left guard has played almost 99% of the team's offensive snaps. -- Brady Henderson

2. Los Angeles Rams (11-4)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Seahawks 38-37 (OT)

Week 16 ranking: 1

Rookie of the year: Tight end Terrance Ferguson

Ferguson, a second-round pick, joined a crowded group of tight ends with the Rams. He was a healthy scratch in Weeks 3 and 4 but was active in Week 5 while starter Tyler Higbee was dealing with a hip injury. Since then, Ferguson has 9 catches for 177 yards and 2 touchdowns. He has been especially important as the offense has found its identity in 13 personnel (three tight ends). ""He's going to be a hell of a player, and he's becoming a hell of a player before our eyes,"" coach Sean McVay said earlier this month. -- Sarah Barshop

3. Denver Broncos (12-3)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Jaguars 34-20

Week 16 ranking: 3

Rookie of the year: Running back RJ Harvey

Harvey's 11 total touchdowns (seven rushing, four receiving), lead the team and all rookie position players in the league. The second-round pick is also tied for 13th in scoring, one spot behind Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown and one ahead of Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins. And with J.K. Dobbins on injured reserve (foot) since Week 10, Harvey is without question the team's RB1. -- Jeff Legwold

4. New England Patriots (12-3)

Week 16 result: Beat the Ravens 28-24

Week 16 ranking: 4

Rookie of the year: Running back TreVeyon Henderson

He leads the team with 776 rushing yards on 146 carries (5.3 average), and has eight total touchdowns. Rookie left guard Jared Wilson described Henderson's big-play threat this way: ""Any time he touches the ball, it could end up in the end zone."" Henderson has four touchdown runs of 50 yards or more. The Patriots might be without him this week, however, as he exited Sunday's gamein the second quarterbecause of a concussion and didn't return. -- Mike Reiss

5. Jacksonville Jaguars (11-4)

Week 16 result: Beat the Broncos 34-20

Week 16 ranking: 6

Rookie of the year: Running back Bhayshul Tuten

With cornerback/wide receiver Travis Hunter out for the year, the Jaguars' fourth-round pick has made the biggest contribution in 2025. Tuten has rushed for 284 yards (third on the team) and four touchdowns, while catching 10 passes for 79 yards and 2 touchdowns. As the main backup to Travis Etienne Jr., Tuten is also the Jaguars' leading kick returner (28.4 yards per return on 19 returns). He is likely to miss the rest of the regular season because of a finger injury he suffered in Week 15, but he is expected to return for the playoffs. -- Mike DiRocco

6. San Francisco 49ers (11-4)

Week 16 result:Beat the Colts 48-27

Week 16 ranking: 7

Rookie of the year: Cornerback Upton Stout

Stout has been the starting nickelback all season. Though he has had some bumps, he has also delivered some big plays in crucial moments, including a late-game pass breakup to set up the winning points in Week 3and a forced fumble at the goal line to preserve a victory in Week 11. Stout has played the sixth-most snaps of any Niners defender and is among the top three in total tackles (72). -- Nick Wagoner

7. Buffalo Bills (11-4)

Week 16 result: Beat the Browns 23-20

Week 16 ranking: 5

Rookie of the year: Tight end Jackson Hawes

This is very close between Hawes and defensive tackle Deone Walker, who has started 14 games this season. The edge goes to Hawes, a fifth-round pick, for his significant impact in helpingJames Cook IIIdeliver one of the best rushing seasons in team history (1,532 yards). Despite being drafted as a blocking tight end, Hawes has also emerged as a solid target for quarterbackJosh Allen, catching 15 of 18 targets for 187 yards, 13 first downs and 3 touchdowns. He should receive an even bigger role moving forward. -- Alaina Getzenberg

8. Chicago Bears (11-4)

Week 16 result: Beat the Packers 22-16 (OT)

Week 16 ranking: 10

Rookie of the year: Tight end Colston Loveland

The No. 11 pick introduced himself to the NFL in Chicago's wild comeback win over Cincinnati in Week 9 with a 118-yard, two-touchdown performance that included the 58-yard winner. Since then, he has gotten no fewer than four targets a game from quarterback Caleb Williams. The Bears utilize 12 personnel (two tight ends) at one of the highest rates in the league, and that's reflected in Loveland's 57.8% snap count for the season (fourth highest among the team's skill players). He creates every bit of a mismatch nightmare that Chicago expected when it selected him. And Loveland's willingness as a blocker is critically important to the NFL's No. 2 rushing offense. -- Courtney Cronin

9. Los Angeles Chargers (11-4)

Week 16 result: Beat the Cowboys 34-17

Week 16 ranking: 11

Rookie of the year: Wide receiver Tre' Harris

If not for injury, this honor likely would have gone to running back Omarion Hampton. Instead, it goes to Harris, who has emerged as a surprisingly impactful run blocker who made several big plays in the passing game recently. The latest came in a win over the Chiefs inWeek 15, when Harris hauled in a 37-yard reception that set up a momentum-shifting touchdown just before halftime. ""This is a guy who played three positions in the last game with zero mental errors,"" offensive coordinator Greg Roman said. ""That's a testament to him, and it bodes very well for his future."" -- Kris Rhim

10. Philadelphia Eagles (10-5)

Week 16 result: Beat the Commanders 29-18

Week 16 ranking: 8

Rookie of the year: Linebacker Jihaad Campbell

Campbell, a first-round pick out of Alabama, has 63 tackles, an interception, two passes defensed and a forced fumble. His playing time decreased when Nakobe Dean (knee) hit his stride around the midway point of the season, but he has maintained a role in coordinator Vic Fangio's defense and stepped up his production when Dean exited Saturday's win because of a hamstring injury. -- Tim McManus

11. Green Bay Packers (9-5-1)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Bears 22-16 (OT)

Week 16 ranking: 9

Rookie of the year: Wide receiver Matthew Golden

The only other candidate here would be second-round offensive tackle Anthony Belton, who has played slightly more snaps than Golden. Though the first-round pick hasn't lived up to preseason expectations after his big plays in training camp, his 27 receptions for 341 yards provides hope that there's more to come. He was the fourth receiver taken but is tied for eighth in receptions among pass catchers in his class. Injuries (three missed games) and a lack of opportunities have played a part. ""I think we haven't gotten him the ball enough this year,"" quarterback Jordan Love said recently. -- Rob Demovsky

12. Pittsburgh Steelers (9-6)

Week 16 result: Beat the Lions 29-24

Week 16 ranking: 14

Rookie of the year: Defensive tackle Derrick Harmon

Harmon is the obvious choice. The rest of the Steelers' draft class, which didn't include a second-round pick because of the DK Metcalf trade, hasn't had a big impact this season. Harmon, though, is the exception. He was named a starter from day one and has been a key run defender. In 10 games with the first-round pick in the lineup, the Steelers have allowed 87.9 rushing yards per game. Without Harmon, who has missed five games because ofknee injuries, the Steelers have allowed 165.6. -- Brooke Pryor

13. Houston Texans (10-5)

Week 16 result: Beat the Raiders 23-21

Week 16 ranking: 13

Rookie of the year: Left tackle Aireontae Ersery

Ersery has flashed potential while replacing Pro Bowl left tackle Laremy Tunsil, who was tradedto the Commanders in March. Ersey has been the best and most available rookie for the Texans, helping protect quarterback C.J. Stroudas they make their final push for the playoffs. Ersery has given up nine sacks this season, according to NFL Next Gen Stats, and his pass block win rate is tied for 51st out of 69 eligible tackles. But there have still been enough positives for Houston to feel it got its long-term answer on Stroud's blind side. -- DJ Bien-Aime

14. Detroit Lions (8-7)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Steelers 29-24

Week 16 ranking: 12

Rookie of the year: Wide receiver Isaac TeSlaa

Although TeSlaa has received limited action, the rookie receiver has been a star in his role. Five of his 12 receptions have gone for touchdowns. He has also produced several jaw-dropping plays, including a ridiculous one-handed grab for his first career touchdown in Week 1against the Packers. TeSlaa is the fourth rookie wide receiver in franchise history to log at least five touchdown receptions, joining Amon-Ra St. Brown (2021), Titus Young (2011) and Roy Williams (2004). -- Eric Woodyard

15. Indianapolis Colts (8-7)

Week 16 result:Lost to the 49ers 48-27

Week 16 ranking: 16

Rookie of the year: Tight end Tyler Warren

Only wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. (104) has more targets than Warren's 99 on the team, a fact that speaks to the rookie's sizable role in the Colts' offense. His production has tailed off in recent weeks, much like the rest of the team because of the difficult quarterback situation since Daniel Jones' fibula injury and subsequent torn Achilles. But few tight ends have asserted themselves at every level the way Warren has -- out of the backfield, on screens, on intermediate routes and on deep routes. He looks like a foundational player for the franchise. -- Stephen Holder

16. Carolina Panthers (8-7)

Week 16 result: Beat the Buccaneers 23-20

Week 16 ranking: 20

Rookie of the year: Wide receiver Tetairoa McMillan

In addition to being Carolina's receiving leader, he also leads all rookie receivers with 65 catches for 924 yards and 7 touchdowns. He's quarterback Bryce Young's most dependable target and a big reason the third-year QB's stats have improved significantly in 2025. The Offensive Rookie of the Year award seems inevitable for McMillan, justifying Carolina drafting him No. 8. -- David Newton

17. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-8)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Panthers 23-20

Week 16 ranking: 21

Rookie of the year: Wide receiver Emeka Egbuka

Though Egbuka has seen a drop in production in the second half of the season, what he gave to the team when its receiving corps was decimated can't be overstated. His 163 receiving yards against the Seahawks remains the highest single-game receiving performance on the team; his 910 receiving yards and six touchdowns are second most among rookies. He should be a key player for the Bucs in the future. -- Jenna Laine

18. Baltimore Ravens (7-8)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Patriots 28-24

Week 16 ranking: 15

Rookie of the year: Safety Malaki Starks

Starks has lived up to the expectations of being the No. 27 pick. He is one of three rookie defensive backs to record over 70 tackles and multiple interceptions this season. The Ravens have been impressed with his maturity and awareness. ""He's conscientious, so he always wants to do things right,"" coach John Harbaugh said. It's a difficult decision to choose Baltimore's top rookie, considering the team drafted three immediate starters in 2025 -- Starks, edge rusher Mike Green (second round) and inside linebacker Teddye Buchanan (fourth round). On special teams, kicker Tyler Loop (sixth round) and return specialist LaJohntay Wester (sixth round) have also been impactful. -- Jamison Hensley

19. Minnesota Vikings (7-8)

Week 16 result: Beat the Giants 16-13

Week 16 ranking: 22

Rookie of the year: Left guardDonovan Jackson

Jackson is the only Vikings rookie who has played more than 300 snaps this season, so the list of options here is limited. But the No. 24 pick has proved he belongs since day one. He has been especially effective as a run blocker, ranking No. 6 in the NFL in run block win rate among guards. Whether he develops into a Pro Bowl-level player remains to be seen, but he at least can be counted on as a long-term starter. -- Kevin Seifert

20. Dallas Cowboys (6-8-1)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Chargers 34-17

Week 16 ranking: 17

Rookie of the year: Right guard Tyler Booker

All he had to do was replace a future Hall of Famer in Zack Martin. Booker has not disappointed. The No. 12 pick missed three games because of a high ankle sprain but has elevated his play in the past month. Booker has been one of the reasons the Cowboys have a 4,000-yard passer (Dak Prescott), 1,000-yard rusher (Javonte Williams) and two 1,000-yard receivers (CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens).But what has set him apart is his demeanor. He plays with a professionalism not normally seen in a rookie, and he has a mean streak that helps get the dirty work done. -- Todd Archer

21. Atlanta Falcons (6-9)

Week 16 result: Beat the Cardinals 26-19

Week 16 ranking: 24

Rookie of the year: Edge rusher James Pearce Jr.

The Falcons had three potential candidates; edge rusher Jalon Walker and safety Xavier Watts have been very good as rookies, but Pearce has put together the most impressive numbers. His 8.5 sacks are the most any Falcons player has had since 2019, and the most by a Falcons rookie since the stat became official in 1982. Pearce has at least half a sack in seven straight games, and his sack rate (3%) ranks 10th in the NFL. Among rookies, Pearce is the best in sacks, sack rate and quarterback pressure rate (14%). -- Marc Raimondi

22. Kansas City Chiefs (6-9)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Titans 26-9

Week 16 ranking: 18

Rookie of the year:Left tackle Josh Simmons

Although he played in just eight games, the Chiefs' first-round pick proved he has the talent to be the blindside protector for quarterback Patrick Mahomes in the future. Before his season-ending left wrist injury, Simmons allowed a pressure rate of just 6.6%, the third-lowest mark among left tackles and the second lowest by a rookie left tackle since 2018 (minimum 150 pass blocks), according to NFL Next Gen Stats.-- Nate Taylor

23. Miami Dolphins (6-9)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Bengals 45-21

Week 16 ranking: 19

Rookie of the year: Defensive tackle Jordan Phillips

The Dolphins' rookie class needed to play immediately and has slowly come along during the season. Though first-round defensive tackle Kenneth Grant leads the team in run stop win rate, Phillips has started every game since Week 2. His stats don't necessarily jump off the page, but a defensive tackle's responsibility is often to make an impact that doesn't show up on the stat sheet. He helps set the tone at the line of scrimmage and looks like a hit as a fifth-round pick. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques

24. New Orleans Saints (5-10)

Week 16 result: Beat the Jets 29-6

Week 16 ranking: 25

Rookie of the year: Quarterback Tyler Shough

Shough has a 4-3 record since the Saints announced he would start over Spencer Rattler in Week 9, including wins in the past three games. Even though he has played without several injured players on offense, the excitement around the second-round pick hasn't dampened. In Sunday's win over the Jets, Shough became the Saints' first 300-year passer in two years. Though most of the Saints' rookies have contributed this season, it was Shough who turned around the second half of the season. -- Katherine Terrell

25. Cincinnati Bengals (5-10)

Week 16 result: Beat the Dolphins 45-21

Week 16 ranking: 23

Rookie of the year: Linebacker Barrett Carter

There aren't a ton of great options to choose from given Cincinnati's season, but Carter has done an admirable job in trying circumstances. After five games, he was made the full-time starter at middle linebacker. That role gave him major defensive responsibilities, from relaying the playcalls to aligning the front of the defense. It was an unanticipated workload for the fourth-round pick, but he has learned on the job and gained experience that should be helpful for the Bengals in 2026. -- Ben Baby

26. Washington Commanders (4-11)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Eagles 29-18

Week 16 ranking: 26

Rookie of the year: Right tackle Josh Conerly Jr.

Running back Jacory Croskey-Merritt has thrived with 671 rushing yards and six touchdowns, but Conerly is the lone Commander to play every snap from scrimmage this season. He struggled early this season while facing pass rushers such as Brian Burns, Micah Parsons and Maxx Crosby in his first three games. But he settled in and has steadily improved, saying he's more confident. ""Had some tough moments [ early ] ,"" offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury said, ""but ... I've been really impressed by the work ethic and just the mental toughness he's displayed."" -- John Keim

27. Tennessee Titans (3-12)

Week 16 result: Beat the Chiefs 26-9

Week 16 ranking: 31

Rookie of the year: Wide receiver Chimere Dike

Dike is the NFL leader in all-purpose yards (2,269), and he set a Titans franchise record with 1,535 kick return yards. He's the fourth rookie in NFL history with at least four receiving touchdowns and multiple punt return touchdowns (two) in a season. Perhaps the best example of Dike's impact is how he affects the game without touching the ball. Playcaller Bo Hardegree said he has designed plays with fake end arounds and jet motions to force defenses out of position when they focus on Dike, allowing a different player to find open space. -- Turron Davenport

28. Arizona Cardinals (3-12)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Falcons 26-19

Week 16 ranking: 28

Rookie of the year: Cornerback Denzel Burke

The fifth-round pick was thrown into the starting rotation because of injuries and role changes, but he has flourished as his playing time has increased. He has a team-leading three interceptions with 35 tackles and nine passes defended. Burke's three picks are tied for the most among rookies, and he has done it in 410 fewer snaps than his co-leader, Atlanta safety Xavier Watts. -- Josh Weinfuss

29. Cleveland Browns (3-12)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Bills 23-20

Week 16 ranking: 29

Rookie of the year: Linebacker Carson Schwesinger

The favorite to win Defensive Rookie of the Year (-1400 at DraftKings), Schwesinger has been at the center of the action all season for one of the league's top defenses. The No. 33 pick leads all rookies in total tackles (147) and tackles for loss (11), and he is tied for second among rookies with two interceptions. Schwesinger, a former walk-on at UCLA, has also worn the green dot all season to relay the defensive playcalls. -- Daniel Oyefusi

30. New York Jets (3-12)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Saints 29-6

Week 16 ranking: 30

Rookie of the year: Right tackle Armand Membou

A no-brainer. The No. 7 pick has been terrific since day one. Among tackles, he ranks 12th in run block win rate and 21st in pass block win rate. He has started and finished every game, rarely looking like he's overmatched even against the best competition. It certainly looks like general manager Darren Mougey nailed his first draft pick. With Membou and second-year left tackle Olu Fashanu, the Jets should have their bookend tackles for years to come. -- Rich Cimini

31. New York Giants (2-13)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Vikings 16-13

Week 16 ranking: 27

Rookie of the year: Quarterback Jaxson Dart

The rookie quarterback has hit a recent rough stretch after hisconcussion, including Sunday's ugly 33-yard passing performance. But it hasn't soured the Giants' view on Dart. Interim coach Mike Kafka still believes he's playing good football. Dart has 20 total touchdowns and seven turnovers in 10 starts. He has also rushed for over 400 yards. Several impending free agents on the team have said Dart's presence is a significant selling point to return. -- Jordan Raanan

32. Las Vegas Raiders (2-13)

Week 16 result: Lost to the Texans 23-21

Week 16 ranking: 32

Rookie of the year: Running back Ashton Jeanty

Jeanty, the No. 6 pick, hasn't had the season he and many others expected. But his performance against the Texans (188 total yards and two touchdowns) was a reminder of why the Raiders drafted him so high. Despite the Raiders' run-blocking struggles, Jeanty has still gained 828 yards and 10 total touchdowns. ""I'm sure there's people questioning and doubting [ Jeanty ] ,"" coach Pete Carroll said Sunday. ""It can mount on a young guy, can mount on anybody. For him to show like that, it's a beautiful expression of who he is and what he's all about."" -- Ryan McFadden

Head coach John Harbaugh said on Monday that Jackson is day to day after suffering a ""significant contusion"" in his back in the first half of Sunday night’s loss to the New England Patriots.

The MRI showed no additional damage.

""It doesn't look like it's more than that,"" Harbaugh told reporters. ""He's in there getting treatment now.""

Jackson left the loss just before halftime after suffering the back injury. The QB was hit on a scramble and played the next snap before exiting in clear pain. Jackson was 7-of-10 passing for 101 yards and a 102.5 passer rating before the injury. Tyler Huntley took over for the rest of the game, going 9-of-10 passing for 65 yards.

It's been an injury-plagued campaign for Jackson, who missed three games due to a hamstring injury earlier this season.

The injury came at a brutal time, as the Ravens were trying to keep pace with the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC North.

Harbaugh's club has lost three of its past four games after winning five straight. With Sunday's defeat, Baltimore now needs to win out and get some help. The Ravens must win in Green Bay in Week 17 and get a Browns victory over Pittsburgh to set up a winner-take-all Week 18 game.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/luz3flw7ii4ir0r5hgqn,N,,2025-12-23 12:07:23.685145

The CBS broadcast showed Metcalf talking to the fan, who was in a blue wig and hanging over the first-row railing.
The fan, who threw his hands up after Metcalf made contact with him, appeared to have a yellow jersey in his hands.
With Metcalf suspended, the Steelers will be without a clear No.
While running back Kenneth Gainwell leads the Steelers with 62 receptions, Metcalf leads the team with 850 receiving yards on 59 catches.","PITTSBURGH -- Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf has been suspended two games without pay by the NFL ""for conduct detrimental to the NFL for initiating a physical confrontation with a fan"" during Sunday's game at Ford Field in Detroit.

According to the NFL release, Metcalf's actions violate the league policy that specifies ""players may not enter the stands or otherwise confront fans at any time on game day and ... if a player makes unnecessary physical contact with a fan in any way that constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct or presents crowd-control issues and/or risk of injury, he will be held accountable.""

Metcalf plans to appeal the suspension, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter. If the suspension stands, Metcalf will forfeit $555,556 for the two games. The suspension would also void $45 million in future guaranteed money, according to his contract, which was reviewed by CBS Sports and ESPN.

Ryan Kennedy, the Detroit Lions fan involved in the altercation with Metcalf on Sunday, denied he used a racial slur, ""misogynistic, or hate-based language during the incident,"" according to a statement released by a Michigan law firm on Monday.

""These allegations are completely false,"" said the statement released by Shawn Head and Sean Murphy of Head Murphy Law Firm.

The statement also said that Kennedy has experienced ""harassment, threats and messages advocating violence"" since reports began circulating on social media that Kennedy used a racial slur toward Metcalf and called Metcalf's mother an inflammatory word.

Metcalf, who played for the Seattle Seahawks before being traded to the Steelers this year, reported Kennedy to Seattle team security in the past, a source confirmed to ESPN's Brady Henderson. The Seahawks played at Detroit in 2022, 2023 and 2024.

The CBS broadcast showed Metcalf talking to the fan, who was in a blue wig and hanging over the first-row railing.

""He came over because the fan in the stands was holding a '4' Pittsburgh jersey. He went over, and the fan said something to him,"" CBS sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson said on the broadcast. ""Obviously, Metcalf did not like what he said, and you saw the swipe there. No Steelers came over to him and mentioned anything.""

In an angle of the incident posted on Instagram, Metcalf walked up to the fan, grabbed him by his shirt collar to pull him closer then forcefully shoved him back. The fan, who threw his hands up after Metcalf made contact with him, appeared to have a yellow jersey in his hands.

With Metcalf suspended, the Steelers will be without a clear No. 1 receiver against the Cleveland Browns and the Baltimore Ravens in their final two regular-season games, and the position group could be even more depleted after Calvin Austin III left the 29-24 victory against the Lions with a hamstring injury.

While running back Kenneth Gainwell leads the Steelers with 62 receptions, Metcalf leads the team with 850 receiving yards on 59 catches. Austin is the next-closest receiver with 28 catches for 317 yards on 48 targets. The Steelers, though, got a late-season boost with the addition of wide receiver Adam Thielen, claimed off waivers from the Minnesota Vikings. The team also added Marquez Valdes-Scantling to the practice squad earlier this season and promoted him to the active roster prior to the Week 15 win against the Miami Dolphins.

Thielen led Steelers receivers with four catches on four targets for 49 yards against the Lions.

The Steelers also played veteran wideout Scotty Miller once Austin left the game. Miller finished with three catches on three targets for 19 yards, including a pair of third-quarter snags to convert fourth-and-2 and third-and-4.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1221%2Fr1592518_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 10:15:39.732869

Now he helps patients in need.,Ron Southwick,,,,,https://www.chiefhealthcareexecutive.com/view/ryan-shazier-s-nfl-career-ended-with-a-spinal-cord-injury-now-he-helps-patients-in-need-,"On Dec. 4, 2017, Shazier suffered a devastating spinal cord injury in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals.
So mentally, that's a lot to deal with.” Shazier suffered a spinal cord contusion, which paralyzed his lower body.
He has established the Ryan Shazier Fund, which helps those grappling with spinal cord injuries.
Many patients with spinal cord injuries need more rehab sessions than they get, and Shazier says he had well over 100 rehab sessions.
“Most individuals with a spinal cord injury, everybody asks about them,” Shazier says.","As a linebacker with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Ryan Shazier raced across the field with uncommon speed to tackle opposing players.

Shazier quickly established himself as a star, with his peers voting him among the top 50 players in the National Football League. Then at age 25, in just his fourth season, Shazier’s career was over.

On Dec. 4, 2017, Shazier suffered a devastating spinal cord injury in a game against the Cincinnati Bengals. He was told that the odds are he wouldn’t walk again.

“I was one of the fastest people on the planet,” Shazier says. “Now I couldn't walk. So mentally, that's a lot to deal with.”

Shazier suffered a spinal cord contusion, which paralyzed his lower body. He defied the odds and managed to walk again, a prospect which seemed unfathomable in the days after the injury. But he’s taken big steps in other ways.

He has established the Ryan Shazier Fund, which helps those grappling with spinal cord injuries. The fund offers financial assistance to help pay for additional rehabilitation sessions or help with other needs, including accommodations at homes and support for caregivers.

In a conversation with Chief Healthcare Executive®, Shazier, who is 33, says he wants to help those who faced some of his challenges.

“When I got injured, it was something that I didn't really know much about,” Shazier says. “I didn't have a big understanding of the spinal cord community and the lack of resources and support.”

(See part of our conversation with Ryan Shazier. The story continues below.)

‘Meet people where they are’

Earlier this month, on the eighth anniversary of the injury that ended his football career, Shazier returned to UC Medical Center in Cincinnati. He visited staff that cared for him in the days after the injury.

“That's why I wanted to go back two weeks ago and just basically say thank you, because of the support that they gave,” he says, adding, “I just wanted to say thank you, because I wouldn't be where I'm at if it weren't for those wonderful doctors and nurses.”

Shazier was later transferred to UPMC, where he continued his recovery. When Shazier suffered the injury, he initially envisioned a return to the gridiron. But doctors told him that he had a 20% chance of even walking again.

“I wanted to get better and tried everything I could to learn how to walk and to get back to being able to play football. And I didn't understand how serious it was in the moment,” Shazier says.

He says his conditioning and his experience with years of rigorous training aided his recovery, but he still had to confront the reality of his situation.

“Nothing really prepares you for this,” he says. “There's nothing you're going to deal with … that's even relatively close.”

While he would not be able to resume his NFL career, Shazier regained the ability to walk, albeit with a slight limp.

Now, he’s aiming to help others with similar injuries through his foundation. Shazier says people have been amazed by his recovery, but many don’t understand how difficult the road is for people with severe spinal cord injuries.

“They see in my recovery, and it took so many rehab sessions for me to get there, and I'm still not 100% healthy. It took so much for me to be able to get there. So just to be able to give that back is everything to me,” Shazier says.

“This is a journey that you need as much community, as much support as you can possibly get to help you overcome it,” he says. “And that’s one of the reasons that I want to start this fund, to be able to give the same impact to those who were struggling like I was.”

The Ryan Shazier Fund offers financial support to help patients get more rehabilitation sessions. Shazier is based in the Pittsburgh area, but his fund goes beyond the Steel City.

The fund has given more than $1 million in stipends to families, and recently expanded. It is now offering services to patients across Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio.

Shazier says it’s “really exciting” to have a bigger reach.

“I think it's very important just to try to help as many people as possible,” he says.

Many patients with spinal cord injuries need more rehab sessions than they get, and Shazier says he had well over 100 rehab sessions.

“After a spinal cord injury, some of the costs associated with it after the injury could be up to over a million dollars, you know, within the first year,” Shazier says.

“If their rehab is going well, and they feel like they're making progress, and they may want more rehab to help them get to that next step, we may actually pay for more rehab sessions,” he says.

Shazier says the fund provides assistance in other ways, including helping patients who have transportation needs to get to their health providers. In some cases, the fund has helped individuals who need work done in their homes to allow them to move around more freely.

“We kind of meet people where they are,” Shazier says.

The fund also aims to help caregivers of individuals who have suffered spinal cord injuries, connecting them with others in their situation so they have people to talk to who understand their new reality. The fund also can provide financial assistance to caregivers, including transportation needs or counseling.

“Most individuals with a spinal cord injury, everybody asks about them,” Shazier says. “The person that's taking care of them, their life has changed just as the person with the injury.”

‘Building community’

Shazier says he’s gratified to help others struggling with spinal cord injuries, and he especially wants them to know that they aren’t alone.

“They felt the same way I felt,” he says. “They felt scared, they felt lost. They didn't know anybody that was dealing with the same type of injury. So now to be able to provide that support to them and just let them know that we're here if they need anything, we're trying to help them reach whatever goal that they have as well … to me, I think that's the biggest thing. Just building community.”

“When it comes to anybody that's going through some type of adversity, it takes a village and it takes a community,” Shazier says. “I think that's the thing that I really care about the most.”

While Shazier says he’d like to help everyone, he’s grateful that the foundation has grown to the point where it can offer services in three states.

“I just think it's just taking it one step at a time, growing it slowly but surely, but just trying to just be there, because the biggest thing is just providing quality of life to people and until we find a cure,” he says.

Now that the fund is aiming to help more people, Shazier says the foundation has exceeded his initial expectations.

“I remember when I first came up with it, I didn't know much about what a foundation was, and I was just like, I just want to help people with a spinal cord injury,” he says.

“And now, just to be able to hear the stories, and understanding how we've been able to allow people more opportunities and allow them to live freely, it's been nice. I'm just happy, and I'm a guy that is constantly want to keep going and keep growing, and turn this into something that we can help as many people as possible.”",https://cdn.sanity.io/images/0vv8moc6/che/ea89e99508b438968d8b8819e2dd66a363990356-636x480.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 04:00:46.307943

Of note, linebacker Dre Greenlaw (hamstring), tight end Nate Adkins (knee), wide receiver Pat Bryant (concussion) and center Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) were estimated non-participants. Every other player on the active roster -- including linebacker Justin Strnad (foot) -- was an estimated full participant.

Greenlaw pulled up late in the fourth quarter of Sunday's game, DTY injured his knee in his first game back from a 2023 ACL injury, Adkins went down with a knee injury after previously missing five games due to a knee injury earlier this year and Bryant suffered a scary injury on the second-to-last play of the game.

Bryant was released from the hospital with a concussion on Sunday evening. He is now in the NFL's concussion protocol and seems extremely unlikely to play against the Chiefs.

49ers vs. Colts MNF Highlights: Purdy's Career Night, Rivers Pick-6 Sinks Indy

Updated:

Two of the NFL's best headlined a Week 16 matchup with playoff implications, as Christian McCaffrey and the San Francisco 49ers defeated Jonathan Taylor and the Indianapolis Colts, 48-27, at Lucas Oil Stadium.

McCaffrey outdueled Taylor, who entered Monday Night Football ranked second in rushing yards (1,443), and Brock Purdy turned in a career-best effort to lead the Niners to a big win.

Purdy's performance gave him the edge in an intriguing quarterback battle against 44-year-old Philip Rivers, who played valiantly in his second game after a five-year retirement. The 49ers (11-4) secured a playoff berth Sunday and have now improved their chances at the No. 1 seed by beating a scrappy 8-7 Colts team that may end up missing the postseason.

Broncos linebacker Dre Greenlaw (hamstring), safety Delarrin Turner-Yell (knee), tight end Nate Adkins (knee) and wide receiver Pat Bryant (concussion) all left Sunday's game and did not return.

Greenlaw pulled up late in the fourth quarter and was quickly ruled out. Hamstring injuries can be tricky, so he seems unlikely to be ready in time for a Thursday Night Football showdown with the Kansas City Chiefs on Dec. 25.

Turner-Yell hurt his knee one day after being elevated from the practice squad to the game-day roster on Saturday. It was a heartbreaking development for the safety, who was making his return to action after missing all of the 2024 season after tearing his ACL in Week 17 of the 2023 season.

Adkins appeared to suffer a non-contact knee injury early in the second quarter. Adkins previously missed five games earlier this season with a knee injury.

Bryant was the most high-profile injury of the game. On the second-to-last play of the night, Bryant took a brutal hit from cornerback Montaric Brown. Bryant was then loaded onto a backboard, carted off the field and taken by ambulance to a local hospital.

Broncos coach Sean Payton said in his postgame press conference that Bryant had movement in his hands and legs, and the receiver was released from the hospital with a concussion on Sunday evening. Bryant is now in the NFL's concussion protocol, and he's extremely unlikely to play on TNF later this week.

Denver will not practice today, but the team is required to release three injury reports leading up to Thursday's game, so we should receive an estimated injury report later today. The Broncos could be missing several key players when they travel to Kansas City for an AFC West showdown on Christmas.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/22/SBRC/87878731007-broncos-injury-updates-delarrin-turner-yell.jpg?crop=5398,3037,x0,y359&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-22 23:59:02.590268

And I was like, 'Well, it's really serious,' but I got great news and I've been happy all day, for real.""
So while he could close out the season with his battle against the Chargers, he has no interest in doing so.
""I'm playing for pride and also playing for this locker room, and this brotherhood,"" the 26-year-old said.
I want to show up every time, and every time they need me, I just want to be there.""","""We got great news this morning after the MRI,"" Flournoy said on Monday, after being a limited participant in the team's walkthrough, and wearing a smile bright enough to challenge the sun itself. ""I was praying, and God has blessed me, in tremendous ways. We are working towards playing Thursday.

""I'm not giving up on the season, so I'm looking forward to playing this Thursday, if I can. I wanna play.""

The news made its way to the offensive meeting room ahead of practice, and head coach Brian Schottenheimer says it was met with everyone celebrating and several players beating on their desks and yelling to show their happiness for Flournoy, who readily admits he was afraid he'd be done for the season, and potentially the offseason program (and training camp?) after he felt something weird in his knee during the late hit.

""I was a little fearful — I was,"" he said. ""It's because of the way I got twisted up, I felt a little click and pop, and couldn't return to the game, and that hurt me. And I was like, 'Well, it's really serious,' but I got great news and I've been happy all day, for real.""

For Flournoy, football, and particularly his roster spot with the Cowboys, is so much bigger than the game itself, and that's what he's hoping to show on Christmas, and every game thereafter, for years to come. So while he could close out the season with his battle against the Chargers, he has no interest in doing so.

""I'm playing for pride and also playing for this locker room, and this brotherhood,"" the 26-year-old said. ""Being in the league, I've learned that some people are not going to be here next year, and I just want to go out and play with my brothers on this 2025 Cowboys team, two more times, and just have fun with them and just fight with them.

""Man, this brotherhood is special to me and just me being able to play for them.""

Far and away, this has been the best of Flournoy's two NFL seasons, in every category. The former sixth-round pick (2024) has already been active in 15 games (career-high) with three starts (career-high) and reeled in 407 receiving yards (career-high) on 35 receptions (career-high) with four touchdowns (career-high), and averages 11.6 yards per catch (career-high).

There's a theme there, certainly, and it's that the 2025 campaign, for Flournoy, is a career-high; and with so much promise on the horizon, and given his journey to get to this point — including a stint at Iowa Western Community College — don't count on him turning down on any rep awarded to him, regardless of the Cowboys' elimination from playoff contention.

Insert Mamba Mentality here.

""I feel like I established myself very well,"" he said. ""Job's not done, though. I still want to keep climbing and keep going, be consistent every time, and just be me. I want to show up every time, and every time they need me, I just want to be there.""

In the event Flournoy is not cleared for Christmas, he will have had roughly two weeks between the injury having occurred to the Cowboys' season finale against the New York Giants, meaning there's a great chance he'll at least have one more opportunity to finish his breakout season strong — something he was afraid wouldn't be possible just 24 short hours ago.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/xfjsopvnlvduas2jxqhv,N,,2025-12-22 23:59:07.184048

Week after week, key contributors are exiting games early, leaving managers scrambling for answers and contingency plans. As the NFL playoffs near finalization across the league, teams may begin prioritizing long-term health over short-term availability.

Below is a breakdown of the most impactful injuries from the weekend and what they could mean moving forward.

Key: Position Player, Team | Injury | Projected Return to Play

QB Lamar Jackson, Baltimore | Back | Timeline TBD

During Sunday night’s loss to the New England Patriots, Lamar Jackson was injured and later listed as questionable by the Baltimore Ravens with a back injury. After halftime, head coach John Harbaugh was coy when asked about Jackson’s status and wouldn't give a straight answer on whether his veteran quarterback would return. Shortly after, Jackson was ruled out.

By video, the injury appeared more consistent with a rib issue. It has been an injury-riddled season for Jackson. While Baltimore is not officially out of the playoff hunt, the team may take a cautious approach and consider shutting him down if his health continues to trend in the wrong direction.

RB TreVeyon Henderson, New England | Concussion | Projecting Week 18 Return

TreVeyon Henderson sustained a head injury in the second quarter of Sunday night’s game. After halftime, the team ruled the rookie running back out with a concussion.

Henderson will have a week to progress through the league’s concussion protocol, which is possible, but historically unlikely based on comparable cases.

RB Quinshon Judkins, Cleveland | Leg/Ankle | Season-Ending

Quinshon Judkins sustained a serious lower-body injury and had to be carted off the field. Postgame reports confirmed that the rookie running back suffered an ankle dislocation along with an associated fracture. As a result, Judkins’ 2025 season is over, but based on typical recovery timelines for this type of injury, he is expected to be ready for the 2026 season.

The Vikings were off on Monday, with no update on McCarthy's status expected until Tuesday.
McCarthy's hand appeared to hit a Giants defender's helmet two plays before his rushing touchdown on a head-first dive into the end zone after a third-down scramble.
Injury report The condition of McCarthy's right hand has become by far the most important matter of the shortened week, but the status of Mason and Jones will also bear watching.
Key number 12 — The Vikings have won 12 straight games against opponents starting a rookie quarterback, the longest active streak in the NFL.","MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Minnesota Vikings must ask themselves this offseason how patient they can afford to be with quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who has shown his share of as-advertised winning traits and athletic talents but just as many alarming tendencies during this up-and-down debut.

How quickly the Vikings believe his mechanics can be improved and his consistency can increase might not matter as much as whether they feel he can be counted on to regularly take the field.

After hurting his throwing hand during Minnesota's victory over the New York Giants on Sunday, his fourth significant injury in two years, McCarthy was unable to play in the second half and is now uncertain to be healthy enough to play again this season. The Vikings host Detroit on Thursday, leaving only three full days to heal. They finish against Green Bay on Jan. 3 or 4.

“You would love to have him for two straight home games to finish, and we’ll see where his hand is at and if he has the ability to play for us again. I sure hope so,” coach Kevin O'Connell said.

The Vikings were off on Monday, with no update on McCarthy's status expected until Tuesday. The initial X-rays at the stadium showed no fracture, but further examination in Minnesota was planned.

After his entire rookie year was wiped out by a torn meniscus in his right knee, the 10th pick in the 2024 draft missed five games with a badly sprained right ankle and one more with a concussion.

McCarthy's hand appeared to hit a Giants defender's helmet two plays before his rushing touchdown on a head-first dive into the end zone after a third-down scramble. When McCarthy returned for the next series, he double-clutched on a screen pass before being leveled by unblocked edge rusher Brian Burns for the sack-fumble-touchdown trifecta. The pain in his hand was too severe to continue playing after that.

Not only have the injuries stunted McCarthy's development, but he can't be counted on to be a franchise quarterback if they keep occurring at this frequency.

""It's part of this game, and he’s a competitor. I think it’s something where he’s going to go out there and lay it on the line every single week,” O'Connell said.

What's working

The pass defense has been mostly impenetrable during the second half of the season. The Vikings have not allowed a passing touchdown in six straight games, tying New England (2018-19) for the longest streak in the league over the last 25 years.

Giants interim coach Mike Kafka was apparently concerned enough about rookie Jaxson Dart's ability to navigate the rush, coverage and disguises devised by Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores that only a handful of passing plays were called in the first half. Dart had just one completion before halftime, plus one interception. The 2.5 net yards per pass attempt for the Giants on Sunday was the lowest average in any game in the NFL this season, according to Sportradar.

What needs help

The Vikings have the eighth-most penalties in the league, after 11 flags went against them for 90 lost yards on Sunday in their fourth game this season with 10-plus infractions. Both Harrison Smith and Eric Wilson had third-down sacks erased by roughing-the-passer penalties, and Wilson's in the fourth quarter extended a drive the Giants finished with a field goal.

Stock up

Running back Aaron Jones injured his right ankle while being stopped for a loss on the second snap on Sunday, only to have sidekick Jordan Mason join him on the sideline just five plays later. The 31-year-old Jones gritted his way through the rest of the game with Mason unable to return, finishing with 85 yards on 21 carries, both season highs.

Stock down

McCarthy's high-velocity throws — the Vikings have tried to teach him to throttle down to match certain routes and coverages in a concept called layering — have been a challenge to catch. But drops have hindered an offense carrying a thin margin for error, and Jordan Addison has been the biggest culprit. He failed to secure a perfectly placed ball after landing in the end zone on a third-down pass from the 25-yard line on the opening drive, forcing the Vikings to settle for a field goal.

Injury report

The condition of McCarthy's right hand has become by far the most important matter of the shortened week, but the status of Mason and Jones will also bear watching.

The most concerning development was a return to the concussion protocol for center Ryan Kelly, who already spent seven weeks on injured reserve this season out of abundant caution toward his career history of head injuries.

“We’re all hoping and really just thinking about him,” O'Connell said. “Don’t have an official kind of diagnosis or anything, but any time anything like that happens, you have concerns.”

Defensive tackle Javon Hargrave didn't play on Sunday because of a thigh injury. Left tackle Christian Darrisaw, edge rusher Jonathan Greenard and safety Josh Metellus are all shut down for the season.

Key number

12 — The Vikings have won 12 straight games against opponents starting a rookie quarterback, the longest active streak in the NFL. Their last such loss was in 2018 to Buffalo with Josh Allen.

Up next

The Vikings (7-8) get the chance to be the Grinch on Christmas and eliminate the division rival Lions (8-7) from contention for the playoffs. A loss for the Lions would, coincidentally, clinch a spot for the Packers (9-5-1), their final opponent.

The Cardinals and Titans are two of four teams with a 3-12 record through Week 16, and strength of schedule is the tiebreaker.

That’s where New England’s Sunday Night Football victory over the Baltimore Ravens came into the picture, as that result improved Tennessee’s strength of schedule.

Arizona and Tennessee have the same opposing win percentage at .575. Their respective final two opponents also have the same records, so the SOS tiebreaker could be fluid over the next two weeks.

Even Monday Night Football could flip them, as a 49ers win over the Colts would drop Arizona back to sixth while an Indianapolis win would improve Tennessee’s strength of schedule.

The Athletic’s draft order model gave the Cardinals a 73% chance to finish with a top five pick after Sunday’s games.

The Cardinals lost 26-19 against the Atlanta Falcons, their seventh consecutive loss and 12th in the past 13 games. Arizona led 13-3 before the Falcons outscored the Cardinals 23-6 for the rest of the game.

Arizona visits the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Rams to end the season, a lame duck first game and possibly relevant finale, as the Rams jockey for playoff positioning in a juggernaut NFC.

This is a big week for the draft order, as the New York Giants visit the Las Vegas Raiders in a loser-likely-earns-the-top-pick showdown.

The Cleveland Browns host the Pittsburgh Steelers after playing the Buffalo Bills tough on Sunday (23-20 loss). Pittsburgh can win the AFC North with a victory.

The New York Jets have gotten blasted by 20-plus for three straight games and have the Patriots and Bills left on the schedule, so there’s not many reasons to expect much help there.

And the Titans have won two of their last three games and play the suddenly-frisky New Orleans Saints at home this week.

The Cardinals’ path to the top three appears to be to lose out and hope for a Browns win and either the Raiders or Giants to end the year with a couple garbage-time wins over non-playoff teams.

What does the latest mock draft say?

Pro Football Focus released a new mock draft on Monday, projecting the Cardinals go with offensive tackle Spencer Fano out of Utah with the No. 5 pick. Quarterbacks Fernando Mendoza and Dante Moore flew off the board with the top two picks.

Quarterback remains a huge question mark for the Cardinals, but they don’t get the opportunity to address it in this mock draft. Instead, they focus on finding a partner for left tackle Paris Johnson Jr. and go with Utah’s Spencer Fano, who earned an 83.7 PFF pass-blocking grade on true pass sets and PFF run-blocking grades above 75.0 on both zone and gap runs.",https://arizonasports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2253061545-e1766431059348.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 00:59:05.482829

The 49ers ruled out wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle) and cornerback Renardo Green (neck) after final practice updates; quarterback Kurtis Rourke (knee) is also out.

The 49ers activated defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos from injured reserve and elevated cornerback Eli Apple and linebacker Eric Kendricks for the game. Kyle Shanahan said Gross-Matos had “a good two days” of practice work and noted Kendricks’ conditioning looked “good,” clearing depth bolsters at edge and linebacker.

On the Colts’ side, they have activated defensive tackle DeForest Buckner from injured reserve ahead of Monday night, with Brett Rypien waived as a corresponding move. Buckner had returned to full practice late last week and is expected to help a defensive front tasked with slowing Brock Purdy and Christian McCaffrey.

Anthony Richardson Sr. is still on the injured reserve, so Philip Rivers starts with the Colts, still in AFC Wild Card contention.

And right now, they're in the midst of a tricky quarterback injury double whammy.

In their loss to the Chicago Bears, the Packers lost Jordan Love to a concussion.

Late in that game, backup QB Malik Willis came down hard on his right shoulder.

On Monday, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that Love is in concussion protocol and that Willis is figuring out that shoulder injury.

The Packers have one other quarterback in the building at the moment, practice squad QB Clayton Tune.

It seems like at least one of Love or Willis will be able to go by Saturday, but it's something that bears watching during the week.

If there was any news about the Packers bringing in other QBs for a workout, that would be a bad sign.

If at least one of Love or Willis is available at practice on Tuesday and Wednesday, worries can start to be mitigated.

It's certainly not what Green Bay wants right now with just two weeks remaining in the regular season.

There's still work to be done, and the Packers would surely prefer to do it with at least one of their reliable quarterbacks on the field.

And there’s no guarantee the two-time NFL MVP will get back on the field in 2025.

Jackson sustained a back bruise in the second quarter of the Ravens’ 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday night. After being kneed by safety Craig Woodson just after the two-minute warning, Jackson handed the ball off to Keaton Mitchell before shuffling to the sideline during a timeout.

He then hobbled into the tunnel and into the locker room, too sore to return in a game the Ravens desperately needed to win to stay in the thick of the playoff hunt.

“He couldn’t go,” coach John Harbaugh said. “If he could have gone, he would have gone.”

The loss dropped Baltimore (7-8) two games behind first-place Pittsburgh in the AFC North with two games to go.

The Ravens are no longer in control of their own destiny, and they have no idea if Jackson will be available to help keep their hopes alive with a victory in Green Bay next Saturday night.

“It’s a bruise of some kind. I don’t know how serious it will be,” Harbaugh said. “We’ll have to find out in the next couple days.”

Jackson is expected to receive a CT scan on Monday. He said he received a shot to ease the pain, but he still was unable to throw the ball effectively and without much discomfort.

It’s been that kind of season for Jackson, who last year finished second in the balloting for MVP and expected to carry the Ravens deep into the postseason in 2025.

Jackson missed three games earlier this season because of a hamstring injury, and since returning from that he’s been listed with knee, ankle and toe problems as well as an illness that caused him to miss a practice before facing the Patriots.

His absence contributed heavily to Baltimore’s 1-5 start. The Ravens regrouped upon his return and remained in control of their own destiny until they blew an 11-point lead in the fourth quarter against New England.

Backup quarterback Tyler Huntley went 9 for 10 for 65 yards, but the Ravens couldn’t maintain possession when it counted in the closing minutes while New England rallied from a 24-13 hole.

Huntley spoke with Jackson on the sideline during the second half, knowing the starter was depressed about being put in the position of giving advice rather than making something happen.

“He was bummed,” Huntley said, “Couldn’t barely move.”

Whether Jackson can return by next week is anyone’s guess.

“You know, you hate to see him like that,” Huntley said, “but I know he gonna be ready to get back out there when he’s ready.”

It’s tough to stay healthy as a quarterback in the NFL, and it’s even more difficult for a quarterback who likes to run the ball.

“It’s a physical game,” Ravens safety Kyle Hamilton noted. “Obviously he’s going to put his body on the line for us. You don’t get all the rushing accolades he gets without taking some hits. We all appreciate that. He plays really hard, and it sucks to see it happen to somebody like that.”

Unfortunately for the Ravens, their season has been defined by injuries, fumbles, untimely penalties and blown leads.

“It’s been a theme for the past couple years, honestly,” Hamilton said. “It’s frustrating at this point. It’s redundant.”

Two lost fumbles, seven penalties and a 380-yard passing performance by New England quarterback Drake Maye left Baltimore with a 3-6 record at home.

“Six losses at home?” Hamilton said. “That’s terrible.”

Allen did not miss a play during the game but did leave the field before halftime and had an X-ray done on his foot. He was cleared to return to the game.

When asked if he anticipated Allen being available for Sunday's game against the visiting Philadelphia Eagles, McDermott said, ""As far as I'm aware, yes.""

The coach added that Allen is sore, but that there were no setbacks and that he is not aware of any further testing needing to be done.

The injury may, however, impact Allen during the practice week.

""I don't know yet. There's a chance it does,"" McDermott said. ""We'll see. We're going to practice a little bit tomorrow based on availability. We've got a number of guys that are not going to be able to practice. We'll see how Josh shows up tomorrow and how he's feeling.""

Linebacker Shaq Thompson (neck), defensive tackle DaQuan Jones (calf) and safety Jordan Poyer (hamstring) are also day-to-day following injuries from the game.

Allen's injury took place on a sack that was ultimately credited to both Browns defenders Myles Garrett and Alex Wright. On second-and-1 from the Buffalo 23 with 1:09 remaining in the second quarter, Allen dropped back but was pressured quickly and ran around, ultimately going backward to try and avoid Browns defenders before falling to the ground.

Allen stayed on the field for a quick quarterback run up the middle on the following play but then walked to the locker room with athletic trainers before halftime, not wearing his right cleat.

After the game, Allen said, ""We're good,"" and that he ""tweaked my foot a little bit.""

Denver did not practice on Monday, which makes the report an estimation of players' participation levels if the Broncos held a practice.

Strnad (foot) suffered an injury in the Broncos' Week 15 game against the Packers and missed Denver's most recent game. He did not practice ahead of Week 16.

The fifth-year linebacker has started seven games this season and 20 contests in his career. Strnad has notched 50 tackles, four tackles for loss, seven quarterback hits, 3.5 sacks, two passes defensed and an interception this year.

Rookie inside linebacker Karene Reid was also listed as a full participant. Reid (hamstring) was designated for return from injured reserve ahead of Week 16, and he remains eligible to be activated to the 53-man roster for the Broncos' ""Thursday Night Football"" game against the Chiefs.

With this game being played on a Thursday (Christmas Day), the Lions’ practice schedule is altered this week. Their initial report comes out on Monday, while the injury declarations will be announced on Wednesday.

The Lions held a walkthrough on Monday, meaning each player’s practice participation level is estimated by the coaching staff, projecting each injured player’s involvement had there been a regular practice on that day.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

TE Brock Wright (neck, IR) — Eligible to return in Week 18

OT Giovanni Manu (knee, IR) — Evaluation clock started

LB Zach Cunningham (hamstring, IR)

S Kerby Joseph (31) — (knee, IR) — Eligible to return in Divisional Round

Joseph was placed on injured reserve last Saturday, and with him not being eligible to return until the Divisional Round of the playoffs, his season is effectively over. The Lions have insisted that he’s been close to returning all season, but they’ve had a difficult time “calming down” his knee, so hopefully an offseason of rest will afford him a proper chance to heal up for 2026.

No practice

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee) — injured in Week 16

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

DB Avonte Maddox (back) — injured in Week 16

St. Brown played on 97% of offensive snaps in Week 16, but a knee injury kept him from an estimated practice on Monday. While this could be a precautionary measure, it’ll be worth monitoring his progress on a short week.

“We’ll know more a little bit later, but this is something that popped up when he came in today,” coach Dan Campbell said at his Monday press conference. “Hopeful that this is just some irritation from the game. That’s what I’m hoping, but I’ll know more later. I’ll know more tonight.”

Decker has routinely taken practices off ahead of games, and on a short week, it wouldn’t be surprising if he doesn’t practice much, if at all, leading up to this game.

Maddox injured his back against the Steelers, but he was able to finish the game, suggesting this could be a rest day for the veteran. However, because this soft-tissue injury likely popped up following the game, it’s worth monitoring.

Limited practice

C Graham Glasgow (knee) — upgraded from no practice

LG Christian Mahogany (fibula)

OL Trystan Colon (wrist)

OT Giovanni Manu (knee) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 14

WR Tom Kennedy (abdomen) — injured in Week 16

DT Alim McNeill (abdomen) — injured in Week 16

EDGE Al-Quadin Muhammad (knee) — injured in Week 16

EDGE Marcus Davenport (shoulder) — Injured in Week 16

CB Amik Robertson (hand)

Glasgow missed the final two practices last week, then was ruled inactive and missed the game against the Steelers. Having to practice just 24 hours later is a challenging task, so it’s not surprising that the Lions are taking it easy with him to start the week. If he isn’t ready to play again this week, look for the Lions to turn to Trystan Colon (who also missed last week’s game due to injury) or Kingsley Eguakun, who started against the Steelers.

Mahogany was removed from injured reserve ahead of the Lions Week 16 game, and played a full complement of snaps, save four that were given to rookie Miles Frazier for developmental purposes. Mahogany was seen limping in the locker room post-game, so hopefully he’ll be able to rest up a bit and play through his discomfort. An estimated limited practice suggests he’ll have a chance to play this week.

Colon missed last week’s game with an injury, despite getting in some limited practices during the week. If he’s able to return to the active roster this week, he could challenge to start if Glasgow is once again unable to play.

Manu continues to work through his injury evaluation window, but the Lions are currently rostering 10 offensive linemen, so they’re not in a situation where they need to rush him back.

Kennedy, McNeill, and Muhammad all played a full complement of snaps in Week 16, yet each suffered a soft tissue injury, which likely would have limited their ability to practice on Monday. An estimated practice is a good sign that they’re in a good position to play this week, but their progress will be worth monitoring.

Davenport injured his shoulder against the Steelers and briefly needed to exit the game. Fortunately, he was cleared to return and was able to finish the game. He’s yet another monitoring situation.

Robertson was able to play in Week 16 with a club on his injured hand. However, he was limited to just 36% of defensive snaps, suggesting he will likely be limited moving forward until his hand heals up.

The players in this section have progressed far enough in their injury rehabilitation that they no longer need to be listed on the injury report.

Vaki practiced in full last week and entered the game without an injury designation. He looks like he’s as healthy as he’s been all season.

Awosika practiced in full last week and did not carry an injury designation into the game, suggesting he was deemed a healthy scratch. If Mahogany’s injury doesn’t get better, Awosika could be back in the mix very quickly.

Harper was able to clear the NFL’s concussion protocols last week and played a full complement of snaps against the Steelers. This injury looks like it’s behind him.

FIRST THOUGHTS ON NEW VETERAN EDGE RUSHER The Bills made an addition to their practice squad late last week, signing veteran DE Matthew Judon.","Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Monday that quarterback Josh Allen is ""day-to-day"" going into Week 17 with a right foot injury that occurred during Sunday's 23-20 win over the Browns.

McDermott shared the QB's foot is ""just sore"" and added that Allen's has not had any additional testing since the end of the game. Allen had X-rays at halftime in Cleveland but was cleared to return and did not miss an offensive snap in Week 16.

The expectation is that the injury will not impact Allen's availability for Week 17 against the Philadelphia Eagles.

However, McDermott is unsure if the injury will impact Allen's practice reps leading up to the game.

""Don't know yet, there's a chance it does. We'll see. We're going to practice a little bit tomorrow (Tuesday),"" he said. ""We'll see how Josh shows up tomorrow and how he's feeling.""

LB Shaq Thompson (neck), S Jordan Poyer (hamstring) and DT DaQuan Jones (calf) are all also listed as day-to-day.

With Christmas on Thursday, the Bills will be shifting their weekly schedule and holding their first practice of the week on Tuesday, typically a player off day. The Bills will then have Christmas Day off and hold the other two practices Wednesday and Friday.

PRACTICE SQUAD QB SIGNED TO CHIEFS ROSTER

Bills QB Shane Buechele was signed off the team's practice squad and onto the Kansas City Chiefs' active roster Monday afternoon. With Patrick Mahomes out with an ACL injury and backup Gardner Minshew injuring his knee on Sunday against Tennessee, Kansas City was in need of another QB for Week 17.

NFL teams are permitted to sign unprotected players off another team's practice squad under the condition that they are signed directly to the active roster. Teams are allowed to protect a maximum of 4 players on their practice squad from being signed elsewhere.

In this case, Buechele will now join the Chiefs' 53-man roster and could suit up as soon as Christmas Day when Kansas City hosts the Denver Broncos.

Buechele has been with the Bills since the start of the 2023 season, but was with the Chiefs (2021-22) for two seasons prior. Buechele has not attempted a regular pass in the NFL, but could be in line to do so with the Chiefs.

""More than anything, I'm happy for Shane. He and his family, they've been with us and done a phenomenal job. I have a ton of respect and love and admiration for Shane,"" McDermott shared.

McDermott added that ""we'll look into"" whether or not Buffalo wants to add another QB back to its practice squad this week.

FIRST THOUGHTS ON NEW VETERAN EDGE RUSHER

The Bills made an addition to their practice squad late last week, signing veteran DE Matthew Judon.

Judon has 72 career sacks since coming into the league in 2016 and the Bills are excited to get a player with as much experience as he has late in the season.

""We'll take a look at him this week and see where he's at and get him acclimated to kind of the way we do things and rock and roll from there,"" said DC Bobby Babich.

McDermott added that the Bills have a high ""level of respect"" for Judon and his career accomplishments.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bills/x6xjio7ztocdq11aqgge,N,,2025-12-22 19:03:30.013694

In addition to the Patriots clinching a playoff spot, a main headline from this matchup was Ravens star quarterback Lamar Jackson exiting in the second quarter with a back injury and not returning.

On Monday, Ravens coach John Harbaugh told reporters that Jackson has a back contusion -- or a bruise.

""Painful, certainly,"" Harbaugh said. ""Saw him in here getting treatment this morning and this afternoon, early. He's been classified as day-to-day on that, nothing beyond the contusion but I don't want to minimize the severity and pain level of that, because it's legit.""

Jackson struggled to walk out of the locker room after speaking with reporters, according to the Ravens' official website. The two-time MVP was injured on a designed run when he took a knee to the back from Patriots safety Craig Woodson. After the game, Jackson admitted his frustrations about being unable to re-enter the game.

""It's BS, bro,"" Jackson said. ""I can't control that. I'm on the ground. I'm down. I gave myself up. I got kneed in the back. ... [I'm] getting injured, and then we're fighting for a chance to make the playoffs. I can't finish the game with my guys. It's BS.""

Jackson said that he felt like the game was in the Ravens' favor when he got hurt. Jackson had completed 7 of 10 passes for 101 yards before exiting. He was injured right before the Ravens tied the game 10-10 with a field goal with 1:03 remaining in the first half. Tyler Huntley replaced Jackson under center, and completed 9 of 10 passes for 65 yards. Baltimore had a 24-13 lead early in the fourth quarter before the Patriots stormed back to win with two touchdowns in the final nine minutes.

""My legs felt great. I just got kneed in the back in the red zone. I just couldn't finish the game. I was trying. I [got] a Toradol shot and stuff like that, but it still didn't get [any] better,"" Jackson said. ""Pain. It hurts. [It] hurts.""

More tests will be completed, but Jackson hopes to start against the Green Bay Packers next Saturday in what is a must-win game for Baltimore. Even if Jackson starts, the Ravens haven't looked like the offensive juggernaut the NFL world has come to know in recent years. Jackson has accounted for just nine total touchdowns and seven turnovers while averaging 21.8 rushing yards per contest over the past eight games while dealing with an array of injuries. This season marks the first time Jackson has lost six games as a starter -- and Sunday marked his first career loss in Week 15 or later.

Almost as soon as he threw the ball, Nix was distraught, slamming his helmet into the Empower Field turf, as trainers and medical professionals carefully loaded Bryant onto the cart. Nix took accountability for his throw. ""I feel responsible because I threw it, and you can say it's part of the game, but you just never wanna see it,"" said Nix postgame.

The best thing you can do at this point if you endure an injury to a starter is weigh all your options and be vigilant on the waiver wire. It was another rough week in terms of injuries to some key players, so let's go over everything from Week 16 and look ahead to Week 17 — likely your fantasy title matchup.

Lamar Jackson, QB, Ravens (back): Jackson was unable to play in the second half of Sunday night's loss to the Patriots. He's considered day-to-day with a back contusion but is hopeful to play on Saturday vs. the Packers, per NFL Network. This is big going into the fantasy championship round. Jackson would be up against a tough Green Bay defense and is pretty banged up. Plus, he hadn't been instilling much confidence in fantasy managers lately, scoring fewer than 20 fantasy points in five of the past six games. Monitor his practices this week but know Jackson is a risky option at QB. If he can't go, it would be Tyler Huntley starting.

Josh Allen, QB, Bills (foot): Allen is considered day-to-day, per head coach Sean McDermott. It doesn't appear Allen is in danger of missing Week 17 vs. the Eagles on Sunday but this news will be worth monitoring. Buffalo still has an outside shot at winning the AFC East and there are seeding implications. Allen is coming off his worst fantasy output since 2018, when he was a rookie, scoring just 6.9 fantasy points against the Browns in Week 16.

TreVeyon Henderson, RB, Patriots (head): Henderson sustained a head injury early in Sunday night's win over the Ravens. As a result, Rhamondre Stevenson got 10 touches and totaled 78 yards with a touchdown. It's a tough spot for Henderson managers who were just seeing his potential in the second half of the schedule. If Henderson is unable to to play in Week 17, Stevenson becomes an appealing RB2 play in a smash spot against the Jets. Remember, the Patriots are still vying for the AFC East title with the Bills and jockeying for playoff seeding in the conference.

Quinshon Judkins, RB, Browns (leg/knee): The Browns rookie RB suffered an injury no one should have to suffer. Not only did Judkins break his leg, but also sustained a dislocated ankle. With his season over, you may be down a starting RB for your title game. Raheim Sanders had 11 carries for 42 yards, while Trayveon Williams had four catches for 38 yards on Sunday against the Bills. If Dylan Sampson (hand/calf) can get healthy for Week 17, he could lead the backfield against the Steelers. It will be tough to trust any of these backs with a title on the line.

Jordan Love, QB, Packers (concussion): Love exited Week 16 early against the Bears due to a concussion. He'll end up in concussion protocol and it's unclear if he'll be ready for Week 17 against the Ravens on Saturday night. Malik Willis had 121 yards and a TD plus 44 rushing yards in relief, but he's also dealing with a shoulder injury and could miss the Baltimore game. Head coach Matt LaFleur told reporters Sunday that Josh Jacobs and Jayden Reed are emergency QBs. You'd think someone will get promoted from the practice squad or signed; Clayton Tune the likely candidate. We'll be monitoring this situation closely this week.

J.J. McCarthy, QB, Vikings (hand): McCarthy was forced to exit Sunday's win over the Giants due to a hand injury and was replaced by Max Brosmer. McCarthy's X-Rays came back negative and the QB is considered day-to-day. The Vikings have a short week, facing the Lions on Christmas Day on Thursday.

Davante Adams, WR, Rams (hamstring): Adams missed TNF against the Seahawks in Week 16 but will have a chance to get back on the field with additional rest with the Rams facing the Falcons on MNF in Week 17. With Adams out, Puka Nacua went off for a 12-225-2 line while L.A.'s three TEs were heavily involved. If Adams can get back on the field, it's a great spot for the fantasy championship. If Adams remains out, Nacua could see another 15+ targets.

Rashee Rice, WR, Chiefs (concussion): Rice was a late addition to the injury report prior to Week 16 and was inactive. The Chiefs are now down Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew at QB (seemingly both to torn ACLs). It looks like K.C. is going to start Chris Oladokun at QB the rest of the way, which doesn't bode well for the passing game. Even if Rice can get back, it's going to be tough to trust him in a title game against the Broncos.

Jordan Mason, RB, Vikings (ankle): Mason left early vs. the Giants in Week 16 and Aaron Jones Sr. took over the backfield. Mason finished with three touches and that resulted in Jones getting 23 for a total of 93 yards. If Mason is out on Thursday against Detroit, Jones gets a boost in fantasy value for the final round.

Just three days ago, Higgins was flying to Pittsburgh to meet with one of the top concussion specialists in the NFL.
Higgins suffered a concussion on Nov. 23 against New England and, consequently, was inactive the following Thursday against Baltimore.
That’s why the Bengals shouldn’t have one iota of regret about paying Higgins.
The entire show is built around Burrow, Chase and Higgins.","MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The laughs echoed down the tunnels outside the visitors’ locker room. The Cincinnati Bengals sent a reminder of what their offense and team can look like playing to their full potential. The tunnel between the field and locker room inside Hard Rock Stadium featured Ja’Marr Chase loudly joking with team vice president Paul Brown. Coach Zac Taylor shared a story with Mike Gesicki about his touchdown pass while chatting in a doorway.

Then there was the wide, bright smile of Tee Higgins.

The 26-year-old cheat code, who posted two more contested catches on the head of 5-foot-11 cornerback Jack Jones on Sunday, just set off the Bengals’ bittersweet offensive symphony.

“There was a lot of laughs and jokes on the sideline,” Higgins said. “That’s all you can ask for.”

In fact, it’s all he prayed for.

His contagious smile came from a different place than many others this week. Just three days ago, Higgins was flying to Pittsburgh to meet with one of the top concussion specialists in the NFL. The decision came with advice from the Bengals’ front office that their star receiver gain the highest level of expertise about what to do with a series of concussions that turned an ugly year on the field for the Bengals into a scary one off of it for Higgins.

There’s no real preparation for sitting on a flight to find out if your brain is OK.

“Obviously, I was very anxious and nervous about what they were going to say,” Higgins admitted, speaking on what went through his head on the trip. “Honestly, praying I come here and get positive news and come back with positive news to tell the team.”

He eventually got just that and something else.

“I got peace of mind,” he said.

Higgins suffered a concussion on Nov. 23 against New England and, consequently, was inactive the following Thursday against Baltimore. He returned the next game in Buffalo, where he banged his head on the turf twice, passed tests in the blue tent twice in that game to return, only to feel symptoms after the game and go back into concussion protocol. He then missed last week’s game against Baltimore at home before taking the trip to see the specialist.

He suffered through headaches and sensitivity to light in recent weeks as he recovered.

“It’s been a tough road,” he said.

In addition to being cleared by the specialist, Higgins played with a new helmet for the first time Sunday. He said it showed up just in time to wear in the win against the Dolphins. The helmet comes with more padding and didn’t elicit any complaints from Higgins.

He certainly looked comfortable.

There he was, rising into the hot South Florida air, pulling down a 35-yard reception and a 9-yard touchdown pass to set the tone for the day.

He didn’t have to do any of this. The Bengals are 5-10 and eliminated from the postseason. Not a soul in the organization or locker room would have faulted him if he called this a season and didn’t worry about playing out the string, given what’s been going through his head.

Yet, what’s actually been going through his head was being a part of a day like Sunday, meaningless in the standings, but not in Higgins’ world.

“I’m a competitor, man,” Higgins said. “End of the day, I’m a competitor. I want to compete with my guys. That’s all it came down to.”

Higgins isn’t taking concussions lightly. The lengths he’s gone to ensure safety illustrate that. He spoke at length about the importance of anyone with concussion symptoms to step forward and report them, no matter what. This is not a young man without perspective.

He merely understands the importance of his presence and what team players do. They support their team. They take the field.

That’s why the Bengals shouldn’t have one iota of regret about paying Higgins. They need more players like him. Players who prove dedication to the team with actions and not words. In his case, his actions on the field change the entire dynamic of the Bengals’ offense.

Joe Burrow, on a day he went 25-of-32 passing for 309 yards and four touchdowns, witnessed it firsthand.

“That’s why Tee is who he is and why we value him so much; he just makes plays like that,” Burrow said. “They were pressuring a little bit early, and Tee makes those two plays, and then they can’t pressure as much. When they do, they have to play different coverages behind it, so that lets us get the ball out quickly in space. So it just started with those two for Tee … I think they had a plan, and then those two plays happened and they had to change their plan.”

There were many reasons the Bengals offense struggled in the two games without Higgins since Burrow came back and looked unstoppable in the two he’s played. He has always been the wild card that defensive coordinators can’t counter. There’s a demoralizing nature to watching him pluck explosive plays out of the air, no matter the coverage.

The Bengals know that. The entire show is built around Burrow, Chase and Higgins. On Sunday, those two set up the counter of Chase Brown running routes underneath, then drew coverage away on Gesicki’s touchdown up the seam. They kept light boxes for efficiency in the running game.

That’s how a team rips off 45 points in a little over three quarters.

“Offense was at full power today,” Higgins said. “We had everybody. You see what we can do when we have everybody together.”

The Bengals posted a gaudy 0.18 EPA/play the last two seasons on plays with Burrow, Chase and Higgins on the field together. For reference, the league leader over the last two years is the Bills at 0.14, and the league average is 0.00.

This trio, their connection and their mentality make everything work. Availability has been the only thing missing.

“He’s a soldier,” Chase said. “End of the day, I’m one of the guys that is going to make sure that I am picking him up and making sure he is ready to battle. We are both looking out for each other.”

They are all better together, as evidenced by Sunday’s output. Higgins went through an emotional journey to be part of it, so nobody was surprised to see that smile on his face. You’d better believe he was going to enjoy it.

“It was so fun out there,” Higgins said. “That’s all you can ask for. The game is fun.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/21200853/GettyImages-2253018056-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-22 18:04:34.080371

That's especially true this week, as we have a tripleheader on Christmas Day and two more games on Saturday ahead of the usual Sunday slate. And we only have two weeks of regular-season action remaining, making every bit of news all the more consequential.

Who's hurt? Who's practicing? Who's starting? Who's on the hot seat?

Here's the latest on what's happening around the league entering Week 17:

Ravens HC Harbaugh discusses future

The 2025 season has been challenging for the Baltmore Ravens and head coach John Harbaugh, with the team's latest setback coming in a narrow 28-24 Week 16 home loss to the Patriots.

On Monday, Harbaugh addressed questions regarding his job security for the first time this year with Baltimore (7-8) on the verge of missing the postseason. The longtime coach was open and honest about his outlook on the future, noting that he's only focused on the present and finishing each season strong.

""There’s no such thing as, like, ‘your job’ or ‘my job.' We have responsibilities, we’re given opportunities to steward those responsibilities when you’re given a job to do that, until you’re not,"" Harbaugh told reporters. ""I try to do the job, not try to keep the job. Because there’s no such thing as having a job — just doing a job.

""And so my focus is on always — it has been for the last 18 years here and the last 41 years in coaching — it’s been to try to do the best job I can today and fight as hard as I can, so the guys have the best chance to be successful today. And anything after today, I’m not thinking about, because it’s not given for us to think about. We don’t have control over that, except for the job we do today. If we do a good enough job today, then the opportunity to do that job or a different job will be there tomorrow. And that’s what you hope for.""

The Ravens are 179-112 in the regular season, with a 13-11 playoff record, since Harbaugh took the job in 2008. Harbaugh's Ravens will have the final two games to keep up with the first-place Steelers (9-6) in the NFC North. If they fall short, the questions will likely linger with the 2012 Super Bowl champion and former AP NFL Coach of the Year under contract through the 2028 season.

Latest on Lamar Jackson's back injury

The Ravens' playoff hopes are on thin ice, and they might not have their quarterback available when their season is on the line against the Packers on Saturday. Lamar Jackson will undergo an MRI on Monday after suffering a back injury that forced him to miss the second half of Baltimore's loss to New England, but he's hopeful he can play in Week 17.

""Yeah, that's the goal,"" Jackson told reporters. ""We're going to do a little [MRI] scan [Monday] and then see what it shows.""

Ravens head coach John Harbaugh later said that Jackson was dealing with ""a bruise of some kind.""

""I don't know how serious it'll be,"" Harbaugh said. ""We'll have to find out over the next couple of days.""

The Ravens must win each of their final two games and for the Steelers to lose at the Browns in Week 17 in order to make the postseason. At 7-8, winning the AFC North is the only way for Baltimore to make the playoffs for a fourth straight year.

Minshew's ACL intact, Chiefs sign QB Buechele

A week after losing star quarterback Patrick Mahomes for the remainder of the 2025 season with an ACL tear, the team feared that Gardner Minshew suffered the same injury that caused him to leave their loss to the Titans early on Sunday, ESPN reported. While Minshew's ACL turned out to be intact, he did suffer an injury all the same, and is expected to miss time, per ESPN. In response, the Chiefs have signed QB Shane Buechele.

Now, third-string Chris Oladokun is possibly in line to start in Thursday's game against the Broncos, as Minshew recovers and Buechele acclimates himself to the Chiefs. The fourth-year quarterback threw his first career pass in Sunday's loss to the Titans.

Buechele has never appeared in an NFL game, as his career in the league to this point has mostly been being waived and re-signed by the Buffalo Bills as part of their practice squad. The 27-year-old – Buechele turns 28 in early January – played quarterback in college for Texas and SMU from 2016 through 2020. His best season came as a junior with SMU, when he lead the American Conference with 34 touchdowns, 307 completions and 302.2 passing yards per game.

Derick Hall's suspension upheld

Seattle Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall had his one-game suspension for unnecessary roughness and unsportsmanlike conduct upheld on Monday. Hall was suspended without pay for stepping on the leg of Los Angeles Rams guard Kevin Dotson at the end of a play in the Seahawks' 38-37 overtime win on Thursday night.

Hearing officer Ramon Foster, jointly appointed by the NFL and the NFLPA, upheld the suspension that was announced Friday. The NFL said Hall, 24, was in violation of Rule 12, Section 2, Article 8, which prohibits unnecessary roughness and Rule 12, Section 3, Article 1, which applies to unsportsmanlike conduct, including ""any act which is contrary to the generally understood principles of sportsmanship.""

Hall will be eligible to return on Dec. 29, a day after Seattle’s game against the Carolina Panthers.

The third-year pro out of Auburn was selected 37th by the Seahawks in the 2023 NFL draft. He has appeared in 13 games and started three for Seattle this season. He has 29 total tackles and one sack.

Packers monitoring health of both QBs ahead of Ravens matchup

As for who the Ravens' Week 17 opponent, the Packers might also be shorthanded at quarterback for Saturday's game. Jordan Love left Saturday's loss to the Bears early after entering the league's concussion protocol, while backup Malik Willis hurt his throwing shoulder in the fourth quarter. Willis remained in the game, but he was fighting through some pain after the game.

""I'd say he's pretty sore,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur told reporters of Willis on Sunday. ""That's a legitimate deal that he's dealing with, and he's going to be another guy that we'll see where he's at as we progress. That further complicates the other problem.""

Love, meanwhile, will have to spend the week clearing concussion protocol in order to play on Saturday.

""That's a process that takes multiple days to get through,"" LaFleur told reporters.

The Packers fell to 9-5-1 with Saturday's loss, putting their hopes of winning the NFC North in peril. They'll need to win out and for the Bears to lose their final two games in order to win the division. Green Bay also hasn't clinched a playoff spot yet. However, it'll make the playoffs if it wins one of its final two games or if the Lions lose once in the final two weeks.

Jets to start rookie Brady Cook at QB for final two games

The Jets are sticking with Brady Cook at quarterback for the rest of the 2025 regular season, head coach Aaron Glenn told reporters on Monday. With the Jets starting Cook for the final two games, the undrafted rookie could play a big role in the AFC East race as the Jets take on the Patriots and Bills in Weeks 17 and 18, respectively.

Cook has started the last two games for the Jets following Tyrod Taylor's injury. He's thrown for 527 yards, a touchdown and six interceptions over the three games he's played this season.

Commanders sign practice squad QB amid Marcus Mariota uncertainty

The Commanders have signed quarterback Jeff Driskel off the Cardinals' practice squad, the team announced Monday. The move might be an indication that Marcus Mariota won't be able to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys after leaving Saturday's game against the Eagles early with injuries to his throwing hand and quad.

If Mariota can't go, journeyman quarterback Joshua Johnson would be in line to start against the Cowboys.

The Buffalo Bills escaped the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, but the win came with injuries to several veteran contributors signed in the offseason on one-year deals.

Linebacker Shaq Thompson, 31, exited early with a neck injury and safety Jordan Poyer, 34, suffered a hamstring injury late in the fourth quarter. Kicker Matt Prater, 41, missed his first game of the year with a quadriceps injury, and defensive tackle Jordan Phillips, 33, was sidelined with an ankle injury.

With Thompson out, the Browns ran for 160 yards at 5.2 yards per carry despite being without their top two rookie running backs. Quinshon Jenkins was carted off in the second quarter with a fractured fibula and dislocated ankle, and Dylan Sampson was inactive due to a hand injury.

Prater was unavailable after suffering the quad injury in Week 15, prompting the Bills to sign Michael Badgley as a replacement. Badgley missed an extra point and failed to reach the landing zone on one kickoff.

The Bills (11–4) host the Philadelphia Eagles (10–5) at 4:25 p.m. Sunday.

NFL teams have to submit a report on practice participation on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for a Sunday game. There are three levels of practice participation that can be designated: did not participate, limited participation and full participation.

A game status report is due by 4 p.m. Friday for Sunday games.

Here is the Bills vs. Eagles injury report for Week 17:

Buffalo Bills injury update for Week 17

""Just tweaked my foot a little bit,"" Allen said in his postgame press conference. ""Just flamed up on me a little bit. Pain subsided, so we're good.""

Allen was asked by CBS sideline report Evan Washburn how his foot felt after the game.

""We're gravy, baby,"" Allen smiled. ""It's all good. Go Bills.""

He went into the blue medical tent and the locker room for further evaluation and did not return. Phillips had a boot on his right foot in the locker room after the game.

The 11-year veteran has nine tackles and one sack in 10 games in 2025.

Buffalo Bills injured reserve

Landon Jackson, DE, knee

Landon Jackson was injured on his second defensive snap against the Dolphins in Week 10.

The rookie third-round pick came off the left edge on a run by Ollie Gordon and fought off a block before falling backward. He immediately brought his right knee to his chest and grabbed it in pain and trainers evaluated him on the field.

Jackson was ruled out for the game shortly after. He returned to the Bills sideline in the second half with a brace on his right knee and using crutches.

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Jackson is out for the rest of the season.

Ed Oliver, DT, biceps

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

New Orleans linebacker Nephi Sewell crashed into Johnston’s left leg and was flagged for a roughing the kicker penalty. Johnston, 33, immediately slammed his helmet to the turf in frustration before hobbling off with trainers.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead.

He finished 3 of 8 passing for 15 yards before heading to the locker room early in the second quarter.
Reports surfaced after the game that Minshew likely tore his ACL.
• Marcus Harris (Idaho), a rookie cornerback for Tennessee, exited in the second quarter with a knee injury and did not return.
Thompson, an 85-game starter over the past seven years with the Cardinals, started the first 13 games of this season before suffering the injury.","Cam Ward had arguably his best game of the year. Gardner Minshew had one of the most unfortunate days of his career.

Sunday’s matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and Tennessee Titans pitted former Washington State quarterbacks against each other. The rookie for Tennessee looked sharp, guiding his team to a 26-9 home win over the Chiefs. On the other side, Minshew’s day ended early due to a serious injury.

The veteran quarterback was filling in for star Patrick Mahomes, who tore his ACL last week during a loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. Minshew scrambled on the third play of the game against Tennessee and fell with what appeared to be a noncontact injury. He grabbed at his left knee and hobbled after he got to his feet.

Minshew attempted to stay in the game, but looked uncomfortable. He finished 3 of 8 passing for 15 yards before heading to the locker room early in the second quarter. Reports surfaced after the game that Minshew likely tore his ACL.

A seventh-year pro in his first season with the Chiefs, Minshew was making his 47th career start and first since last season, when he started nine games for Las Vegas before suffering a season-ending shoulder injury.

WSU fans were no doubt eager to see the program legend, a show-stealing phenomenon during the Cougs’ 11-win season in 2018, get his opportunity to reintroduce “Minshew Mania” on the NFL stage and square off with a young QB who also made his name on the Palouse.

After Minshew went down, Ward captured the spotlight. He completed 21 of 28 passes for 228 yards and two touchdowns with no turnovers, picking up his third NFL win with his most efficient passing performance of the season. Ward was Pro Football Focus’ highest-graded player of the game (80.3).

Ward led long scoring drives late in the second quarter and early in the third, capping them with short TD passes, to put Tennessee up 16-6. He connected with Elic Ayomanor for a key 24-yard gain on a third down early in the fourth to set up a rushing touchdown that extended the Titans’ lead to 23-9 and effectively put the game away.

Ward, who became an NFL prospect during his time at WSU (2022-23) before finishing his career at Miami, has shown some promise while toiling through a difficult rookie season. The No. 1 overall draft pick has thrown for 2,866 yards and 13 touchdowns with seven interceptions on a 60.2% completion rate. He’s taken 51 sacks, second most in the league.

Sunday’s matchup was the first NFL game to feature former Cougars starting at QB on both sides since 1992, when a Mark Rypien-led Washington team beat Timm Rosenbach’s Phoenix Cardinals.

• Jaylen Watson (WSU), a starting cornerback for Kansas City, recorded two stops in the run game, but allowed a couple of big receptions.

Watson finished with seven tackles (three solo), assisting on a tackle for loss early in the fourth quarter and making a tackle to limit a run play to 2 yards on that same drive. Moments later, he surrendered a 24-yard reception to Ayomanor, who also caught a 25-yarder on Watson earlier in the game.

For the season, Watson has a career-high 64 tackles, two interceptions and two sacks. The fourth-year pro, a seventh-round draft pick in 2022, has started every game this season.

• Jaden Hicks (WSU) appeared on 17 defensive snaps off the bench for the Chiefs at strong safety, per PFF, and recorded four tackles.

Two of his stops came at the line of scrimmage. The second-year pro allowed two catches for 24 yards.

• Marcus Harris (Idaho), a rookie cornerback for Tennessee, exited in the second quarter with a knee injury and did not return.

A sixth-round draft pick this year, Harris had started the past four games, carving out a key role at the nickel corner position. He played 16 snaps Sunday before the injury, logging one tackle. Harris didn’t allow a catch.

• Kyle Williams (WSU), a rookie receiver for New England, caught a momentum-swinging touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter, helping the Patriots rally to a 28-24 win over Baltimore.

Williams beat his defender off the line on a vertical route and hauled in a high-arching pass just inside the pylon for a 37-yard touchdown, his third scoring catch as a pro.

Williams finished with 46 yards on two catches and totaled 89 yards on three kick returns with a long of 36 yards.

• Christian Elliss (Idaho), an inside linebacker for the Patriots, registered five tackles.

The fifth-year pro made his 11th start in 13 games this season. Elliss ranks second on the team with 81 tackles.

• Daiyan Henley (WSU), an inside linebacker for the Los Angeles Chargers, totaled six tackles (four solo) during their 34-17 win over Dallas.

Henley surrendered four catches on short routes for 40 yards, per PFF.

The third-year pro, an L.A. team captain, leads the Chargers this season with 92 tackles.

• Chau Smith-Wade (WSU), a cornerback for Carolina, came off the bench to play in 50 of 64 defensive snaps at the nickel position during the Panthers’ 23-20 win over Tampa Bay.

Smith-Wade, a fifth-round draft pick in 2024, finished with five tackles (three solo). He gave up three catches for 23 yards, according to a PFF report, but Smith-Wade also appeared to be responsible for Emeka Egbuka getting open for a 40-yard reception in the fourth quarter.

• Kaden Elliss (Idaho), a captain at linebacker for Atlanta, tallied four tackles (one solo) during the Falcons’ 26-19 win over Arizona.

The seventh-year vet has a team-high 98 tackles on the season.

• Ryan Rehkow (Central Valley) averaged 52 yards on four punts for Cincinnati during its 45-21 win over Miami.

The BYU grad, the NFL’s leader in punting average (51.3), placed each of his punts inside the Dolphins’ 20-yard line.

• Jalen Thompson (WSU), a longtime starter at strong safety for Arizona, missed his second game in a row as he recovers from a hamstring injury.

After a frightening hit late in the game, Bryant was immobilized and carted off the field.

His neck was stabilized, leaving teammates and fans anxiously awaiting an update.

After several tense hours of uncertainty, the news that followed brought widespread relief.

ESPN noted that Bryant was discharged from the hospital after suffering a concussion, but he avoided any serious or long-term injury.

Sources told ESPN that the rookie was cleared of neck and neurological injuries after undergoing testing.

Doctors diagnosed a concussion and nothing more.

9NEWS’ Mike Klis added that Bryant had movement in his hands and legs, an enormous relief after a moment that left both sidelines and the entire NFL community shaken.

“You never want to see somebody in that situation, and I feel responsible because I threw it,” Broncos quarterback Bo Nix said after the game.

“You can say it’s part of the game, but you just never want to see it. I really pray he’s OK.”

A Frightening Scene Late Against Jacksonville

Bryant’s injury occurred with just 41 seconds remaining in Denver’s 34-20 loss.

Nix delivered an 11-yard completion over the middle, where Bryant was met by Jaguars cornerback Montaric Brown.

The collision immediately stopped the game.

Bryant stayed down as trainers rushed onto the field, players from both teams took a knee, and his facemask was removed.

He was immobilized on a backboard, carted off the field, and later transported to a local hospital by ambulance.

Officials ruled the hit legal, with referee Shawn Hochuli explaining the contact was not to the head or neck area.

“Obviously very scary,” Broncos tackle Mike McGlinchey said afterward.

Courtland Sutton echoed that sentiment:

“You never want to see one of your brothers go down,” Sutton said.“He plays with great effort and great character. He’s a great dude.”

What Comes Next for Bryant and the Broncos

Now comes the recovery process.

Bryant will enter the NFL’s concussion protocol.

His future availability dependent on how quickly he progresses through the stages.

Head coach Sean Payton said after the game that Bryant had movement in all extremities, a crucial sign that he avoided a serious injury.

Given the circumstances, the Broncos will take a cautious approach, prioritizing Bryant’s health over any short-term availability.

Denver travels to face the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night in four days, so it is almost certain that Bryant will miss that game.

But the main focus remains on Bryant’s long-term well-being.

It was a huge relief that he escaped with only a concussion and avoided any career-altering injury.

After one of the scariest moments of Denver’s season, we can all now take one big sigh of relief.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2253055208_4b30ad.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-22 18:05:08.803272

Robinson had 92 yards receiving on seven catches, including a 13-yard touchdown, and added 76 yards rushing on 16 carries.","The Pittsburgh Steelers pushed the Detroit Lions to the brink of elimination from the playoffs on Sunday, holding on for a 29-24 win when Jared Goff’s touchdown on the final play was negated by an offensive pass-interference penalty on Amon-Ra St Brown.

Goff threw a fourth-down pass to St Brown just short of the goal line. The receiver pushed off cornerback Jalen Ramsey to get free, and before the Steelers could bring St Brown to the ground, he threw the quarterback a lateral to set up an apparent score.

Officials huddled for some time on the field before announcing the decision to the dismay of the crowd.

Jaylen Warren had two 45-yard touchdown runs in the fourth quarter and finished with a career-high 143 yards for the Steelers, who had a 230-15 advantage in rushing yards.

The AFC North-leading Steelers (9-6) have won three straight after a midseason slump, surging into the division lead with two games remaining.

Kansas City Chiefs 9-26 Tennessee Titans

Cam Ward threw for 228 yards and two touchdowns, and the Tennessee Titans snapped an 11-game home skid by beating the Kansas City Chiefs 26-9 on Sunday.

The Titans (3-12) improved to 1-7 at home this season with their first win at Nissan Stadium since 3 November 2024. The skid matched the franchise’s worst since moving to Tennessee in 1997.

With two games left, the Chiefs (6-9) are assured of their first losing record since 2012 – their most recent season without Andy Reid as their coach. Kansas City have lost four straight, their longest skid since 2017, and six of seven.

A week after Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a season-ending torn ACL, his backup, Gardner Minshew, was knocked out of the game with a knee injury early in the second quarter.

Ward posted his highest passer rating of this season at 122.3, and he overtook Marcus Mariota for the most yards passing by a rookie for the franchise. He helped the Titans roll up a season-high 377 yards of offense against a Chiefs defense that came in as the NFL’s eighth-stingiest in yards allowed.

The rookie threw a shovel pass to Chig Okonkwo that went seven yards to put the Titans ahead to stay late in the first half. Ward also found fellow rookie Chimere Dike for a 1-yard TD in the third quarter.

Minnesota Vikings 16-13 New York Giants

JJ McCarthy ran for a touchdown before leaving with an injury to his right, throwing hand, and backup quarterback Max Brosmer helped the Minnesota Vikings win their third game in a row, beating the New York Giants 16-13 on Sunday in a matchup of teams eliminated from playoff contention.

McCarthy was injured on a strip sack by Brian Burns in the final minute of the first half, when it appeared the Vikings (7-8) were going to let the clock run out. Instead, Burns forced McCarthy to fumble with a crushing hit and Tyler Nubin returned it 27 yards for a touchdown.

Brosmer led a go-ahead scoring drive in the fourth quarter that ended with Will Reichard making a 30-yard field goal. The rookie completed 7 of 9 passes for 52 yards in his fourth NFL appearance and first since throwing four interceptions 30 November in a 26-0 loss at Seattle.

Before getting hurt, McCarthy completed 9 of 14 passes for 108 yards and had a would-be pick-6 negated by an offside penalty on Abdul Carter. After having his entire rookie year wiped out by a torn meniscus in his right knee, the 2024 No 10 pick has missed time this season because of a concussion and a sprained right ankle.

The Giants (2-13) lost their ninth consecutive game and fifth since Mike Kafka took over as interim coach when Brian Daboll was fired on 10 November. They have not won since 9 October.

Los Angeles Chargers 34-17 Dallas Cowboys

Justin Herbert threw two touchdown passes and ran for a score and the Los Angeles Chargers closed in on a playoff spot with a 34-17 victory over the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.

The Chargers’ fourth consecutive victory gave them a chance later in the day to clinch their second postseason berth in two seasons under coach Jim Harbaugh. LA (11-4) would be in with a loss or tie by either Indianapolis or Houston.

Dak Prescott had TD passes on his first two drives but couldn’t find the end zone again for Dallas, which was eliminated from the playoffs for the second year in a row with Philadelphia’s NFC East-clinching victory at Washington on Saturday.

The Cowboys (6-8-1) have lost three in a row since a three-game winning streak that put them over .500 for the only time in coach Brian Schottenheimer’s first season.

In his third full game with his broken non-throwing (left) hand heavily protected, Herbert led the Chargers to touchdowns on all three drives in the first half. Omarion Hampton scored on a five-yard run in the second half.

Buffalo Bills 23-20 Cleveland Browns

James Cook rushed for 117 yards and two touchdowns, Josh Allen played through a foot injury and the Buffalo Bills drew closer to a playoff berth with a 23-20 victory over the Cleveland Browns on Sunday.

Ty Johnson also had a rushing score for the Bills (11-4), who have won four straight and five of six.

Allen played the second half despite injuring his right foot during the second quarter.

The reigning NFL MVP was favoring the foot after being sacked by Cleveland’s Myles Garrett and Alex Wright for a 22-yard loss to Buffalo’s one-yard line with 60 seconds remaining in the first half. The half-sack gave Garrett 22 on the season. He needs one more sack in the final two games for the Browns (3-12) to pass Michael Strahan and TJ Watt for the single-season mark.

Allen was 12 of 19 for 130 yards and also rushed for 17 yards on seven carries.

New York Jets 6-29 New Orleans Saints

Chris Olave caught touchdown passes from Tyler Shough and Taysom Hill, Charlie Smyth tied a Saints record with five field goals and New Orleans extended their winning streak to three with a 29-6 victory over the reeling New York Jets on Sunday.

Cameron Jordan had two sacks for New Orleans (5-10), giving him 130 for his career and moving the 15th-year defensive end two ahead of Hall of Famer Rickey Jackson for 17th most in NFL history. Jordan, now with a team-high 8 1/2 sacks this season, has had at least eight sacks in nine seasons.

Shough, drafted 40th overall last spring, passed for 308 yards to eclipse 300 for the first time while improving to 4-3 as a starter. Hill accounted for 116 yards with 42 rushing, 36 receiving and his 38-yard scoring pass to Olave in the final minutes.

Undrafted rookie Brady Cook made his second start with the Jets (3-12), who’ve lost three straight and five of six.

Cook was sacked eight times. He lost a fumble when ex-Jet Nathan Shepherd flattened him and defensive end Chase Young recovered, leading to Smyth’s 50-yard field goal. Cook also was intercepted by rookie safety Jonas Sanker on a fourth-down play in the fourth quarter, leading to Smyth’s final field goal from 39 yards.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20-23 Carolina Panthers

Bryce Young threw for 191 yards and two touchdowns, Lathan Ransom intercepted Baker Mayfield with 42 seconds left and the Carolina Panthers beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 23-20 on Sunday to take over first place in the NFC South.

The Panthers (8-7) can wrap up with the division title next Sunday with a win over Seattle and a Buccaneers (7-8) loss to Miami. However, if both teams win or both teams lose, the Panthers would need to beat Tampa Bay again on the road in Week 18 to claim their first division title since 2015.

Tetairoa McMillan had six catches for 73 yards and a touchdown as the Panthers once again bounced back with a huge win after a potentially devastating loss to the last-place New Orleans Saints.

Ransom had a huge mistake in that defeat with a late hit on Saints QB Tyler Shough that led to New Orleans’ winning field goal.

But with the Bucs driving for a tying field goal – or a go-ahead touchdown – there was a miscommunication on a second-and-9 pass play between Mayfield and Mike Evans at the Carolina 42 and Ransom got an easy pick to seal the win.

Cincinnati Bengals 45-21 Miami Dolphins

Joe Burrow rebounded from his first time being shut out to throw for 309 yards and four touchdowns as the Cincinnati Bengals routed the Miami Dolphins 45-21 on Sunday.

Miami (6-9) and Cincinnati (5-10) were both eliminated from playoff contention last week, but the teams insisted they were still motivated for the final three games of the season.

It appeared that way in the first half. Cincinnati held a 17-14 halftime lead before blowing the game open with 28 points off four straight Dolphins turnovers.

Burrow carved up Miami’s defense, completing 25 of 32 throws with a 146.5 passer rating before being replaced by veteran Joe Flacco early in the fourth quarter. Two of Burrow’s touchdown passes went to running back Chase Brown, from 9 and 5 yards out. Brown, who finished with 66 yards rushing and 43 receiving, also had a 12-yard touchdown run. All of Brown’s TDs came in the third, making him the first player this season with three scores in a single quarter.

Ja’Marr Chase caught nine passes for 109 yards.

Jacksonville Jaguars 34-20 Denver Broncos

Trevor Lawrence threw three touchdown passes and ran for another score, leading the Jacksonville Jaguars to a resounding 34-20 win that snapped the Denver Broncos’ 11-game winning streak Sunday.

The AFC South-leading Jaguars (11-4) won their sixth straight game and handed the Broncos (12-3) their first loss since Week 3. It was also Denver’s first loss at home since 13 October 2024, snapping the Broncos’ 12-game home winning streak.

The Broncos’ lead over the Los Angeles Chargers in the AFC West was sliced to a single game. The teams play in Week 18.

After Broncos rookie RJ Harvey pinballed his way for a 38-yard touchdown to tie it at 17 on the opening drive of the second half, it was all Jacksonville.

Lawrence scored on a on-yard keeper, then hit Parker Washington for 63 yards to set up Travis Etienne Jr’s 10-yard TD catch. After Bo Nix fumbled his exchange with running back Jaleel McLaughlin, Lawrence drove Jacksonville on its fifth consecutive score, a 26-yard field goal by Cam Little that made it 34-17 early in the fourth quarter.

Atlanta Falcons 26-19 Arizona Cardinals

Bijan Robinson gained 171 yards from scrimmage and had a touchdown catch, Kirk Cousins threw two TD passes and ran for a score, and the Atlanta Falcons held on to beat the Arizona Cardinals 26-19 on Sunday.

The Falcons (6-9) won for the second straight week, with both coming on the road.

Arizona’s defense made a fourth-down stop at its own 40-yard line with 2:05 left, setting up a chance to tie the game or take the lead, but Atlanta’s CJ Henderson made a diving interception of Jacoby Brissett’s pass with 1:30 remaining to seal it.

Robinson had 92 yards receiving on seven catches, including a 13-yard touchdown, and added 76 yards rushing on 16 carries. The 23-year-old became the third player in franchise history to gain at least 2,000 yards from scrimmage in a season, joining Jamal Anderson (1998) and William Andrews (1981 and 1983).

Arizona (3-12) has lost seven straight and 12 of 13 since starting the season 2-0.

Las Vegas Raiders 21-23 Houston Texans

CJ Stroud threw a touchdown pass, Derek Stingley returned an interception for a score and the Houston Texans beat Las Vegas 23-21 on Sunday for their seventh straight victory and the Raiders’ ninth loss in a row.

Houston (10-5) has its longest winning streak since a nine-game run in 2018. The Texans remain a game behind first-place Jacksonville – a winner in Denver on Sunday – in the AFC South. The Raiders are 2-13.

Stingley’s touchdown came in the first quarter, and Ka’imi Fairbairn made three field goals to help the Texans to the win on a day when their offense struggled.

Houston led by two with about eight minutes left when Stroud found a wide-open Dalton Schultz for a 1-yard touchdown strike that made it 23-14. Nick Chubb had a 30-yard run on that drive and a 23-yard pass interference call on Lonnie Johnson Jr against Collins got Houston to the 2 to set up the score.

Rauders rookie Ashton Jeanty cut the lead to 23-21 when he scored on a 51-yard run with about five and a half minutes left. The rookie burst through the line before shedding a defender and waltzing into the end zone.

(AP) — Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Gardner Minshew hurt his left knee Sunday in the second quarter against the Tennessee Titans and was ruled out for the rest of the game.

Chris Oladokun replaced Minshew, who was making his first start this season for the Chiefs with Patrick Mahomes on injured reserve after tearing two knee ligaments last week.

Minshew’s last play came on a safety when Titans defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons tackled Kareem Hunt in the end zone with 13:06 left in the second. Minshew finished 3 of 8 for 15 yards before his injury.

When the Chiefs got the ball back, Oladokun, just signed to the roster, took over.

Oladokun handed off on his first five plays. Oladokun wound up throwing away his first pass attempt before finally connecting with Travis Kelce on a 6-yard completion for his first in the NFL. The Chiefs settled for a 54-yard field goal by Harrison Butker for a 3-2 lead.

His only previous NFL regular-season game came Jan. 5 backing up Carson Wentz for the Chiefs in a 38-0 blowout loss to Denver. Oladokun ran once for 5 yards, was sacked once and had a fumble in that loss.

He started at South Florida and also attended Samford and South Dakota State. Pittsburgh drafted Oladokun in 2022 with a seventh-round pick.

Although Vidal left the game and did not return, the injury is not considered serious.

Vidal has appeared in 12 games this season and started 10, recording 631 rushing yards and three touchdowns.

Pittsburgh Steelers wideout DK Metcalf was suspended for two games following a sideline altercation with a fan during the team's 29-24 win over the Detroit Lions in Week 16, the league announced on Monday.

As a result, Metcalf will miss the final two games of the regular season. He is expected to appeal the suspension.

The incident occurred in the second quarter of the contest on Sunday at Ford Field. While the Lions' offense was on the field, Metcalf approached a fan wearing a blue wig and sitting in the front row. After exchanging words with the fan, Metcalf appeared to throw a punch at the fan's head. It was unclear whether the punch connected.

While the incident was captured on the broadcast, it was not seen by officials.

Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is considered day-to-day with a serious contusion in his back, according to head coach John Harbaugh.

""It doesn't look like it's more than that,"" Harbaugh said. ""He's in there getting treatment now.""

Jackson went down late after an awkward slide in the second quarter of Sunday’s 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots. Jackson was 7-10 for 101 yards and rushed for 7 before he went down.

Jackson was replaced by backup quarterback Tyler “Snoop” Huntley. Huntley went 9-10 for 65 yards against the Patriots.

Jackson has battled injuries throughout the season, most notably a hamstring injury, which caused him to miss three games. Jackson’s explosiveness has also been limited. He ran for a career low of 340 yards so far this season.

After Sunday’s loss and Pittsburgh win against the Lions, the Ravens have little margin for error if they want to make the playoffs. The Ravens are 7-8 and are one game behind the Steelers in the AFC North. The Ravens face the Green Packers and the Steelers the next two weeks.

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Gardner Minshew did not tear his ACL, as initially feared in Sunday’s 26-9 loss to the Tennessee Titans, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. Despite the good news for Minshew, he is still expected to miss time.

The Chiefs are now down to their third quarterback after starting quarterback Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers. Chris Oladokun took over for Minshew after he went down.

The Chiefs are also signing quarterback Shane Buechele off the Bills’ practice squad.

The Indianapolis Colts have activated veteran defensive tackle DeForest Buckner from the injured reserve list. This activation comes just before the Colts’ Week 16 Monday Night Football matchup with the San Francisco 49ers.

Buckner has been out with a neck injury since Week 9, and since then, the Colts have fallen out of the playoff picture, currently sitting in eighth place in the AFC at 8-6. The Colts need a win to keep pace, especially since Jacksonville and Houston won on Sunday and remain ahead of them in the AFC South.

The NFL will investigate Pittsburgh Steelers’ wide receiver D.K. Metcalf’s sideline interaction with a fan during Sunday’s game, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network.

During the contest, Metcalf confronted, and may have thrown a punch at a fan on the sideline. The league will look into exactly what happened, and could punish Metcalf for his actions.

That punishment could come as early as Monday evening, per Rapoport. Given the nature of the confrontation, Metcalf could be looking at a possible suspension.

Baltimore Ravens star Lamar Jackson’s status is “up in the air” for Week 17, per NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.

Jackson had to leave Sunday’s game due to a back injury and was unable to return. Whether he can play in Week 17 is unclear right now.

It’s been a frustrating, injury-riddled year for Jackson, who missed time with a hamstring issue earlier in the year.

Denver Broncos wideout Pat Bryant was released from the hospital late Sunday night with a concussion. Bryant sustained the injury in the final minute of the team’s 34-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday.

Bryant took a big hit in the final minute of the game. He was placed on a backboard, taken off the field on a cart and then taken to a local hospital to be evaluated. Tests for a potential neck injury came back negative, per ESPN.

The Broncos are set to play the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas Day.
