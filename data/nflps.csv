While Johnson did not participate, he was out there in his No. 65 jersey and had a helmet too during the brief portion of practice open to reporters. As the rest of his teammates warmed up in the middle of the indoor practice field, Johnson was against the back wall stretching.

Johnson’s presence on Friday appears to be a positive sign for his availability in the Eagles’ wild-card game next weekend at the Linc.

Johnson, 35, has missed the last six games with that injury and backup Fred Johnson has made those starts. Before the injury, Lane Johnson started 10 games and was performing at a very high level. In those 10 starts, Johnson hadn’t surrendered a sack and had been charged with just 7 pressure, per PFF.

Johnson was one of six Eagles' players ruled out for Week 18:

OUT: DT Jalen Carter (hip), LB Nakobe Dean (hamstring), S Marcus Epps (concussion), TE Dallas Goedert (knee), T Lane Johnson (foot), OLB Jaelan Phillips (ankle)

Epps was a late addition to Thursday’s injury report. He reported symptoms to the medical staff after practice and was diagnosed with a concussion. Epps is in the NFL’s concussion protocol.

The Eagles are resting most of their starters in Week 18 so the injury report this week isn’t too much of a concern.

The Panthers have some issues to contend with defensively, especially if Wharton is out in addition to Cherelus. Hunt's potential absence would hurt the running game as well.

Cross' absence will affect the protection in front of Sam Darnold, while Bryant potentially missing the game would affect the coverage on the back end of the defense.

George Kittle seems on the verge of a return for San Francisco. Pearsall played last week despite his injuries. White is one of San Francisco's top pass rushers in the wake of all the injuries the Niners have been dealing with and his potential absence could be a blow on that front.

The Giants are down a pair of starters in the secondary, as well as two of Jaxon Dart's top options in the passing game.

The Bills took Josh Allen off the injury report, but we don't yet know if he'll actually play. They will be down three key defenders and could be without two more players up front. Kincaid missed last week and has been playing through injuries all year.

The Lions are eliminated from the playoffs, and their entire offensive line is banged up entering this game. They also may not have Amon-Ra St. Brown, who has been battling injuries in recent weeks.

The Bears are mostly healthy, though Odunze still seems unlikely to go considering he has just one limited practice under his belt. Trapilo's potential absence could be important at tackle.

The Cardinals are pretty healthy but Sweat's potential absence would obviously affect their pass rush.

The Rams have said that they'll play their healthy starters no matter what happens in the Seahawks-49ers game on Saturday, but here we see that they have listed a bunch of those players as questionable after getting in limited practices during the week, so they could just be inactive for the game depending on the result the night before.

Fitzpatrick's absence will be felt on the back end of the defense. Mike McDaniel said that players who don't practice are unlikely to play, so that applies to Achane. The Dolphins could also be without a pair of starting offensive lineman, their best linebacker, a pass rusher, their kicker and then their No. 1 wide receiver.

The Patriots are missing a few key defenders here but Milton Williams and Will Campbell are off the injury report after upgrading to full practices late in the week. Demario Douglas and Kayshon Boutte will be in action as well.

The Seahawks will play Saturday's game without starting left tackle Charles Cross, who has been ruled out, meaning he will miss a third straight game due to a hamstring injury.
""These guys have done a great job of getting back and working, but obviously Charles isn't going to make it this week.""
""My understanding, it was a good exam right there at the game,"" Macdonald said.
We're with him, he's doing a great job, we're just not going to have him right now.","The Seahawks fly to the Bay Area on Friday ahead of a big Week 18 showdown with the 49ers, which will decide both the NFC West title and the NFC's top seed.

And Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald liked what he saw from his team at practice as they prepared for a game on a short week.

""Guys did a great job,"" he said. ""We're ready to go… The guys did a great job. We were talking about the process and how we wanted to change the calendar a little bit, and the guys were just like, 'Look we'll do whatever, just let us know.' We did, and the guys executed it. I thought we had a great week.""

The Seahawks will play Saturday's game without starting left tackle Charles Cross, who has been ruled out, meaning he will miss a third straight game due to a hamstring injury.

The good news is that there is hope that Cross is back for the Seahawks' first playoff game, which will be in two weeks if they win and earn a bye, or next week if they end up a wild card team.

""We're optimistic for next week or the week after for Charles,"" Macdonald said. ""These guys have done a great job of getting back and working, but obviously Charles isn't going to make it this week.""

Josh Jones, who has started the past two games for Cross, is listed as questionable due to knee and ankle injuries. Jones, who played every offensive snap in last week's win in Carolina, did not practice Tuesday or Wednesday, then was listed as limited on Friday.

Asked directly if Jones would play, Macdonald, who earlier in the week indicated that Jones would be able to play, elected to stick with the injury report, saying, ""It's questionable if he's going to play. He's progressing; the injury report is what it is. We'll stick with it right now.""

If Bryant doesn't play, the most likely outcome with a doubtful designation, then Ty Okada would again start in his place. When it comes to depth, the Seahawks lost safety D'Anthony Bell this week when he was claimed off waivers by the Panthers, so one option could be veteran Quandre Diggs, who signed to the practice squad in November, but has been dealing with a thigh injury (players on the practice squad aren't listed on the injury report).

Asked if Diggs could play this weekend, Macdonald said, ""He could. He's coming back from his injury as well, so we're working through that.""

Receiver Rashid Shaheed, who left last week's game with a concussion, did not have a game status designation, meaning he is ready to play.

""My understanding, it was a good exam right there at the game,"" Macdonald said. ""So I know he's confident on where he's at, feels great, and he's had a good week. I think he's in a good spot.""

Macdonald also provided more clarity on rookie receiver Tory Horton, who has been on injured reserve with a shin injury since November. Unfortunately, Horton is unlikely to play again this year.

""We got some clarification on Tory,"" Macdonald said. ""The best way I can describe it is that what he has, it just takes a long time to heal. Put it this way, we're planning on not having him, and if something happens, which we're not counting on, and he's able to come back, then that's great. But right now, we're planning on not having him. He just needs time and rest. It's unfortunate, but these things happen. We're with him, he's doing a great job, we're just not going to have him right now.

""He should be able to have a full offseason. Who knows how things are going to shake out, how long we go and all that, but right now we're not planning on having him. But not a long-term concern.""

Aside from Horton and receiver Cody White, who was placed on injured reserve this week due to a groin injury, the other players put on IR this season—running back George Holani, tight end Eljah Arroyo and linebacker Chazz Surratt—all have a chance to return in the playoffs.

""Really all those guys with the exception of Tory and Cody I would say at some point would be capable of coming back,"" Macdonald said.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/rah72bsbzcc5hsf0tuoj,N,,2026-01-02 18:58:24.418359

Receiver Dontayvion Wicks (concussion) is doubtful after not practicing this week. The Packers also ruled out receiver Savion Williams (foot/illness), guards Donovan Jennings (throat) and John Williams (back/physically unable to perform), and linebacker Nick Niemann (pectoral/injured reserve).

Quarterback Jordan Love (left shoulder/concussion) did not receive a game status and will be available Sunday, though Head Coach Matt LaFleur told reporters earlier this week the intention is for Love not to play in Minnesota.

With Green Bay locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs, the Packers announced on Thursday that third-string quarterback Clayton Tune will start against the Vikings but have not disclosed who'll serve as his backup.

If Willis isn't available, former Atlanta third-round pick Desmond Ridder could be a possibility after he signed to Green Bay's practice squad on Wednesday.

""He's a guy that we've seen up close and personal,"" said LaFleur of Ridder. ""We played against him when he was in Atlanta and watching what he did in that game, he led them to a win. He's got experience in the system. He's put in the time. … He'll be ready to go if need be.""

Tom, who was limited in practice this week, has been out since injuring his knee against Denver on Dec. 14. Former first-round pick Jordan Morgan started the past two games in Tom's place.

Savion Williams practiced in a limited capacity Wednesday but didn't participate the past two days. The Packers planned for Williams to play against the Ravens before falling ill before the game. Sunday will be the fifth game the rookie third-round pick has missed this season.

""We'd love to get him back,"" said LaFleur of Williams on Thursday. ""He's been pretty hobbled for multiple weeks, and to compound that, last week he was really sick, so there was a lot of factors into that.""

In addition to Love, Green Bay didn't issue a game status for the following players who will be available: running back Josh Jacobs (knee/ankle), guard Aaron Banks (illness/ankle), linebacker Edgerrin Cooper (shoulder), receiver Jayden Reed (illness), defensive lineman Lukas Van Ness (illness/foot).

The Packers listed Jacobs as a full participant on Friday, marking the first time he's practiced in full since a Friday practice in Week 14.

Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy (right hand) isn't carrying a game status and will play Sunday after missing last week's game against Detroit.

While the Bears are getting healthier, the Lions were forced to shut down four of their starters for this game.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

Ruled OUT

RT Penei Sewell (ankle)

IOL Trystan Colon (wrist)

DT Alim McNeill (abdomen)

LB Alex Anzalone (concussion)

SAF Thomas Harper (concussion)

Sewell was unable to practice this week, and coach Dan Campbell hinted at his Friday morning press conference that the All-Pro right tackle might not be available for the season finale:

“I don’t feel great about Sewell right now, but I’m always going to hold out hope. But as far as does it affect you not having him? Yeah, it does. I mean he’s a phenomenal player. He’s a phenomenal football player. Yet, we’ve got guys who are going to step in and do a good job for us. They’ve got a job to do, they’ll have a role and we expect them to hold up their end of the bargain.”

The Lions will most likely turn to veteran Dan Skipper to start at right tackle against the Bears, with reserve Kayode Awosika available in an emergency third offensive tackle role. Giovanni Manu remains a long shot to play in Week 18.

Colon has been dealing with a wrist injury for several weeks now, and while he looked like he was making positive progress in recent games, he was unable to practice this week and will not play in Week 18.

McNeill’s injury popped up ahead of Week 17, then he appeared to reaggravate his abdomen during the game, left early, and hasn’t practiced since. With him ruled out, look for first-round pick Tyleik Williams to see an increased role and quite likely get the start.

Anzalone and Harper were not able to clear the NFL’s concussion protocol, and both have been ruled out. With Anzalone in a contract year, it’s fair to speculate if he has played his last game as a Lion. Harper remains under contract next season.

Questionable

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee/ankle)

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness/rest)

OT Giovanni Manu (knee) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 5

LG Christian Mahogany (illness)

OL Kayode Awosika (illness)

St. Brown wants to play in Week 18, and according to Campbell, things are “trending the right way.” Campbell did leave the door open to possibly holding the start wide receiver out of the finale, but for now, he looks on track to finish out the season in Chicago.

Decker saw two limited practices this week—which is more than most weeks—and appears to be heading towards another start at left tackle.

Manu progressed through his injury evaluation window, and while he could be an option to replace Sewell, Campbell told the media on Friday that it’s unlikely that they activate him for this game, reiterating that his return to practice was more about getting him ready for 2026:

“I don’t see playing him this last one,” Campbell told the media, later adding, “You get football reps, and so those have been good for him. I mean, he looks a lot better than he did three weeks ago when he started, so that’s a good thing. He gets some individual work, some technique work, team work against our defense. So, that always helps.”

Mahogany and Awosika look as if they’ve put their illness behind them and are on track to play against the Bears.

No injury designation

DB Avonte Maddox (back/illness)

Maddox looks to be in a good position to return to game action this week and is expected to step back into a starting role.

Dolphins

S Minkah Fitzpatrick (calf)

New England’s rookie left guard will remain in the NFL’s concussion protocol for a second Sunday in a row. And across the ball, three March signings will stay sidelined until the playoffs. The all-purpose Tonga has not practiced since sustaining a foot injury against the Baltimore Ravens. Knee and ankle injuries have also kept defensive captains shelved off the edges and off the ball.

Landry leads team with 8.5 sacks, 19 quarterback hits and 10 tackles for loss. As for Spillane, who played his most recent snaps as the calendar turned to December, he leads the way with 97 tackles while also having a hand in one sack, one forced fumble and two interceptions. The inside linebacker joined the partial participants during Friday’s practice.

Westover was sidelined for the Patriots on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day due to an ankle injury that arose in the fourth quarter last weekend. The fullback moves forward as questionable, along with a member of the cornerback depth chart, after practicing in a limited capacity on Friday.

But additional calls loom without game designations. When asked whether offensive tackle Will Campbell or defensive tackle Milton Williams will be activated in time for the finale, New England’s head coach provided optimism.

“We’ll see how they respond to today’s work. Try to get them a full week of work in,” Vrabel said of the full participants. “But I think it looks good. Both were able to work the whole week, and we’ll see where they’re at tomorrow.”

Some teams are opting to use Week 18 as a tune-up before the playoffs begin, while others are making bold moves to keep their starters in. Here is a rundown of notable roster situations to watch in Week 18.

Expected to play starters

Los Angeles Rams

After a “humbling” 27-24 loss to the Atlanta Falcons on “Monday Night Football,” Rams head coach Sean McVay did not hesitate to declare his starters active for Week 18 against the Arizona Cardinals.

“We need to play,” McVay said. “We need to play better football.”

The Rams have lost their last two games and eliminated themselves from the NFC West and No. 1 seed race. Instead, Los Angeles is between the No. 5 or 6 seed. Quarterback Matthew Stafford might also want to use this week to redeem his MVP case after one of his most inconsistent showings against the Falcons. It’s worth noting a win by the Seattle Seahawks over the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday night would lock the Rams into the No. 5 seed — and a wild-card matchup with the NFC South champions — and perhaps change McVay’s approach.

Statuses to watch

Buffalo Bills

Coach Sean McDermott said quarterback Josh Allen will practice on Friday and “be good to go” against the New York Jets on Sunday. The quarterback missed some practice time earlier this week with a foot injury, bringing up speculation about how the team would handle his status — and the status of the other starters — against a lowly 3-13 Jets team. Buffalo is already locked into a wild-card spot in the AFC and could land anywhere between the No. 5 and 7 seeds.

There are two caveats here, though. First, Allen has a 139-game starting streak, across the regular season and playoffs, that is the longest active streak for a quarterback. Last season, he played one snap in Week 18 to preserve it.

Second, this is likely the final game at the Bills’ old Highmark Stadium.

Resting QB/key starters

Los Angeles Chargers

Quarterback Justin Herbert will not dress for his team’s Week 18 matchup with the Denver Broncos, coach Jim Harbaugh said earlier this week. Herbert fractured his left hand four weeks ago. He had surgery to stabilize the fracture and didn’t miss a start, but Harbaugh said “he’s got bruises that need to heal” before the Chargers’ playoff run.

Los Angeles could rest other starters against the Broncos, but Harbaugh did not specify who those players might be. The Chargers already clinched a playoff berth and are currently the No. 6 seed in the AFC. They could drop to No. 7 with a loss to the Broncos or move up to No. 5 with a win, plus some help elsewhere. Trey Lance will start at quarterback for the Chargers.

The game means much more for the AFC West champion Broncos, who would lock up the No. 1 seed and the first-round bye with a victory. Denver could fall as low as the No. 3 seed if it lost and the Jacksonville Jaguars and New England Patriots both won.

Philadelphia Eagles

Coach Nick Siranni said the “marathon of a season” is the reason he will be resting key starters against the Washington Commanders despite playoff seeding still on the line. Tanner McKee will start at quarterback in place of Jalen Hurts, and others will likely join Hurts on the sideline. This is the fourth time in five seasons in which the Eagles have rested key players in Week 18.

The Eagles, currently the NFC No. 3 seed, could rise to No. 2 if they beat the Commanders and the Chicago Bears lose to the Detroit Lions. If they remain the No. 3 seed, they would host either the Rams or the 49ers.

Green Bay Packers

Quarterback Jordan Love has cleared concussion protocol but will not start against the Minnesota Vikings. Love has not played since suffering his first documented NFL concussion in the second quarter of a Week 16 overtime loss to the Bears.

Third-string quarterback Clayton Tune will get Sunday’s start. The Packers’ backup options are limited in a banged-up quarterback room. Malik Willis is nursing a hamstring injury, and the team signed Desmond Ridder to the practice squad on Wednesday. The Packers are already locked into the NFC’s No. 7 seed and will travel to play either the Eagles or Bears in the wild-card round.

Indianapolis Colts

Philip Rivers’ three-game resurgence from retirement is officially done. Already eliminated from playoff contention, the Colts will start rookie Riley Leonard in their season finale against the Houston Texans.

The 44-year-old Rivers confirmed in an interview on the “Up & Adams Show” on Wednesday that his playing career is over (again) and he will return to coaching high school football next year in Fairhope, Ala., where two of his sons will be on the same team. Leonard was a sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame and has appeared in four games this year, mostly in garbage time during blowouts.

Las Vegas Raiders

The Raiders don’t have playoff implications at stake, but they will lock up the No. 1 pick if they lose to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. Coach Pete Carroll told reporters on Wednesday that he was getting quarterbacks Kenny Pickett and Aidan O’Connell ready to go, while starter Geno Smith is likely not to play with an ankle injury. Carroll said Pickett, who has been the primary backup this season while O’Connell spent time on the IR, will likely start, but he expects both quarterbacks to play.

Star pass rusher Maxx Crosby will also not play after the Raiders placed him on injured reserve last week due to a lingering knee injury. The decision caused tension between the team and Crosby, who told reporters three days before his IR designation, “I don’t give a s— about the (first) pick, to be honest.” Tight end Brock Bowers was also placed on IR last week with a knee injury that’s bothered him all season.

If the Raiders beat the Chiefs, who are down to their third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun, they could still end up with the No. 1 pick if the New York Giants lose to the Dallas Cowboys. They also could still end up with the top pick even if the Cowboys win so long as at least three of these teams win this weekend: Seahawks (at 49ers), Cleveland Browns (at Cincinnati Bengals), Falcons (vs. New Orleans Saints) or Bears (vs. Lions). Among those teams, the Seahawks, Falcons and Bears are all favored, according to BetMGM.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/02132440/GettyImages-2253987452-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-02 16:59:41.184176

Star edge rusher T.J. Watt, who returned to practice in a limited capacity this week, indicated Friday when speaking with reporters that he will play in Sunday's decisive clash against the Baltimore Ravens.
""I feel pretty good,"" Watt said.
""Honestly, I don't know if I could say that a week ago but I feel really good.
I feel really confident about the week of practice and excited to play.""","It appears as if the Pittsburgh Steelers will have one of their top players back on the field as they push for an AFC North title in Week 18. Star edge rusher T.J. Watt, who returned to practice in a limited capacity this week, indicated Friday when speaking with reporters that he will play in Sunday's decisive clash against the Baltimore Ravens.

Watt has been sidelined since Dec. 7 after undergoing surgery to correct a partially collapsed lung.

""I feel pretty good,"" Watt said. ""Honestly, I don't know if I could say that a week ago but I feel really good. I feel really confident about the week of practice and excited to play.""

Watt initially went to a Pittsburgh hospital last month when he experienced discomfort in his chest after a dry needle treatment session. The ensuing surgery caused him to miss three games.

Watt indicated that he plans on taking a break from dry needling for the time being.

""It was very scary,"" Watt said. ""Just a significant amount of pain. Obviously, anytime you go to work and then have to all of a sudden need surgery, it sucks. Just a lot of unknown. But I'm glad to have the doctors that we had, surgery that I had. To be able to be here and play in a football game this weekend is all I'm really focused on now.""

Prior to the setback, Watt, a four-time first-team All-Pro with the Steelers, had 53 total tackles, including 15.5 for a loss, and seven sacks. He also logged an interception and seven pass deflections.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/02/a0419c0c-b910-4fcd-81f8-9462e3cc4d21/thumbnail/1200x675/f2d8aa401b669ad2ab6bce98943065b4/gettyimages-2249563802-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 18:00:10.587453

​With possible returns from injured reserve on the horizon, DT Milton Williams (ankle) and LT Will Campbell (knee) are off the injury report.
This week, starting LT Will Campbell returned to practice for the first time since injuring his knee in a Week 12 win over the Bengals.
Depending on whether Campbell is activated for Sunday's game, the Patriots have two possible starting offensive line combinations.
Campbell and Williams playing in Sunday's regular-season finale will give them in-game reps before the intensity increases in the playoffs.","On Friday, New England ruled out OLB Harold Landry III (knee), LB Robert Spillane (ankle), LG Jared Wilson (concussion), and NT Khyiris Tonga for Week 18. The Patriots also listed FB Jack Westover (ankle) and CB Charles Woods (foot) as questionable for Sunday's game vs. the Dolphins. ​With possible returns from injured reserve on the horizon, DT Milton Williams (ankle) and LT Will Campbell (knee) are off the injury report.

Starting with a trio of Patriots currently on injured reserve, reinforcements should be arriving for New England just in time for the playoffs. This week, starting LT Will Campbell returned to practice for the first time since injuring his knee in a Week 12 win over the Bengals. Campbell was injured when he was hit on the side of his knee while pulling in space in front of a run play. As for Williams, the standout defensive tackle returned to practice last week, but wasn't active in Week 17. Lastly, CB Alex Austin (wrist) is also eligible to return from injured reserve.

​Campbell, the fourth-overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, started the first 12 games of his NFL career at left tackle. He was having a strong rookie campaign, ranking second among rookie tackles in pressure rate allowed (5.4%). At the time of the injury, the hope was that the 21-year-old would be able to return for the postseason and after being a full participant in practice this week, it appears that Campbell is on track to return for at least the postseason. ​

Although he'll be welcomed back with open arms, backup LT Vederian Lowe filled in well for Campbell over the last four games. In four starts filling in for Campbell, Lowe only allowed one sack, showing he is capable of spot-starting in place of the talented rookie. New England also has some uncertainty at left guard with third-round rookie Jared Wilson remaining in concussion protocol. Last week, super-sub Ben Brown made his third start at left guard for Wilson, but had some ups and downs, allowing three total pressures.

Depending on whether Campbell is activated for Sunday's game, the Patriots have two possible starting offensive line combinations. The first option would be LT Campbell, LG Brown, C Bradbury, RG Onwenu, and RT Moses. The other would be another week of Lowe in for Campbell at left tackle, with New England having until 4 p.m. ET on Saturday to decide on Austin, Campbell, and Williams.​

As for Williams, the standout defensive tackle has participated in the last four practices in a limited capacity, as he works his way back from a high-ankle sprain suffered in Week 11. Williams told reporters this week that he has more ""confidence"" in his ankle to possibly give it a go on Sunday, while adding that he'd like to knock some of the rust off before the playoffs. On Friday, head coach Mike Vrabel had a positive update on Campbell and Williams.

""We'll see how they respond from today's work. Tried to get them a full week of work in, but I think it looks good. Both of them were able to work the whole week and we'll see where we're at tomorrow,"" Vrabel said.

Campbell and Williams playing in Sunday's regular-season finale will give them in-game reps before the intensity increases in the playoffs. However, three key defenders remain out for the Patriots: Landry, Spillane, and Tonga. With the Pats missing four key pieces in their front seven, including Williams, their run defense has slumped to 19th in rush EPA allowed, while New England now ranks 20th in pass-rush win rate. The run defense, in particular, is missing its starting MIKE linebacker (Spillane), best block-shedder (Williams), and run-stuffing nose tackle (Tonga).

Although he won't play this week, Spillane returned to practice on Friday for the first time in three weeks, a positive step toward a potential return in the playoffs. Spillane was last active in the Patriots loss to the Bills but didn't play and hasn't played or been at practice since Week 15. Spillane also appeared on WEEI radio and gave a positive update on his status for the playoffs.

""I'm very motivated. Every day I come here eager to get back on the field, preparing. I think we're moving in the right direction. I'm looking forward to getting back on the field,"" Spillane said.

As for the Dolphins, star RB De'Von Achane (shoulder) is doubtful and starting S Minkah Fitzpatrick (calf) won't play on Sunday for Miami. Achane leads the league in yards per carry (5.7) and explosive runs (40), anchoring the eighth-ranked rushing attack in EPA. The Dolphins are mathematically eliminated from postseason contention, so with nothing to play for on Sunday, Achane could sit – a significant loss. Rookie RB Ollie Gordon II and Jaylen Wright will likely get the bulk of the carries for Miami if Achane doesn't play.

Although the Patriots are headed to the playoffs as AFC East champs, the AFC playoff seeding is still undecided heading into Week 18. With a win, New England secures a top-two seed, while it could finish with the No. 1 overall seed in the conference with a win and a Broncos loss. If the Patriots lose, they could fall to the No. 3 seed if the Jaguars beat the Titans in Jacksonville. With a chance at the No. 1 overall seed and the No. 2 seed to preserve, Vrabel said all healthy players will play vs. the Dolphins on Sunday. As mentioned, the Patriots have until 4 p.m. ET on Saturday to activate Austin, Campbell, and Williams from injured reserve – we'll keep you updated. ​",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/dsgb7xsutjsrwtmcn1wk,N,,2026-01-02 16:59:45.511494

Rookie left tackle Will Campbell, the No. 4 pick in April’s draft, seems poised to return to game action after missing four games with a right knee injury.

“It looks good,” coach Mike Vrabel said regarding the odds Campbell will be protecting quarterback Drake Maye’s blindside in Sunday’s regular-season finale against the Miami Dolphins. Campbell will have to be activated from injured reserve to play in Sunday’s game.

The addition is a massive one for the Patriots with the postseason looming. While Vederian Lowe played fine in relief of Campbell, the Patriots needed Campbell back before the start of the playoffs. Now, Campbell will have one game against the Dolphins to prep for playoff action.

“I’m looking forward to having Big Willy back out there and looking forward to seeing him get back to doing what he does best,” Maye said earlier this week.

Allen aggravated his foot injury during the Bills' Week 17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles and didn't practice on Wednesday and Thursday, casting doubt over whether he'd play in Buffalo's regular-season finale.

However, Allen has started 121 straight games -- 134 in a row, if you include playoffs. There's also the added factor of saying goodbye to ""The Ralph,"" otherwise known as Highmark Stadium, as Sunday will mark the Bills' final home game there, barring some postseason upsets. Buffalo (11-5) is currently seeded seventh in the AFC playoff bracket and can jump up to No. 6 or No. 5 depending on how Week 18 goes.

Allen was injured and missed four games during his 2018 rookie campaign and has started every game since Week 12, 2018.

The Panthers would clinch their first division crown since 2015 with a win, while the Buccaneers need a victory on Saturday plus an Atlanta loss to New Orleans on Sunday to be the South champs for a fifth season in a row. To find out how to watch, listen and livestream the game, click here.

As Pro Football Talk writes, it's ""now or never for the Bucs to snap out of it."" One analyst considers the return of Tristan Wirfs to be a very important factor in the outcome, and CBS Sports' Pete Prisco thinks the Buccaneers' offense will get back on track. One expert considers the Panthers a somewhat easier team to trust at the moment, and another notes Carolina's alternating pattern of wins and losses over the last 10 weeks would suggest a win on Saturday. While one analyst pointed out that the Bucs' averaged just 5.6 yards per pass attempt against the Panthers in Week 16, another provides the counterargument that Carolina's Bryce Young only threw four passes more than seven yards downfield last week, completing just one.

The Buccaneers are 2.5-point favorites at home but the experts are finding it difficult to trust either team and thus there isn't much of a consensus. Here's what some of them are predicting will occur on Saturday afternoon at Raymond James Stadium:

NFL.com – Four of five analysts go with the Bucs, but none predict a margin of more than four points

ESPN.com – Eight of the 11 assembled experts have their picks in, and six go with the home team

CBSSports.com – Pete Prisco sides with the Bucs in a six-point decision

USA Today – Only one of six prognosticators likes the Buccaneers in this one

Bleacher Report – Using the spread, four of seven analysts go with Carolina

""Over the last couple months, the Panthers' previously potent run game has ground to a halt, while their once-stout run defense has become a sieve. The Bucs have their own issues, to be sure, but they also have the more experienced quarterback and coach in this matchup, as well as the more established roster. This isn't truly a postseason play-in game -- while Carolina would clinch the division with a win, Tampa needs a win on Saturday and an Atlanta loss to New Orleans on Sunday -- but it will feel like one in the moment. And with this game taking place in Raymond James Stadium, I'm all too willing to go down with the pirate ship.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/buccaneers/pjcbqcaspqsnrqpywrvr,N,,2026-01-02 16:59:48.693308

No wonder he was happy.

After practicing fully each of the last two days, the Seahawks’ Pro Bowl kick and punt returner plus wide receiver is full go to play Saturday when Seattle (13-3) goes for the NFC West title and the conference’s top playoff seed at the San Francisco 49ers (12-4) in Santa Clara, California.

Shaheed was not on the official injury report the Seahawks issued Thursday for the game. That indicates a team plus an independent doctor both cleared him through all five phases of the NFL’s concussion protocol. Shaheed got concussed last Sunday when Carolina cornerback Mike Jackson threw him into and well beyond the sideline boundary into the Panthers’ bench area following Shaheed 8-yard catch and run. Seattle won the game 27-10.

He was the reason the Seahawks rallied from 16 points down in the fourth quarter to beat the Los Angeles Rams 38-37 in overtime Dec. 18. Shaheed touchdown on a punt return began Seattle’s comeback.

The Seahawks’ other positive injury development Thursday was veteran swing tackle Josh Jones practiced and is questionable to play Saturday. Jones injured his ankle and knee in the Carolina game, his second consecutive start for injured Charles Cross.

Coaches have praised Jones for his play replacing Cross as the blind-side protector for right-handed quarterback Sam Darnold.

“That’s why we signed him (in March),” offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said Thursday

Cross is officially out for the 49ers game. He injured his hamstring on Jason Myers’ game-winning field goal on the final play of Seattle’s win over Indianapolis Dec. 14.

The Seahawks signed undrafted rookie offensive tackle Amari Kight from the practice squad to the active roster this week as insurance in case Jones can’t play at San Francisco. But Thursday’s developments signal Jones likely will play.

The Seahawks have a light practice at team headquarters Friday before they fly to the Bay Area Friday afternoon.

Starting safety Coby Bryant is listed as doubtful for the game Saturday. He missed the Carolina game last weekend with a knee injury he got during the Seahawks’ win over the Los Angeles Rams Dec. 18. Ty Okada is poised to start again for Bryant. Okada has started 10 games this season, nine for previously injured Julian Love.

The Vikings and Packers have met 130 times in their history, with Green Bay possessing a 67-60-3 advantage in the series.
Sunday will be just the fourth time in franchise history the Vikings have won at least four consecutive games going into the final week of the regular season.
The previous three instances happened in 1969 (12 consecutive victories), 1998 (seven consecutive) and last season (nine consecutive).","Although Minnesota and Green Bay have faced each other twice a year during the regular season since the Vikings inception in 1961 (except for the strike-shortened 1982 season), the two teams have rarely closed the regular season together. Sunday's game will mark only the seventh time in the Border Battle's history the Vikings and Packers will play each other in the regular-season finale. Naturally, both teams have split the previous six such meetings, which are detailed below:

The Packers won't be taking any chances with so many banged-up offensive players, including Jordan Love, Josh Jacobs, Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs and some linemen. They also will try their best to rest some defenders ahead of the Wild Card round. The Vikings can now smell finishing above .500 to salvage a rough season of QB transition for Kevin O'Connell. Regardless of the QB they throw in, the Vikings will finish well to make Justin Jefferson and others feel much better for 2026.

Packers Head Coach Matt LaFleur announced Thursday that, despite Jordan Love clearing concussion protocol, Clayton Tune will get the start Sunday. He was thrust into action last week, and it didn't exactly go well, but this will be his second career start – his first was in 2023 with the Cardinals. Injuries have caused the Packers to spiral, losing three straight, so getting healthy is likely the main priority before heading on the road for the first round of the playoffs. Minnesota is trending in the opposite direction at the moment, winning its past four games thanks to the dominant play of Brian Flores' defense, which allowed 12.3 points per game in that span. Might we see more of the same with Tune under center for Green Bay? Probably. Offensively, it's still been a struggle for the Vikings. J.J. McCarthy has a chance to start despite dealing with a hairline fracture in his hand. Honestly, at this point, I don't care who the Vikings trot out at quarterback. What I do care about is Justin Jefferson getting 53 yards, which he needs to hit 1,000 receiving yards for the season. He would join Hall of Famer Randy Moss and Mike Evans as the only players with 1,000-plus receiving yards in each of their first six seasons. It'll be a shame if a healthy Jefferson doesn't accomplish that feat because of this season's nightmarish QB play.

I certainly don't feel comfortable favoring the Vikings by this many points in a divisional game – regardless of who is at quarterback. However, I think this game will mean a whole lot more to Minnesota than it does to the Packers, who are locked into the NFC's No. 7 seed. I'd expect Green Bay to sit multiple starters on both sides of the ball and to fall behind late as the Vikings try to end their season on a high note.

The Vikings and Packers have met 130 times in their history, with Green Bay possessing a 67-60-3 advantage in the series. Last year, Minnesota swept the Packers in the regular season for the first time since 2017; on Sunday, the Vikings will try to avoid being swept by Green Bay for the first time since 2019. The Packers claimed the most recent matchup at Lambeau Field in Week 12 with a 23-6 victory to snap Minnesota's two-game win streak against Green Bay.

After dropping four consecutive games in November, the Vikings have made a late-season charge, as Minnesota has won its past four contests. Sunday will be just the fourth time in franchise history the Vikings have won at least four consecutive games going into the final week of the regular season. The previous three instances happened in 1969 (12 consecutive victories), 1998 (seven consecutive) and last season (nine consecutive). The 1998 season is the only one in which Minnesota won the regular-season finale.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/hbxsjlph4lydrxs3rkd4,N,,2026-01-02 15:00:45.539564

Love has been cleared from concussion protocol but is being rested for the playoffs.

Coach Matt LaFleur is prioritizing injury avoidance as the team is locked into the NFC's seventh seed.

GREEN BAY – Jordan Love lay on the grass at Soldier Field, eyes closed until the Green Bay Packers staff arrived, ringing in his head.

He’d just taken a hit from Chicago Bears defensive end Austin Booker, and his head was throbbing. Love would get up and run to the locker room with the urgency of a player who wanted to return as quickly as possible.

“I didn’t know,” Love said. “I’m always trying to go out and hopefully meet with the doctors, see what’s going on and try to get back as quickly as possible. But I didn’t know at the time.”

The plan for Love finally became clear Jan. 1. Love’s sack, which was nullified because Booker led with his helmet against the quarterback’s head, with 8 minutes, 21 seconds left in the second quarter at Chicago on Dec. 20 will be his final regular-season snap this season.

The Packers will start quarterback Clayton Tune this week against the Minnesota Vikings, declining to use their Week 18 matchup as a tune-up for the postseason. With his team locked into the NFC’s seventh seed regardless of the result, coach Matt LaFleur is prioritizing rest and injury avoidance over finding a late-season rhythm.

Love would be available if the Packers still had a chance to win the NFC North this week. He's a full participant in practice and was cleared from concussion protocol on Jan. 1. Instead, LaFleur made clear “the intent is not to play him.” The Packers were eliminated from a division title in last week’s loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Love said he prepared the entire week like he would play against the Ravens. He felt no symptoms of his first NFL concussion but learned late in the week he failed the computerized testing necessary to clear the league’s concussion protocol.

“I understood what the situation was,” Love said. “I just didn’t clear the concussion protocol. It’s one of those things where you understand coming into it you might be going, you might not be going. It just came down to understanding that obviously the protocol is there in place to try to keep me safe, protect me. And even though you might be feeling good, there’s a lot more things that could happen potentially in a game to knock you out even further.

“So it’s just understanding that and understanding I’ll be good. It’ll be good to sit out a week, rest and come back under center.”

The potential problem, of course, is that Love will not be returning one week after missing the Ravens game. He will instead enter next week’s NFC wild-card playoff matchup at either Chicago or Philadelphia without having played in almost three full games. The Packers are structuring practice this week in an attempt to mitigate any rust from such a substantial absence.

LaFleur’s plan includes scripting practice periods to include starters on offense and defense taking reps against each other. Love said the only difference from a game is he won’t be hit in practice. He isn’t concerned about practice reps failing to adequately prepare for game speed in the postseason.

“I would even argue,” Love said, “sometimes in the game it feels like it slows down a little bit compared to practice. It’s something where I played all season. It’s not like I sat out all season and am just coming back. I have a lot of banked reps playing out there. I know what it’s like to be on the field and feel those things, and obviously vice versa in practice trying to emulate game speed and get everything back to feeling like you’re in that atmosphere.”

Love didn’t just start 15 games this season, staying healthy until his concussion. He started twice against the Bears and once against the Eagles, the Packers’ two potential opponents in the wild card. He’ll have familiarity with both defenses that stand in the Packers’ way of the divisional round.

He’s also using this week to get a head start on preparation. The Packers are likely to play the Bears, given the Eagles also are resting starters in their regular-season finale and currently hold the third seed. Love said he has “a good idea” of who his team will play next week, and he’s already started watching film.

Love is still in quarterbacks meetings this week and will help Tune prepare for his start, but it’s not the same attention on the Vikings that would be required if he were starting.

“Obviously, if I was starting this game, I would be preparing and having all my focus on this week,” Love said, “and this is a defense that you’ve got to have a lot of focus going into that week and just understanding the different looks. So, yeah, if you can get ahead and start looking at other teams, it definitely helps out.”","https://www.packersnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/21/PMJS/87868933007-packers-20-27.jpg?crop=4147,2333,x0,y114&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-02 16:59:56.696906

LaFleur said he “anticipates” Packers rookie defensive end Collin Oliver finally making his NFL debut in Week 18.

Oliver was drafted in the fifth round out of Oklahoma State, where he mostly lined up as an edge rusher and off-ball linebacker, totaling 134 tackles, 40.5 tackles for loss, and 23.5 sacks. Unfortunately, his senior season was limited to just two games due to a foot injury.

""He dealt with a little bit of an injury this year, didn't play a lot, but the one thing about him, especially back to the '23 tape, you turn the tape on him, and you can see he's got a twitch and explosiveness off the edge that brings a little bit more of a unique skillset that way,"" said Packers director of scouting Milt Hendrickson after the team took Oliver 159th overall. ""He's also got some versatility that's going to allow him to play some stack (linebacker), and then he brings incredible special teams value with his whole skillset.""

Oliver was expected to be a situational pass rusher and contributor on special teams, but a hamstring injury cost him all of training camp and the preseason.

The Packers placed Oliver on the physically unable to perform list to start the regular season and didn’t designate him for return until Dec. 2. After making it through multiple weeks of practice, Oliver was then activated to the 53-man roster on December 22.

The hope is that Oliver can add some juice to a Green Bay pass-rushing unit that will be without Micah Parsons for the rest of the season and hasn’t gotten a sack from Rashan Gary in nine straight games.

However, even if Oliver makes his rookie debut Sunday against the Vikings, the game will have no impact on the Packers' playoff positioning. Coming off three consecutive losses, they are already locked in as the NFC’s seventh seed. Green Bay is expected to rest several of its key players against Minnesota, including quarterback Jordan Love, who sustained a concussion against the Chicago Bears on Dec. 20 and only recently cleared the league's protocol. With backup Malik Willis dealing with a shoulder injury, LaFleur confirmed Thursday that third-string quarterback Clayton Tune will be the starter.

Still, Sunday's game could be an opportunity to get a good look at Oliver and newly acquired corner Trevon Diggs as the team tries to get back on track to make a deep run in the postseason.","https://packerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/23/SPAC/85340155007-usatsi-26073571.jpg?crop=5021,2825,x0,y264&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-02 13:59:35.978423

Stacy Rost: Defense wins championships? Seahawks are counting on it

Wide receiver and Pro Bowl return man Rashid Shaheed is set to play Saturday night, as he does not have an injury designation on Thursday’s report just four days after suffering a concussion in a win over the Carolina Panthers.

That’s big news for the 13-3 Seahawks, as it means they will continue to have a dynamic presence on special teams thanks to Shaheed, who has returned both a kickoff and a punt for a touchdown since coming to the Seahawks in a November trade with the New Orleans Saints.

Three Seahawks have injury designations for Saturday’s game:

• Starting left tackle Charles Cross will be out for the third straight week with a hamstring injury.

• Starting safety Coby Bryant is doubtful, putting him at risk of missing a second straight game with a knee injury.

• Tackle Josh Jones, who has started on the offensive line in Cross’ absence, is questionable with ankle/knee concerns.

Bryant and Jones were both limited in practice Thursday after not participating Wednesday, while Cross did not practice at all this week.

Shaheed was a full participant on both Wednesday and Thursday.

As for the 49ers, they have three notable offensive players questionable for Saturday: left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring), tight end George Kittle (ankle), and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle). Cornerback Upton Stout (concussion) and defensive lineman Keion White (groin) have also been ruled questionable.

Kittle and Pearsall have been limited in practice this week, while Williams has not participated. Star Niners running back Christian McCaffrey did not participate in practice Tuesday, was limited Wednesday and practiced in full Thursday while dealing with a back issue.

The Seahawks and 49ers (12-4) will meet at 5 p.m. Saturday, with the winner taking the NFC West championship, the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and a bye through the wild card round of the playoffs. Radio coverage on Seattle Sports will begin at 2 p.m. Saturday with the pregame show.

We'll see how quickly he can find his way onto the field in Green Bay.","Trevon Diggs' surprise departure from Dallas landed him with an NFC contender in Green Bay.

It's a fresh start he may have needed to get back on track after an injury riddled last few years, and it returns Diggs to a place of importance -- even if he might not yet own a vital role with his new squad. Because of injuries at the position, Diggs could find himself on the field soon; Packers coach Matt LaFleur did not rule out Diggs potentially playing as soon as Sunday's regular-season finale against the Minnesota Vikings.

""It feels good, you know?"" Diggs said of the move Thursday, via ESPN. ""I want to be comfortable with being uncomfortable being somewhere that I've never been before. Just starting over, starting fresh, a clean slate, and just working, and keeping my head down, and just working.""

Diggs arrives in Green Bay with a résumé that once stood up against the elites of the NFL but hasn't carried the same weight over the last three seasons. A two-time Pro Bowler and 2021 first-team All-Pro selection, Diggs has played in just 21 games over the last three campaigns, missed eight games in 2025 due to a concussion he admitted he suffered in an at-home accident and saw his tenure with the Cowboys -- a team that once valued him enough to hand him a lavish five-year, $97 million extension in 2023 -- end with Dallas unceremoniously waiving him just before the new year.

Despite the difficulties, Diggs' confidence remains unchanged, telling reporters Thursday he still feels ""like I'm the best."" Now, he has to prove that to his new team and an NFL audience that might be rightfully skeptical of his potential.

""I think I just need to be myself, you know? Be who I know I am,"" Diggs said. ""Go out there and perform and performing everything will take care of itself. I'm not chasing accolades. I'm not chasing anything. I'm chasing, you know, being a better me, being better every day ... helping this team win.""

Diggs stormed onto the scene in his second NFL season, logging a league-best 11 interceptions in 2021, but has since snagged just six picks over the following four seasons. He joins a Packers team that likely isn't worried about production potential and is instead more interested in adding a skilled corner to a roster that needs one after losing two (Nate Hobbs and Kamal Hadden) to injury in Saturday's loss to Baltimore.

""He can help us tremendously,"" safety Xavier McKinney said. ""He can get the ball, and I think that's one thing that we're missing, obviously, is getting the ball at a high rate. And I think he can be the guy that comes in and really helps us with that. In that way, I think it's going to be a big help for us.""

If Diggs is going to make an immediate impact in either Week 18 or Wild Card Weekend, he'll have to acclimate quickly. Luckily, he has a former Cowboys teammate, edge rusher Micah Parsons, in Green Bay to help him adjust.

""He told me, you know, it's work,"" Diggs said of Parsons, who is on injured reserve after suffering an ACL injury in Week 15. ""It's a lot different. He said I'm going to like it a lot and I'm going to enjoy it. So far, I've been enjoying it a lot. My first day was out there today, and I had a lot of fun. And it's a great, great thing to be here.""

Running back Chase Brown (illness) was out for the second straight practice. The illness Brown is dealing with hasn’t been specified, and he could still play on Sunday. If he can’t go, look for Samaje Perine and rookie Tahj Brooks to man the backfield.

Defensive end Joseph Ossai (ankle) also missed another practice, and with him missing Week 17, it is looking like his 2025 season may be over, opening the door for more snaps for rookie Shemar Stewart. Defensive tackle B.J. Hill (ankle) was out again as well after missing Wednesday.

Josh Newton (hamstring) was upgraded to a limited participant after missing Wednesday, so he may have a chance to be back in the lineup.

For Cleveland, standout rookie linebacker Carson Schwesinger (quad, ankle) was out yet again, so they could be without one of their top defenders.

Both of Cleveland’s top tight ends have missed both practices as well. David Njoku (personal) and Harold Fannin Jr. (groin) could be out of the lineup Sunday. Njoku, however, is a veteran who could play without practicing.

Guard Teven Jenkins (concussion) was upgraded to a limited participant on Thursday, but he remains in the NFL’s concussion protocol and would still need to be cleared in order to play Sunday.

Nick Underhill of New Orleans.Football first reported the news.

Luckily, the blood clot was caught early. Underhill added that Olave is being discharged on Thursday and is doing well.

Olave's season will end with 100 receptions, 1,163 receiving yards and nine receiving touchdowns, all career highs. He's the first Saints player with 100-plus receptions post-Drew Brees retirement (last was Michael Thomas' NFL record 149 in 2019).

Olave enters 2026 set to play on the fifth-year option, worth $15.493 million. He is in line for a massive contract this offseason.

Burden had no more than four catches in any game until his last two outings.
We did a great job of protecting and really flipping into that protection that we needed to handle.","The emergence of the Bears' top two picks in the 2025 draft over the past two months has helped fuel an offense that ranks in the top 10 in scoring (10th) and total yards (3rd) after finishing in the bottom five in both categories last year.

""They've progressed really since they've gotten here,"" said offensive coordinator Declan Doyle. ""Early on, they had been banged up a little bit and so they didn't have quite full offseasons. But they've just done a great job of keeping their heads down.

""I think it's a byproduct of them being very willing and growth oriented. It's an environment that encourages that, and then the position coaches have done a great job with both of those guys staying on them and continuing to push them to grow.""

Loveland, a first-round selection, missed all offseason practices while recovering from shoulder surgery, while Burden, a second-round choice, sat out most offseason workouts and the first few days of training camp with a hamstring injury. Neither rookie, however, allowed that to stop them from blossoming into a key contributor on a division championship team.

""It's not something that happens a lot, and yet it's not something outside of the realm,"" Doyle said. ""When you watch their habits and how they work every single day and you see them go out and have success on Sunday, it ties together, it makes sense.""

After averaging 1.8 catches and 19.3 yards with no touchdowns in six games played in September and October, Loveland averaged 4.1 receptions and 56.2 yards with five TDs in nine contests in November and December.

""[I've been] getting a couple more targets and a couple more opportunities to make plays and I've been doing so for the most part, which has been good,"" Loveland said. ""It's been a blessing. I've always trusted the process, trusted coaches and trusted my teammates.""

Burden had no more than four catches in any game until his last two outings. He had six receptions for 84 yards in a win over the Browns, and after missing the overtime victory over the Packers with an ankle injury, established career highs last Sunday night in San Francisco with eight catches and 138 yards, including a 35-yard TD from Caleb Williams.

""I'm super blessed,"" Burden said. ""Me and Colston came here, and we set our goals and winning the division was one of them … I feel like coach [Ben Johnson] is getting us more involved and Caleb is doing a great job spreading the ball around. We're just taking our opportunities and making the most of them.""

""You see a guy who is more in command as far as when he's up there and utilizing the cadence to an advantage,"" Doyle said. ""We talked about that a lot when we first got here, just our cadence being something that we wanted to kind of hang our hat on. It helps you in a lot of different ways, being under center and your guys being able to come off the ball and get a little bit of an edge just because the quarterback's cadence is consistent.

""That's a situation that we practice quite frequently. They jumped; we pulled the trigger at center. We did a great job of protecting and really flipping into that protection that we needed to handle. [Williams] did a good job of working out there, and then Loveland able to separate and we create a big play down the field. We create a touchdown and it's really all of [Williams'] cadence.""

""That speaks to the quarterback, that speaks to [center] Drew [Dalman] being able to direct things,"" Doyle said. ""You've been in 17 battles together and there's shared experience as far as how we handle problems, how we handle things that might come up that are unscouted, and the communication is much cleaner.

""And then just confidence. Confidence is born of demonstrated ability, and so they've seen themselves perform at the highest level at times.

The Rams have signed Lake to a three-year contract extension, the team announced Thursday.
The new deal comes the day Lake returned to practice after a six-week trip to injured reserve to repair a dislocated elbow.
In the six games since that injury, Los Angeles has surrendered 25.6 points per game.
“You don’t replace a Quentin Lake,” coach Sean McVay said at the time of the injury.","WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. — Los Angeles Rams safety Quentin Lake made his return to practice this week, and he came back to quite a reward.

The Rams have signed Lake to a three-year contract extension, the team announced Thursday. The three-year deal is worth $42 million with $25.7 million of it guaranteed, a league source confirmed to The Athletic.

The new deal comes the day Lake returned to practice after a six-week trip to injured reserve to repair a dislocated elbow. The return was all about getting the top leader on defense back into the fold, and now the Rams are making that status clear with a rare in-season extension.

This is the second in-season extension on defense this year, along with linebacker Nate Landman’s three-year deal. The Rams typically wait until the offseason to negotiate with their players, but it was always a goal to sign a deal with Lake, who spent much of his childhood in Los Angeles before playing at UCLA and then getting drafted by the Rams.

“This is a place I’d love to play for, for the rest of my career,” Lake said earlier this season.

Lake’s impact is hard to ignore, whether he’s on the field or not. The 2022 sixth-round pick grew from a special-teamer and backup his first two seasons to a full-time starter last year, when he racked up 111 tackles. This season showed a growth in playmaking from him, as he intercepted his first pass, forced a fumble, recovered a fumble and added a sack through 10 games before the injury.

Lake’s play defines the scheme that coordinator Chris Shula runs, which deploys four- and five-man fronts with heavy zone coverage and dime defenses built to hold serve against the run with lighter bodies and confuse the quarterback with pre- and post-snap coverage movement. Lake mastered that role in his fourth season by rotating from nickel cornerback to strong safety to free safety while also communicating those changing coverages to younger players as a team captain.

With Lake starting this season, the Rams boasted one of the best defenses across the board, despite fielding the lowest-paid offensive or defensive unit on any NFL team. Through 10 games, the Rams allowed just 17.2 points per game.

In the six games since that injury, Los Angeles has surrendered 25.6 points per game. The defense had a strong showing the next week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but the Rams lost 31-28 to the Carolina Panthers when they couldn’t turn Bryce Young over, and the run defense showed leakage for the first time. They then allowed 34 points to the Detroit Lions, 38 to the Seattle Seahawks and 27 to the Atlanta Falcons. They went 3-3 in that stretch, after an 8-2 start with Lake.

Lake had always been targeting a return for the postseason. The Rams opened his 21-day practice window for Thursday’s practice and expect him to make his in-game return for the wild-card round next week, when Los Angeles will play on the road.

“You don’t replace a Quentin Lake,” coach Sean McVay said at the time of the injury. “He’s so valuable for so many reasons with what he can do, with who he is as a human, with the way that he elevates and leads. He’s a glue guy for us.”

Now, the franchise has shown it means that.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/01152925/GettyImages-2241084426-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-02 05:58:37.784637

Simpson said he had an X-ray at halftime, and he was on the field to start the second half for the Crimson Tide.

Simpson said the injury occurred after he took a helmet to the rib while scrambling for a first down late in the first half. He fumbled on the play, however, and Indiana recovered.

""Felt like I had a good thing going on that drive when I got hit,"" said Simpson, who completed 12 of 16 passes for only 67 yards in the game. ""It kind of changed the momentum for sure. ... The competitor in me wanted to make sure I got the first down. Got more than the first down, and then should have been smart and just got down.""

Simpson said he had an X-ray at halftime, and he was on the field to start the second half for the Crimson Tide. After a three-and-out, he said he realized that he couldn't play through the injury and ""I made an executive decision and thought [about] what gave us the best chance to win.""

Backup Austin Mack played the rest of the game for Alabama.

Said Simpson: ""I thought Austin being 100 percent could help us win.""

Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said Simpson wanted to see if he could continue to play in the second half.

""We treated him there at halftime and he gave it a series, and I know he feels like he let down the team -- and there's no way that that's the case,"" DeBoer said. ""He went out there and tried to battle, and that's who he is. And so I'm never going to let that be a thing where he [thinks he] let us down in any way.""

Mack, a redshirt sophomore who has completed 13 of 16 passes this season for 125 yards, guided the Crimson Tide to a field goal on his first drive for Alabama's first -- and only -- points of the game.

Mack, a third-year sophomore, went 11-of-16 for 103 yards against the Hoosiers with three sacks.

If Williams is unable to play, the 49ers will turn to Austen Pleasants to make his first career NFL start. He entered the NFL as an undrafted rookie in 2020 and spent time with five teams before joining the 49ers late last season. He saw considerable action in the final two games of 2024 while splitting time with Charlie Heck after the 49ers lost their top three left tackles due to injuries. Pleasants earned a spot on the 49ers’ 53-man roster after a strong training camp.

“A big thing for him is every Wednesday, since he's been our swing tackle, is Trent takes Wednesdays off,” general manager John Lynch said on 49ers Game Plan. “We give him (Williams) Wednesdays off to get his body back. And he (Pleasants) has taken advantage of those opportunities, and I think that gives him some comfort. He's worked with the starters before.”

Pleasants was called upon Sunday night against the Chicago Bears when Williams sustained a hamstring injury while chasing linebacker T.J. Edwards’ 34-yard interception return for a touchdown. Pleasants entered the game at the beginning of the next possession and played the final 71 snaps in the 49ers’ 42-38 victory.

White has played approximately 60 percent of the 49ers’ defensive snaps as part of the 49ers’ defensive line rotation since arriving in a mid-season trade from New England.

Cornerback Renardo Green is also set to be back after missing two games with a neck condition.

Epps, 29, is now in the NFL’s concussion protocol and will have to clear that protocol before he’s able to return.

The Eagles have already elected to rest key starters for their Week 18 game against the Commanders but it’s unclear if the plan was to play Epps. The veteran has played well next to Reed Blankenship in the second half of this season and has helped solidify the back end of the defense.

Here’s the full injury report from Thursday:

Full: LB Jihaad Campbell (back/shoulder), S Marcus Epps (concussion)

NFL

Epps this season has played in 12 games and has started 4. He has played very well since taking over the starting job. Epps’ experience has been on display the last month.

For most of the season, the Eagles started rookie Drew Mukuba at the safety spot next to Blankenship in the secondary but Mukuba fractured his ankle in Dallas on Nov. 23 and has been on Injured Reserve after having surgery. The Eagles started Sydney Brown for one game before activating Epps off IR from a shoulder injury and starting him.

The Eagles initially signed Epps to their practice squad after training camp but eventually signed him to the 53-man roster. Before his IR stint coming off the bye week, Epps had played just 15 defensive snaps all season. Since his return, he has played 235 and is fully expected to be the starter when the playoffs begin next weekend.

Epps is in his seventh NFL season and his second stint with the Eagles. He was a full-time starter for the Super Bowl season in 2022.",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/12/Epps-M-Getty-2241956265.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-01 19:58:07.504504

NFL

LB Jihaad Campbell (back/shoulder) was practicing after being listed as limited to start the week. This should be his second straight start.

And OT Cameron Williams (shoulder) was practicing after being listed as a full participant to start the week. The Eagles activated Williams off IR to the 53-man roster, which means the sixth-round pick will make his NFL debut on Sunday. Williams on Thursday was removed from the injury report after being activated.

The Eagles are going to rest many key starters for their Week 18 game against the Commanders, so it’s not a big deal that Johnson, Dean, Goedert and Phillips are not practicing this week. They will obviously not play against the Commanders as the Eagles rest up for their wild-card round game the following week.

Johnson will miss his seventh consultive game after suffering a Lisfranc sprain against the Lions on Nov. 16 and Dean will miss his second after suffering a hamstring injury against the Commanders on Dec. 20.

Phillips suffered that ankle injury in the win over Buffalo and could probably use a bye week anyway; he has already played in 17 games this season because of the timing of his trade from the Dolphins to the Eagles. Goedert has missed just one game all year but will likely sit in this regular season finale.

Some Eagles starters are going to be inactive on Sunday, while others will be limited and some will dress out but will not play.

Olave is eligible for a contract extension this offseason and set to make more than $15 million next season after the Saints picked up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract.

McCarthy missed last week’s game with a right-hand injury. He practiced in full Thursday for the first time since exiting the Week 16 game against the New York Giants with the injury.

“I felt like the ball was spinning,” McCarthy said after Wednesday’s practice. “We’ll take it day to day.”

Earlier in the season, head coach Kevin O’Connell suggested that McCarthy needed a full week of practice to give him the best chance at optimal performance. The circumstances are different this late in the season. O’Connell said Monday the team would love to get McCarthy one final opportunity.

It’s been a rollercoaster of a season for the 2024 first-round pick. McCarthy, 22, has missed seven games due to three injuries: a high-ankle sprain, a concussion and currently a hairline fracture in his throwing hand. He struggled early in the season, then found his footing from Weeks 14-16. Improved accuracy and decisiveness provided optimism about McCarthy’s trajectory. He called having to miss the Week 17 victory versus the Lions “extremely tough.”

“I’ve had a lot of ups and downs and twists and turns,” McCarthy said. “But at the end of the day, it’s a beautiful picture and a beautiful story that I’m really starting to understand the meaning of. And the reasoning behind it. And we’re not done yet.”

Green Bay has secured its playoff bid, so it may not play most of its starters. Regardless, this is an opportunity for McCarthy to give a closing statement on his first season as a starter ahead of a critical offseason. The current Vikings regime has not won a playoff game. Flipping that will likely be the expectation in 2026, which will require a particular baseline level of play at the quarterback position.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/01165836/GettyImages-2252294261-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-01 19:58:29.176813

Mayfield suffered a left shoulder injury against the Rams earlier in the season but returned the next week.
As to whether the right shoulder injury could affect Mayfield on Saturday, though, shouldn't change his availability, said Brown.","CHARLOTTE — Claudin Cherelus was out of the boot he was wearing all week on Thursday, but he's not ready to play, which is forcing the Panthers to adjust at linebacker again this week.

With Cherelus ruled out, the Panthers are thin at the position, with veteran Krys Barnes and rookie Bam Martin-Scott up next to play next to Christian Rozeboom.

Barnes has played in 74 games with 32 starts in his career, but he didn't practice Tuesday because of a back issue. He's listed as questionable on the final injury report.

Martin-Scott has played defense in a couple of games this year (San Francisco and Seattle).

""We've been working him back in, looking better and better each day; so hopefully we'll get him out there,"" Panthers head coach Dave Canales said of Barnes. ""Krys has played some good snaps for us, and then we got a couple of other guys.""

Canales said if need be, known commodity Jacoby Windmon could be activated from the practice squad for depth.

But obviously, Barnes' experience is significant in a situation like this with the playoffs on the line.

""Extremely valuable,"" Canales said. ""Just with the week of preparation, and what do you do? You don't do anything different. You go about it the same way, and you attack the work, and Krys has been a stud for us. We've asked him to play special teams roles, pop in there and play linebacker for us, he's a guy that can handle a lot and has really good experience within our scheme. So, really fortunate that he's here.""

Hunt and Moore's status remains questionable

Offensive lineman Robert Hunt and receiver David Moore both continued to practice this week, within their 21-day window to be activated. Both are officially considered questionable for the game, but Canales isn't quite ready to commit to either playing on Saturday against the Buccaneers. However, it is for different reasons.

""David had a fantastic week, you know, at this point it's just about figuring out, roster-wise, when that makes sense for us,"" Canales explained. The roster is currently full at 53 men, so for Moore to be activated, a man would have to be cut.

As for Hunt, it remains a matter of having him physically ready.

""Rob was able to do a little bit more, but we got to see how his body responds tomorrow (Friday), and that's why, you know, it's questionable right now for Rob.

""We were able to kind of ramp up his work, but it's like the recovery of what does this thing feel like the next day, where are we at in terms of football, whole football readiness.""

Some of the challenges with testing Hunt's readiness stem from the fact that teams are not in pads at this late stage of the season. And for an offensive lineman, a lot of their work centers around being as physical as possible, something that isn't full tested unless in pads.

""We were able to simulate some things from a physical standpoint,"" Canales shared, before continuing, ""Not being in pads certainly does present its challenges. If we were just practicing in the normal scheme of the season and being able to hit each other and all that, you can gather a little bit more information.""

However, considering Hunt's injury is in his biceps, the coaches can still gather a lot of information from non-padded drills.

""The nature of the injury, he just needs that physical change of direction and getting his hands split the right way. So we were able to evaluate some of that.""

No question about Baker Mayfield's toughness

Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield popped up on Tampa Bay's injury report this week with right shoulder and knee. He was a limited participant on Tuesday, but was able to practice fully on Wednesday.

Those who know him well, such as Canales (who was Mayfield's coordinator in Tampa in 2023) and Derrick Brown (who was teammates with Mayfield in Carolina), fully expect to see him on the field Saturday.

""My short time with Baker, this is a tough guy. This is a competitor. He's a great teammate. He's going to be out there with this team, and he's going to give everything he has,"" Canales said Thursday. ""We got to expect that. We got to be ready for that version of Baker, and, so, and I respect him for it, and I've seen him battle through things and find his way to game day and give everything he has.""

Mayfield suffered a left shoulder injury against the Rams earlier in the season but returned the next week. The left shoulder is Mayfield's non-throwing shoulder, but he has thrown five of his 10 interceptions in the five games since. As to whether the right shoulder injury could affect Mayfield on Saturday, though, shouldn't change his availability, said Brown.

""Knowing 6, he'll be out there Saturday,"" said Brown. ""He'll be out there for sure. So, you know, I think he's the ultimate competitor, so we'll see him out there Saturday.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/panthers/ljrj14tfqvdmlwt4czub,N,,2026-01-01 18:58:47.232081

Ravens quarterback Tyler “Snoop” Huntley started in Jackson’s absence and went 16-of-20 passing for 107 yards and one touchdown. Huntley was aided by running back Derrick Henry, who rushed for 216 yards and four touchdowns, both of which were career highs with the Ravens.

Jackson practiced Wednesday and Thursday and will wear extra padding to protect his back. Before the back injury, Jackson dealt with hamstring, toe and knee injuries this season. He missed three games earlier in the season with a hamstring injury.

Jackson’s injuries this season have limited his mobility. His 63 rushing attempts, 340 rushing yards, and 2 rushing touchdowns are all career-low numbers for Jackson.

Despite the season being on the line, the Ravens’ concerns extend beyond this season. The Baltimore Sun reported on the team's frustration with Jackson’s practice and preparation habits. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh and Jackson denied the report.

Harbaugh has also been under fire for the 1-4 start to the season and the lack of playoff success in recent history.

No practice

RT Penei Sewell (ankle)

IOL Trystan Colon (wrist)

DT Alim McNeill (abdomen)

Sewell has now missed back-to-back practices, and it’s fair to speculate if he’ll play this week, considering coach Dan Campbell’s comments earlier in the week surrounding playing injured players. At the same time, Sewel has taken two practices off earlier in the season and was still able to play by Sunday, so there is still a chance he plays on Sunday.

Colon missing two practices with a lingering wrist injury he has previously played through is unusual, and could be a sign he re-aggravated it.

McNeill showed up on last week’s injury report, then exited Week 17 very early and has not practiced since. His status for this Sunday’s game is very much up in the air.

Limited practice

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee/ankle) — upgraded from no practice

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness)

LG Christian Mahogany (illness) — upgraded from no practice

OL Kayode Awosika (illness) — upgraded from no practice

OT Giovanni Manu (knee) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 6

LB Alex Anzalone (concussion) — upgraded from no practice

SAF Thomas Harper (concussion) — upgraded from no practice

St. Brown hopes to be able to play this weekend, per Campbell, and a return to practice on Thursday sets him up for that. He’ll need to participate on Friday in some capacity, but signs are pointing up. St. Brown talked to our Jeremy Reisman in the locker room on Thursday.

“I feel solid. I would say a little banged up, but good enough to go, so that’s all that really matters.”

St. Brown would go on to add that he doesn’t believe there is any long-term injury risk involved for him with his current ailment:

“I don’t think so. Obviously, there’s risk in any game you play with any injury, but to answer your question, I don’t think so.”

Decker getting in a second practice this week is a good sign that he’ll be able to finish out the season on the football field.

Mahogany and Awosika returned from their illnesses, a good sign that they’re likely to be available on Sunday.

Manu is closing out his injury evaluation window, but it’s still not entirely clear if he’ll be activated and play this weekend. Sewell’s health could be a factor in determining that.

Anzalone and Harper both returned to practice on Thursday, suggesting they’re progressing through the NFL injury protocols. That being said, there are still hurdles to clear, and there’s no guarantee either play, especially Harper, who is dealing with his second concussion this season.

Joining the limited, both starters were back at practice as Miami Dolphins prep continued inside the WIN Waste Innovations Field House. But fullback Jack Westover, guard Jared Wilson, defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga, as well as linebackers Harold Landry III and Robert Spillane remained non-participants.

Here’s the second injury report leading up to Sunday’s 4:25 p.m. ET season finale at Gillette Stadium.

After beginning the week with seven sidelined, the Patriots went forward with five sidelined. Wilson, Tonga, Landry and Spillane had all been ruled out ahead of what became a 42-10 win over the New York Jets last Sunday. But the visit to MetLife Stadium also ended without Westover due to an ankle injury that surfaced on a kickoff in the fourth quarter.

The Patriots had four partial participants on hand. After catching his seventh touchdown and eclipsing 700 receiving yards for the first time in his NFL career, Henry missed practice on New Year’s Eve due to a knee injury. And across the line of scrimmage, Barmore, who is facing a domestic assault charge stemming from August, had also been absent due to an illness. Elsewhere, two players whose 21-day practice windows opened over the past week remained limited. Ankle and wrist injuries sent Williams and Austin to injured reserve in November. Both await activation.

Boutte went without a non-contact jersey after spending the past week in the NFL’s concussion protocol. The wide receiver has caught 31 passes for 527 yards and six touchdowns through 13 appearances this campaign. He was among six full participants for the Patriots as 2026 arrived.

The Bills quarterback did not practice on Wednesday or Thursday.

With the Bills seemingly destined to finish as the No. 6 seed in the AFC, and given that they’re playing the Jets, it could make sense to give Allen all or most of the day off on Sunday.

The injury happened in Week 16 against the Browns, on a long self-sack play. He finished the game, but his post-game contention that the foot didn’t affect him in the second half wasn’t convincing.

After seemingly aggravating it against the Eagles, Allen insisted it had “zero” impact on him. (And then he went to the X-ray room.) Meanwhile, Allen possibly rushed his throw on the fateful two-point misfire to receiver Khalil Shakir so that he wouldn’t have to try to run away on the injured foot from Eagles linebacker Jaelan Phillips.

Given that Sunday will likely be the last game at Highmark Stadium, maybe the Bills will give Allen a drive or two. Or maybe just one snap so he officially gets the start in the final game.

Neither player has been activated to the 53-man roster yet, but both are eligible.

Even if Reid and Sanders are not eventually activated, they will still count against the team's limit of eight designations, so the club has to weigh roster spots and return limits as it makes decisions.

Olave, 25, will finish his fourth season with the Saints with a career-best 1,163 receiving yards and nine touchdowns. The 2022 first-round pick will head into his fifth-year option if he and the Saints do not reach a contract extension before the 2026 season begins.

Olave, who has been dealing with a recurring back injury this season, was able to play in a win against the Tennessee Titans in Week 17 after receiving treatment on Friday and Saturday.

He said last week that his goal was to play all 17 games after missing the second half of the 2024 season after sustaining two documented concussions.

Olave said he contemplated retirement at one point last season after seeking opinions from concussion specialists.

""It was a tough time last year,"" Olave said after the Saints' win against the New York Jets on Dec. 21. ""I was only 24 years old, contemplating retirement, especially with the head injuries, but I prayed about it. My fam, my close fam was around me.

Coach Matt LaFleur said Thursday that Love would only play on Sunday if he's needed as the backup quarterback, but most likely either Malik Willis or Desmond Ridder would serve as the No. 2 quarterback against the Vikings.

He was a full participant in practice Wednesday for the first time since the Bears game and was cleared Thursday, 12 days after what was believed to be the first concussion of his NFL career.

Willis was a limited participant in practice Wednesday because of right shoulder and hamstring injuries. He did not throw at all during the open viewing portion of practice but said he threw a few passes later in the session. The Packers signed Ridder to the practice squad Wednesday, giving them four quarterbacks in house for the first time since training camp. LaFleur said Ridder could ""potentially"" serve as the No. 2 quarterback Sunday.

The Packers (9-6-1) are locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC and will open the playoffs with a wild-card game on the road against either the Bears or Philadelphia Eagles. The Vikings (8-8) have been eliminated from playoff contention and have not named a starting quarterback yet for Sunday.

Tune, a fifth-round pick of the Arizona Cardinals in 2023, has made one NFL start -- a 27-0 loss to the Cleveland Browns midway through his rookie season. He completed 11-of-20 passes for 58 yards with two interceptions and a lost fumble.

He joined the Packers on Aug. 28, when he was signed to the practice squad. He was elevated for game day last week against the Ravens and finished the game after Willis reinjured his shoulder. He completed just 1-of-4 passes for 8 yards with an interception on a pass that went off the hands of receiver Bo Melton. Tune was signed to the active roster Wednesday.

""He's a guy that's shown some pretty good promise in terms of what we've seen,"" LaFleur said. ""What an opportunity for him. I think he's started one other game in his career, I want to say. It's going to be a great opportunity, it's going to be great for everybody to see what he can go out there and do.""

LaFleur said he plans to rest some starters before the playoffs but other than Love did not say which players.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1223%2Fr1593193_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 14:58:17.446657

""The boys were really coming out today with a level of intent, focus, energy, urgency, and it was really awesome to kind of feel that momentum we've been building over the last few weeks carry into today,"" McCarthy said. ""We've gotta keep doing that. A great divisional rival ahead of us, and it's going to be a lot of fun.""

""It's win-at-all-costs when it gets late in the year,"" McCarthy said. ""Everyone's banged up, and it's that willpower, falling into your … habits and your discipline in those habits. I feel like we did a lot of the things early on that helped us become successful in December, and it's encouraging to see it happen … but we've got to get in the dance, and we've got to make sure we don't end up in this position again — and take care of the [games] we've got to take care of.""

""But you know, the most encouraging thing is seeing them pick me up and understanding the culture, the type of guys we have in that room — it's something special,"" he said. ""So yeah, it's been a tough year, but we learned a lot about each other, a lot about ourselves and me personally.""

"" 'Understand, you know, this is one of the hardest positions in the world, and you're 22 years old,' "" he said when asked what advice he would give for himself at training camp.

The Packers have already secured the No. 7 seed for the playoffs, and LaFleur said he doesn’t plan to play Love unless injuries make it necessary. Love will likely enter the wild-card round having missed the last 10.5 quarters since suffering his first documented NFL concussion midway through the second quarter of a Week 16 game against the Chicago Bears.

The Packers are uncertain who will back up Tune. Malik Willis is nursing a hamstring injury, and the Packers signed Desmond Ridder to the practice squad Wednesday. It’s possible that Love backs up Tune, but the Packers would probably like to avoid the scenario of their starter coming off a head injury being one snap away from playing.

Tune is a 2023 fifth-round pick of the Arizona Cardinals who spent the entire season on Green Bay’s practice squad before stepping in when Willis aggravated his right shoulder injury last Saturday against the Baltimore Ravens. Tune completed 1-of-4 passes for eight yards and an interception on a tipped pass that wide receiver Bo Melton dropped.

Sunday will mark Tune’s second career start, with his first coming in a 27-0 loss to the Cleveland Browns in 2023. Tune completed 11-of-20 passes for 58 yards and two interceptions in that game while running five times for 28 yards and losing a fumble.

“I think there’s a lot to like,” LaFleur said of Tune. “I think he’s got a good handle on the offense, especially for a guy that really wasn’t here through an offseason or training camp. … You can tell he’s a smart guy. He’s got some athleticism in regards to his ability to get out of the pocket.

“I think that that was one of the alluring things about him, is just he is not a statue back there by any stretch. He can make off-schedule plays, and we’re just trying to put him in the best position possible to go and make plays.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/01124839/love-jordan-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-01 14:58:23.451600

Allen (foot), linebacker Terrel Bernard (calf), defensive end Joey Bosa (hamstring), safety Jordan Poyer (hamstring), defensive tackle DaQuan Jones (calf) and fullback Reggie Gilliam (illness) did not practice.

""He looks like he's moving in the right direction,"" McDermott said of Allen. ""We'll see how it goes this week.""

Allen tweaked his foot during Week 16's game against the Browns. He played on it against the Eagles and McDermott said he is in a better place this week than last.

The HC did not give us an update about starters resting or playing, but McDermott sees value in both sides when it comes to his QB.

""There certainly is,"" McDermott said of if there's value in Allen playing on Sunday. ""There's also value in taking another approach as well so that's what we're going through right now. It all starts with number one is his health. And I could tell you that he's in a better spot according to Nate (Breske) early this week than he was last week.""

Tight ends Dalton Kincaid (knee) and Dawson Knox (knee), cornerback Cam Lewis (hamstring) and defensive tackle Jordan Phillips (ankle) were limited.

""He's in a better spot than the way he ended the week,"" McDermott said of Kincaid. ""We'll take it one day at a time and see where it goes.""

Kincaid missed last week's game against the Eagles due to the knee injury.

Kicker Matt Prater (right quad) was full on Wednesday.

""Anytime you miss a game, it's always tough,"" Prater said. ""Watching the games play out and you're not a part of it, it's tough to watch. But I'm excited to get back out there.""

Prater has missed the last two games with the right quad injury. McDermott said on Monday that Prater is heading in the right direction.

Bills players reflect on their memories at Highmark Stadium

With Buffalo being a Wild Card team in the playoffs, Sunday could be its last time playing in Highmark Stadium. The Bills have called the stadium home for 52 memorable years. They'll move across the street to the new Highmark Stadium for 2026.

The players reflected on what the stadium means to them and how, though they're focused on the task at hand and winning the game, they're going to take a moment to appreciate and soak up everything around them from the locker room to the field to the fans.

""I love football history. There's so much football history that has happened at Highmark, and this stadium means a lot to a lot of people,"" offensive lineman David Edwards said. ""To be a part of that's really special, and I don't take that for granted. Even though I've only been here three years, I really feel like I'm part of this community, part of this history and that means a lot to me and my family.""

""The history of it all – to be a part of that definitely feels surreal,"" wide receiver Gabe Davis said. ""This is a game that we all dreamed about playing, and to be able to beat some of the record books and doing it in that stadium.""

For defensive end Greg Rousseau, he said one of his all-time favorite memories is from 2024 when kicker Tyler Bass kicked the game-winning field goal against Miami with 10 seconds left of the game. The 61-yard kick was a career-best for Bass, gave Buffalo a 30-27 victory and secured the AFC East title that season.

""Just being in the moment, walking through the locker room another time and walking out the tunnel, running out,"" Rousseau said of what he wants to do. ""We've had a lot of crazy wins in there … I can go on for hours about it, but it was real special. Had a lot of fun there.""

Knox said he plans on dedicating a moment on Sunday to take a few deep breaths and take everything in. Whether it's before the game, after the game or even a moment during the game, he wants a mental and emotional snapshot of Highmark Stadium one last time.

""The sentimental value of that stadium, the nostalgia that I'll be feeling, the amount of memories that I'll carry with me for the rest of my life. I'm so thankful for that,"" Knox said. ""Even though it's just a location … it's a place that I'll be forever grateful for.""

Long snapper Reid Ferguson is the current longest active Bills player (10 seasons), so he has memories of Highmark Stadium from before the Sean McDermott and Josh Allen era.

""Every game is a blessing and every game is a gift,"" Ferguson said. ""It's a privilege to be able to go out there and wear the Bills uniform – and wear just an NFL uniform in general.""

James Cook can finish the regular season at the top of the league

Running back James Cook has an opportunity to claim the NFL's rushing title in 2025. He currently leads the league in rushing yards with 1,606 yards and Indianapolis Colts' rusher Jonathan Taylor is second with 1,559 yards.

""That's definitely on my mind,"" McDermott said when asked if Cook will play on Sunday. ""That's a heck of an accomplishment if one can accomplish that, or in this case a team or an offense can accomplish that. So, I'm aware of it, we'll see where it goes here.""

Cook being on track to lead the NFL in rushing yards in the regular season is an accomplishment that reflects on the whole offense. McDermott said it takes everyone, not just the offensive line and sole running back, to be at the top. He said it's an honor for the entire offense regardless of the player's position.

""He's earned it. He deserves it. You see the types of plays he makes every game. It's really fun blocking for a guy like that,"" Knox said. ""We'll be proud of that as well – the o-line, especially. It's not only [Cook], but the work that they put in, what they do every Sunday that helps him get that title.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/bills/nnwhi1gxnj90l8wxemtq,N,,2026-01-01 17:58:20.811199

Earlier this season, McCarthy missed five games because of a high right ankle sprain and a sixth because of a concussion.","EAGAN, Minn. -- Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy practiced Wednesday for the first time since he was diagnosed with a hairline fracture in his right hand earlier this month.

The team listed him as a limited participant on its practice report and has made no final determination about his availability for Sunday's season finale against the Green Bay Packers.

McCarthy has missed seven games this season because of three separate injuries, most recently the Vikings' 23-10 victory over the Detroit Lions on Christmas Day. But coach Kevin O'Connell said he is eager to get him back on the field for one final outing before the end of the season, hoping to continue the momentum built during a four-game winning streak.

""A ton of stuff during this win streak has been about stacking plays,"" O'Connell said, ""stacking for our team, just positives of complementary football and finding a way to win by any means necessary every single game. And that's credit to players. That's what they've done. And J.J.'s been a huge part of that, really looking at starts seven, eight, nine, and would love to get him another one. But obviously, only if he's medically cleared and can 100 percent do his job.""

O'Connell said the decision on McCarthy's availability will be based on whether he can reliably grip the ball. The Vikings removed him from their Week 16 game at the New York Giants after the ball fell out of his throwing hand on an aborted screen pass, leading to a fumble that safety Tyler Nubin returned for a 27-yard touchdown.

On Wednesday, McCarthy said he ""felt like the ball was spinning"" and added: ""If it's stable, let's ride."" But asked when the pain from the injury subsided enough to resume throwing, McCarthy said that ""was a difficult question to answer.""

McCarthy also wasn't able to pinpoint when the injury occurred.

""It was just a multitude of things,"" he said. ""Things that happened over the year.""

McCarthy had previously suffered what the Vikings called a bruised hand in Week 10. The injury caused him to be a limited participant in one practice but did not force him from any games. A review of the game film showed that McCarthy hit his hand on the helmet of Giants defensive lineman Roy Robertson-Harris after a throw with two minutes, 57 seconds remaining in the second quarter at MetLife Stadium. McCarthy managed to throw a short completion on the next play and then scrambled 12 yards for a touchdown. He opened the Vikings' next possession by handing off to tailback Aaron Jones, but on second down he dropped the ball as he tried to throw the screen pass.

McCarthy said Wednesday that ""there was a lot of adrenaline"" before the touchdown run but that he felt the hand ""right away when I went to the sideline.""

""That was a great learning lesson for me to handle that situation a lot better in the future,"" he said. ""If I don't feel like I can go or there's any sort of gray, just take it into halftime and regroup from there.""

Jeremiah: What’s changed since Seahawks’ Week 1 loss to 49ers

Here’s a look at each team’s injury report for Wednesday. Both teams will have to make their game status designations by Thursday.

Seahawks injury report

Left tackle Charles Cross (hamstring) and veteran swing tackle Josh Jones (ankle, knee) were both listed as non-participants on Wednesday’s practice report for the second straight day, which further indicates there’s a real possibility the Seahawks could be down to their third-string left tackle on Saturday night.

Cross, who has missed the past two games, has yet to practice since getting injured in the final minute of Seattle’s Week 15 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Dec. 14. Jones, who has started at left tackle in place of Cross for the past two games, was a new addition to the injury report this week.

If neither Cross or Jones are available, Seattle’s other options at left tackle include undrafted rookie Amari Kight and rookie guard/tackle Mason Richman. They have a combined three offensive snaps this season.

Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald didn’t divulge much about the team’s left tackle situation when speaking to reporters prior to Wednesday afternoon’s practice.

“If Josh can play, he’s gonna play,” Macdonald said. “If Charles gets better and can play, he’ll play. If not, then we’ve got some other guys that can play.”

Meanwhile, wide receiver/kick returner Rashid Shaheed (concussion) was upgraded to a full participant on Wednesday after being listed as limited on Tuesday. That appears to indicate he’s progressing through the NFL’s concussion protocol after sustaining a concussion in Sunday’s win over the Carolina Panthers.

However, safety Coby Bryant (knee) was downgraded to a non-participant on Wednesday after being limited on Tuesday. He’s working his way back after missing Sunday’s game.

Here’s Seattle’s full injury report for Wednesday:

According to the Steelers, Watt “was experiencing some discomfort” at the team’s facility on Dec 10 and was later taken to a Pittsburgh-area hospital for an evaluation of his lung.

Watt underwent surgery on Dec 11 and was discharged on Dec 12. He has not played an NFL game since Dec 7 but may play in the January 4 season finale against the Baltimore Ravens, which will decide the NFL’s AFC North Division title.

ESPN reports that dry needling is “a skilled intervention where the provider uses a thin needle to penetrate the skin with the goal of alleviating pain and improving movement. Unlike ‘wet’ needling, which utilizes a hollow bore needle (which has a central channel to allow liquid to pass through it) to inject a medication, dry needling utilizes a solid needle and no substance is injected. Common applications for dry needling include, but aren’t limited to, muscle pain/strains (eg, hamstring, quad), tendinitis/tendinopathy (eg, patellofemoral, biceps, rotator cuff), plantar fasciitis and headaches. Utilization has expanded within the past decade, in particular, and it is not uncommon to see dry needling in most athletic rehabilitation settings or training rooms.“

Richardson sustained his injury in Week 6 when an elastic band in the Colts' locker room snapped and hit him in the face.

Instead, 2023's fourth overall pick continues to battle vision problems due to the orbital fracture he sustained earlier in the year, and the Colts will not activate him from injured reserve for the regular-season finale.

Instead, coach Shane Steichen announced Wednesday that Riley Leonard will start in what is now a meaningless Week 18 game for the Colts, who have been eliminated from playoff contention. Seth Henigan, who signed with the Colts' practice squad, has a chance of serving as the backup. If he is not up to speed, Philip Rivers will handle the backup duties.

""Had a conversation in my office yesterday with him,"" Steichen said of Richardson. ""It was great. He's still got the vision limitations. It's just a smart thing. Obviously, you put him out there with vision limitations and something happens, not a good idea. So we won't activate him.""

Richardson sustained his injury in Week 6 when an elastic band in the Colts' locker room snapped and hit him in the face. The backup quarterback experienced severe swelling around the broken orbital bone, though he avoided damage to his eyeball. More than two months later, he still does not have all of his vision back.

With the Colts tumbling all the way out of the postseason picture despite opening the year at 8-2, they have no incentive to rush Richardson back at less than 100% -- even as they lack experienced options behind injured starter Daniel Jones, who tore his Achilles tendon earlier this month.

""It was a freak accident that happened,"" Steichen said. ""I feel for him, because it is a terrible thing that happened. You never want it to happen. You don't know why things happen. But he's been in good spirits, and he's battling like crazy and hopefully everything comes back good.""

The 2025 season goes down as a lost year for a once-promising prospect who just two years ago was a first-round talent. Richardson remains under contract with Indianapolis through 2027, but if Jones returns to full strength in time for next year's opener, there is no clear path to the starting lineup for the Florida product.

It could take a trade for Richardson to get another shot at a starting job in the next two years. His outlook with the Colts is as cloudy as ever. But returning to full health is a bigger priority at this point than determining his long-term role, according to Steichen.

""I think the biggest thing for him is just to make sure that vision comes back fully, and then we go from there,"" Steichen said. ""He's a talented player. Very talented. Can make all the throws and run around and make plays. So really just praying for his health right now.""",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/01/34913bb2-ef09-4379-a291-b67b40f34bda/thumbnail/1200x675/6790d442db98fa233c6d0e5565dcf68c/gettyimages-2235427299-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-01 04:58:50.627302

Richardson entered the 2025 campaign as the Colts’ backup after losing the starting job to Daniel Jones in training camp.","Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr. will not be available for the team’s regular-season finale Sunday against the Houston Texans, remaining on injured reserve due to an orbital fracture, Colts coach Shane Steichen announced Wednesday.

Richardson returned to practice Dec. 18, and Wednesday’s walkthrough marked the first time he was listed as a full participant, but he is still managing “vision limitations” in his right eye that stem from his injury, according to Steichen.

Steichen said he and Richardson had a long conversation in his office Tuesday regarding the decision to keep the dual-threat QB inactive. Richardson appeared in just two games this season, completing one of his two passes (surprisingly to himself) for 9 yards.

“If you don’t have a perfect eyesight there, and something happens (and) you don’t see someone and you get hit, I mean, that’s not a good thing,” Steichen said. “So, we just want to be smart with it.”

Richardson suffered an orbital fracture during what Steichen called a “freak accident” in pregame warmups in Week 6. The quarterback was using a band to stretch. However, when he attached the band to a rod in a locker and pulled it, the rod broke and a piece of the rod recoiled with the band, smashing into Richardson’s face at a high rate of speed, league sources told The Athletic. Richardson was taken to a local hospital and discharged later that day. He was subsequently placed on injured reserve and underwent surgery Oct. 20 to fix his fractured orbital bone.

Richardson initially said he didn’t have any “major limitations” with his vision when he returned to practice a few weeks ago. He reemphasized that point Wednesday while offering more details.

“Everything downfield, not gonna be a problem,” Richardson said. “(It’s) more so within the foot radius of my (vision) box that’s more so the toughest part (in my) daily life, but that’s about it.”

Although he’ll end up missing the final 11 games of the season due to his eye injury, Richardson remains optimistic about his NFL future. The 23-year-old was drafted fourth in 2023, making him the Colts’ highest drafted player since Andrew Luck was first in 2012.

“Oh, yeah, no doubt,” Richardson said of his potential. “If I still got a chance to play football, then, s—, it’s always out there for me.”

Richardson said his eyesight continues to improve, and he’s already seen major progress from when the orbital fracture happened. He’s scheduled to have a check-up in January and anticipates that he’ll have a relatively normal offseason of training as he prepares for his fourth year.

That fourth season might not be in Indianapolis, however. Richardson has not become the franchise QB the Colts envisioned, due to injuries, inaccuracy and immaturity. He was benched for two games last year due to what Steichen labeled as a lack of game preparation. He has only appeared in 15 games in three years, going 8-7 as a starter. He’s thrown 11 touchdowns against 13 interceptions, while adding 10 rushing TDs.

Richardson entered the 2025 campaign as the Colts’ backup after losing the starting job to Daniel Jones in training camp. Despite Jones tearing his right Achilles in Week 14, the Colts are expected to retain him in free agency, potentially giving him another season with Steichen and GM Chris Ballard if they are also retained this offseason. Jones, the 2019 No. 6 pick, was released by the New York Giants last year and inked a one-year deal with Indianapolis. He quickly revived his career under Steichen, which has set him up to be the incumbent starter next year, assuming he doesn’t have any setbacks with his Achilles recovery. In that scenario, if Richardson is still on the Colts’ roster, he’d likely be competing with rookie sixth-round pick Riley Leonard for the team’s QB2 role. Before it gets to that point, he and the team may welcome a trade.

Asked if he’s thought about what’s next for him, Richardson said he “always” thinks about his future but that he hasn’t looked too far ahead.

“I always want my life to be better, better than it was before,” Richardson said. “My life improves each and every year. I haven’t necessarily thought about my future here because I don’t see anything wrong right now. Setbacks happen. The injury to my eye kind of happened, so that kind of dictated what happened throughout the season.”

For now, Richardson looks forward to his last couple of practices, especially since he was initially told that he wouldn’t be able to suit up again in any capacity this season. Richardson has been working with the scout team and has enjoyed the controlled competition.

“Some plays, I catch myself out there throwing and fitting it into certain spots that I was doing before, so that definitely feels good,” Richardson said. “But there were a few plays that the defense did get me, and it hit me like, ‘Man, maybe I should’ve did this or that,’ but it’s just football. I’ve been making plays out there, and I’m excited to be back out there for sure.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/15130422/USATSI_27255004-scaled-e1765821882844.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-01 05:57:35.187357

The team released its first injury report of the week on Wednesday evening. The Eagles held a walkthrough on Wednesday, so this report is an estimation:

Did not participate: LB Nakobe Dean (hamstring), TE Dallas Goedert (knee), T Lane Johnson (foot), OLB Jaelan Phillips (ankle)

Limited: LB Jihaad Campbell (back/shoulder)

Full: T Cameron Williams (shoulder)

The Eagles held a walkthrough to start the week but are scheduled to practice on Thursday and Friday.

While the Eagles can’t rest everyone on Sunday, they probably won’t play anyone with an injury. So this is another hint at who won’t be playing against the Commanders.

NFL

Johnson has missed the last six games with a Lisfranc sprain and it wouldn’t make sense to rush him back for a game where the Eagles are resting a bunch of starters. And Dean missed last week with a hamstring injury; it also wouldn’t make sense to rush him back from that soft tissue injury.

Phillips injured his ankle against the Bills in Buffalo and was able to play through the injury to finish the game. He even had a pressure on that final game-sealing 2-point conversion. Phillips, who was traded during the season, has already played 17 games this season because he was traded before the Dolphins’ bye week and after the Eagles’ bye. So he could really use this week off.

And Goedert’s injury presumably happened during the game as well. He has managed to stay pretty healthy this season, playing 15 of 16 possible games. But if he’s nursing an injury, it would be wise to sit him for this one.

Campbell, 21, is a more interesting case. He had to start for Dean on Sunday and the rookie could probably still use the experience. But if he’s banged up, he might not play on Sunday. The Eagles’ other linebackers are Jeremiah Trotter Jr. and Smael Mondon.",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/12/Phillips-J-USATSI-27622884.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-01 05:57:37.854373

""We'll see how the week progresses,"" McVay said. ""If he is able to go, it'll be great to be able to get him some snaps before the playoffs end up starting, and if he's not, then we'll hope that the playoffs will represent for sure him being ready to go.""

Meanwhile, the Rams will open the 21-day practice window for safety Quentin Lake (elbow) tomorrow, but he and wide receiver Davante Adams (hamstring) are not expected to play Sunday. Lake hasn't played since Week 11, and Adams since Week 14.

McVay declined to rule either out definitively for Sunday, but said the ""goal"" is for both to play in the Wild Card round of the playoffs the following week.

""It's more of just to make sure that we're able to get him a full workload,"" McVay said of Adams' recovery. ""He's gonna be able to do some different things in a more controlled setting, but just with the position he plays, being able to open up, want to make sure that we're getting everything ready to roll and being smart with him.""

Asked what he would expect from players taking on bigger roles in that scenario, Macdonald said.
""Some things need to happen before he can play,"" Macdonald.
I know those guys are working like crazy, but we're going into a football Friday (on Thursday), he'll probably have to do something before the game goes.""","After a walkthrough a day earlier, the Seahawks were back to holding a full practice on Wednesday, which from a preparation standpoint, was like a normal Thursday as the Seahawks get ready for Saturday night's game against the 49ers.

And among those taking part in practice, Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said, was receiver and Pro-Bowl returner Rashid Shaheed. Being on the practice field doesn't guarantee anything for Saturday's game for Shaheed, who exited Sunday's win in Carolina with a concussion, but it is at least a sign that he's moving through the concussion protocol.

""To my knowledge he's practicing today,"" Macdonald said. ""In what capacity, I can't tell you, but he should be out there.""

If Shaheed were unable to play, the Seahawks would be looking for players to step up at receiver as well as in the return game.

Asked what he would expect from players taking on bigger roles in that scenario, Macdonald said. ""Come and play great football for us. I feel like we have a really deep receiving room and guys that have made plays in key moments, from training camp all the way until now. That's what we expect. We've got really good players.""

Macdonald also gave a little more clarity on the injury to tackle Josh Jones, who played every snap in Sunday's game, but who was listed as a non-participant on Tuesday's estimated injury report due to knee and ankle injuries. Jones, who has been starting in place on an injured Charles Cross, is ""just banged up a little bit"" Macdonald said, and should be able to play Saturday.

""Some things need to happen before he can play,"" Macdonald. ""I'd say it's a non-zero chance that he plays, but we'll see.""

Cross, who has missed two games with a hamstring injury, was one of two players to miss last week's game along with safety Coby Bryant, who has a knee injury.

Asked if Bryant was improving, Macdonald said, ""Coby's getting better. He's not going to practice today, he did walkthrough. Again, we'll see. I know those guys are working like crazy, but we're going into a football Friday (on Thursday), he'll probably have to do something before the game goes.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/sq2fchwrnukdxnghhbnl,N,,2025-12-31 21:13:06.336812

Fullback Jack Westover, tight end Hunter Henry, guard Jared Wilson, defensive tackles Christian Barmore and Khyiris Tonga, as well as linebackers Harold Landry III and Robert Spillane stayed sidelined on New Year’s Eve in Foxborough.

But three returned to practice. Wide receiver Kayshon Boutte was back in a non-contact jersey after spending last week in the NFL’s concussion protocol, while the 21-day windows opened for offensive tackle Will Campbell and cornerback Alex Austin to be activated from injured reserve.

Last Sunday’s 42-10 win over the New York Jets did not include Wilson, Tonga, Landry and Spillane. Due to a concussion as well as foot, knee and ankle injuries, respectively, the four starters remained non-participants before being ruled out on the final injury report. The visit to MetLife Stadium saw the team’s fullback depart in the fourth quarter, while at tight end, Henry scored his seventh touchdown of the season and surpassed 700 receiving yards for the first time in his career.

Mike Vrabel shared during Wednesday’s press conference that Barmore, who is facing a domestic assault charge stemming Aug. 8, would miss the team’s in-stadium practice due to an illness. The Patriots head coach added that he hasn’t heard anything from the NFL that would keep the defensive tackle from playing in Week 18. The same status goes for wide receiver Stefon Diggs, who is facing charges of strangulation or suffocation and assault and battery from a Dec. 2 incident. Both legal cases are under review of the league’s personal conduct policy.

Boutte returned to practice as a limited participant after spending Week 17 in the league’s protocol. And across the ball from the wideout, Austin was available in that capacity, as well. A wrist injury had sent the cornerback to injured reserve late last month. He stands with 13 tackles, two starts and one pass deflection on the year and has handled 120 snaps on special teams.

An activation also awaits along the interior defensive line after New England went five contests without Williams due to a high ankle sprain. The four-year, $104 million signing saw his 21-day clock start last week yet remained on IR for the trip to East Rutherford.

Cornerback Trevon Diggs has been claimed off waivers by the Packers a day following his release from the Cowboys, NFL Media reported Wednesday.

A person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press the decision on Diggs wasn't the result of a specific incident.
Diggs eventually returned to the Cowboys' lineup in Week 16, but he's largely struggled this season.","The Green Bay Packers are adding another former standout from the Dallas Cowboys' defense.

Cornerback Trevon Diggs has been claimed off waivers by the Packers a day following his release from the Cowboys, NFL Media reported Wednesday. The Packers will reportedly be on the hook for Diggs' $472,000 base salary and $58,823 bonus he'd get for being active for Week 18.

Green Bay's decision to add Diggs comes four months after it traded for Micah Parsons from Dallas, a move that helped the Packers have one of the league's top defenses this season. However, Parsons tore his ACL earlier in December, and the Packers have seen a handful of other key players go down with injuries in recent weeks ahead of the postseason. In the secondary, the Packers placed cornerback Kamal Hadden on injured reserve on Tuesday, while cornerback Nate Hobbs and safety Zayne Anderson are reportedly likely to miss the rest of the season.

The Packers enter Week 18 with a 9-6-1 record and are locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC for a third straight year. They were ahead in the NFC North race for much of the season, but their Week 16 loss to the Chicago Bears put a dagger in their hopes to win the division.

Still, as quarterback Jordan Love seeks to make a return soon from the concussion that knocked him out of that Week 16 loss, the Packers remain hopeful about making a deep postseason run. They rank second in total defense among the NFC playoff contenders, and the addition of Diggs could help further bolster their defense.

Rumors of the Cowboys potentially moving on from Diggs grew in recent weeks as he spent nearly two months on injured reserve. Diggs missed eight games after sustaining a concussion in an accident at home, something Diggs waited two months to try to explain to reporters. He said he was hit in the head by a mounting pole while trying to install a TV. The team said Diggs' delayed return was more about issues with the 27-year-old's knees.

Asked during the absence what the team needed to see from Diggs to get him back on the field, head coach Brian Schottenheimer said the sixth-year player needed to show consistency in many areas in practice and in meetings. Owner Jerry Jones flatly said near the end of the absence that Diggs wasn't healthy enough to play.

A person with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press the decision on Diggs wasn't the result of a specific incident.

Diggs' departure was a culmination of factors, including performance and off-field issues, and the move was best for Diggs and the Cowboys, the person said on condition of anonymity because the team wasn't commenting specifically on Diggs.

The Cowboys withheld a workout bonus in Diggs' contract after he spent last offseason rehabbing his latest knee injury with his own medical personnel. He was also benched by Schottenheimer early in the season for reasons the coach never fully explained.

Diggs eventually returned to the Cowboys' lineup in Week 16, but he's largely struggled this season. Opposing quarterbacks have posted a perfect passer rating (158.3) when they've targeted receivers Diggs has covered this season, as the cornerback has allowed three touchdowns in eight games, per Pro Football Focus.

Diggs briefly emerged as one of the best cornerbacks in football not long after the Cowboys selected him in the second round of the 2020 NFL Draft. That helped him get a five-year, $97 million extension ahead of the 2023 season. However, the two-time Pro Bowler has only played 21 games since then, tearing his ACL in the 2023 season and undergoing an operation to repair the same knee in 2024.

Defensive lineman Brandon Dorlus has a hamstring injury.
Obviously, going to miss this game, but we do feel really good about what happened, as opposed to what everybody thought.""
Dorlus went down with what was originally thought to be a knee injury.
Only Tennessee's Jeffrey Simmons has more sacks than Dorlus among defensive tackles in the league.","FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. — The Atlanta Falcons got some good news as 2025 comes to a close. Defensive lineman Brandon Dorlus has a hamstring injury. He will miss time, according to head coach Raheem Morris, but nothing close to what was originally feared when he was injured on Monday night against the Los Angeles Rams just a few plays after notching his 8.5 sack of the year.

""We dodged a big-time bullet,"" Morris said. ""We feel pretty good about the injury. He's going to miss a couple of weeks. Obviously, going to miss this game, but we do feel really good about what happened, as opposed to what everybody thought.""

Dorlus went down with what was originally thought to be a knee injury. He was helped off the field by trainers as he struggled to put pressure on his left side. After being evaluated on the sideline, an emotional Dorlus was carted to the locker room.

After more imaging and evaluations, though, it was determined that Dorlus suffered a hamstring injury and that there was no ligament damage in his knee.

Though the Falcons will finish the 2025 season without Dorlus, this isn't an issue that should linger for the second-year defensive lineman tied for the team lead in sacks; not at all like a knee injury that requires surgery would.

One would be hard pressed to find an interior lineman who had as big of a jump from Year 1 to Year 2 as Dorlus did with the Falcons. After only seeing action in two games in 2024, Dorlus became not only someone this Falcons defense could rely on in a rotation but depend on to make a big play. Only Tennessee's Jeffrey Simmons has more sacks than Dorlus among defensive tackles in the league. Along with his 8.5 sacks on the year, Dorlus also notched 11 quarterback hits and tackles for a loss.

In other injury news, the Falcons will continue to be without starting cornerback Mike Hughes, too. Hughes has missed the last two games for Atlanta. Rookie undrafted free agent Cobee Bryant filled in for Hughes when he went out against Tampa Bay and he got the start the next week against Arizona. He split time that game with C.J. Henderson, who started Monday night's game opposite A.J. Terrell.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/falcons/a5bkgstvj3uj7hbvrpwt,N,,2025-12-31 17:59:43.317462

While the Lions don’t plan to rest any of their veterans to get a look at younger players, coach Dan Campbell acknowledged that he will consider shutting down players who have been dealing with season-long injuries or who could risk further injury by playing. In those situations, they will put their next best player on the field to try to win the game. Furthermore, Campbell noted that there’s a difference between players who are injured and players who are just working through the aches and pains of the regular season—the latter of which he expects them to play.

At the end of the day, while logical, this approach complicates our ability to analyze an already messy injury list properly. As always, we’ll do our best to decipher the daily injury reports, but don’t be surprised if there are a few unexpected outcomes this week.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

TE Brock Wright (neck, IR)

OT Giovanni Manu (knee, IR) — Evaluation clock started

LB Zach Cunningham (hamstring, IR)

With neither Wright nor Cunningham returning to practice this week, it looks like their season could be over.

No practice

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee/ankle) — reaggravated in Week 17

RT Penei Sewell (ankle) — reaggravated in Week 17

LG Christian Mahogany (illness) — New ailment

OL Kayode Awosika (illness) — New ailment

IOL Trystan Colon (wrist)

DT Alim McNeill (abdomen) — reaggravated injury in Week 17

LB Alex Anzalone (concussion) — injured in Week 17

SAF Thomas Harper (concussion) — injured in Week 17

St. Brown appeared to be bothered by his existing knee injury in Week 17 and is considered “day-to-day” by coach Dan Campbell. While his availability is still in question for this weekend, Campbell noted that St. Brown “wants to go” and his injury is not long-term, which means there’s a chance he can play against Chicago.

Sewell appeared to aggravate his ankle injury in Week 17, but he managed to play through it. It’s possible that he missed this practice because it was a maintenance day, or it could be a sign that he made it worse. We’ll likely find out more in the coming days.

Mahogany and Awosika have been on the injury report for lower-body injuries in recent weeks, but it looks like they’ve put those injuries behind them. However, they are the latest players to deal with an illness that has been making its way through the locker room.

Colon has been dealing with a wrist injury for a few weeks now, and while it’s limited him at separate times, he’s also shown he’s been able to play through it.

McNeill appeared to aggravate his abdominal injury early in Week 17 and was forced from the game. Like with most players on the report this week, his status is very much up in the air.

Anzalone and Harper were both concussed in Week 17 and are currently in the NFL’s concussion protocol. It’s a wait-and-see approach for both defensive starters.

Limited practice

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness) — upgraded from no practice

OT Giovanni Manu (knee) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 7

DB Avonte Maddox (back/illness) — upgraded from no practice

Decker hasn’t quite put his illness behind him, and his season-long shoulder injury is still keeping him on the injury report.

“The plan is to get Decker going,” Campbell said on Wednesday. “He wants to play. I mean, he wanted to play last week, but he looked like he was about six inches from the grave. It was unfortunate. But barring anything this week, he’ll be ready to go.”

Manu continues to work his way through the injury evaluation window. While there is no guarantee he is activated for the Lions’ final game, with the other injuries on the offensive line, they may need him for depth purposes.

Maddox missed last week’s game, but a return to practice is a good sign that he may be able to play against Chicago. With Harper’s status up in the air, the Lions would benefit from Maddox’s return to help stabilize a safety position that has been decimated by injury.

No longer on the injury report

RB David Montgomery (illness)

WR Tom Kennedy (abdomen)

C Graham Glasgow (knee)

EDGE Al-Quadin Muhammad (knee)

EDGE Marcus Davenport (shoulder)

CB Amik Robertson (hand)

CB Khalil Dorsey (illness)

The players in this section no longer have an ailment significant enough to keep them on the injury report.

After missing Week 16, Glasgow was healthy enough to be active in Week 17 but only enough to contribute in a reserve role. Now, with even more time to heal, Glasgow is “feeling a lot better,” according to Campbell, and is expected to return to his starting center role this Sunday.

Robertson has been dealing with a hand injury for nearly a month now, and his play has been limited, with him requiring a club on his hand to play. With him no longer needed to be listed on the injury report, it will be interesting to see if his role increases in Week 18.

As part of the move with placing Washington on IR, the team signed Jack Driscoll to the 53-man roster from the practice squad.
Driscoll, who was signed to the Steelers practice squad on Oct. 29, was elevated from the practice squad for the Week 15 game against the Miami Dolphins, Week 16 game against the Detroit Lions and Week 17 game against the Cleveland Browns.
Bell also spent time on the Philadelphia Eagles practice squad this year.
Also on the injury front, the Steelers could be getting several players back this week.","The Steelers began their preparation for Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens, practicing at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.

It's a game with everything on the line, as the winner takes it all in the AFC North.

And Coach Mike Tomlin is ready for it.

""Welcome to AFC North Championship Week,"" said Tomlin opening his weekly press conference on Tuesday.

In a week with everything on the line, you want every healthy body available to you.

One player who could be available is linebacker T.J. Watt. Watt was limited in practice on Wednesday.

Watt has slowly been working his way back from his health issue with his lung, and Tomlin said he is 'more optimistic' than he has been about Watt's availability.

""Optimistic about his potential inclusion in this game,"" said Tomlin. ""We'll work him up throughout the course of the week and let the amount of participation, the quality of participation, be our guide in terms of whether or not he's a participant.

""But certainly, I am more optimistic this week than I have been in previous weeks.""

Tomlin said they have proceeded with caution regarding Watt's return as he is coming off a medical issue.

""He's coming off of a medical circumstance, different than the injury circumstance,"" said Tomlin. ""And so, certainly he has a certain level of health.

""But we want to be cautious about how we work him back into the fold. And certainly, he's done the appropriate things in that area as well.""

Watt was limited in practice last week and Tomlin said his participation this week will have an impact on his availability, and he will utilize him however possible.

""Practice participation certainly would be more comforting in terms of making a decision given he's coming back from a medical circumstance,"" said Tomlin. ""I'm open to utilizing him in any way that's appropriate relative to his availability.""

Tomlin said he liked what he saw from Watt last week in practice.

""I thought he looked great,"" said Tomlin. ""I know he was glad to be out there with his teammates. I think that's a component of it that we don't talk often enough about when someone is injured or out. The isolation component of it.

""We're a communal group. This is a team sport definitively, and so more than anything, I thought he displayed an excitement that comes with being back out there with his teammates.""

While Watt has missed the last three games, Tomlin isn't concerned about him being in football shape when he does put the uniform back on.

""I doubt that T.J. is ever out of football shape or conditioning over the course of a 12 month calendar,"" said Tomlin. ""I know how he lives his life and how he prepares. How thoughtful he is in terms of what he puts in his body and how he trains.

""And so, I don't imagine that component being a major concern.""

While they could get Watt back, the team will be missing a key component on offense.

Tight end Darnell Washington, a weapon in the passing and running game as a blocker, and a key part of the Steelers version of the 'tush push,' was placed on the Reserve/Injured List on Wednesday after having surgery on his arm.

Washington brings a unique skillset, and size, to the offense, but Tomlin is comfortable with who they have to step in.

""We use a lot of tight ends,"" said Tomlin. ""We also use guys at the tight end position that don't play tight end, Spencer Anderson.

""So, we have a lot of options at our disposal relative to that from a strategy perspective. Certainly, given six or seven days to prepare, I don't think it would be a strategic issue in terms of replacing his efforts.""

As part of the move with placing Washington on IR, the team signed Jack Driscoll to the 53-man roster from the practice squad. Driscoll, who was signed to the Steelers practice squad on Oct. 29, was elevated from the practice squad for the Week 15 game against the Miami Dolphins, Week 16 game against the Detroit Lions and Week 17 game against the Cleveland Browns.

Driscoll was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fourth round of the 2020 NFL Draft.

He spent five seasons with the Eagles, appearing in 67 games, starting 18.

The team also signed tight end Jaheim Bell to the practice squad.

Bell was drafted by the New England Patriots in the seventh round of the 2024 NFL Draft out of Florida. He appeared in 15 games for the Patriots, with two receptions for 20 yards.

Bell also spent time on the Philadelphia Eagles practice squad this year.

Also on the injury front, the Steelers could be getting several players back this week.

""Thankfully, all other guys I'm about to mention have some level of optimism in terms of their availability,"" said Tomlin. ""Calvin Austin missed the last game with a hamstring, definitively has a chance. Brandin Echols, same thing with his groin. James Pierre, same thing with his calf. Isaac Seumalo, same thing with his triceps injury.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/steelers/w5u6v30xcbqoixcxu9xx,N,,2025-12-31 17:00:27.804861

Coming off a record-setting, back-and-forth win and facing another short week, Shanahan addressed injury updates, roster confidence, and the team's mindset heading into a high-stakes Week 18 matchup.

Here are the top takeaways from Shanahan following Sunday's win:

Injury Report

Shanahan opened with a cautious injury update as the team balances recovery with preparation following the Sunday night win.

Defensive lineman Keion White (groin), tackle Trent Williams (hamstring), fullback Kyle Juszczyk (hip), and running back Christian McCaffrey (back) did not practice on Wednesday. Shanahan emphasized McCaffrey's absence was precautionary, describing the issue as stiffness rather than a new injury.

""It's just stiff,"" Shanahan said. ""It was sore from Sunday night, so that's why we've got him on here today.""

Several players were limited, including cornerback Upton Stout (concussion protocol), tight end George Kittle (ankle), wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle), and defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos (knee). Shanahan confirmed cornerback Renardo Green is fully healthy and listed as a full participant.

With another short week, Shanahan cautioned against overinterpreting Wednesday's practice participation.

""We're barely moving today,"" he said. ""It's a walkthrough with the short week that we've got.""

Confidence in Pleasants

With Williams sidelined, Shanahan expressed confidence in offensive lineman Austen Pleasants, who stepped in during Sunday night's win and helped stabilize the offensive line during a game that had multiple momentum swings.

""Played good enough for us to win,"" Shanahan said. ""Real good in the run and pass game. He did a solid job.""

After reviewing the film, Shanahan highlighted that Pleasants' reliable performance, especially in primetime, spoke for itself.

""That's usually how it is for an O-Lineman. If you don't say their name much in a game, usually it's alright,"" Shanahan said. ""And when you matched it up with the tape, I thought he did a real good job… He really held his own.""

He also credited Pleasants' weekly Wednesday first-team reps while Williams takes his regular Vet Day, noting those opportunities have been crucial in preparing him for moments like Sunday night.

""That's why he was ready for that moment,"" Shanahan said. ""And I think he'll be even more ready this week.""

McCaffrey Sets the Standard

Coming off a historic night in which running back Christian McCaffrey set the franchise record for receptions by a running back, Shanahan acknowledged the toll December football can take, while also sharing that elite players typically elevate as the season goes on.

""Christian's pretty good every time I feel like he's in our uniform,"" Shanahan said. ""But good ones only get better as the year goes.""

Against the Bears, McCaffrey finished with 181 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown, remaining the league leader with 2,069 scrimmage yards as the postseason approaches.

Purdy Fuels Late-Season Momentum

Shanahan praised quarterback Brock Purdy's composure, highlighting his response after an early mistake as a true estimate to his demeanor.

""I just want him to keep being him,"" Shanahan said. ""Not hesitating on stuff. When he sees it, let it rip. I loved how he's been playing.""

Purdy threw for over 300 yards and led the game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter with a 38-yard touchdown to wide receiver Jauan Jennings.

""He didn't change at all,"" Shanahan said. ""Personality-wise, demeanor-wise… When he's confident and he sees it he lets it rip. If he doesn't, he gets rid of it, usually to a check down or he finds a way to make a play. So, keep being him and keep being aggressive.""

Defensive Depth Continuing

Shanahan highlighted the impact of improved depth along the defensive line, particularly with Gross-Matos back in the rotation as the season winds down.

""Just having nine guys, we can rotate better,"" Shanahan said. ""Having Ye out there, his talent, the way he plays, the numbers, it helps a lot.""

Shanahan also praised rookie defensive lineman Alfred Collins, highlighting his persistence after missing OTAs while working back from injury. Collins' ability to stay available throughout the season has been a key part of his development.

""He battled through that and got his stamina back up and was able to avoid an injury doing it. And to me that's what prepared him for the season and that's why he's been able to get through 17 weeks. I've been really happy with Alf so far,"" Shanahan said.

Week 1 Rematch for the Divisional Crown

Looking ahead, Shanahan said the team will revisit the Week 1 matchup against Seattle while accounting for subtle changes as both teams prepare to close the regular season.

""You always look at it,"" Shanahan said. ""But our teams are pretty similar from the beginning of the year to now.""

Shanahan discussed the challenge of defending Seahawks wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, praising his awareness within coverage.

""He almost plays in slow motion,"" Shanahan said, ""But he's one of the fastest guys out there.""

All In on the Regular-Season Finale

Despite already clinching a playoff spot, Shanahan made it clear there is no balancing act with postseason positioning at stake.

""Everyone's goal is to win a Super Bowl and in order to do that I would say it's easier to win three games than four games. You'd always rather play at home, no doubt about it… That's our goal. If that doesn't work out, we're excited to go on the road too.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/49ers/rgdmf7kkci6zmyavcklz,N,,2025-12-31 17:00:42.895288

On Wednesday, coach Jonathan Gannon ruled the Cardinals wide receiver out of Arizona's season finale against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday because of a left foot injury Harrison suffered in Sunday's loss at the Cincinnati Bengals.

Harrison had been dealing with a right heel injury that he suffered in Week 13 at Tampa Bay.

Harrison's season ends with 41 catches for 608 yards and four touchdowns.

Injuries defined Harrison's season. He played in just 12 games, missing two because of appendicitis surgery, two because of his heel and Sunday because of his foot.

""I thought he did some good things,"" Gannon said of Harrison. ""We moved him around the formation. He scored points for us. He got open, caught it. I don't think he has hit his ceiling and look forward to the future with that.""

Gannon didn't want to get into what it would take for Harrison to hit his ceiling.

""We'll talk about that later,"" Gannon said. ""I'm not in the mental space right now thinking about development of players as we move forward. I'm trying to stay focused on today in the Rams.""

Gannon said he was pleased with how Harrison played after adding 11 pounds of muscle last offseason.

""I thought that he made some contested catches because of some size,"" Gannon said. ""And we'll look at that in the future and see if that's the right thing.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0521%2Fr1496329_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 15:01:11.398674

“Chris Tanev’s gonna miss some time, significant time,” Leafs coach Craig Berube said Wednesday.
Berube said the 36-year-old suffered a groin injury in the third period of a Sunday night overtime loss in Detroit.
Still, the team did get a glimmer of hope with injured goaltender Anthony Stolarz on Wednesday morning.
While they’ve lost Tanev for an extended period, the Leafs may have fellow righty, Brandon Carlo, back soon.","TORONTO — The Maple Leafs updated the status of injured defenceman Chris Tanev, and it’s not good.

“Chris Tanev’s gonna miss some time, significant time,” Leafs coach Craig Berube said Wednesday.

Berube said the 36-year-old suffered a groin injury in the third period of a Sunday night overtime loss in Detroit. “Kind of a freak thing more than anything,” the coach said. “It’s one of those things that happens. It’s unfortunate for him. You feel for him, what he’s gone through this year.”

Tanev — who has played in only 11 games all season — has already had two separate (but related) injury-related absences, totalling 28 games.

The game he played on Sunday was only his third back in the lineup following an absence that began on Nov. 1.

“It’s tough,” Berube said. “He wants to be out there helping the team. It’s been hard on him.”

The Leafs are still determining a plan of care for Tanev.

Still, the team did get a glimmer of hope with injured goaltender Anthony Stolarz on Wednesday morning. Stolarz, 31, skated for the first time since he suffered an undisclosed injury in Boston more than seven weeks ago.

However, there remains no timetable for Stolarz’s return to the net.

The crease will continue to be manned for the foreseeable future by Joseph Woll and Dennis Hildeby.

Dakota Joshua, meanwhile, will remain in Detroit with family until the New Year before heading back to Toronto. Joshua suffered an internal injury to his kidney in Sunday’s game against the Red Wings and had to remain there in the aftermath.

He was doing “better,” according to Berube. “But again, he’s (going to miss) significant time.”

The injury news didn’t end there: Auston Matthews took part in an optional practice Wednesday morning and could be available to play on Thursday night against the Winnipeg Jets.

Matthews is expected to take part in the morning skate before a determination on his status is made.

“Hopefully he’s in there tomorrow,” Berube said.

The Leafs captain missed his team’s Tuesday night win over the New Jersey Devils with a foot injury.

Also sidelined for the game was the team’s leading scorer, William Nylander. Unlike Matthews, Nylander didn’t skate on Wednesday. He didn’t skate on Tuesday either and looks to be in jeopardy of missing a third straight game.

While they’ve lost Tanev for an extended period, the Leafs may have fellow righty, Brandon Carlo, back soon. Carlo continues to skate with the team and might be available to return Saturday in New York from a foot injury that’s kept him out since the middle of November.

“He’s close,” Berube said.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/31124439/GettyImages-2210609711-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-31 17:00:46.458873

The 49ers also hope to get tight end George Kittle back from injury, although there are other injury concerns.
Seattle is a bit banged up defensively, although that unit rebounded at Carolina by holding the Panthers to 139 yards last week with two turnovers.","Sam Darnold answered some of his critics in Week 16 with his late heroics against the Rams, which helped flip the divisional hierarchy and set up this winner-take-all game in Santa Clara. But in last week's win at Carolina, Darnold also lost a fumble, threw an interception and was lucky to have not had multiple other passes picked. The Seahawks have lived dangerously with their 28 turnovers this season, and Darnold has been responsible for 20 of those (14 INTs, six fumbles lost), with more turnovers (10) than touchdowns accounted for (eight) since Week 11. He's also been at the wheel of 27 victories the past two seasons, so Darnold is doing something right. If he can harness his playmaking ability while limiting turnovers, the Seahawks could be in great shape. The 49ers' pass rush has struggled, with only 18 sacks -- eight fewer than the next-lowest team. That could mean intermediate targets for the Seahawks' talented tight ends and deep shots for wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, especially off play action from the Seahawks' run game, although the status of WR Rashid Shaheed (concussion) is unclear.

There have been few hotter quarterbacks down the stretch than the 49ers' Brock Purdy, who has accounted for five TDs in each of his past two games, leading the team to 48- and 42-point outings. The Seahawks, on the flip side, are the second-best scoring defense in the NFL at 18.1 PPG allowed, with only two opponents able to top the 24-point mark against them this season. Purdy has leaned heavily on Christian McCaffrey down the stretch, as the All-Pro back is leading the team in rushing and receiving. The 49ers also hope to get tight end George Kittle back from injury, although there are other injury concerns. McCaffrey (back) missed practice this week, as did full back Kyle Juszczyk, and left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) could miss this game and could be rested for the playoffs, which would be a big loss in such a meaningful game.

That's especially true in a season like 2025, where it seems like there are no truly dominant teams and it feels like Super Bowl LX could be anyone's. So teams don't want the biggest problem on their roster rearing its ugly head in the most important games.

Below, I looked at weak spots for each of the 12 clinched playoff teams, plus both possible winners of the AFC North (Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens) and NFC South (Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers). Some of these stats are particularly concerning because of which squads these teams might face in the postseason. Others are less of a dilemma because prospective opponents are not strong in these particular areas.

Let's start with the Seattle Seahawks and go in order of Super Bowl chances via ESPN's Football Power Index (FPI).

Jump to:

49ers | Bears | Bills | Broncos

Bucs | Chargers | Eagles | Jaguars

Packers | Panthers | Patriots | Rams

Ravens | Seahawks | Steelers | Texans

Seattle Seahawks

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 13.4%

Concerning weakness: Covering tight ends

The Seahawks have the best defense in the league, according to DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average), and they rank fourth by FPI. So there's not a lot going wrong for that unit. But they do have a clear weakness in covering tight ends.

Once we adjust for the quality of the tight ends Seattle has faced, it ranks 29th in allowing 67 yards per game to the position. Obviously, that's a problem when the Seahawks' main rival is the Rams, who run 13 personnel (three tight ends) all the time. The Rams' tight ends combined for seven catches, 88 yards and a touchdown in Week 16 at Seattle.

Safety Nick Emmanwori has been highly regarded in his rookie season, but his coverage numbers against tight ends are not impressive. And the Seahawks might have to get through top tight ends such as the 49ers' George Kittle and the Eagles' Dallas Goedert if they want to make it to the Super Bowl.

Denver Broncos

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 12.1%

Concerning weakness: Defending slot receivers

Denver also has one of the NFL's best defenses this season, led by a vicious pass rush that leads the league in sacks (64). However, if opponents can get a pass off, they can take advantage of the Broncos' slot cornerbacks, Ja'Quan McMillian and Jahdae Barron.

Denver ranks only 27th in DVOA against passes to slot receivers, allowing 7.6 yards per attempt. The good news for the Broncos is that only two AFC playoff teams rank in the top 10 in the number of pass attempts to slot receivers this season: the Chargers and themselves.

Los Angeles Rams

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 11.4%

Concerning weakness: Short-yardage run defense

The Rams' run defense is interesting when it comes to the gains it does and does not allow. Ahead of their Week 17 Monday night loss, the Rams ranked third with 1.0 second-level yards allowed per carry, which is defined as gains that come between 5 and 10 yards after the line of scrimmage. They allow an NFL-best 0.3 open-field yards per carry, which is defined as gains that come 11 or more yards after the line of scrimmage. Preventing long runs is where the Rams shine.

Up front, however, Los Angeles has stuffed opposing running backs for a loss or no gain on only 12.2% of runs. Only Cincinnati is worse. That really becomes a problem when the opponent needs only a yard or two to move the chains or score. The Rams have allowed a conversion on 74% of short-yardage runs -- defined as third down, fourth down or the goal line with 1 to 2 yards to go (that ranks 26th).

It's not a good weakness to have against this playoff field. Most of the Rams' possible playoff opponents have converted short-yardage runs over 70% of the time this season, including Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, Carolina and Tampa Bay.

San Francisco 49ers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 10.5%

Concerning weakness: Lack of a pass rush

The 49ers have been hit by a ton of injuries. Most of the affected offensive players have returned to the lineup, unlike with the defense.

Among the players out for the season are edge rushers Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams, who both sustained torn ACLs. As a result, the 49ers have had almost no pass rush this season. They rank 29th in pass rush win rate (30%) and last in pressure rate (25%). As a result, the Niners are 25th in pass defense DVOA when they do not blitz. (They're 17th when they do blitz.)

Playing defense without much pass pressure puts more demand on quarterback Brock Purdy and the 49ers' offense to excel. So far, they've been able to do that.

Philadelphia Eagles

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 8.5%

Concerning weakness: Quarterback Jalen Hurts facing a blitz

For a long time, this would have been an easy choice to highlight Hurts' struggles against zone coverage. However, he has played better against zone in recent weeks. For the season, Hurts ranks 16th in DVOA against zone, which compares favorably with his rank of 13th against man coverage.

Instead, we should look at how Hurts has had trouble with extra pass rushers. He is 20th in DVOA against the blitz this season -- down to 30th if we look only at games since Week 10, with just 6.0 net yards per play. I'm not sure opponents have gotten the message here. Hurts has faced a 36% blitz rate this season, third in the NFL behind the Ravens' Lamar Jackson and the Commanders' Marcus Mariota. However, that rate has actually gone down to 28% since Week 10.

Most of the NFC playoff field is not particularly blitz-heavy, with the Buccaneers as the clear exception. But teams such as the Seahawks and Bears might blitz more if they know that's a weakness for Philadelphia.

New England Patriots

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 6.4%

Concerning weakness: Quarterback Drake Maye after his first read

Of course, Maye is a leading MVP candidate, and it is hard to find holes in his game -- but there is one. FTN Data tracks whether quarterbacks throw to their first read. On first-read throws, Maye ranks fifth in DVOA. However, if he has to go to a later read, Maye drops to 22nd.

The problem is getting him off his first read. Maye is one of the league's best quarterbacks against the blitz, and among quarterbacks who have played the full season, only Philly's Jalen Hurts and Seattle's Sam Darnold were knocked off their first read less often.

Among AFC playoff qualifiers, there are two teams that are above average at getting the opposing quarterback off his first read: the Steelers and the Jaguars. And while the Broncos are only average at forcing second reads, they have the best defensive DVOA when they do.

Green Bay Packers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 6.2%

Concerning weakness: Defending the pass on later downs

The Packers' pass defense has been outstanding on first down. It ranks third in DVOA and allows an NFL-low 5.1 net yards per dropback. The problem comes on later downs. On second, third and fourth downs, the Packers rank 26th in defensive DVOA and allow 5.9 net yards per dropback. It has been particularly bad since edge rusher Micah Parsons went down with a torn ACL, as the Packers have allowed 8.3 net yards per dropback on second through fourth downs in their past three games.

This is going to be a problem in the playoffs. On second down, three of the four best passing teams in the league are the Rams, Seahawks and 49ers. And the league's best passing teams on third down include the 49ers and Eagles.

Buffalo Bills

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 5.9%

Concerning weakness: Run defense

It's pretty clear that to beat the Bills, you must run on them. Buffalo's undersized defense ranks 31st in run defense DVOA. Is there a particular type of run that works best? No -- they all work.

Against runs marked by FTN Data as man blocking (iso, duo, power), the Bills allow a league-worst 5.8 yards per carry and are 29th in DVOA. Against runs marked as zone blocking, the Bills are better in yards per carry (4.9, which ranks 29th) but worse in DVOA (31st).

The good news for the Bills is that the run-heavy Colts missed the playoffs, and they handled the Steelers' running game in Week 13. But the Ravens would be a terrible matchup for them.

Houston Texans

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 5.8%

Concerning weakness: Offensive line

This one is very clear. Their offensive line ranks 30th in pass block win rate (55.4%) and 32nd in run block win rate (68.3%). And things have not improved over the course of the season. Since Week 10, the Texans are 31st in pass block win rate (54.2%), and they slightly improved to 30th in run block win rate (68.7%).

In addition, left tackle Aireontae Ersery and left guard Tytus Howard are among the most penalized players in the league. It's going to be an issue in the postseason against fierce pass rushes like those of the Broncos and possibly the Steelers, who each rank in the top five for pass rush win rate.

Jacksonville Jaguars

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 5.3%

Concerning weakness: Stagnating run game

The Jaguars are red-hot right now with a seven-game winning streak. Their passing game has been on fire since they acquired wide receiver Jakobi Meyers. And quarterback Trevor Lawrence is playing at the top of his game. The Jaguars ranked 21st in pass offense DVOA through Week 9, but since Week 10, they rank fifth.

However, the run game has completely slowed down. Jacksonville ranked sixth in DVOA through Week 9, but that dropped to 26th since Week 10. Not including scrambles, the Jaguars have dropped from 4.5 yards per carry to 3.7 yards per carry since Week 10. Speedy rookie Bhayshul Tuten should return from a finger injury by the playoffs, but Jacksonville really needs better blocking to stay on schedule when it runs the ball.

The Jaguars will need to produce on the ground against defenses like those of the Chargers and Bills, which are better against the pass than the run.

Los Angeles Chargers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 4.7%

Concerning weakness: Covering tight ends

The Chargers rank just 27th in DVOA against tight ends, and this has not improved in recent weeks. Opposing tight ends have a 77% catch rate against the Chargers since Week 9. The Chiefs' Travis Kelce and Eagles' Dallas Goedert each had 70-yard games against Los Angeles in recent weeks.

The problem is not the great safety Derwin James Jr. but rather when the Chargers end up with a linebacker in coverage. They'll need to avoid that when covering possible playoff opponents such as Broncos' Evan Engram, Patriots' Hunter Henry and Bills' Dalton Kincaid.

Baltimore Ravens

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 4.3%

Concerning weakness: Passing in the red zone

The Ravens have been awful this season when the field is condensed and there's less room to work with. Quarterback Lamar Jackson has been particularly bad, ranking last in both passing DVOA and EPA per dropback inside the 20-yard line.

With the injuries he has dealt with in 2025, Jackson hasn't had the mobility to do the magical things outside the pocket that have always given him an advantage in the red zone. And the Ravens don't exactly make up for it with a great running game, as they are only 19th in rush DVOA in the red zone.

The good news for Baltimore is that this season's best defenses in the red zone are primarily teams from the NFC playoff field. Denver (third) is a clear exception, but no other AFC team is in the top 10.

Chicago Bears

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 3.4%

Concerning weakness: Defending slot receivers

The Chicago defense has not been as strong as the Denver defense overall, but the Bears have the same weakness: defending against opposing slot receivers. Only the Jets allowed a worse DVOA to opposing slot receivers, and no other team has allowed more yards per attempt (9.1) or total touchdowns (13) than Chicago.

However, according to my coverage DVOA metric, the issue is not the main slot defender, C.J. Gardner-Johnson, who joined the team in Week 9. The problem is when opponents can get their slot receivers onto other defenders -- primarily cornerback Nick McCloud, safety Jaquan Brisker and linebacker Tremaine Edmunds.

Most of Chicago's prospective playoff opponents rank quite low in how often they throw to slot receivers, although Tampa Bay is an exception.

Pittsburgh Steelers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 1.2%

Concerning weakness: Dependence on short passes

At age 42, quarterback Aaron Rodgers does not have the arm he once had, and the Steelers' passing game is designed around getting the ball out fast. Rodgers has an average depth of target of just 6.1 yards, tied with the Browns' Dillon Gabriel for the shortest in the league this season. Rodgers has thrown 86% of his passes at 15 air yards or shorter, second behind Gabriel in this case.

Why does this matter? First, the Steelers haven't been particularly efficient in this short passing game. Rodgers' DVOA on these passes is slightly below the NFL average. Second, most of the AFC playoff field is very strong against short passes. The top 10 defenses against short passes include Houston, Jacksonville and Buffalo. The Broncos and Chargers are also above average.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 0.6%

Concerning weakness: Defense has fallen apart

We don't need to focus on a single down, type of coverage or even an aspect of the Tampa Bay defense. The whole thing has fallen apart over the past few weeks.

Through Week 8, the Bucs' defensive DVOA was eighth against the pass and sixth against the run. Since their Week 9 bye, the Bucs are 27th against the pass and 22nd against the run. Over that same time period, they have dropped from fourth to 17th in pass rush win rate (35.3%). Their run stop win rate is about the same, but the Bucs have allowed more yardage at the second and third levels.

There haven't been big personnel changes -- just an overall decline. And it might cost Tampa Bay a playoff spot.

Carolina Panthers

FPI chance to win Super Bowl: 0.5%

Concerning weakness: Third-down defense

The Panthers' defense has a very hard time getting off the field. Carolina ranks 15th on first down by DVOA and 13th on second down. Yet it ranks 31st on third down, ahead of only the Cowboys. If you prefer more conventional stats, the Panthers rank 31st in conversion rate allowed on third downs; opponents move the sticks 46.7% of the time against them on third down and 63.6% of the time on fourth down.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1230%2Fr1594994_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 15:01:21.835696

""I'll know when I get out there and see, but right now I'm just treating it like a normal game,"" Evans said.
Evans was forced to miss six games this season with a broken collarbone -- the first broken bone of his career.
And they told me I would have a chance to play at the end of the season,"" Evans said.
Last week at the Miami Dolphins, Evans became the 22nd player in NFL history to reach 13,000 receiving yards.","TAMPA, Fla. -- Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans said Tuesday that he hasn't thought about his future beyond Saturday's regular-season finale hosting the Carolina Panthers, a game the Bucs must win, in addition to needing the New Orleans Saints to defeat the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, to reach the playoffs.

The franchise's leading career scorer, who is 32 and finishing his 12th season, is not under contract next year and hasn't committed to playing beyond 2025, although he has long said he wants to finish his career with Tampa Bay.

""I just approach it how I always approach it,"" Evans said. ""It's whatever happens, happens. I'll focus on that when the time is right. Right now, we have to win. And I'm always giving my all and I'm always gonna go out swinging.""

It certainly has the makings of a super sendoff if he wanted it that way, with the exception of the team's current predicament -- losing seven of its past eight games and needing some help to reach the playoffs. The team is giving the first 13,000 fans bobbleheads of Evans, in his No. 13 jersey, doing his signature celebratory salute.

He joked about the youthful depiction of his bobblehead's hair, much more reminiscent of his as a 20-year-old seventh overall draft pick out of Texas A&M. Now he's a married father of four with six Pro Bowl selections to his name and a Super Bowl LV ring and has become one of the most celebrated players in the team's history, with fans even tattooing his image and his autograph to their bodies.

He's not sure whether there will be emotions.

""I'll know when I get out there and see, but right now I'm just treating it like a normal game,"" Evans said. ""And obviously we have to win it and do our part and cheer another team on Sunday.""

Coach Todd Bowles echoed that when asked Tuesday about the possibility of it being not just Evans' last game but also that of inside linebacker Lavonte David.

""I think we need to win because we need to win,"" Bowles said. ""The fact that it could be or could not be their last game is not even talked about at this time.""

Evans was forced to miss six games this season with a broken collarbone -- the first broken bone of his career. He also missed three games with a hamstring strain. That ended his streak of 1,000-yard seasons at 11, tying him for first with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice. It was a career record Evans wanted to gain sole possession of this year, and he had Rice's blessing to do so, but then the collarbone injury hit.

After that, all he could think about was getting back. The team struggled in his absence.

""I mean, when the injury happened, you hear 'broken bone,' you think 'out for the season.' And they told me I would have a chance to play at the end of the season,"" Evans said. ""So I was trying to expedite that process -- rehab extremely hard, the training staff did a great job, and I was able to come back. And that's one thing I've always prided myself in. If I'm healthy enough to play, I'm going to play. Like, I'm paid to play football, and the fans are wearing my jerseys in the stands to watch me play. So I just made a point to get back as fast as I could.""

But it gave him a sneak preview of what retirement would be like. He found himself longing for the joy of playing.

""It's kind of a blessing in disguise,"" Evans said. ""I missed the game more than I thought I would. And I come back and I still got the love for the game. And who knows what it'll do for me in the future?""

Last week at the Miami Dolphins, Evans became the 22nd player in NFL history to reach 13,000 receiving yards. He is also one of just nine players in league history with at least 850 receptions, 13,000 receiving yards and 100 touchdown receptions in their career, joining Rice, Tim Brown, Cris Carter, Tony Gonzalez, Marvin Harrison, Randy Moss, Terrell Owens and Larry Fitzgerald.

""It was looking tough this year, but thank God that I was able to come back and get healthy and get that,"" Evans said. ""That's elite company, man. That's something I've never even dreamed of doing. So I thank God for it. ...""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1018%2Fr1562232_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 15:59:44.479256

Could an injury prevent him from playing in the regular season finale? The star running back has managed to avoid those issues all season long, but he popped up on the injury report with a back ailment ahead of Week 18.

Early indications are that it's just a stiff back for McCaffrey and the overall concern appears to be minimal. Regardless, his status is now in question for the team's matchup against the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday, Jan. 3.

The No. 1 seed in the NFC is on line in San Francisco and all eyes are now on the health of McCaffrey.

Here's the latest on the 49ers running back.

Christian McCaffrey injury update

McCaffrey missed practice on Tuesday, Dec. 30 with a stiff back.

The running back has routinely missed the first official practice of the week all season for rest-related reasons. Given his injury history, it appears San Francisco has been doing everything in its power to ensure the star would be fresh for a postseason run.

Head coach Kyle Shanahan didn't seem too concerned about the injury for McCaffrey, telling reporters on Dec. 30 that it's only a stiff back. The coach added that it was an ailment that popped up against the Tennessee Titans on Dec. 14.

""I know he battled it hard that week, but I haven't heard anything about it since,"" Shanahan said. ""It might have stiffened up in the game, and it was sore from Sunday night, so that's why we've got him on here today.""

Shanahan indicated that the team has been holding walkthrough practices since their Week 18 contest against the Seahawks comes on a short week.

Injuries have been a problem for the 49ers throughout the 2025 season, but McCaffrey doesn't appear to be in danger of missing the regular season finale at this time.

That concern will ramp up if he continues to be sidelined though.

Ford, 27, recorded 13 tackles (one for loss) while playing 173 defensive snaps for the Bears over 12 games.
Here are five things to know about the Packers' newest defensive lineman: Ford was one of Green Bay's four seventh-round picks in 2022.
Despite spending two-plus seasons in Green Bay, Ford never appeared in a game for the Packers.
After being elevated for three games, Ford was signed back to the 53 on Oct. 25.","GREEN BAY – Welcome back Jonathan Ford.

The Packers claimed the 6-foot-5, 338-pound defensive tackle off waivers from Chicago after losing Jordon Riley to a season-ending Achilles injury during Saturday's loss to Baltimore.

Ford, 27, recorded 13 tackles (one for loss) while playing 173 defensive snaps for the Bears over 12 games.

Here are five things to know about the Packers' newest defensive lineman:

Ford was one of Green Bay's four seventh-round picks in 2022.

Taken with the 234th overall pick, Ford was part of a fruitful 11-player draft class for Green Bay that included linebacker Quay Walker, defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt, receivers Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs, and starting offensive linemen Rasheed Walker, Zach Tom and Sean Rhyan.

Ford shared his seventh-round selection with Walker (249), safety Tariq Carpenter (228) and receiver Samori Toure (258).

Ford and former college teammate Jonathan Garvin (seventh round, 2020) are the only defensive players whom the Packers have drafted out of the University of Miami (Fla.).

Despite spending two-plus seasons in Green Bay, Ford never appeared in a game for the Packers.

Green Bay was both deep and durable on the defensive interior during Ford's time here. A healthy scratch throughout his rookie season, Ford spent the 2023 season on the Packers' practice squad without being activated to the gameday roster.

Ford garnered high praise from the Packers during training camp in 2024 before injuring his calf in the preseason finale. Still, the Packers thought enough of Ford's ability to place him on injured reserve with a designation to return during final cuts.

He was activated on Oct. 21, 2024, but immediately released and re-signed to the Packers' practice squad. The Bears signed Ford to their 53-man roster near the end of a five-win season.

Ford got his first chance to see the field in Chicago.

The monstrous defensive tackle made a solid first impression when he racked up five tackles (one for loss) in his debut against the Minnesota Vikings on Dec. 16, 2024.

Chicago re-signed Ford in January after finishing with nine tackles on 77 defensive snaps in the Bears' final four games.

He didn't make Chicago's initial 53-man roster this past summer but signed to the practice squad the following day. After being elevated for three games, Ford was signed back to the 53 on Oct. 25.

Ford was a healthy scratch during the Bears' two December meetings with Green Bay. He was waived on Saturday to enable Chicago to activate rookie guard Luke Newman off IR.

He has prototypical makeup as a run-stopper.

Ford's size was his calling card coming into the NFL. With Wyatt (ankle) and Riley both out for the season, Ford gives the Packers another option on the interior after giving up 307 rushing yards in a 41-24 loss to the Ravens last Saturday.

During the NFL Draft process, NFL.com's Lance Zierlein praised Ford for his knock-back power, quickness off the snap and ability to penetrate the backfield for a man his size.

But the annual coaching carousel is also on deck, and we could see a lot of movement there as teams hit the offseason.

Insiders Jeremy Fowler and Dan Graziano have been calling sources around the NFL for the latest news and buzz on key coaching situations heading into Week 18. Are there any updates on the open Giants and Titans spots? Which other coaching gigs could come open in the next few days? Who are the top candidates to get hired -- from both inside and outside the NFL?

Jeremy and Dan poked around for the latest there, and they even broke down a few general manager hot seats around the league. It's all here, as our national reporters answer big questions and empty their notebooks heading into Week 18.

More notes on Week 18

What are you hearing on potential jobs that could come open over the next seven days?

Graziano: My sense is that a lot of people are watching Las Vegas for the potential that Pete Carroll is one-and-done with the Raiders. This season has gone quite poorly, and they seem to be positioning themselves for the No. 1 draft pick, so the theory is they might want someone else around to develop that selection if it's a quarterback.

Atlanta still seems like a spot to watch, given how far short of expectations the Falcons have fallen with Raheem Morris. I'm hearing conflicting things on Miami; for a while it sounded as if Mike McDaniel was a good bet to stay, but lately the winds seem to have shifted a bit on that, so we'll see where that lands. Cleveland is a spot people are keeping an eye on, with the idea that Kevin Stefanski could be a head coach candidate elsewhere if the Browns do move on. And some are wondering what Tampa Bay might do if the Bucs don't win Sunday to salvage their season. Otherwise ... I'm not sure. What do you think about Arizona?

Fowler: That one is complicated, because some within the coaching staff are cautiously optimistic that Jonathan Gannon will get a fourth year, and some within the coaching industry see a path to Gannon potentially staying. Owner Michael Bidwill likes Gannon and can attribute the rough season to injuries and the lack of a hand-picked quarterback for the head coach. The flip side is Arizona is so far away from the other three teams in the NFC West and simply isn't competitive right now.

On the Bucs, Todd Bowles' buyout would be hefty after the team extended his contract through 2028, and the team doesn't seem overly eager to pay that. Bailing on Bowles would be the Bucs' way of embracing a rebuild. But someone will have to pay if they lose to Carolina. Staff changes are not off the table either way.

We're in the same spot on the other jobs you mentioned, and Cincinnati's Zac Taylor appears to be safe. Morris has helped himself a bit over the past three games, but I'm not sure it's enough. That leaves us with the surprise category. I can't help but envision teams with current or future openings watching the Baltimore-Pittsburgh game wondering whether John Harbaugh or Mike Tomlin could somehow become available. That's not my expectation, to be sure, but the chatter won't quite dissipate.

Graziano: That chatter is out there, but I've heard nothing from inside either building to indicate either team is contemplating a change. Most of the speculation seems to stem from fan discontent, and neither the Steelers nor the Ravens are the type of organization to make compulsive decisions based on fan discontent.

That said, one of those teams is going to miss the playoffs and the other is going to be the weakest team in the AFC playoff field. The Ravens had the very highest of hopes for this season, and the Steelers always expect to contend. So there will be disappointment to be addressed in both places. Count me among those who would be extremely surprised if Tomlin and Harbaugh aren't back in their current jobs next season. But I don't believe either organization has had real conversations yet about the future of their respective coaches.

Fowler: Harbaugh has three years left on his contract, so I don't anticipate him initiating an exit. But there is at least some intrigue leaguewide about whether Harbaugh and owner Steve Bisciotti could have big-picture talks about the future at some point. In other words, I'm not totally getting shut out when I knock on those doors. It's also noteworthy that Harbaugh's mentor is Andy Reid, who had a successful second stint in the NFL when he left Philadelphia. Perhaps that blueprint is not lost on Harbaugh. It could be nothing, but Sunday's game is intriguing beyond the score.

Graziano: If Tomlin or Harbaugh were cut loose, either would certainly top the wish list of just about any team with an opening. But if not, what do you think about the chances of someone such as Stefanski or McDaniel latching on quickly with another team as head coach if they're let go in Cleveland or Miami, respectively? If the Browns are of a mind to make a move, is it possible they could look to work out a trade that sends Stefanski elsewhere, since he has years left on his deal? I'm just trying to spitball out-of-the-ordinary scenarios here.

Fowler: Stefanski might be the strongest retread candidate in the eyes of many. The Giants would be an ideal fit. And trades of any kind are never off the table in Cleveland, but it'd be tricky trying to trade a coach who's 7-26 over the past two years. And here's something funny: My sense is that McDaniel would be a candidate in Cleveland, should the Dolphins move on and Cleveland's job open. He still has some support in Miami. We will see if that's enough. He has made a case to stay. From what I've gathered, the Dolphins' GM search won't necessarily be centered around fitting with McDaniel; it's more so about finding the best team fit in general.

One more: Some folks around the league have wondered to me whether Bills ownership might grow impatient with Sean McDermott if Buffalo doesn't make a playoff run in a year Patrick Mahomes is out of the postseason.

Which candidate do you believe most strongly will get a head coaching job this cycle?

Fowler: There are several options here. The field is as wide open as I can remember. It's missing the proverbial golden goose, eliciting several different answers from industry sources over the past few weeks. Former or recently fired head coaches could be happy with this cycle, and interview quality will absolutely matter. But I'll go with Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley. He's part of the cluster of strong defensive-minded candidates this cycle. He seems to have some traction in New York, too. I've heard his name linked to the Giants job a few times in my calls over the past week, and I expect him to be on their list. Hafley is also a geographical fit as a Montvale, New Jersey, native.

Graziano: The name that jumped to my mind is Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, who I believe will be on a lot of lists. That Sean McVay pixie dust has been the key for a lot of guys getting their first head coaching shot, and Shula could be next. I could see him being of interest in Tennessee if he brings the right offensive coordinator with him for quarterback Cam Ward's development. I also think Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph will get another shot, with Miami and Las Vegas both strong possibilities for a variety of reasons if those teams decide to make changes.

Fowler: Shula has that Rams tree, coaches an opportunistic defense in L.A. and has long been on the league's internal radar as an emerging candidate. That's a good formula. We outlined a few weeks back the reasons Joseph is well positioned, and Joseph and 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh acquitted themselves well with the Raiders during last year's cycle. Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, Jaguars defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile and Texans defensive coordinator Matt Burke are poised to score their first interviews. Seattle's Aden Durde could land in that group, too.

One thing this cycle has in spades is defense. It's lacking a bit on offense. I'm expecting Kansas City offensive coordinator Matt Nagy to be in the mix in Tennessee (and possibly elsewhere). Seattle offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak and Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Brady have earned interview chances but aren't considered runaway prospects at this point. Stefanski and Kliff Kingsbury might be involved. It wouldn't surprise to see Bengals offensive coordinator Dan Pitcher on the interview circuit. And a sleeper candidate is Rams pass game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase, who could have some action. What do you make of that side of the ball, Dan?

Graziano: I've heard Nagy's name a lot; it was thrown around in connection with the Titans job seemingly within the first few minutes after Brian Callahan was fired. I agree that Kubiak is one to watch and think he might get more interviews than some might expect him to get. Brady would be the guy to watch in Cincinnati if the Bengals did move on from Taylor, but like you, I don't expect that to happen. The relative lack of top offensive candidates is the thing that makes me wonder whether Kingsbury gets some attention or even Mike McCarthy gets some looks, though I haven't heard anything solid on teams being interested in the latter.

Who is the most interesting head coach candidate not currently in the NFL?

Graziano: I really struggled with this one, as did most of the people to whom I spoke. Jon Gruden? That's complicated by a ton of factors, including his pending litigation against the league. I'm not sure McCarthy gets another shot, but he could get some looks. College guys don't seem to be very hot right now. I never thought Notre Dame's Marcus Freeman was getting serious interest, but good for him for getting a raise out of the whole thing. I just haven't heard much on who could be this year's, say, Pete Carroll.

Fowler: It wouldn't shock me if teams wanted to speak with Gruden, assuming his lawsuit will reach a conclusion at some point. In a year with limited offensive options, this would be the time. His imprint is still all over the NFL coaching landscape. McCarthy would be a key figure in this equation, too. Out of the retread options, he seems well positioned. That doesn't mean he'll get a job, but I do expect him to interview.

Texas coach Steve Sarkisian publicly denying any NFL interest back in October doesn't necessarily end the conversation. He has deep NFL ties after stints with the Falcons and Raiders over the years, and he could easily gauge the market without being directly involved.

Graziano: Who knows? There are always surprises. I'd be saying Bill O'Brien, who was a successful NFL head coach once upon a time, if he hadn't had such a lousy season at Boston College. The Bears gave Eddie George an interview last cycle. Would the Titans do the same? Could the Giants give Antonio Pierce a call two years after his brief stint with the Raiders and bring back their legendary linebacker?

Fowler: Here's a college sleeper ... Bret Bielema. He has won 19 games over the past two seasons as Illinois' head coach, and he spent three years as an NFL assistant between collegiate head coaching stints, so I believe the pros is still attractive to him. He's an outside-the-box idea, but anything goes this cycle.

What about the general managers: Who has the hottest front-office seat right now?

Fowler: Falcons owner Arthur Blank will evaluate the team's football operation at the conclusion of the season. General manager Terry Fontenot is finishing his fifth year at the helm. Over that time, the Falcons have not produced a winning season, which is hard to overcome. Of the 18 sitting general managers with at least five years of experience, only one -- the Rams' Les Snead, in the middle of a move from St. Louis to Los Angeles -- failed to produce a winning season through the first five years. So this is a spot people around the league who follow such things have been monitoring closely for potential change, despite the team showing signs of life in recent weeks and its 2025 draft picks emerging.

Graziano: For sure. Again, that team had high expectations the past two years and has not come close to meeting them. Blank is eager to win as soon as possible and might not be patient with this group.

I was in Indianapolis on Sunday, and no one there seems to know for sure where things are headed following the Colts' late-season collapse. GM Chris Ballard has a good relationship with owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon, from what I am told, and while the Anthony Richardson Sr. pick seems to have been a miss, the Daniel Jones signing was a hit until he got hurt. I think Ballard sticks around, but people are asking about him a lot these days.

Fowler: Ballard remains a moving target because he drafts well and builds good rosters -- but no division titles in nine years is a tough sell. I've talked to a few people in the league who wonder whether Ballard would be the first to go over coach Shane Steichen if Irsay-Gordon makes changes at all. But the Colts had a good thing going for 10 games before the injuries, so that factors in, too. Most people I've talked to are leaning toward Ballard's job being safe.

With other spots, some of the people I've talked to believe Cardinals general manager Monti Ossenfort will ultimately be safe. Browns general manager Andrew Berry has been operating like someone who will be back, and that's my sense of what will happen. His successful 2025 draft was carefully crafted with 2026 in mind, and he has had the freedom to negotiate extensions with veterans.

Graziano: That all lines up with what I'm hearing. I haven't been told anything to indicate Berry would be in trouble. A couple of people I talk to are still watching the Giants, who said after coach Brian Daboll's midseason firing that GM Joe Schoen would lead the coaching search but haven't done much besides lose games since then. Schoen seems to be pretty well aligned with the other decision-makers in the Giants' building from what I can gather, but the team's record during his tenure is poor enough that eyeballs are on this situation. Some people wonder whether this could turn out the way the Jaguars' situation did last offseason, when Jacksonville said GM Trent Baalke would lead the coaching search and then ended up firing him to entice Liam Coen to take the head coach job.

What else are you hearing this week?

Fowler's notes:

• The Ravens' playoff hopes are still alive, but this season has been challenging, raising questions about whether some level of change is coming after the season. Harbaugh has never been afraid to make staff changes when necessary. Some people around the league are watching defensive coordinator Zach Orr's status closely after Baltimore fell from 10th to 25th in total defense since 2024.

Offensive coordinator Todd Monken's future is complicated because he's known as a skilled coach, his contract was extended in the offseason, and he has interviewed for head-coaching jobs. He also was a person of interest during the Michigan coaching search that ultimately landed on Kyle Whittingham. But the offense has fallen from first to 16th in yards, and questions exist about the chemistry between Monken and quarterback Lamar Jackson. The usage of Derrick Henry has been a source of frustration at times, too. Either way, something could come to a head with the staff. Of course, Baltimore is dangerous if it can get into the playoffs with a win Sunday in Pittsburgh, and a spirited late-season run could silence all of this noise. But there is noise.

• The Falcons have not quit on Morris, who has railed off three consecutive wins to make his case for a third year in Atlanta. But that doesn't ensure his return. Morris would most likely need to make staff changes if he does stay. Special teams has been a bugaboo, and quarterback Michael Penix Jr.'s development hasn't proceeded as hoped.

• There is talk in some league circles about the future of Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard. The offense has tanked of late, and Baker Mayfield has regressed in the second half of the season. Some level of change is needed after this year's late-season collapse, which is at least somewhat injury-driven. The Bucs are playing with third-string offensive guards, and the running game hasn't been quite the same. Grizzard is well respected and helped former coordinator Liam Coen with game planning last season, but the Bucs' offense can't stop the slide.

• League sources consider it likely that Washington makes a change at defensive coordinator after Joe Whitt Jr. was stripped of playcalling duties earlier this season. The Commanders are 31st in total defense. Injuries and a lack of pass rush personnel have contributed, but coach Dan Quinn faces a critical third season in Washington and appears poised to make changes. Quinn has been calling the defense; whether he continues to do so will depend on an offseason review.

• With a weaker pool of offensive candidates for head-coaching jobs, I expect several up-and-coming non-playcallers to get looks for more prominent playcalling jobs or even head-coaching opportunities. We know the drill: Oftentimes a team will interview a coach for a head-coaching position with the back-pocket thought to pair that coach as a coordinator for the head coach it really wants. This year's group of young offensive coaches working behind a skilled playcaller is deep -- including the Jaguars' Grant Udinski, Bears' Declan Doyle, Panthers' Brad Idzik and Broncos' Davis Webb. There are many others, but those coaches fit a younger mold and could surprise some people.

• Kingsbury's head-coaching candidacy is interesting despite Washington's struggles. The Commanders rank 21st in total offense -- ahead of Tampa Bay, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh -- despite a poor supporting cast ravaged by injury. He's a potential fit in Tennessee, with a young quarterback in Cam Ward who fits his style of offense. Las Vegas, should that job open as many around the league expect, will take a hard look at improving its offense. Kingsbury has been selective but is also open to becoming a head coach again. So while he's not the shiniest name because of Washington's record, I could see him being in the mix again.

• Former Giants coach Brian Daboll should be a viable offensive coordinator option for teams looking to hire one. He could get head-coaching interviews, as well. He has significant playcalling experience and did some good things with Jaxson Dart before his November firing.

• Names that come up fairly often for the general manager cycle include Green Bay vice president of player personnel Jon-Eric Sullivan and Indianapolis assistant general manager Ed Dodds. They have significant personnel experience. Also, Chicago assistant GM Ian Cunningham has been a fixture on the scene and has helped build Chicago into a winner. The same goes for assistant GMs Terrance Gray (Buffalo), Alec Halaby (Philadelphia) and Chad Alexander (L.A. Chargers). Another candidate to watch through the Eagles system is vice president of football operations and strategy Adam Berry.

• The Rams are feeling the urgency after back-to-back losses. As defensive lineman Kobie Turner put it, teams have trouble hanging with the Rams when they are at their best, but that's not often enough. ""We've got to get ourselves together,"" he said after Monday night's loss in Atlanta. Part of the reason the team isn't panicking: The Sean McVay-Matthew Stafford relationship that is thriving in Year 5. Stafford has embraced more under-center play and with multiple tight ends on the field. Even during his worst game (intercepted three times by the Falcons' defense), he was well on his way to 350 or so yards if not for penalties or plays negated by official review.

""The offense presents things that look the same but are different for the defense -- I think that bodes really well for us moving forward,"" tight end Colby Parkinson said. ""These will set us up for success.""

Graziano's notes:

• Anthony Campanile is worth watching; the Jags' defensive coordinator could get interviews this cycle and a head-coaching job down the road. People around the league are taking note of what has happened in Jacksonville and how quickly Coen and his relatively inexperienced staff have turned things around. The Jaguars have the league's best run defense in yards allowed per game, and they trail only the Bears with 30 takeaways.

The turnaround in Jacksonville is across-the-board impressive. QB Trevor Lawrence's confidence is sky-high thanks in part to a couple of midseason moves by the coaching staff and the front office. Coen and his staff used the team's Week 8 bye to drill down on what they believed Lawrence liked and didn't like in the offense and focus on what they could do to keep building it around his strengths and preferences.

""The biggest difference I see is Trevor running out of the pocket, using his legs and then just ripping the ball,"" Jags offensive lineman Cole Van Lanen told me. ""He's making decisions he might not have made in the past, I'm talking about in a good way, and it's really elevated the offense.""

The front office, around that same time, acquired wide receiver Jakobi Meyers in a trade with the Raiders. Using first-round picks on wideouts two years in a row and paying Dyami Brown $10 million in free agency might have made most teams reluctant to make this kind of move, given the amount of high-end resources already sunk into the position. But the Jags knew they had a very specific problem -- namely a league-leading number of drops -- that the sure-handed Meyers could help them correct. His addition changed their offense, moving 2024 first-rounder Brian Thomas Jr. into a role he was more comfortable with and allowing Parker Washington to shine. And the team rewarded Meyers with a contract extension shortly after the trade. What that means for the future of their WR position once Travis Hunter comes back is a discussion for another day. (Hunter, remember, can do other things!)

GM James Gladstone and vice president of football operations Tony Boselli deserve a lot of credit for a smart, aggressive deadline deal that has Jacksonville in position to win its division and potentially still get the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs in what a lot of front offices might have been content to view as a rebuilding year. I was a skeptic about Jacksonville's 2025 chances after visiting the team in training camp, but the Jaguars already posted their first 12-win season in 20 years (and third in franchise history). They've won in Denver, they split with Houston, and they're beating the teams they're supposed to beat. In a wide-open, Chiefs-free AFC playoff field ... why not?

• Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said he was optimistic about edge rusher T.J. Watt returning for Sunday night's game against Baltimore. Watt, who had surgery three weeks ago to repair a partially collapsed lung, was a limited practice participant all three days last week, which was an encouraging sign. But people close to this situation have cautioned me that the Steelers aren't treating this as a run-of-the-mill injury recovery (which it's not) and they likely will want to see Watt get through multiple full practices before activating him for the game, even as vital as it is to their season. So watch the practice reports this week to get a sense of Watt's chances to go.

• Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson's status for that same game is very much up in the air, as the team entered the week with no idea how much (if anything) Jackson would be able to do in Wednesday, Thursday and Friday practices. We might have some clues by Wednesday, if Jackson is able to get out on the field for practice and move around OK with the back injury that cost him last week's game. But it's no sure thing he'll be able to answer the bell for Sunday night, and I'd expect Tyler Huntley to get some first-team reps this week either way, just in case.

• Niners left tackle Trent Williams is dealing with a pulled hamstring, and while coach Kyle Shanahan declined to rule him out Tuesday for Saturday night's game, Williams is 37 and hasn't had this injury before, and the team is playing on a short week. He's probably a long shot to play against the Seahawks in a game that will decide the NFC West title and the conference's top seed.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1230%2Fr1594995_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 11:00:48.228997

NFC WEEK 18 MOTIVATION RATINGS

Here is more context and quotes on the Week 18 motivation:

AFC

1. Broncos (13-3)

SITUATION: A Denver win locks them into the top seed in the AFC.

OUTLOOK: This is pretty simple. There is only one bye available, and it is for the top seed in the conference. The Broncos control their own destiny and will be all-out to beat the Chargers Week 18.

2. Patriots (13-3)

SITUATION: The Patriots could get to the No. 1 seed with a win and a Denver loss. They could also fall to the No. 3 seed with a loss and a Jacksonville win. Otherwise, they are the No. 2 seed.

OUTLOOK: While New England technically has a shot at the top seed, it would require the Broncos to lose to a Chargers team resting their starters. Mike Vrabel stated that starters will play if healthy: “Probably everybody who’s healthy will play,” Vrabel said. “I mean, that’s just where we’re at, and I haven’t looked too far into it this morning here. But I would anticipate everybody who’s healthy will play in the football game.”

Note that the Patriots and Broncos both play at 425pm ET in Week 18. We could see some scoreboard watching from Vrabel — if the Broncos are in trouble, the Pats should go all-out to win.

3. Jaguars (12-4)

SITUATION: Jacksonville locks up the AFC South with a win on Sunday. A loss would open up the Texans to steal it.

OUTLOOK: The Jaguars should go all out to win the division, and earn a home game in the first round of playoffs.

4. Steelers (9-7) and 9. Ravens (8-8)

SITUATION: Pittsburgh plays Baltimore for the AFC North crown. The loser is out of the playoffs.

OUTLOOK: Both teams will be going all out to try to make the postseason.

5. Texans (11-5)

SITUATION: Houston can still win the AFC South with a win and a Jaguars loss. Otherwise, a win keeps them at the No. 5 seed.

OUTLOOK: The Texans should be going all out for this game. Even if Jacksonville (which plays at the same time) were to win their game, Houston has a lot of incentive to keep their position at No. 5 in the AFC. It is the difference between facing the AFC North winner and a team with 12+ wins.

6. Chargers (11-5)

SITUATION: Los Angeles is locked into a Wild Card spot. They can’t get higher than the 6 seed.

OUTLOOK: The Chargers have relatively nothing to play for, and could use a week to get healthy. Jim Harbaugh has acknowledged this and has already stated that Trey Lance is expected to start instead of Justin Herbert. We expect other starters to sit as well.

7. Bills (11-5)

SITUATION: Buffalo is locked into a Wild Card spot.

OUTLOOK: The Bills are only playing for seeding, and head coach Sean McDermott appears conflicted so far: “Where do you want to start? We’ve got a lot of things we need to discuss as a leadership group,” McDermott said. “You’ve got the last game in Highmark Stadium here. That’s important to me; it’ll be important to our guys, to our staff. Then there are other things that come into consideration. It won’t be easy, but it is important that we have a good week here.”

It is worth noting that Josh Allen finished Week 17 with an injury, which could outweigh any seeding or momentum goals for Week 18. It’s also worth noting that the Bills could beat the pathetic Jets without playing their starters a ton.

JUST ELIMINATED IN WEEK 17

* Colts — expected to start Riley Leonard in Week 18. Expecting other evaluation spots.

BEEN ELIMINATED

* Raiders, Jets, Titans, Browns, Chiefs, Bengals, and Dolphins

NFC

1. Seahawks (13-3) and 5. 49ers (12-4)

SITUATION: This game will determine who wins the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the conference.

OUTLOOK: Both teams will be going all out, as this game has massive playoff ramifications.

2. Bears (11-5)

SITUATION: Chicago locks up the No. 2 seed with a win on Sunday. They cannot fall farther than No. 3.

OUTLOOK: The Bears need a win over the Lions to avoid the NFC West teams in the first round of the playoffs. Ben Johnson indicated they will play for the No. 2 seed: “Yeah, we’re playing to win this week.” We are inclinced to believe him for now — there is a difference between facing the Packers and facing one of Rams/Seahawks/49ers. Dan Campbell is likely to match fire with fire, and we should expect a legit game here.

3. Eagles (11-5)

SITUATION: The Eagles will be the No. 3 seed unless they win and the Bears lose to Detroit.

OUTLOOK: Philly has a small chance at the No. 2 seed, but they may opt to rest up for the playoffs. Mike Garafolo has indicated that the Eagles are considering resting “some starters” in Week 18 against Commanders. This is a contest that could feature starters for less than a full game, even if they suit up.

**UPDATE** Jeff McLane is reporting that the Eagles will rest “Jalen Hurts and most starters” for Week 18

4. Panthers (8-8) and 11. Bucs (7-9)

SITUATION: Carolina plays Tampa Bay for the NFC South. The loser is eliminated.

OUTLOOK: If the Falcons beat the Saints on Sunday, this game will actually not matter. But since it is played on Saturday, both teams will be going all out for a chance to make the playoffs.

6. Rams (11-5)

SITUATION: The Rams can clinch the No. 5 seed with a win and a Niners loss. Otherwise, they will be the No. 6 seed.

OUTLOOK: The NFC West title game will already be in the books, and it should give a bit of a clearer picture here. If San Francisco wins, the Rams cannot advance their seeding and should be considered likely to rest. If Seattle wins, L.A. has a shot at the No. 5 seed, which they may play for, given the difference in matchup quality for Round 1. Sean McVay stated the starters would play after the Monday Night Football loss to Atlanta: “No, they were going to play anyway,” McVay said. “We need to play. We need to play better football. So I don’t know what the consequences are in those different types of things, but we’ve got to play better.”

It is worth noting that McVay has basically never played for seeding, and the Cardinals (their Week 18 opponent) are awful. The starters may participate in an effort to get some momentum going into the playoffs, but it would be surprising to see them play the whole game.

7. Packers (9-6-1)

SITUATION: Green Bay is locked into the No. 7 seed.

OUTLOOK: The Packers cannot advance their seeding and are an extremely banged-up team right now. We consider them likely to rest a ton of starters in Week 18.

**UPDATE** Matt LaFleur says the Packers will rest “some starters” in Week 18. Jordan Love was still in concussion protocol as of Wednesday.

The 27-year-old will become a free agent if he is unclaimed in waivers. The Cowboys finish their season Sunday at the New York Giants.

Per ESPN, a source said the decision to move on from Diggs was due, ""to a culmination of events, including performance.""

Diggs signed a five-year, $97 million contract extension in 2023 but almost immediately began having injury problems, including a blown-out knee in 2023, more knee issues last year, and a concussion this year while trying to install a television at his home.

Last offseason he rehabbed on his own, which didn't sit well with the Cowboys, who fined him, then Dallas waited three weeks to play him this year after he came off injured reserved for his concussion, as he eventually missed seven games.

Digges played eight games this year. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 2021, when he led the league in interceptions, and in 2022.

The Buffalo Bills enter the regular-season finale against the New York Jets with a mix of injured players, others playing through ailments and an added layer of uncertainty over who might be held out with the postseason in mind.

Quarterback Josh Allen continues to manage a foot injury, several veterans remain sidelined or limited, and Buffalo could choose caution over urgency with certain starters depending on how the week unfolds.

Linebacker and defensive captain Terrel Bernard has already been ruled out with a calf injury.

The Bills (11–5) host the New York Jets (3-13) at 4:25 p.m. Sunday.

NFL teams have to submit a report on practice participation on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for a Sunday game. There are three levels of practice participation that can be designated: did not participate, limited participation and full participation.

A game status report is due by 4 p.m. Friday for Sunday games.

Here is the Bills vs. Jets injury report for Week 17:

Buffalo Bills injury update for Week 18

Josh Allen, QB, foot

Josh Allen's right foot continued to be bothersome in the Bills' loss to the Eagles.

Allen had X-rays postgame, which were negative, on the foot in Week 17 and Week 18.

He originally suffered the injury while retreating and falling to the ground on a 22-yard sack against the Browns in Week 17. Allen limped off the field and was evaluated by athletic trainers as he sat on the bench late in the second quarter. He walked to the locker room with trainers just prior to halftime with his right cleat off and received X-rays, which were negative. Allen returned to for the second half and did not miss any plays.

Allen played the entirety versus the Eagles, rushing for two touchdowns in the final 5:11 of the game, but he was sacked five times. He appeared to be favoring the foot and attempted all of his passes from the pocket for the first time in his career.

Allen has started 139 consecutive games, the longest active streak by a quarterback.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said to get off the field he'll have to ""wrestle him.""

""We'll just take it one day at a time and see how he does here through the week,"" McDermott said.

Dalton Kincaid, TE, knee

Dalton Kincaid did not play against the Eagles due to a nagging knee injury. It was the fifth game he's missed this season.

He was shut out with no catches on one target and agitated the knee injury in the win over the Browns in Week 16.

Jordan Poyer, S, hamstring

Jordan Poyer missed Week 17 with a hamstring injury that occurred while recording a half-sack on Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders late in the fourth quarter. He came off the field for the Bills' final two defensive snaps of the game.

Matt Prater, K, right quadriceps

Matt Prater has been out the last two games.

The 41-year-old kicker suffered a quadriceps injury in Week 15 and did not practice leading up to Week 16 or Week 17.

Prater has made 18 of 20 field goals and 43 of 46 extra points for 97 points in 14 games. His 90% field goal percentage is tied for 12th in the NFL this season.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Monday that Prater should be available against the Jets.

In his absence, the Bills signed veteran kicker Michael Badgley to the practice squad and elevated him twice. Badgley missed an extra point in each of the two games and was released by the Bills on Monday.

Jordan Phillips, DT, ankle

Jordan Phillips has not played the last two games after suffering an ankle injury against the Patriots in Week 15.

Phillips stayed down on the field after a 9-yard run by TreVeyon Henderson in the second quarter. He was able to get to his feet and walk off under his own power. He went into the blue medical tent and the locker room for further evaluation and did not return. Phillips had a boot on his right foot in the locker room after the game.

The 11-year veteran has nine tackles and one sack in 10 games in 2025.

Terrel Bernard, LB, elbow

Terrel Bernard has already been ruled out against the Jets by Bills head coach Sean McDermott.

Bernard exited with a calf injury against the Eagles on Sunday. He was initially ruled questionable to return but was downgraded to out.

Bernard went into the blue medical tent then exited the tent and talked with athletic trainers.

Bernard was playing in his second game since returning from a three-game absence due to a dislocated elbow.

DaQuan Jones, DT, calf

DaQuan Jones did not play in Week 17 due to a calf injury. The 12-year veteran has 22 tackles, three sacks and a forced fumble in 12 games in 2025.

Spencer Brown, OT, eye

Spencer Brown briefly left in the fourth quarter after he was gouged in the eye and hit in the throat by Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter. He missed two offensive plays. Brown said he ""took a strong right hook to the eyeball"" and did not think it was accidentally.

Buffalo Bills injured reserve

Landon Jackson, DE, knee

Landon Jackson was injured on his second defensive snap against the Dolphins in Week 10.

The rookie third-round pick came off the left edge on a run by Ollie Gordon and fought off a block before falling backward. He immediately brought his right knee to his chest and grabbed it in pain and trainers evaluated him on the field.

Jackson was ruled out for the game shortly after. He returned to the Bills sideline in the second half with a brace on his right knee and using crutches.

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Jackson is out for the rest of the season.

Ed Oliver, DT, biceps

Ed Oliver suffered a torn biceps injury which required and is out indefinitely. He was placed on on injured reserve on Oct. 28 and was eligible to return in Week 13.

Oliver was hurt in the second quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.

Oliver, who had a sack on the first possession of the game, went into the medical tent and FOX cameras showed him speaking with trainers and pointing to his left arm. He returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling under his hooded sweatshirt.

He missed four games earlier this season (Weeks 2-5) with an ankle injury after he got stepped on in practice on Sept. 10.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Oliver could potentially return for the playoffs.

McDermott gave an update on Dec. 28 that Oliver suffered a minor setback in his recovery but is ""moving in a good direction.""

Taylor Rapp, S, knee

Taylor Rapp was placed on injured reserve on Oct. 24.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Rapp was battling an injury since training camp and ""it got to the point where he can't be himself.""

Rapp ha 26 tackles in six games this season.

Michael Hoecht, DE, Achilles

Michael Hoecht tore his right Achilles in the fourth quarter of the win against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.

He suffered the non-contact injury while taking one step into his rush off the left edge with 14:25 remaining. Hoecht was unable to put pressure on his right leg. He waved off the cart that drove into the field to take him to the locker room. Instead, Hoecht hobbled off with the help of trainers and stayed on the bench with his teammates for the rest of the game.

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

""It's a big loss,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. “I feel terrible for him.”

Tyler Bass, K, left hip/groin

Tyler Bass was placed on injured reserve on Friday, Sept. 5 after he was unable to practice the day prior. Bass missed most of training camp with pelvic soreness, sitting out from July 28 to Aug. 19 before returning for the preseason finale. He went 3-for-4 in that game, connecting from 37, 37 and 39 yards before pushing a 26-yarder wide right.

Bass was eligible to return in Week 5 against the New England Patriots but has not had his 21-day practice window opened.

Matt Prater, 41, signed to the Bills practice squad, was elevated for Week 1 and made a 32-yard game-winning field goal with no time left to defeat the Baltimore Ravens 41-40 in Week 1. Prater has since been signed to the active roster and is 10-for-11 on field goals and 17-for-17 on extra points through six games.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Bass underwent season-ending surgery in November.

Cameron Johnston, P, foot/ankle

Cameron Johnston suffered left foot and ankle injuries after taking a hit to his left plant leg on a punt in the fourth quarter in the Week 4 win over the Saints. The Bills placed him on injured reserve on Sept. 30 and signed punter Mitch Wishnowsky.

New Orleans linebacker Nephi Sewell crashed into Johnston’s left leg and was flagged for a roughing the kicker penalty. Johnston, 33, immediately slammed his helmet to the turf in frustration before hobbling off with trainers.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead. He walked to the X-ray room after the game.

Johnston was carted off the field with a season-ending right knee injury in Week 1 last season after taking a low shot while playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Dorian Strong, CB, neck

Dorian Strong played in four games with one start before suffering a neck injury and being placed on injured reserve on Oct. 4. The rookie sixth-round pick was eligible to return in Week 10.

Damar Hamlin, S, pectoral

Damar Hamlin suffered pectoral injury in practice Oct. 9 and was placed on injured reserve.

He was eligible to return in Week 11, although Bills coach Sean McDermott said it's ""up in the air"" if Hamlin's injury is season-ending.

Hamlin started 14 games in 2024 but has played a reserve role this year with Cole Bishop and Taylor Rapp as the starting safeties. He has one tackle in five games.

DeWayne Carter, DT, Achilles

DeWayne Carter suffered a torn Achilles and will miss the entire 2025 season.

Carter, a 2024 third-round pick, recorded 14 tackles, five tackles for loss, three quarterback hits and a pass defended in 11 games last year.

Chase Lundt, OT, knee

Chase Lundt, a rookie sixth-round pick, was placed on injured reserve on Dec. 19. Lundt has appeared in two games, with three offensive snaps and five special teams snaps, in 2025.

Wande Owens, S, undisclosed

The undrafted rookie was waived Aug. 23 with an injury designation and went unclaimed on waivers.

New York Jets injury update for Week 18

Breece Hall, RB, knee

Breece Hall suffered a knee injury when he slammed his knee into the ground out of bounds while being tackled in the fourth quarter against the Patriots on Sunday. He said after the game that he is fine and won't need testing.

Mason Taylor, TE, neck

Mason Taylor has missed the last three games with a neck injury. The rookie has 44 catches for 369 yards and one touchdown in 13 games in 2025.

Isaiah Davis, RB, concussion

Isaiah Davis was evaluated for a concussion after a kickoff in the fourth quarter against the Patriots in Week 17. He did not return to the game.

Davis has 236 rushing yards and a touchdown on 43 carries and 21 receptions for 186 yards in 16 games in 2025.

Qwan'tez Stiggers, CB, knee

Qwan'tez Stiggers was helped off he field with a knee injury in the third quarter in the loss to the Patriots last week. He was helped off the field by athletic trainers and did not return. Stiggers led the Jets with 10 tackles in the game.

Now, here's a game-by-game look at Week 18 motivation.

Saturday, January 3rd - 4:30 pm Eastern

Carolina (8-8) at Tampa Bay (7-9) (ESPN/ABC)

Early Line: Tampa Bay - 3.2, Total 44.5

Carolina Motivation: 10/10

Projected Playoff Position: NFC #4 Seed (Range: NFC #4 Seed to 13th pick)

Tampa Bay Motivation: 10/10

Projected Draft Position: #14 Overall (Range: NFC #4 Seed to 12th pick)

The Falcons' win over the Rams on Monday Night threw a dramatic wrench into the NFC South championship race. The simple scenario: a Panthers win clinches the NFC South. If the Buccaneers win, both teams will be watching the Atlanta-New Orleans game. A Buccaneers-Falcons win combination puts three teams in first with 8-9 records. The Panthers would win that tiebreaker.

Fantasy Impact: Rico Dowdle needs seven yards for a $1 million contract incentive. Bryce Young and Tetairoa McMillan are coming off disappointing performances. They were much more productive in Week 16 against Tampa Bay. Jalen Coker and Chuba Hubbard are options in deeper leagues.

Baker Mayfield had his best game since Week 5 last week. Mike Evans, Chris Godwin Jr., and Jalen McMillan are the top receiving options, as Emeka Egbuka has been quiet over the second half of the season, especially after all three other receivers returned from injury. Bucky Irving has led the backs but also failed to put up substantial fantasy numbers. Rachaad White and Sean Tucker are free agents following the 2025 season and are looking to make an impact to improve their value.

Revenge: Baker Mayfield, Teddy Bridgewater, David Moore

Saturday, January 3rd - 8:00 pm Eastern

Seattle (13-3) at San Francisco (12-4) (ESPN/ABC)

Early Line: Seattle -1.5, Total 49.5

Seattle Motivation: 10/10

Projected Playoff Position: NFC #1 Seed (Range: NFC #1 to #5 Seed)

San Francisco Motivation: 10/10

Projected Playoff Position: NFC #6 Seed (Range: NFC #1 to #6 Seed)

The winner takes the #1 seed in the NFC. The Rams' loss to Atlanta ensures the Seahawks can fall no lower than fifth. If the 49ers lose, they would need the Rams to lose to the Cardinals to avoid falling to the six seed.

Fantasy Impact: Play everyone you have in this game. Rashid Shaheed will likely be out for Seattle. There is optimism that George Kittle will be available after missing Week 17 for the 49ers. Brock Purdy, Christian McCaffrey, Jauan Jennings, and Ricky Pearsall are in play for the 49ers. Sam Darnold, Zach Charbonnet, Ken Walker III, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and A.J. Barner are the options for the Seahawks. Cooper Kupp is a desperation option.

Given the uncertainty around the Week 18 schedule, kickoff timing, and projected points, this is a game to target when players are available.

Revenge: Sam Darnold, Eric Saubert

Sunday, January 4th - 1:00 pm Eastern

Indianapolis (8-8) at Houston (11-5) (CBS)

Early Line: Houston -10.0, Total 40.5

Indianapolis Motivation: 0/10

Playoff Position: 15th Overall (Range: 14th pick to 18th pick, Current SoS: .537)

Houston Motivation: 10/10

Projected Draft Position: AFC #5 Seed (Range: AFC #3 to #7 Seed)

Houston can win the AFC South with a win and a Jacksonville loss. They cannot climb higher than the #3 seed. A loss, combined with Buffalo and LA Chargers wins, would drop them to the #7 seed.

Indianapolis traded its pick to the Jets in the Sauce Gardner move. The Colts should be motivated to play spoiler with no draft consideration attached.

Fantasy Impact: Houston's pieces are in play, with C.J. Stroud, Woody Marks, and Nico Collins the priorities. Tight end Dalton Schultz has been reliable. Rookie receivers Jayden Higgins and Jaylin Noel had big games in Week 17. Collins has incentives in play, but it would take 24 receptions and 343 yards to trigger them.

The Colts announced rookie Riley Leonard will start at quarterback over Philip Rivers. Jonathan Taylor is the headliner as he chases the NFL rushing crown. He trails James Cook by 47 yards. Cook kicks off after Taylor. Michael Pittman Jr needs 227 yards to trigger a $250,000 incentive. Pittman has a $29 million cap hit in 2026 that will likely require a restructuring or extension, or force the Colts to move on. Alec Pierce is a pending free agent who should have ample attention if he gets to the open market.

Tennessee (3-13) at Jacksonville (12-4) (CBS)

Early Line: Jacksonville -11.5, Total 47.5

Tennessee Motivation: 0/10

Playoff Position: 4th Overall (Range: 2nd pick to 7th pick, Current SoS: .574)

Jacksonville Motivation: 10/10

Projected Draft Position: AFC #3 Seed (Range: AFC #1 to #5 Seed)

Jacksonville has a wide range of outcomes, from grabbing the #1 seed with a win and a Denver and New England loss, to falling to the #5 seed with a loss and a Texans win. A win combined with either Denver or New England losing would move them to the #2 seed. The Jaguars play before Denver and New England, so they want to get to the clubhouse with the lead, then hope for chaos.

Tennessee cannot get to the 1st overall pick, but, like multiple teams, anything from the 2nd overall pick to the 7th pick is in play.

Fantasy Impact: Jacksonville is a full go offensively, and Trevor Lawrence has been red hot. Travis Etienne Jr., Jakobi Meyers, Brian Thomas Jr., Parker Washington, and Brenton Strange are all in play for fantasy and DFS purposes. Jacksonville has multiple contract incentives in play, but none are likely to be reached.

Tennessee will play all its pieces. Cameron Ward remains at quarterback, and Tony Pollard and Tyjae Spears will both be involved at running back. The team has cycled receivers, leaning on rookies Chimere Dike, Elic Ayomanor, and Gunnar Helm in different moments. Chig Okonkwo is a pending free agent. Pollard is chasing significant contract incentives, needing 66 rushing yards for $250,000, and two touchdowns would give him $200,000. Van Jefferson joins Okonkwo as a pending free agent; one reception will earn him a $100,000 incentive.

Revenge: Calvin Ridley (IR)

Green Bay (9-6-1) at Minnesota (8-8) (FOX)

Early Line: Minnesota -6.5, Total 36.5

Green Bay Motivation: 0/10

Playoff Position: NFC #7 Seed

Minnesota Motivation: 2/10

Projected Draft Position: 18th Overall (Range: 13th pick to 18th pick, Current SoS: .517)

Green Bay is the only team in the NFL that knows precisely where it will be seeded after Week 18. The Packers are locked into the 7th seed and will wait to see whether they travel to Chicago or Philadelphia. The Packers have not officially announced they will rest key starters, but they have been hammered with injuries, and it would be a surprise to see them not take advantage of the situation. The one mitigating factor is Jordan Love missing Week 17 with a concussion and the potential rust concerns, though that feels more like a media talking point than an actionable decision.

Minnesota has played spoiler down the stretch, winning four straight and eliminating the Cowboys and Lions from playoff contention.

Fantasy Impact: This is not a matchup to aggressively target in fantasy, evidenced by the 36.5 point total.

Malik Willis should receive another opportunity to build upon a strong resume for a bridge quarterback opportunity. Willis will be a free agent following the season, and Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Halfley is in the running for head coach opportunities, potentially creating a natural pairing. We should not expect to see Josh Jacobs, Christian Watson, Jayden Reed, or Romeo Doubs in a meaningful role, as all are high-value to the offense and have worked through injuries this season. It could be an opportunity for rookie Matthew Golden to have a showcase game. Dontayvion Wicks suffered a concussion against Baltimore in Week 17. The only incentive in play is John Fitzpatrick topping 35% of the offensive snaps. He is at 35.2% for the year.

The Vikings expect Max Brosmer to start again. Brosmer was better in Week 17, though the offense struggled badly. Justin Jefferson is chasing 1,000 yards. Josh Oliver has a somewhat unrealistic incentive in play, needing two touchdowns. Jordan Mason has a yardage incentive in play, though he has missed the last couple of games with a leg injury. Jailen Nailor is the only pending free agent of note.

Revenge: Aaron Jones Sr., Ben Sims

New Orleans (6-10) at Atlanta (7-9) (FOX)

Early Line: Atlanta -2.5, Total 43.5

New Orleans Motivation: 4/10

Projected Draft Position: 8th Overall (Range: 8th pick to 12th pick, Current SoS: .493)

Atlanta Motivation: 10/10

Projected Draft Position: 13th Overall (Range: 8th pick to 15th pick, Current SoS: .496)

This matchup became the most bizarre of the week after the Falcons upset the Rams on Monday Night. The Falcons can win a share of the NFC South, though they would lose the tiebreaker to the Panthers. If the Buccaneers beat the Panthers on Saturday, a Falcons win would force a three-way tie that ends with Carolina. The Falcons do not own their own 1st round pick, trading it to the Rams for James Pearce Jr. in 2025's draft. There is little reason for them not to try for a share of the division.

On the Saints' side, they have been playing spoiler for two months. They are on a 5-2 run after starting 1-8, and they have a 4-game winning streak. The Texans have the longest active streak, at 8, the Jaguars are at 7, and the Seahawks and 49ers are at 6. A win here would give the Saints a chance at the longest active streak when the 2026 season starts. Kellen Moore is working to instill a winning culture in New Orleans and will not disrupt that for a draft position.

The intensity of this rivalry is the cherry on top. These teams fall into the classic ""They do not like each other"" trope.

Fantasy Impact: Bijan Robinson has a chance to break the NFL's scrimmage yardage record, needing 254 yards. A huge lift, but it is in play. Kirk Cousins could be getting his final opportunity to show a team he can be their bridge starter. His contract includes an out, and Atlanta may feel compelled to exercise it given the $57 million at play. Kyle Pitts Sr. and Tyler Allgeier are pending free agents. The Falcons have no contract incentives in play.

The Saints hit their significant contract incentives with Juwan Johnson's big season. Most of the roster is under contract for 2026, with Taysom Hill the significant question mark. Chris Olave becomes extension eligible and would be looking to cap his best season before those negotiations. Olave can not claim the top spot in any receiving categories, though he could land inside the Top 5 for Saints seasons in all three triple crown categories of receptions, yards, and touchdowns. There is hope Devin Neal can return from the hamstring injury that has cost the last couple of weeks. Cameron Jordan could be playing his final game with the franchise; he is the Saints' all-time sack leader.

Cleveland (4-12) at Cincinnati (6-10) (CBS)

Early Line: Cincinnati -7.5, Total 44.5

Cleveland Motivation: 0/10

Projected Draft Position: 6th Overall (Range: 2nd pick to 7th pick, Current SoS: .491)

Cincinnati Motivation: 0/10

Projected Draft Position: 11th Overall (Range: 8th pick to 12th pick, Current SoS: .517)

The Browns got the chance to play spoiler to rival Pittsburgh in Week 17 and came through, but the win took them out of the running for the 1st overall pick. They can still reach 2nd, but it would take the Giants, Cardinals, Jets, and Titans to all win. Unlikely. A win drops them to 7th at the lowest, as there is a two-win gap between 7th and 8th.

The Bengals also won in Week 17, though their win over Arizona did not carry the silver lining of ruining Pittsburgh's weekend. Both teams are playing their starters as Zach Taylor announced Joe Burrow would be on the field.

Fantasy Impact: The Browns are chasing history, with Myles Garrett going for the NFL sack record. Stellar rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. is unlikely to play after leaving Week 17 with an injury. The Browns have been without David Njoku for multiple weeks; he could move into second on the team's reception list. The Browns have a void option on Njoku's deal, and he carries a massive $24 million cap hit. If active, he could be playing his final game with the franchise, given Fannin's emergence. The Browns have no other notable pending free agents.

The Bengals are also pursuing milestones. Ja'Marr Chase could break his own team record for receptions in a season, needing ten. Chase Brown could record his first 1,000-yard season, while Tee Higgins could set a career high for touchdown receptions. Samaje Perine is the only Bengal chasing obtainable contract incentives, though it would take 160 rushing yards. Joe Flacco, Noah Fant, and Tanner Hudson are pending free agents.

Revenge: Joe Flacco, Trayveon Williams

Dallas (7-8-1) at NY Giants (3-13) (FOX)

Early Line: Dallas -5.5, Total 52.5

Dallas Motivation: 0/10

Projected Draft Position: 16th Overall (Range: 11th pick to 18th pick, Current SoS: .436)

NY Giants Motivation: 0/10

Projected Draft Position: 2nd Overall (Range: 1st pick to 7th pick, Current SoS: .531)

The Giants and the Raiders are the only teams capable of getting the #1 overall pick. The boost to the Jets' SoS after adding Buffalo in Week 18 will take them out of the running, while Tennessee and Arizona's metrics are already too high. They showed in Week 17's dominant tankathon win over the Raiders that they are still trying. The team will have a new coach and was not shy in saying everyone on the roster, including Jaxson Dart, would be evaluated following the season.

Brian Schottenheimer confirmed that the Cowboys will play their starters in Week 18. The Cowboys played everyone against the Commanders in Week 17 in a similar situation. The tie against Green Bay takes tiebreakers out of the conversation; they would pick behind all the teams with seven wins or behind all the eight-win teams.

Fantasy Impact: Week 2's 40-37 shootout showed everyone is a go here for fantasy purposes.

Dak Prescott can set the franchise's all-time passing touchdowns record. He already owns the yardage record. He can also set the franchise record for single-season yardage. George Pickens is set to be a free agent, looking to hit the market on a high note. Wan'Wan'Dale Robinson is in a similar position for the Giants. Both tight end Jake Ferguson and running back Javonte Williams were removed from the Christmas Day game against Washington with injuries. Malik Davis would be the top back if Williams is out, and can be on the radar in the deepest leagues even if Williams starts. Tight end Theo Johnson missed Week 17 with an illness for the Giants; he should be good to return. Tyrone Tracy Jr. has led a 65-35 split with Devin Singletary over the second half of the season.

Pickens, Robinson, Williams, Davis, Cowboys receiver Jalen Tolbert, and Giants tight end Daniel Bellinger are all potential free agents looking to end the season on a high note. Neither team has significant contract incentives in play.

If things go even a little off the rails over the 16 games Jokić is set to miss at a minimum, they could find themselves in a nasty fight for a top-six seed.","Nikola Jokić suffered a left knee hyperextension during the Nuggets' loss at Miami on Monday. That's good news, relatively speaking. There was legitimate fear of an ACL.

The bad news is Jokić is expected to be out at least four weeks, and probably more than that as that is just the date for reevaluation. That changes quite a lot -- both for the Nuggets, who are currently sitting right on the West's 10-loss cut line for a top-four seed, and for what was shaping up to be a photo-finish MVP race.

SGA is the runaway MVP leader now

Jokić hasn't missed a single game this season, but with the Nuggets slated to play 16 games over the next 28 days, he'll finish with a maximum 66 games played. The cutoff for MVP is 65 games played. That mean Jokić would have to come back on the shortest timeline possible and not miss one game the rest of the season to be eligible for MVP. Not going to happen.

This totally clears Gilgeous-Alexander's path to a second straight MVP (-450 to win, per BetMGM), and that would change his historic standing pretty considerably. Going from one to two MVPs is a big leap. Kobe Bryant never won a second. Neither did Shaq. Kevin Durant only has one.

All told, only 15 players in NBA history have won multiple MVPs, with 10 of them having won at least their second by the time they turned 27: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Jokić, Moses Malone, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Tim Duncan and Bob Petit.

If this happens, Gilgeous-Alexander would become the 16th to win at least two and the 11th to do so by the age of 27. With two MVPs, he would jump into the class of Curry, Duncan, Antetokounmpo and Petit and Steve Nash -- with a long runway in front of him and a team built to keep him in MVP position for years to come.

Can a sleeper MVP emerge?

It's unlikely if SGA stays healthy, but it's worth mentioning the guys who are now elevated into the tier where circumstances could break their way and they have one less hurdle to jump with Jokić out. These guys would include Cade Cunningham (+4000), Jalen Brunson (+6600) and Jaylen Brown (+25000), who are leading the top three teams in the East right now and are having absolutely incredible seasons.

Tyrese Maxey (+15000) is doing the same, but the Sixers almost certainly aren't going to win enough games to give him a real chance. In the West, Kevin Durant (+100000) and Alperen Sengun (+100000) would likely split each other's vote from Houston. Victor Wembanyama (+5000) has already missed 12 games, so he'll probably end up ineligible.

Luka Doncic (+375) is the West's wild card. If the Lakers were to get red hot and take over Denver's spot in the standings as a top-three team, he could get some love if he puts up crazy numbers. Anthony Edwards (+20000) is someone to watch for the same reasons if the Wolves, currently No. 6, make a huge run.

At the very least, all these guys are now in position to get higher votes than they were before Jokić went down. But again, something unforeseen would have to happen to SGA and/or the Thunder for someone else to actually win.

Where does this leave the Nuggets?

This is the big question. Denver is currently No. 3 in the West but tied in the loss column with the No. 4 Rockets and No. 5 Lakers. As well as they've played, they're only three games above the play-in line in what is a bumper-to-bumper Western Conference race. If things go even a little off the rails over the 16 games Jokić is set to miss at a minimum, they could find themselves in a nasty fight for a top-six seed.

The good news is the Nuggets have gotten marginally better with Jokić off the court than they have been dating back to the championship season, but let's keep this in proper perspective. They still struggle in a big way without him, as any team would absent the best player in the world.

*Numbers per Cleaning the Glass

Beyond the numbers, the Nuggets are equipped with more players who can scale up their offensive output this season. Jonas Valanciunas will slide into the starting center spot. Tim Hardaway Jr. can crank up. Cam Johnson has finally gotten on track from 3. Peyton Watson can play. Aaron Gordon is due back from injury soon. Jamal Murray is having the best regular season of his career.

There's a big difference, however, in scoring the way Murray has with Jokić running the show and consuming so much attention and doing so as the No. 1 option on whom defenses will now be disproportionately focused. It doesn't bode well for the Nuggets that so far this year, when Murray has had to play without Jokić, they have been outscored by eight points per 100 possessions with what would rank as a bottom-five offense and defense, per CTG.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/30/a8ee5a1e-7e89-4f11-b6d3-cb8cc9e32079/thumbnail/1200x675/ebf503249a87f192161bb433304eb632/jokic-getty.png,N,,2025-12-31 10:00:59.248683

You just try to take care of your guys and get them as ready for that short week as much as you can.""","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The San Francisco 49ers began preparation for Saturday's showdown against the Seattle Seahawks with two of their best players -- left tackle Trent Williams and running back Christian McCaffrey -- sitting out Tuesday's practice.

Though Williams and McCaffrey don't normally participate in the first practice of the week because of veteran rest days, the pair showed up on Tuesday's participation report with actual ailments. In Williams' case, it was an injured right hamstring suffered in Sunday's win against the Chicago Bears. McCaffrey was a new addition because of what coach Kyle Shanahan described as back stiffness.

Of the two, Williams' status for the game against Seattle appears to be more tenuous. Shanahan said there isn't yet a determination on how much time Williams could miss after injuring the hamstring on the first play of last week's game. He did leave the door open for Williams to play against the Seahawks, though that will be difficult, especially on a short week.

""Not sure how long [he'll be out],"" Shanahan said. ""He's got a shot for this week.""

McCaffrey was more adamant about his status, saying the back issue is ""not serious"" in his weekly meeting with the media. Shanahan indicated McCaffrey has been fighting the back stiffness since the Dec. 14 game against the Tennessee Titans.

""I know he battled it hard that week, but I haven't heard anything about it since,"" Shanahan said. ""It might have stiffened up in the game, and it was sore from Sunday night, so that's why we've got him on here today.""

In better news for the 49ers, tight end George Kittle was a limited participant in Tuesday's practice after missing last week with a sprained left ankle. Kittle injured the ankle against the Indianapolis Colts on Dec. 22, then didn't practice last week or play against the Bears.

Kittle's participation in practice is a positive sign, but Shanahan wasn't ready to declare that Kittle will return this week just yet since the Niners didn't have anything close to a full-speed practice Tuesday.

""I wouldn't assume that [he'll play this week],"" Shanahan said. ""We're barely moving today. We have a short week, so we won't be doing much all week.""

Defensive lineman Keion White (groin) and fullback Kyle Juszczyk (hip) also did not practice because of lingering issues from the win against Chicago.

Like Kittle, receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee), cornerback Upton Stout (concussion) and defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos (knee) were limited.

Saturday's game comes with significant stakes: The winner will be the NFC's No. 1 seed, which comes with a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. Shanahan and the Niners weren't thrilled with the game landing on Saturday because it leaves them less time to rest and recover from injuries for a second straight week.

""Once you find out, you spend 10 seconds bitter about it then you say it is what it is,"" Shanahan said. ""Everyone's got to deal with it sometimes, that's just how it is. So, you get frustrated but nothing you can do after that. Then you've got to make the adjustments to make sure you're right for that day. ... You just try to take care of your guys and get them as ready for that short week as much as you can.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1229%2Fr1594587_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-31 06:58:38.235618

How would you grade the Patriots’ performance in Week 17?","The New England Patriots. took care of business against the New York Jets on Sunday, living up to their status as a 13.5-point favorites by completely dismantling their opponent. The Patriots jumped to a 42-3 lead midway through the third quarter and ended up winning 42-10 after taking their foot off the gas down the stretch.

The game did not only see several noteworthy performances on both sides of the ball, but an impressive all-around outing from the newly-crowned AFC East champions.

Patriots position grades from NFL Week 17

Quarterback: Even if we are regarding the quality of the opponent — or lack thereof — Drake Maye was outstanding. He led the Patriots to six touchdowns in his six drives, and when he was pulled after the final TD had completed 19 of 21 passes for 256 yards with five touchdowns to five different receivers. He also posted 1.24 expected points added per play, the highest such mark in the NFL this season for a quarterback. The new MVP frontrunner was spectacular, and even his backup fared well: Joshua Dobbs went 3-for-4 for 30 yards in his one-and-a-half quarters of work. | Grade: A

Running back: The first game between the Patriots and Jets in Week 11 was the TreVeyon Henderson show. On Sunday, Rhamondre Stevenson had his day in the sun: the veteran, who missed that November meeting with a toe injury, finished with 102 scrimmage yards and a pair of touchdowns on 14 touches. Henderson also remained actively involved, though, and led the team with 82 rushing yards. Even backup D’Ernest Johnson contributed 5 yards to what was a 156-yard outing on the ground for New England. | Grade: A

Wide receiver: Down starters Kayshon Boutte and Mack Hollins, the Patriots turned to rookies Kyle Williams and Efton Chism to take on a bigger workload. The pair delivered, catching a combined five passes for 50 yards and a Chism touchdown. The star of the show at wide receiver, however, was Stefon Diggs: the veteran caught all six of his targets for 101 yards and a score. The least prominently-featured of the bunch was DeMario Douglas, who played just nine snaps after carrying the questionable label into the game; he finished with one 10-yard reception. | Grade: A

Tight end: Facing some turnover at wide receiver, the Patriots decided to get both of their top tight ends actively involved in the passing game. They, too, rose. up to the occasion: Hunter Henry caught three passes for 49 yards and a touchdown, while Austin Hooper finished with two receptions for 11 yards and a score. The pair also looked good in the blocking department, with Henry in particular standing out. Fullback/tight end hybrid Jack Westover, on the other hand, was more hit-and-miss before exiting the game with an ankle injury in the early fourth quarter. | Grade: A-

Offensive line: Even with left guard Jared Wilson out, the Patriots offensive line did not skip a beat against the Jets. The Patriots’ quarterbacks were hit just four times all game — including a roughing the passer penalty drawn by Drake Maye — while the running backs found big holes for much of the afternoon. That said, the running game was a bit streaky even before the team decided to mix up its personnel with the game already decided. | Grade: B+

Defensive line: Entering the game with sack leader Harold Landry sidelined because of a knee injury and with neither Milton Williams nor Khyiris Tonga available along the interior, the Patriots took down Jets quarterback Brady Cook only once. It did not matter, because they were still disruptive enough to make Cook’s like uncomfortable. They also held firm on the ground, despite giving up 164 yards on 28 carries: most of that production came when the game was already way out of hand. | Grade: A-

Linebacker: No Robert Spillane, no problem. While the rushing total mentioned above could have been a problem it really did not change the nature of the game: the Jets had only 50 yards on the ground at intermission, in large part because of the Jack Gibbens-led linebacker group making good reads at the second level and coming downhill quickly and decisively. | Grade: A

Cornerback: The Jets did some stat-padding in the second half and had a few positive plays against New England’s backups, but the first half was a no-contest — in large part because of a cornerback group shutting down the opposing wide receivers. Led by Pro Bowler Christian Gonzalez, the Patriots dominated in man-to-man situations and allowed Brady Cook to complete only a third of his attempts against man coverage. New York’s most dangerous receiver, Adonai Mitchell, was held to 22 yards on nine targets and three receptions. | Grade: A

Safety: Brady Cook entered Week 17 with a turnover-per-dropback rate of 5.8%, and it did not take him long to add to his tally. On just his third pass attempt of the day, he threw deep down the sideline only for Jaylinn Hawkins to come over for an easy interception. Hawkins and fellow starting safety Craig Woodson did not allow any deep passes and were actively involved in the blitz-heavy run plan. Both missed a tackle attempt, while backup run support was a bit too aggressive on Breece Hall’s long touchdown in the fourth quarter, but overall the performance was solid. | Grade: B+

Special teams: The Patriots’ return and coverage units played a solid game against what is a very competitive Jets unit, while both punter Bryce Baringer and kicker Andy Borregales positively contributed as well. That said, the latter missed his lone field goal attempt in the third quarter, hitting the right upright from 41 yards out, while New York was able to convert the firsts of its two fake punts in the same period. | Grade: B

All in all, the Patriots were the better team in virtually every area on Sunday. The grades above show it, and so does the lopsided final score: outside of a few minor hiccups here and there, they played a pretty flawless game.

McCaffrey has a stiff back, Shanahan said, adding that the 29-year-old “battled it bad” against the Tennessee Titans in Week 15 and then was sore after Sunday night’s game against the Chicago Bears.

“It might have stiffened up in the game (against the Bears),” Shanahan said.

McCaffrey, who has regularly missed the first practice session each week this season, said the injury is “nothing serious.”

Williams tweaked his hamstring on the first play against the Bears while trying to make a tackle after an interception and didn’t return. Williams, 37, told Shanahan after the game that he had never pulled a hamstring before in his 15-year career. The coach said Tuesday he wasn’t sure how long Williams would be out, adding that the veteran will “give it a shot this week.”

Kittle missed the game against the Bears with a sprained ankle he suffered in Week 16 against the Indianapolis Colts. He will be limited in Tuesday’s practice, and Shanahan cautioned that Kittle’s participation does not necessarily put him on track to play against Seattle, as San Francisco’s practices will be light.

“I wouldn’t say that (Kittle has a good chance),” the coach said. “We’re barely moving today. It’s walk-through. With the short week we got, we won’t be doing much all week.”

The winner of the matchup between the 13-3 Seahawks and the 12-4 49ers will claim the No. 1 seed in the NFC, a first-round bye and home-field advantage. The Niners could fall as far as the No. 6 seed with a loss.

The listed injuries to his throwing shoulder and knee on Tuesday were new. Mayfield was listed as a limited participant on an estimated practice report as the Buccaneers conducted a walk-through.

Further details including the nature of the injuries or when Mayfield sustained them were not clear. The Bucs didn't initially provide more information about the injuries other than listing him as limited at practice.

How will injury impact Saturday's Panthers-Bucs game?

There's no indication the injuries threaten Mayfield's status for Saturday's game against the Panthers. But they're cause for further concern around a Bucs team that's floundered in the second half of the season and enters Week 18 having lost seven of its last eight games to surrender control of the NFC South.

Mayfield's play has suffered alongside that of his team. Mayfield posted four games with a quarterback rating higher than 100 as the Bucs got off to a 6-3 start. He's not eclipsed that number since Week 10 and has four games in that time frame with a rating below 80.

Now he's dealing with new injuries ahead of Tampa Bay's biggest game of the season. The Panthers would clinch the NFC South and the division's only playoff berth with a win by securing the best record at 9-8.

Both teams will release another injury report Wednesday before they have to make their game status designations on Thursday for Saturday night’s winner-take-all NFC West showdown in Santa Clara, Calif.

Seahawks injury report

Left tackle Charles Cross (hamstring) and veteran swing tackle Josh Jones (ankle, knee) were listed as non-participants on Tuesday’s practice report, while safety Coby Bryant (knee) and wide receiver/kick returner Rashid Shaheed (concussion) were listed as limited participants.

The Seahawks held a walkthrough practice, so their report was an estimation of what players would have done in a full practice.

Cross, who has missed the past two games, has yet to practice since getting injured in the final minute of Seattle’s Week 15 win over the Indianapolis Colts. Jones, who has started at left tackle in place of Cross for the past two games, is a new addition to the injury report.

Bryant’s limited designation is a positive step. He didn’t practice last week and missed Sunday’s win over the Carolina Panthers after getting injured in Seattle’s Week 16 overtime win over the Los Angeles Rams.

Shaheed is in the NFL’s concussion protocol after sustaining a concussion in Sunday’s game.

Did not participate

• LT Charles Cross (hamstring)

• OT Josh Jones (ankle, knee)

Limited participation

• S Coby Bryant (knee)

• WR Rashid Shaheed (concussion)

Full participation

• TE AJ Barner (elbow, hip)

• RT Abraham Lucas (neck)

• S Ty Okada (oblique, knee)

49ers injury report

Star running back Christian McCaffrey (back) and 12-time Pro Bowl left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) were both listed as non-participants on San Francisco’s practice report.

Williams suffered a hamstring injury in the 49ers’ win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday night, while McCaffrey is dealing with back stiffness, according to San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan.

Fullback Kyle Juszczyk (hip) and defensive end Keion White (groin) also sat out Tuesday’s practice.

Meanwhile, seven-time Pro Bowl tight end George Kittle (ankle) returned to practice as a limited participant. He missed Sunday’s game against the Bears after getting injured in the 49ers’ Week 16 win over the Indianapolis Colts.

Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle), defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos (knee) and cornerback Upton Stout (concussion) also were limited participants.

Rice picked up a knee injury in Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion after starting the game at right-back.
“That swelling (on his knee) has to come right down for him to have the chance to function.
“Big Gabi comes back from injury after six weeks, which probably should have been a bit longer,” he said in his post-match press conference.
“And he impacts the game in an incredible way, both defending and in the opposition box.”","Mikel Arteta has revealed that Declan Rice is “improving” and could be in contention to make his return for Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Bournemouth.

Rice picked up a knee injury in Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion after starting the game at right-back. He was able to play on and finish the game, and was hopeful of being fit to play a part in Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Aston Villa but was left out of the squad entirely for the 4-1 victory at Emirates Stadium.

The injury is not thought to be too serious, and when asked if the England international had a chance of coming back into the Arsenal squad for their trip to the Vitality Stadium on January 3 Arteta responded: “It depends.

“That swelling (on his knee) has to come right down for him to have the chance to function. He wasn’t available to do that today yet. He’s improving. Let’s see where he is in the next couple of days.”

While there are concerns over Rice, there was at least some positive news for Arteta who was able to welcome Kai Havertz and Ben White to the squad back for the Villa game.

Gabriel also returned to the starting XI after a lengthy spell out with a thigh injury to nod home the opening goal of the match, prompting praise from Arteta.

“Big Gabi comes back from injury after six weeks, which probably should have been a bit longer,” he said in his post-match press conference. “He comes against the team that is probably hardest to control — especially the front players and the striker that they have in terms of their movement.

“And he impacts the game in an incredible way, both defending and in the opposition box.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/30180537/GettyImages-2252877314-scaled-e1767136085494.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-30 23:59:22.044839

Detroit entered the game with only eight giveaways as an offense all season, which was the fewest in the NFL.
That's why this season hasn't buried my belief in O'Connell, and I am still willing to envision a scenario where J.J. McCarthy starts putting it together next year.
The Vikings are 8-8 despite a team passer rating of 74.3, which ranks 31st in the NFL.
The question will be how to get that upgrade at QB, whether it's from J.J. McCarthy or elsewhere.","Smith – who will turn 37 in just under five weeks – delivered another vintage performance in Purple (or in this case, Winter Whiteout) against the Detroit Lions on Christmas Day at U.S. Bank Stadium. The Vikings safety nabbed his 39th career interception to go along with a sack (No. 21.5 of his 14-year career), a pair of tackles for a loss and a trio of passes defensed. He also made his 202nd career regular-season start, moving ""The Hitman"" past Pro Football Hall of Famer and Vikings Ring of Honor member Carl Eller for third in franchise history.

With their savvy defensive veteran leading the way, the Vikings (8-8) dominated Detroit (8-8), forcing six takeaways and sacking Lions quarterback Jared Goff five times in a 23-10 rout. Detroit entered the game with only eight giveaways as an offense all season, which was the fewest in the NFL. According to Next Gen Stats, the Vikings also held the Lions to a season-low offensive success rate of 29.7 percent. Detroit's previous low in the category was 33.9 percent, which also came against Minnesota in Week 9.

Thursday was the 34th time in franchise history Minnesota has recorded at least six takeaways in a game and its first since Week 15 of the 2019 season (the Vikings forced seven turnovers at the Chargers in a 39-10 victory). Of those 34 instances, seven have come against the Lions, which is the most against any opponent. Minnesota is 25-7-2 all time when tallying six or more takeaways in a game and has won 21 consecutive games when doing so going back to the 1973 NFC Championship Game at Dallas.

The game also marked just the second time ever the Vikings have won the turnover battle 6-0 or better. The only other occurrence was in Week 8 of the 1975 season when Minnesota forced eight Atlanta turnovers and didn't turn the ball over in a 38-0 shutout victory.

Additionally, the win gave Minnesota its first season sweep of Detroit since 2020. Last year, the Vikings swept Green Bay in the regular season for the first time since 2017; coincidentally, Minnesota not only accomplished both feats in Week 17 home victories, it also occurred in the 50th regular-season game for Head Coach Kevin O'Connell (last year) and Defensive Coordinator Brian Flores (Thursday) in their coaching roles with the Vikings.

I know Kevin O'Connell can coach. He has logged 13- and 14-win seasons, somehow kept his 2023 team competitive with a mishmash of quarterbacks and essentially has done the same in 2025 with significant shortcomings at the game's most important position. Winning a divisional bout with 3 net passing yards is something I'd brag about at parties. At 8-8, the Vikings can finish a trying season with a winning record by beating Green Bay at home – and the Packers are locked into the No. 7 seed, meaning they'll likely rest players on Sunday. That's why this season hasn't buried my belief in O'Connell, and I am still willing to envision a scenario where J.J. McCarthy starts putting it together next year. We'll see if another team tries to poach Brian Flores for a head-coaching opening, and Harrison Smith could retire, but I suspect this is still a team that can compete in 2026.

WR Justin Jefferson's 59.2 receiving yards per game are, by far, the fewest of his career − through no fault of his own. But hit that average in Week 18, and he'd join Mike Evans and Randy Moss as the only players to top 1,000 in each of his first six seasons.

Minnesota has won four in a row, restoring the can't-miss-kid status to Kevin O'Connell that had started to wane after a 4-8 start that saw the Vikings eliminated from the playoffs. Still, O'Connell has ultimately tied his fate to that of quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who missed Thursday's game with a hand injury and has only started nine games in two years. The results have been mixed (5-4 with an EPA that ranks 52nd among quarterbacks with more than 100 pass attempts in the last two years).

Last season, the Colts won eight games despite a team passer rating of 75.8, which was 31st in the NFL. They got better quarterback play in 2025 and were 7-1 before a losing streak and injuries derailed them. The Vikings are 8-8 despite a team passer rating of 74.3, which ranks 31st in the NFL. The Vikings are clearly good enough to be a playoff team in 2026 with decent quarterback play. The question will be how to get that upgrade at QB, whether it's from J.J. McCarthy or elsewhere.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/ituebbn5gog8lzndxquw,N,,2025-12-31 01:57:57.019786
