The Rams concluded a long week of prep with multiple starters still in flux: Davante Adams (hamstring) is listed as doubtful after missing last week; right guard Kevin Dotson (ankle) has been ruled out; and defensive back Josh Wallace is out, while Alaric Jackson and Braden Fiske are questionable. Sean McVay also indicated that Roger McCreary could be activated off IR to help in the slot.

Meanwhile, the Falcons enter with a sizable injury list but received encouraging updates on Drake London (knee), with head coach Raheem Morris saying he feels “great” about London’s chances to play.

The final inactives, posted about 90 minutes before kickoff, will determine alignments across the offensive line, perimeter targets, and sub-packages. Tonight’s winner will likely rely on early-down efficiency, ball security, and field position in a controlled dome environment.

The Rams will lean on Matthew Stafford, Kyren Williams, and Puka Nacua to sustain drives behind a reshuffled offensive line with Kevin Dotson out and Alaric Jackson questionable.

With Davante Adams unlikely to play, expect increased usage for Tutu Atwell and tight end Colby Parkinson, with formation variety to protect the right side and maintain timing routes. Defensively, the Rams’ interior, Kobie Turner, and the edge group must compress lanes against Bijan Robinson while keeping Kirk Cousins in structure.

Atlanta’s outlook improves materially if Drake London plays; his presence enhances spacing for Kyle Pitts and opens quick-game rhythm for Cousins. With multiple Falcons corners out (Mike Hughes, Clark Phillips), the Falcons’ secondary depth will be tested, placing a premium on pass rush and tackling at the catch point.

Micah Parsons injury update

Parsons had surgery 15 days after going down with a torn ACL in the Packers' Week 15 game at the Denver Broncos.

He sustained the noncontact injury while running after Broncos quarterback Bo Nix late in the third quarter, ending his first season with the Packers in crushing fashion.

Parsons waited to have surgery following the birth of his third child in the Dallas area.

A player is typically out with an ACL injury between nine and 12 months. Parsons has implied on social media that his goal is to return by the start of next season in September and defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley predicted the All-Pro player will come back better than ever and break the NFL sack record in 2026.

Parsons understands the long road ahead.

On Christmas, Parsons said he had ""accepted the pain and the reality of this journey.""

""Some days are heavy, some days aren't but every day brings its own fight,"" he added. ""My courage, my strength, and my mind have all been tested. Still, I won't stop. I won't quit until I'm back. I'm grateful God chose me.""

As the playoffs loom, the Packers (9-6-1) are hurting without Parsons. Green Bay hasn't won a game since Parsons' injury and their defense was just smacked around and steamrolled by Derrick Henry and the Baltimore Ravens in a 41-24 loss on Dec. 27.

Micah Parsons reflects on first sack as a Packer

Before his surgery on Dec. 29, Parsons was reminiscing about his electric start as a Packer.

Parsons was on a snap count after he missed training camp with a back injury, but he made his presence felt late in a Week 1 win against the Detroit Lions at Lambeau Field when he chased down Jared Goff for his first sack wearing a Packers uniform.

Matthew Stafford’s Rams no longer have an NFC West title or a No. 1 seed to chase, and they've already locked in a wild-card spot. But Monday's game will be the final chance for a 17-year quarterback to make a statement on national TV in an attempt to win his first MVP award.

Stafford leads the NFL with 40 touchdown passes and has thrown just five interceptions to lead the Rams to an 11-4 record. New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye is hot on his tail in this race. Stafford will have to play without the NFL's leader in touchdown catches, Davante Adams, as well as his left tackle, Alaric Jackson. If Stafford can put up a big performance on primetime despite that, it could become the final statement in this tight race.

Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is second in the league in receiving yards (1,592) and third in catches (114), and Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich said his full value to Los Angeles doesn’t show even in those impressive numbers.

“He’s such an energy giver to them,” Ulbrich said. “You can see the collective energy he brings. When he makes a play, every single offensive player acknowledges him and he acknowledges them.”

Ulbrich compared Nacua to Arizona’s Trey McBride in that regard. McBride leads the league with 119 catches but had only three for 27 yards last week against the Falcons. Stopping Nacua will be a much tougher task, though. While Atlanta safeties Jessie Bates and Xavier Watts could handle McBride, the Falcons’ cornerbacks will have to take the lion’s share of the job against Nacua, and that’s unlikely to turn out as well for Atlanta.

What I’ll be watching when the Falcons host the Rams tonight:

Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford will be making just his third professional start in Atlanta tonight. Stafford, the top pick in the 2009 draft, played collegiately at Georgia. His last appearance against the Falcons in Atlanta came in 2020 when he was with the Lions.

Stafford, who is 3-3 all-time against Atlanta, has a history with the Falcons’ coaching staff as both head coach Raheem Morris and offensive coordinator Zac Robinson were with Los Angeles before going to Atlanta.

What Morris and Robinson know about Stafford does not make them eager to face him.

“He’s playing at a completely different level than anybody in the league,” Robinson said. “He’s arguably the most natural and talented thrower in the history of the game. He’s unbelievable in every aspect in life. Can’t say how much I learned from him as a coach.”

Stafford enters the game in the MVP race. He leads the NFL with 40 touchdown passes (along with just five interceptions) and is fourth in EPA per dropback (.20). Morris refers to the quarterback as “Weapon X.”

“You are left in awe a lot,” Morris said.

Stafford has eight touchdowns and four interceptions in his career against the Falcons.

Falcons rookie edge rusher James Pearce Jr. will be in the spotlight tonight. Atlanta drafted Pearce with the 26th pick, which it acquired from the Rams in a trade that included the Falcons’ 2026 first-round pick. Atlanta believed at the time that this season would go much differently than it has and that 2026 pick would be in the 20s. However, Atlanta would be picking 12th if the season ended right now, and the Rams can improve the deal even more by beating the Falcons tonight.

“I think (the media) are the only guys that care about that,” Falcons head coach Raheem Morris said of tonight’s impact on the trade. “We gave up our first round pick, went and got James Pearce who we felt like would be a first-round pick for us this year. I like James a lot.”

Pearce leads Atlanta with 8.5 sacks and has had at least half a sack in seven straight games. He is the third-betting favorite for defensive rookie of the year and could become a serious contender for the award with a big game tonight in primetime.

Pearce has helped the Falcons completely revamp their pass rush, which has been the league’s worst for the past 20 years. Atlanta is third in the league in sacks this year with 50. Five more would tie the franchise record of 55 set in 1997.

The Falcons are stuck right in the middle of mediocrity. They are going to miss the playoffs for the eighth straight season (their last trip coming in 2017). They went 8-9 last season, and that is the best they can do this season, sitting at 6-9 with two games left.

Before that, the Falcons had three straight 7-10 seasons. So what will this offseason bring? It seems like team needs big changes in the coaching staff and the front office if it’s going to get back to the playoffs any time soon.

Does owner Arthur Blank have that in him to make those changes? That’s going to be the storyline of the Falcons’ offseason.

Here are the Los Angeles Rams’ inactive players against the Atlanta Falcons: WR Davante Adams, OT Alaric Jackson, OG Kevin Dotson, CB Josh Wallace, CB Darious Williams and RB Jarquez Hunter with Stetson Bennett as the emergency quarterback.

Adams was listed as doubtful for a second straight week with a hamstring injury, so it’s no surprise the NFL’s leader in touchdown receptions is out with the Rams out of contention for the NFC West and No. 1 seed.

But Jackson’s absence will be his first of the season. He is dealing with a knee injury. It’s a significant loss against a Falcons team that ranks third in the league with 50 sacks. Falcons defensive end James Pearce, whom Atlanta selected in the first round this spring through a trade with the Rams, will be a difficult matchup.

Los Angeles also made Williams a healthy scratch, pulling the veteran cornerback out of the rotation he’d been playing in on the outside with Cobie Durant and Emmanuel Forbes Jr.

This game will mark the return of Roger McCreary from injured reserve. With Wallace out, McCreary figures to get his first real action in the slot for the Rams since their midseason trade to get him from the Tennessee Titans.

Los Angeles Rams star receiver Puka Nacua ran a deep post route from the slot into free grass in zone coverage, hopped to catch a pass from Matthew Stafford and raced 41 yards to the end zone.

It should have been the finishing touch on a monstrous performance and the game-winning touchdown in overtime in a battle for the NFC’s No. 1 seed. But the Seattle Seahawks came back, scored and went for two and the win. And then he sent a tweet.

The questions began from there, both to coach Sean McVay and within the Rams’ organization after a game and a week from Nacua that packed so many highs and lows into one. A fantastic player remains completely unpredictable from snap to snap, stream to stream and tweet to tweet.

It leaves a question that many are left to ponder: Who exactly is Puka Nacua?

As the Atlanta Falcons settle into their spot on the Mercedes-Benz Stadium sideline before Monday night’s matchup against the Los Angeles Rams, Raheem Morris is hoping owner Arthur Blank will like what he sees enough to be patient.

In his second year as the Falcons’ head coach, Morris has been transparent about his desire to copy-and-paste much of the Rams’ system on the East Coast. But he enters the penultimate game of the season uncertain if he’ll be retained for a third year.

“We have definitely mimicked a lot of things that they do and want to continue to do that,” Morris said this week. “It’s done the right way, and being a part of it is a lot of fun.”

Matt Ryan is the greatest Atlanta Falcons player, but what could he do to help the team’s front office? We may get a chance to find out.

Our Dianna Russini and Josh Kendall had a story yesterday about the team being in discussions with its former quarterback to join the front office. With the Falcons being mediocre for so long, you have to wonder: Could it hurt?

Four years after being selected with the fourth pick in the 2021 NFL Draft, Kyle Pitts Sr. is beginning to produce in a manner that matches the potential his selection came with.

During his past four games, Pitts is averaging 98.8 receiving yards per game with four touchdowns, three of which came in Week 15 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He has shown a rapport with Kirk Cousins, which was on display last week as he caught seven passes for 57 yards and a score.

This season, Pitts has 80 receptions for 854 yards with five scores.

Still early in his NFL career, Bijan Robinson already has proven to be one of the most complete, dynamic running backs in the NFL. This versatility was on full display against the Cardinals last week.

He got 16 carries for 76 yards, averaging 4.8 yards per attempt, and added seven catches for 92 yards with a touchdown. The week prior, he caught eight passes for 82 yards against Tampa Bay and rushed for another 93 yards with a touchdown.

Robinson is on pace to comfortably clear 2,000 scrimmage yards this season.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/tv63HgvSdw1d_ym1KJgvJWBO0_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-29 19:57:52.256833

London was officially listed as ""questionable"" for the Falcons' ""Monday Night Football"" matchup against the Los Angeles Rams. Atlanta has already been eliminated from postseason contention and is merely looking to play spoiler down the stretch, which led many to wonder whether the Falcons would actually allow London to suit up for the game.

Will London play in Week 17? Here are the latest updates on his status.

Is Drake London playing today?

London is active for Atlanta tonight and is expected to play. He was officially listed as ""questionable"" on the team's official injury report after being limited at each of Atlanta's practice sessions because of a knee injury but he was not listed among the inactives released 90 minutes before kickoff.

Drake London injury update

London is dealing with a lingering knee injury that kept him out of the Falcons' lineup for four games. He was able to return in Week 16 but recorded a season-low 27 yards on three catches in Atlanta's 26-19 win over the Arizona Cardinals.

London had been listed as ""questionable"" ahead of his Week 16 return and earned the same designation in Week 17 after being ""limited"" at each of Atlanta's practices ahead of the game.

That said, London's entirely limited participation was actually an upgrade over his Week 16 status. Before that game, the 24-year-old wide-out was limited at the team's first two practices of the week before being a non-participant in the team's final session.

Perhaps that's why Falcons coach Raheem Morris said he felt ""great"" about London's chances of playing against the Rams despite his questionable designation.

Falcons WR depth chart

London is one of seven wide receivers on the Falcons' 53-man roster. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

Drake London

Darnell Mooney

David Sills V

Casey Washington

Dylan Drummond

Deven Thompkins

Malik Heath

If London can't play, Mooney and Sills would rack up most of the snaps at wide receiver while running back Bijan Robinson and tight end Kyle Pitts would see an increase in targets.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/29/USAT/87950953007-usatsi-26857155.jpg?crop=5261,2961,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-29 19:57:56.303856

But the biggest concern after the defeat was the health of rookie wide receiver Luther Burden III, who was one of the stars of the shootout.

According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Burden suffered a quad injury that isn't thought to be serious. He'll undergo additional testing today.

Burden suffered his quad injury on the final play of the game, where quarterback Caleb Williams was attempting a touchdown pass on fourth-and-2 with the game on the line. Burden tried to walk off the field but fell to the ground. After attempting to walk off the field with trainers, Burden was carted to the locker room. According to ESPN's Courtney Cronin, Burden was seen grabbing his left hamstring making his way in for an X-ray after the game at Levi's Stadium.

With Burden avoiding a serious injury, the expectation is the Bears will rest him for their regular-season finale against the Detroit Lions with the hopes of him returning in the wild-card round of the playoffs. The belief is top wideout Rome Odunze, who's missed the last few games due to a foot injury, will also be ready in time for the postseason.","https://bearswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/29/SBRS/87942006007-27896950.jpg?crop=8103,4558,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-29 21:13:35.300575

Doing whatever it takes to win includes Schwesinger playing through injury and not missing a defensive snap.
Beating the Bengals would also result in the Browns splitting the season series with the Steelers and Cincinnati, capping off the season with momentum.","With the Browns going into halftime up 10-6 against the Steelers, Cleveland needed to maintain the same fight it had in the first half to finish off its division rivals.

The Browns shut out the Steelers for the next 30 minutes of playing time, including stopping Pittsburgh on three consecutive plays to the end zone to win 13-6 in Week 17 at Huntington Bank Field. Now the Browns look to ride the momentum they created against Pittsburgh into Week 18 and their final game of the season against the Bengals.

""Really proud of those guys in that football game to be in that fight for 60 minutes and come out on top,"" head coach Kevin Stefanski said. ""Some really great efforts in that game. Some guys stepping up into roles that they haven't played in previously, which I was really proud of those guys as well. So, need to build off of it. Wanted to split that series with the Steelers last week. We have an opportunity to split a series with the Bengals this week, so that'll be our sole focus.""

Here are the main pieces of news heading into the Browns' final game of the 2025 season.

Updating the injury report

TE Harold Fannin Jr., RG Wyatt Teller and LB Carson Schwesinger all dealt with injuries over the course of the game against Pittsburgh. Stefanski said that all three players are rehabbing and progressing, not ruling any of them out yet for Week 18.

Fannin left the game in the first quarter with a groin injury, an injury he first sustained during practice on Dec. 26. The injury occurred on his second catch of the game, a 28-yard touchdown reception from QB Shedeur Sanders. Fannin went to the sidelines after the score and didn't return to the game.

Teller reaggravated a calf injury that forced him to miss Week 14, 15 and 16 on the Browns' first drive of the game. G Teven Jenkins took over Teller's duties at the position, playing until the third quarter when he was ruled out after entering the concussion protocol. G Zak Zinter played the remainder of the game at guard.

Schwesinger played 100 percent of the defensive snaps against the Steelers, navigating through an injury. As a result of his determination to not come off the field, Stefanski gave Schwesinger a game ball following Cleveland's win. Schwesinger finished the game with nine combined tackles.

""I watched it during the game and making plays and pushing himself and trying to get loose in between series and that type of thing,"" Stefanski said. ""It's emblematic of the effort out there and I appreciate that and I think it speaks well about him. It speaks to his teammates as well.""

Browns highlight the impact of the 2025 rookie class

The Browns 2025 draft class features seven players who are playing key roles for Cleveland this season.

RB Quinshon Judkins, DT Mason Graham, RB Dylan Sampson, Schwesinger, and Fannin have all played in 14 or more games. Judkins leads all rookies with 59.1 rushing yards per game while Fannin has recorded 72 receptions, the most among rookies in the NFL. Schwesinger leads all rookies with 146 combined tackles, also tied for the seventh among all players in the NFL.

QB Dillon Gabriel and Sanders have each started six games this season. Gabriel has appeared in 10 total games this season, throwing for 937 passing yards with seven passing touchdowns and 86 rushing yards. Sanders made his first regular season appearance when he started the second half of Week 11 against the Ravens after Gabriel entered the concussion protocol. Sanders has started in every game since Week 11, passing for 1,289 yards for seven passing touchdowns while also being a ground threat with 143 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.

""This is – forget how good of players they are – this is as diligent of a group of workers that I've ever been around,"" Stefanski said. ""I think that's a testament to these players. I think it's a testament to (Executive President of Football Operations and General Manager) Andrew (Berry) and crew identifying these players. I think it's a testament to their coaches and how they develop them. But, at the core of it, this is a group that loves to work, loves to compete, loves to be out there with their teammates, and is willing to do anything that they have to do anything that the team needs them to do in order to win.""

Doing whatever it takes to win includes Schwesinger playing through injury and not missing a defensive snap. That mentality also includes Sampson returning after missing two games due to a hand injury and leading the Browns in rushing yards and carries against the Steelers. Sampson and rookie RB Raheim Sanders helped fill the absence of Judkins, who is out for the season due to a dislocated ankle and fractured fibula he sustained in Week 16.

""We took measures to kind of go out there and protect it, but everything went well and came out of the game feeling healthy,"" Sampson said. ""I never take playing this game for granted so anytime just going out there, being able to just play this game and then getting a win against a division team like that, that's the way you want to end it regardless of how the season has been.""

Cleveland aiming to finish strong in Week 18

After spoiling the Steelers' chances to clinch the division in Week 17 in Cleveland, the Browns aim to finish the season with the same juice in Week 18 in Cincinnati.

The regular season finale is another chance for Cleveland to build momentum and reinforce the identity they have worked to establish this season. The Browns are looking to close the year by setting the tone for the offseason and next season.

""We're not going out there on that field to go and lose, like we're trying to win every game,"" Sampson said. ""At the end of the day, it just boils down to individually, what do each of us care about, why we started to play this game in the first place. So, you can look at the circumstances and they're not that favorable, but we signed up to play this game and to give our all for it, so I think that's what we did yesterday and that's what we're going to continue to do.""

A win against the Bengals would close out the season with two consecutive wins. Beating the Bengals would also result in the Browns splitting the season series with the Steelers and Cincinnati, capping off the season with momentum.

""I think it sets the tone going into the offseason for us and it kind of develops the mindset that we want to have and when you're going to be a team that's playing meaningful games in December, these are games that you're going to have to win,"" Schwesinger said. ""So, taking these seriously and approaching these games how we are I think is important and it prepares us well for the future.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/browns/hacetf6cwzhsubpt6og0,N,,2025-12-29 19:58:06.029614

The Pittsburgh Steelers' surprising loss to the Cleveland Browns opened the AFC North race and set up a winner-take-all finale against the Ravens in Week 18, while the Philadelphia Eagles edged the Buffalo Bills 13-12 in a defensive battle that came down to a last-second two-point attempt.

The action concluded with ""Sunday Night Football"" showcasing a high-scoring battle between the San Francisco 49ers and Chicago Bears. San Francisco prevailed 42-38 in a shootout at Levi’s Stadium, led by Brock Purdy’s 303 passing yards and five total touchdowns, while Bears quarterback Caleb Williams threw for 330 yards and two touchdowns in a losing effort.

The win positioned the 49ers for a winner-take-all Week 18 finale against the Seattle Seahawks, with the NFC West title, the conference’s No. 1 seed and a first-round bye all on the line.

Social Media Erupts Over NFL Week 18 Schedule

Following Sunday’s slate, the NFL released its Week 18 schedule, which immediately drew scrutiny. The league announced a Saturday doubleheader featuring the Carolina Panthers vs Tampa Bay Buccaneers at 4:30 p.m. ET and Seahawks-49ers at 8 p.m. ET, followed by a Sunday schedule that culminates with Ravens-Steelers on ""SNF.""

That decision sparked swift backlash from fans, many of whom believed Seahawks-49ers, a division rivalry with top-seed implications, was the most compelling game on the board. Social media reactions poured in, criticizing the league for passing over a matchup that would determine the NFC West champion and the conference’s top seed.

“THE SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL GAME LMOOOOO 🤡,” one fan wrote.

“How’d yall [expletive] up the most obvious Sunday Night Football decision ever?” another fan questioned.

“Ok seriously how are the Niners/Seahawks not on Sunday night football?? 8-8 vs 9-7 gets Sunday night football instead of the battle for the 1seed. Whack,” said one fan.

“We all predicted this would happen between the Steelers and Ravens you’re not slick nfl,” another fan posted.

“Hawks 49ers not being the Sunday night game is criminal,” a fan noted.

“The NFL really watched this 49ers game and they decided to have Ravens-Steelers be the last game of the regular season instead of Seahawks-49ers LMAO,” another fan remarked.

By contrast, the league chose to place Steelers-Ravens in the ""Sunday Night Football"" slot. That game will decide the AFC North title. Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson could return from a back injury that sidelined him in Week 17, and one of the league’s greatest quarterbacks, Aaron Rodgers, could play his final NFL game on Sunday should Pittsburgh lose.

Las Vegas (2-14) now has an 80 percent chance of landing the top pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, according to ESPN. The Raiders would be guaranteed the No. 1 pick with a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 18. A Jets win over the Bills would also clinch the first overall selection for Las Vegas.

A Giants loss would have guaranteed them the No. 1 pick. With a loss to the Dallas Cowboys next week and a Raiders win over the Chiefs, New York (3-13) will get the first draft choice.

Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart had two rushing touchdowns, pushing his season total to nine. The rookie finished 22-for-30 passing for 207 yards, adding 48 yards on the ground. Las Vegas had 231 yards of total offense.

Geno Smith finished 20-for-28 passing for 176 yards. After two more interceptions, Smith has a league-leading 17 picks this season. He exited the game early in the fourth quarter with an ankle injury and did not return. Raiders coach Pete Carroll said after the game that Smith had suffered a high-ankle sprain and would have an MRI on Monday.

“That’s pretty hard to bounce back (from),” Carroll told reporters. “That might knock him out of next week, we’ll have to wait and see.”

Late in the third quarter, Deonte Banks put the game away for good with a 95-yard kickoff return touchdown, extending New York’s lead to 27-10.

Giants wideout Wan’Dale Robinson caught 11 passes for 113 yards, surpassing 1,000 receiving yards in a season for the first time in his four-year career.

Smith leaves with injury

Smith barely put weight on his ankle when the Raiders quarterback walked into the locker room on his own. Smith suffered the injury on the same play he threw an interception on a pass intended for Tyler Lockett. Instead, Dane Belton picked off the pass, Smith’s second interception of the day. Smith struggled against the Giants’ pass rush, and the Raiders’ offense couldn’t get much going until late in the third quarter. Kenny Pickett came in to replace Smith when the offense finally got the ball back nearly nine minutes later. At that point, the game was all but over. — Charlotte Carroll, Giants beat writer

Rookie responds after struggles

Dart had a bounce-back day after the worst performance of his young career in Week 16. After throwing just 33 passing yards last week, Dart came out looking much more like the first-round pick whom Giants fans have come to love over his rookie season. Dart now has nine rushing touchdowns after adding two Sunday. On his first score, Dart powered into the end zone on a designed run, taking a massive hit as he went for the score. The second rushing touchdown came late in the fourth quarter after he led a nearly nine-minute drive to tick time off the clock and help secure the win. Dart showed personality and swagger that were missing last week, and he also showed growth when he ran out of bounds on runs — an evolving part of his game. — Carroll

Great season for Robinson continues

Robinson surpassed 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career, and it couldn’t have come at a better moment. The 2022 second-rounder has played a stellar season as he’s set to hit free agency this offseason and command a nice payday. After top receiver Malik Nabers suffered a season-ending torn ACL in Week 4, Robinson moved into the No. 1 role. The move paid off with Robinson’s best year. — Carroll",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/28171212/GettyImages-2253855689-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-29 21:13:42.671921

Harbaugh said Monday that the team's confidence in Huntley would not factor into the Jackson decision and that if Jackson is ready to play, he will play.","The Baltimore Ravens surprisingly have one more chance to potentially save their season when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 18. Whether Lamar Jackson (back contusion) will be a part of that effort remains up in the air as Baltimore coach John Harbaugh told reporters Monday that the team will have more information about its star quarterback's status come their first practice.

""It's to be determined,"" Harbaugh said. ""He's coming off a very serious injury, and he's working at it -- saw him in here today working at it -- so I think we'll know a lot more on Wednesday.""

Jackson has dealt with a plethora of injuries this year, not just an early-season hamstring strain (missed three games) and his current back contusion. Ankle, toe and knee issues and popped up for Jackson on the injury report throughout the year and he has had just one full week of practice since returning from the hamstring injury. The back contusion was significant enough that Jackson struggled to even toss a ball with a member of the team's training staff in the locker room during the Week 16 game against the New England Patriots, and he did not practice at all leading up to last week's game against the Green Bay Packers.

""It was not good at all early in the week, and it improved as the week went on, and that was cause for optimism,"" Harbaugh said.

NFL playoff picture: Ravens-Steelers to decide AFC North in Week 18; Panthers have two paths to postseason

Tyler Sullivan

After Week 16, the Ravens' playoff hopes appeared slim: Baltimore blew a 11-point fourth quarter lead in a 28-24 loss to New England -- a game Jackson left in the first half after getting kneed in the back by safety Craig Woodson.

Furthermore, the Steelers dramatically held off the Detroit Lions, 29-24. That meant either a Ravens loss or a Steelers win in Week 17 would hand the division to Pittsburgh. But the Ravens did their part, beating the Packers 41-24 behind a 216-yard, four-touchdown performance by Derrick Henry and solid play by Jackson's backup, Tyler Huntley, on Saturday night. Then the Cleveland Browns upset the Steelers 13-6 on Sunday, pushing the AFC North race to the final week.

Huntley, 27, would again get the call against Pittsburgh if Jackson cannot play. He went 16 for 20 for 107 yards and a touchdown and ran for 60 yards against Green Bay.

""A+,"" Harbaugh said after the game. ""A+. Give [Huntley] two pluses on top of that, maybe three. That's how it was. It couldn't have been any better. I just thought [he had] some of the clutch plays -- the kind of plays that you have to make. I see Tyler every day in practice, so I'm not surprised. I see him execute every day in practice, but for him to make the third-down conversions, the scramble plays, the throws, the on-time throws, the accurate throws that he made to run the offense in Lambeau field -- it's loud. In Lambeau Field, to run the offense the way he did, make the checks the way he did, get us in the plays we needed to get in, just A+.""

Hollins hadn’t practiced throughout the week, but he did finish last week’s game against the Ravens. Head coach Mike Vrabel said Monday that the injury did occur against the Ravens.

Hollins can’t return until the AFC Championship Game at the earliest. It sounds like the 32-year-old wide receiver could potentially be available by that time, however.

“We won’t be able to see him for another three weeks, so at that point in time, then we would make a decision, and I hope that’s one that we could make,” Vrabel said. “But right now, I don’t think I can predict anything.”

Hollins finishes the regular season with 46 catches for 550 yards and two touchdowns. He’s also contributed as the Patriots’ best blocker in the run game and on special teams.

With Hollins and Kayshon Boutte (concussion) out Sunday, rookies Efton Chism and Kyle Williams took on bigger roles in the 42-10 win over the Jets. Chism caught two passes for 40 yards and a touchdown, while Williams hauled in three passes for 20 yards.

Unfortunately, Chicago didn't make it out of the game unscathed as rookie wide receiver Luther Burden III suffered an injury on the final play of the game.

Burden suffered an apparent left leg injury on the Bears' final play, where they were attempting to complete their seventh fourth-quarter comeback of the season. Unfortunately, the comeback attempt fell short, and Chicago lost Burden in the process.

With Rome Odunze sidelined, Burden was the top receiver for Williams, and he didn't disappoint. After missing last week's game with an ankle injury, Burden returned and had a career outing with eight catches for 138 yards and one touchdown against the 49ers. He played a key role in the offense's powerhouse performance.

Luther Burden injury update

Burden suffered an apparent left leg injury on the final play of the game, where quarterback Caleb Williams was attempting a pass on fourth-and-2 with the game on the line. Burden tried to walk off the field but fell to the ground. After attempting to walk off the field with trainers, Burden was carted to the locker room. According to ESPN's Courtney Cronin, Burden was seen grabbing his left hamstring making his way in for an X-ray after the game at Levi's Stadium. On Monday morning, ESPN's Adam Schefter provided an update saying Burden suffered a quad injury that isn't thought to be serious. He'll undergo additional testing today.

What Ben Johnson said about Luther Burden's injury

Head coach Ben Johnson met with the media shortly after the Bears' loss to the 49ers. He didn't have an immediate update on Burden's leg injury. But Burden did speak to media in the locker room after the game and didn't mention the injury, which is encouraging. When asked how he was feeling, Burden said: ""I gave it my all out there. Tired as hell.""

How much time could Luther Burden miss?

Burden likely will be sidelined for the Bears' Week 18 game against the Detroit Lions, as the No. 1 seed is no longer in play. We'll see specifically what injury Burden suffered and whether he'll be good for a playoff return in two weeks, alongside Rome Odunze.","https://bearswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/29/SBRS/87941693007-2253869100.jpg?crop=4667,2625,x0,y243&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-29 18:59:52.796036

Perhaps Metcalf would've made a big play there.
* Otherwise, my gut tells me that Metcalf would've just been frustrated by the excellent Browns corners and probably would've been hit with a 15-yarder at a critical juncture.
I came away even more impressed by the Browns defense and the way they played the Steelers' short passing game.
But if Rodgers, MVS, Thielen, and Miller learned anything this week, perhaps it shows next.","From the notebook of a sportswriter who expected to re-watch the film of Browns 13, Steelers 6 and count the tragic and countless instances of A.) the lack of an outside playmaker, and B.) a poor performance by Aaron Rodgers.

* I saw neither.

* My lede prior to the re-watch was to pin this on two visions that carried over from last week in Detroit. One was the haunting image of DK Metcalf upon realizing that the whole world had just watched what he had done to the fan hanging over the railing.

* I don't know about you, but I was looking into a mirror there and felt myself at my lowest life moments upon the realization that something was about to change, and change very badly for me.

* That was an image that I believed, before the re-watch, was hanging over the loss to the Browns, as the Steelers wide receivers combined for only 60 yards with Metcalf on suspension.

* But upon the review, I'm really not so sure Metcalf would've made a difference. Not with Denzel Ward playing this week after sitting out their last game with an injury.

* Of course, Metcalf usually works the other side of the field, but I was very impressed with the other Browns cornerback, Tyson Campbell. I thought he was their Player of the Game.

* There was one play that maybe Metcalf would've hit early in the game, the one in which Marquez Valdes-Scantling had Campbell by a step and Rodgers just missed him. I thought that was due more to mistiming and lack of working together than it was a mistake by either Steelers player. Perhaps Metcalf would've made a big play there.

* Otherwise, my gut tells me that Metcalf would've just been frustrated by the excellent Browns corners and probably would've been hit with a 15-yarder at a critical juncture.

* Campbell made another great play on an otherwise decent back-shoulder pass to Adam Thielen on a third-and-6 play soon after the aforementioned throw to MVS.

* The other image from the game in Detroit, which still stands strong for me, can be construed as whining. But whine I must. The image of the huddle by the officials after the final play in Detroit did drive me crazy because of the allowed pitch following a clear stop of forward progress. But I'm just talking about the huddle itself. It occurred because those officials had the guts to call an obvious pass interference on a final and game-deciding play. The officials in Cleveland did not have such courage. Ward clearly interfered with MVS in the end zone on the final and game-deciding play.

* This lack of guts from an officiating crew that called more pass interference penalties than any crew heading into the game.

* As for Rodgers, I expected to re-watch a poor game by him, but I didn't. I came away even more impressed by the Browns defense and the way they played the Steelers' short passing game. Yes, Rodgers could've focused more on beating the limping Browns middle linebacker, but he clearly went at him on the final drive with the game on the line. Should he have gone at him again on the final three plays inside the 7? Maybe. But I doubt a slowed linebacker was much of a factor down close.

* Perhaps just going to Pat Freiermuth because of his guts and hands was the call. I'd love to see that last pass headed in his direction on a do-over. But even game analyst Tony Romo called out MVS in one-on-one coverage with Ward, after earlier in the game saying ""MVS is the one"" who'll step up in place of Metcalf.

* I actually thought he was going to be the one, too. Last week I wrote that the loss of Metcalf could turn into a blessing in disguise since it would force Rodgers to work for two weeks with MVS and Thielen. And when Mike Tomlin mentioned Roman Wilson in the middle of the week as a key replacement, I was dumbfounded. I've seen absolutely zero from Wilson and would've gone with what Rodgers did down the stretch.

* And I lost. So there's that. But I'm only giving my first-take perspective instead of looking into the rearview mirror. I just have no respect for Wilson. Sorry, gang.

* Is Tomlin to blame? That question will go over like a Led Zeppelin in this town, of course, but I saw a team that was totally prepared and played extremely hard. Go through the tape and tell me otherwise.

* Just-missed blitzes. A dropped pick six. A potential pick six had Jack Sawyer not cut inside and stayed down the sideline. A weak roughing call on Cam Heyward, who played extremely well and with urgency all game.

* The Browns hit two big plays on their only touchdown drive. The 42-yarder beat reserve safety Chuck Clark and then a ball was lost by safety Kyle Dugger on the 28-yard TD pass to Harold Fannin. Those were the Browns' biggest plays of the game. On the second drive. Otherwise, I thought the Steelers defense played very well, and once again without well known game-wrecker TJ Watt.

* We know about the Steelers' problems on offense, and in this game they were without their two downfield crushers in Metcalf and Darnell Washington. The second-ranked defense in the NFL had little trouble stopping the Steelers, who'll no doubt draft a wide playmaker early.

* How early depends on whether they sign QB Malik Willis in free agency. But that's a Scott Mitchell-type story that begs more research in the offseason.

* Did the Steelers run the ball enough in Cleveland? I thought so, and particularly at a most critical moment. After Scottie Miller returned a punt 25 yards (team's longest of the season) to the Pittsburgh 43 with 7:03 left, Jaylen Warren gained 7 on first down. On second-and-3, I was expecting offensive coordinator Arthur Smith to get cute. But he didn't. The problem was the Browns. A handoff to Warren lost 1. And on third-and-4, no doubt looking at four downs, Smith ran Kenneth Gainwell and he gained only 1.

* I thought Jonnu Smith played well and got his runs and targets. I thought Freiermuth was covered well on the third-and-mediums. I thought the line played well enough to win, both as run and pass-blockers.

* I've seen criticism of the lack of ""tush push"" on a third-and-1 early in the fourth quarter, when Dylan Cook moved ever-so-slightly to draw a penalty. But without Washington to push from behind, I had no problem with the handoff to Gainwell, who cut back through a massive hole before the play was blown dead.

* The fourth-and-1 go ball to Miller early in the game? I probably wouldn't have called that, but it was a first-half shot at a touchdown. I trust Rodgers, particularly in the first half. It's my same lack of criticism I witheld from the Lions coach last week.

* And I lost, just as the Lions coach lost.

* The Steelers lost, of course. They were beaten on the road by a 4-point underdog of a division rival playing its Super Bowl. Such is life in the NFL.

* Can the Steelers recover to beat the Ravens? I wouldn't bet on it. This is one game in particular in which Metcalf would be a difference maker. But if Rodgers, MVS, Thielen, and Miller learned anything this week, perhaps it shows next.

* We'll all be up late on the edge of our seats once again. It's what this team has given us all season.",https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/883/517/13517883.jpg?width=1200&height=628&crop=1.91:1&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-29 17:59:12.464394

The Browns beat the Steelers on Sunday afternoon, making the Ravens’ trip to Pittsburgh next week the biggest game of the year. Despite the history of this rivalry, it is the first-ever matchup with these exact stakes, per CBS Sports’ Doug Clawson. The winner takes the AFC North crown and the No. 4 seed in the AFC playoff picture. The loser goes home.

Unsurprisingly, the NFL opted to schedule this de facto divisional championship for Sunday Night Football in Week 18, the last game of the regular season. It will be the Ravens’ third primetime game in a row and their seventh this season. In their first six, they went 2-4.

Intense does not begin to describe what the atmosphere in Pittsburgh will be on Sunday night. Heinz Field (now known by the far inferior Acrisure Stadium) will be filled to the brim with rabid Steelers fans waiving Terrible Towels. It will probably be the toughest environment the Ravens have played in all season.

The biggest factor in this matchup will be who is and isn’t playing, mostly on Pittsburgh’s sides. D.K. Metcalf is suspended for another game. T.J. Watt has not played since the first Ravens-Steelers matchup in Week 14 due to a freak lung injury. Darnell Washington broke his arm in Sunday’s loss to the Browns.

But the Ravens have the biggest potential absence of them all: Lamar Jackson, who missed the Ravens’ win over the Packers with a back injury. He did not practice at all last week, meaning there is a very real chance that Baltimore’s season will be on the line with Tyler Huntley under center.

The game will be broadcast on NBC/Peacock on Sunday, January 4 at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Many people will use that phrase as the calendar flips to 2026 and plenty of them won't follow through on that resolution.

Josh Allen is hoping that he won't be part of that group. The Buffalo Bills' star quarterback has been here before with big dreams and even bigger expectations.

Without playoff nemesis Patrick Mahomes looming in the bracket this season, Allen doesn't have to worry about leaping over that impossible hurdle. However, an injury is threatening to impact the Bills' playoff run before it even gets started.

Here's the latest on Allen's foot injury.

Josh Allen injury update

Allen aggravated the right foot injury that he suffered in Week 16, but X-rays were negative after the Bills' Week 17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Head coach Sean McDermott told reporters after the game that Allen was sore and the X-rays were just to make sure nothing else was wrong.

Allen said after the loss that his foot had zero impact. When asked if he aggravated anything, Allen simply said, ""I'm good.""

The quarterback was limited in practice on Dec. 24 and Dec. 25 before being upgraded to a full participant on Dec. 26. Allen was able to play in Week 17, but did appear to be limited throughout. He wasn't moving around with his typical mobility, although the heavy rain and slick field might've played a part in that.

Buffalo was eliminated from AFC East contention with their loss to the Eagles, meaning the Bills will be a wild-card team when the playoffs begin.

They still have multiple seeding possibilities on the line in Week 18 against the New York Jets.

It's unclear if the team will rest starters in advance of the playoffs or elect to play its stars in the regular season's final week.

There is some added intrigue considering Week 18 will be the Bills' last at the current Highmark Stadium. Their new home, New Highmark Stadium, will open in time for kickoff of the 2026 NFL season.

Bills QB depth chart

Josh Allen

Mitchell Trubisky

The Bills only carry two quarterbacks on their active roster. Notably, they do not have a practice squad quarterback either.

If Allen can't go or is limited, Trubisky projects as the one the step in.

Malik Willis, QB Green Bay Packers

Injury: Right AC Aggravation

Projected Timetable: Week 18

Initial Thoughts:

Willis aggravated his right AC sprain but it was likely due to his throwing volume and weather related, with his ligaments eventually having enough and causing pain towards the end of the game. Early reports indicate he should be able to suit up week 18. I would feel good about picking him in DFS entries or any week 18 matchups that you might have.

Josh Allen, QB Buffalo Bills

Injury: Right Foot Aggravation

Projected Timetable: Week 18-TBD

Initial Thoughts:

Allen was spotted heading into the X-Ray room at the end of the game after limping through a good chunk of the second half of the game. The hope is he did not worsen the midfoot sprain that he is likely playing through. Imaging from last week ruled out fracture, but recent imaging would still be helpful to rule out any secondary concern after playing through the injury. They might wind up shutting him down for week 18 to ensure that he is fully healthy for playoffs, but we should hear more as the week goes on.

Geno Smith, QB Las Vegas Raiders

Injury: Right High Ankle Sprain

Projected Timetable: 2026

Initial Thoughts:

He performed his job admirably in landing the first overall pick for the Raiders. The high ankle sprain will keep him out of the last game of the season, leaving it up to Kenny Pickett to crawl through the last 60 minutes of football of their pitiful season.

Javonte Williams, RB Dallas Cowboys

Injury: Shoulder/AC Sprain

Projected Timetable: Week 18-TBD

Initial Thoughts:

Suspecting reinjury of his prior AC sprain that he was attempting to play through. If the team shuts him down, Malik Davis could wind up being an intriguing cheap DFS selection, assuming they role with him ahead of their other backs.

Rashid Shaheed, WR Seattle Seahawks

Injury: Concussion

Projected Timetable: NFL Playoffs

Initial Thoughts:

Average miss at least one week due to concussion protocol, which has huge implications on the Seahawks special teams ability versus the 49ers and secondarily as a WR. Likely leads to a bump to AJ Barner in the pass game if Shaheed cannot suit up in week 18.

Marvin Harrison Jr, WR Arizona Cardinals

Injury: Heel Aggravation

Projected Timetable: 2026

Initial Thoughts:

Per a few pieces on intel on X, he only played a handful of snaps and then did not return. The team likely shuts him down for week 18, leaving it up to Michael Wilson as the lead receiver. Great DFS option.

Devonta Smith, WR Philadelphia Eagles

Injury: Left Side/Oblique

Projected Timetable: Week 18

Initial Thoughts:

Smith was able to return after missing just a few snaps after favoring his left side after twisting awkwardly while trying to come down with a catch. He did not seem limited rest of game, so as of right now I expect him to be able to suit up for week 18.

Harold Fannin Jr, TE Cleveland Browns

Injury: Groin Reinjury

Projected Timetable: 2026

Initial Thoughts:

Fortunately he paid off with two catches and a touchdown before being unable to return to the game due to an aggravation of a groin injury that he suffered in practice on Friday. I would anticipate him missing week 18.

Ja'Tavion Sanders, TE Carolina Panthers

Injury: Ankle Fracture

Projected Timetable: 2026

Initial Thoughts:

With his 2025 season over due to season-ending surgery to address the broken ankle, Mitchell Evans becomes an intriguing dynasty TE stash if your waivers are still open. The Panthers will likely have a hard time trusting Sanders and Tommy Tremble due to their injury histories.

Darnell Washington, TE Pittsburgh Steelers

Injury: Forearm Fracture

Projected Timetable: 2026

Initial Thoughts:

This should not negatively impact him into the 2026 season if you were to acquire low in dynasty, though his usage is inconsistent. Forearm fractures do not come with a negative production dip long-term.",https://www.4for4.com/sites/default/files/articles/USATSI_27896588%20%281%29.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 13:59:07.264396

With a win next week over the lowly Titans, the Jags would have the second-best regular-season record in franchise history.
A win next week over the 49ers and Macdonald will have delivered the Seahawks the NFC’s No.
A win next week would tie the franchise record for regular-season wins, set in John Elway’s final season (1998).","For the second straight year, we’ll have a winner-take-all showdown in the final week of the regular season that will not only decide a division title but also the NFC’s No. 1 seed.

It’ll be the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks meeting Saturday at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., with the NFC West crown and the conference’s top seed on the line (the Detroit Lions defeated the Minnesota Vikings under similar stakes in January).

Credit Kyle Shanahan and his staff: Sunday night’s 42-38 win over the Chicago Bears was the 49ers’ sixth in a row. That’s how a team that sat in third in the NFC West for most of the season has climbed within 60 minutes of a playoff bye. Not only that, but also a win next week would mean the 49ers wouldn’t have to leave their home stadium the rest of the way — and that includes a potential Super Bowl LX appearance.

With just one weekend left in the regular season, all but two playoff spots have been clinched. The AFC North and NFC South winners will claim those next weekend.

In the AFC, three teams still have a shot at the No. 1 seed, though it’s the Denver Broncos’ to lose.

Behind the 49ers’ win over the Bears, the second-best finish of Sunday’s slate came in Orchard Park, N.Y., where Josh Allen battled through a foot injury to lead the Buffalo Bills back from a 13-0 fourth-quarter deficit to the Philadelphia Eagles. But after a 1-yard touchdown run from Allen cut Philly’s lead to 13-12 with five seconds left, Allen missed wideout Khalil Shakir in the end zone on what would’ve been a game-winning 2-point conversion. With that, the Eagles celebrated their 11th win of the season, and the Patriots celebrated their first AFC East title since 2019.

That’s because earlier in the afternoon, Drake Maye played as close to a perfect game as you’ll see in a 42-10 romp over the lifeless New York Jets. The second-year starter finished with five touchdowns and just two incompletions. In a little over a month, Maye — just 23 — could become one of the youngest league MVPs ever.

We’ll have a winner-take-all game next Sunday night in Pittsburgh, where the 9-7 Steelers will host the 8-8 Baltimore Ravens with the AFC North on the line. Pittsburgh coughed up a chance to wrap up its first division title in five years by losing 13-6 to the Cleveland Browns, keeping the Ravens’ playoff hopes alive for another week. Cleveland’s Myles Garrett, still a sack away from breaking the single-season record, suggested after the game that the Steelers’ priorities might’ve been skewed. “I feel like they were more worried about keeping me away from Aaron (Rodgers) than getting the win, and I think that’s what came back to bite him,” Garrett said. He’ll try to chase down Joe Burrow in Cincinnati next week for the record.

The Ravens, who rolled the Packers 41-24 Saturday night behind 216 rushing yards and four touchdown runs from Derrick Henry, could have Lamar Jackson back and will be shooting for a third straight division crown — an impressive feat for a team that stumbled to a 1-5 start.

It’s essentially the same scenario in the NFC South, albeit with a minor wrinkle. The division will most likely be decided Saturday afternoon in Tampa, Fla., where the reeling Buccaneers — who fell 20-17 to the Miami Dolphins on Sunday and are now 7-9 after a 6-2 start — will try to avoid putting the finishing touches on an unthinkable late-season collapse. They’ll host an 8-8 Carolina Panthers team that fell 27-10 at home to the Seahawks. A win for the Panthers would clinch the franchise’s first division title in 10 years. A loss would deliver the Bucs their fifth straight crown.

The only caveat is if the Atlanta Falcons win their final two. That would give the Panthers the edge in a decisive tiebreaker — division win percentage — even if they lose to the Bucs next week. After seeing the Rams on Monday night, the Falcons will host the Saints, winners of four straight, to close the season.

The AFC South remains up for grabs, and Jacksonville has the inside track. A 23-17 win over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday means all the Jaguars have to do is beat the 3-13 Tennessee Titans at home next week to end Houston’s two-year reign atop the division. The Texans, winners of eight straight after Saturday’s 20-16 victory over the Chargers, need a Week 18 win over the Colts and a Jags loss to the Titans to make it three AFC South titles in a row.

The Colts, meanwhile, have dropped six straight and will become the first team in 30 years to start 8-2 and miss the playoffs. After dropping his third game in a row as a fill-in starter, 44-year-old Philip Rivers offered no regrets. “Other than us not winning … it’s been an absolute blast for three weeks,” he said. “If I go back and say, ‘All right, now you know everything’s going to happen, what are you going to do?’ I’d do it all again.” The Colts are considering starting rookie Riley Leonard in Week 18.

Here’s what we learned from Week 17 in the NFL:

It’s SF-Seattle for the NFC’s top seed

A game that featured two Coach of the Year candidates, 11 touchdowns and 80 points came down to one throw. And for a moment there, it looked as if Caleb Williams was about to do it again.

Why not? It would’ve been Williams’ seventh fourth-quarter comeback of the season, and it would’ve kept the Bears’ hopes alive of earning the NFC’s No. 1 seed. Instead, Chicago’s final drive Sunday night — after 15 plays and 58 yards — came up short when Williams’ last pass fell incomplete in the end zone.

For San Francisco, Brock Purdy shook off an early pick-six to play one of his best games as a pro: He led six touchdown drives, including one that pushed the 49ers in front for good with 2:15 left. That’s now back-to-back games for Purdy with five touchdowns. Christian McCaffrey was again a workhorse, with 27 touches, 181 all-purpose yards and a touchdown.

Williams finished with 330 yards and two touchdowns for Chicago.

For the Seahawks, it doesn’t get any simpler: Beat the 49ers next week and the NFC playoffs will run through Seattle for the first time since the Legion of Boom Days. Sunday’s win over the Panthers moved them to 13-3, meaning Sam Darnold is now the first quarterback in history to win 13 games or more in consecutive seasons with two different teams. (Darnold led the Vikings to a 14-3 finish last season after dropping that Week 18 showdown with the Lions.)

AFC to run through Denver?

The Broncos’ 20-13 win over the Chiefs on Christmas night, coupled with the Chargers’ loss to the Texans on Saturday, clinched Denver’s first division title in a decade. The last time the Broncos were on top of the AFC West, Peyton Manning was their quarterback and Von Miller was about to lead them to a championship.

Now the Broncos can set their sights on the AFC’s top seed and lone playoff bye. A win next Sunday over the Chargers would do it.

In the event the Broncos lose, the Patriots would have to beat the Dolphins to earn the top seed. The Jaguars can earn the No. 1 seed only if they beat the Titans and both the Broncos and Patriots lose.

Raiders might soon be on the clock

A year ago, a two-win Giants team rolled the Colts in a Week 17 game that cost New York the No. 1 pick. On Sunday, a two-win Giants team rolled the Raiders in a Week 17 game that could end up costing New York the No. 1 pick.

But it’s hard to blame them — especially rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart — for snapping a nine-game losing streak with a 34-10 victory on Sunday. This team needed a win. Dart threw for 207 yards and ran for two touchdowns in the Giants’ first victory since Oct. 9.

The Raiders, meanwhile, have all the makings of a team deserving of the No. 1 pick. This season has been an utter disaster. Geno Smith has regressed. The defense has been atrocious. A report trickled out this week that the team is beefing with its best player, Maxx Crosby. And Pete Carroll — lured out of retirement to steady a sinking ship of an organization — hasn’t found any answers.

Las Vegas’ reward, with a loss next week to the Chiefs, will be the franchise’s first No. 1 pick since 2007. The Raiders will hope for a better outcome this time. That year, Al Davis used the pick on JaMarcus Russell.

Who’s your coach of the year?

The 2025 season has more worthy candidates than any in recent memory. One could make a legitimate case for seven coaches.

All Shanahan has done in San Francisco is lead the 49ers back to the playoffs — with a shot at the No. 1 seed — despite losing Pro Bowlers such as Nick Bosa, Fred Warner, George Kittle and Purdy for long stretches this season. On Sunday night, Kittle was out and All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams was lost early in the game. San Francisco still found a way, thanks in large part to Shanahan’s play calling late.

Ben Johnson not only unlocked Caleb Williams in Year 2 but also flipped a franchise that hadn’t won double-digit games in any of the past six seasons. Most impressive, perhaps, is how disastrously it all started: The Bears, if you’ll recall, blew an 11-point second-half lead in their season opener to the Vikings, then were routed 52-21 in Detroit a week later. It wasn’t just bad, it was ugly. “It’s a kick in the teeth,” Johnson said that day, fuming at the postgame podium. It looked like the start of another long year in Chicago.

The Bears have won 11 of 14 since. Seven wins have come in one-score games. For a team that slogged through a 10-game losing streak last season, it’s hard to think of a more stunning about-face.

Then again, the Patriots’ Mike Vrabel has a case. From 4-13 to 13-3, Vrabel has accomplished the same thing in New England, changing the entire outlook for a franchise in a matter of months. The Patriots became a bottom dweller in Bill Belichick’s final few seasons, then Jerod Mayo’s lone year, winning just eight combined games from 2023 to 2024. New England was picking in the top five of April’s draft. Heading into Week 18, it’s in contention for the AFC’s top seed.

In Jacksonville, Liam Coen is now just the 11th coach since 1970 to win 12 or more games in his first year as a head coach. He’s done a remarkable job — much like Vrabel — flipping a team that won just four games last season into a Super Bowl contender. And he did so without the 2025 No. 2 draft pick, wideout/cornerback Travis Hunter, who’s missed most of the season due to injury. With a win next week over the lowly Titans, the Jags would have the second-best regular-season record in franchise history.

In Seattle, it took only two years for Mike Macdonald to take what he built in Baltimore as the Ravens’ defensive coordinator and do the same with the Seahawks. A win next week over the 49ers and Macdonald will have delivered the Seahawks the NFC’s No. 1 seed and the franchise’s first NFC West title since 2020. That’s no small achievement any year, but especially this one, with Sean McVay and Shanahan at the top of their games.

The job Sean Payton has done in Denver has probably been taken for granted, partly because the Broncos showed so much promise last season, winning 10 games and making the playoffs with a rookie quarterback. But his three-year body of work has been tremendous: Payton climbed out of $85 million in dead cap money — what the Broncos paid to move on from Russell Wilson — and built his team into a Super Bowl contender in two short seasons. A win next week would tie the franchise record for regular-season wins, set in John Elway’s final season (1998). Payton is now one of two coaches in NFL history — Belichick is the other — to win at least 13 games in a season five times.

DeMeco Ryans, a candidate for this award each of the last two seasons, also deserves mention. He’s built the best defense in the league and lifted Houston from an 0-3 start to 11 wins and counting, plus an outside shot at a third straight division title. The Texans are now the fifth team since 1990 to begin a season 0-3 and make the playoffs.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/29005634/GettyImages-2253870968-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-29 14:59:44.845849

LOUIS — St. Louis Blues forward Pius Suter suffered a right ankle injury Saturday against the Nashville Predators and will be re-evaluated in four weeks, the club announced Monday.

Suter left the Blues’ 3-2 win over the Predators in the third period after he was tripped by the Predators’ Michael McCarron. He returned to finish the game, but afterward, Blues coach Jim Montgomery was still concerned about the play.

“We were worried because it looked like a slew foot from where we were,” Montgomery said. “I don’t think it was intentional, but it looked like (a slew foot). A lot of times that can be a bad injury.”

Suter didn’t practice Sunday with the Blues, and the update was that he’d be receiving an MRI in the afternoon.

“Not able to practice today; too sore,” Montgomery said. “He’s going to have an MRI later this afternoon and we’ll have more information for you. Day to day, I would rule him out for (Monday’s game against the Buffalo Sabres).”

The MRI results showed the injury to the right ankle, and now Suter becomes the latest Blues forward to be out long-term with an injury.

The 29-year-old has played in 37 games this season and has 14 points (seven goals, seven assists).

“We’re going to miss him,” Montgomery said. “Just his steady influence of being in position, penalty kill, defensively … as a low center or wing, he’s always in the right spot. We haven’t had enough forwards taking ownership of being reliable, trustworthy and really good at their habits and details defensively.”

What does this mean for the Blues?

Suter has come as advertised when he signed a two-year, $8.25 million free-agent contract with the Blues last summer. He’s in the middle of the pack in scoring with seven goals while averaging 16.5 minutes of ice time and he’s been plugged in on multiple lines at wing and center. His absence for the next four weeks leaves the club without a reliable veteran.

Unfortunately for the Blues, this is not new territory. They’ve been without Jordan Kyrou, Dylan Holloway, Jimmy Snuggerud, Jake Neighbours, Nathan Walker, Alexey Toropchenko and Nick Bjugstad up front this season.

Fortunately for the Blues, they’ve gotten a few of those players back recently with Kyrou and Snuggerud returning on Saturday and they’ve found a few replacements in recent weeks.

The Blues signed Robbi Fabbri to a one-year, free-agent contract and claimed Jonatan Berggren on waivers. They also called up Otto Stenberg, a first-round pick in 2023 (No. 25), and he has fit in nicely.

There’s enough depth that for Monday’s game against the Sabres, Fabbri and Mathieu Joseph will return to the lineup and Berggren will be a healthy scratch.

Here’s a look at the lines:

Neighbours-Thomas-Buchnevich

Stenberg-Schenn-Kyrou

Fabbri-Dvorsky-Snuggerud

Toropchenko-Sundqvist-Joseph

The loss of Suter isn’t ideal, but the Blues could perhaps get a couple of other injured players back before he returns. On Sunday, Montgomery said Bjugstad’s return from an upper-body injury remains uncertain, but out of Bjugstad, Holloway and Walker, he’s the closest to coming back.

The Blues announced on Dec. 15 that Holloway was out with a high-ankle sprain and would be re-evaluated in six weeks, putting his return toward the end of January. On Dec. 2, the club announced that Walker was out with an upper-body injury and would be re-evaluated in eight weeks, also putting his timeline toward the end of January.

In the immediate future, it means that Stenberg has even more of a guarantee that he’ll remain in the NHL, and that Fabbri will not be placed on waivers, which might have happened if everyone were healthy.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/29113957/USATSI_27892149-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-29 13:59:14.675220

Burden suffered the injury on the final play of Chicago's 42-38 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. He attempted to walk off the field with trainers but eventually needed to be carted to the Bears' locker room.

Burden, who also missed Chicago's Week 16 game with an ankle injury, will undergo additional testing Monday, the source told Schefter.

Bears coach Ben Johnson did not disclose specific information about the injury after the game. Burden also downplayed the injury, telling reporters that he ""gave it my all out there"" and that he was ""tired as hell.""

The injury comes at an unfortunate time for Burden, who delivered the best game of his rookie season Sunday night, finishing with eight catches for 138 yards -- both season highs -- and a touchdown.

The Raiders shut down Crosby due to a knee injury, placing him on injured reserve. However, this was a decision with which the five-time Pro Bowler ""vehemently"" disagreed, according to Jay Glazer of Fox. Crosby argued he is healthy enough to play, and wanted to finish out the season. This decision will cause Crosby to evaluate his future with the Raiders organization, according to NFL Media. Glazer reports he spoke with Crosby on the phone, and relayed that the star pass rusher is ""not a happy camper right now.""

Crosby is set to have a meniscus trim, which is not a major procedure. On Saturday, he posted pictures and videos of him playing basketball and on a trampoline to his social media, which showed that he's not in debilitating pain that would force him off the field. The Raiders even felt the need to release a statement explaining their decision to place Crosby on injured reserve:

""After deliberate and thorough consultation with multiple top medical professionals, it became clear that this decision is in the best interest of both the franchise and the player. Maxx is the ultimate warrior, and he has fought extremely hard to compete each week with his teammates since injuring his knee mid-season.

""We are grateful for his extraordinary contributions. He is a true Raider on and off the field. We look forward to his leadership and toughness into 2026 and beyond.""

In 15 games played, Crosby recorded 73 tackles, 28 tackles for loss, 20 QB hits, 10 sacks, six passes defensed and his first career interception. Just nine months ago, Crosby signed a three-year, $106.5 million extension that includes $91.5 million guaranteed. The contract made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history at the time. Crosby wanted to remain loyal to the franchise that selected him in the fourth round out of Eastern Michigan in 2019, even though he's seen just one winning season. It's possible things may have changed.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/28/544dcac9-0280-418a-8cba-a3d6e731bf4c/thumbnail/1200x675/18dd065609e26f32118581357d086e8c/maxx.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 11:59:58.108048

McBride's total also is a franchise record for catches in a season, toppling the 115 of wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins in 2020.
But that wasn't nearly enough for the Cardinals (3-13) against the Bengals (6-10) to snap what is now an eight-game losing streak.
Gannon acknowledged he was down about the loss but added he was proud of McBride and his records.","THE STORY: CINCINNATI – Trey McBride leaped for the ball, a Jacoby Brissett fourth-down pass that had been tipped at the line and popped high in the air.

The tight end grabbed it for an impressive four-yard gain. The problem was it had come on fourth-and-7.

The play was a microcosm of another frustrating afternoon for the Cardinals, who despite beautiful temperatures at Paycor Stadium couldn't get much working in what turned out to be a 37-14 loss to the Bengals Sunday in their next-to-last game of the season.

""When you're on a team like this, you're playing to be an NFL football player,"" defensive lineman Calais Campbell said. ""Teams want winners. You've got to sign your work and show you belong in the NFL. Young guys are learning how to play football, and that's good for them, but overall, it's got to mean something to you.

""The message is simple.""

McBride ended up being the silver lining of a game once again. He had 10 receptions for 76 yards. His last catch was a touchdown, his 119th reception of the season. That total set the NFL record for tight ends in a season, snapping Zach Ertz's mark of 117 set when Ertz played for the Eagles in 2017. McBride's total also is a franchise record for catches in a season, toppling the 115 of wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins in 2020.

But that wasn't nearly enough for the Cardinals (3-13) against the Bengals (6-10) to snap what is now an eight-game losing streak.

""It's really cool, and thankful for my teammates and coaches,"" a quiet McBride said. ""It's cool to get it in 16 games too – I didn't want anyone to give me a hard time about that.

""But honestly, it doesn't really matter. I would've loved to have won the game, loved to have played better as an offense. Just wasn't there today.""

Coach Jonathan Gannon said third downs were the biggest culprit; the Bengals were 10 of 15 (and 9 of 12 at one point) and the Cardinals 3 of 13. The Bengals had scoring drives of 12, 12, 10, 11 plays; the Cardinals' first seven possessions only exceeded three plays twice, and both were five plays long (albeit a Michael Wilson touchdown catch finishing one of those.)

Quarterback Jacoby Brissett didn't surpass 100 yards passing until a 23-yard fourth-down completion to Xavier Weaver in the first minute of the fourth quarter, although a late flurry got him to 212 yards passing total.

""You've got to earn the right to stay on the field,"" Brissett said.

""It's not rocket science. We just have to get out of our own way.""

The Cardinals were only able to gain 42 yards rushing, while Bengals QB Joe Burrow threw for 305 yards and two touchdowns before essentially taking the fourth quarter off. Bengals running back Chase Brown had 101 yards rushing and two touchdowns.

Gannon again emphasized he believed the effort was there from his team.

""I feel good about the guys going out there,"" Gannon said. ""We've got to coach better so they play better.""

When it came to the end of the game, the eyes were on McBride. That was all that was left to determine, and he grabbed everything that came his way. Gannon acknowledged he was down about the loss but added he was proud of McBride and his records.

""I don't want to overlook that,"" Gannon said.

McBride didn't want to either. But in the losing locker room minutes after a game, statistical marks always feel hollow.

""I wish I was more excited about it right now,"" McBride said. ""Maybe after the season, looking back, it'll be something I'll cherish. But right now, I'm frustrated.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cardinals/knnhcjkl4bagushiibw5,N,,2025-12-29 12:00:01.776784

That emphasis lasted exactly one play, as second-year tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders was injured on the first play from scrimmage and did not return, in the 27-10 loss to the Seahawks.
""We're going to miss him a lot because he's been so versatile, a guy that we can really count on,"" Canales said of Sanders.
""I mean, that stuff is tough, man,"" veteran tight end Tommy Tremble said.
Even without Sanders, the Panthers continued to expand the way they use their tight ends.","CHARLOTTE — The Panthers have used multiple tight ends all year long in a lot of different ways, and they continued to add to that Sunday.

But when they lined up with three tight ends for the first play of the game, it was a statement of intent, particularly with the way recent opponents have tried to load up and lean on the Seahawks defense.

That emphasis lasted exactly one play, as second-year tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders was injured on the first play from scrimmage and did not return, in the 27-10 loss to the Seahawks.

He had his right leg in a cast in the locker room and was already on a scooter, and Panthers head coach Dave Canales said he suffered a broken ankle and would have surgery tomorrow.

""We're going to miss him a lot because he's been so versatile, a guy that we can really count on,"" Canales said of Sanders.

The 2024 fourth-rounder had 29 receptions for 190 yards and a touchdown this season — last week's on-on-knee job, which helped them beat the Buccaneers.

""I mean, that stuff is tough, man,"" veteran tight end Tommy Tremble said. ""He's a good player, works hard, and so to see him go down, that was really tough for us as an offense. He's a good kid, good player, and so his going down was hard for all of us, but we've got to learn how to do the next-man-up mentality.

""We're praying for him to be healthy as soon as possible and get back to being right.""

Without Sanders, they weren't able to run some of the stuff they wanted to against the Seahawks, though they mixed backup offensive lineman Jake Curhan in as an eligible receiver on four plays.

""Yeah, it definitely took some of our game out of there,"" Canales said.

But they continued to lean into Tremble and rookie Mitchell Evans as they have all season, particularly on a day when they didn't get a lot going in the passing game (just 54 yards through the air).

""It definitely was a good little emphasis for us, that we were doing that with all of us out there,"" Evans said. ""But when that kind of happens, I think sometimes that happens, and you've got to be able to figure out how to adapt, when something like that happens, and we still have to be able to execute whatever this call and whatever we need to do.""

The Panthers have veteran tight end James Mitchell on the roster, and he appeared in four games this year when Sanders was out with an ankle injury (Weeks 4-6), as well as the Rams game when they were hit with injuries across the roster.

Mitchell has three catches for 28 yards in those four games and has appeared in 34 games over four seasons here and with the Lions.

""There's the utmost faith in James,"" Evans said. ""He's played a lot of ball, honestly. He's played a long time, so he knows his stuff. He knows the offense. He's always in there paying attention when we do our game plan. There's going to be no slouch off with that, and he's already up.""

Even without Sanders, the Panthers continued to expand the way they use their tight ends.

Faced with a fourth-and-1 in the second quarter, they put Evans under center to take the snap and sneak for the conversion. Using the 258-pound Evans instead of the 204-pound Bryce Young makes sense, especially since Evans (a former high school quarterback) did it at Notre Dame as well (where he had eight carries for 13 yards and a touchdown rushing).

""We've had it in for a couple of weeks now,"" Evans said. ""So, the first week when we put it in, we were just practicing it, getting ahold of it, getting that confidence. That's always a little frightening when somebody else is taking on a snap besides the quarterback, which I could see why, from a coach's perspective.

""But now that's on film, so the teams are going to have to prepare for that, have to keep that in their mind.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/v1766961841/panthers/hcabqcb6chndy7ftwt9n,N,,2025-12-29 11:01:21.713164

It was Gardner's first time on the field since Week 13, when he left the Colts' game against the Houston Texans with a calf injury, and he was making the sort of impact the Colts needed from their All-Pro corner.

But with just under six minutes remaining in the third quarter, Gardner left the field of play and was seen speaking with trainers on the sideline. He was not ruled out -- instead, his return was questionable due to a calf injury -- but he did not come back in the game.

Head coach Shane Steichen said after the game that Gardner felt tightness in the same calf he had been rehabbing for the last four weeks, but holding him out was more of a precaution than anything.

""(His) calf was just tight, so we just played it safe,"" Steichen said.

""It was tightening up on me a little bit,"" Gardner said. ""I told him not to rule me out because I was just going to try to just do my thing. But it was tightening up on me, especially when I would get blocked and try to put my weight back against it. But I don't think I've restrained it or nothing crazy.""

Gardner was a full participant in the Colts' Friday practice prior to Sunday's game, and said there was no hesitation in trying his best to get back on the field, regardless of where the Colts stood in terms of making the playoffs.

""That ain't how I operate,"" he said. ""I got so much gratitude for this game, it's a blessing to just be able to go out there and play. It's not just about the playoffs. I don't play this game solely for the playoffs, I play this game because this is my dream, I got a passion for this game.

George Kittle injury update

Kittle is inactive for ""Sunday Night Football"" against the Chicago Bears in Week 17.

He was considered ""highly unlikely"" to play, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.

The tight end is dealing with a sprained ankle that forced him out of action at the end of the 49ers' Week 16 contest. He exited on ""Monday Night Football"" against the Indianapolis Colts and did not return for the fourth quarter.

Kittle was unable to practice all week, putting the 32-year-old's status in doubt for Week 17.

He is expected to test the ankle prior to the game, according to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport.

If Kittle is ruled out, expect Jake Tonges to receive the majority of the receiving workload. Kittle missed five games earlier in the season with a hamstring injury, allowing Tonges to take over as TE1 in Kyle Shanahan's offense.

Trent Williams played just one snap in San Francisco's wild 42-38 win over the Bears on Sunday at Levi's Stadium, exiting after Chicago's game-opening pick-six with a hamstring injury. After the game, coach Kyle Shanahan told reporters he isn't sure about the severity of Williams' injury.

""He tried to go, and he couldn't,"" Shanahan said. ""Trent told me he's never pulled a hamstring before, so I'm not really sure how it'll be.""

Williams originally was listed as questionable to return before the 49ers officially ruled him out in the third quarter. He sustained the injury trying to chase down Bears linebacker T.J. Edwards on the interception.

Second-string tackle Austen Pleasants entered the game in place of Williams, helping the 49ers tally season highs in first downs (32) and yards (496). Pleasants allowed one sack on the night, when Bears defensive end Austin Booker beat him and got to Purdy with a hard hit early in the second quarter.

Shanahan overall was impressed with Pleasants, who had just 12 snaps to his name this season before Sunday's win but sees plenty of first-team reps during the week in practice during Williams' veteran rest days.

“To play that whole game and to not be an issue -- I think we only talked about him on one third down — my sense is he played real good,” Shanahan said.

The focus now turns to how long Williams will be out, if at all. The 49ers face the Seahawks for the NFC West title and No. 1 playoff seed this Saturday at Levi's Stadium, then begin a potential Super Bowl run in the weeks that follow.

Tight end George Kittle, who didn't play Sunday due to an ankle sprain, missed five games earlier this season with a severe hamstring injury. For those counting at home, Super Bowl LX is at Levi's Stadium in six weeks, on Feb. 8, while the NFC Championship Game is scheduled for Jan. 25, in four weeks.

As Shanahan said, the severity of Williams' injury is not yet known. He could miss one week, two weeks or no time at all -- making the No. 1 seed all the more important, which would give San Francisco a bye week before their playoff run begins.

AROUND THE SHIELD — Fred Warner's gruesome season-ending ankle injury may not have ended his season after all.

The former BYU star linebacker revealed during Sunday night's pregame promo of the 49ers' game against Chicago on NBC's Sunday Night Football that he's well ahead of schedule in his recovery from a dislocated and fractured right ankle in Week 6 of the 2025 regular season.

""I've got a chance,"" the 29-year-old said before he was shown in the stands with his wife, Sydney, and the couple's young son. ""That's the plan. So we're going to take this thing one day at a time. There's a whole lot of different steps, and T's got to be crossed, I's got to be dotted, in order to get there. But we're on track.""

San Francisco general manager John Lynch even floated the idea during a radio interview that the team is exploring the return of Warner during a potential playoff run.

""It would be well ahead of the original timeline we were given,"" he said, ""but Fred has the ability to move the doctors because they're going to put objective measurements out there where, 'Hey, if you can reach these, you can get there.' And Fred has continually done that. I think it's made a lot of people kind of re-examine: 'OK, would this be possible?' And I think that's a great thing. So I'm watching him.

""I've consistently said it,"" he added, ""I won't put anything past him.""

Of course, part of the calculation will include consideration of Warner re-aggravating the injured ankle. That may be why NFL.com projected a potential Warner's return to potentially come in spot duty no earlier than the NFC championship game — or even Super Bowl LX, which is scheduled to be held at Levi's Stadium.

Since the three-time All-Pro linebacker's gruesome ankle injury in a 30-19 loss to the Buccaneers on Oct. 12, San Francisco has improved to 12-4 after Sunday's 42-38 twin over Chicago. The 49ers are second in the NFC West, one game back of the division-leading Seahawks' 13-3 with one game remaining.

The two teams conclude the regular season next Saturday in Santa Clara, California (6 p.m. MST, ABC/ESPN).

With five sacks by the Eagles, Allen has been sacked 40 times this season, the most in his career.","ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- Before Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen could take his usual moments to sit in the locker room and process Sunday's loss, he had to take a short walk.

Allen, accompanied by head athletic trainer Nate Breske, limped out of the locker room and across the hallway into the X-ray room.

The good news for Allen and the Bills is that his X-rays came back negative, according to coach Sean McDermott, who also said of Allen's health, ""Nothing new has popped up to this point.""

The bad news is that Allen's right foot, which he injured in a Week 16 win over the Cleveland Browns, became sore once again on Sunday during the Bills' 13-12 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles after that had subsided during the week.

Asked how much he felt the injury affected him during the game, Allen said, ""Zero.""

The defeat cost Buffalo any remaining chance at claiming the AFC East title -- the New England Patriots clinched the division, ending a five-season title streak by the Bills -- and put on display an offense that remains inconsistent amid Allen's injury.

""Coming into the game, I'd be lying if I didn't say I had my eyes on Josh,"" McDermott said. ""Just because of how important he is to us. And we're in the playoffs. But I also know who he is. And he's as competitive as there is, and as good as there is, but I also have a responsibility to protect him to make sure he's as healthy as possible for us as we move into the playoffs.

""You've got to know, to get [No.] 17 off the field, you're gonna have to ... I'm gonna have to wrestle him.""

On the field and in the playcalling, the Bills were inconsistent and had a variety of miscues. The team did not score until 5:11 remaining in the fourth quarter. Then they came up just short of rallying to win on a 2-point conversion attempt with seconds left when Allen missed on a pass intended for wide receiver Khalil Shakir.

""Yeah, I just missed,"" Allen said of the play. ""Rolling left, got to get him a better ball.""

McDermott emphasized that he would make the decision to go for the win again and that he trusts Allen.

""Obviously, a play that we've been working in. It was there,"" Shakir said. ""I mean, me personally, I feel like maybe I could have came out, break a little faster and help 17 out and just make myself a little more available.""

Sunday's outing was Allen's second straight game without a passing touchdown, something he hadn't done since 2020. The team punted six times, lost a fumble by Allen just outside the red zone and had one turnover on downs that ended at the Eagles' 3-yard line. That all came despite the downfield passing game getting going via wideouts Brandin Cooks (four receptions for 101 yards) and Tyrell Shavers (two catches, 36 yards), while the Eagles stifled the league's rushing leader in James Cook III to 74 yards on 20 carries.

Allen said the injury did not affect him, but he attempted 35 passes (with 23 completions for 262 yards) from inside the pocket. It was the first time in his career he attempted 20-plus passes in a game all from inside the pocket.

His scrambling was diminished, as he rushed just two times for 8 yards and zero first downs after entering the contest with the second-most scramble yards (413) in the NFL. He did have two tush push rushing touchdowns.

With five sacks by the Eagles, Allen has been sacked 40 times this season, the most in his career.

There are now decisions to be made by Buffalo in terms of giving players rest, as the team's regular-season finale versus the New York Jets next Sunday will be only for playoff seeding but likely will mark the final game at the Bills' current stadium.

Buffalo starting linebacker Terrel Bernard left in the first half against Philadelphia with a calf injury, while right tackle Spencer Brown took a hit to his left eye -- with jawing between the Bills' offensive line and Eagles' defensive line extending to the walk to the postgame locker room -- that he said needed further examination.

""We've got a lot of things we need to discuss as a leadership group,"" McDermott said. ""You've got the last game in Highmark Stadium here; that's important to me. It'll be important to our guys, to our staff. There are other things that come into consideration. It won't be easy, but it is important that we have a good week here.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1229%2Fr1594595_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-29 01:58:14.642917

Will Darnell Wright play vs. 49ers?

Right tackle Darnell Wright was a late addition to the injury report on Saturday afternoon. Wright, like several other Bears players, has been battling an illness. He did not travel with the team on Saturday, but he's officially questionable. It sounds like Wright could travel separately, to avoid infecting other players. But his status for Sunday night's game against San Francisco is up-in-the-air at this point.

Will Rome Odunze play in Week 17?

The Bears will be without star wide receiver Rome Odunze for the third straight game as he continues to nurse a lingering foot injury. Odunze didn't practice all week, and it sounds like Chicago might be content with resting him the remainder of the regular season before bringing him back for the playoffs. But the good news is that rookie wideout Luther Burden III will make his return to the lineup on Sunday night.

Will Nahshon Wright play vs. 49ers?

Cornerback Nahshon Wright has been a revelation for the Bears this season, and he leads the league with eight takeaways. Wright was limited for the first two days of practice with a hamstring injury and battling an illness that appears to be going around Halas Hall. Wright is officially questionable after not practicing on Friday, and the hope is he'll be good to go. If not, Tyrique Stevenson will see more playing time opposite Jaylon Johnson, who's working his way back to 100 percent.

Will T.J. Edwards play in Week 17?

Linebacker T.J. Edwards once again popped up on the injury report this week with a glute injury suffered during last week's win over the Packers.

Williams was initially listed as questionable after leaving in the first quarter. The 49ers ruled him out at halftime.

Williams sustained the injury on San Francisco's first drive. He was noticeably limping on the sideline and removed his gear to have a seat on the bench after spending several minutes undergoing evaluation in a sideline medical tent.

The injury, if significant, has the potential to impact the 49ers not just for Sunday's game but as they attempt to secure the No. 1 seed in the NFC and into the playoffs. The severity of Williams' injury wasn't initially clear, but hamstrings have the potential to linger as multi-week injuries.

A four-time All-Pro, Williams is one of the best to ever play his position. He earned his 12th Pro Bowl selection this season and remains one of the game's best at 37 years old. He's critical to San Francisco's success in both the run and pass games.

San Francisco entered Sunday's game already down a key offensive player with All-Pro tight end George Kittle sidelined by a sprained ankle. Kittle sustained the injury in Monday's win over the Indianapolis Colts and was questionable on Sunday before being ruled out prior to kickoff.

The 49ers have plenty at stake over the remainder of their season. They entered Sunday's game at 11-4, having already clinched a playoff berth. But with wins over the Bears Sunday night and next week against the Seattle Seahawks, they'd clinch the NFC West and No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs that comes with it.

However, Gardner found himself back on the sidelines mid matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The cornerback has suffered another calf injury and is now questionable to return, the team announced. Already into the fourth quarter, it seems unlikely that Gardner will return for the Week 17 matchup.

If he remains out for Week 18, Gardner's debut with the Colts will end on a whimper. Indianapolis invested heavily into the cornerback, trading a pair of second-round picks to the New York Jets for his services. However, injuries have held Gardner back since his arrival.

Overall, he managed to appear in four games with the Colts, including the Jaguars battle prior to his departure. The defensive back made 16 tackles and three passes defended. Over his entire 10-game season, Gardner earned a 75.1 grade from Pro Football Focus, ranking 14/111 cornerbacks.

Entering the offseason, the Colts will be looking to get Gardner fully acclimated into their defense. He won't be swapping teams in the middle of the year. He'll be able to soak in exactly what Indianapolis wants to do and put himself in a position to make a considerable difference come 2026.

But that can't happen if Gardner isn't healthy. The first order of business will simply be getting past his calf ailment. With the Colts already eliminated, the cornerback will have plenty of time to do so.

Indianapolis sunk plenty of resources bringing Gardner to the Colts. They'll hope the results are much stronger, and healthier next season.",https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sauce-Gardner-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 23:59:49.010751

Crosby, 28, posted two images of himself on a trampoline with his daughter and two videos in which he's playing basketball. The images were posted on Crosby's Instagram story, meaning they won't be available 24 hours after being posted.

The timing of Croby's posts should raise a few eyebrows from Raiders fans, given the team placed Crosby on injured reserve Saturday, citing his need to undergo knee surgery.

Earlier in the week, however, Crosby seemed like he was ready to keep playing in 2025. With the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft potentially on the line Sunday, Crosby told reporters he didn't care about the pick and wanted to win.

The Raiders lost, 34-10, and are now in control of the No. 1 pick with one game left in the season against the visiting Kansas City Chiefs.

The Raiders felt differently, and officially shut down Crosby on Saturday. Once informed of the decision, the star said he wanted to leave the team's facility, which the Raiders allowed. He wasn't the only big-name player shut down by the Raiders ahead of Sunday's defeat against the Giants.

According to NFL Insider Ian Rapoport, Carroll confirmed that Smith suffered a high-ankle sprain during the fourth quarter of the blowout loss. Carroll’s tone wasn’t optimistic, indicating that the veteran signal-caller will almost certainly miss the Week 18 season finale against the Kansas City Chiefs.

Before exiting, Smith had a mixed afternoon trying to spark a struggling offense. He completed 20 of 28 passes for 176 yards and tossed a touchdown to Tyler Lockett, a brief glimmer of their old Seattle connection. However, the day unraveled with two costly interceptions. The final blow came in the fourth quarter when Smith was hurt while trying to make a tackle after his second pick.

The Leeds United centre-back had to limp off in the 31st minute after awkwardly bending his right ankle twice.","Whatever Daniel Farke said to his players at half-time at the Stadium of Light, he should try to repeat the trick.

Within two minutes of the restart, Leeds scored a quite sublime team goal, with all 11 players involved in a 12-pass move that was deftly guided home by Dominic Calvert-Lewin. Of course.

The striker scored for the sixth Premier League game in a row as Leeds came from behind to earn a point at Sunderland.

It could so easily have been more, too: Calvert-Lewin brought the ball down beautifully to feed Brenden Aaronson in the first half, only for his shot to be cleared off the line, and Jayden Bogle and Calvert-Lewin collided in their bid to add a second.

Simon Adringa had put Sunderland ahead after 28 minutes, dispatching Granit Xhaka’s delightful pass with a right-foot curling finish, and Joe Rodon was forced to come off in the 31st minute after two challenges on his right ankle.

Following a draw that puts Leeds United seven points ahead of 18th-placed West Ham United, Beren Cross analyses the key talking points…

A Leeds goal for the ages

Dominic Calvert-Lewin kept himself in the national headlines (and the conversation for a place in England’s World Cup squad) with his seventh goal in six matches, but the build-up to that strike is what should stick in the memory. All 11 Leeds United players touched the ball in a 12-pass move from one end to the other before their No 9 applied the finish.

Jaka Bijol got things moving a couple of yards away from the right side of the away penalty area. There was a small triangle of passes from him to Ethan Ampadu, to Ao Tanaka, to Jayden Bogle, who then went longer to Bijol, back towards the centre.

The Slovenian then went back to Lucas Perri inside the six-yard box. The goalkeeper moved it wide left to Pascal Struijk, who exchanged a one-two with Gabriel Gudmundsson before driving the ball forward to Noah Okafor.

Okafor was still in the Leeds half, but space had begun to open up as he then moved it inside to a marauding Anton Stach. The German had arguably the most important pass in the move as he drove the entire team upfield with a ball into space for Brenden Aaronson.

Aaronson, between the halfway line and the Sunderland area, held off a challenge to carry into the box before slipping a low pass into the six-yard area for another Calvert-Lewin special from close range.

What did this result mean for Leeds?

On another day, Leeds United win this game. After an even first half, they utterly dominated the second period, fuelled by the early equaliser Calvert-Lewin squeezed home in the 47th minute.

By full time, Farke would have wondered how his team were not taking another three points from this excellent run of form they have found. They are now unbeaten in five matches and, most importantly, an extra point away from the drop zone.

Sixteenth place continues to sound precarious, but United are now seven points clear of West Ham United in 18th and only two points behind Bournemouth. An away draw, especially as a new face in the division, is never a bad result, but Farke and his charges will be ruing what could have been.

Furthermore, the character shown to respond again to going behind was admirable. Sunderland have, rightly, been lauded for their performances this season and have been very strong at the Stadium of Light. United would have been forgiven by neutrals for collapsing after falling behind here.

As it was, they stabilised in an even first period before putting their foot on the home throat in the second half. They just couldn’t find that slice of luck, quality, or refereeing decision to tip it their way.

How did Rodon’s injury change the game?

After receiving so many plaudits for breaking the 100 barrier for consecutive league starts, Joe Rodon must have known an unexpected issue would be around the corner. The Leeds United centre-back had to limp off in the 31st minute after awkwardly bending his right ankle twice.

Within the game’s opening five minutes, Rodon was left in a heap after a challenge by Brian Brobbey. Television replays showed the Wales international’s right ankle hyperextended, and he took a little while to gingerly get to his feet.

The 28-year-old did not quickly run it off either. It took several minutes for him to look like he was running anything like comfortably when, unbelievably, he bent the same ankle in the same place.

Adingra challenged Rodon and when he went down, he repeatedly punched the turf, doing several half-rolls in pain, too. Treatment did come from the club’s medical staff this time, but he again hobbled back on to continue.

Rodon struggled on through the throw-in, which eventually saw Sunderland take the lead. He was marginally playing Adingra onside when the pass was threaded to him for a finish.

As the hosts celebrated, Rodon went down and Ao Tanaka came on, switching Leeds back into the 4-3-3 we have seen for so much of this season. It didn’t see much of a change in momentum for the rest of the first half, but the second period started with a United transformation as Rodon watched from the bench with his right ankle in a protective boot.

What was said after the game?

Speaking to Sky Sports, Calvert-Lewin discussed his knack for scoring goals from the centre of the pitch: “I think it’s something that, when you find a good rhythm and good momentum, the timing seems to come with it. As a centre-forward, you can make a lot of runs sometimes and not get the ball, and you need a lot of things to come together for it to be a goal, so thankfully at the moment my form is good and I’m getting in the right places and I’m scoring goals.”

The forward also praised his team-mates for providing those chances. “Everything feels quite fluid at the moment,” he said. “I’m getting in the right areas and people are finding me. I think it’s taken a little bit of time for players around me to maybe learn my game and what I’m good at, but I like to think when I get service and the ball comes to me, I’m lethal in the box.”

What next for Leeds?",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/28103433/GettyImages-2253806976-scaled-e1766936149449.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-29 01:58:21.495539

Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said following Pittsburgh's 13-6 loss that Washington has broken his arm.

Washington was seen after the game wearing a cast and sling over his injured arm. His availability moving forward is not currently known. The Steelers host the Baltimore Ravens next week in a game that will determine which team will win the AFC North and the playoff spot that comes with it.

Washington caught both of his targets for 15 yards prior to exiting Sunday's game. A former third-round pick, the 6-foot-7 Washington was in the midst of his most productive season to date with a career-high 31 catches through 16 games.

""Yeah, Darnell is a big part of what we do,"" Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said when asked about how Washington's absence impacted the offense.

If Washington is out for a significant portion of time, Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth would likely have a bigger role in the offense. Neither player, however, is as good as a blocker as Jones, who is often used in offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's offense as a pseudo tackle.

Along with Washington, the Steelers played the entire game without DK Metcalf, who also won't face the Ravens next week as part of his two-game suspension stemming from last week's altercation with a Lions fan. The absences of both players clearly had a negative impact on Rodgers, who threw for just 168 yards on 21 of 39 passing.

""We didn't execute very well on third downs,"" Rodgers said. ""I didn't have a very good game. Didn't run the ball early like we wanted to. Pretty bad on third down.""

One Steelers offensive player who did have a good game Sunday was Jaylen Warren, who rushed for a game-high 64 yards on 12 carries. Warren is among Pittsburgh's skill players who will have to pick up the slack even more next week with Metcalf out and Washington's status in question.

The Ravens entered Saturday needing three things to happen over the next two weeks to win the AFC North and qualify for the playoffs. They took care of the first part with their victory over the Packers. Now comes the most unlikely step. The Ravens need the last-place Browns to beat the Steelers on Sunday for the Week 18 Baltimore-Pittsburgh matchup to have any playoff ramifications.

If the Steelers win, the Ravens are eliminated from playoff contention. If the Browns pull off the upset, next week’s Ravens-Steelers game will be for the AFC North crown. At least, the Ravens have forced the Steelers to win it outright.

Micah Parsons and Devonte Wyatt aren't coming back to save this Packers run defense. In their first game without Parsons last Saturday, the Packers surrendered 150 rushing yards on 26 carries (5.8 YPC) against the Bears before allowing a whopping 308 yards on the ground from 52 carries (5.9 YPC) against the Ravens.

Derrick Henry ran all over Green Bay's depleted front for 216 yards on 36 carries (6.0 YPC). Not having their two best defensive linemen is only so much of an excuse, though, and the Packers will have to be far better up front against whoever they face in the first round of the playoffs. With a loss on Saturday, the Packers locked up the No. 7 seed for the third consecutive season.

Ravens coach John Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Todd Monken listened to questions all week about why Derrick Henry did not see the field in the final two drives of the 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots. They seemed determined not to make the same mistake again. Henry had 15 carries with less than two minutes elapsed in the second quarter. He had five games this year in which he didn’t get 15 carries.

He had 21 carries at halftime, just four off his season high. He had 27 through three quarters, two over his season high. It’s easy to question why the Ravens haven’t leaned harder on Henry all year, but for one night, they did — and the Packers struggled to stop him.

As if the Packers hadn't suffered enough injuries this season, five more players suffered injuries Saturday and were ruled out for the remainder of the game. Backup safety and ace special teamer Zayne Anderson (ankle), reserve defensive tackle Jordon Riley (Achilles) and backup cornerback Kamal Hadden (ankle) were all carted off. Cornerback Nate Hobbs (ankle) and wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks (concussion) also went down and didn't return.

Add that group to the list of defensive end Micah Parsons, tight end Tucker Kraft, defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt, center Elgton Jenkins and tight end John FitzPatrick already out for the season.

There has been plenty of talk in recent weeks about how much money Malik Willis is earning himself in the offseason. But Tyler Huntley, the Ravens’ No. 2, is doing pretty well for himself, too. Starting in place of Lamar Jackson, Huntley ran Baltimore’s offense beautifully, leading the team to its most points since Week 2. Every chance he’s gotten to play this year, he’s handled himself really well, and he’s played a key role in arguably Baltimore’s two most impressive wins this season, against Chicago and Green Bay.

Huntley had to wait around a long time this summer to get a job offer from the Browns. He probably won’t be waiting that long this coming summer.

Malik Willis is going to get a hefty bag this offseason and deservedly so. The Packers' backup quarterback continued to look like an NFL starter in completing 18-of-21 passes for 288 yards and one touchdown against Baltimore while running nine times for 60 yards and two touchdowns before re-injuring his right shoulder midway through the fourth quarter.

The Packers' acquired Willis for a seventh-round pick on the eve of the 2024 season and the deal has been a bargain. After crashing out in Tennessee, Willis has proven himself as a thrower and a runner.

Tyler Huntley also spoke after Baltimore's win: “It was a must-win and we got it done.”

Huntley says he wants to get out of his news conference so he can give his old teammate Shedeur Sanders a call and offer him encouragement. Sanders is starting for the Browns against the Steelers tomorrow, and the Ravens need Cleveland to win to remain in contention for the playoffs.

John Harbaugh speaking after Baltimore's victory: “A heart-defining win is what that was.”

He says that Derrick Henry authored one of the greatest performances he’s ever seen. He also adds that Tyler Huntley couldn’t have played any better, calling him “A plus.”

Asked about the play, Valdes-Scantling said, ""The ball went up, and [Ward] did a good job of playing through me.
A loss ends the Steelers' season and gives their rival the AFC North title and playoff berth.
""Because we've done it all season,"" Rodgers said, explaining the root of that confidence.","CLEVELAND -- Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Darnell Washington sustained a broken arm in Sunday's 13-6 loss to the Cleveland Browns, coach Mike Tomlin said.

He added he doesn't know Washington's timeline to return.

Washington exited late in the first quarter as the Steelers' leading receiver at that point with 15 yards on two catches on two targets. His longest catch went for 11 yards on third-and-16. Though Washington was short of a first down, the Browns were flagged for taunting at the end of the play to continue the Steelers' drive for an eventual field goal.

""Darnell is a big part of what we do,"" said quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who completed 21 of 39 attempts for 168 yards.

Washington's absence was especially significant for an offense that also played without its top two wide receivers in DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin III (hamstring).

The Steelers will be without Metcalf, who had a season-high 148 receiving yards in the first meeting with the Baltimore Ravens, for the Week 18 de facto AFC North title game as he serves the second game of a two-game suspension for an altercation with a fan in Detroit, and now they also could be without Washington.

""It was an impact,"" Tomlin said of missing Metcalf against the Browns. ""But we certainly got capable men, and we expect those guys to make necessary plays, and we certainly didn't make enough today.""

Washington, who has 29 receptions for 349 yards and a touchdown this season, is also instrumental in the Steelers' tush push play, often the primary pusher behind tight end/fullback Connor Heyward. The Steelers lined up for only one tush push against the Browns in a play that turned out to be a fake and a 29-yard gain by Heyward.

""We get challenged with the attrition component all the time,"" Tomlin said, explaining the impact of Washington's absence on his short-yardage decision-making. ""We make no excuses regarding that. We got capable men. We adapt, adjust, and we keep moving.""

With the trio of pass catchers out, the Steelers turned to a collection of midseason pickups and under-the-radar receivers to fill the void. The group was largely ineffective as the Steelers averaged only 3.9 yards per completion and failed to score a touchdown for the first time all season.

Facing fourth-and-1 from Cleveland's 22-yard line as the Steelers trailed 10-3 late in the second quarter, Rodgers opted to take a deep shot to receiver Scotty Miller in the end zone. In the past, the Steelers have utilized the tush push in those situations. This time, though, Rodgers' 50-50 ball to Miller was too high, and the Steelers squandered a scoring opportunity created by rookie Jack Sawyer's interception of Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders.

Rodgers also targeted wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling, his former Green Bay teammate who was signed from the Steelers' practice squad to the active roster earlier this month, nine times, including three in a row from Cleveland's 7-yard line with seconds left in the game.

""[Rodgers] had eligibles on the play, and certainly [Valdes-Scantling] was one of them, and he's a capable guy,"" Tomlin said. ""I got no qualms about us playing to win the game in the way that we did.""

Rodgers and Valdes-Scantling didn't appear to be on the same page for his second-and-goal throw with 24 seconds left, and Rodgers was nearly picked off by Denzel Ward in the end zone. He went back to the receiver on the next play, but again, Valdes-Scantling wasn't where Rodgers anticipated him to be. This time, Rodgers threw inside, but the receiver stayed wide on the right side of the end zone.

With one final shot to tie the score, Rodgers again looked for Valdes-Scanting, but this time he was blanketed by Ward, and the pass fell incomplete.

""That was definitely interference,"" Rodgers said of the fourth-down play by Ward on Valdes-Scantling.

Asked about the play, Valdes-Scantling said, ""The ball went up, and [Ward] did a good job of playing through me. I thought I could've got a call, but no call was made. That's what it was.""

Tight end Pat Freiermuth finished as the Steelers' leading receiver with 63 yards on three receptions in five targets.

With the loss, the Steelers enter Week 18 facing the highest stakes of the season. A win against the Ravens would send Pittsburgh to the postseason. A loss ends the Steelers' season and gives their rival the AFC North title and playoff berth.

Rodgers, though, expressed confidence in his team to bounce back.

""Because we've done it all season,"" Rodgers said, explaining the root of that confidence. ""We've handled adversity well, and when we had to play our best ball, we did -- other than today.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1228%2Fr1594453_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 19:57:48.424133

He orgibally poppoed up on the injury report with an abdominal injury before the Patriots decided to place him on injured reserve.","The New England Patriots surprisingly placed Mack Hollins on injured reserve on Saturday, and former Patriots quarterback Brian Hoyer was “crushed” by the news.

“Looking forward to see the game plan the Pats come up with today with the injuries they’re dealing with,” Hoyer wrote on X before Sunday’s game. “Losing Hollins crushed my soul!”

Hoyer won a Super Bowl with the Patriots in 2018. Hoyer played in 30 games for the Patriots over the course of eight seasons, serving as a backup for most of his career. He played more games for the Patriots than any of the other seven teams he played on in his 15-year career.

Hollins has been a phenomenal addition to the Patriots. He was third on the team in receptions and receiving yards. He had played 68% of the Patriots’ snaps on offense this year, which is more than any other receiver.

The biggest reason Hollins stays on the field is because of his ability as a blocker. At 6-foot-4, 221 pounds, his size plays a huge role in the run game. He is an important part of what the Patriots are trying to achieve in the ground game, but his build makes him different than the other receivers on the team.

Story continues below advertisement

Hollins has been a great presence in the middle of the field, catching balls in traffic, but he is also a real deep threat that challenges defensive backs in the air. The Patriots do not have a direct replacement for his size in the receiver room, so younger players will need to step up in their own way.

Hollins could return at some point this season, but it will take a deep run in the playoffs. He could be eligible to return in the AFC Championship Game or the Super Bowl.

What’s the New York Giants Injury Report for Week 17?

The Giants will enter Week 17 of the 2025 NFL season with just a 2-13 record as they have lost each of their past nine consecutive games. Their focus can now turn to the future, especially continuing to develop promising rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, but they will be without several of their key players when they take on the Raiders this week.

Star offensive tackle Andrew Thomas, an important protector of Dart, has officially been ruled out with a hamstring injury. He was unable to practice at all this week, so his injury designation doesn’t come as much of a surprise, but his absence is surely notable.

New York will also be missing other key offensive linemen in John Michael Schmitz and Evan Neal, so their protection will be compromised against Las Vegas. They will also be without starting tight end Theo Johnson, further weakening their offense as a whole. He was a late addition to their injury report with an illness that resulted in him being inactive for this contest.

Their defensive secondary will be missing safety Tyler Nubin, who was held out of practice all week with a neck injury. On the positive side, cornerback Deonte Banks does not have a designation on the final injury report, despite being limited at practice with a shoulder injury.

Brock Bowers was put on the injured reserve list this week with a knee injury, which officially ends his year. He was having another strong campaign as the eighth-ranked tight end in PFSN’s Impact Rankings for this season, but will now be unavailable for their final two games.

He is joined by their superstar edge rusher, Maxx Crosby, who has also been ruled out with a knee injury of his own. He reportedly wanted to play in this game against the Giants, despite not practicing all week, but Las Vegas still decided to rule him out when they take on New York.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/28104925/giants-raiders-injury-report-12-28-25-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 19:58:12.347968

At halftime, with the Colts leading 10-7, Thomas hasn’t been too involved and also suffered an injury

What’s Happening With Jaguars WR Brian Thomas Jr.?

In that second quarter, Thomas spent time on the Jaguars’ sideline getting checked out.

According to a report from ESPN Jaguars reporter Michael DiRocco, Thomas was being checked out for an ankle injury.

“Trainers were looking at Brian Thomas Jr. left ankle/foot,” DiRocco wrote. “He’s on the sideline now, walking around.”

Thomas only has one catch for four yards and has only been targeted by Lawrence on that one play. Thomas did return to the game, but his injury situation will be worth keeping an eye on as the game progresses.

Thomas was a first-round draft choice (No. 23 overall) by the Jaguars in the 2024 NFL Draft. He played his college ball at LSU.

According to the PFSN NFL WR Impact metrics, Thomas has an impact score of 71.1 and grades out to a C-. So far this season, Thomas has 41 catches for 619 yards and two touchdown receptions. He’s averaging 15.1 yards per catch for Jacksonville this season, which has really helped Lawrence and the Jaguars’ offense.

In almost two seasons with Jacksonville, Thomas has 128 catches for 1,901 yards and 12 touchdown receptions. His career-long reception is an 85-yarder, which came in his rookie season. One thing that Thomas has going for him is ball control. He’s not fumbled once while playing with the Jaguars.

Is Thomas an option when the Jaguars look to run the ball? It’s a rather small sample size, but he has nine carries for 69 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown.

While Thomas has returned to the game against the Colts, a big one for Jacksonville, head coach Liam Coen and the team’s medical personnel will closely monitor him. Jacksonville really needs all hands on deck against Indianapolis and quarterback Philip Rivers.

But the Jaguars are going to have to come back in the second half after going into halftime down three points. Let’s see if Thomas has a bigger role in the Jaguars’ offense.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/28141439/auto-draft-12-28-25-9-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 15:58:01.948806

“Steelers TE Darnell Washington has a forearm injury and is questionable to return to today's game,” Lauten wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

The news didn't get any better as Washington was later ruled out for the game. It was a big development for the Steelers, as they're already without DK Metcalf after he was suspended for the last two games of the regular season because of the incident he had with a Detroit Lions fan last week.

Aaron Rodgers now has to find a way to spread the ball around to his other receivers, and he may have to rely on the run game, which has not been that effective this season. Nonetheless, the Steelers have found ways to win with less this season, and as long as Rodgers is playing, they have a chance.

The offense is the only group for the Steelers who is missing key players. TJ Watt has missed the past few games because of a lung injury, but he should be back on the field. Despite the injuries, the Steelers are still at the top of the AFC North, and the Baltimore Ravens are creeping right behind them. A win or a tie against the Browns will help them clinch the division.

On the other hand, if they were to lose, then it would come down to the final week of the season to decide who will win the division. between them and the Ravens.

Week 17 storylines

Jacksonville are chasing a 12-win season for the third time in franchise history. They will not be able to match the 14 wins of 1999, but can level the 12 wins of 2005. Jacksonville have won six in a row with Indianapolis losing their last five. After locking up a playoff place, a win will keep Jacksonville on top of the AFC South after Houston’s win yesterday.

Trevor Lawrence is humming - he has 10 touchdowns in his last two games (eight passing and two rushing) - and the passing game is one of the league’s most productive and varied, with five different leading receivers in their last five games. But the ground game has stalled somewhat. In their last four games, the Jags average 90.5 rushing yards per game, fewest in the NFL. No one has scored more touchdowns than Travis Etienne since Week 11 (9), but he is without a 100-yard rushing game since Week 4’s win over the 49ers.

And the offensive line has been in a constant flux all season, a trend that continues. Right guard Patrick Mekari (back) and center Robert Hainsey (groin) miss today’s game.

Without the ball, Anthony Campanile’s unit is still the NFL’s No 1 run defense, with Jacksonville allowing 81 rushing yards per game in their last six games. With 28 takeaways, second-most in the NFL, Jacksonville have scored 100 points off takeaways, the highest in the league.

How many yards will Joe Burrow and the Bengals passing attack be able to put up today? The Cardinals defense is beat up and has not played well. Their injured corners were listed as questionable and are active on Sunday, but it still presents a significant mismatch against a full healthy Bengals passing attack. They showed off where they are at least week ripping off 45 points against the Dolphins, Burrow throwing for four touchdowns and 309 yards. The potential exists for this game to go in a similar fashion. Expect the Cardinals to bring pressure early and often to try to cause disruption, which opens up the possibility of Burrow finding explosive plays to Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, among others.

A true win for the Bengals on Sunday would involve Burrow and the receivers staying healthy considering neither team has anything to play for, but adding one more dominant offensive performance wouldn't hurt considering nearly the entire offense is back under contract next season.

Defensively, seeing production from Shemar Stewart would go a long way. He's finally back playing and healthy but wasn't much of a factor last week against the Dolphins coming back off IR. He's one player that could use positive momentum to help launch him into a critical offseason after what feels like a wasted rookie year.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. – The Patriots are entering Sunday’s game here against the Jets with only four wide receivers active since their top two receivers (in terms of playing time) are sidelined.

So without Mack Hollins (abdomen) and Kayshon Boutte (concussion) a bigger role is going to fall on rookie receivers Kyle Williams and Efton Chism.

Williams, a third-round pick in April, has played better of late after a slow start, but still has just seven catches this season, though he’s turned those receptions into 189 yards and three touchdowns. Chism was a training camp standout, but has been a healthy scratch in nine of 15 games this season and doesn’t yet have a reception.

Stefon Diggs will be the team’s no-doubt top receiver on Sunday. But if he draws extra attention from the Jets’ defense, Williams or Chism may need to step up. So it’ll be interesting to see how the rookie receivers respond on a day the Patriots enter with a banged-up roster, hopeful some of their young players will aptly fill the void.

The Browns will have their leading receiver, tight end Harold Fannin Jr. available for today's game vs. Pittsburgh despite a late-week injury scare.

Fannin has been targeted by Shedeur Sanders 42 times in Sanders' five starts, and Fannin's 70 receptions this season are a franchise single-season record for a rookie. Fannin was listed as questionable after he suffered a groin injury in practice on Friday, but the Browns went through their weekend activities believing Fannin would be able to play.

Sanders, Fannin and Myles Garrett remain the primary reasons Browns fans might still be watching as their 3-12 team tries to play spoiler against a Steelers team that clinches the AFC North with a win. Garrett has 22 sacks and is just a half-sack short of the single-season record currently shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt, who won't play today due to injury.

With No. 1 wide receiver D.K. Metcalf serving a two-game suspension, expect the Steelers to focus on the run and a quick pass game focused on their tight ends and running backs. That might or might not also include an extra emphasis on avoiding and minimizing Garrett, which is something the Browns see almost every week. The last time Garrett didn't have at least a half-sack in a game was Week 6 in Pittsburgh, and Garrett has never sacked Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

Sanders is trying to play his way into the team's future plans, and he'll have to operate today without primary running back Quinshon Judkins, who suffered a season-ending leg injury last week. Running back Dylan Sampson returns from a hand injury and figures to lead a running back committee that will also include Raheim Sanders and Trayveon Williams. Sanders has thrown six touchdown passes and eight interceptions and today faces a veteran Pittsburgh defense that wants to force turnovers on its way to clinching the division.

The Browns have Pro Bowl cornerback Denzel Ward back from a two-game absence. Slot cornerback Myles Harden will not play today due to a shoulder injury.

Dillon Gabriel, the Browns' usual backup quarterback, is inactive today due to a shoulder injury. The Browns promoted Bailey Zappe from the practice squad to be Sanders' backup. Besides Gabriel, and Harden, the Browns' other inactives are tight end David Njoku (knee), defensive tackle Sam Kamara (elbow), wide receiver Jamari Thrash and backup offensive linemen Jerremiah Byers and Kendrick Green.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. – The Patriots probably aren’t going to lose to the Jets, but this is a surprisingly big test for them as the playoffs loom.

That’s because the Patriots are dealing with a lengthy injury report that could linger into the postseason. So Sunday’s matchup against the Jets, while not expected to be a nailbiter, could be revealing about how ready the Patriots are.

There are two especially interesting positions to follow.

The first is wide receiver. The Pats placed Mack Hollins, who has played more at receiver for them than anyone else, on injured reserve Saturday due to an abdomen injury. They’re also without Kayshon Boutte (concussion), who has played the second-most snaps for them at wide receiver. They only have four healthy wide receivers entering Sunday’s game here, so expect plenty of jumbo formations from them with a focus on running the ball.

The second spot is defensive tackle. While Milton Williams, the team’s highest-paid player, was cleared to return to practice this week, he was not activated off injured reserve before the game. Additionally, Khyiris Tonga (foot) was ruled out of Sunday’s game, so the Patriots will enter with an inexperienced rotation of Cory Durden, Eric Gregory, Jeremiah Pharms Jr., and Leonard Taylor III. There’s opportunity there for the Jets to run the ball on this D-line.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/h6xAKkNbrCFg_Yt7BFCFJxQKR_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-28 12:58:51.254177

George Kittle, TE, SF (ankle): The fantasy playoffs and Sunday night game-time calls do not go well together, but here we are.
Theo Johnson, TE, NYG (illness): He's not traveling to Vegas, so either Daniel Bellinger or Chris Manhertz could collect his targets.
Mason Taylor, TE, NYJ (neck): Stone Smartt and Jeremy Ruckert will split the TE duties, with Smartt more likely to end up in the box score.
Tetairoa McMillan, WR, CAR (illness): McMillan was added to the injury report Sunday morning, which certainly raised a lot of red flags.","Rome Odunze, WR, CHI (foot): Odunze was ruled out early in the week, but Luther Burden III (ankle) was removed from the team's final injury report. Burden may be the most reliable option at receiver because both DJ Moore and Olamide Zaccheaus were added to the Bears' injury report on Sunday morning due to illness. Those receivers are now both questionable.

George Kittle, TE, SF (ankle): The fantasy playoffs and Sunday night game-time calls do not go well together, but here we are. It's best to have Jake Tonges available for a potential pivot, because reports from Sunday morning seem to indicate that Kittle is unlikely to play.

Ricky Pearsall, WR, SF (knee): If the injury-plagued receiver can't go, then Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson would likely get some extra looks. However, as of Sunday morning, it was looking likely that Pearsall would play.

Matt Prater, K, BUF (quad): Michael Badgley gets another opportunity to prove he still belongs on an NFL roster.

Anthony Richardson Sr., QB, IND (eye): He's not going to be activated from IR this week, so both Philip Rivers and Riley Leonard will be active for the Colts. Houston won on Saturday, eliminating Indianapolis from playoff contention, so aside from ""nostalgia,"" it makes little sense to start Rivers anymore -- but that won't stop it from happening.

Jason Sanders, K, MIA (hip): Sanders continues to practice with the team, but he is clearly not yet ready to be activated from IR. Riley Patterson continues to handle kicking duties.

Kayshon Boutte, WR, NE (concussion): There are only three fully healthy WR options for the Patriots: Stefon Diggs, Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III.

Mack Hollins, WR, NE (abdomen): Hollins goes on IR. DeMario Douglas (hamstring) is active, but we still may see a little extra work for No. 2 TE Austin Hooper.

Alvin Kamara, RB, NO (knee): Audric Estime and jack-of-all-trades Taysom Hill will likely split backfield duties.

Theo Johnson, TE, NYG (illness): He's not traveling to Vegas, so either Daniel Bellinger or Chris Manhertz could collect his targets.

Mason Taylor, TE, NYJ (neck): Stone Smartt and Jeremy Ruckert will split the TE duties, with Smartt more likely to end up in the box score. As expected, QB Tyrod Taylor is also inactive.

Calvin Austin III, WR, PIT (hamstring): The unlikely combination of Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Adam Thielen will lead the way in the Steelers' WR room, with DK Metcalf serving the first of a two-game suspension.

Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, ARI (heel): He was limited in practice again this week but is active. While we'd expect him to play at least a little bit Sunday, Michael Wilson should be the WR1 for the Cardinals, with Xavier Weaver also likely to get more looks.

Joshua Karty, K, ARI: If you're one of the 3% of ESPN fantasy managers with Karty still in your lineup this morning, get him out of there. He's a healthy inactive as the Cardinals have opted to stick with Chad Ryland at kicker this week.

Tetairoa McMillan, WR, CAR (illness): McMillan was added to the injury report Sunday morning, which certainly raised a lot of red flags. He is active, but you may have to hold your breath while watching.

Dylan Sampson, RB, CLE (hand): He's active and likely to handle lead back duties. Raheim Sanders and Trayveon Williams should work in tandem as backup options.

Harold Fannin Jr., TE, CLE (groin): Fannin was a late-week add to the injury report, but especially given that David Njoku is still out, all signs pointed to him playing. He is active.

Bhayshul Tuten, RB, JAX (finger): Tuten has been downgraded to out in advance of Sunday's release of inactives. LeQuint Allen Jr. will back up Travis Etienne Jr. on Sunday, though there still remains a possibility we see Tuten again before the season is over.

Charlie Smyth, K, NO (illness): The Saints don't have any other kickers on the roster and made no efforts to rectify that situation in advance of Sunday, so it's no surprise that Smyth is active.

Chris Olave, WR, NO (back): Since Olave traveled with the team to Tennessee, it's not a surprise to see he is active. Mason Tipton (groin), however, is inactive.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1228%2Fr1594209_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 15:58:18.989928

Josh Allen - Bills (QB)

Josh Allen suffered a foot injury in a win against the Cleveland Browns last week. He is expected to play and not miss any time, as the Bills (11-4) look to close the gap on the New England Patriots (12-3) in the AFC East.

TreVeyon Henderson - Patriots (RB)

Henderson suffered a concussion in the win over the Ravens during Week 16. His progression through the NFL's concussion protocol has cleared him to play today against the New York Jets. The Patriots can secure the AFC East with a win and a loss by the Bills.

George Kittle - 49ers (TE)

Kittle sustained an ankle injury against the Colts on Monday Night Football. He will be a game-time decision for Week 17 in a game against the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football. The 49ers have earned a playoff spot already, but can secure a top seed with a win in their final two games, which means Kittle will more than likely give it a go.

Marvin Harrison Jr. - Cardinals (WR)

Harrison Jr. will play in the Week 17 matchup against the Bengals after returning last week from missing two games. He may be limited in this one, so he would be more of a (sit) option this week to be on the safe side.

Seahawks at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams are in good shape in the health department for this pivotal Week 17 clash. The Seahawks are in the driver's seat for both the NFC West crown as well as the No. 1 seed in the conference. Carolina knocked off Tampa Bay last week and, with a win and Bucs loss this week, could clinch the NFC South. Otherwise, Week 18 could be a massive matchup for the division title.

Seattle is favored by 7. The total is 42.5.

Buccaneers at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams have a few players banged up here, but none that move the needle when it comes to betting lines. The Bucs are a game behind the Panthers in the NFC South and, with a win, would ensure that Week 18's rematch with Carolina has high stakes.

New England standout running back TreVeyon Henderson has cleared concussion protocol for Sunday while New York is again without tight end Mason Taylor, who was a rare bright spot in a trying year for the Jets. Explosive Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte is out with a concussion.

The Pats are massive 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.

Steelers at Browns (1 p.m. ET)

CLE RB Quinshon Judkins (ankle, out for year)

CLE RB Dylan Sampson (hand, available)

CLE TE Harold Fannin Jr. (groin, available)

CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)

PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)

The Browns are looking to play spoiler here, and their offense is hurting. Star rookie back Quinshon Judkins is out for the year after ankle surgery, so fellow rookie Dylan Sampson is the team's RB1 this week. He's active after missing the last two games. David Njoku is out again with a knee injury and fellow tight end, standout rookie Harold Fannin Jr., is good to play. The Steelers will still be without T.J. Watt this week after the star edge rusher underwent surgery to repair a collapsed lung. He returned to practice this week but will not suit up until Week 18 at the earliest.

Pittsburgh is a 3-point favorite on the road, and the total is 34.5 -- the lowest of Week 17.

Jaguars at Colts (1 p.m. ET)

IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, available)

The Jags are relatively healthy here, while the Colts, who started the year 8-2, are trying to win out and get some help to sneak into the postseason as a wild card team. Indianapolis traded two first-round picks at the deadline for cornerback Sauce Gardner, who will return to the lineup after a lengthy absence. The Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win here if the Texans also lose to or tie with the Chargers on Saturday.

Jacksonville is a 5.5-point favorite. The total is 48.5.

Saints at Titans (1 p.m. ET)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)

NO WR Chris Olave (back, available)

The Saints will again be without standout running back Alvin Kamara, though they found an interesting replacement last week in tight end/quarterback/running back hybrid Taysom Hill, who had 78 yards from scrimmage and also a passing score to Chris Olave, who is good to go after being listed as questionable.

The Saints are favored by 2.5, and the total is 39.5.

Cardinals at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)

ARI S Budda Baker (concussion and thumb, out)

ARI WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, available)

Both teams have crowded injury reports, but the Cardinals continue to have some awful luck in that department for Week 17. Star safety Budda Baker is out, putting a dent in an already poor Arizona defense. The offense got Marvin Harrison Jr. back last week and he's active again this week despite battling a heel injury.

The Bengals are 7.5-point favorites. The total is 53.5 -- the highest of the week.

Giants at Raiders (4:05 p.m. ET)

LV DE Maxx Crosby (knee, out)

LV TE Brock Bowers (knee, out for year)

Star Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby is out this week against the Giants, and there's reportedly drama between him and the team. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, the Raiders told Crosby they wanted to shut him down for the remaining two games, and he disagreed and left the facility. Additionally, the team placed second-year tight end Brock Bowers on season-ending injured reserve this week.

New York is a slim 1.5-point favorite. The total is 41.5.

Eagles at Bills (4:25 p.m. ET)

BUF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, questionable)

BUF TE Dawson Knox (knee, questionable)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (knee, foot, out)

Buffalo's tight end depth may get tested here with both Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox questionable with knee injuries in this potential Super Bowl preview against last year's champs, the Eagles. Philadelphia will get star defensive tackle Jalen Carter back after a brief absence, but it won't have right tackle Lane Johnson once again.

Buffalo is a 1.5-point favorite, and the total is 43.5.

Bears at 49ers (8:20 p.m. ET)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, out)

SF TE George Kittle (ankle, questionable)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)

This potential NFL playoff preview has a few big-name pass catchers out or questionable. The Bears will again be down second-year receiver Rome Odunze as he battles a foot injury, and Chicago will certainly be aiming to get him back for the postseason. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is questionable after not practicing all week while receiver Ricky Pearsall is in danger of missing his ninth game of the year.

San Francisco is favored by 3, and the total is 52.5.

Rams at Falcons (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, doubtful)

ATL WR Drake London (knee, questionable)

All eyes are on the status of two star receivers as Davante Adams, who leads the NFL in touchdown receptions, is doubtful for the Rams after missing last week's loss to Seattle while Drake London is questionable for Atlanta as he continues to battle a nagging knee injury. The Rams can help themselves in two ways on Sunday as a win helps their playoff standing and also pushes the Falcons further up the NFL Draft order, which is good for L.A. as the team owns Atlanta's first-round pick in April.

Los Angeles is a 7.5-point road favorite. The total is 49.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/11/01/af98ef3e-bf37-4fb4-b709-ff1245354c74/thumbnail/1200x675/0f2b540740d60034c95d45a86cefd9cc/treveyon-henderson-new-england-patriots-imagn-images.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 15:58:28.711036

Let's take a look at who's in and who's out.

Josh Allen - Bills (QB)

Josh Allen suffered a foot injury in a win against the Cleveland Browns last week. He is expected to play and not miss any time, as the Bills (11-4) look to close the gap on the New England Patriots (12-3) in the AFC East.

TreVeyon Henderson - Patriots (RB)

Henderson suffered a concussion in the win over the Ravens during Week 16. His progression through the NFL's concussion protocol has cleared him to play today against the New York Jets. The Patriots can secure the AFC East with a win and a loss by the Bills.

George Kittle - 49ers (TE)

Kittle sustained an ankle injury against the Colts on Monday Night Football. He will be a game-time decision for Week 17 in a game against the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football. The 49ers have earned a playoff spot already, but can secure a top seed with a win in their final two games, which means Kittle will more than likely give it a go.

Marvin Harrison Jr. - Cardinals (WR)

Harrison Jr. will play in the Week 17 matchup against the Bengals after returning last week from missing two games. He may be limited in this one, so he would be more of a (sit) option this week to be on the safe side.

A toe injury will keep him on the sideline for a critical Week 17 matchup, and undrafted rookie Benjamin Chukwuma will start in his place, protecting Baker Mayfield's blind side. It will be the second career start for Chukwuma, who was impressive in his debut against the New Orleans Saints in Week 14.

The Buccaneers ruled out Wirfs and outside linebacker Anthony Nelson (knee) on Friday but otherwise didn't have any question marks headed into the weekend. With Nelson out, Jason Pierre-Paul will likely see more playing time after being elevated from the practice squad for the second week in a row. The Buccaneers need a win on Sunday to ensure that they will be playing for first place in the NFC South in Week 18 against Carolina.

Veteran linebacker Anthony Walker, who played for the Dolphins in 2024, will be active for the first time as a Buccaneer after re-signing with the team on December 15. Walker originally signed with the Buccaneers during the 2025 offseason but spent training camp in the reserve/NFI list and was released in the roster cutdown to 53 in late August. He was on the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad for the balance of the season before the Buccaneers brought him back. Walker has played in 99 NFL regular-season games with 83 starts, including 14 games and eight starts last season for Miami.

The Buccaneers and Dolphins submitted their list of inactives at 11:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, 90 minutes before the scheduled kickoff of their Week 17 meeting at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. The Buccaneers elevated Pierre-Paul from their practice squad for the game and thus had to name six inactives to get down to the game-day limit of 48. The Dolphins had 52 players on their active roster after a series of moves on Saturday and elevated linebacker Derrick McLendon and offensive lineman Josh Priebe from the practice squad to get to 54. That meant they also had to name six players inactive before the game.

The Dolphins will be without starting safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, who is dealing with a calf injury. Miami also had listed cornerback Isaiah Johnson, defensive lineman Benito Jones and wide receiver Dee Eskridge as either out our doubtful on their Friday injury report, but all three were subsequently placed on injured reserve.

Unfortunately, his exceptional performance today might wind up being in vain.

Against the Lamar Jackson-less Baltimore Ravens at Lambeau Field, Willis was doing a pretty good job of moving the ball. He completed 18 of 21 passes for 288 yards and a touchdown while running the ball nine times for 60 yards and two more touchdowns. The rest of the Packers backfield had just nine yards combined.

Throughout the game, fans were gushing over Willis' performance with many remarking that he might have played himself into a massive free agent contract and possibly even a starting job somewhere in 2026.

Sadly, Willis' heroic effort ended on a sour note. He suffered a shoulder injury in the fourth quarter which knocked him out of the game. Backup Clayton Tune came in but threw an interception on his first pass, which the Ravens then used to start a sustained drive that helped them seal the game.

Bad Timing

The game itself didn't matter to Green Bay other than playoff seeding and when Love returns he'll be the one leading the team's postseason push.

As for Willis, the injury might be costly to his own future if it's bad. He was already playing through the game with the shoulder slightly injured but decided to fight on.

If Willis is hurt, and it's a long injury, it could seriously damage his chances of getting a long-term deal with potential employers.

On the other hand, Willis has certainly proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that he can be a suitable backup to Jordan Love.

At worst, if other NFL teams don't show up at his door with bags of cash, the Packers would probably be willing to bring him back at a premium backup price.

Willis went to throw midway through the fourth quarter, but instantly dropped his arm and cried out in pain. He wasn’t hit on the play, but he took a few steps and dropped down briefly as the Packers' athletic training staff came out to help him.

Quickly, Willis stood up and ran off to the locker room. That paved the way for Clayton Tune to come in and replace him.

Tune, after scrambling for no gain on his first play, then threw a ball intended for Bo Melton that was intercepted by Marlon Humphrey deep in Ravens territory.

The team initially said that Willis was questionable to return with a right shoulder injury. Further specifics are not yet known. He came running back out from the locker room a few moments later, but the game was well out of reach by the time the Packers got the ball back. The Ravens killed most of the clock in his absence and rolled to the 17-point win, which kept their playoff hopes alive. Tune finished the game in the final seconds.

Willis got the start Saturday night in place of Jordan Love, who was ruled out with a concussion he suffered last week in Green Bay's loss to the Chicago Bears. Willis also injured his shoulder in that game, though he finished it out after replacing Love, and was considered questionable with the injury in the lead up to Saturday night.

Willis went 18-of-21 passing for 288 yards with a touchdown in the loss. He led the team on the ground with 60 yards and two touchdowns on nine carries, too. Christian Watson had 113 yards and a touchdown on five catches. The loss dropped Green Bay to 9-6-1, and handed the NFC North title officially to the Bears.

Tyler Huntley, who started in placed of an injured Lamar Jackson, went 16-of-20 passing for 107 yards with a touchdown. Derrick Henry had 216 yards and four touchdowns on 36 carries in a dominant outing.

But the Green Bay Packers have failed to overcome them in the last three games.

From losing star defensive end Micah Parsons to a season-ending ACL tear two weeks ago in Denver to quarterback Jordan Love missing the second half of the Chicago Bears game and the entire matchup with the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion, this team has had its share of bad luck with injuries, but they refuse to use it as an excuse.

“Guys going down all over the league, that ain’t just happening to us, you know what I mean?” Packers nickel back Javon Bullard said. “No matter how we put it, we’ve got to ball. We get paid to ball. We’ve got to go out there and execute. We’ve got to trust what the coaches are telling us. We’ve got to execute at a high level. We didn’t do that tonight. Injuries ain’t got (expletive) to do with it. Ravens played like they wanted to win and they did that.”

Here's an update on the Packers injury situation as they head into the final week of the regular season:

Jordan Love didn't clear concussion protocol

The Packers announced the day before kickoff of their Week 17 game against the Ravens that Love was downgraded from questionable to out, giving Malik Willis the nod to start. Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Love didn’t clear the concussion protocol to play.

“There’s a lot of tests you’ve got to pass,” LaFleur said. “Unfortunately, he just – I think he’s feeling physically good, but they have those measures in place obviously to protect our players, and he didn’t pass the necessary tests to clear the protocol.”

In addition to Love, starting right tackle Zach Tom (knee) missed his second straight game.

Willis, who was dealing with a shoulder injury he suffered in Chicago, exited the fourth quarter of the Ravens game, but LaFleur said he could’ve returned if necessary.

The Packers were shorthanded coming into the Ravens game and had several players drop out during the contest, but they'll be counting on their depth to contribute.

""When you come in, we expect you to play at the same standard that everybody else is playing – that Packers standard,"" Packers defensive end Lukas Van Ness said. ""Injuries are tough, but it's an unfortunate part of the game. We'll have to find ways for whether it's first, second or third string to rally and play up to the standard, because we're going to need everybody going into the postseason and this last game.""

In-game injuries pile up vs. Ravens

Zayne Anderson

A backup safety and key member of the special teams, Zayne Anderson limped off the field after a first-half kickoff return and was carted back to the locker room. He was ruled out the rest of the game with an ankle injury.

Jordon Riley

The Packers were already thin on the defensive line and missed productivity from Parsons and Devonte Wyatt when they lost another defensive tackle. Jordon Riley was ruled out with an Achilles injury during the game. Riley joined the Packers earlier this month off the New York Giants’ practice squad. He had two solo tackles in four games played.

Nate Hobbs

Packers cornerback Nate Hobbs has had knee injuries throughout his debut season in Green Bay and suffered another setback against the Ravens. Coming off one of his best performances last week against the Bears, Hobbs left the second quarter of the Ravens game due to a knee injury. It happened when Hobbs collided with Ravens receiver Zay Flowers in the end zone.

Dontayvion Wicks

Wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks missed the second half after being evaluated for a concussion.

Kamal Hadden

Backup cornerback Kamal Hadden had a tough break. Getting some snaps in place of Carrington Valentine, Hadden suffered an ankle injury while being part of a tackle on Derrick Henry. He was carted off the field. LaFleur said he had no updates on injuries, but did say Hadden’s ""didn’t look good.""

“I feel terrible for him,” LaFleur said. “It’s one of those unfortunate things that happens in football.”

LaFleur says it's too early for decision on playing Jordan Love in Minnesota

When the Detroit Lions lost to the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas, the Packers clinched a playoff spot.

The team now will have to decide if they want to play starters for the regular-season finale in Minnesota or rest guys before the wild-card playoff round.

When it comes to Love playing next week, LaFleur is taking it day by day.

“I don’t want to speak too soon on that,” LaFleur said on Love’s availability. “We just want to get him through the protocol and then we’ll have a decision to make.”","https://www.packersnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/28/PAPN/87932305007-apc-packers-vs-ravens-50713-122725-wag.jpg?crop=2997,1686,x0,y37&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-28 12:59:22.784300

Quarterback Clayton Tune, who had been elevated from the practice squad on Saturday, came into the game and preceded to throw an interception two plays later, which essentially sealed the game.

Willis was one of many Packers players who left the game injured.

Carolina Panthers @ Green Bay Packers

The Packers had two turnovers in this game, a Savion Williams fumble on the 15-yard line on the team’s opening drive of the game and a Jordan Love interception. Between those two drives, the Packers attempted three field goals and hit two of them.

In the fourth quarter, though, Green Bay turned it over on downs on the 13-yard line. They responded on the next drive by scoring their lone touchdown of the day, giving them a 13-13 tied score, before the Panthers drove 40 yards to kick the game-winning field goal as time expired.

Green Bay Packers @ Chicago Bears

The only true turnover of this game was Josh Jacobs’ fumble near the goal line. With that being said, the Packers were particularly bad in the red zone in this game, as they went into the red zone five times but never came away with a touchdown.

Green Bay turned the ball over on downs on the first drive of the game and the lone drive in overtime. They also allowed the clock to expire in both the first and second halves of the game.

The defeat marked the end of an era for the Bills, who had dominated the AFC for years.

Dec. 28, 1996 - Jaguars 30, Bills 27

One of my most indelible moments that occurred at One Bills Drive actually did not take place inside the stadium, but over at the adjacent fieldhouse where 36-year-old Jim Kelly announced his retirement on Jan. 31, 1997.

It was a massive event with hundreds of people in attendance, all of the Buffalo TV stations as well as ESPN interrupting their morning programming and broadcasting live, just as they’d done back in August 1986 when Kelly first arrived in Buffalo.

There were plenty of teary eyes that day as the best quarterback to ever play for the Bills -- at least before Josh Allen came along -- bid farewell.

""To leave and not be a part of this football team is something that will be very difficult to swallow, but I also know in my stomach and in my heart, it's time for Jim Kelly to move on,"" Kelly said, pausing occasionally as the weight of the words overcame him.

And one of the deciding factors for Kelly had happened a little more than a month earlier when the Bills were upset by the two-year-old Jacksonville Jaguars in an AFC wild-card game, a 30-27 defeat that was the first postseason loss in the history of the stadium.

That day the upstart Jaguars -- coached by Waterloo native Tom Coughlin -- stunned NFL nation as Natrone Means ran for 175 yards and a touchdown, Mark Brunell threw for 239 yards and a TD, and the Jacksonville defense knocked Kelly out of the game with a concussion midway through the fourth quarter.

On that play, with the score tied at 27 and the Bills at midfield, Kelly got drilled by safety Chris Hudson and lost a fumble that Hudson also recovered at the Jaguars 42. Eight plays later, with 3:07 left to play, Mike Hollis kicked a 45-yard go-ahead field goal. With Todd Collins forced into action as Kelly was being carted into the locker room, the Bills were done.

I’ll never forget the silence that enveloped the stadium that day as more than 70,000 fans could not believe that a Jaguars team that had just entered the NFL as an expansion franchise in 1995 had beaten Buffalo.

But in reality you could see it coming as the Bills were a team that had started to age and had finished 10-6 and in second place in the AFC East. And Kelly, ravaged for so many years by injuries, was clearly in decline as his 73.2 passer rating was the lowest of his career; he threw just 14 touchdowns compared to 19 interceptions.

Center Kent Hull, who announced his retirement almost immediately after the game, put it into perfect perspective as he always did when he said of the young and hungry Jaguars, “They seemed like the team that we used to be. They were an opportunistic team that made plays when they had to have them and that’s the reason they won.”

In that locker room, you could sense the Bills knew their glory years -- six AFC East titles, four AFC championships between 1988-95 -- were behind them. Thurman Thomas sat at his locker silent and dazed for about 10 minutes after the media was allowed in.

Linebacker David White said, “It’s a shock.”

Yeah, it was.

Everything seemed fine early as the Bills opened a 14-7 lead on a pair of Thomas TDs, one on a pass from Kelly, the other a short run. But the Jaguars were even at 17 by halftime, and still even at 20 late in the third quarter when the play that felt like it would finally turn the game in Buffalo’s favor happened.

White tipped a Brunell pass that Jeff Burris intercepted on the second play of the fourth quarter and returned 38 yards for a touchdown.

Said Hull: “The trait of this team in the past is that when we had to make a play, someone always found a way to make one. I thought that play was the interception for the touchdown.”

Instead, Jacksonville put together a 65-yard drive that was extended by a Means fourth-down run and was capped by Brunell’s tying two-yard TD pass to Jimmy Smith.

Barely a minute later, Kelly was down on the field, the Jaguars were celebrating a fumble recovery and you knew it was slipping away from the Bills.

With an expiring contract, Kelly’s future in Buffalo with the franchise he essentially saved and drove to unprecedented heights was already in doubt, but the concussion seemed to bring clarity to both him and the organization. This was certainly not the way a future Hall of Famer’s career should have ended, but sometimes you can’t go out on your own terms.

Eleven years, 35,467 passing yards, 237 touchdown passes, eight playoff seasons, four Super Bowls and countless thrills along the way, it was quite a ride for Kelly.

""This is going to be one tough act to follow,"" Marv Levy said. Sure was as it took Buffalo more than 20 years to find Kelly’s rightful successor in Allen.

Garrett broke his previous career high and franchise single-season record of 16 (2021 and 2022) in November.","The Athletic has live coverage of NFL Week 17 action.

Myles Garrett resumes his quest to break the NFL’s single-season sacks record Sunday when the Cleveland Browns host the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Garrett has 22 sacks on the season and stands a half-sack short of the record shared by Michael Strahan and the Steelers’ T.J. Watt, who won’t play Sunday due to injury.

With a half-sack last week versus Buffalo, Garrett became just the sixth player to reach 22 in a season. On Sunday, Garrett will try to break the record while recording his first career sack against a player with whom he’ll almost certainly one day share space in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

“(Rodgers) is legendary himself, and it’s a legendary record I’m here chasing,” Garrett said. “That’d be a great one to put a picture on the wall with.”

Garrett has not sacked Rodgers in two previous games, one earlier this season and one in 2021 when Rodgers was with Green Bay. But Garrett has recorded at least a half-sack in every game after the first Cleveland-Pittsburgh meeting, in Week 6. Sunday brings Garrett a chance to break the single-season record in his home stadium.

Earlier this season, Garrett passed Lawrence Taylor to become the first player with at least 12 sacks in six consecutive seasons. With 124 1/2 sacks in 132 games, Garrett holds the NFL record for most sacks recorded before a player’s 30th birthday. Reggie White was the record-holder at 108. Only White (137) had more sacks in his first nine seasons.

“That is something that I had in my mind coming into the league, being talked about among those greats,” Garrett said. “So, I just want to continue to just put myself into that conversation.”

Garrett, who turns 30 on Monday, has totaled five sacks in the Steelers’ last two visits to Cleveland, both Browns victories.

“We understand the gravity of what we’re going into and how they engineer victory and who’s significant in doing so,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said last week. “(Garrett) is at the doorstep of history, and so we certainly have respect for that.”

Garrett is a four-time first-team All-Pro and was the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year, but he’s never won a sack title. With two games remaining, he’s seven sacks clear of the nearest pursuer, the New York Giants’ Brian Burns (15). Garrett broke his previous career high and franchise single-season record of 16 (2021 and 2022) in November.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/27165940/GettyImages-2253013843-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-28 09:58:21.437718

Hollins, 6-foot-4, 221 pounds, was coming off a seven-catch, 69-yard performance in last Sunday's win over the Baltimore Ravens that clinched a playoff berth for New England (12-3).
This season, Hollins has played 68% of the Patriots' offensive snaps, which is more than any receiver.
They also elevated defensive tackle Leonard Taylor III and cornerback Kobee Minor from the practice squad for Sunday's game.
Henderson is listed as questionable, and he made the trip with the team for Sunday's game.","FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- New England Patriots wide receiver Mack Hollins, who started 13 games and was third on the team in receptions (46) and receiving yards (550), was placed on injured reserve Saturday, the team announced.

Hollins hadn't practiced all week after landing on the injury report because of his abdomen. Hollins, 6-foot-4, 221 pounds, was coming off a seven-catch, 69-yard performance in last Sunday's win over the Baltimore Ravens that clinched a playoff berth for New England (12-3). He presumably was injured in the game at some point, although he didn't leave the game early and played 49 of a possible 74 snaps.

This season, Hollins has played 68% of the Patriots' offensive snaps, which is more than any receiver. His size and catch radius (especially on deep crossing routes) have helped quarterback Drake Maye complete a league-leading 70.9% of his passes (minimum 150 attempts). The Patriots also relied on Hollins to bring a physical edge in the running game.

On Friday, coach Mike Vrabel lauded the 32-year-old Hollins, who has generated headlines for his preference to arrive to games barefoot, for his team-first approach.

""He has an energy to him,"" Vrabel said. ""And seeing him on Sunday night with the passion he had to help us win; we'll obviously miss him. I've always appreciated his willingness to learn what we're doing but also be a leader for some of the younger guys.""

The Patriots don't have another receiver on their roster with Hollins' physical makeup. Veteran receiver Stefon Diggs leads the team with 76 catches for 869 yards. Third-year players Kayshon Boutte (inactive Sunday because of a concussion) and DeMario Douglas and rookies Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III round out the receiver depth chart.

Hollins must miss at least four games, which means he wouldn't be eligible to play until deep in the postseason, if at all. The Patriots visit the New York Jets on Sunday, then finish the regular season at home against the Miami Dolphins.

If the Patriots win their final two games, and the Denver Broncos lose their season finale at home against the Los Angeles Chargers, New England would earn the AFC's No. 1 seed.

The Patriots signed defensive tackle Jeremiah Pharms Jr. from the practice squad to the 53-man roster to fill Hollins' place on the roster. They also elevated defensive tackle Leonard Taylor III and cornerback Kobee Minor from the practice squad for Sunday's game.

In a related note, rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson has been cleared from the concussion protocol, the Patriots announced. Henderson is listed as questionable, and he made the trip with the team for Sunday's game. The Patriots didn't elevate a running back from the practice squad, a move that seems to indicate Henderson will return to action Sunday.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1227%2Fr1594156_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 08:57:58.390214

Booker flew into the backfield and drilled Love directly in the helmet as he brought him down for a sack in the second quarter of that contest at Soldier Field. He was immediately penalized for the hit.

Love remained down after the hit and eventually walked off into the blue medical tent. He didn't return, and was replaced by Malik Willis. Love is still in concussion protocol and has been ruled out of Saturday night’s game against the Baltimore Ravens.

[Get more Bears news: Chicago team feed]

Willis went 9-of-11 for 121 yards with a touchdown in Love’s absence against the Bears, though Chicago rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to grab the win in overtime. That extended the Bears' lead in the NFC North. They’ll win the division if the Ravens beat the Packers on Saturday night, which will secure the team’s first division title since 2018.

The Packers, who will wrap up the season with the Minnesota Vikings next week, can still win the NFC North. They'll have to be perfect the rest of the way, however, and the Bears will have to lose out.

Booker has 29 total tackles and 2.5 sacks so far this season, both of which are career highs for the 23-year-old. The Bears selected him in the fifth round of the 2024 NFL Draft out of Kansas.

The Bears will take on the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night. They'll enter that contest with an 11-4 record and an outside shot at securing the No. 1 seed in the NFC.

But the Raiders did for Crosby, their best defensive player, what they did for Bowers, their best offensive player, who didn't need surgery on his bruised knee.","Las Vegas Raiders star Maxx Crosby is expected to need knee surgery that would sideline him into the offseason, league sources told ESPN.

The Raiders are placing Crosby on injured reserve to begin the process of getting him healthy for 2026.

Crosby was shut down during a week in which the Raiders already placed Pro Bowl tight end Brock Bowers on injured reserve -- and the same week Las Vegas plays the New York Giants in a game that could decide who gets the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL draft.

Some around the league speculated that competitive balance could be the impetus for these decisions, but the Raiders have stated that the moves are rooted solely in medical purposes.

""We have made the decision to place Maxx Crosby on the Reserve/Injured list for the remainder of the 2025 season,"" the team said in a statement Saturday. ""After deliberate and thorough consultation with multiple top medical professionals, it became clear that this decision is in the best interest of both the franchise and the player. Maxx is the ultimate warrior, and he has fought extremely hard to compete each week with his teammates since injuring his knee mid-season. We are grateful for his extraordinary contributions. He is a true Raider on and off the field -- we look forward to his leadership and toughness into 2026 and beyond.""

Crosby initially injured his left knee Oct. 19 at Kansas City and has rarely participated in a full week of practice since. On Tuesday, Crosby underwent an additional MRI that revealed the injury had persisted and could present long-term concerns should it not be addressed.

The Raiders shared those concerns with Crosby on Tuesday, along with the belief that the potential long-term risk was not prudent.

""Each week, he has done everything you could possibly imagine a guy could do to play, and he's been able to,"" Raiders coach Pete Carroll said Friday. ""But after an evaluation we did Monday or Tuesday, whenever it was, it just looks too bad.""

Crosby wanted to finish out the season because it is what makes him the high-energy, high-performance player that he is. When the Raiders overruled him, Crosby went home Friday, disappointed and upset, but Carroll told reporters that he and Crosby had spoken ""four times"" that day.

""He knows that he's banged up, so he's talking about, 'I'd like to get out of here.' And I said, 'Yeah, get out of here.' So he took off,"" Carroll said. ""... This didn't just spring on him. We've been talking about it, and it was exactly what you would think he would do and he should do. I agree with him 1,000 percent on how he responded, and I [would have] responded the same way.""

This marks the second straight year that Crosby did not finish the season -- last year he suffered a high ankle sprain that required surgery -- and Crosby does not like missing time.

But the Raiders did for Crosby, their best defensive player, what they did for Bowers, their best offensive player, who didn't need surgery on his bruised knee. Bowers has been playing with a PCL injury and bone bruise in his left knee since Week 1.

There are no plans for the Raiders to shut down any other players; the rest are healthy enough to play and are expected to do so Sunday against the Giants. Quarterback Geno Smith, running back Ashton Jeanty and wide receiver Tre Tucker will play Sunday, according to sources, as the Raiders play in a game that -- even if they don't want to admit it -- would be winning for losing.

The loser of the Giants-Raiders game will have the inside track on the No. 1 pick in next year's draft. The winner will be thrust into the mix of a group of teams with three wins and could fall out of the top five picks.

When Crosby was asked earlier in the week about the Raiders potentially securing the top pick in the draft, he said, ""I don't give a s--- about the pick. I don't play for that.

""My job is to be the best defensive end in the world, and that's what I focus on every day, and being a great leader and being an influence,"" Crosby said. ""That's [the front office's] job. But that's got nothing to do with me.""

The Raiders felt it was most important to protect their two greatest contributors, Crosby and Bowers, leading them to make the decisions they did.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0414%2Fr1478704_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 06:57:39.265314

Packers injuries in 2025 The Packers' Week 17 game was the latest in a never-ending string of injuries throughout the 2025 season.","Jordon Riley joined the Green Bay Packers this month hoping to provide size up front for a depleted defensive line missing several key players to injury.

Riley is now joining those players on the injured list and his season is likely over.

He departed Saturday's 41-24 loss to the Baltimore Ravens early in the second quarter after going down with an Achilles injury. The 338-pound Riley needed assistance in getting to his feet and onto a cart.

Riley, 27, was then taken to the locker room and the Packers ruled him out.

The injury came as Derrick Henry ran in for his second rushing touchdown of the game to put the Ravens ahead 14-7.

The Packers signed Riley off the New York Giants' practice squad on Dec. 3 less than a week after defensive lineman Devonte Wyatt suffered a season-ending ankle injury in a win over the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving.

The defensive line would suffer its biggest blow as week later with the loss of All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, who tore his ACL against the Denver Broncos on Dec. 14.

It's also the second straight week that the Packers have lost a player to an Achilles injury. Tight end John FitzPatrick suffered a torn Achilles in the team's 22-16 loss to the Chicago Bears.

Riley would be one of many Packers players who departed Saturday's game with an injury, including cornerbacks Nate Hobbs and Kamal Hadden, safety Zayne Anderson, wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks and finally quarterback Malik Willis.

Related: 49ers Announce George Kittle Injury Update After Leaving Colts Game","George Kittle is in serious doubt of missing the San Francisco 49ers’ Week 17 matchup against the Chicago Bears on Sunday. The two-time All-Pro tight end is currently dealing with an ankle injury, which he sustained in Monday’s 48-27 win over the Indianapolis Colts.

Kittle was forced to exit the game in the third quarter and was unable to return. After the win, the seven-time Pro Bowler claimed that it was a hip-drop tackle in the second quarter that caused his injury. The league has now reviewed the incidents from the 49ers-Colts game and has decided not to issue any fines against Indianapolis.

After being diagnosed with a low-to-mid-grade left ankle sprain, Kittle was forced to sit out all three practice sessions this week. He has officially been listed as questionable to play on Sunday against the Bears.

Kittle did not name any names when he stated after the Colts game that he was illegally taken down by a hip-drop tackle, which is defined in the NFL rule book as a defensive player grabbing “the runner with one or both hands or wraps the runner with both arms and unweights himself by swiveling and dropping his hips and/or lower body, landing on and/or trapping the runner’s leg(s) at or below the knee.”

The NFL Officiating Department reviews every play from every game. They looked at the tackles from the 49ers-Colts contest, but did not see any violations from Indianapolis, despite Kittle’s claim.

The league announced on Saturday via the gameday accountability report that no Colts player was fined for the Niners game. For context, hip-drop tackles are eligible for a fine of $17,389 for a first offense and $23,186 for a second.

While this is a positive development for the Colts, the bad news is that they have now officially been eliminated from playoff contention. The Houston Texans defeated the Los Angeles Chargers on Saturday, 20-16, resulting in Indianapolis losing its chance to secure a postseason berth.

As for Kittle, his status for the Bears game will likely be decided closer to kickoff. The Niners will host Chicago on Sunday, with the game scheduled to start at 8:20 p.m. from Levi’s Stadium.

Key offensive weapons such as Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson and 49ers tight end George Kittle are trying to play through injury. Defensive stalwarts such as the Eagles' Jalen Carter and the Colts' Sauce Gardner will make their returns.

Here's who's in and who's out in Week 17.

QB Josh Allen (Bills)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Full

Injury: Foot

Kickoff: 4:25 p.m. ET

Allen will play in the Bills' Week 17 game against the Eagles. He sustained a foot injury in Buffalo's win over the Browns last week, but won't miss any time. With their superstar quarterback in the lineup, the Bills (11-4) will look to close the gap on the Patriots (12-3) in the AFC East.

RB TreVeyon Henderson (Patriots)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Full

Injury: Concussion

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Henderson sustained a concussion in the Patriots' Week 16 win over the Ravens on Sunday night. He missed the remainder of that game after getting hurt, but won't miss any more time as he progressed through the NFL's protocol, and was cleared to play. The Patriots can clinch the AFC East with a victory over the Jets and Bills loss to the Eagles.

WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (Cardinals)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Heel

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Harrison will play in the Cardinals' Week 17 game against the Bengals. He returned to the lineup last week after missing two games with a heel injury, but he's seemingly still hampered by it as he practiced in limited fashion throughout the week.

TE Harold Fannin Jr. (Browns)

Practice schedule: Full-Full-Limited

Injury: Groin

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Fannin plans to play in the Browns' Week 17 game against the Steelers after sustaining a groin injury during Friday's practice. It's unfortunate timing for the tight end who broke the franchise record for most receptions by a rookie in Week 16. He has 70 catches for 710 yards and five touchdowns in his first NFL season. He'll tough it out on Sunday.

DL Jalen Carter (Eagles)

Practice schedule: Full-Full-Full

Injury: Shoulder

Kickoff: 4:25 p.m. ET

Carter will return to the lineup for the Eagles' Week 17 game against the Bills. He's missed the last three games with a shoulder injury, and in that time, Philadelphia went 1-2. With their star defensive lineman back in the lineup, the Eagles will look to push for the NFC's two-seed with a win over the Bills. The Eagles also need a loss from the Bears in their game against the 49ers. Having Carter back will certainly help them achieve that first step.

CB Sauce Gardner (Colts)

Practice schedule: DNP-Limited-Full

Injury: Calf

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Gardner will play for in the Colts' Week 17 game against the Jaguars. He sustained a calf injury in Week 13, and missed three games, two of which Indianapolis has lost. The Colts traded two future first-round draft picks for Gardner at the NFL's trade deadline, and now he can help them make one last push for the playoffs. Indianapolis needs to beat Jacksonville, and the Chargers need to beat the Texans to keep its playoff hopes alive.

DL DeForest Buckner (Colts)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Neck

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

DeForest Buckner will miss the Colts' Week 17 game against the Jaguars, and will miss the remainder of the season after being placed on injured reserve. Buckner was out five games with this same neck injury, and returned for Week 16 and reaggravated it. So while the Colts will get Gardner back in a must-win game, they'll lose their best defensive lineman, in Buckner.

TE George Kittle (49ers)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Ankle

Kickoff: 8:20 p.m. ET

Kittle will be a game-time decision for the 49ers' game against the Bears on Sunday night. He sustained an ankle injury in the 49ers' Monday night game against the Colts last week. While San Francisco has clinched a playoff spot, it can still earn the top-seed in the NFC if it wins its final two games against the Bears and the Seahawks. Therefore, Kittle may push to play, and help his team earn a week off down the line.

WR Luther Burden III (Bears)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limted-Full

Injury: Ankle

Kickoff: 8:20 p.m. ET

Burden will play in the Bears' game against the 49ers on Sunday night. The rookie wide receiver missed their game against the Packers last week with an ankle injury he sustained in Week 15. Now that he's back, he'll play a major role as lead pass-catcher Rome Odunze will miss his fourth straight game.",https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2025/12/1408/814/jalen_carter_horizontal.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-12-28 02:58:14.634483

The signal caller turned down entering the 2025 NFL Draft last year to return to Baton Rouge to continue his pursuit of leading the Tigers back to the national championship game. That did not happen as he's played through injury most of the season and LSU (7-5) will meet Houston (9-3) in the Texas Bowl inside NRG Stadium Saturday night (8:15 p.m. CT, ESPN).

Due to an abdominal strain that he initially suffered during preseason practice back in August, Nussmeier missed the final three regular season games for the Tigers. In the last game he played in at Alabama, Nussmeier was benched in the third quarter for sophomore backup Michael Van Buren, who has started in his place since reaggravating the abdominal injury ahead of the Arkansas game.

In nine-plus games, Nussmeier has thrown for 1,927 yards, 12 touchdowns and five interceptions in 2025. The LSU quarterback's numbers are a far cry from his performance as a first-time start his junior year when he put up more than 4,000 passing yards and 29 touchdowns in 2024.

Is Garrett Nussmeier playing today?

Nussmeier will not play against Houston in the Texas Bowl today. Interim LSU coach Frank Wilson told reporters multiple weeks before the game that Nussmeier had already been ruled out for the contest.

Missing the Texas Bowl will allow Nussmeier a jumpstart in getting ready for the NFL Draft process, which officially kicks off early 2026.

The 27-year-old quarterback was ruled out for the game due to a concussion, which he sustained in the Packers’ 22-16 overtime loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday.

Love, who went 8 of 13 passing for 77 yards before his early exit, suffered the head injury when he took a hit from Chicago defensive end Austin Booker. Initially after the second quarter incident, Love's return was questionable. Eventually he was ruled out for the remainder of the contest.

Booker's helmet-to-helmet hit temporarily produced a 7-yard loss, but the play was nullified by the personal foul penalty assessed to the defensive end. The Packers QB was down on the ground for a while before slowly getting to his feet and being assisted off the field. Booker was flagged for unnecessary roughness, resulting in a 15-yard penalty against the Bears.

The NFL has reviewed the incident and reached a decision on Booker’s actions. The league announced on Saturday via the game day accountability report that the Chicago DE had been fined $5,818 for a hit on the quarterback. Booker’s tackle was deemed excessive by the NFL officiating department, and he has been punished for a blow to the head/neck.

This is Booker’s second fine this season. In November, the second-year player was fined $5,818 for impermissible use of the helmet against the New York Giants.

As for Love, the Packers star was limited at practice throughout the week. There was hope he would be able to suit up on Saturday against Baltimore, but the nature of his injury forced Green Bay to sit him instead.

Love’s next chance to play will be in Week 18 against the Minnesota Vikings. The Bears, on the other hand, are in action on Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers. Both the Packers and the Bears have clinched playoff berths.

Across the league, a bigger question keeps surfacing: Why are today’s best-conditioned athletes still getting hurt?

NFL's injury era: Why are so many players getting hurt?

“It was a freak accident … non-contact. My knee just caved in and just tore my ACL,” said Derrek Bunkleman, a Drake University linebacker and De Pere High School alumnus.

Before his college football career even began, Bunkleman tore his ACL while still at De Pere High School.

“I was devastated,” Bunkleman said. “I was like, ‘How am I gonna come back from this?’”

In today’s professional athletes, experts say, we don’t have a toughness problem... It’s a physics problem.

“We’ve put our emphasis on faster, quicker, more powerful,” said Scotty Smith, Performance Coach and Owner of Synergy Sports Performance in Green Bay. “But how do we control those things? So I’ve always used that explanation of like we put the bigger engine in a nice car, but we don’t address the tires and the brakes.”

And when that car has to stop, something has to give.

As athletes get bigger and faster, non-contact injuries have become more common, according to the National Academy of Sports Medicine.

“In a non-contact ACL injury, the foot is planted, there’s no contact,” said Dr. Abbey DeBruin, an orthopedic surgeon at OSMS Green Bay. “The tibia shifts forward on the femur. That pivoting motion puts strain on the ACL. In some cases, the force and the strain overcome what the ACL is able to endure, and that’s when an ACL rupture can happen.”

That’s why experts say injury prevention today is more than just fixing what’s broken. It’s about managing workload and recovery.

“These guys aren’t getting the one-on-one attention you think that they are,” Smith said. “There’s just not enough people to go around.”

And even when injuries are repaired, timing matters.

“With an ACL reconstruction, the graft somewhere around the three to four month mark is probably actually at its weakest point,” Dr. DeBruin said.

Athletes are starting to feel a lot better and want to potentially be more involved in sport, but the graft is at a more vulnerable point for re-rupture. Dr. DeBruin says that oftentimes it’s 9 months or more before athletes are recovered enough to return to peak performance.

As the NFL looks for its next edge, Dr. DeBruin and Smith say the teams that rethink how they protect their athletes may shape the future of the game.

“We grew up in this world that we think more is better,” Smith said. “And I’m always under the assumption that more isn’t better. Better is better.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7643552/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2918x1532+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2F9d%2F0451387149e996bdb300dfce74be%2Fap25348858864919.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 22:57:54.547750

The Patriots' resurgence in coach Mike Vrabel's first season at the helm comes thanks to improvement on both sides of the ball. New England's defense was well below average in 2024; a year later, it's a top-10 unit by yards and points allowed.

New England's offense took a bigger jump under Vrabel and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. Second-year quarterback Drake Maye's led that side of the ball from one of the worst in the league to a top-10 unit as well.

Maye's top weapon this year has been rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson. New England selected Henderson in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft and he's grown into a big role in the offense.

Henderson leads the team in scrimmage yards (997) and touchdowns (eight) this season. He left New England's Week 16 game against the Baltimore Ravens during the second quarter with a concussion.

Will Henderson be back for the Patriots' Week 17 matchup against the New York Jets? Here's what we know:

Is TreVeyon Henderson playing this week?

Henderson cleared concussion protocol and is expected to play against the Jets this week, per multiple reports.

Henderson was a full-go in practice on Friday, per the team's injury report.

New England's used a mixture of Henderson and veteran Rhamondre Stevenson out of the backfield this season. Henderson holds the edge in carries (148 to Stevenson's 115), rushing yards (776 to 425) and rushing touchdowns (seven to four). After practicing fully, that's a good sign he'll be the top runner once again.

The Baltimore Ravens have a massive problem with quarterback Lamar Jackson ahead of the Week 17 game against the Green Bay Packers.

Jackson suffered a back injury in the Week 16 loss to the New England Patriots that forced his early exit from the contest and led to his being on the injury report this week.

After not practicing at all during the week, Jackson drew the dreaded doubtful tag on Thursday, which is terrible news for his chances of suiting up.

Here's what we know about Jackson's status for Week 17.

Is Lamar Jackson playing tonight?

UPDATE: Jackson is officially INACTIVE for Week 17.

No, Jackson is not expected to play on Saturday against the Packers.

Players rarely play through the doubtful tag, so while the light is still on for the Ravens quarterback just in case, he's highly unlikely to suit up.

Advertisement

The last time we saw a player be active despite the doubtful tag was Las Vegas Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby, who played in Week 12 of the 2023 season against the Kansas City Chiefs after being listed with the designation.

We'll get final confirmation on Jackson's status an hour and a half before the 8 p.m. ET kickoff on Saturday, when the Ravens and Packers drop their lists of inactives.

Barring Jackson pulling off a rare feat, the Ravens' playoff hopes are riding on the arm of backup quarterback Tyler Huntley, who won his only start this season, which came in Week 8 against the Chicago Bears.

Huntley completed 17-of-22 passes for 186 yards and one touchdown while adding eight carries for 53 yards in the victory over the Bears. In all, Huntley is 6-9 as a starter during his career.

Advertisement

Upon replacing an injured Jackson last week, Huntley completed 9-of-10 passes for 65 yards in the 28-24 loss. The Ravens actually had a two-score lead in the fourth quarter of that game before a total collapse on both sides of the ball.

While Huntley is an obvious downgrade from Jackson, it's not impossible to think the Ravens can win another game with him under center.

Increasing their chances is the fact that the Packers won't have starter Jordan Love under center, as he has been ruled out for the contest. However, backup signal-caller Malik Willis is very capable of leading Green Bay to a win.

Baltimore enters this contest in a do-or-die situation.

If the Ravens lose, they will be eliminated from playoff contention, sending the team into an offseason with a ton of uncertainty. If the Ravens win, they will need the Pittsburgh Steelers to lose on Sunday to the Cleveland Browns to stay alive.

Here's what to know about Lamar Jackson's status for the Ravens' Week 17 game and beyond as they look to remain in the 2025 AFC playoff race.

Is Lamar Jackson playing today?

Jackson is officially inactive for Saturday's game against the Packers. The Ravens had initially designated him as ""doubtful"" to play on the team's final injury report for Week 17.

While Jackson wasn't immediately ruled out for the contest, the two-time MVP was unable to practice in the lead-up to Saturday's game. That set the expectation Huntley would start in his place.

Lamar Jackson injury update

Jackson is dealing with a back injury he suffered midway through his team's Week 16 loss to the New England Patriots.

Jackson wasn't able to return to the ""Sunday Night Football"" game after being kneed in the back while sliding to the ground after a 3-yard gain. Huntley finished the second half and Ravens coach John Harbaugh later told reporters Jackson had suffered a serious back contusion.

Harbaugh provided updates about Jackson's Week 17 status throughout the week. He told reporters Dec. 24 it was ""undetermined"" whether Jackson would play against the Packers and that the team would evaluate Jackson throughout the week before determining his status.

""He could play without that practice for sure,"" Harbaugh said of Jackson. ""He's played a lot of football, won a lot of games for us. If he's ready to go, he will go. If he can go, he will go. You can bet on that.""

But ultimately, Jackson wasn't able to practice because of the back injury and was slapped with the ""doubtful"" designation for Saturday's game. He was then declared inactive for the contest 90 minutes before it began.

Who is the Ravens' backup QB?

Tyler Huntley is the Ravens' backup. The 27-year-old is expected to start in place of Jackson against the Packers in what would be his second start of the 2025 campaign.

Huntley has completed 76.6% of his passes for 319 yards and one touchdown in his limited action with the Ravens this season. He helped lead the Ravens to a 30-16 win over the Chicago Bears in Week 8 in his lone start but has a career record of 6-9 in 15 starts.

Huntley has completed 65.7% of his career passes for 3,105 yards, 12 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.

Ravens QB depth chart

The Ravens have three quarterbacks on their 53-man roster. They are:

Lamar Jackson (injured)

Tyler Huntley

Cooper Rush

Rush started the 2025 NFL season as the Ravens' backup quarterback before being overtaken by Huntley. The 32-year-old struggled in two starts after replacing an injured Jackson earlier in the season, completing 65.4% of his passes for 303 yards and four interceptions.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/27/USAT/87929345007-lamar-jackson-ravens-122725.jpg?crop=4870,2739,x0,y15&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-27 20:00:15.634005

As the team announced on Saturday, the rookie running back has cleared the NFL’s concussion protocol and will play against the New York Jets on Sunday.

Henderson, 23, was one of three Patriots entering the protocol after sustaining a head injury last Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens. The second-round draft pick went down midway through the second quarter and subsequently had to exit the game.

Unlike wide receiver Kayshon Boutte and left guard Jared Wilson, Henderson was back at practice at the first possible opportunity. While still limited in his return, he was upgraded to full participation by Friday’s session and subsequently listed as questionable for the game against the Jets.

Since then, he passed the final examination conducted by an independent doctor and was given the green light to play on Sunday. This means that, unlike their first meeting Week 11, both Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson will suit up versus New York at the running back position. Stevenson had missed the previous game with a toe injury.

In his abence, Henderson finished with three total touchdowns in a 27-14 Patriots victory at Gillette Stadium. In total, the youngster has found the end zone a team-leading eight times this season while also gaining 997 yards from scrimmage.

In addition to the Henderson announcement, the Patriots also changed the status of fullback Jack Westover for Sunday’s game. Dealing with an illness, Westover is officially questionable.

The Bears’ defensive lineman has had a quiet stretch of games since the Week 12 game against the Minnesota Vikings.","The battle for the No. 1 seed in the NFC continues.

This Week 17 matchup between the Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers will feature two playoff teams with 11-4 records. Both can clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference if they win out and have the Seattle Seahawks (12-4) lose a game.

After the 49ers, the Bears will close out their regular season against the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field. The 49ers will host the Seahawks at Levi’s Stadium in Week 18.

That final game against the Lions won’t matter if the Bears don’t come away with a win against the 49ers on Sunday Night Football.

Here are the five players who will have a major influence on the Week 17 matchup in Santa Clara, CA.

BEARS LB Tremaine Edmunds

The Bears’ linebacker made his return against the Green Bay Packers after missing four games with a groin injury. In the 22-16 win over the Packers, Edmunds finished with six total tackles and recovered a fumble caused by Nashon Wright deep in the third quarter.

With how 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan runs his offense, Edmunds will have plenty to decipher, given the numerous presnap motions, shifts, and misdirections that occur on any given snap.

Edmunds needs to trust his eyes and instincts so he can play fast against a well-coached 49ers offense that hasn’t punted since the team’s Week 13 matchup against the Cleveland Browns on Nov. 30.

Bears DL Gervon Dexter Sr.

The Bears’ defensive lineman has had a quiet stretch of games since the Week 12 game against the Minnesota Vikings. Dexter has just one sack in the last six games and has five total on the season, which is tied for his career high.

However, Dexter does have 13 total quarterback pressures in his last four games, but he needs to find a way to turn those plays into sacks, especially against 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy.

According to Next Gen Stats, Purdy has an NFL-leading 130.0 passer rating on third downs this season. Dexter will have to prove he can help limit the 49ers’ production on first and second down to make those third-down situations tougher for Purdy to convert.

Bears WR Luther Burden III

After missing last week’s game against the Packers with an ankle injury, Burden is positioned to return for Sunday night’s game versus the 49ers. He was a full participant in Friday’s practice and had no injury designation.

[READ: Bears injury report: Luther Burden III will play 49ers, Rome Odunze remains out]

The Bears’ rookie wide receiver was the team’s leading receiver in the 31-3 win over the Cleveland Browns. He caught six passes on seven targets for 84 yards.

The 49ers have struggled to apply pressure all season, generating just 18 total sacks, which is last in the NFL. According to Next Gen Stats, the 49ers have three of the 10 defensive tackles with the lowest pressure rate generated this season (minimum 200 pass rushes) in Kalia Davis, Jordan Elliott and Alfred Collins.

With the 49ers’ inability to create consistent pressure, this should allow Caleb Williams to find receivers downfield, and Burden could be in for a big receiving day.

49ers RB Christian McCaffrey

This 49ers’ offense runs through McCaffrey, and that’s not an exaggeration.

The veteran running back leads the team in rushing and receiving. He has 280 carries for 1,039 yards and nine touchdowns, and has 92 receptions for 849 yards and seven touchdowns.

According to Next Gen Stats, McCaffrey leads the NFL with 372 touches, 43 more than any other player.

Shanahan will find different ways to get his best playmaker the ball, and it will take all 11 players on defense to help contain one of the NFL’s most versatile players.

49ers LB Dee Winters

The former sixth-round draft pick from TCU in 2023 is having a career season.

Winters leads the 49ers with 92 total tackles, which is 16 more than fellow linebacker Tatum Bethune.

The 25-year-old linebacker made arguably his biggest play of the season in the Monday night victory over the Indianapolis Colts in Week 16. The 49ers were up 41-27 late in the fourth quarter, and then Winters extended the lead after he intercepted Philip Rivers and returned the interception 74 yards for a pick-6 to help San Francisco win 48-27.

Bears head coach Ben Johnson praised defensive coordinator Robert Saleh for how hard his unit plays. Winters is a good example of that defensive mentality, and the Bears’ offense will have to keep tabs on him throughout the game.",https://dupvhm5r1oaxt.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-17-1024x576.png,N,,2025-12-27 21:13:02.840615

1 overall pick in the NFL draft since taking running back Tucker Frederickson out of Auburn in 1965.br/]","EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- There is a lot at stake on Sunday for two 2-13 teams when the New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders meet at Allegiant Stadium (4:05 p.m. ET, CBS). Namely, the pole position for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL draft.

The Giants and Raiders currently have a 37.6% and 36.2% chance, respectively, to land the coveted top pick, according to ESPN Analytics. The Giants would be comfortably in the driver's seat heading into Week 18's matchup with Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys if they lose in Las Vegas. Ditto the Raiders with the Kansas City Chiefs on the horizon for their finale.

New York's odds jump to 73% to get the top pick with a loss to the Raiders. They fall to 6% with a win. Conversely, the Raiders jump to 69% with a loss and less than 1% with a win.

This is all possible because the Giants and Raiders come in on nine-game losing streaks. It's the first time in NFL history that two teams with at least nine-game skids during a single season meet, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.

But clearly a lot is at stake for both teams aside from ending their losing streaks, even if those involved don't want to look at it that way.

""I mean, I really don't think we talk about that part too much about the draft positioning and wanting a certain pick or anything like that,"" Giants wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson said. ""I think we just want to go out there and play our best football and go out there and get a win.""

For the Giants, a win could mean preventing them from getting a significant haul in a trade for the top pick, presumably from a team that desperately needs a quarterback. Or they could just stay at No. 1 and selecta top-rated player without any hesitation or obstruction.

For the Raiders, a loss could mean having their choice at the top quarterback in this year's draft, whomever they decide that might be -- likely Indiana's Fernando Mendoza or Oregon's Dante Moore, should he declare for the draft. That could prove valuable with35-year-old starter (and former Giant) Geno Smith.

Either way, it's not hard to see why this game between two struggling teams is so valuable. So while the loser can technically be the winner, it's not something that Giants interim coach Mike Kafka has even mentioned to his team this week.

""I haven't talked about it with the players. The players want to win. The coaching staff wants to win this week,"" Kafka said. ""Like, this is our only focus is this week. And so, all our messaging, all that we're talking about is how we can get better, number one, as a team, and then what we have to do today to go out there to Vegas and beat the Raiders.""

Tell that to each team's fan base. The focus publicly is primarily on what this game means in terms of draft positioning.

The Giants ruled out left tackle Andrew Thomas on Friday with a hamstring injury and center John Michael Schmitz Jr. is doubtful with a finger problem that inhibits his ability to snap.

Las Vegas placed tight end Brock Bowers and safety Jeremy Chinn on injured reserve earlier this week. Bowers has been dealing with a knee injury for a good chunk of this season but finished Sunday's loss to the Houston Texans. Chinn also landed on IR after playing all 61 defensive snaps against the Houston Texans.

But don't tell Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby about positioning for any draft pick.

""Yeah, I don't give a s--- about the pick, to be honest. I don't play for that. That's not my job,"" Crosby said after the 23-21 loss to the Texans. ""My job is to be the best defensive end in the world. That's what I focus on every day. And being a great leader, being an influence, being that guy on a consistent basis for my team.

""That's their job, the front office, the coaches. They do that. But that has nothing to do with me. I've learned that lesson in the past. I'm not trying to ... you can't control everything. That's not my job description. My job is to be the best in the world at what I do. That is wrecking the game.""

The Raiders ultimately shut down Crosby, much to his chagrin. He was ruled out for Sunday because of a lingering knee problem that he wanted to play through.

Worrying about the draft is not Crosby's responsibility, yet it can also be fruitless.

The Giants played against Washington late in the 2019 season in what has famously been dubbed ""The Chase Young Bowl."" The loser of that game was supposed to have the prime position to draft former Ohio State standout Chase Young.

New York won behind five touchdown passes by Daniel Jones. The Commanders ended up taking Young second overall in that 2020 draft. The Giants, perhaps fortuitously, ended up with standout left tackle Andrew Thomas.

Unfortunately New York has been in this situation often in recent years.The Giants won in Week 17 last year against the Colts to take them out of the running for the No. 1 overall pick. The Tennessee Titans ultimately selected quarterback Cam Ward with the top pick while the Giants took edge rusher Abdul Carter third overall and had to trade back into the bottom half of the first round for quarterback Jaxson Dart.

The Giants also won three straight games late in the 2023 season with Tommy DeVito at quarterback to take them out of the running for quarterbacks Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels and Drake Maye. They were selected by Chicago, Washington and New England, respectively, while New York remained at No. 6 and landed star wide receiver Malik Nabers.

Crosby is expected to undergo knee surgery in the near future that will sideline him into the offseason, too, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Further specifics on that surgery, or a timeline for his return, are not yet known.

While the Raiders may want to not risk further injury for Crosby, they are also chasing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. In facing a fellow 2-13 team in the New York Giants on Sunday, a defeat would improve their chances and not having their best defensive player would aid in that pursuit.

According to the NFL, this will be only the third time in NFL history that two teams that are 11-plus games under .500 will meet and the first time since 1991.

The 27-year-old Crosby was vocal earlier this week about caring more about helping the Raiders win rather than about a first overall draft pick.

""Yeah, I don’t give a s*** about the pick, to be honest,"" Crosby said Tuesday. ""I don't play for that. That's not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world. That's what I focus on every day. Being a great leader, being an influence. Being that guy on a consistent basis for my team.""

After being informed that the Raiders weren't going to let him play against the Giants, Crosby told head coach Pete Carroll that he wanted to leave the facility.

""He knows that he's banged up, so he's talking about, 'I'd like to get out of here.' And I said, 'Yeah, get out of here.' So he took off,"" Carroll said on Friday, via ESPN. ""... This didn't just spring on him. We've been talking about it, and it was exactly what you would think he would do and he should do. I agree with him 1,000 percent on how he responded, and I [would have] responded the same way.""

Crosby has been in the NFL since 2019 and has played 110 regular-season games with the Raiders, but only one playoff game. The Raiders have only two playoff appearances — and zero playoff wins — since appearing in Super Bowl XXXVII at the end of the 2002 season.

Crosby won't be the only Raiders star who will miss out this weekend. Tight end Brock Bowers was placed on injured reserve Wednesday with a knee injury that limited him to 12 games this season.

Bowers, the Raiders 2024 first-round draft pick, was an All-Pro last season and has made two Pro Bowls in his first two NFL seasons.

Dart was miserable in Week 16 against Minnesota, but I expect him to bounce back in Week 17 at Las Vegas. Dart is once again worth using as a low-end starter in all leagues. The Vikings have dominated all their opposing quarterbacks since Week 9, so it was no surprise that Dart was miserable with 7-of-13 passing for 33 yards and an interception, and he only ran for 7 yards. This week, Dart should rebound against the Raiders, who have allowed seven quarterbacks to score at least 21.2 Fantasy points this season. And Dart is averaging 23.5 Fantasy points in five road games this year. It also helps that Maxx Crosby isn't expected to play for Las Vegas in Week 17.

Mayfield was shaky in Week 16 at Carolina with only 15.7 Fantasy points, and he has now scored fewer than 20 Fantasy points in five of his past six starts. But he should rebound in Week 17 at Miami, and the Dolphins have allowed three of their past four opposing quarterbacks to score at least 20.9 Fantasy points, including two in a row with Aaron Rodgers and Joe Burrow. Tampa Bay can win the NFC South with victories in the next two games against Miami and Carolina, and I expect Mayfield to step up this week against the Dolphins.

Shough is playing well coming into Week 17 at Tennessee with at least 19.1 Fantasy points in four games in a row and in five of his past six outings. He just had his first 300-yard game in Week 16 against the Jets (308), and he has two games in his past three outings with at least 32 rushing yards. This week, Shough is facing a Titans defense that has allowed four of the past five opposing quarterbacks to score at least 21.7 Fantasy points, and the only team below that total was Kansas City in Week 16 without Patrick Mahomes (knee). I like Shough as a low-end No. 1 Fantasy quarterback in all leagues.

TreVeyon Henderson (concussion) is expected to play in Week 17, but I still like Stevenson as at least a flex option in all leagues against the Jets. In their past six games, seven running backs have scored at least 13.5 PPR points against New York with nine rushing touchdowns and five receiving touchdowns. Stevenson missed the Week 11 game against the Jets due to a toe injury, but Henderson had 19 carries for 62 yards and two touchdowns and five catches for 31 yards and a touchdown on five targets. Stevenson just scored 17.8 PPR points in Week 16 at Baltimore in the game Henderson was injured. Even though Henderson should be considered a No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues, Stevenson still played more snaps than him in the two games prior to Week 16, which gives him a good chance to also be productive in this fantastic matchup.

Sampson (hand) will hopefully play in Week 17 against Pittsburgh after missing the past two games, and he could have a prominent role with Quinshon Judkins (ankle) out. We'll see how Cleveland uses Sampson, Raheim Sanders and Trayveon Williams, but Sampson has the most upside of this group. He played Week 1 without Judkins, and Sampson had 12 carries for 29 yards and eight catches for 64 yards on eight targets. His role in the passing game is what we like, and Shedeur Sanders likes throwing to his running backs. In five starts, Sanders has targeted his running backs 38 times for 31 catches, 297 yards and one touchdown. That reception total for running backs is third in the NFL over that span. Sampson is a high-end flex in PPR in this game.

Thomas also has 15 catches for 312 yards and a touchdown on 25 targets in three career games against Indianapolis. All three Jaguars receivers are worth a look in this matchup, and I like Jakobi Meyers as a low-end No. 2 Fantasy receiver, with Parker Washington as a high-end No. 3 option. Thomas is also a high-end No. 3 Fantasy receiver, and this should be one of his better games this year.

Clemson football will be without 29 players in the Pinstripe Bowl.

Clemson (7-5) faces Penn State (6-6) on Dec. 27 (noon ET, ABC) at Yankee Stadium in New York.

Multiple Tigers players either opted out to transfer or focus on the 2026 NFL draft or are injured, including 11 starters. Clemson is going for its fifth straight win and 15th consecutive year with a postseason victory to extend the longest streak in FBS history, but these losses will make it difficult for coach Dabo Swinney.

Buy Clemson vs. Penn State tickets

""It's a long list, but nobody cares,"" Swinney said Dec. 15. ""It's next-man up, excited to see these guys step up and go play.""

Here's the full list of Tigers who won't play in the Pinstripe Bowl.

Is Antonio Williams playing today?

Clemson's star receiver won't play because of a shoulder injury. Williams announced he will enter the NFL draft after the Clemson-Furman game in November.

Williams has recorded 208 catches for 2,336 yards and 21 touchdowns over four years at Clemson. He is also 4-of-4 passing for 143 yards and two touchdowns in his career.

Why did Peter Woods opt out of Pinstripe Bowl?

Clemson's top defensive tackle is a projected top-10 pick in the NFL draft. This season, Woods logged a career-high 30 tackles, including two sacks, and one pass deflection. He earned first-team All-ACC honors and also rushed for 15 yards and two touchdowns on eight attempts in Clemson's jumbo package.

Woods recorded 84 tackles, including 14.5 for loss and five sacks, and forced two fumbles over 35 games and 24 starts in his career.

Why did Avieon Terrell opt out of Pinstripe Bowl?

Clemson's top cornerback is a projected first- or second-round pick in the NFL draft. Terrell recorded 48 tackles, including three sacks, five forced fumbles and nine pass deflections this season. He was first-team All-ACC and a Jim Thorpe award semifinalist, which is given to the nation's top defensive back.

Why did TJ Parker opt out of Pinstripe Bowl?

Clemson's top edge rusher is a projected first- or second-round pick in the NFL draft. Parker recorded 37 tackles, including five sacks, three fumble recoveries and one pass break up this season.

When does Clemson play Penn State ?

Clemson face Penn State on Dec. 27 (noon ET, ABC) at Yankee Stadium in New York.

Clemson vs. Penn State prediction

Clemson 30, Penn State 27: The Tigers will win their fifth straight game to build momentum for next season. Clemson will be down down key players, especially on defense, but the Tigers will overcome those losses in a high-scoring game.

Clemson will lean on the run game to gash the Nittany Lions on the ground. Quarterback Cade Klubnik will also lead a game-winning drive, and Clemson's defense will force a turnover in the final moments to win.

Several availability questions continue to take shape, as preparations for Sunday night move toward the finish line.

While much of the focus this week has centered on who might not be available, one offensive piece has quietly trended in the opposite direction as the week progressed.

Key Offensive Piece Set to Return

Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall practiced for a third straight day this week and is tracking toward playing Sunday, per Matt Maiocco of NBC Sports Bay Area.

Pearsall entered the week listed with ankle and knee concerns. While he remains officially listed as questionable, his steady presence on the practice field suggests the 49ers are increasingly comfortable with how he’s responded physically as kickoff approaches.

He looks likely to return after missing the 49ers win over the Indianapolis Colts.

Why Pearsall’s Availability Matters for the 49ers

Pearsall’s importance goes beyond the usage.

When active, he adds flexibility to the 49er’s receiver rotation, helping maintain spacing and allowing the offense to stay versatile with personnel groupings. His presence reduces the need to overload snaps elsewhere and gives quarterback Brock Purdy another reliable option.

In his last outing against the Tennessee Titans, Pearsall had 6 receptions on 7 targets, for 96 yards.

The balance he brings will become more valuable late in the season, when defenses tighten windows and the margin for error narrows.

Additional Injury Context Entering Sunday Night

Pearsall is not the only player being monitored.

Tight end George Kittle remains a game-time decision as he continues to manage an ankle injury. The 49ers have taken a cautious approach with Kittle throughout the week, and his status is expected to be determined closer to kickoff.

If he’s unable to suit up, the 49ers could lean on Jake Tonges. The backup tight end was a key contributor in the first half of the season during Kittle’s absence.

On the defensive side, cornerback Renardo Green has been ruled out and will miss another game.

The Bigger Picture for the 49ers

The 49ers have already secured a playoff berth, but the final two weeks remain meaningful.

A win over the Chicago Bears would set up a regular-season finale against the Seattle Seahawks with division positioning and seeding still unresolved.

For now, Pearsall’s trajectory is encouraging. If it holds through the weekend, the 49ers may enter Sunday night with one fewer question mark, even as others remain unresolved.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2234518999-e1759412544451.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-27 20:01:20.107710

The Las Vegas Raiders placed their star defensive end on injured reserve on Saturday, officially ending his season due to a knee injury. The team decided to shut down the five-time Pro Bowler ""with Crosby's best interest in mind,"" even as Crosby wanted to be on the field.

Crosby is expected to undergo knee surgery in the near future that will sideline him into the offseason, too, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Further specifics on that surgery, or a timeline for his return, are not yet known.

While the Raiders may want to not risk further injury for Crosby, they are also chasing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. In facing a fellow 2-13 team in the New York Giants on Sunday, a defeat would improve their chances and not having their best defensive player would aid in that pursuit.

According to the NFL, this will be only the third time in NFL history that two teams that are 11-plus games under .500 will meet and the first time since 1991.

The 27-year-old Crosby was vocal earlier this week about caring more about helping the Raiders win rather than about a first overall draft pick.

""Yeah, I don’t give a s*** about the pick, to be honest,"" Crosby said Tuesday. ""I don't play for that. That's not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world. That's what I focus on every day. Being a great leader, being an influence. Being that guy on a consistent basis for my team.""

After being informed that the Raiders weren't going to let him play against the Giants, Crosby told head coach Pete Carroll that he wanted to leave the facility.

""He knows that he's banged up, so he's talking about, 'I'd like to get out of here.' And I said, 'Yeah, get out of here.' So he took off,"" Carroll said on Friday, via ESPN. ""... This didn't just spring on him. We've been talking about it, and it was exactly what you would think he would do and he should do. I agree with him 1,000 percent on how he responded, and I [would have] responded the same way.""

Crosby has been in the NFL since 2019 and has played 110 regular-season games with the Raiders, but only one playoff game. The Raiders have only two playoff appearances — and zero playoff wins — since appearing in Super Bowl XXXVII at the end of the 2002 season.

Crosby won't be the only Raiders star who will miss out this weekend. Tight end Brock Bowers was placed on injured reserve Wednesday with a knee injury that limited him to 12 games this season.

Defensive tackle Bryan Bresee (knee), running back Alvin Kamara (knee/ankle), tight end Zaire Mitchell-Paden (knee), and right guard Cesar Ruiz (ankle) have all been preemptively ruled out. Veteran tight end Foster Moreau (knee) was placed on injured reserve with rookie backup Moliki Matavao coming up from the practice squad to replace him.

Additionally, a trio of wide receivers Chris Olave (back) and Mason Tipton (groin) plus kicker Charlie Smyth (illness) are questionable. Saints head coach Kellen Moore was optimistic about Olave's status and doesn't anticipate any restrictions for him on Sunday. Smyth's status is worth monitoring as the Saints don't have a backup kicker on the roster.

These issues forced Arsenal to play with central midfielder Declan Rice at right-back and bring Myles Lewis-Skelly into the starting line-up minutes before kick-off.
“We have a lot of issues that we are dealing with,” Arteta said in his post-match news conference.
Something very awkward happened, and today in the warm-up, he wasn’t comfortable.” Heading into the game, Timber was Arsenal’s only fit right-back due to Ben White (hamstring) and Cristhian Mosquera (ankle) being unavailable.
“Yes (the injury issues are uniting the group).","Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta says injury issues are uniting his team after Riccardo Calafiori and Jurrien Timber were ruled out of their win against Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday.

Despite being in control for large periods of the game, the north London side edged a 2-1 victory at the Emirates Stadium to return to the top of the Premier League.

However, they did so without defenders Timber, who Arteta said “landed awkwardly” on Friday, and Calafiori who pulled out of the starting XI after aggravating an issue during the warm-up.

These issues forced Arsenal to play with central midfielder Declan Rice at right-back and bring Myles Lewis-Skelly into the starting line-up minutes before kick-off.

“We have a lot of issues that we are dealing with,” Arteta said in his post-match news conference. “Yesterday (Friday), we lost Jurrien and so today Declan has to play as a full-back.

“You see the performance that he (Rice) put in, so that’s the spirit and that’s how much our players want it.”

When asked about Calafiori’s issue, Arteta said: “It’s something that he felt yesterday. Something very awkward happened, and today in the warm-up, he wasn’t comfortable.”

Heading into the game, Timber was Arsenal’s only fit right-back due to Ben White (hamstring) and Cristhian Mosquera (ankle) being unavailable. Timber played the entirety of the League Cup quarter-final against Crystal Palace on Tuesday and took a penalty in the eventual shootout, as did Calafiori.

However, Arsenal did receive an injury boost before the game with centre-back Gabriel coming on as late substitute for his first appearance since November.

“Hopefully, things will get better and there has been good news as well. For example we’ve got we’ve got Gabriel earlier than expected, which is great,” Arteta continued.

“The staff have done an incredible job, the way he pushes himself as well, that’s what we need. Because we lost one, we’ve got somebody else back.

“Yes (the injury issues are uniting the group). There’s something with Richy (Calafiori), it was something as well, very, very strange. But, I spoke to Declan and told him he needs to play there as a right back, and he said ‘Okay, I’m up for a challenge, I’m going to do my best.’ That attitude is great to witness.”

Willis played well in relief of Love last week in an overtime loss to the Chicago Bears, completing nine of 11 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown. This will be his sixth career start in four seasons.

Head Coach John Harbaugh said the Packers run the same offense with both quarterbacks, and that's how they've been preparing all week, not knowing who would be under center.

""Malik has done a great job. I think he's had a good year when he's played. He's very elusive back there. He throws a good ball. His timing and his mechanics have really looked good this year,"" Harbaugh said.

""So, he's obviously a very dangerous quarterback. He looked good in this last game when he played. So, we'll be very much very respectful of him or whoever's back there playing quarterback.""

Will Henderson play in Week 17?
Henderson was limited in practice on Wednesday and Thursday as he makes his way through concussion protocol.
That is a very promising sign for his status in Week 17 against the Jets.","Thanks to the Denver Broncos holding on for a win over Kansas City on Christmas, the New England Patriots need a win over the New York Jets in Week 17 to still have a chance at the No. 1 seed in the AFC.

New England's 10-game winning streak came to an end in Week 15 with a 35-31 loss to the Buffalo Bills. They responded with a win over the Baltimore Ravens in prime time last week to keep pace with the Broncos atop the AFC.

The Patriots won their first matchup with the Jets: a 27-14 victory on ""Thursday Night Football"" in Week 11. New England's win came thanks to three touchdowns from electric rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson.

Henderson, the team's second-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft out of Ohio State, leads the Patriots in scrimmage yards (997) and touchdowns (eight) through 16 games. This comes even after he missed most of the Patriots' win over the Ravens due to a concussion.

Will Henderson play in Week 17? Here's the latest update.

Is TreVeyon Henderson playing this week?

Henderson was limited in practice on Wednesday and Thursday as he makes his way through concussion protocol. He was on the field for practice again Friday but he was not wearing a red non-contact jersey, per ESPN's Mike Reiss.

That is a very promising sign for his status in Week 17 against the Jets. He had not been officially ruled out as of Friday afternoon.

Concussion protocol timelines are different depending on the player. Some players have cleared the league's five-step protocol in a week while others have taken longer. Henderson playing on Sunday would not be a shock.

Patriots RB depth chart

If Henderson is unable to start, the team will likely rely on veteran Rhamondre Stevenson to take the bulk of the carries against New York. He led the team in rushing in 2022 and 2024.

Crosby told Carroll that he wanted to leave the facility once informed of the team's decision. Carroll agreed.

""He knows that he's banged up, so he's talking about, 'I'd like to get out of here.' And I said, 'Yeah, get out of here.' So he took off,"" Carroll said. ""... This didn't just spring on him. We've been talking about it, and it was exactly what you would think he would do and he should do. I agree with him 1,000 percent on how he responded, and I [would have] responded the same way.""

Crosby has been dealing with a nagging knee injury since the Raiders' 31-0 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7 but has managed to play in every game thus far.

Crosby did not practice this week. After further evaluation, Carroll and the staff thought it was best to rest their best defensive player.

""Each week, he has done everything you could possibly imagine a guy could do to play, and he's been able to,"" Carroll said. ""But after an evaluation we did Monday or Tuesday, whenever it was, it just looks too bad.""

Carroll said it's a possibility that Crosby could also miss the team's season finale against the Chiefs, but an official decision has not been made. Carroll added that he doesn't think the move will impact their relationship.

He and Crosby spoke four times on Friday.

""Hopefully, the right conclusion for his long betterment,"" Carroll said.

Crosby is the third starter to be ruled out of the Raiders' Week 17 contest, in which the loser will assume control of the No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft. Tight end Brock Bowers and safety Jeremy Chinn were placed on injured reserve Wednesday.

Crosby was named to his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl after he totaled 10 sacks and 45 tackles (career-best 28 for loss) in 15 games. When Crosby was asked earlier in the week about the team potentially securing the top pick in the draft, he said, ""I don't give a s--- about the pick. I don't play for that.

""My job is to be the best defensive end in the world, and that's what I focus on every day, and being a great leader and being an influence,"" Crosby said. ""That's [the front office's] job.

The Buckeyes have five players who have the potential to become first-round picks. When Ohio State faces Miami in the Cotton Bowl on Dec. 31, those players will have another big stage where a strong performance can improve their draft stock.

Ohio State had 14 players drafted in 2025, six offensive and eight defensive, with four Buckeyes going in the first round. Defensive players make up four of the Buckeyes' five top NFL prospects for 2026.

Ohio State football NFL draft prospects

Here are five Buckeyes playing in the Cotton Bowl widely regarded as having the most NFL potential.

Caleb Downs

Safety Caleb Downs has been a key player in Ohio State's secondary since transferring from Alabama in 2024, recording 142 tackles and four interceptions across the last two seasons.

Against Miami, Downs will likely be tasked with disrupting the connection between quarterback Carson Beck and wide receiver Malachi Toney. While Downs' draft stock is already high, as he's projected to be a top-10 pick, helping Ohio State hold Toney to anything lower than his average of over six receptions per game would further solidify Downs' draft position.

Kayden McDonald

Last season, Ohio State defensive tackle Tyleik Williams was selected by the Detroit Lions with the 28th pick. Kayden McDonald hopes to be the next OSU player at the position to go in the first round.

If McDonald plays a key role in containing Miami running back Mark Fletcher Jr, who recorded 172 yards against Texas A&M in the first round of the playoff, it would boost McDonald's draft stock.

Arvell Reese

Linebacker Arvell Reese is in the conversation to be the 2026 NFL Draft's No. 1 overall pick. This season, Reese has 62 tackles and 6.5 sacks.

Outside of Ohio State, no team remaining in the playoffs has allowed fewer sacks than Miami. The Hurricanes have given up just 13 sacks in 2025. Reese getting to the quarterback for the first time since Nov. 1 against Penn State would ensure his name remains in the debate for the No. 1 pick.

Sonny Styles

Linebacker Sonny Styles, a Pickerington native, leads the Buckeyes in tackles with 45.

Against Indiana during the Big Ten title game, Styles recorded a career-high 12 tackles, and a similar performance at the Cotton Bowl could improve where he lands in the draft.

Carnell Tate

Wide receiver Carnell Tate is the highest-ranked offensive prospect from Ohio State, with mock drafts on ESPN and CBS Sports projecting him to land somewhere within the top 20 picks.

After missing three games this season due to injury, Tate returned to action against Michigan on Nov. 29 and has since recorded nine catches for 127 yards. Tate having a strong performance against Miami's defense is crucial in proving he's fully past his injury.

Ohio State vs. Miami prediction

Ohio State 14, Miami 7: It took Miami until the final two minutes of its first-round matchup against Texas A&M to score a touchdown and secure a spot in the Cotton Bowl. The Hurricanes will have an even smaller margin of error going against Ohio State's top-ranked scoring defense. If Miami repeats its slow start offensively, the Buckeyes should be able to capitalize, whether OSU's defense turns an error into a touchdown or the Ohio State offense finds a moment to break through the Hurricanes' top-5 scoring defense.

Ohio State vs. Miami TV channel, time

Ohio State kicks off against Miami at 7:30 p.m. on Dec. 31 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.

Malik Willis is expected to start in Love's place.

Both Love and Willis (shoulder/illness) were listed as questionable to play on Green Bay's initial injury report on Thursday. Love remains in concussion protocol and will miss the Week 17 game.

Green Bay clinched a playoff spot Thursday by virtue of Detroit's loss to Minnesota. A loss to Baltimore on Saturday would secure the NFC North title for the Chicago Bears.

Willis won't be the only backup quarterback to see action in Saturday's critical Week 17 game. Tyler Huntley is slated to start for the Ravens in place of Lamar Jackson, who's doubtful with a back contusion.

Ewers struggled in his first start in Week 16, posting a 0:2 TD:INT ratio against the normally putrid Bengals defense.","The Week 17 NFL DFS Yahoo main slate begins Sunday at 1 p.m. EST and features nine games. All of the byes for the 2025 season have wrapped up, but teams playing on Christmas (Cowboys-Commanders, Lions-Vikings and Broncos-Chiefs), Saturday (Texans-Chargers and Ravens-Packers), Sunday Night Football (Bears-49ers) and Monday Night Football (Rams-Falcons) are excluded from the main slate.

Playing in guaranteed prize pool (GPP) Yahoo DFS football contests is about chasing upside, while lineups geared toward head-to-head, 50/50 or double-up formats should prioritize high floors. The players you want to target for these different contest types aren't mutually exclusive, but winning a GPP tournament usually requires finding a hidden gem or going against the grain in a spot or two while building a solid base of the same chalk plays you would use anywhere. Against-the-grain plays typically consist of big-name players in tough matchups or boom-or-bust types with uncertain roles.

Keep in mind that Yahoo DFS football contests use 0.5 PPR scoring rather than full PPR, which lowers the comparative value of wide receivers and running backs (in that order) while especially affecting high-volume pass-catchers. NFL DFS Yahoo lineups consist of one QB, two RBs, three WRs, one TE, one FLEX (RB/WR/TE) and one D/ST unit. Suggested Yahoo DFS picks for Week 17 include one of the NFL's top stacks from the past few seasons, as well as a pair of veterans set for expanded roles in banged-up backfields.

QUARTERBACK

Joe Burrow, CIN vs. ARI ($39): There are a few pricey QBs who could be worth paying up for, but Burrow could be the best of the bunch against the reeling Cardinals. Cincinnati's star signal-caller has mustered a pair of four-touchdown performances in his last three starts, and this battle of fast-paced offenses and porous defenses is expected to produce the most points among games in Sunday's NFL DFS Yahoo main slate (over/under 52.5 points). Arizona's on a seven-game losing streak and has allowed at least 40 points in four of those seven losses. After hanging 45 points on the Dolphins in Week 16, Burrow and the Bengals could easily put up another 40-spot here.

Honorable Mentions: Trevor Lawrence, JAC at IND ($42); Drake Maye, NE at NYJ ($41); Tyler Shough, NO at TEN ($32)

Against the Grainers: Jaxson Dart, NYG at LV ($35); Baker Mayfield, TB at MIA ($33); Philip Rivers, IND vs. JAC ($21)

RUNNING BACK

Ashton Jeanty, LV vs. NYG ($36): Poor offensive line play and negative game scripts have limited Jeanty throughout his highly anticipated rookie season, but the 2025 sixth overall pick showed what he can do when the Raiders keep a game close by turning 25 touches into 188 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns against Houston's elite defense in a 23-21 Week 16 loss. The Raiders will have a chance to pick on someone their own size Sunday in a clash between 2-11 teams that's likely to decide who gets the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Another hefty workload for Jeanty is likely to produce impressive results against a Giants defense that's allowing 122 rushing yards per game to RBs, which is second-most in the NFL.

Rhamondre Stevenson, NE at NYJ ($19): Stevenson could be in line for a massive workload if TreVeyon Henderson (concussion) isn't available, and even if Henderson plays, Stevenson's a nice value at just $19 in a Patriots offense that's likely to employ a run-heavy approach while being banged up at WR. The 12-3 Patriots are likely to play from ahead throughout against the 3-12 Jets, who have allowed a league-high 23 total TDs to RBs this season. Stevenson has recorded at least 77 scrimmage yards in three consecutive games, so he has been effective even while taking a back seat to Henderson.

Honorable Mentions: Chase Brown, CIN vs. ARI ($38); Tony Pollard, TEN vs. NO ($28); Michael Carter, ARI at CIN ($19)

Against the Grainers: Bucky Irving, TB at MIA ($32); Tyrone Tracy, NYG at LV ($27); Kenneth Gainwell, PIT at CLE ($23)

WIDE RECEIVER

Ja'Marr Chase, CIN vs. ARI ($40): Chase and Burrow have been the NFL's top stack over the past couple seasons, and it will likely be worth it to spend the marginal $6 of cap space on Chase over Tee Higgins ($34), especially if you also deploy Burrow. Even as a standalone option, Chase is likely to thrive against a Cardinals defense that allowed 32.2 fantasy points to Puka Nacua in Week 14 and 22.0 fantasy points to Nico Collins in Week 15. Chase has scored at least 18.2 fantasy points five times this season and has seen 59 targets in four games since the Bengals got Burrow back from a toe injury while recording at least 109 receiving yards in three of those four games. You would need to go bargain shopping elsewhere to fit the Burrow-Chase stack into your lineup, but they have the potential to combine for gargantuan numbers against the lowly Cardinals.

Stefon Diggs, NE at NYJ ($25): Diggs is coming off a 138-yard receiving performance against the Ravens in Week 16, and he's likely to get most of the attention from Drake Maye against the generous Jets defense since the Patriots could be without all of Kayshon Boutte (concussion), Mack Hollins (abdomen) and DeMario Douglas (hamstring). The Jets once boasted a formidable secondary but have depleted the roster via trades with an eye on the future. They have been outscored 111-36 over their last three games, surrendering five passing TDs to Trevor Lawrence in Week 15 and a 10-148-2 line to Chris Olave in Week 16. Kyle Williams ($10) could also play an expanded role.

Jakobi Meyers, JAC at IND ($22): It's tough to choose between Meyers, Brian Thomas ($24) and Parker Washington ($20), as all three are strong value plays with the Jaguars rolling on offense and Colts in free fall. Jacksonville is averaging 34.2 points per game during its six-game winning streak, and Lawrence has thrown multiple touchdown passes in five consecutive games, while the Colts have lost five straight and are allowing the second-most receiving yards per game to WRs (170) this season. Indianapolis has also allowed a league-high 201 catches to wideouts this season. Meyers offers the highest floor in Jacksonville's deep WR room, earning at least six targets in six consecutive games while averaging five catches for 60 yards and scoring three times in that span.

Honorable Mentions: Chris Olave, NO at TEN ($38); Michael Wilson, ARI at CIN ($29); Mike Evans, TB at MIA ($27)

Against the Grainers: A.J. Brown, PHI at BUF ($31); Alec Pierce, IND vs. JAC ($21); Jerry Jeudy, CLE vs. PIT ($17)

TIGHT END

Taysom Hill, NO at TEN ($10): Hill worked as the top backfield option for the Saints in Week 16, and he's likely to do so again Sunday since Alvin Kamara (knee/ankle) hasn't played or practiced since Week 12, Devin Neal is on IR due to a hamstring injury, and the Saints don't seem to trust Audric Estime or Evan Hull to handle more than complementary roles. Hill got 12 carries in the Week 16 win over the Jets compared to five apiece for Estime and Hull, and the versatile veteran also threw a 38-yard touchdown pass and caught four passes for 36 yards. Like Diggs, Hill tore his ACL last season, so they are both probably a little more explosive now than they were earlier in the campaign. Hill's unique position as a lead runner with TE eligibility makes him a low-risk, high-reward pick at the minimum $10 against a Titans defense that's allowing 26.9 points per game, which is seventh-most in the NFL.

Honorable Mentions: Trey McBride, ARI at CIN ($30); Harold Fannin, CLE vs. PIT ($20); Juwan Johnson, NO at TEN ($16)

Against the Grainers: Tyler Warren, IND vs. JAC ($17); Mike Gesicki, CIN vs. ARI ($12); Michael Mayer, LV vs. NYG ($10)

DEFENSE

Tampa Bay Buccaneers at MIA ($12): The Buccaneers still control their own destiny in the NFC South despite their 7-8 record, as they will make the playoffs with a win over the Dolphins this week and a victory over the Panthers in Week 18. Sunday's clash between teams from the Sunshine State offers an opportunity for Tampa Bay's defense to shine, as the Dolphins have punted on their season and will start rookie seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers for the second consecutive game. Ewers struggled in his first start in Week 16, posting a 0:2 TD:INT ratio against the normally putrid Bengals defense. The motivated Buccaneers defense will likely make things even tougher on the rookie, as Tampa Bay has a top-10 run defense and ranks in the top 10 with 20 forced turnovers, so Ewers could be forced to throw often against a unit that's adept at taking the ball away.

Honorable Mentions: Pittsburgh Steelers at CLE ($16); New England Patriots at NYJ ($15); New Orleans Saints at TEN ($15)

Against the Grainers: Philadelphia Eagles at BUF ($15); Buffalo Bills vs. PHI ($14); Las Vegas Raiders vs. NYG ($10)

ET) No major injuries of note Both teams are in good shape in the health department for this pivotal Week 17 clash.","We've reached the penultimate week of the 2025 NFL season, and as some teams are trying to improve their playoff positioning, others are trying to just get across the finish line after disappointing campaigns. Injuries are playing a major part of the Week 17 schedule, and bettors looking to place NFL bets for Week 17 need to know the most important NFL injuries of the week, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.

Texans at Chargers (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)

LAC RB Kimani Vidal (neck, questionable)

The Chargers got rookie Omarion Hampton back three weeks ago, and he and Kimani Vidal have largely split touches over that time. That may not be the case this week, with Vidal questionable to suit up against the Texans' elite defense.

The Chargers are 1.5-point favorites. The total is 39.5.

Ravens at Packers (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)

BAL QB Lamar Jackson (back, doubtful)

GB QB Jordan Love (left shoulder and concussion, questionable)

GB QB Malik Willis (right shoulder and illness, questionable)

GB WR Christian Watson (shoulder and illness, questionable)

The Ravens have the slightest of hopes of making the playoffs, but their uphill battle got even harder this week with Lamar Jackson doubtful to play in a must-win game against the Packers. Jackson is far and away the most notable injury for Baltimore, but Green Bay has listed both starting quarterback Jordan Love and his backup Malik Willis as questionable, and it appears Love will not play. Standout receiver Christian Watson is also questionable for Green Bay.

The Packers are favored by 4.5, and the total is 39.5.

Seahawks at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams are in good shape in the health department for this pivotal Week 17 clash. The Seahawks are in the driver's seat for both the NFC West crown as well as the No. 1 seed in the conference. Carolina knocked off Tampa Bay last week and, with a win and Bucs loss this week, could clinch the NFC South. Otherwise, Week 18 could be a massive matchup for the division title.

Seattle is favored by 7. The total is 42.5.

Buccaneers at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams have a few players banged up here, but none that move the needle when it comes to betting lines. The Bucs are a game behind the Panthers in the NFC South and, with a win, would ensure that Week 18's rematch with Carolina has high stakes.

The Buccaneers are 5.5-point favorites, and the total is 44.5

Patriots at Jets (1 p.m. ET)

NE RB TreVeyon Henderson (concussion, questionable)

NE WR Kayshon Boutte (concussion, out)

NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)

The biggest injuries here are with rookies, with New England standout running back TreVeyon Henderson needing to clear concussion protocol for Sunday while New York is again without tight end Mason Taylor, who was a rare bright spot in a trying year for the Jets. Additionally, explosive Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte is out with a concussion.

The Pats are massive 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.

Steelers at Browns (1 p.m. ET)

CLE RB Quinshon Judkins (ankle, out for year)

CLE RB Dylan Sampson (hand, questionable)

CLE TE Harold Fannin Jr. (groin, questionable)

CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)

PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)

The Browns are looking to play spoiler here, and their offense is hurting. Star rookie back Quinshon Judkins is out for the year after ankle surgery, so fellow rookie Dylan Sampson is in line to be the team's RB1 this week, though he's questionable with a hand injury that kept him out of the team's last two games. David Njoku is out again with a knee injury and fellow tight end, standout rookie Harold Fannin Jr., is questionable to play, though it appears he will suit up. The Steelers will still be without T.J. Watt this week after the star edge rusher underwent surgery to repair a collapsed lung. He returned to practice this week but will not suit up until Week 18 at the earliest.

Pittsburgh is a 3-point favorite on the road, and the total is 34.5 -- the lowest of Week 17.

Jaguars at Colts (1 p.m. ET)

IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, questionable)

The Jags are relatively healthy here, while the Colts, who started the year 8-2, are trying to win out and get some help to sneak into the postseason as a wild card team. Indianapolis traded two first-round picks at the deadline for cornerback Sauce Gardner, who is hoping to return to the lineup after a lengthy absence. He's questionable for this AFC South clash. The Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win here if the Texans also lose to or tie with the Chargers on Saturday.

Jacksonville is a 5.5-point favorite. The total is 48.5.

Saints at Titans (1 p.m. ET)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)

NO WR Chris Olave (back, questionable)

The Saints will again be without standout running back Alvin Kamara, though they found an interesting replacement last week in tight end/quarterback/running back hybrid Taysom Hill, who had 78 yards from scrimmage and also a passing score to Chris Olave, who is officially questionable but is aiming to suit up.

The Saints are favored by 2.5, and the total is 39.5.

Cardinals at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)

ARI S Budda Baker (concussion and thumb, out)

ARI WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, questionable)

Both teams have crowded injury reports, but the Cardinals continue to have some awful luck in that department for Week 17. Star safety Budda Baker is out, putting a dent in an already poor Arizona defense. The offense got Marvin Harrison Jr. back last week, but he's questionable again with a nagging heel injury.

The Bengals are 7.5-point favorites. The total is 53.5 -- the highest of the week.

Giants at Raiders (4:05 p.m. ET)

LV DE Maxx Crosby (knee, out)

LV TE Brock Bowers (knee, out for year)

Star Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby is out this week against the Giants, and there's reportedly drama between him and the team. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, the Raiders told Crosby they wanted to shut him down for the remaining two games, and he disagreed and left the facility. Additionally, the team placed second-year tight end Brock Bowers on season-ending injured reserve this week.

New York is a slim 1.5-point favorite. The total is 41.5.

Eagles at Bills (4:25 p.m. ET)

BUF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, questionable)

BUF TE Dawson Knox (knee, questionable)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (knee, foot, out)

Buffalo's tight end depth may get tested here with both Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox questionable with knee injuries in this potential Super Bowl preview against last year's champs, the Eagles. Philadelphia will get star defensive tackle Jalen Carter back after a brief absence, but it won't have right tackle Lane Johnson once again.

Buffalo is a 1.5-point favorite, and the total is 43.5.

Bears at 49ers (8:20 p.m. ET)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, out)

SF TE George Kittle (ankle, questionable)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)

This potential NFL playoff preview has a few big-name pass catchers out or questionable. The Bears will again be down second-year receiver Rome Odunze as he battles a foot injury, and Chicago will certainly be aiming to get him back for the postseason. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is questionable after not practicing all week while receiver Ricky Pearsall is in danger of missing his ninth game of the year.

San Francisco is favored by 3, and the total is 52.5.

Rams at Falcons (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, TBD)

All eyes are on the status of Davante Adams, who missed last week's epic clash with the Seahawks. Adams is the NFL's receiving touchdowns leader, and he can help the Rams two-fold Sunday, as a win helps their playoff standing and also pushes the Falcons further up the NFL Draft order, which is good for L.A. as the team owns Atlanta's first-round pick in April.

Los Angeles is a 7.5-point road favorite. The total is 49.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/29/72e7f03d-e284-40a8-93a7-8769001b775f/thumbnail/1200x675/dde127506b7ea5172563093939b9bdd4/lamar-jackson-baltimore-ravens-imagn-images-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 12:00:52.228203

Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald announced they would be without starting left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant. The Panthers’ game is the second straight game Cross will miss after suffering a hamstring injury, which might put an end to his regular season, against the Indianapolis Colts.

Josh Jones, a versatile offensive lineman who signed with the Seahawks in the offseason, will start in Cross’ place for the second week in a row. Jones played his first significant snaps for the Seahawks last week against the Los Angeles Rams and did not allow a sack against a hungry Rams’ pass rush.

The Seahawks will once again be turning toward Ty Okada for help in the secondary with the loss of Coby Bryant. Bryant suffered a knee injury that held him out of the second half of the Rams game and did not practice at all this week.

Okada has been instrumental for Seattle this season, providing relief when safety Julian Love missed time in the first half of 2025. He’s totaled 58 tackles and snagged his first career interception with an immaculate catch against the Washington Commanders.

The good news for the Seahawks is that Bryant and Cross are the only starters with injury woes after receiving positive news on Riq Woolen and Nick Emmanwori earlier this week. It’s starting to feel like 2013 again as the Seahawks head to Carolina with the NFC’s No. 1 seed on the line on Sunday.",https://platform.fieldgulls.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2025/12/gettyimages-2249816648.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.739416236798%2C100%2C78.521167526403&w=1200,N,,2025-12-26 23:58:25.453026
