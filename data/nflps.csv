""I'm not there yet,"" Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said when asked about Burrow playing on WLW radio. ""One day at practice isn't going to lead to that decision yet.""

Elsewhere in the AFC North — which appears to be the epicenter of quarterback news this week — Lamar Jackson returned to Ravens practice Thursday after missing Wednesday with an ankle injury. That's a new ailment for Jackson, who's battled knee and hamstring injuries as well this season, but he appears in line to start Sunday against the New York Jets as Baltimore tries to claw back atop the division.

The buzziest news of the week is Shedeur Sanders being named the Browns' Week 12 starter at the Raiders, with fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel still in concussion protocol. Sanders struggled in his NFL debut agains the Ravens last Sunday, and we'll see what full week of preparation as the starter can do for him.

Let's finish off the AFC North whiparound with Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who's battling a fractured left wrist. Rodgers said Wednesday that whether or not he starts against the Bears on Sunday isn't a matter of pain tolerance, but rather safety. We'll see if he practices Thursday.

In New York, quarterback Jaxson Dart appears close to clearing concussion protocol, having participated in practice Thursday. Dart missed the Giants' loss to the Packers with a concussion he suffered against the Bears two weeks ago.

Lastly, Packers running back Josh Jacobs will go through individual drills at practice Thursday, per ESPN, to gauge how his knee is feeling after he left Sunday's win over the Giants with an injury. Jacobs missed practice Wednesday but avoided long-term damage, per reports earlier this week.

The Eagles were without two of their starting offensive linemen in the first practice of the week as the team prepares for Sunday afternoon's showdown at the Dallas Cowboys.

Tackle Lane Johnson (foot) and center Cam Jurgens (concussion) were the only Eagles who did not participate in Wednesday's practice.

Fred Johnson, who has served as the jumbo tight end in when the Eagles utilize a sixth offensive lineman, moved over to right tackle after Johnson was injured late in the first quarter. Fred Johnson played 62 snaps on offense in Sunday night's win over the Lions. He also played extended snaps at right tackle in the wins over the Rams and the Packers.

""Lane Johnson is cemented in stone as one of the greats. Fred Johnson is still trying to make a name for himself,"" Fred Johnson said on Wednesday. ""That's how I approach it. Lane, his shoes are already filled in with his work ethic and what he puts out there on film. Now, it's my time to show what I can do on the right side. ... It's a big test for me.""

Brett Toth replaced Jurgens after the Pro Bowl center exited the game in the fourth quarter. Toth previously started at center in the wins over the Giants and the Packers when Jurgens was sidelined with a knee injury.

Outside linebacker Jaelan Phillips was limited on Wednesday with a shoulder injury. Phillips has generated 13 QB pressures in his first two games with the Eagles. According to Next Gen Stats, Phillips also leads the Eagles with seven run stops since arriving in Philadelphia. Phillips was, of course, not with the Eagles in the season opener against the Cowboys.

Offensive linemen Myles Hinton (back) and Willie Lampkin (knee/ankle) were full participants. Both rookies are currently on Injured Reserve, so the Eagles would need to open spots on the roster in order to activate them.

Cowboys hold walkthrough, QB Dak Prescott limited

Coming off their win Monday night in Las Vegas over the Raiders, the Cowboys held a walkthrough on Wednesday.

In an estimated injury report, every Cowboy would have participated in practice, but quarterback Dak Prescott came out of the win on Monday night with a hip injury. He would have been limited in practice.

Prescott is 21-2 against NFC East opponents when playing at home. The .913 win percentage is the best by any quarterback at home against his division rivals since the NFL merger.

The Eagles are coming off back-to-back outstanding defensive performances, holding the Packers and the Lions to seven and nine points, respectively. Since 2023, the Cowboys have scored at least 40 points in seven home games, including three this year (one of them a 40-40 tie vs. Green Bay).

When the Eagles beat the Cowboys 24-20 to open the 2025 NFL season, Dallas was held without a point in the second half.

Defensive end Jadeveon Clowney (shoulder/neck) is new to the injury report. Defensive tackle Solomon Thomas (calf) missed the Raiders game with the injury, but would have been a limited participant on Wednesday.

The team placed quarterback Michael Penix Jr. on injured reserve Wednesday with a partially torn ACL in his left knee. He will undergo surgery at a later date and will be done for the season.

""We'll have Kirk (Cousins), obviously, he's our starting quarterback, going out there and playing for us,"" head coach Raheem Morris said. ""We'll sign Easton Stick to the active roster, get him acclimated and all the things that we gotta get done for him to get on an active roster.

Penix was listed on Wednesday's injury report as a non-participant despite being placed on injured reserve prior to the start of practice. This is because he was still on the active roster at the start of the ""league day."" He will not be on the rest of the injury reports moving forward.

Morris also gave an update on wide receiver Drake London's status as well. He originally said earlier this week that the starting receiver was ""week to week"" with a knee injury he sustained late in the fourth quarter of last Sunday's loss to the Carolina Panthers. Morris added Wednesday that he does not expect London to play this weekend in New Orleans.

""Yeah, usually when I say week to week, I mean, hopefully next week,"" Morris said. ""I don't think he'll be going this week.""

London did not practice in the team's first practice of the week. Morris also confirmed reports that London's knee injury was to his PCL.

In other injury news, the Falcons did see the return of inside linebacker Divine Deablo to practice, with his 21-day window opening up to be promoted back to the active roster. Deablo was placed on injured reserve with a fracture in his forearm four weeks ago. The expectation is the Falcons could see Deablo return to playing form as early as this weekend in New Orleans, barring any setbacks.

Buffalo will be without starting tight end Dalton Kincaid for the second straight week as he continues to deal with a hamstring injury. Meanwhile, the receiver room will be missing both Hardman and Samuel, which leaves Khalil Shakir, Josh Palmer, Keon Coleman, Tyrell Shavers and Elijah Moore as the top options at the position. While he's not on the injury report, Coleman's status will be fascinating to monitor after he was a healthy scratch a week ago.

Houston conducted a walkthrough on Wednesday, but downgraded both Stroud and Pitre to nonparticipants and has since been ruled out. Hill didn't practice all week. Meanwhile, edge rusher Will Anderson Jr. (ankle) was listed as a full participant on Wednesday after being limited to begin the week, and carries no designation for Week 12.

Indianapolis Colts at Kansas City Chiefs (-3.5)

Indy held out defensive end Tyquan Lewis due to a groin injury, and gave corner Kenny Moore II a rest day. They were the only two missing from practice, while the club limited defensive end Samson Ebukam.

Kansas City was without guard Kingsley Suamataia (concussion) and wide receiver Xavier Worthy (ankle) to begin the week. Every other Chiefs player was a full participant on Wednesday.

Minnesota held out guard Will Fries (knee) and outside linebacker Jonathan Greenard (shoulder) on Wednesday.

Running back Josh Jacobs did not practice on Wednesday, but coach Matt LaFleur isn't ruling him out for Sunday just yet. Along with Jacobs, the Packers held out defensive lineman Karl Brooks (ankle), corner Nate Hobbs (knee), linebacker Quay Walker (neck), and wide receiver Savion Williams (foot). Green Bay listed receiver Dontayvion Wicks (calf), receiver Christian Watson (knee), defensive lineman Lukas Van Ness (foot), offensive lineman Zach Tom (back), defensive lineman Micah Parsons (pectoral), corner Keisean Nixon (illness), receiver Matthew Golden (shoulder, wrist), receiver Romeo Doubs (wrist), linebacker Edgerrin Cooper (foot) and safety Javon Bullard (ankle) as limited.

Lamar Jackson (ankle) did not practice on Wednesday, but this appears to be a new routine for the Ravens. John Harbaugh told reporters Wednesday that this is a similar trajectory to last week, when Jackson did not practice on Wednesday, but went on to play in the game. Along with Jackson, receiver Rashod Bateman (ankle), safety Kyle Hamilton (shoulder, groin), tight end Isaiah Likely (calf), corner Keyon Martin (rib), linebacker Roquan Smith (hamstring), offensive tackle Ronnie Stanley (illness), and guard Andrew Vorhees (foot) did not practice.

Receiver Kayshon Boutte (hamstring) practiced fully.

The Bengals listed Joe Burrow as a full participant in practice after he participated in 11-on-11s for the first time since suffering his turf toe injury in Week 2. He is reportedly not expected to make his return for another couple of weeks, but maybe he is ahead of schedule. This comes as Joe Flacco was limited with a right shoulder injury. Meanwhile, the team listed defensive end Trey Hendrickson (hip, pelvis), running back Samaje Perine (ankle), guard Jalen Rivers (knee, ankle), defensive end Cam Sample (oblique), and corner Cam Taylor-Britt (foot) as nonparticipants. Cincinnati also designated tight end Mike Gesicki, who is on injured reserve due to a pec injury, to return to practice on Wednesday.

New York Giants at Detroit Lions (-10.5)

The Giants listed quarterback Jaxson Dart as a limited (noncontact) participant during Wednesday's practice as he continues to recover from a concussion he suffered in Week 10.

The Lions conducted a walkthrough practice on Wednesday, so their opening report is an estimation. That said, the club listed tackles Taylor Decker (shoulder) and Penei Sewell (ankle) as nonparticipants along with corner Terrion Arnold (concussion), safety Brian Branch (toe) and safety Kerby Joseph (knee).

Pittsburgh Steelers at Chicago Bears (-2.5)

As expected, the Steelers held out Aaron Rodgers from Wednesday's practice as he deals with a fracture in his left wrist. Rodgers told reporters that he is going to try and get on the field on Thursday. Along with Rodgers, running back Jaylen Warren (ankle), linebacker Alex Highsmith (pectoral), tight end Jonnu Smith (rest), edge rusher T.J.

Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon relayed on Wednesday that both wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. and running back Emari Demercado will be out this week. They did not practice along with offensive lineman Kelvin Beachum (groin), linebacker Baron Browning (concussion), offensive lineman Will Hernandez (knee), cornerback Will Johnson (back, hip), safety Dadrion Taylor-Demerson (ankle) and offensive lineman Jonah Williams (shoulder). On a more positive note, the team opened the 21-day practice window for running back Trey Benson, who was limited on Wednesday.

Cleveland Browns at Las Vegas Raiders (-4)

Coach Kevin Stefanski told reporters on Wednesday that Dillon Gabriel remains in concussion protocol, and the Browns will start Shedeur Sanders at quarterback. Gabriel did not practice, nor did defensive end Alex Wright (quad) or tight end David Njoku (knee).

The Raiders had one player listed on their initial injury report, noting that defensive tackle Jonah Laulu was limited with a rib injury. Meanwhile, Las Vegas also activated quarterback Aidan O'Connell from injured reserve.

Atlanta Falcons at New Orleans Saints (-1.5)

Atlanta announced on Wednesday that Michael Penix Jr. will undergo season-ending surgery for a partially torn ACL. Kirk Cousins will start going forward.

The left wrist injury he suffered in the first half of Pittsburgh's Week 11 win over Cincinnati has sent Rodgers to the trainers' room this week, leaving him as a non-participant in the Steelers' Wednesday practice. Instead, Rodgers was a willing rehab participant, taking care of what is necessary before testing out his wrist later in the week.

""A lot of rehab,"" the Steelers quarterback said Wednesday afternoon. ""Was thankful to get today to work with (head athletic trainer) Gabe [Amponsah] and just focus on rehab for a day, and try to get back on the field tomorrow and see what we can do.""

Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin confirmed on Tuesday that Rodgers would not need to undergo surgery on his fractured wrist and that the team would take his availablity for Sunday's game day by day.

Rodgers said Wednesday that him playing is not a matter of fighting through pain, explaining it's more about ""safety"" than tolerance.

""Got to get the OK, got to feel like I can protect myself,"" Rodgers said, via ESPN.com.

When asked if his status could be a game-time decision, Rodgers said that would be up to Tomlin.

If Rodgers can't go, Mason Rudolph would be next in line to handle the starting quarterback duties. The veteran backup replaced Rodgers after halftime and delivered a commendable, professional performance against the Bengals, completing 12 of 16 passes for 127 yards and a touchdown while guiding Pittsburgh's offense through the latter stages of what proved to be a runaway win last week.

This week, Rudolph might have to prepare to head to the home of a red-hot Bears team that has won seven of their last eight games but doesn't own a single victory over a team with a winning record. The 6-4 Steelers are aiming to ensure that remains a fact after Week 12, even if they can't play with Rodgers.

Chicago also includes a personal connection for Rodgers: He spent many years facing (and defeating) the Bears while serving as the franchise quarterback of the Green Bay Packers, famously telling their fans he owned them during one of his final wins in Chicago as a Packer.

""There's incentive for every opponent, but I have enjoyed many a Sunday and Monday and Thursdays in that city,"" Rodgers said. ""It's a great sports town, phenomenal sports fans and a great place to play.""

That response included a bit of newfound temperance which has become common for Rodgers in what is expected to be his final NFL season. Instead of stoking the fire of rivalry with a fanbase he's tormented, Rodgers took the high road on Wednesday, perhaps with the hope Bears fans would go easy on him Sunday at Soldier Field.

""I'd rather not be,"" Rodgers said when asked if he thrived on being the villain in Chicago. ""I mean, I'm not in Green Bay anymore. I feel like we can let bygones be bygones. Maybe I can, I guess.

""It's a great rivalry. In the history of all sports, you talk about the Lakers and the Celtics, and the Red Sox and the Yankees, you've got to talk about the Packers and the Bears. There's been some great memories there. When I first got to Green Bay, the Bears had the all-time series lead. When I left, the Packers did. Since J-Love has taken over, it's even gotten better. I hope those fans can put that behind them. I'm sure they can. I don't expect them to.""

Rodgers' closing statement said it all: He knows Chicago's rabid fans will have their intensity turned up to 11 when Rodgers comes to town with his new team in what Bears fans will perceive as a litmus test for their up-and-coming squad. Sure, the Bears are 7-3, but beating the Steelers would grant them a sense of legitimacy they crave.

Taking down Rodgers in the process would make it even sweeter. We'll see if he can suit up and attempt to ruin their dreams one more time Sunday.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/fwrjmjemciidm0268ezh,N,,2025-11-20 13:46:50.193003

While not going into details on any of their ailments, Harbaugh acknowledged that body maintenance is part of the calculation this time of the year, especially after the Ravens had an early Week 7 bye.

“Don’t have a timetable, but it was really positive news from all the doctors that looked at it,” Morris said.
Signing Cousins and drafting Penix were meant to shore up the Falcons’ quarterback position for a decade.
“The one thing we can say about Mike is he’s battle-tested,” Morris said.
“I thought that was a good word from a young player, and I’m sure he’s taking that same perspective now.","FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. — The Atlanta Falcons have seven football games remaining this season. Those have now become a secondary storyline.

On Wednesday morning, the team confirmed starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. has a partially torn ACL and will undergo season-ending surgery on his left knee. The news of the injury was no surprise, but the Falcons’ acknowledgement means they must confront that they have a problem at football’s most important position.

That problem will impact every aspect of an organization that has lost five straight games and has less than a 1 percent chance of making the postseason, according to The Athletic’s playoff projector.

Penix will have surgery “sooner rather than later,” head coach Raheem Morris said, but there’s no guarantee that Penix will be ready for the start of the 2026 regular season, and it’s unlikely he’ll be able to fully participate in the offseason program.

“Don’t have a timetable, but it was really positive news from all the doctors that looked at it,” Morris said. “It’s been looked at by multiple doctors.”

Morris’ confidence in his quarterback leads him to believe that Penix will be ready for Week 1 next year, but the coach acknowledged “that’s a guestimation by me, not medical information.”

“From what we know of Mike and all our research, he will come back stronger,” Morris said. “I have no doubt that Mike is going to attack this rehab and attack what he needs to get done to be ready for his team as soon as possible.”

When Penix returns, he will be a 26-year-old who is halfway through his rookie contract and coming off his fifth season-ending surgery in the last eight years, and the Falcons have to face that reality this offseason when they build their quarterback roster, Morris acknowledged Wednesday.

“You definitely have to go out and make some different plans about the offseason, but we will address that when we get there,” he said. “That’s always got to be something that is on your mind, regardless, but it’s got to be more on your mind now.”

The Falcons’ coaching staff still views Penix as the quarterback of the future, Morris and offensive coordinator Zac Robinson said, but Morris also acknowledged this week that his job could be in jeopardy after only two seasons with Atlanta sitting at 3-7 and facing an eighth straight season outside the playoffs.

In 12 starts and two appearances as a sub, Penix has thrown 12 touchdowns and six interceptions and has a completion percentage of 59.6 percent. In nine starts this year, he is 25th in the league in EPA per dropback (0.00).

“The guy is going to come back stronger for us,” Morris said. “This organization believes him. His coaches believe in him. His guys believe in him.”

Kirk Cousins, who will take over as Atlanta’s starter, is under contract for the next two seasons, but he would have a $57.5 million cap hit each of those seasons, and it’s unrealistic to believe the team will keep him on the roster at that price considering they can release him and only incur a $35 million dead cap hit spread over two seasons. Signing Cousins and drafting Penix were meant to shore up the Falcons’ quarterback position for a decade. Half of that plan has imploded with Cousins’ benching last year. Now, the Penix portion of the plan faces an uncertain future.

The Falcons signed Easton Stick off their practice squad to the active roster on Wednesday and signed Kyle Trask to the practice squad, but neither looks to figure into the team’s long-term plan at the position. Finding an insurance policy to protect against Penix’s health is not going to be easy, though. The upcoming 2026 quarterback free agency market looks thin, and Atlanta traded away its 2026 first-round pick last offseason in a deal that brought James Pearce Jr. to the team.

Morris is not second-guessing the team’s decision to draft Penix with the No. 8 pick in the 2024 draft despite his long injury history, the coach said.

“I have a lot of confidence in what we did as far as the draft,” he said. “Injuries happen.”

Penix suffered two ACL tears in his right knee (in 2018 and 2020) and a season-ending joint injury in each shoulder (2019 and 2021) during his collegiate career. He did not suffer any damage to the left knee until this season, when he sat out Week 8 due to a bone bruise on the knee and then sustained the torn ACL against the Panthers last week. Those injuries were unrelated, according to a team source.

“The one thing we can say about Mike is he’s battle-tested,” Morris said. “I have nothing but confidence in Mike to bounce back and get to the point to be able to play for us.”

Penix was in “as good spirits as you can be” Wednesday, Robinson said. The coach lives in the same suburban Atlanta neighborhood as the quarterback and said he plans to drop by and check on Penix throughout his rehab.

“Mike’s our guy,” Robinson said. “He’s handled adversity before, and we know he’ll handle it as well as he can, but obviously, we all feel sick about it. (We) know that he’ll bounce back stronger than ever. He’s just a mentally tough guy. Obviously, we’re praying for him and the procedure and everything to go well. We love Mike, love what he was doing throughout the season, especially in that game. He was playing at such a high level. We are all wrapping our arms around him.”

“It’s sad,” running back Bijan Robinson said. “I hate when one of my teammates gets hurt, especially all that he’s been through. For him to get injured like that again, I just hate it. I hate it for him. I hate it for this team. I hate it for his family. He’s such a great guy. I told him, ‘God has a plan for you. He didn’t do this for no reason.’ I know that he’s taking it hard right now, and we are too, but we just have to push forward for him.”

Cousins believes Penix can bounce back from this injury because Penix’s athletic testing numbers with the Falcons suggest his previous injuries didn’t impact his athleticism, Cousins said.

“He is someone who has handled adversity so well through his football journey, and unfortunately he’s having to do it again, but I’m very confident he has a lot of good football ahead of him, more good football ahead of him than behind him for sure, but unfortunately he’s just going to have to be patient with it,” Cousins said. “Tough deal, we will be supporting him as he goes through his rehab process.”

Cousins reflected Wednesday on a conversation he had with Penix while jogging onto the field before a game last year.

“I said, ‘Do you ever get nervous before games?’ He said, ‘Not really because I’ve been through so much, and when you’ve been through so much, you just enjoy the opportunity,'” Cousins said. “I thought that was a good word from a young player, and I’m sure he’s taking that same perspective now. But that’s why your heart breaks for him.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/19182737/GettyImages-2247021109-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-20 13:46:56.300796

**UPDATED AS OF WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 19TH AT 7:30 PM ET**

🏈 AFC East

◆ Buffalo Bills

Dalton Kincaid - TE (hamstring)

Kincaid emerged from the team’s Week 10 loss to the Dolphins with a hamstring injury. He remains sidelined and will not play in Week 12 against the Texans.

Fantasy Impact: Fox Sports’ Jordan Schultz reports Kincaid is labeled as “week-to-week.” Fellow tight end Dawson Knox played 77% of the team’s offensive snaps in each game Kincaid has missed this season but did not see more than three targets in either game. Fantasy managers probably are best looking elsewhere for help through byes this week.

Khalil Shakir - WR (personal)

Shakir is good to go for Week 12 against the Texans after missing practice this week.

Fantasy Impact: Shakir should be started as a WR3/FLEX, per usual.

◆ Miami Dolphins

Tyreek Hill - WR (knee)

Hill suffered a dislocated knee in the team’s Week 4 win over the Jets. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Hill’s absence likely places additional emphasis on the short-to-intermediate areas of the field, increasing the expected target volume for De’Von Achane, Darren Waller, and Jaylen Waddle. Malik Washington is likely to step into a secondary role and could see his aDOT improve, making him a sneaky potential FLEX option for the remainder of the season. Waddle sees the biggest boost to his fantasy value once he returns from his Week 12 bye.

Darren Waller - TE (pectoral)

Waller managed just 28% of the team’s offensive snaps before departing with a pectoral injury in Week 7. He was placed on injured reserve on Wednesday.

Fantasy Impact: Waller’s absence leaves additional snaps available for Tanner Conner, although he is unlikely to warrant fantasy consideration in a difficult matchup.

◆ New England Patriots

Rhamondre Stevenson - RB (knee)

Stevenson has been ruled out for Week 11 against the Jets, missing his third consecutive game. He returned to practice in Week 12 as a limited participant on Wednesday.

Fantasy Impact: Rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson started in Stevenson’s stead for the second consecutive game, erupting for a breakout game in the win over the Buccaneers. He followed that up with a three-touchdown game in Week 11 and appears to be headed for RB1 status if he can maintain control of the backfield once Stevenson returns. Stevenson will likely remain FLEX-viable, even if Henderson operates as the starter.

Austin Hooper - TE (concussion)

Hooper was diagnosed with a concussion following their Week 10 win over the Buccaneers, and did not play in Week 11 against the Jets. He was limited at Week 12’s Wednesday practice.

Fantasy Impact: Assuming Hooper remains setback-free, he should be available to earn one or two targets, per usual.

◆ New York Jets

Garrett Wilson - WR (knee)

Wilson sprained his knee in his return to the active roster in Week 10 and is set to miss “three-to-four weeks.” He was placed on injured reserve and is eligible to return in Week 15.

Fantasy Impact: Whelp, Wilson’s return didn’t last long as he is now set to miss another chunk of time with an additional knee injury. The Jets again find themselves bereft of pass-catching talent. Rookie tight end Mason Taylor stands to benefit the most in a fantasy setting, although the Jets continue to be allergic to throwing the football. Head coach Aaron Glenn said last week that he expects Wilson to “return this season.”

Braelon Allen - RB (knee)

Allen suffered a “pretty serious” knee injury on a kickoff return in the second quarter of the team’s Week 4 loss to the Dolphins. He is out indefinitely.

Fantasy Impact: Allen has been a significant contributor in the red zone this season. His absence substantially boosts Breece Hall‘s upside, who is now a locked-in RB1 in Week 5 against the Cowboys. Backup running back Isaiah Davis can be stashed in 12-team leagues as a high-upside contingency option. Hall gained a season-high 155 yards from scrimmage on 18 opportunities in his first game without Allen in Week 5.

Josh Reynolds - WR (hip)

Reynolds was evidently placed on injured reserve in Week 10, after suffering a hip injury during practice in Week 8.

Fantasy Impact: Reynolds’ absence clears the way for new Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to be active on game day.

🏈 AFC North

◆ Baltimore Ravens

Lamar Jackson - QB (ankle)

Jackson was sidelined by an ankle injury to open Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: Jackson has dealt with hamstring, knee and ankle injuries this season while finishing as the QB9, QB17 and QB19 over the last three weeks. His ceiling remains in the elite QB1 tier if active, though his play does appear to be impacted.

Rashod Bateman - WR (ankle)

Bateman was seen in a walking boot following the team’s Week 10 win over the Vikings and is reportedly dealing with a high-ankle sprain. He remains sidelined to begin Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach John Harbaugh said he “thinks Bateman will be okay” and that the team will “see how serious it is going forward.” Any missed time from Bateman could increase the team’s 12-personnel utilization, raising Mark Andrews and Isaiah Likely‘s fantasy value along the way, but Likely is now dealing with a calf injury. Andrews stands to benefit.

◆ Cincinnati Bengals

Joe Burrow - QB (toe)

In Week 11, Burrow said he is targeting a Week 13 return from the surgery-worthy, Grade III turf toe injury he suffered in Week 1. He is practicing in full for Week 12, and seemingly has a chance to play this week.

Fantasy Impact: Fill-in starting quarterback Joe Flacco (shoulder) remains a QB1 until Burrow returns. Stay tuned.

Samaje Perine - RB (ankle)

Perine was labeled “week-to-week” with a high-ankle sprain suffered in Week 9. He is doubtful to play in Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: The Cincinnati backfield has been less than stellar from a fantasy perspective in 2025, although starter Chase Brown saw a ridiculous 96% snap rate after Perine departed in Week 9. Rookie Tahj Brooks is on hand to soak up change-of-pace duties for as long as Perine remains sidelined.

Mike Gesicki - TE (pectoral)

Gesicki was placed on injured reserve after suffering a pectoral injury in Week 6. He was designated to return and is practicing in full for Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: Gesicki’s return turns the Bengals’ tight end room into a fantasy-unfriendly platoon.

◆ Cleveland Browns

Dillon Gabriel - QB (concussion)

Gabriel suffered a concussion in the team’s Week 11 loss to the Ravens. Fellow rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders will start in Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Kevin Stefanksi said Tuesday that Gabriel will remain the starter once healthy. Sanders should not be in starting lineups against the Raiders this weekend.

◆ Pittsburgh Steelers

Aaron Rodgers - QB (wrist)

Rodgers fractured his non-throwing, left wrist in Week 11 and was sidelined at Week 12’s Wednesday practice, as expected.

Fantasy Impact: Rodgers will play this weekend if he and the medical team deem him capable of protecting himself despite the injury. Backup quarterback Mason Rudolph could be started in superflex leagues if Rodgers is inactive.

Jaylen Warren - RB (ankle)

Warren suffered an ankle injury in Week 11 but said he “could have returned” to the game. He was sidelined the following Wednesday.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Mike Tomlin followed that up with “hopeful” comments when discussing Warren’s potential status for Week 12. It appears as if the team will have its lead back when they face the Bears, though Warren should currently be viewed as questionable to play. No. 2 running back Kenneth Gainwell would operate as a full-time player if Warren is unable to play.

🏈 AFC South

◆ Houston Texans

C.J. Stroud - QB (concussion)

Stroud will miss his third straight game in Week 12 after suffering a concussion in the Texans’ Week 9 loss to the Broncos.

Fantasy Impact: Backup Davis Mills will draw his third consecutive start in a difficult matchup at home against the Bills on a short week.

Joe Mixon - RB (foot)

Mixon was placed on the Non-Football Injury list ahead of Week 1 and is eligible to be activated in Week 5. The team stated that the veteran back is “making progress” and will be re-evaluated in a few weeks.

Fantasy Impact: Veteran Nick Chubb is now in a game script-dependent rushing role, while rookie running back Woody Marks operates as the starter.

◆ Indianapolis Colts

Anthony Richardson - QB (eye)

Richardson suffered a “freak accident” ahead of Week 6 in which an elastic band snapped a piece of metal hit him in the eye, fracturing his orbital bone. He was placed on injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Richardson has been off the fantasy radar all season with Daniel Jones’ career reemergence. Backup quarterback Riley Leonard can be stashed in superflex leagues, if need be.

◆ Jacksonville Jaguars

Brenton Strange - TE (hip)

Strange was unable to finish the team’s Week 5 game against the Chiefs due to a hip injury. The team placed him on injured reserve the very next day. He has been designated to return and opened the Week 12 practice week limited.

Fantasy Impact: Strange was fantasy’s TE20 in PPR scoring when the team designated him to return, but his 15.3% team target share ties for second among Jaguars pass catchers. Journeyman Hunter Long stepped into the primary pass-catching role following Strange’s departure, but he is unlikely to become a viable starter. Fantasy managers should expect the Jaguars’ established wide receivers and running backs to compete for chunks of Strange’s vacated target share. Strange would be a TE1 if active.

Brian Thomas Jr. - WR (ankle)

Thomas has not played since suffering a high-ankle sprain in Week 9. He was a limited participant in Week 12’s Wednesday practice.

Fantasy Impact: Thomas has already dealt with wrist and shoulder injuries in an extremely disappointing season this year. Even if active, Thomas is a shaky WR3.

Bayshul Tuten - RB (ankle)

Tuten departed the team’s Week 11 win over the Chargers with an ankle injury in the fourth quarter. He was limited on Wednesday.

Fantasy Impact: We’ll have to wait and see how Tuten is managed in practice this week, but early reports were that the injury is feared to be a high-ankle sprain, meaning he could be facing an absence in Week 12. He is currently on track to play, though.

Travis Etienne - RB (shoulder)

Etienne was limited on Wednesday.

Fantasy Impact: Etienne is on track to play in Week 12. Pass-catching specialist, rookie running back LeQuint Allen is a name to know, in case Tuten and/or Etienne cannot play.

Travis Hunter - WR/CB (knee)

Hunter was placed on injured reserve with a season-ending LCL tear.

Fantasy Impact: See Thomas’ section above.

◆ Tennessee Titans

Calvin Ridley - WR (hamstring)

Ridley reportedly broke his fibula in Week 11 and is out for the season.

Fantasy Impact: It’s a disappointing end to a disappointing season for the veteran receiver. The Titans are left with no standout fantasy options in his absence.

Elic Ayomanor - WR (hamstring)

Ayomanor did not practice on Wednesday.

Fantasy Impact: Ayomanor is unlikely to play this week, which should help wide receiver Chimere Dike (chest) vie for FLEX-viability.

🏈 AFC West

◆ Denver Broncos

J.K. Dobbins - RB (foot)

Dobbins was ruled out on Friday before being placed on IR on Saturday. The injury requires surgery, which would end his season.

Fantasy Impact: Rookie RJ Harvey would be in line to see a noticeable increase to what has been a modest snap rate, although Tyler Badie remained frustratingly involved. Jaleel McLaughlin also saw increased opportunities on early downs.

◆ Kansas City Chiefs

Isiah Pacheco - RB (knee)

Pacheco was considered “week-to-week” after spraining his MCL in Week 8 against the Commanders. He is practicing fully for Week 12 against the Colts.

Fantasy Impact: Pacheco is on track to play, and can be treated as a borderline RB2/3 if active.

Xavier Worthy - WR (ankle)

Worthy did not practice on Wednesday.

Fantasy Impact: Worthy’s potential absence does little for the Chiefs’ volatile downfield wide receiver platoon. Wide receivers Hollywood Brown and Tyquan Thornton could earn one or two extra targets.

◆ Las Vegas Raiders

The Raiders escaped their blowout loss to the Cowboys in Week 11 absent any noteworthy injuries.

◆ Los Angeles Chargers

Omarion Hampton - RB (ankle)

Hampton was placed on injured reserve this week after suffering an ankle injury in the team’s Week 5 loss to the Commanders. He will miss the next four games, at minimum. Recent reports indicate he was still in a walking boot following the team’s Week 8 win over the Vikings and will not have his practice window opened until after the team’s Week 12 bye.

Fantasy Impact: Running back Kimani Vidal continues to operate as the team’s clear lead back after handling a 64% snap rate or higher in all four games following Hampton’s injury. That said, season-ending injuries to both tackles has influenced the team’s ability to consistently run the football, resulting in sporadic fantasy production from Vidal.

Najee Harris - RB (Achilles)

Harris ruptured the Achilles tendon in his left leg during the Chargers’ Week 3 win over the Broncos. His season is done.

Fantasy Impact: See above.

🏈 NFC East

◆ Dallas Cowboys

Dak Prescott - QB (hip)

Prescott was limited at Wednesday’s walkthrough after suffering a hip injury in the Cowboys’ Week 11 Monday Night Football game against the Raiders.

Fantasy Impact: Prescott should be good to go an a mid-tier QB1 against the Eagles this weekend.

Miles Sanders - RB (ankle/knee)

Sanders was injured in Week 4 and did not play in Week 5. He was ruled out for Week 6 before being placed on injured reserve, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Veteran Javonte Williams continues to operate in a near workhorse role.

◆ New York Giants

Jaxson Dart - QB (concussion)

Dart departed the team’s Week 10 loss to the Bears with a concussion. He was a limited participant in Wednesday’s non-contact practice, indicating he is in phase three or four of the NFL’s five-phase concussion protocol.

Fantasy Impact: It currently appears as if Dart will return when the Giants take on the Lions in Week 12.

Darius Slayton - WR (hamstring)

Slayton seemingly aggravated his prior hamstring strain last week and did not play in Week 11 against the Packers. He could be looking at a multi-game absence and remains sidelined early in Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: Slot receiver Wan’Dale Robinson and tight ends Theo Johnson and Daniel Bellinger should see a slight uptick in target volume. Veteran journeyman Isaiah Hodgins finished with the second-most targets among Giants pass catchers in Week 11.

Malik Nabers - WR (knee)

Nabers suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 4 win over the Chargers and will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.

Fantasy Impact: The injury could not have come at a worse time for the Giants after they moved to rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart under center. Nabers’ absence will make it difficult to consistently move the football, lowering the upside of all remaining healthy players. Nabers makes for a solid trade target for dynasty managers looking to rebuild this season.

Cam Skattebo - RB (ankle)

Skattebo suffered a gruesome dislocated ankle in the team’s Week 8 loss to the Eagles, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: The backfield in New York should revert to a timeshare headed by veteran Tyrone Tracy in Skattebo’s absence. Devin Singletary remains on hand for change-of-pace duties. Treat Tracy as a low-end RB2 for the remainder of the season.

◆ Philadelphia Eagles

The Eagles are healthy coming out of their Week 11 win over the Lions.

◆ Washington Commanders

Jayden Daniels - QB (elbow)

Daniels dislocated the elbow in his left, non-throwing arm in the team’s Week 9 loss to the Seahawks. The team said there is no timetable for his return, but the second-year quarterback could have avoided a season-ending injury after X-rays revealed he avoided a fracture. He was ruled out for Week 11 on Thursday.

Fantasy Impact: Marcus Mariota will start for the Commanders for the foreseeable future, slightly denting the fantasy upside of all primary skill position players in the process. Fantasy managers in a bind could do worse than taking a flier on Mariota, considering his rushing upside.

Terry McLaurin - WR (quad)

McLaurin aggravated his quad injury in Week 8. He did not play in Week 9 against the Seahawks and is not expected to play in Week 10 against the Lions. He has already been ruled for Week 11.

Fantasy Impact: Commanders wide receiver Deebo Samuel, tight end Zach Ertz and, to some degree, running back Jeremy McNichols have proven themselves as the most reliable remaining pass catchers.

Noah Brown - WR (groin, knee)

Brown was placed on injured reserve in Week 7.

Fantasy Impact: Wide receivers Jaylin Lane, Luke McCaffrey and Chris Moore are splitting the vacated role, making them difficult to trust as re-draft FLEX options. McCaffrey’s 2.84 yards per route run notably lead the team by 1.05. His exceptional per-play efficiency could earn him more work as the season progresses.

🏈 NFC North

◆ Chicago Bears

D’Andre Swift- RB (hip)

Swift was limited on Wednesday.

Fantasy Impact: This is likely just maintenance. Expect Swift to handle starting duties on game day.

◆ Detroit Lions

Sam LaPorta - TE (back)

LaPorta was added to the Lions’ injury report with a back injury on Wednesday. After being ruled out for Week 11 on Friday, the Lions placed him on injured reserve on Saturday.

Fantasy Impact: The Lions’ pass-catching corps is deep. Removing LaPorta from it could result in one or more extra targets for WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR Jameson Williams and RB Jahmyr Gibbs.

◆ Green Bay Packers

Josh Jacobs - RB (knee)

Jacobs departed the team’s Week 11 win with a knee injury. Initial reports indicated the knee to be “structurally sound,” while head coach Matt LaFleur followed it up by saying the veteran back is dealing with a knee contusion. He did not practice on Wednesday.

Fantasy Impact: Chris Brooks saw only five offensive snaps in Week 11, leaving Emanuel Wilson in a borderline workhorse role after Jacobs’ departure. There is no way of knowing if that level of usage will continue should Jacobs miss games, but it currently looks as if fantasy managers can bid aggressively on Wilson in this week’s waiver runs.

Romeo Doubs - WR (chest)

Doubs is playing through a chest injury. He was limited on Wednesday.

Fantasy Impact: Veteran wide receiver Christian Watson (knee) was limited as well, though the team consistently gives him an easy workload on Wednesday. Rookie wide receiver Matthew Golden (shoulder/wrist) was also limited, though he has taken a backseat in the passing game to Doubs and Watson.

Jayden Reed - WR (collarbone/foot)

Reed fractured his collarbone in the Packers’ Week 2 game against the Commanders and was already playing through a Jones fracture in his foot. When news of the expected collarbone surgery broke, the Packers were reportedly hoping to get Reed back in November. Reed then revealed that he underwent surgery to correct his Jones fracture as well. It is unknown whether this will extend his recovery timeline. As of Week 12, he appears close to returning.

Fantasy Impact: Reed can be stashed in injured reserve spots, but he does not need to be held in leagues without them.

Tucker Kraft - TE (knee)

Kraft suffered a season-ending torn ACL in the team’s Week 9 loss to the Panthers.

Fantasy Impact: Kraft’s breakout season comes to an end prematurely after the untimely knee injury. Luke Musgrave should be rostered in all formats as he likely enters a featured role for the Packers.

◆ Minnesota Vikings

Carson Wentz - QB (shoulder)

Wentz will undergo season-ending surgery after playing through a dislocated shoulder and torn labrum.

Fantasy Impact: Second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy is the starter in Minnesota moving forward.

🏈 NFC South

◆ Atlanta Falcons

Drake London - WR (illness)

London reportedly suffered a PCL sprain in the team’s Week 11 loss to the Panthers. Falcons head coach Raheem Morris “hopes” London can play in Week 13.

Fantasy Impact: We could see the veteran alpha miss multiple games for the Falcons, which, when combined with the absence of Michael Penix, could thrust tight end Kyle Pitts into a featured role, considering the struggles of Darnell Mooney thus far.

Michael Penix - QB (knee)

Penix reportedly suffered a knee injury that included a partially torn ACL, a separate sprain and a bone bruise in the team’s Week 11 loss to the Panthers. He will undergo season-ending ACL reconstruction.

Fantasy Impact: That leaves the team in the hands of veteran Kirk Cousins moving forward. Cousins notably completed 21-of-31 passes for only 173 yards with no touchdowns in his only other start this season, which came against an underperforming Dolphins team. The Falcons could be in some trouble the rest of the way.

◆ Carolina Panthers

Bryce Young - QB (ankle)

Young suffered an ankle injury in Week 11, but managed to play through it after a trip to the locker room.

Fantasy Impact: We do not yet have an update on Young’s status. The Panthers play the 49ers on Monday.

◆ New Orleans Saints

Alvin Kamara - RB (ankle)

The Saints continue to manage Kamara’s practice reps as he nurses a lingering ankle injury.

Fantasy Impact: None. Kamara should be active, per usual, this weekend.

Kendre Miller - RB (ACL)

Miller suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 7 loss to the Bears. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Rookie Devin Neal should step into the primary change-of-pace role for the Saints in Miller’s absence. Lead back Alvin Kamara saw the highest snap rate since Week 2 following Miller’s departure and could be again looking at a workhorse role moving forward.

◆ Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Bucky Irving - RB (foot/shoulder)

Irving is considered week-to-week after injuring his foot in Week 4. He returned to practice in Week 11, yet is said to be in “rehab mode.” He was seen practicing to early in Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: Sean Tucker has supplanted Rachaad White as the starting running back, sans Irving. If Irving suits up in Week 12, Tucker likely reverts to his rotational rushing role while White chips in on passing downs.

Chris Godwin Jr. - WR (fibula)

Godwin was sidelined in Weeks 6-10 before returning to practice in Week 11. He is said to be in “rehab mode” and was ruled out for Week 11.

Fantasy Impact: See below.

Mike Evans - WR (collarbone, concussion)

Evans suffered a broken collarbone in the team’s Week 7 loss to the Lions. He is expected to miss “most of the season.”

Fantasy Impact: Evans managed to play just under two quarters before the injury after returning from three missed contests due to a hamstring injury. Considering the current state of the roster, rookie Emeka Egbuka is looking like a true league-winner.

Jalen McMillan - WR (neck)

McMillan remains on injured reserve with a neck injury suffered in the preseason.

Fantasy Impact: The Buccaneers are reeling at wide receiver with McMillan, Chris Godwin and Mike Evans out.

🏈 NFC West

◆ Arizona Cardinals

Marvin Harrison Jr. - WR (appendicitis)

Harrison was ruled out for Week 11 after undergoing an emergency appendectomy on Wednesday. The team also ruled him out early in Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: Harrison’s emergency operation leaves wide receiver Michael Wilson as the only healthy starter. Tight end Trey McBride is in line to see all the volume he can handle, while veteran slot man Greg Dortch is flirting with FLEX status after averaging over 13 fantasy points per game in games where he has seen more than 66% of the team’s offensive snaps while with the Cardinals.

Emari Demercado - RB (ankle)

Demercado suffered a high-ankle sprain in Week 11 and has already been ruled out for Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: We expect Bam Knight (ankle) to be the starter until Trey Benson is ready to return from injured reserve.

Trey Benson - RB (knee)

Benson underwent surgery after injuring his meniscus in Week 4. The Cardinals opened his 21-day practice window in Week 12. He was limited on Wednesday.

Fantasy Impact: Add Benson if he is available. He should quickly work his way toward handling an RB2-level workload when active.

Kyler Murray - QB (foot)

Murray injured his foot on a fourth-quarter fumble in Week 5. He was placed on injured reserve in Week 10 and will be eligible to return in Week 14 against the Rams, though it could be as the Cardinals’ backup.

Fantasy Impact: Quarterback Jacoby Brissett has finished as a QB1 in his last three games. He remains a viable streamer.

James Conner - RB (ankle)

Conner suffered a season-ending foot injury in Week 3.

Fantasy Impact: See: Trey Benson.

Zay Jones - WR (Achilles)

Jones suffered a torn Achilles in the team’s Week 10 loss to the Seahawks, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Jones filled a situational role for the Cardinals but his absence could provide additional run for veteran slot man Greg Dortch.

◆ Los Angeles Rams

Tyler Higbee - TE (ankle)

Higbee was placed on injured reserve after suffering an ankle injury in the team’s Week 11 win over the Seahawks.

Fantasy Impact: Higbee’s absence for much of the game against the Seahawks simply allowed rookie Terrance Ferguson to step into additional snaps as opposed to forcing the team to move away from their league-leading 13-personnel rates. Colby Parkinson should be viewed as the team’s de facto starter.

Tutu Atwell - WR (hamstring)

The Rams placed Atwell on injured reserve Monday.

Fantasy Impact: Jordan Whittington is in line to soak up WR3 duties, if active, for a Rams offense heavily concentrated amongst Nacua, Davante Adams, and running back Kyren Williams. Whittington is listed as questionable with a back injury for Week 10.

◆ San Francisco 49ers

Brandon Aiyuk - WR (knee)

Head coach Kyle Shanahan said the team would not open Aiyuk’s 21-day practice window ahead of a Week 11 meeting with the Cardinals. The same was said for Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: A mostly lost season for Aiyuk appears to be quickly approaching, at least as far as fantasy is concerned.

◆ Seattle Seahawks

Tory Horton - WR (groin, shin)

Horton was added to the injury report Thursday with multiple ailments and did not play in Week 10 against the Cardinals. He was ruled out for Week 11 on Friday and remains sidelined early in Week 12.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ac0d10d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7491x4214+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F61%2F5a%2Fd52f689a4ef7bb2a8dc62d1bdde1%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D27342961,N,,2025-11-20 13:47:01.488909
