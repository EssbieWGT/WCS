This week, George Kittle was spotted back out on the golf course just two weeks after his devastating injury. Although he isn’t able to put weight on his foot, that hasn’t stopped him from hitting long-range shots.

George Kittle hit the course this week with 49ers teammates Brock Purdy, Trent Williams and Kyle Juszczyk. However, the 32 year old didn’t even need to leave his golf cart thanks to a new device from Power2Golf.

The company’s $1,500 device was shouted out by Kittle on his Instagram and allows him and other golfers to hit the ball from the comfort of a golf cart and avoiding having to stand up.

The 49ers lost in blowout fashion last week against the Seattle Seahawks without Kittle available. However, San Francisco will be hopeful that Kittle can return to his All-Pro self in time for the 2026 season.

Advertisement New England Patriots at Denver Broncos, 3 p.m.","Jarrett Stidham has been one of Sean Payton's guys since the Denver Broncos head coach was hired in 2023. The 29-year-old quarterback was an early free agent signing that offseason after Payton came on board. Little did they know then that the veteran signal calling, who has not thrown an NFL pass in over two seasons, would be the one who could help get them to a Super Bowl.

""Stiddy's been waiting for this moment for the entirety of his career,"" said Broncos offensive tackle Mike McGlinchey. ""He's more prepared than anybody would be in this situation. And he can ball, he can flat out play quarterback. We've seen it every day in practice. We've seen it in training camp.

""I have no doubts he's going to go out there and play his butt off.""

Bo Nix is out for the rest of the season with a broken bone in his ankle.

It'll be up to Stidham to navigate Denver past the New England Patriots, the team he was drafted by in 2019 and spent his first three NFL seasons.

While a long shot, Broncos running back J.K. Dobbins, how since Week 10 with a foot injury, has been limited in practice this week.

The Patriots don't have any major injury concerns, but could potentially get back Mack Hollins. The wide receiver has missed four games with an abdominal injury, but the team designated him for return from injured reserve this week. Hollins was limited during Thursday's practice.

One concern was defensive tackle Christian Barmore, whose previous issues with blood clots could have been an issue in the thin Denver air. But head coach Mike Vrabel said it should not be a problem.

""Certainly something we have to monitor,"" Vrabel said. ""There are some players that we'll have to monitor for one reason or another, but I don't see any limitations for Christian.""

While the Seattle Seahawks will be down running back Zach Charbonnet after he tore his ACL last week, quarterback Sam Darnold (oblique) will be fine to play and is off the injury report.

""Feel like the process is going right along where it should be,"" Darnold said. ""Feeling really good for Sunday.""

The first notable thing is the situation around J.K. Dobbins. Head coach Sean Payton would not confirm if he’ll be playing earlier today, but now that the final injury report is out we can see he is ruled out for this game. That was something we were all hoping would not be the case, but he did continue to practice so if Denver can get past the Patriots we might see him on the field for the Super Bowl.

Good news on the Pat Bryant front, though. Payton confirmed that he had no concussion symptoms the day after and he’s had his helmet upgraded. I’m assuming that means the padded larger-sized helmet. I’m cool with that. Anything to help him stay safe and out there helping the team win.

For the Patriots, they will be down their team sack leader with outside linebacker Harold Landry being ruled out for the game. Anything that helps keep Jarrett Stidham in a clean pocket is welcome news and hopefully this means he’ll get more help on interior protection assignments.

As in the regular season just ended — and many seasons before that — producer Jim Rikhoff and director Mike Arnold will be at the front bench.

I’ll also start to work on the opener and talk to Jim Nantz, Tony, and Mike to get their feedback.","The CBS Sports production team will close out its 2025-26 NFL campaign on Sunday with its largest show of the year: the AFC Championship in Denver. As in the regular season just ended — and many seasons before that — producer Jim Rikhoff and director Mike Arnold will be at the front bench. Despite adding cameras, replay machines, and other technology for the New England Patriots–Denver Broncos matchup, the core philosophy remains unchanged: keep the focus on the game. Or, as Rikhoff puts it, “The better the game, the less I do.”

SVG sat down with Rikhoff and Arnold to discuss how they’re preparing for their final NFL broadcast of the season, the high SkyCam and other cameras added for the playoffs, the impact of the pregame national anthem and postgame trophy presentation, and how Bo Nix’s injury instantly transformed the narrative for this weekend’s game.

As you look ahead to Sunday, how does your overall production philosophy change from a regular-season game? How do you go about providing that “big game feel” to a broadcast like the AFC Championship?

Rikhoff: Overall, our philosophy doesn’t change that much. Our primary objective is always to cover the football game itself. We don’t ever want to force production elements, and, in the playoffs, we might even be even a little more judicious with those production elements. If the game is good, I just stay out of the way and let Mike cut the game. The better the game, the less I do, and often, I believe, less is more — especially in the playoffs. We could do six games with all the [production elements] we have, so we leave a lot of great stuff out.

I would say 90% of our coverage is exactly what we do on a normal regular-season game, but those added cameras, tape machines, and technology are there for those few special moments that you might not have in a regular-season game. In a playoff game or a Super Bowl, you want to make sure you have every possible angle covered for that huge play that everyone is going to remember. I feel very confident that we have just that going into Sunday.

Any specific examples of the cameras and technologies you have added for the playoffs?

Rikhoff: We add technical equipment as the playoffs go on, and the high SkyCam is probably the biggest addition. Last week, we used seven or eight angles from that, and it was really successful. Tony [Romo] loves to draw on the Telestrator, which gives us another angle. Now we have a slash angle, the All-22, the conventional SkyCam, and the high SkyCam. That’s four angles to show people what happened on the field, which allows us to mix it up a lot more.

And we have other really cool things, like Sky Dry. Those little things and tweaks can make a difference in a big game like this.

How about you, Mike. Does your philosophy change with an AFC Championship Game like this weekend’s broadcast?

Arnold: As Jim said, our core coverage is going to be 90% the same, but the added cameras and EVS machines will show up in subtle ways. We have added a couple of mini [cams] on each sideline to maybe get that reaction shot of a quarterback or a coach or a defensive player on the bench that we wouldn’t have had otherwise. We have added two more low–end-zone [cameras] on each side for a total of four. That allows us to have one low–end-zone following in front of the ball and one behind the play. Those are going to give us some replay looks that we wouldn’t have had.

What does your prep schedule look like this week leading up to Sunday?

Rikhoff: On Tuesday mornings, we have a big production meeting on Zoom and briefly review what we did well and didn’t do well the week before. Then we talk about all the production elements, storylines, and matchups for [the upcoming week]. We’ll come up with ideas for specialty graphics, tape packages, historical vignettes, and those kinds of things. That gets the ball rolling, and the ADs and the BAs start creating all that [content].

On Wednesdays, I start writing out a full schedule for the show. I’ll also start to work on the opener and talk to Jim Nantz, Tony, and Mike to get their feedback. I put together a list of 10-15 major storylines, which I call our golden list. I always say, “Don’t do the game you prepare for; do the game that unfolds.” It’s a live event so you can’t be overly structured.

Saturday, Mike and I will go out to the trucks in the morning. We’ll look at all the new graphics and check out a lot of the new technology and make sure everything’s working. We’ll have a production meeting at our hotel to go through the open, look at all the graphics, look at all the tape, and talk about schedules.

Sunday will be really busy. Now we have THE NFL TODAY+ streaming show and THE NFL TODAY, which is on for two hours, and then we have a 3½-hour game. You’re looking at a seven-hour day of coverage.

Finally, when [the game kicks] off, I take a deep breath and just relax because that’s the fun part and is what I’ve been waiting for all week.

Mike, does your weekly routine look different from an average week’s?

Arnold: There are pieces of this game that we don’t normally do, like covering the anthem and the postgame trophy presentation. We have to have an entire meeting on where the singer will be located, who is singing, if it’s one person or a chorus, which way they’re facing.

For the postgame trophy ceremony, now it’s always on the field. Same questions: where will the stage be, and which way will it be facing? We need to make sure our cameras have access into the pen area.

And, as Jim mentioned, we have THE NFL TODAY+ and THE NFL TODAY onsite. We need to figure out which cameras we’re sharing with those shows and make sure [camera operators and technicians] are scheduled correctly so they don’t burn out before the game even starts. Logistics are a much bigger part of the AFC Championship Game than on a regular game.

Any other big changes to your show on Sunday compared with the regular season?

Rikhoff: Aside from the anthem and the trophy presentation, the other big thing we do is add Evan Washburn [as a second sideline reporter]. That means we have options, but we want to ensure there is balance.

I think the defining thing about our game telecasts is that every week looks different because we react to the game. For me, that’s the best part of the job: we react to the game that happens. To me, the better the game is, the less I have to do. I can just get out of the way and let Jim and Tony, Tracy and Evan, and Mike do their thing.

How do you integrate all the technology that you have at your fingertips without overwhelming the broadcast

Arnold: We try to add technology where it makes sense but never add it just for the sake of adding technology. For example, we added a wind graphic last week, and, even though it wasn’t that windy in Denver, the graphic showed that the wind wouldn’t affect the kick. It was additive to the broadcast.

Rikhoff: Fortunately for us, Patty Power, [EVP, Operations and Engineering]; Jason Cohen, [SVP, Remote Technical Operations]; Craig Stevens, [VP, Remote Engineering]; and their team are always 100% supportive of what we do, and it’s up to us to use all this technology smartly. A lot of [using technology] is just being patient and waiting for the right moment.

What are you looking forward to this weekend specifically, and what are the key storylines you’ll be keeping a close eye on

Rikhoff: When we heard the news about Broncos quarterback Bo Nix’s injury, it was kind of a gut punch because we were all excited about these two great young quarterbacks facing off. But you adapt and find a new hook, which is now you have this journeyman kid, Jarett Stidham, who hasn’t thrown a pass in the NFL since 2023, playing in the biggest game of his life. There have been only seven guys that started their first game of the season in the playoffs and only one that won the game. This is a great story, and we’ll build it up.

Arnold: I’m looking forward to what I hope will be a good, close, competitive game. We’ve had two great ones so far, and, hopefully, our luck continues on Sunday. It’s a unique environment there in Denver, and I expect it to be another great game for us.

Not included in either group? Cornerback Carlton Davis.

Davis was limited the first two practice of the week, and was wearing a red non-contact jersey as he went through concussion protocol. Not having an injury status on the report indicates he was cleared and is good to go. That's a big boost to the Patriots' secondary, with Davis able to line up on the opposite boundary of Christian Gonzalez, with Marcus Jones in the slot.

Also removed from the injury report was center Garrett Bradbury. Bradbury missed practice with an illness on Thursday, but returned as a full participant on Friday.

Among the three questionable players, only linebacker Marte Mapu (hip) is currently on the active roster. Mapu missed practice Wednesday and Thursday, but returned as was limited on Friday.

The other three players who are questionable - running back Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol), wide receiver Mack Hollins (abdomen), and defensive tackle Joshua Farmer (hamstring) - are all currently on IR but designated to return. In order to be eligible to play on Sunday, any or all of the players would have to be officially activated by 4 p.m. ET on Saturday. The Patriots would need to open up a roster spot in order to make that happen.

Meanwhile, edge rusher Harold Landry (knee) was the lone player ruled out for the game on Friday. Landry has been dealing with that knee injury for most of the season, and played just 11 snaps in the Divisional Round win over the Houston Texans last weekend.

For the Broncos, they ruled out four players including running back J.K. Dobbins (foot). Dobbins was the team's leading rusher this year, but has been on IR since early November with that foot injury. He returned to practice this week and was limited all three days, but Denver will be without him for this one. RJ Harvey has handled most of the running back snaps in Dobbins' absence.

Denver could get a couple of other key offensive players back. Wide receiver Pat Bryant (concussion) was not given an injury designation, likely meaning similar to Davis he's cleared the protocol. Fellow wideout Troy Franklin (hamstring) also left last week's game early, but is questionable after being limited all week. Center Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) is questionable after being a full participant all week - he was also designated to return from IR this week.",https://985thesportshub.com/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2249267966.jpg?auto=webp,N,,2026-01-24 12:01:14.829696

Your Fantasy Teams Need Help

Rank Me Up Now

Rankings from 2 of the top 5 most accurate analysts … including #1

Ravens Hire Jesse Minter as Head Coach

Baltimore moved quickly to secure Jesse Minter as its next head coach, turning to a familiar face with deep Harbaugh roots and a defensive resume that’s been quietly elite. Minter spent the last two seasons running Jim Harbaugh’s defense with the Chargers after previously doing the same at Michigan, and his NFL ties go back to John Harbaugh’s staff from 2017 through 2020. At just 42, Minter brings continuity, aggression and modern structure to a Ravens team that still believes defense can drive winning. The next key move will be offensive coordinator, where Bills OC Joe Brady and former Commanders OC Kliff Kingsbury are already being floated as names to watch. From a fantasy angle, this hire keeps Baltimore’s defensive identity intact while putting pressure on the OC hire to fully unlock Lamar Jackson’s ceiling.

Bills Cast Wide Net in Head Coaching Search

Buffalo continues to explore every lane in its search for a new head coach, completing an interview with former Giants head coach Brian Daboll and sitting down with Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo while also bringing offensive coordinator Joe Brady in for an internal meeting. Daboll’s history with Josh Allen from 2018 to 2021 remains the cleanest schematic fit, as Buffalo finished top five in yards and points during that stretch, while Anarumo offers a defense-first alternative after spending 2025 running Indianapolis’ unit following his Bengals tenure. Brady remains the continuity option after two seasons as Bills OC, but the volume and variety of interviews suggest the organization is seriously weighing whether to double down on offense or pivot philosophically after moving on from Sean McDermott.

Coordinator Carousel Spins Across the League

Three coordinator hires came together quickly as teams reshuffled their staffs ahead of 2026, with the Buccaneers finalizing a deal for Falcons offensive coordinator Zac Robinson, the Cowboys hiring Eagles defensive backs coach Christian Parker as defensive coordinator, and the Falcons bringing in Browns offensive coordinator Tommy Rees. Robinson arrives in Tampa after two run-leaning seasons in Atlanta that quietly propped up the ground game despite quarterback instability, making him an intriguing fit for Baker Mayfield and Bucky Irving. Parker steps into Dallas as a Fangio-influenced defensive mind at just 34 years old after working under Vic Fangio in Philadelphia, while Rees reunites with Kevin Stefanski in Atlanta after interviewing for Cleveland’s head coaching job and falling just short. None of these moves scream splash, but each signals a clear organizational direction heading into the offseason.

Dolphins Signal Full Reset at Quarterback

Dolphins general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan made it clear that Miami is starting from scratch under center, openly stating the team needs to find its long-term answer at quarterback. Sullivan emphasized building infrastructure first, while acknowledging that Tua Tagovailoa, Quinn Ewers or someone not currently in the building could eventually take the reins. The comments strongly suggest Tagovailoa is headed toward a post-June 1 release, while Ewers could be moved if the right offer materializes. From a fantasy lens, this points to volatility in Miami’s offense for 2026, especially until clarity emerges at the most important position.

Injury Ward

Sam Darnold (oblique) was limited Thursday but remains firmly on track to start for Seattle in the NFC Championship Game against the Rams. Darnold threw at practice and has consistently played through the injury, though the matchup history is concerning after six interceptions in two meetings with Los Angeles this season.

J.K. Dobbins (foot) remained limited for Denver as he continues working back from a Lisfranc injury suffered in Week 10. He’s trending toward questionable status and would need a full practice to truly feel safe for the AFC Championship Game.

Pat Bryant (concussion) practiced fully and is trending toward clearance for Denver’s matchup with New England. The rookie played a meaningful role early last week and should again be involved if he avoids a setback.

Troy Franklin (hamstring) was limited after exiting last week’s game early, leaving his availability in doubt. Hamstring injuries are notoriously tricky, and his status is one to monitor closely through the final report.

Mack Hollins (abdomen) was designated to return from injured reserve by New England and resumed practicing, giving him a chance to suit up this weekend. His return could squeeze snaps for Kayshon Boutte, though Boutte’s strong postseason showing may keep him on the field regardless.

The stage is set, the coaching market keeps moving, and the margins only get thinner from here. As Championship Sunday approaches, every personnel decision and injury update carries weight well beyond this weekend. We’ll be back tomorrow to keep breaking it all down as the league races toward the Super Bowl.

NFL Daily Dive — Jan. 22, 2026

The postseason spotlight keeps narrowing, but the news cycle doesn’t. Front offices are making franchise-defining decisions, coaching searches are taking shape, and roster news is already bleeding into how 2026 will be evaluated. With Championship Sunday approaching, here’s a full rundown of everything that moved across the league in the last 24 hours and why it matters.

Bills Cast a Wide Net Post-McDermott

Buffalo continued its exhaustive head coaching search, completing an interview with offensive coordinator Joe Brady while also lining up or requesting interviews with Anthony Lynn, Anthony Weaver, Brian Daboll, Grant Udinski and Lou Anarumo, a group that spans continuity, familiarity, youth and defensive philosophy. Brady offers the smoothest transition for Josh Allen after two seasons running the offense, Daboll brings history from Allen’s developmental years, Udinski represents a sharp pivot toward a modern passing-centric identity, while Lynn and Weaver would signal a broader cultural reset. The common thread is urgency, as the Bills appear determined to maximize the remaining prime years of Allen rather than simply maintaining competitiveness.

Josh Allen May Need Offseason Surgery

Speaking of Allen, Bills president of football operations Brandon Beane acknowledged that Allen could require offseason foot surgery stemming from an injury suffered late in the regular season, though he expressed confidence it will not impact Allen’s availability for spring work. Allen gutted through the injury during the postseason and remains the centerpiece of Buffalo’s championship window, but the situation bears monitoring as the Bills reshape their coaching staff.

Ravens Zero in on Jesse Minter

Baltimore completed a second interview with Chargers defensive coordinator Minter, reinforcing his status as one of the leading candidates for the job. Minter’s familiarity with the organization and his recent defensive success continue to stand out, though the Ravens have not rushed the process and still have other candidates under consideration. If hired, Minter would inherit a roster built to win now, making this one of the more immediately impactful coaching decisions of the cycle.

Browns Target Youth at Head Coach

Cleveland has reportedly identified Rams pass game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase and Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski as finalists for its head coaching vacancy, signaling a clear preference for a younger, offense-forward hire. Both candidates fit the profile of a long-term builder rather than a stabilizer, and while the situation remains fluid, the Browns appear committed to modernizing their offensive identity after years of inconsistency at quarterback and play-caller.

Raiders Lean Offensive with Top Pick Looming

League chatter suggests the Raiders are prioritizing an offensive-minded head coach to pair with what is expected to be the top overall pick, with Klint Kubiak and Davis Webb frequently mentioned while Jesse Minter remains loosely connected. With Tom Brady involved in the decision-making process and a rookie quarterback likely entering the building, Las Vegas appears focused on finding a coach who can grow alongside a young passer rather than resetting again in two years.

Vikings Lock in Brian Flores … Kind of

Minnesota signed defensive coordinator Flores to a contract extension, ensuring continuity if he does not land a head coaching job this cycle. Flores remains a candidate for openings elsewhere, but the Vikings have guaranteed stability on the defensive side after back-to-back top-10 finishes, a move that preserves their identity regardless of how the rest of the coaching market shakes out.

Brandon Aiyuk Headed for a New Team

49ers general manager John Lynch confirmed Aiyuk has played his final snap in San Francisco after the team voided future guarantees in his contract. Despite signing a massive extension just one year ago, Aiyuk is expected to hit the open market, with early speculation pointing toward Washington or Pittsburgh. His departure creates significant ripple effects for both San Francisco’s offense and fantasy managers evaluating his next landing spot.

Injury Ward

Sam Darnold (oblique) was limited in Wednesday’s practice but remains on track to start the NFC Championship Game after showing no visible limitations last week despite minimal throwing leading up to kickoff.

George Holani (hamstring) was activated from injured reserve by Seattle and is expected to operate as Kenneth Walker III’s primary backup, with a chance to see rotational work this week following Zach Charbonnet’s season-ending injury.

J.K. Dobbins (foot) returned to practice after being designated to return from injured reserve and has a legitimate chance to be activated for the AFC Championship, though his role alongside the existing backfield remains uncertain.

Pat Bryant (concussion) practiced Wednesday and is trending toward availability after exiting last week’s game, putting him on track to play if he clears protocol.

Bo Nix (ankle) underwent successful surgery and will miss the remainder of the postseason, shifting Denver’s offense to Jarrett Stidham while setting Nix up for a full offseason recovery.

The coaching carousel is tightening, roster decisions are accelerating, and the ripple effects are already reshaping how we think about 2026. The next few days won’t just decide who advances, they’ll determine who controls the league’s future.",https://dmxvtdt4jwgem.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Troy-Franklin.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 23:59:21.578898

Buffalo is searching for a new head coach after firing Sean McDermott last week.","The Buffalo Bills interviewed Philip Rivers for their vacant head coaching job, the team confirmed Friday.

Rivers, 44, came out of retirement this season to be the Indianapolis Colts' quarterback after an injury to starter Daniel Jones. He is currently the head coach at St. Michael Catholic High School and has held the job since 2021. He's compiled a 43-15 record during his tenure.

The Bills are the first team to interview him in this year's head coaching cycle. If he gets the job, Rivers would be the first full-time NFL head coach without previous college or pro coaching experience since 1961, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. The Colts hired Jeff Saturday on an interim basis with the same lack of experience in 2022.

Rivers went 0-3 in three starts with Indianapolis this season, completing 63% of his throws for 544 yards and four touchdowns. He was selected fourth overall by the New York Giants in the 2004 draft, but he was packaged in a trade to the then-San Diego Chargers for Eli Manning after Manning refused to play for the Chargers organization.

Rivers is an eight-time Pro Bowler who accumulated almost 64,000 passing yards during his 18-year NFL career. The NC State product led the league in passing yards in 2008 and earned the Comeback Player of the Year award in 2013.

He joins a Bills interview list that includes Mike McDaniel, Joe Brady, and Brian Daboll.

Pearsall's emerging on-field chemistry with quarterback Brock Purdy was promising, and many speculated he would be the first-string replacement for the absent Brandon Aiyuk. However, the 25-year-old was one of the many 49ers players to find himself on the 49ers' inevitable injured reserve list.

He missed eight weeks and the NFC Wild Card win over the Philadelphia Eagles with a lingering knee injury from Week 4 against the Jacksonville Jaguars and an ankle injury from an illegal hit in Week 15 against the Tennessee Titans. Rookie safety Kevin Winston Jr. was ultimately fined by the NFL for the rough hip-drop tackle on Pearsall.

Coach Kyle Shanahan downplayed any concerns that the young wide receiver is ""injury prone"" during the end-of-the-season press conference on Wednesday.

""I think if you guys saw the film or you saw his stats, the stats did match the film,"" he said. ""I think he was leading the league in a lot of categories before he got hurt, I want to say versus Jacksonville, and then he landed on his knee the wrong way.""

San Francisco 49ers

Find the latest San Francisco 49ers news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California.

He noted that Pearsall made improvements the previous offseason before coming into 2025 training camp, ""Added some weight, was able to get through a training camp because he did train the right way, and that's why I thought he went into those first few weeks of the season ready to go,"" he praised.

Shanahan further shared his thoughts on how Pearsall could be better prepared for the 2026 season.

""So, I think the main thing from last year is, man, what can we do to come back from that faster? When you do come back, what can we do to maybe not redo it, so it doesn't linger?"" he said.

Shanahan also admitted Pearsall played to his full potential in just four of the nine regular-season games he suited up for, and that his aggravated Week 4 PCL injury was a huge obstacle.

""Even though I think he might have dressed in eight, but he was Ricky for four games and that didn't have to do with how he went into this year, that had to do with an injury that he had in Week 4,"" he said.

The upcoming offseason will be detrimental to how the 49ers structure their future receiver roster. Brandon Aiyuk has most likely played his last snap with the team and veteran Jauan Jennings is a hot target for the upcoming free agency market.

Linebacker Harold Landry III has been ruled out for Sunday's game, according to Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel. Cornerback Carlton Davis, wide receiver Mack Hollins, and linebacker Marte Mapu will all be listed as questionable heading into Denver.

Landry III had two tackles against the Houston Texans in last week's playoff game. He's been battling a knee injury and led the Patriots with 8.5 sacks on the season.

Davis had a monster game against the Texans, making 4 tackles to go with 2 interceptions. He sustained a head injury in the game.

Davis has played admirably as the man opposite of Pro Bowl cornerback Christian Gonzalez.

Hollins is working his way back from an abdominal injury that landed him on the injured reserve list in late December.

He was spotted at practice working with the receivers for the first time on Thursday.

The 6'4"" Hollins was a reliable target for quarterback Drake Maye with 46 catches on the year for 550 yards and 2 touchdowns.

He is also a reliable blocker in the run game.

Mapu played one defensive snap in each of the Patriots' previous two playoff games and has mostly been a special teams and rotational player for New England.

The Patriots have a strong offense, ranked third overall, while the Broncos boast the league's second-best defense.

Vrabel said the key to winning on Sunday will be consistency.

Patriots quarterback Drake Maye threw three touchdown passes last week.

Denver's defense led the league with 68 sacks this season. Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham is making his first start since 2023 with Bo Nix out with an ankle injury. He is 1-3 in his four NFL starts.

Vrabel is attempting to become the eighth coach in NFL history to reach the Super Bowl in his first season with a team.

Both teams are coming off big wins, with the Patriots defeating the Texans and the Chargers.

The Broncos have a 4-1 edge in the playoff matchups between the teams, winning all four games in Denver. The two most recent meetings were in the AFC championship games during the 2013 and 2015 seasons, and were both won by the Broncos.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-2256100320-6973c5ac92f73.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.846xh;0,0.0634xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2026-01-24 01:58:16.523093

Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald added that Darnold ""did great"" in practice this week. ""Everything's going to plan, let's put it that way. He's going to play, and we'll take it day by day.""

In other positive injury news, the Seahawks will have left tackle Charles Cross for Sunday's game despite a foot injury that kept him out of practice on Wednesday and Thursday. Cross was a full participant in Friday's practice and does not have a game status designation on the final injury report, meaning he is good to go.

""Charles practiced today,"" Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said. ""He's getting better, but he should be able to play.""

Cross, who exited Saturday's win over the 49ers due to the injury, said, ""I feel good. Really just leaned on my preparation, getting mental reps this week, understanding the gameplan, just being ready to play fast and execute.

New England Patriots at Denver Broncos (3 p.m. ET)

DEN QB Bo Nix (ankle, out for season)

DEN WR Troy Franklin (hamstring, questionable)

No injury has more of an impact on betting lines this weekend than Bo Nix. Nix, Denver's starting quarterback, broke a bone in his ankle late in Denver's overtime win over Buffalo last week. He's out for the rest of the postseason after needing surgery, and the Broncos now turn to backup Jarrett Stidham under center. Stidham hasn't started a game since Week 18 of the 2023 season, and he notably was drafted by Denver's opponent, the Patriots, back in 2019. Second-year standout receiver Troy Franklin is also questionable with a hamstring injury.

The Patriots are favored by 4.5 points on the road due in large part to the Nix injury. The total is 42.5.

Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (6:30 p.m. ET)

SEA QB Sam Darnold (oblique, will play)

SEA RB Zach Charbonnet (ACL, out for season)

The Seahawks got a bit of a scare at practice last week when Sam Darnold suffered an oblique injury that resulted in a questionable game status, but the veteran quarterback played as Seattle blew out the 49ers. That blowout likely helped keep Darnold healthier, as the Seahawks leaned on the run game while Darnold sat out most of the fourth quarter with the game out of reach. Darnold and the Seahawks won't have one of their top playmakers on offense, however, as Zach Charbonnet tore his ACL last week. He's been Seattle's go-to guy in the red zone, leading the team with 12 rushing scores. More focus will be on Kenneth Walker III to carry the load in the run game, and the team activated second-year back George Holani from injured reserve on Friday to serve as the No. 2 back behind Walker on Sunday.

Seattle is a 2.5-point favorite at home. The total is 46.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/17/bc544dde-9640-4b68-abe4-262d4f249dc7/thumbnail/1200x675/fdc1bd993e94aea20db2ab8962d171b8/bo-nix-denver-broncos-imagn-images.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 19:59:14.492584

Manning, who became the Longhorns’ full-time starting quarterback in 2025 and helped them to a 10-3 record, underwent the procedure as a preventative measure, the school said. It did not disclose the nature of Manning’s previous injury, but said he is expected to be back during spring football.

In 2025, Manning started all 13 games, throwing for 3,163 yards and 26 touchdowns with seven interceptions. He was also the team’s second-leading rusher, with 399 yards and 10 scores on the ground.

Manning, who entered 2025 as the Heisman Trophy favorite according to oddsmakers, shook off a rough start to the season with a strong second half, accounting for 20 touchdowns with just two turnovers in his final six games. He led Texas to three consecutive wins to close out the year, including an upset over then-undefeated Texas A&M in the regular-season finale and a win over a ranked Michigan in the Citrus Bowl. Manning won MVP honors for the bowl game.

Manning is one of six Texas players who had offseason surgery to address various issues. Receivers Ryan Wingo (wrist) and Emmett Mosley V (ankle), left tackle Trevor Goosby (shoulder), linebacker Ty’Anthony Smith (shoulder) and defensive back Xavier Filsaime (shoulder) each have had procedures to address injuries since the season ended. Wingo, Mosley, Goosby, Smith and Filsaime are all expected to be back and 100 percent healthy by the start of the season, the school said.

Texas finished No. 12 in the final Associated Press Top 25 but missed the College Football Playoff after entering the 2025 season No. 1 in the poll. Expectations will again be high in 2026. The Longhorns debuted at No. 5 in The Athletic’s Way-Too-Early Top 25 for the 2026 season.

Dobbins will not play against the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game Sunday, despite practicing on a limited basis this week.

Dobbins had limited participation in all three of Denver’s practices this week, but was listed as out for Sunday’s game on the team’s official injury report Friday. Those were his first workouts with the team since suffering a Lisfranc foot injury on Nov. 6 during a win against the Las Vegas Raiders. He had surgery the following week, and a league source initially said Dobbins was targeting a return for the Super Bowl, if the Broncos made it that far. His participation in practice this week indicates Dobbins could still be on track to return for that game if Denver wins Sunday.

Over the course of 10 games this season, Dobbins rushed for 772 yards and four touchdowns. His yardage total ranked fifth in the NFL at the time of his injury, and his mark of 5 yards per carry was seventh among running backs with at least 100 rush attempts at that point. Despite missing the final seven games of the regular season, Dobbins still finished as Denver’s leading rusher with 232 yards more than rookie replacement R.J. Harvey. The Broncos ranked ninth in rushing before the Dobbins injury (128.6 yards per game), but they were 23rd (104.6) after he went down.

Denver’s other running backs, Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin, rushed for 41 yards on just 10 carries in Saturday’s win against the Buffalo Bills. They may need to be a bigger part of the equation Sunday as the Broncos start Jarrett Stidham at quarterback in place of Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury at the end of that divisional round victory.

The Broncos will have rookie wide receiver Pat Bryant available against the Patriots. The third-round pick caught a pass on each of the three snaps he played against the Bills in Denver’s divisional round victory Saturday, but he suffered a concussion after the third of those receptions, his second such head injury in the past month. Bryant cleared the league’s concussion protocol this week, practicing in a limited fashion on Wednesday and then as a full participant on Thursday and Friday. Fellow wide receiver Troy Franklin, who practiced on a limited basis this week after leaving in the second quarter of the game against the Bills with a hamstring injury, is questionable.

Center Luke Wattenberg, who practiced in full this week for the first time since landing on injured reserve with a shoulder injury in Week 16, is listed as questionable. The Broncos would need to clear a roster spot to activate Wattenberg ahead of Sunday’s game. That would likely be done by placing Nix on injured reserve, as expected.

Backup center Alex Forsyth, who filled in as the starter during Wattenberg’s injury but exited late in the game against the Bills with an ankle issue, is also listed as questionable.

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold (oblique) and left tackle Charles Cross (foot) are both considered good to go for Sunday’s NFC title game against the Los Angeles Rams, as neither carried a game status designation on Friday’s injury report.

Seahawks make their move at RB ahead of NFC Championship

Darnold was limited in practice all week, but that was expected as he continues to manage an oblique injury that cropped up on Jan. 15. Darnold was listed as questionable heading into last weekend’s divisional round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers, but started and played into the fourth quarter of Seattle’s 41-6 rout.

Cross, who suffered a foot injury in the third quarter of the divisional round game, was upgraded to a full participant in Friday’s practice after sitting out Wednesday and Thursday.

Rams’ sack leader questionable for NFC title game vs Seahawks

Cross being healthy enough to start Sunday is particularly important, given that Seattle’s top two backup left tackle options are both dealing with injuries as well.

Backup left tackle Josh Jones (knee, ankle) is listed as questionable, while third-string rookie left tackle Amari Kight (knee) is doubtful. Jones was a full participant on Friday after sitting out practice Wednesday and Thursday. Kight was sidelined from practice all week.

Meanwhile, rookie fullback Robbie Ouzts (neck) is questionable and reserve linebacker/special teams player Chazz Surratt (ankle) was ruled out.

No other Seahawks were given game status designations, which means every other player on their 53-man roster is considered healthy enough to play on Sunday.

Philip Rivers' reemergence into the NFL could continue on the sidelines in 2026. The Buffalo Bills are interviewing Rivers on Friday for their head coaching job, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported, per sources.

Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham hasn't started a game since 2023 and has attempted just 197 passes since entering the NFL in 2019, but the Patriots aren't taking their former fourth-round pick lightly ahead of Sunday.

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold threw 14 interceptions in 2025. Six of those came in two games against the Los Angeles Rams.

The New York Giants hired John Harbaugh, whose Ravens made the postseason in 12 of 18 seasons, to help develop second-year quarterback Jaxson Dart.

On Friday, New England ruled OLB Harold Landry III out after weeks of battling through a knee injury. The Patriots also listed WR Mack Hollins (abdomen), LB Marte Mapu (hip), DL Joshua Farmer (hamstring), and RB Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol) as questionable. After being in the league's concussion protocol this week, CB Carlton Davis III was cleared to play and won't carry an injury designation into Sunday's game in Denver.

Hollins opened his 21-day window to be activated off injured reserve by returning to practice on Thursday and was a full participant in Friday's session. The versatile wideout hasn't played since sustaining an abdomen injury in the Patriots win over the Ravens in Week 16, a blow to the offense due to Hollins' size, catch radius, and blocking ability. Hollins allows the Patriots to blur the lines between three-receiver groupings and two-receiver formations as a blocking chess piece in the run game. He is also a big target for QB Drake Maye on vertical routes and routes over the middle of the field, where his catch radius shines, with Maye looking very comfortable throwing to Hollins.

The veteran wideout finished the regular season third on the team in receptions (46) and fourth in receiving yards (550), while leading all Patriots wide receivers with 657 snaps due to his versatile skill set. Although other factors are involved, such as stingy defenses on the other side, the Patriots offense ranks 10th among 14 playoff teams in EPA per play in the playoffs, compared to a league-best +0.155 EPA per play in the regular season. During their two postseason games, Hollins has been missed, so getting him back for Sunday's championship game in Denver would be a massive boost for the Patriots offense.

As for Landry, the Pats captain tried to play through a knee injury in the postseason, but the injury will cause him to miss Sunday's game. In New England's first two playoff games, Landry has only played 27.4% of the defensive snaps, logging two total pressures and one run stuff. The Patriots have relied on veteran Anfernee Jennings and rookie Elijah Ponder in Landry's left defensive end spot opposite top edge-rusher K'Lavon Chaisson. Although he's a team leader, Jennings and Ponder have been effective filling in for Landry, so one would expect that the Patriots will continue to give the bulk of the snaps to those two.

The other bit of injury news is that starting CB Carlton Davis III cleared the league's concussion protocol on Friday – he's good to go. After intercepting two passes in the first half, Davis exited last week's win over the Texans in the fourth quarter. The Pats starting cornerback practiced in a red non-contact jersey in New England's first two practices but shed the red jersey as a full participant in Friday's practice. On Friday afternoon, Davis was cleared to play on Sunday.

Next, the Patriots might need to do some maneuvering on special teams because of an injury to LB Marte Mapu. Mapu plays on five different special teams units, including serving as the personal protector on punt protection. New England hasn't had a blocked punt this season, with special teams coordinator Jeremy Springer praising Mapu's ability to make the protection calls. If he can't play, the Patriots will need a new personal protector for P Bryce Baringer without Mapu on Sunday.

As for Denver, the Broncos ruled out starting QB Bo Nix (ankle) and backup QB Jarrett Stidham will start, as expected. Along with Nix, top RB J.K. Dobbins, who was attempting to return off injured reserve from a foot injury, was also ruled out by the Broncos. With their lead-back healthy, the Broncos were 10th in rush EPA in the first nine weeks of the season. Without Dobbins, the Broncos are only 22nd in rush EPA since Week 10. Last week, Denver's running backs only rushed 10 times for 41 yards against the Bills. The Broncos also listed starting C Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) and WR Troy Franklin (hamstring) as questionable. On a positive note for the Broncos, WR Pat Bryant cleared concussion protocol and is good to go for Sunday's playoff matchup.

New England could also decide to activate RB Terrell Jennings and DT Joshua Farmer from injured reserve. The first-year running back cleared concussion protocol earlier this week. Before his injury, Jennings was the Patriots third running back and a primary kickoff returner, a role that has gone to veteran RB D'Ernest Johnson in recent weeks. Farmer, a fourth-round draft choice, was a rotational defensive lineman during the regular season. But the Patriots have gotten contributions from DT Leonard Taylor III during the postseason.

With all those eligible to return off injured reserve this week, both teams have until 4 p.m. ET on Saturday to activate them. It's worth noting that the Patriots roster is full, so they'd need to free up a roster spot with a corresponding move. New England can elevate two players from the practice squad by Saturday's deadline, elevations that have gone to Johnson and Taylor in the Patriots first two playoff games.

Harold Landry, who led the Patriots with 8.5 sacks this season, will miss the game in Denver, coach Mike Vrabel said, due to a knee injury that has lingered the last few weeks. Landry didn’t practice this week.

It’s a big blow for a Patriots pass rush that will face a Broncos offensive line that’s among the NFL’s best.

Since the Patriots got healthier on defense at the end of the regular season, their pass rush has greatly improved, and they’ve notched nine sacks this postseason (though none were from Landry). They’ve also blitzed at a higher rate in the playoffs than in the regular season, which could continue with Broncos backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham starting in place of the injured Bo Nix on Sunday.

Nix was one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL at avoiding sacks, but less is known about Stidham’s ability in that area. He has started just four games in the league, but he will benefit from playing behind a great Broncos O-line led by left tackle Garrett Bolles and right guard Quinn Meinerz.

The Patriots’ secondary has been one of the best in the NFL in the second half of the season, and when they’ve combined that with a good pass rush in the playoffs, they’ve been dominant. Now, their pass rush takes a hit without Landry.

Still, Anfernee Jennings has played well in Landry’s place and should see a bump in playing time Sunday. Additionally, the Patriots will ask for more from their interior pass rush with Milton Williams and Christian Barmore in the middle.

The good news from the Patriots on Friday is that wide receiver Mack Hollins is questionable to play after landing on injured reserve at the end of the regular season due to an abdominal injury.

It's the same tune the Seahawks QB sang in the lead up to last week's Divisional Round win over the 49ers after popping up on the injury report following Seattle's final practice, which led to a surprising questionable game status.

Seattle's blowout victory, prompted by a 95-yard return in the opening kickoff by Rashid Shaheed and an outstanding defensive effort, allowed for a stress-free start from Darnold, who completed 12 of 17 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown. By the end of his first career playoff win, Darnold was able to rest on the sideline midway through the fourth quarter, giving backup QB Drew Lock some snaps.

Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said this week that Darnold wouldn't throw every ball on every play in practice this week as a precaution, an effort to ensure Seattle's starting QB is as healthy as possible.

Darnold enters the NFC title game having struggled against the Rams this season, throwing six interceptions in two games.

Gill-Howard won't be back with the Red Raiders next season regardless. He announced on Friday, Jan. 23, he's declaring for this spring's NFL draft.

Shortly afterward, a Texas Tech athletics spokesman said Gill-Howard's waiver request for an additional year of eligibility had been denied by the NCAA. The 2025 season was Gill-Howard's fifth in college football after he spent 2021 at Upper Iowa, an NCAA Division II program, and 2022 through 2024 at Northern Illinois.

Typically, a player can't receive a medically related eligibility clock extension if he's played in more than 30% of his team's regular-season games.

Gill-Howard started the first six games of the 2025 season, his first with Texas Tech after he transferred from NIU. He suffered a lower-leg injury in the first quarter of the Oct. 11 game against Kansas, underwent surgery and didn't play again the rest of the reason. He was credited with 13 tackles, including 2 1/2 tackles for loss and returned an interception 55 yards for a touchdown against Kent State.

In addition to Gill-Howard, Tech loses starting defensive tackle Lee Hunter, who received second-team all-America recognition from the Football Writers Association of America and third-team honors from The Associated Press, and rotation player Dooda Banks. Three other defensive tackles — Amier Washington, Kasen Long and Tanner Allen — have had their names in the NCAA transfer portal this month.

The Red Raiders also will be without returning defensive tackle Jayden Cofield for an indefinite period after he suffered a lower-leg injury on New Year's Day in the Orange Bowl and underwent surgery.

The Tech staff already has been at work this month rebuilding the defensive tackles unit. It has landed four from the transfer portal: Julien Laventure from Akron, Bryce Butler from Washington, Mateen Ibirogba from Wake Forest and JoJo Johnson from Oregon State.

The Red Raiders' returning cast of defensive tackles is headed by second-team All-American A.J. Holmes. The other defensive tackles from the 2025 roster with eligibility remaining are Keyshawn Williams, who'll be a sophomore, and Dylan Singleton, who'll be a redshirt freshman.

Chris Shula's defense has rattled the Seattle Seahawks quarterback.

He's also been sacked 16 times in that span, tied for most.

Four of the second-year safety's six career INTs have come against Seattle. He was asked if the Seahawks are his favorite team to face.

""Yes,"" Kinchens said, ""Because they like to test the secondary. They have good receivers and Sam Darnold wants to throw the ball down the field and push it down the field.

""That's a lot of opportunities, and I love when I get to show people my receiver skills.""

The Rams know that to get a chance at those picks, they must pressure Darnold.

""No rush,"" cornerback Cobie Durant said. ""No picks.""

Darnold, who is dealing with an oblique injury, has been excellent in his first season in Seattle, but pressure can force issues.

Of Darnold's 20 giveaways, 11 came under pressure in 2025 (tied for most with Joe Flacco). Six of the QB's interceptions came under pressure, tied for fourth-most. Per Next Gen Stats, Darnold was pressured on just 29.4 percent of dropbacks, sixth-lowest in the league, but 7.2 percent of those dropbacks under pressure resulted in a giveaway, tops in 2025.

The Rams pressured opponents on 38.0 percent of dropbacks (fifth-highest). In Week 11, they pressured Darnold on 28.9 percent of his dropbacks, with a 33.3 percent rate in Week 16. Per NGS, Darnold had a 26.7 passer rating under pressure against the Rams in 2025, with 5.4 yards per attempt, zero TDs and three INTs. Not under pressure, those numbers leaped to 7.7 YPA, two TDs, three INTs and an 83.2 passer rating.

The Rams acutely used stunts and pressure schemes to rattle Darnold. In the third meeting, Shula knows Seattle will be ready for what he throws at the QB.

Outside linebacker Harold Landry III has been ruled out for the AFC Championship Game after staying sidelined for three consecutive practices due to a lingering knee injury, head coach Mike Vrabel announced Friday.

But wide receiver Mack Hollins, inside linebacker Marte Mapu and cornerback Carlton Davis III will head from Foxborough to Mile High with questionable game statuses.

Here’s the early, final injury report leading up to Sunday’s 3 p.m. ET kickoff at Empower Field.

In 15 games, Landry finished the regular season atop the Patriots with 8.5 sacks and 19 quarterback hits. His 10 tackles for loss also tied for the team lead. But a knee injury has kept the veteran outside linebacker on the injury report since fall met winter. And in the divisional round, after being a non-participant last Friday, he played 11 out of 75 defensive snaps while carrying a questionable game designation.

After staying sidelined for consecutive sessions with a hip issue, Mapu was back for New England’s in-stadium practice. The core linebacker has handled 32 snaps in the kicking game since the start of the postseason, while Davis intercepted the initial two passes of his stay last weekend before entering the NFL’s concussion protocol. The veteran cornerback shed the red non-contact jersey on Friday after being a limited participant for back-to-back practices.

As for the third questionable status, the Patriots opened Hollins’ 21-day practice window midway through Broncos prep. The starting receiver, who went on injured reserve due to an abdomen injury in December, missed four games before joining the limited participants. Leading the depth chart in offensive snaps at the time of his injury, he stood with 46 receptions for 550 yards and two touchdowns.

The conference’s No. 2 seed currently stands with a full 53-man roster. Along with Hollins, running back Terrell Jennings and defensive tackle Joshua Farmer also await potential activations from injured reserve.

When Berube appeared for the Leafs’ morning skate and media availability, he was sporting a heavily swollen black eye. The full extent of the injury wasn’t known until Berube took off his hat to reveal a horrific-looking abrasion on the top of his head that required a dozen stitches. The culprit: “an accident in the gym.”

“The other guy looks way worse. There was three of them,” Berube said, smiling.

The Leafs coach is no stranger to being banged up. Before his coaching career, Berube was a bona fide pugilist and still ranks seventh all-time in NHL penalty minutes.

As for additional details on the gym accident?

“I’m not going to talk about it. Nobody needs to know. It’s all good,” Berube said.

When Berube pulled off his hat, his stitches drew groans from the assembled media.

“It was just a bad accident. It’s on me. My fault. I’m fine,” Berube said.

As is often the case with Berube, he took a lighthearted approach to his injury. He said the players laughed about his stitches and black eye.

“It was stupid,” Berube said of his gym accident.

As the team gathered to stretch at the end of Friday’s morning skate, Berube asked in jest whether they all preferred him to keep his blue Leafs cap on, covering up some of the damage, or take it off. He briefly lifted the hat to show them what they were missing, with a typically big grin.

Berube’s injury will end up being another story on what will be a newsworthy day for the Leafs.

Marner will play his first game in Toronto after nine seasons as a star for the Maple Leafs. After a contentious final season in Toronto, Marner was moved to the Golden Knights as part of a sign-and-trade deal before free agency last year. His return makes for arguably the most anticipated regular-season game for the Leafs this season. A frosty return from Leafs fans inside Scotiabank Arena is a real possibility.

Berube also made news Friday morning when he revealed that he was giving Anthony Stolarz his first start in the Maple Leafs goal since Nov. 11. Stolarz has been out with what he called a nerve issue.

""Arch Manning underwent minor foot surgery this week as a preventative measure to address a previous injury,"" Texas said in a statement. ""He will be limited during off-season workouts but is expected back during spring football.""

After entering the 2024 season as a Heisman Trophy favorite on the preseason No. 1 team, Manning got off to a slow start. However, Manning found his groove in the second half of the season and his numbers reflected a major turnaround. In the last six games, which included wins over Texas A&M and Michigan, Manning completed 62.3% of his passes for 1,714 yards, 14 touchdowns and two interceptions. He also rushed for 206 yards and five scores.

Arch's father, Cooper Manning, recently spoke with CBS Sports and described what it was like to watch his son grow exponentially from Week 1 through bowl season.

""I was really glad to see him get better every week,"" Cooper Manning said. ""I think your confidence grows as you play more games. You learn how to win some games in the fourth quarter, and maybe when you didn't have your best stuff. I think it's fun to watch your kids mature, but it's also fun to watch an athlete mature and start playing their best football as the season ends.""

That late surge has already elevated expectations for the Longhorns' 2026 season. Texas has the third-best odds to win the national championship (+700), tied with Indiana, per FanDuel Sportsbook. When it comes to Heisman Trophy odds, Manning (+800) is tied atop the odds board with Notre Dame quarterback C.J. Carr.

Manning wasn't the only Texas player to undergo a recent surgery. Five other players -- defensive back Xavier Filsaime (shoulder), tackle Trevor Goosby (shoulder), receiver Emmett Mosley V (ankle), linebacker Ty'Anthony Smith (shoulder) and receiver Ryan Wingo (wrist) -- had offseason surgeries but are expected to return in time for the start of the 2026 season. Goosby is a starter at left tackle for the Longhorns while Wingo and Mosley are the team's top two returning receivers.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/23/8179ea70-03e9-4119-9218-cb472c8906e4/thumbnail/1200x675/03e17d185317fa66a26ae8982c869580/gettyimages-2254221595-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 18:00:47.548290

AFC Championship Game New England Patriots (–4.5) at Denver Broncos The hypothetical lookahead line had the Broncos listed as a 1.5-point home favorite.
The Seahawks and Rams have been the two best teams in the NFL for the second half of the season.","Imagine if I told you before the season that the AFC East and AFC West champions would meet in January with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line. You’d nod, ask whether anyone else in the AFC was ever really going to challenge those two heavyweights, and settle in for another instantly memorable duel between Josh Allen’s Bills and Patrick Mahomes’s Chiefs.

Only the Bills and the Chiefs aren’t here.

For the first time in his career as a starter, the AFC championship game isn’t the Patrick Mahomes Invitational. Instead, we were supposed to get something much fresher. A matchup of two second-year quarterbacks trying to lift their teams to a shocking Super Bowl appearance. Bo Nix’s ankle injury has taken the luster out of the Broncos-Patriots matchup a bit, but that won’t stop Jarrett Stidham from trying to channel his inner 2017 Nick Foles. And it won’t stop the Broncos defense from trying to make life miserable for Drake Maye.

Yet the AFC championship game serves as the undercard this weekend. The main event is in the NFC, where the league’s two best teams will have their highly anticipated rubber match.

Let’s dive into these two matchups. All lines are from FanDuel as of Friday morning.

AFC Championship Game

New England Patriots (–4.5) at Denver Broncos

The hypothetical lookahead line had the Broncos listed as a 1.5-point home favorite. Lookahead numbers aren’t a perfect proxy for true market sentiment, but a 6-point adjustment from Bo Nix to Jarrett Stidham still feels aggressive.

Stidham hasn’t played much over the past three seasons as the backup in Denver, but he’s been in the building and is well-versed in Sean Payton’s offense. And while Nix has been serviceable and clutch in late-game situations, he hasn’t exactly been lighting up defenses. He’s averaging just 6.4 yards per attempt—32nd out of 42 qualified quarterbacks. It’s not unreasonable to think that Payton could get similar efficiency out of Stidham—at least for one game.

But that doesn’t mean the two are interchangeable. The real separator between the two isn’t explosive playmaking, but sack avoidance. Nix owns the lowest sack rate in the NFL at 3.5 percent, while Stidham’s career sack rate of 8.8 percent is more than double that.

New England’s defense has been getting after quarterbacks this postseason, but that may be because they faced two truly awful offensive lines in the first two rounds. This matchup presents a very different challenge. Denver boasts an elite offensive line that ranks fifth in pressure rate allowed. If you add that to a potentially run-heavy approach and quick passing game, and if Payton can keep the offense on schedule and keep Stidham upright, it’s hard to justify a downgrade this severe.

On the other side of the ball, the Bills were able to exploit some weaknesses in the heart of the Broncos’ run defense last week. James Cook ran for 117 yards on 24 carries and became the second player this season to run for 100 yards on the Broncos defense. The problem for New England is that they are considerably less set up to exploit that weakness on paper. The Patriots rank 24th in rushing success rate and also struggle with consistency on interior runs. Most of the Patriots’ best run plays have been explosives on the perimeter.

My other concern for New England is pass protection. In a game that projects to be low scoring, avoiding negative plays will be paramount. Maye has made some big-time throws in his first two playoff starts, but he’s also been under constant duress and has not handled that pressure well. This postseason his pressure-to-sack rate is 52.6 percent. That’s more than 20 percentage points higher than any other playoff quarterback. The Texans’ pass rush completely took over the game and Denver’s is just as capable of wreaking havoc and stopping the Patriots offense.

New England has the league’s most efficient downfield passing offense—but now they’ll face a defense that is elite at getting pressure and top four in EPA per dropback allowed against passes 15-plus yards downfield.

The Broncos and Payton will need to get creative if they want to win this game. They can try to rely on the running game, and even get Marvin Mims Jr. active on handoffs. Not only did I bet his over 2.5 rush yards at +120 (we only need one decent carry), but I’m grabbing the points with Denver +4.5.

NFC Championship Game

Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (–2.5)

Whoever wins this game will be a healthy favorite in Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara. The Seahawks and Rams have been the two best teams in the NFL for the second half of the season.

In Week 11, the Rams were a three-point home favorite against the Seahawks. Bettors felt that Los Angeles was a marginally better team, and the Rams won by two. By Week 16 in Seattle, the gap was gone, and the Seahawks were slight 1.5-point home favorites. They won by one in arguably the best game of the entire regular season.

Mike Macdonald’s Seattle defense has continued to smother its opponents—including in two consecutive dominant performances against Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers. If you include the playoffs in the data set, the 2025-26 Seahawks now have the most efficient defense in the league (by EPA per drive) since the start of the 2021 season. They surpassed the 2023 Ravens, whom Macdonald had also coordinated.

The superlatives don’t end there. Seattle has one of the five best rush defenses of the past decade, and because it can get pressure with four rushers, Macdonald doesn’t have to blitz consistently and risk Matthew Stafford carving them open. Because Seattle doesn’t bring a lot of pressure, it usually plays two-high safeties on defense. It’s a main reason why running backs and tight ends have had so many receptions against them, and why I think this is an excellent matchup for the Rams to use their 13 personnel (one back and three tight ends) to generate mismatches in the middle of the field. Rams tight end Colby Parkinson’s receiving yards total is 22.5, and he’s the player I’m betting to go over.

The Seahawks’ biggest advantage on offense all season has been in play-action. They have the third-most efficient play-action offense in the NFL and torched the Rams in both of their meetings with those plays. In the first matchup, Sam Darnold made too many mistakes for the team to overcome. The Rams will have corner Emmanuel Forbes in this game after he left the divisional round with an injury, but they’re vulnerable (22nd in EPA allowed) to play-action.

Even though the Seahawks had a dominant rushing offense the past two games, I suspect that had more to do with their opponents than anything else. The Seahawks still do not have an efficient run offense and will now be without running back Zach Charbonnet as they face the very efficient Rams run defense. Ultimately, I don’t expect either offense to have much success running the ball. We could see some pass-heavy game scripts, which would suggest a higher-scoring matchup than the market is indicating.

These two teams have been roughly equal all year long, and I don’t see much of a difference now. I’d grab the 2.5 points with the Rams if I had to pick a side,and will be betting Parkinson over 22.5 yards, too.

Picks against the spread:

Broncos +4.5

Rams +2.5

With rookie starter Bo Nix's season-ending injury, Denver turned to backup Jarrett Stidham, a move that flipped the Broncos from 1.5-point favorites to 5.5-point underdogs against the New England Patriots.

Stidham, a 2019 fourth-round pick by New England -- who spent 2022 with the Las Vegas Raiders before backing up Russell Wilson and Nix in Denver -- hasn't started a game in more than two years. The Corbin, Kentucky, native is 1-3 as an NFL starter and has passed for 1,422 yards, 8 touchdowns and 8 interceptions in 20 career games played.

But some, namely sports card collectors, are bullish on Stidham's sudden upside. According to Card Ladder, a platform that monitors sports card market trends and sales histories, Stidham has had the largest week-over-week value change of any athlete (min. five cards sold), rising 788.48%. Some collectors engage in ""prospecting,"" or buying as early as possible on players they believe will rise in value, hoping to sell high after on-field performance. But Stidham is a known quantity suddenly thrust into a potentially career-defining circumstance.

On Sunday, Stidham will become only the seventh quarterback since starts began being tracked in 1950 to start a playoff game in a season when he didn't start in the regular season.

Being a heartbeat away from the Super Bowl was enough for one collector to spend $2,000 on a Stidham rookie patch autograph card numbered to three on eBay, mere hours after the Nix injury news broke.

Andrew Arnold, owner of Texas' Beast Sports Cards, sold the card. Arnold told ESPN that he picked up the Stidham card during the Dallas Card Show, which ran Jan. 15-18. Arnold wasn't specifically targeting Stidham cards; it was included in a larger lot of ""older cards"" Arnold bought. When Nix got hurt, Arnold immediately put it up for sale.

""I thought it would sell for $1,000 or so, initially, after he was made the starter,"" Arnold told ESPN. ""But [someone] wanted it badly, so they paid the full asking price.""

It's not the most ever publicly paid for a Stidham card, which was $3,300 in April 2020. According to Card Ladder, Stidham's high public price falls far short of the other three starting quarterbacks' playing this weekend: Sam Darnold's, $10,300 in September 2021; Matthew Stafford's, $55,000 in February 2022; and Drake Maye's, $164,700 in November 2025.

There are currently three 1-of-1 Stidham rookie cards for sale on eBay with six-figure asking prices: the non-autographed 2019 Panini Prizm Black Finite ($500,000 or best offer), the on-card autographed 2019 Panini National Treasures NFL shield card ($450,000 or best offer) and the autographed 2019 Panini Prizm Sensational Signatures Black Finite card ($225,000 or best offer).

If Stidham can take Denver to Super Bowl LX in San Francisco, his market might skyrocket.

""At the end of the day, I'm not focused on anything but Sunday, what is my job on each and every play,"" Stidham said Wednesday. ""How can I help my teammates succeed on Sunday? I don't care about anything else other than the next five days and what my job is.""

Broncos head coach Sean Payton endorsed Stidham in the same news conference.

""He's going to rip it, and that'll be our approach,'' Payton said. ""He's got this calm demeanor that suits him well. ... I felt like our [No.] 2 [quarterback] was inside the best 32 [in the league].""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0101%2Fr1272370_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 16:01:26.137669

These franchises are no strangers to one another in postseason play, and Denver has the upper hand there, owning a 4-1 playoff record against New England, including a perfect 4-0 mark at home.

Those trends certainly favor the Broncos, but Denver finds itself as a rare home playoff underdog as the team was dealt a major injury blow last week during the team's overtime win over the Buffalo Bills. Starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury, so the Broncos are turning to veteran backup Jarrett Stidham. Stidham will make his first start since Week 18 of the 2023 season, and he'll do so against the team that drafted him. That's a tall task against a Patriots team that's seen its defense play exceptionally well this postseason. Plus, New England has one of the game's top quarterbacks in Drake Maye leading the charge on the other side of the ball.

So, who comes out on top in this matchup? That's the question we posed to our staff here at CBS Sports. While you may imagine that New England has the advantage due to the Nix injury, it was not a clean sweep in favor of the Patriots. Check out who our staff has winning the AFC Championship.

Where to watch Patriots vs. Broncos live

Date: Sunday, Jan. 25 | Time: 3 p.m. ET

Location: Empower Field at Mile High (Denver)

TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+

Odds: Patriots -4.5, O/U 42.5 (odds via DraftKings Sportsbook)

Pete Prisco: I know the Broncos are playing Jarett Stidham for the injured Bo Nix, but Sean Payton will have a plan to make it work and the defense will limit Drake Maye. Broncos to the Super Bowl. Broncos 23, Patriots 21

Tyler Sullivan: The air was taken out of the balloon with this matchup after Bo Nix went down with an ankle injury. Jarrett Stidham has a nice revenge narrative set up for himself as he faces the team that drafted him, but New England's defense should engulf him. So long as Drake Maye protects the football, New England should be back in the Super Bowl. Patriots 24, Broncos 17

John Breech: Drake Maye struggled against one of the best defenses in the NFL last week, and now, he has to once again play one of the best defenses in the NFL, except this time, he has to go on the road. Maye has taken a beating this postseason (he's been sacked 10 times in two games) and it could get worse in Denver where he'll be facing a Broncos defense that recorded the FIFTH-MOST sacks in a single season in NFL history. I have no idea how the Patriots offensive line is going to stop the Broncos' pass-rush. I think Denver will keep this closer than most people are expecting, but New England steals the win. Patriots 20, Broncos 17.

Jordan Dajani: The football gods love Mike Vrabel. His Patriots got to play the easiest strength of schedule since 1999, then took on a hapless Chargers team in the wild-card round followed by the turnover addict C.J. Stroud in the divisional round. Who awaits New England in the conference championship? Jarrett Stidham. Patriots 23, Broncos 17 .

Garrett Podell: New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye led the NFL in completion percentage, yards per pass attempt, passer rating, completion percentage over expected and expected points added (EPA) per dropback in 2025 while fill-in Denver Broncos starting quarterback Jarrett Stidham hasn't thrown a pass all season. Patriots 27, Broncos 13.

Bryan DeArdo: Picking the Patriots feels like a cop out given Bo Nix's injury. But even if Nix was playing, the Patriots would likely still be my pick because of their running game, which should help Drake Maye conquer Denver's mighty defense. Patriots 20, Broncos 10.

J.P. Acosta: I think the Broncos have the ability defensively to make the Pats' life difficult on the offensive side of the ball, but a resurgent Patriots' defense takes advantage of a Nix-less Broncos offense and goes to the Super Bowl. Patriots 21, Broncos 17.

Zach Pereles: The Bo Nix injury is a huge bummer not only for the Broncos, but for any neutral observer; we want to see teams at as close to full strength as possible this late in the season. Still, don't expect this to become some blowout, considering the Broncos have the pass rush to disrupt Drake Maye (who's taken 10 sacks in two postseason games), and Jarrett Stidham likely won't throw four interceptions like C.J. Stroud did. Patriots 20, Broncos 17.

Joel Corry: Losing Bo Nix is too much for the Broncos to overcome. Patriots 27, Broncos 17.

Kyle Stackpole: Jarrett Stidham was one of Sean Payton's first free agent signings after he arrived in Denver in 2023, choosing to play for Payton over other options. He has known Davis Webb -- the team's offensive pass game coordinator and quarterbacks coach -- since he was a teenager. Does any of this mean he'll play well enough to lift Denver to the Super Bowl? No. But wouldn't it be an amazing story if he did? Broncos 24, Patriots 21

Mike Renner: The Patriots look poised to slop their way to the Super Bowl. Both offensive lines look like they'll be overmatched in this one, but Drake Maye has proven that won't stop him from still making plays.

Tax implications and apron restrictions turn every proposition into a jigsaw puzzle. And that’s before you throw in actual outgoing talent and what every potential buyer needs. Alas, with the deadline less than two weeks away, I’ve bravely taken it upon myself to try to do the impossible. Here are a few compelling hypotheticals that are, at the very least, worth arguing over.

Are the Knicks ready for a Karl-Anthony Towns divorce?

Coming off a magical playoff run in 2025, New York was a popular preseason pick to reach this season’s Finals. Its broad array of high-end complementary talent inspired the most Knicks optimism in decades, particularly with the East being more diluted than usual. (Tyrese Haliburton isn’t around to re-create their darkest nightmare.) But for all the offensive options New York has at its disposal—seemingly unleashed in a more egalitarian system—the inherent flaws that ultimately cut last season short still exist. Last week’s loss against the broken Dallas Mavericks was rock botto for a group that ranks 24th since Christmas in defensive rating, struggles to get stops when its two best players are on the court, and is 3-9 in its past 12 games.

The championship-caliber dynamic duo of Karl-Anthony Towns and Jalen Brunson hasn’t hit the point of no return yet, but one of these two is familiar with seeing his name in trade rumors and can realistically be moved before this deadline. Towns is not the All-NBA big man he was last season. His 3-point percentage has not been this low since he was a rookie. His 2-point percentage is teetering into a ditch, particularly at the rim. The Karate Kid routine against Dallas was almost like a subconscious temper tantrum to release whatever frustrations Towns has felt in new head coach Mike Brown’s system all season long. This doesn’t mean KAT is bad. He’s on the bubble of making his second straight All-Star team, and in competitive minutes, New York is better on both ends when he’s on the court. But, for all the reasons listed above, a breakup may benefit both parties.

Trading him obviously won’t be simple. The Knicks must connect with a team that is interested in Towns, has the contracts to make the deal, and has the type of surrounding talent that will bring New York closer to a Finals appearance. From the outside looking in, it is definitely easier for KAT to work things out with Brown and arrive at some kind of détente. Towns is 30 years old and guaranteed $118 million over the next two season Rumored suitors, like Charlotte, Memphis, and Orlando, either can’t cobble together a package that will grab New York’s attention or don’t have the money to make anything legally work without involving a third team. Enter: a franchise that might not be thinking with a clear head.

Milwaukee Bucks receive: Karl-Anthony Towns

New York Knicks receive: Myles Turner, Kyle Kuzma, and a top-five protected pick in 2031

If your first reaction to this was “That makes no sense,” you are 100 percent correct. A blockbuster trade between New York and Milwaukee that doesn’t include an increasingly melodramatic Giannis Antetokounmpo would belie rational thought. The Bucks should absolutely not do this. But the Bucks should absolutely not have done a bunch of other stuff they thought was a good idea, so let’s operate in that reality for a minute.

New York (marginally) upgrades on defense without sacrificing all the space Towns is able to create as a 3-point-shooting center, and the Bucks receive a vastly superior offensive threat who can prop up their attack when Giannis isn’t on the floor and [chokes back laughter] maybe even give them a puncher’s chance to escape the play-in. Say what you want: Towns is a physically imposing star whose exact skill set is a key ingredient for any team that wants to maximize Antetokounmpo (who lives in the paint and can’t shoot).

If Giannis ultimately refuses to sign an extension this summer, I’d rather have Towns than Turner and Kuzma. The Knicks, meanwhile, add some financial flexibility (Turner will make about $30 million less than Towns in 2028) and get a pretty good asset for the trouble. Their odds to reach the Finals this season would probably dip a little bit, but there’s a definite world where those two work better in New York’s existing rotation. It also opens the door for more trade scenarios over the summer.

To be clear, no sane general manager in the league should give up a first-round pick to take on Towns’s contract. But the Bucks have been operating in an upside-down universe for the past six months. Why not triple down on the mess they’ve made and see what happens?

While we’re talking about the Knicks, if you happen to root for them and have a low tolerance for pain, feel free to cover your eyes and scroll down to the next trade. I know how untenable it would be to even gauge Brunson’s trade value—he’s an All-Star starter who took a pay cut so New York could build a championship-level roster around him—but actually winning it all may not be possible so long as he’s the team’s best player. My mind wanders. What could they get for him? This would almost definitely never happen, but if it did, Knicks fans would absolutely storm Madison Square Garden. When Brunson is on the court, New York’s offensive rating is 8.1 points per 100 possessions above the league average. The only players who rank above him play for the Denver Nuggets.

But he’s also an increasingly problematic defender who will turn 30 in August and seems to be walking off an ankle injury once a week. For the second season in a row, the Knicks have a bad defense when he’s on the court regardless of whether Towns is out there. (Meanwhile, for the second season in a row, the Knicks have a good defense when Towns is on the court without Brunson.)

There may be a path to the Finals that doesn’t go through the player with such a paradoxical impact. As great and beloved as Brunson is, winning a championship with him as your best player is an exceptional challenge—like having the most powerful left hook in the world but stepping into the ring with your right arm tied behind your back. In last year’s playoffs, he ranked first in offensive estimated plus-minus and last in defensive plus-minus. The Knicks obviously aren’t even thinking about cashing out right now, but what if they disappoint during the playoffs? What if there’s a deal out there that can shore up New York’s defense and give the team a ton of draft equity without drowning the offense? Say, something along the lines of Fred VanVleet, Dorian Finney-Smith, and six first-round picks? That sounds ludicrous. Maybe it is! Even if New York’s defensive issues are never resolved with Brunson on the roster, he’s a floor-raising, messianic figure with a universally positive approval rating.

Watching him is fun. It’s an unavoidable dilemma.

The Thunder shouldn’t get cute with their title defense.

Chicago Bulls receive: Ousmane Dieng, Philadelphia’s 2026 top-four-protected pick, and Denver’s 2026 top-five-protected pick

Oklahoma City Thunder receive: Ayo Dosunmu

The pick compensation here sounds like a lot, but it’s actually not that stee when you consider the stakes. Championship windows in the NBA are unpredictable and unforgiving. Even when the runway looks clear and there isn’t a cloud in the sky, the opportunity to acquire a dynamic downhill driver who’s also been one of the better 3-point shooters this season should not be taken for granted.

OKC can afford to take chances—or can’t afford not to, depending on how you look at it—especially under these circumstances. Let’s consider the picks it would give up. The Sixers are pretty good and currently in line to receive the 18th pick in this year’s draft. The Nuggets will pick somewhere in the 20s next year. The Thunder, meanwhile, have Nikola Topic and Thomas Sorber—their two most recent first-round picks—waiting in the wings, and they own the Clippers’ first-round pick in this year’s draft with swap rights in next year’s draft, swap rights with the Dallas Mavericks in 2028, another protected first from Denver in 2029, and approximately 6 million second-round picks incoming from half the league.

There’s always risk as a small-market team surrendering draft capital for a short-term gain (OKC can’t realistically re-sign Dosunmu with Chet Holmgren’s and Jalen Williams’s extensions kicking in next year). But by doing this trade, the Thunder can stay under the tax (not for nothing, considering how close they are to that line and the amount of belt tightening that’s to come) and exchange someone who will never see meaningful minutes in the playoffs for a solid two-way player who’s talented enough to win them a game. Instead of losing Dieng for zilch this summer, they can grab Dosunmu and lessen the downside of another Jalen Williams injury.

If you’re the Bulls, just smile and say thank you. Draft capital and young talent are exactly what this organization is starved for. Dieng is four years younger than Dosunmu and, with both being on expiring contracts, will almost definitely cost a whole lot less going forward.

Should the Celtics make a win-now move?

This isn’t the sexiest name out there, but if the Brooklyn Nets put Day'Ron Sharpe on the trade market, there’s a very good chance they’ll have a bidding war on their hands. The Celtics, Rockets, Lakers, and Raptors are four playoff teams off the top of my head that could really use an inexpensive depth piece to bolster their frontcourts. Sharpe is a magnet for offensive rebounds, sets terrific screens, is comfortable as a hub on the perimeter, and can really see the floor. Few backup bigs are better at making quick reads out of a short roll or turning a second-chance opportunity into a wide-open 3-pointer.

Boston’s odds of making a lengthy playoff run would improve if Sharpe were its backup center. (With all due respect to Luka Garza, there’s a decent chance he’ll get played off the floor in the postseason.) Houston needs some insurance for Steven Adams, and Sharpe is a perfect fit with its crash-the-glass mentality. L.A. is … unserious with Deandre Ayton and Jaxson Hayes. Toronto can’t leave Jakob Poeltl’s back pain to chance.

Like I said, a potential bidding war. Here’s my favorite hypothetical:

Boston Celtics receive: Day’Ron Sharpe and Ziaire Williams

Brooklyn Nets receive: Anfernee Simons and three second-round picks

The on-court upgrade matters a ton, but don’t overlook the financial implications: By doing this, the Celtics duck the luxury tax without hemorrhaging the type of talent that can really help in the playoffs. Simons isn’t bad, but his value will shrink considerably when Jayson Tatum returns; there’s no evidence that he’ll even be playable on the defensive end in a seven-game series.

Now, the Rockets can probably blow this offer out of the water with all the picks and swaps they own (including a swap with the Nets in 2027), but how far would they go here for a backup big with Clint Capela already on the roster? Do the Lakers actually want to win this season? Do the Raptors believe they can? Sharpe is 24 years old and very good at what he does. Someone should go get him. Boston is good enough to try.

The Pistons need to act like the contenders they are.

Detroit Pistons receive: Michael Porter Jr. and Haywood Highsmith

Brooklyn Nets receive: Tobias Harris, Jaden Ivey, and an unprotected first-round pick in 2028

I was a little jealous when my boss Bill Simmons first mentioned Michael Porter Jr. as a logical trade target for the Pistons earlier this month. He’s somehow become the Eastern Conference’s version of Lauri Markkanen, an awesome player whom, since the offseason, I’ve all but begged Detroit to pursue. Fast-forward a few months, and the price for Markkanen is almost definitely too high for a Jazz team that’s starting to gain traction with an intriguing young core. Enter Porter, an A-plus-plus 3-point shooter who accentuates teammates without needing the ball. And unlike Markkanen, he’s logged more than zero seconds of playoff basketball as the third-leading scorer and rebounder on a team that won the championship.

The phrase “all in” is thrown around quite a bit, often incorrectly. This situation certainly doesn’t qualify. The Pistons would part with a reliable veteran and excellent locker-room presence on an expiring contract, an intriguing recent lottery pick who had two major surgeries in a year and hasn’t been a major contributor to this season’s success, and one future first-round pick. That’s not nothing. It also doesn’t come close to eliminating flexibility from a team that owns all of its picks. What it would do, probably, is catapult Detroit’s payroll past the first apron for a player with a checkered injury history. But when you’re a young title contender sitting atop a down conference, shoot your shot. Fortune favors the bold!

All signs point to Detroit being patient at the deadline, and I can understand that logic. As my colleague Zach Lowe said on his podcast earlier this week, the Pistons can do nothing and still reach the Finals. The East is that weak, and patience is typically a mindset I won’t argue with. But I also hope this team isn’t comparing itself to where the Oklahoma City Thunder were a couple of years ago, finishing breakfast as a 1-seed that was eliminated by the Maverick in Round 2. The Pistons ate breakfast a year ago when they nearly beat the Knicks in an extremely competitive first-round slugfest—sans Isaiah Stewart and Ivey!

They should know who they are and what they have. Regular-season dominance does not always guarantee playoff malleability. Porter is not a high-usage ball handler or a traditional second option. What he is, though, is someone who directly assuages Detroit’s primary concern. What this team needs to seriously compete in the playoffs is more shooting. Porter can check off that box with permanent ink. He’s shooting 39.8 percent behind the arc on 9.5 attempts per game. That’s ridiculous on its own, but it gets even more impressive when you learn that 68.7 percent of his catch-and-shoot jumpers are tightly contested, per Sportradar. That puts him in the 100th percentile and helps explain why he ranks seventh in overall gravity.

MPJ can grease the wheels for humongous lineups that will encounter serious spacing issues throughout a seven-game series. Imagine him with Cade Cunningham, Ausar Thompson, Jalen Duren, and Isaiah Stewart. That five-man unit rules. Or you can replace Ausar or Beef Stew with Duncan Robinson and watch Cade frolic through the paint with more room than he’s ever had in his life. Brooklyn’s offensive rating sits in the top 10 with Porter on the court and falls several points below the last-ranked Indiana Pacers when he’s out. That gap makes him one of the most positive difference-makers in the league this season, sandwiched between Donovan Mitchell and Jalen Brunson. (It also puts him just in front of Robinson, which isn’t a coincidence. The Pistons average the fifth-fewest 3s per 100 possessions.)

Given how great MPJ has been this season, there may be better offers out ther but turning Cam Johnson into two unprotected first-round picks, Harris, and Ivey would be a staggeringly impressive sequence of events for a rebuilding team.",https://wp.theringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cropped-KatMustGo_Getty-Ringer-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 15:00:44.439164

Darnold averaged 39 attempts in the first two meetings against the Rams' defense this year.","RENTON, Wash. -- Sam Darnold got sacked, then got up gingerly.

His head coach got nervous.

It was late in the first quarter of Seattle's divisional round matchup against the San Francisco 49ers last Saturday at Lumen Field, and it might have been the only tense moment the Seahawks experienced in a 41-6 win that got them into Sunday's NFC Championship Game against the Los Angeles Rams (6:30 p.m. ET, Fox).

Darnold was playing through an oblique injury he had suffered two days earlier.

The Seahawks and their Pro Bowl quarterback were confident that he'd play despite his questionable designation. But no one could be sure how he'd fare while dealing with the first oblique injury of his career -- or what would happen if he took a bad hit.

Almost 11 minutes into the game, Darnold rolled to his right on a bootleg, then broke into a sprint as a 49ers defender gave chase. When safety Malik Mustapha dropped him from behind, he hit the ground hard, and he appeared to be feeling it as he jogged back to the huddle.

On the next play, Darnold delivered a strike to Cooper Kupp for a 21-yard gain, putting enough zip on the ball to drive it almost 37 yards in the air, and enough touch to layer it over an underneath zone defender.

""That was awesome,"" coach Mike Macdonald said of the throw. ""At that point, I think I exhaled a little bit.""

Darnold would go on to play a mistake-free game, completing 12 of 17 attempts for 124 yards and a touchdown before he was pulled with over nine minutes left. The first playoff victory of his career came two weeks after a 13-3 win over the 49ers in Week 18, which gave the Seahawks a first-round bye as NFC West champions and the conference's No. 1 seed.

Now comes the biggest game of Darnold's career against perhaps his toughest opponent -- with a ticket to Super Bowl LX on the line.

It was the Rams' defense, coordinated by Chris Shula, that sacked Darnold nine times in the wild-card round last January, ending his breakthrough Pro Bowl season with the Minnesota Vikings. Shula's unit then intercepted him four times in the Rams' win over Seattle in November, and twice more in a December rematch before Darnold and the Seahawks rallied to win in overtime.

In four games against the Rams over the past two seasons, Darnold has 5 touchdown passes, 7 interceptions, 16 sacks and a 1-3 record. He has a Total QBR of 34.3 in those games -- his second worst among the 11 opponents he has faced at least twice in that span -- compared with 58.4 in every other game since the start of 2024.

Can Darnold, injured oblique and all, help beat his nemesis a second straight time to put the Seahawks back in the Super Bowl for the first time in 11 years?

""Really good team, really good defense, really good scheme,"" Darnold said. ""Good players. So like always, we're really excited about this opportunity to play these guys. We've just got to have a really good week of practice. For me, I've got to continue to attack all the things that I need to attack, just get ready to play these guys, but also just getting my body right to be ready for Sunday.""

ROUND 1

Darnold's four interceptions in the Seahawks' 21-19 loss against the Rams at SoFi Stadium in Week 11 had one thing in common: They all came under duress.

On the first pick, by safety Kamren Kinchens, Darnold retreated in the pocket and then threw off his back foot to Cooper Kupp. On the next one, he got drilled by outside linebacker Byron Young as he was releasing a throw to Jaxon Smith-Njigba that cornerback Cobie Durant picked off. Kinchens got him a second time as he was trying to hit tight end Elijah Arroyo with the pocket collapsing around him. Darnold attempted a jump throw to Arroyo after navigating another messy pocket when cornerback Darious Williams nabbed interception No. 4.

Darnold wasn't sacked in that game, which may have illustrated the problem. Whether or not he was overly intent on avoiding sacks after taking nine of them against the Rams 10 months earlier -- as Kinchens surmised afterward -- pressure was the common denominator on his four interceptions.

That pressure, combined with the Rams disguising certain looks on the back end of their defense, gave Darnold fits. Afterward, he said he needed to do a better job of recognizing their shell coverages and moving on in his progressions as opposed to locking on to one or two receivers. But the Rams' pass rush made that easier said than done.

""They do a good job of disguising shell [alignment] and all those things,"" Darnold said. ""I feel like their pass rush, their linebackers, their safeties all being on the same page and playing really good football, they do it at a high level. They seem like really smart players. But again, those are self-inflicted wounds, turning the ball over like that. Sometimes it's better just to try to throw the ball away or even take a sack when nothing is there.""

The Seahawks' top-ranked scoring defense kept them in the game long enough for Darnold to mount a comeback. He led an 11-play, 84-yard touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter that got them to within two points. Then, after they took over at their own 1-yard line with one timeout and 1:41 left, he got them in position for a 61-yard field goal that would have won the game as time expired, but Jason Myers missed. Darnold completed 6 of 9 attempts for 43 yards on that drive, which also included a defensive penalty.

""I think that's why he's had such a really good season, because he's the same guy every day,"" offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said. ""Whether he's having success or it's not going as good, he's always the same. He's really impressive on the sideline and ready to move on. That's why he is who he is, and that's how most great quarterbacks are, they just stay the same.""

The Seahawks have not lost since then -- but it took an improbable comeback in the second Rams meeting to keep that streak going.

ROUND 2

The two interceptions Darnold threw in the Week 16 rematch had something else in common.

In the third quarter, cornerback Josh Wallace had followed Kupp in motion into the left slot, often a tell of man coverage. Kupp and outside receiver Rashid Shaheed both ran slant routes from that side of the field. But instead of running with Kupp, Wallace settled right in the path of Darnold's throw to Shaheed.

In the fourth quarter, with the Seahawks facing third-and-goal from the 6-yard line and threatening to cut into the Rams' 16-point lead, Darnold got fooled again. This time, it was by defensive lineman Kobie Turner, who dropped into coverage and picked off Darnold's throw into the end zone to Smith-Njigba.

""They do a lot of really good things defensively,"" Darnold said this week. ""Their scheme is really good. Coach Shula, those guys do a good job coaching those guys up on what to do ... The players make it come to life with certain disguises and pressures.""

What followed Darnold's second interception was a furious comeback from a 30-14 deficit and a wild finish that made Seattle's 38-37 win one of the games of the year.

It started with a punt return touchdown from Shaheed. Seattle's defense, in the midst of allowing 581 yards -- its most in two seasons under Macdonald -- got stops on five straight possessions. Darnold threw a touchdown pass to tight end AJ Barner and converted 2-point attempts after both scores to send the game to overtime, the second one coming when running back Zach Charbonnet grabbed what turned out to be a live ball in the end zone, as other players were walking off the field thinking Darnold's screen pass had fallen incomplete.

Darnold then answered Matthew Stafford's overtime touchdown drive with one of his own, hitting Smith-Njigba in the end zone from 4 yards out. He then won the game with a 2-point conversion to No. 2 tight end Eric Saubert. Darnold completed 4 of 5 attempts for 47 yards on the game-winning drive, plus the 2-point try.

It was the largest fourth-quarter comeback in franchise history, according to ESPN Research. The Seahawks were 0-155-0 when trailing by 16-plus points after three quarters.

""Just shows a true competitor,"" Smith-Njigba said of Darnold. ""A lot of guys would get down on themselves and give up, lay down, but that's not what we do, that's not what he is.""

ROUND 3

Leading up to Sunday's game, the Seahawks listed Darnold as a limited participant in practice Wednesday and Thursday.

Darnold made it clear after the 49ers game last week that he'd ""absolutely"" have to continue to manage his oblique injury, while Macdonald said his throwing would be curtailed this week to that end.

But Kubiak said Thursday, ""He looks like Sam. He looks healthy to me.""

Darnold averaged 39 attempts in the first two meetings against the Rams' defense this year. If the pattern follows, Darnold and his oblique will get more of a test on Sunday than what the 49ers and their shorthanded defense presented last week when Darnold threw 17 times before sitting with the game in hand.

Limiting mistakes against the Rams will be paramount, given how close the two previous games against the Rams have been.

According to ESPN Research, this NFC Championship Game will be the first playoff game in NFL history between teams that played two games against each other in the regular season that were each decided by two points or fewer. The Seahawks combined for 57 points and 830 yards in those matchups, nearly identical totals to the Rams' 58 points and 829 yards.

Darnold and the Seahawks, who enter as 2.5-point favorites, will have the advantage of playing at home. Seattle is 11-1 in playoff games at Lumen Field in the past 20 years. The only loss in that span came to the Rams at the end of the 2020 COVID season, when Seattle had no fans in the stands.

But with a trip to Super Bowl LX on the line, the decibel levels -- and the pressure -- will be high.

""It's the NFC Championship, so two best teams in the NFC going at it,"" Darnold said. ""It's a really good opportunity to just play good football, have that kind of next-opponent, next-game mentality. We know the stakes ... It's win or go home at this point.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0122%2Fr1604218_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 15:00:48.155806

Bo Nix had just suffered a serious ankle injury that’s expected to end his rookie season, but Payton showed no hesitation in shifting focus to Stidham.

Kyle Brandt says Sean Payton’s ‘just watch’ moment could become legendary

Speaking on NFL Network’s Good Morning Football, Kyle Brandt said the speech already feels like it could become part of league folklore — especially if Jarrett Stidham thrives in his new role under Sean Payton.

The Denver Broncos face a challenge few teams ever have – competing in the AFC championship game without their starting quarterback.

“I am riveted watching back that Sean Payton speech. It’s been a week now. I found myself watching it, and he’s sitting up there… This is that night! After the game! In the stadium! He just found out the news!”

“It’s an incredible display of poise and confidence. This has potential to be an all-time moment. This has potential to be looked back on as the ‘just watch’ speech. This could age incredibly…”

“There’s nothing about him that is stressed… It’s almost like he was expecting it, or has been expecting it. Have you ever seen someone who found out their franchise quarterback look so calm and cool?…”

“If Jarrett Stidham goes on to do something very special, that speech will go up with the all-timers… I’m getting goosebumps right now. If there is a Jarrett Stidham movie, I will go see it. It starts this weekend.”

Sean Payton’s calm reaction earns league-wide praise

Sean Payton’s calm handling of the situation has drawn praise across the NFL. Even with playoff hopes hanging in the balance, the Denver Broncos coach projected belief in Jarrett Stidham, who now leads the team into the most critical stretch of the season.

If Jarrett Stidham guides the Broncos to a strong finish, the moment could be remembered as one of the most defining in Denver’s modern history.

The Broncos now face the challenge of overcoming the New England Patriots, led by second-year quarterback Drake Maye and one of the league’s top defensive units.

Dak Prescott, quarterback 15.","The Associated Press released its awards finalists Thursday, and great news for Dallas Cowboys fans, quarterback Dak Prescott was on it for good reasons.

The bad news is that he's not a candidate for MVP, which happens when a team goes 7-9-1. He's a finalist for comeback player of the year, which is what happens a year after a major injury. The award finalists, however, did offer a good guess as to who will be the MVP this year and not surprisingly, he's playing this Sunday in a conference championship game.

And the Cowboys have a new defensive coordinator, raiding their rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles, to find him.

Dak Prescott comeback player

Dak Prescott is a finalist for one of the major NFL postseason awards: Associated Press Comeback Player of the Year.

The other finalists are New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, Detroit Lions defensive end Aidan Hutchinson, Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffery.

The award typically goes to someone coming back from a major injury, and Prescott fits that bill. Last season he played in eight games before a season-ending injury, then came back this season with one of his best years ever.

He was also a finalist for this award in 2021 when he returned from a horrific ankle injury suffered in 2020. In 2021, he was a runner-up to Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow.

Dak Prescott stats

This season, Prescott was 404-of-600 passing for 4,552 yards with 30 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He also added 177 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. The yards ranked him third in the NFL and his QBR of 70.3 ranked him fifth.

Dallas Cowboys awards

Of the eight NFL postseason awards presented by the Associated Press, Dallas' only representative is Dak Prescott as comeback player of the year. The other categories are MVP, offensive player of the year, defensive player of the year, offensive rookie of the year, defensive rookie of the year, assistant coach of the year and coach of the year.

Notably, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, the clear betting favorite to win MVP, was not a finalist for offensive player of the year. The same player can't win both awards, and the offensive player of the year is usually a chance to give the award to a non-quarterback, as quarterbacks almost always win MVP.

In fact, the only quarterback to be nominated for offensive player of the year was the New England Patriots' Drake Maye. Translation: Stafford is almost certainly the MVP, and Maye finished second in the MVP voting, which was conducted at the regular season's end.

NFL MVP: Which Cowboys rank in top 100?

The five MVP finalists the Associated Press announced were four quarterbacks (Los Angeles Rams Matthew Stafford, New England Patriots Drake May, Buffalo Bills Josh Allen, Jacksonville Jaguars Trevor Lawrence) and San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffery.

Here is the full list of award finalists.

ESPN's Seth Walder has a very different take and an annual ranking of his top 100, led by Drake Maye. Second? That would be Dak Prescott, who is one of five Cowboys to make the list.

They are:

2. Dak Prescott, quarterback

15. George Pickens, wide receiver

29 Quinnen Williams, defensive tackle

76. Tyler Smith, offensive tackle

79. CeeDee Lamb, receiver

Worth noting, former Dallas edge rusher Micah Parsons, now with Green Bay, ranked 12th despite playing just 14 games.

Dallas Cowboys new defensive coordinator

On Thursday, the Cowboys hired Christian Parker away from the Philadelphia Eagles. He was the pass-game coordinator and defensive backs coach.

Parker began coaching in the NFL in 2019 after six years in the college ranks, starting with Green Bay as a defensive quality control coach for two years before going to Denver as a defensive backs coach in 2021.

Under Parker, Philadelphia ranked first in passing yards allowed in 2024 while giving up 22 passing touchdowns, sixth-fewest in the NFL, and this past season finished eighth in passing yards allowed and first in passing TDs surrendered (14).

Vic Fangio

Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio got good news and bad news Thursday. The good news is that he's one of five finalists for the NFL Assistant of the Year Award. The bad news is that he lost one of his top assistants, passing game coordinator Christian Parker, to the divisional rival Cowboys and now will have to face him as a fellow defensive coordinator.

The other finalists for top NFL assistant are Vikings DC Brian Flores, Minnesota, Broncos DC Vance Joseph, Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak and Patriots OC Josh McDaniels.

The 29-year-old quarterback was an early free agent signing that offseason after Payton came on board. Little did they know then that the veteran signal calling, who has not thrown an NFL pass in over two seasons, would be the one who could help get them to a Super Bowl.

""Stiddy's been waiting for this moment for the entirety of his career,"" said Broncos offensive tackle Mike McGlinchey. ""He's more prepared than anybody would be in this situation. And he can ball, he can flat out play quarterback. We've seen it every day in practice. We've seen it in training camp.

""I have no doubts he's going to go out there and play his butt off.""

Bo Nix is out for the rest of the season with a broken bone in his ankle.

It'll be up to Stidham to navigate Denver past the New England Patriots, the team he was drafted by in 2019 and spent his first three NFL seasons.

While a long shot, Broncos running back J.K. Dobbins, how since Week 10 with a foot injury, has been limited in practice this week.

The Patriots don't have any major injury concerns, but could potentially get back Mack Hollins. The wide receiver has missed four games with an abdominal injury, but the team designated him for return from injured reserve this week. Hollins was limited during Thursday's practice.

One concern was defensive tackle Christian Barmore, whose previous issues with blood clots could have been an issue in the thin Denver air. But head coach Mike Vrabel said it should not be a problem.

""Certainly something we have to monitor,"" Vrabel said. ""There are some players that we'll have to monitor for one reason or another, but I don't see any limitations for Christian.""

While the Seattle Seahawks will be down running back Zach Charbonnet after he tore his ACL last week, quarterback Sam Darnold (oblique) and tackle Charles Cross (foot) should be fine to play. Darnold was limited on Thursday, while Cross did not take part.

The teams split their two regular-season meetings, with the home team winning each time. The Seahawks are 2.5-point favorites, with DraftKings setting the Over/Under at 46.5. Seattle is a -154 favorite, and Los Angeles is priced as a +129 money-line underdog.

Here, we will break down the NFL Conference Championships odds and how they have been affected since lines first opened, with odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.

Patriots vs. Broncos (Sunday, 3 p.m. ET)

Open: Patriots -5.5, O/U 40.5

Now: Patriots -4.5, O/U 42.5

Denver is covering in 58% of the SportsLine model's simulations. Bet the spread at DraftKings:

The Broncos are going to have to win with a strong running game and a great defense, as Jarrett Stidham will be stepping in for Nix, and the sixth-year pro has just four career starts. The good news is that running back RJ Harvey has 896 total yards at 12 total TDs in his rookie season, and J.K. Dobbins (772 rushing yards in 10 games) has been practicing on a limited basis after a long IR stint. The better news is the Denver defense led the league in sacks in the regular season with 68 (four per game) and has been the driving force for this team all season. The bad news is that New England has one of the NFL's best run defenses, ranking fifth at 101.7 yards per game in the regular season. The Patriots also had the second-highest scoring offense, averaging 28.8 points per game. But the Broncos had the third-best scoring defense (18.3) and are going to make life tough on Pats QB Drake Maye. The fans at Mile High are sure to do their part as well. The SportsLine model is expecting more from the Broncos than oddsmakers are, with Denver covering the spread 58% of the time and winning outright 46% of the time. At a price of +204, the model loves the Broncos on the money line, giving the pick an ""A"" grade. The public has been hitting the Patriots hard, with about 75% of spread bets at DraftKings on New England, dropping the spread to 4.5. The total has bumped up, moving two points with the public likely expecting the Stidham-led offense to provide more chances for Maye and the Pats to add points.

Rams at Seahawks (Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET)

Open: Seahawks -2.5, O/U 47.5

Now: Seahawks -2.5, O/U 46.5

Seattle is covering in 58% of the SportsLine model's simulations. Bet the spread at DraftKings:

The Seahawks are the favorite to win the Super Bowl, so they're favored here. From past experiences, if they can avoid turnovers they should have no problem beating the Rams again. They gave the ball away seven times in the two regular-season meetings but won the matchup in Seattle and missed a 61-yard field goal that would have won the game in L.A. One question is which type of game this will be, as the first was a 21-19 nail-biter and the second was a 38-37 OT thriller. The Rams had 249 total yards in their home victory but piled up 581 in the second meeting. Seattle had 415 at home and 414 in L.A., so it looks like we know what to expect from the Seahawks offense against a Rams defense that has had some problems. L.A. averaged 30.5 points in the regular season, most in the NFL, but Seattle was third at 28.4. The Seahawks defense allowed the fewest points in the league (17.2) while the Rams were 10th (20.4). The SportsLine model is leaning slightly Under the total, with simulations projecting 46 total points, and has Seattle covering 58% of the time for an ""A"" grade. At DraftKings, 83% of the spread bets and 91% of the handle are on Seattle, while 69% of bettors are on the Over.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/22/153dbba6-2eab-41ae-aa3c-b84ddb0fd16c/thumbnail/1200x675/9e5297d9a50e5224370f7208576bb44e/broncos-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 11:42:15.494323

No, not Jarrett Stidham.

Running back J.K. Dobbins. He has been out with a foot injury since Nov. 6 but returned to practice this week. He has been sorely missed, as rookie RJ Harvey has a total of 91 yards rushing on 35 carries in the past three games. Dobbins led the Broncos in rushing in the regular season despite missing seven games. Not only is he a more decisive runner than Harvey, but also Dobbins has a higher percentage of explosive rushes (11 percent to 3 percent) and a lower percentage of rushes for no gain or a loss (14 to 21).

It got us thinking. We picked the Los Angeles Rams to win the Super Bowl before the playoffs began — we’re sticking with that — but in the AFC, we think people are overreacting to the Bo Nix injury news. The Broncos would surely be favored by a couple of points at home if he were playing, and now they’re five-point underdogs?!? I’m not sure Nix’s mom thinks he is worth seven points against the spread.

We’re definitely taking the points … and maybe even the upset at +210. The New England Patriots had a historically easy schedule, then got a Los Angeles Chargers team with a turnstile offensive line in the first round and faced C.J. (stands for Careless Juggler) Stroud last week. They’ll finally get tested here, against a No. 1 seed that gets to play the no-respect card as the largest home underdog in a conference championship since 1968, per Pro Football Reference.

And there’s some value with Stidham …

Last week’s record: 2-2 against the spread, 0-1 on best bets

New England Patriots (-5) at Denver Broncos | 3 p.m. ET Sunday, CBS

A great matchup between two pretty good coaches. There’s the Patriots’ Mike Vrabel, tied for the longest-tenured coach in the AFC East, who is finally carrying his weight after Drake Maye carried Vrabel’s defense the first 16 weeks. There’s the Broncos’ Sean Payton, who was almost smirking after he announced that Nix was out for the season — he feels backup QB Stidham is going to let it rip and surprise some people Sunday.

Not me. I was in the house for Stidham’s two starts with the Las Vegas Raiders in 2022. He can sling it. Think of him as a dirt-poor man’s Brett Favre. Stidham has some swagger and loves to throw the ball into tight windows — he has eight touchdowns and eight interceptions in four career starts. And while he is no Nix, he can run it better than people give him credit for. Stidham won’t be the reason the Broncos lose, as long as Dobbins and even Harvey keep the Patriots’ defense honest.

The Patriots hit the road for the first time in the playoffs, and there will be some pressure on Maye. The second-year QB has already fumbled six times in the playoffs, losing three, and he actually leads the league with 14 on the season. Eleven of those were on strip sacks, tying Matt Ryan (2022) for the most since 2020.

As we mentioned last week (when we picked the Bills and — sigh — they missed covering by only two points despite five turnovers), the once-feared Broncos defense has had some serious slippage the past seven weeks. But … Denver can still get after the quarterback. It has 71 sacks — 14 more than anybody else — in 18 games, and even ranks fourth in pressure rate when not blitzing. Patriots left tackle Will Campbell, meanwhile, has not been the same since coming back from a knee injury, allowing four sacks and 10 pressures in the past two games.

That’s enough for me. There’s also this: Home underdogs of 4 or more points in the playoffs are 9-0 ATS in the past 50 years.

The pick: Broncos

Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5) | 6 p.m. ET Sunday, Fox

The Seahawks hammered the 49ers last week, and their defense is the first to rank in the top two in both yards per rush and yards per pass allowed since the 2015 Super Bowl champ Broncos. Too bad they have to face the Rams.

The teams split their two regular-season meetings, but the Rams won the first game and led 30-14 in the fourth quarter of the second. They forced Sam Darnold to throw six interceptions. It’s a little sad how everyone is waiting for Darnold to crumble, but he does have eight interceptions when pressured this season, tied for most in the NFL.

Darnold has been leaning on his defense, but this is not a good matchup for the Seahawks. Puka Nacua had 19 catches for 300 yards in the two games — the most yards by any player against any single opponent across the league all season — and the mighty Seahawks defense also didn’t sack Matthew Stafford once.

Davante Adams is back for this one, after the Rams scored four touchdowns out of three-tight-end formations in his absence in the last matchup. Only one of those was actually caught by a tight end, but the Seahawks rank 27th in EPA per target to tight ends (-0.4), worst among any team to win a playoff game.

Plus, if you go back to when Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald was the Baltimore Ravens’ defensive coordinator, the Rams under coach Sean McVay are averaging 28 points per game in five meetings against Macdonald’s defenses. Macdonald has otherwise allowed 18 points per game with the Seahawks and 17 with the Ravens.

This also now feels like a battle-tested Rams team after two close wins in the playoffs, and it won’t be fazed at all by playing in Seattle. The Rams have won there in each of the past three seasons.

The pick: Rams

Best bet: We’ll go with the Rams again after they failed to cover by half a point for us last week.

NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport dives into the latest with ""Good Morning Football"" about new details emerging around the league in regard to any new or potential hirings.

They’re going to bring back all the stats about the Rams’ pressure and how Sam Darnold struggled against it.
And so, as high as we are for the Seattle Seahawks right now, they’re on the moon.
If they can do that let that defense just eat, Seattle Seahawks back in the Super Bowl.”","Sam Darnold is another week removed from his oblique injury that didn’t keep him out of the divisional round playoff game for the Seattle Seahawks. However, the veteran QB wasn’t asked to do much in the win over the San Francisco 49ers.

Darnold completed 12 of 17 passes for 124 passing yards and one touchdown. Seattle had an impressive ground game and special teams to help with the scoring, along with a dominant defense that didn’t allow the 49ers’ offense to accomplish anything.

Now, in the NFC title game, that could be a different story. While the Seahawks might be looking to replicate the same formula against the Los Angeles Rams, Darnold might need to make a couple of more plays to help Seattle punch their ticket to the Super Bowl.

As a result, head coach Mike Macdonald provided the latest injury update on his QB.

“He feels better than he did going into the [49ers] game, and he showed that he could throw [the ball] then,” Macdonald told reporters on Jan. 22. “We’d like him to get some throws before Sunday.”

Kenneth Walker III was all the offense that the Seahawks needed against San Francisco. Walker ran for 116 rushing yards and three touchdowns on the ground. With the injury to Zach Charbonnet, Walker will be counted on even more, along with taking the offensive responsibilities off Darnold’s shoulders.

Rams Have Been a Thorn in the Side of Seahawks’ Sam Darnold

The Rams gave Darnold the most trouble this 2025 season. Darnold had a passer rating of 62.4, 549 passing yards, two touchdowns, and six interceptions in two games against the Rams this season, per StatMuse.

As a result, former Seahawks star Richard Sherman believes that Darnold will need to overcome this hurdle that plagued him this season to get Seattle to Santa Clara for Super Bowl LX.

“If you’re Sam Darnold, you thought you overcame your nightmares with the Rams,“ Sherman said on the Jan. 19 edition of “The Richard Sherman Podcast.” “You thought you had overcome them. You thought, ‘Hey, I only had to see it once. I killed Freddy Krueger. I killed him. He’s dead.’

“… But he’s going to have to overcome. They’re going to bring back all the stats about the Rams’ pressure and how Sam Darnold struggled against it. And so, as high as we are for the Seattle Seahawks right now, they’re on the moon. They are freaking playing lights-out football defensively.”

Sam Darnold Could Have the Confidence to Face Rams

Darnold’s two touchdowns came in the Seahawks’ comeback overtime win on Dec. 18, which put Seattle in the driver’s seat to win the NFC West and secure the No. 1 seed in the conference. Because of that performance late in the regular season, Darnold could have the belief that he can perform well for four quarters against Los Angeles.

“Now, if I’m Sam Darnold, I watched the last drive in the fourth quarter of that game against the Rams, and I feel pretty good, “ Sherman added. “You were cooking with grease. You were James Harden in the clutch, cooking. So, let’s get back to cooking. Run the football. [Kenneth Walker III] is running as good as he has in his entire career.

“Had three touchdowns in the last game, tying Shaun Alexander for the franchise record [in a postseason game]. If they can do that let that defense just eat, Seattle Seahawks back in the Super Bowl.”",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/sam-darnold-seattle-seahawks_768d71.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-23 13:40:57.033498

San Francisco 49ers president of football operations and general manager John Lynch offered clarity about wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk's future with the franchise.

""I think it's safe to say that he's played his last snap with the Niners,"" Lynch said at the team's end-of-season news conference Wednesday.

Lynch went on to acknowledge that the situation with Aiyuk had gone off course.

""It's unfortunate. A situation that just went awry. And I will look long and hard at what could have been done differently, but sometimes it just doesn't work out. And I think that this was a case where that happened.""

While including Aiyuk in a future trade package is not off the table, Lynch suggested the 49ers would be more inclined to release the 27-year-old wideout. Whichever move comes next would end one of the NFL’s most turbulent player-team standoffs.

Aiyuk’s contract dispute lasted through the 2024 training camp. The two sides eventually reached an agreement on a four-year extension in August 2024, shortly before the regular season kicked off.

GEORGE KITTLE’S WIFE SAYS 49ERS STAR WILL RETURN STRONGER AFTER DEVASTATING NFL PLAYOFF INJURY

Just a few weeks later, Aiyuk and 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan engaged in what appeared to be an animated exchange over the color of the receiver’s practice shorts. Players were reportedly instructed to wear black shorts for a Sept. 27 practice, and Aiyuk arrived in red shorts.

Before tearing his ACL, MCL and meniscus in his right knee in October 2024, Aiyuk was not nearly as productive as he had been in past seasons. He finished with 374 receiving yards over seven games. Aiyuk also missed multiple rehab sessions last offseason.

In July 2025, the 49ers decided to void an estimated $27 million in guarantees included in Aiyuk’s contract for 2026. In December, Shanahan said a considerable amount of time had passed without contact from Aiyuk.

""It’s been pretty simple for me. I haven’t seen him in a month,"" the coach told reporters Dec. 15.

On Wednesday, Shanahan offered more details about the unsuccessful attempts to get in touch with Aiyuk.

""I'd say it officially stopped for me when the last time I tried to get ahold of him and couldn't and then tried a couple more times and still couldn't,"" he said. ""And then that matched everyone else that was trying to get ahold of him to come in. And, eventually, there's not much of an explanation because it's really hard for us and anyone else to understand. And that's why it's something I've never seen in 22 years of coaching. It's unfortunate, and it's confusing because it's confusing for all of us. But it eventually becomes 'it is what it is.'""

Aiyuk was moved to the reserve/left team list last month. He did not appear in any 2025 regular-season or playoff games.

Full analysis, timeline of Branch Achilles injury: Visit Jimmy Liao's full Branch injury analysis.

Recovery is expected to take around 10–11 months, likely delaying his return until mid-2026 season, and he’ll likely start training camp on the PUP list. While most players can return after this injury, his long-term performance level isn’t guaranteed—even though some NFL players have had successful comebacks. Branch is 24 years old and under contract through the 2026 season.

Here is an excerpt of my analysis of Branch's injury:

Branch had many minor injuries to his right leg prior to the Achilles rupture. His Achilles may have already been compromised leading up to the moment of rupture. It’s also possible that the injuries in the preceding weeks to surrounding areas caused extra strain on the calf muscle and Achilles tendon.

The Achilles rupture may have been a culmination of all those antecedent factors coupled with the awkward landing mechanism with external rotation strain of the ankle...

A recovery around 10-11 months is the hope, although a long-term injury like this can have a good amount of variation. If he can return in 10 months, then he would be back on the field in October. Starting training camp on PUP (physically unable to perform) list seems likely. - Jimmy Liao MD

Branch was drafted in the second round (45th overall) out of Alabama in 2023. As of January 2026, he has played in 43 regular-season games with career totals of 258 tackles, 38 passes defended, seven interceptions (one returned for a touchdown) and 4.5 sacks.

The 24-year-old earned a Pro Bowl selection in 2024 and was having another good year before his Achilles injury.

However, head coach Mike Macdonald said prior to Thursday’s practice that the team is “optimistic” Cross will be able to start Sunday’s NFC title game against the Los Angeles Rams, while adding that Jones and Kight were “day to day.”

Meanwhile, Pro Bowl quarterback Sam Darnold (oblique) was limited for a second straight day, as expected. Darnold and Macdonald both acknowledged earlier this week that they’ll have to manage his workload as he deals with an oblique injury that he suffered in practice last week.

More on Seahawks’ left tackle situation

Cross’ foot injury came in the third quarter of Seattle’s 41-6 divisional round playoff rout of the San Francisco 49ers last Saturday night.

Cross also missed the final three games of the regular season with a hamstring injury and dealt with a knee injury that he suffered in practice last week. But this week, he’s only listed with the foot injury.

“Charles is good,” Macdonald said prior to Thursday’s practice. “We’ll see how today goes, but we’re optimistic for the game.”

Jones, a veteran swing tackle, started at left tackle in place of Cross for the final three games of the regular season – including in Week 18, when he played through a knee injury. He’s been sidelined from practice since that Week 18 game.

With Jones ruled out for last Saturday’s divisional round game, Kight filled in at left tackle after Cross got hurt. Kight, an undrafted rookie, injured his knee during the game, Macdonald said.

Macdonald declined to elaborate on the Seahawks’ contingency plans in the event none of their top three options at left tackles are available for Sunday.

“We have a plan for it,” Macdonald said. “I don’t really want to say what we’d do, but we have a plan for it.”

T.J. Watt’s season did not end the way anyone in Pittsburgh expected. Just days before the Pro Bowl Game, the Steelers’ defensive leader found himself ruled out with an injury that forced the league into a late change. Watt had earned his ninth Pro Bowl selection after another strong campaign. Still, instead of heading to Orlando, he is now watching from the sidelines as Jacksonville linebacker Devin Lloyd steps into the spotlight.

NFL replaces T.J. Watt with Jaguars LB Devin Lloyd

On Jan 22, 2026, local Jacksonville radio station 1010 XL confirmed on X that Devin Lloyd had been named as Watt’s replacement for the 2026 Pro Bowl Games. “BREAKING: The Jaguars have been awarded another Pro Bowler! Jaguars LB Devin Lloyd has been named to the 2026 Pro Bowl Games in replacement of injured Steelers LB T.J. Watt,” the station posted. The NFL later confirmed the move, citing Watt’s injury as the reason for his withdrawal. While the Steelers have not released detailed medical specifics, team sources said Watt is not medically cleared to participate in any football activity. Watt’s absence closes the book on what had been another productive year for the 30-year-old. During the 2025 regular season, he recorded 7 sacks, 23 solo tackles, 3 forced fumbles, and 2 interceptions, numbers that once again placed him among the league’s most impactful edge rushers. For Lloyd, the call came as a reward for his best season since entering the league. The former first-round pick started 15 games for Jacksonville in 2025 and finished with 81 total tackles, six tackles for loss, one fumble recovery, and multiple game-changing plays in coverage. His biggest moment came in Week 5 against the Kansas City Chiefs, when he returned a Patrick Mahomes interception 99 yards for a touchdown in the Jaguars’ 31-28 win. Lloyd was also named second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press, becoming just the second linebacker in the last two decades to record at least 10 quarterback hits and five interceptions in a single season. Jaguars general manager James Gladstone spoke about Lloyd’s growth during a media interaction at the team’s end-of-season press conference on Jan. 8. “What he meant to our end result was certainly notable,” Gladstone said. “The way he worked every week, the way he connected with the staff, it showed up on Sundays.” Lloyd now joins long snapper Ross Matiscik as the second Jaguars player selected for the Pro Bowl Games this year. For Pittsburgh, Watt’s injury adds to a difficult offseason. Earlier in 2025, Watt signed a three-year, $123 million extension, and during an appearance on the ""Steelers Now"" podcast in July 2025, he admitted his future was closely tied to head coach Mike Tomlin. “I don’t want to play for anyone other than Mike T,” Watt said on the show. With Watt sidelined and uncertainty around the Steelers’ direction, the moment belongs to Lloyd. His Pro Bowl selection does more than fill a vacancy. It confirms his arrival as one of the AFC’s most complete linebackers.

With Steelers star T.J. Watt forced out due to injury, the NFL had to act fast. That sudden decision has now brought good news for Jacksonville, as one Jaguars defender earns a well-deserved shot on football’s big stage. Local radio station 1010 XL / 92.5 FM shared the news on X.

“BREAKING: The Jaguars have been awarded another Pro Bowler!” the tweet read. “Jaguars LB Devin Lloyd has been named to the 2026 Pro Bowl Games in replacement of injured Steelers LB T.J. Watt.”

The announcement quickly gained traction among Jaguars fans.

Lloyd replaces Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt, who was ruled out after reportedly suffering a serious injury during a dry needling session, where a needle caused his lung to collapse. He was hospitalized and later underwent successful surgery, but he is still not healthy enough to return for the Pro Bowl.

Lloyd became just the second player in the last 20 seasons to post at least 10 quarterback hits and five interceptions, joining Lavonte David’s 2013 season. He was also named a second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press. His 99-yard third-quarter interception return for a touchdown off Patrick Mahomes played a big part in the Jaguars’ 31-28 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 5.

Statistically, Lloyd posted his best numbers in his four-year career since being drafted in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Starting 15 games, he totalled 81 combined tackles, six tackles for loss, and one fumble recovery. Such figures even earned him the praise of the Jaguars hierarchy.

“Such an impactful season. What he meant to our end result was certainly notable,” Jaguars general manager James Gladstone said. “The way in which he operated on a daily, weekly basis was really cool to watch and observe. He committed himself to being the best version. The connection between him, the coaching staff was real. He was being deployed in the right ways.”

Devin Lloyd has now become the second Jaguars player, after long snapper Ross Matiscik, who was named a starter last month, to make the Pro Bowl Games. Lloyd’s Pro Bowl selection caps a statement season and reinforces the Jaguars’ growing presence among the league’s elite defenders.

As for T.J. Watt, his absence will be a tough blow for Pittsburgh. The linebacker’s future with the Steelers also seems uncertain, after his contract extension included a unique clause.

T.J. Watt’s loyalty to the Steelers is tied to Mike Tomlin

T.J. Watt, the Steelers’ all-time sack leader (115), has made it clear that his loyalty to Pittsburgh was closely tied to head coach Mike Tomlin. When negotiating his 2025 contract extension, Watt reportedly included a clause specifying that he would only play under Tomlin, underscoring the coach’s impact on his decision.

On Monday, Steelers Depot shared a tweet highlighting Watt’s stance on the contract: “It was huge in my contract talks. I don’t want to play for anyone other than Mike T.”

T.J. Watt’s deal with the Steelers wasn’t just about money; it was about trust. The star pass rusher made it clear during 2025 contract talks that he would suit up only if Mike Tomlin remained in charge, showing the coach’s irreplaceable role.

In July 2025, Watt signed a three-year, $123 million extension, making him one of the NFL’s highest-paid defenders. His 2025 regular-season performance underscored his dominance on the field, tallying 23 solo tackles, 7 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, and 2 interceptions.

T.J. Watt’s injury and Mike Tomlin’s departure mark a challenging period for the Steelers, putting both the team’s future and Watt’s commitment in question. While Watt’s dominance on the field is undeniable, his absence opens the door for rising stars like Devin Lloyd, highlighting the ever-changing landscape of the NFL and the impact of leadership on player loyalty.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/essentiallysports_articles_591/f2aef215ddfac82d82eb6d795a3251c2,N,,2026-01-22 22:39:05.200527

Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said earlier Thursday that he is optimistic that starting left tackle Charles Cross will play against the Rams. Cross, though, remained out of practice with his foot injury.

Cross missed the final three games of the regular season with a hamstring injury and injured a knee last week in practice before leaving with a foot injury in Saturday’s playoff win over the 49ers.

Taking trash out Anybody expecting the Rams to talk trash about the Seahawks will be waiting for a long time.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Rob Havenstein and Tyler Higbee are the only two players who have been on Sean McVay's roster throughout the coach's nine seasons with the Los Angeles Rams.

While Higbee remains an important part of the Rams' offense heading into the third NFC championship game of this McVay era on Sunday, Havenstein took the first step Thursday toward potentially finishing his injury-plagued season on the field as well.

Havenstein rejoined his teammates in practice for the first time since he went down in mid-November, creating the possibility for the longtime starter to return from injured reserve this season. After spending most of the past two months watching from the sideline during practice, Havenstein was back on the field at their training complex in Woodland Hills.

“It was a long road,” Havenstein said. “I had some challenging times, but that’s what this game is. ... I’m focused on what I can do each day back. Haven’t played football in a while in a real capacity, so I’m doing what I can do each day to kind of build, and we’ll see where the chips fall.”

Havenstein is the longest-tenured member of the Rams' current roster and he has been a stalwart starter at right tackle when healthy since his rookie season in St. Louis in 2015. He has started 148 games over 11 seasons for the Rams along with 13 playoff starts, including two Super Bowls.

But injuries have limited Havenstein to 18 games over the past two seasons. He has played in just seven games this season, last appearing in the Rams' 21-19 victory over Seattle at SoFi Stadium in Week 11 before being sidelined by an ankle injury and knee bursitis.

Warren McClendon Jr. has generally played well since replacing Havenstein in the starting lineup this season, although he had a few glaring mistakes in the Rams’ 20-17 overtime victory at Chicago last Sunday in the divisional round. But Havenstein makes it clear he never gave up on playing again this season.

“Whatever it is, you want to do it for your family,” Havenstein said. “I’ve got my 7-year-old (who's) going to ask me why I’m not out there right now, so it’s understanding that, and trying to be the man and the father that I want to be. You’ve got to be about it instead of just talking about it. Staying engaged, staying ready to go, doing what I can, conditioning, extra lifts, extra rehabs, just trying to get back to feeling as good as I can.”

The Rams (14-5) visit the Seahawks (16-3) on Sunday for the NFC title game, hoping to earn a third conference championship for Havenstein and Higbee. McVay led the Rams to the Super Bowl in the 2018 season and the 2021 season — but Higbee only played in one of those games after getting hurt in the NFC title game against San Francisco four years ago.

“Rob and Tyler, these are rare humans,” McVay said Thursday. ""They're great football players, but they're great leaders, and they have such respect from the locker room. ... You look at the wisdom that Rob has in the meeting room to pour into Warren and really our offensive line as a whole. These are two all-time guys. These are legacy Rams. Obviously they're special to me.""

Higbee and Havenstein frequently hold court in their corner of the Rams' locker room, teasing and roasting their younger teammates. Havenstein also takes his role seriously as a leader and mentor, even when he's not healthy enough to play.

“When I was a young guy, I had a lot of guys impart a lot of wisdom on me, so it would be selfish me not to kind of give back what I was taught,” Havenstein said. “If I can help out in a 1% way, then I’ve been doing my job, and that’s what the ‘C’ on my chest still means.”

Injuries

LB Byron Young missed his second straight day of practice to rest the knee injury that has bothered him periodically throughout the season, but McVay expects the Rams' sacks leader to play Sunday.

Taking trash out

Anybody expecting the Rams to talk trash about the Seahawks will be waiting for a long time.

When talkative linebacker Jared Verse took the podium and fielded a question about the Rams' hunger for a payback victory in this rematch, he glanced pointedly at a Rams' public relations staffer and said: “I was told not to give bulletin board material.”

While Higbee remains an important part of the Rams' offense heading into the third NFC championship game of this McVay era on Sunday, Havenstein took the first step Thursday toward potentially finishing his injury-plagued season on the field as well.

Havenstein rejoined his teammates in practice for the first time since he went down in mid-November, creating the possibility for the longtime starter to return from injured reserve this season. After spending most of the past two months watching from the sideline during practice, Havenstein was back on the field at their training complex in Woodland Hills.

“It was a long road,” Havenstein said. “I had some challenging times, but that’s what this game is. ... I’m focused on what I can do each day back. Haven’t played football in a while in a real capacity, so I’m doing what I can do each day to kind of build, and we’ll see where the chips fall.”

Havenstein is the longest-tenured member of the Rams' current roster and he has been a stalwart starter at right tackle when healthy since his rookie season in St. Louis in 2015. He has started 148 games over 11 seasons for the Rams along with 13 playoff starts, including two Super Bowls.

But injuries have limited Havenstein to 18 games over the past two seasons. He has played in just seven games this season, last appearing in the Rams' 21-19 victory over Seattle at SoFi Stadium in Week 11 before being sidelined by an ankle injury and knee bursitis.

Warren McClendon Jr. has generally played well since replacing Havenstein in the starting lineup this season, although he had a few glaring mistakes in the Rams’ 20-17 overtime victory at Chicago last Sunday in the divisional round. But Havenstein makes it clear he never gave up on playing again this season.

“Whatever it is, you want to do it for your family,” Havenstein said. “I’ve got my 7-year-old (who's) going to ask me why I’m not out there right now, so it’s understanding that, and trying to be the man and the father that I want to be. You’ve got to be about it instead of just talking about it. Staying engaged, staying ready to go, doing what I can, conditioning, extra lifts, extra rehabs, just trying to get back to feeling as good as I can.”

The Rams (14-5) visit the Seahawks (16-3) on Sunday for the NFC title game, hoping to earn a third conference championship for Havenstein and Higbee. McVay led the Rams to the Super Bowl in the 2018 season and the 2021 season — but Higbee only played in one of those games after getting hurt in the NFC title game against San Francisco four years ago.

“Rob and Tyler, these are rare humans,” McVay said Thursday. ""They're great football players, but they're great leaders, and they have such respect from the locker room. ... You look at the wisdom that Rob has in the meeting room to pour into Warren and really our offensive line as a whole. These are two all-time guys. These are legacy Rams. Obviously they're special to me.""

Higbee and Havenstein frequently hold court in their corner of the Rams' locker room, teasing and roasting their younger teammates. Havenstein also takes his role seriously as a leader and mentor, even when he's not healthy enough to play.

“When I was a young guy, I had a lot of guys impart a lot of wisdom on me, so it would be selfish me not to kind of give back what I was taught,” Havenstein said. “If I can help out in a 1% way, then I’ve been doing my job, and that’s what the ‘C’ on my chest still means.”

Injuries

LB Byron Young missed his second straight day of practice to rest the knee injury that has bothered him periodically throughout the season, but McVay expects the Rams' sacks leader to play Sunday.

Taking trash out

Anybody expecting the Rams to talk trash about the Seahawks will be waiting for a long time.

When talkative linebacker Jared Verse took the podium and fielded a question about the Rams' hunger for a payback victory in this rematch, he glanced pointedly at a Rams' public relations staffer and said: “I was told not to give bulletin board material.”

Seahawks GM Schneider named PFWA’s Executive of the Year

Cross was listed as a non-participant on Wednesday’s practice report after suffering a foot injury in the third quarter of Seattle’s 41-6 divisional round playoff rout of the San Francisco 49ers last Saturday night.

Cross’ foot injury came after he missed the final three games of the regular season with a hamstring injury and also dealt with a knee injury that he suffered in practice last week. But on Wednesday’s practice report, he was only listed with the foot injury.

“Charles is good,” Macdonald said. “We’ll see how today goes, but we’re optimistic for the game.”

Macdonald also said backup left tackle Josh Jones (knee, ankle) and third-string left tackle Amari Kight (knee) are “day to day” after being listed as non-participants in Wednesday’s practice.

Jones, a veteran swing tackle, started at left tackle in place of Cross for the final three games of the regular season – including in Week 18, when he played through a knee injury. He’s been sidelined from practice since that Week 18 game.

With Jones ruled out for last Saturday’s divisional round game, Kight filled in at left tackle after Cross got hurt. Kight, an undrafted rookie, injured his knee during the game, Macdonald said.

Christian McCaffrey returned from leg injuries with a vengeance this season.

A calf injury in August 2024 that was supposed to keep the running back out ""a couple weeks"" turned into him missing the first eight games of the season. He then sustained a knee injury after just four games and sat out the remainder of the year.

But this season, he was his usual self, and it has resulted in quite the recognition from the media.

With his performance after last year's disappointment, McCaffrey is obviously in the running — and probably the favorite — to be the league’s Comeback Player of the Year. But that’s not all.

McCaffrey is the only non-quarterback to be an MVP finalist, and he is also in the running for his second Offensive Player of the Year Award in three years after putting up 2,126 scrimmage yards and scoring 17 total touchdowns.

Only Adrian Peterson in 2012 and Joe Burrow last year have been finalists for all three awards in one season (Drew Brees finished second for all in 2006, but finalists were not named then). Peterson was named the MVP and OPOY while finishing second in Comeback Player of the Year, while Burrow was the Comeback Player of the Year for the second time in his career, which he joked isn't exactly ideal.

McCaffrey finished 76 yards shy of his second 1,000-1,000 season, but he joined the fraternity in 2019 along with Roger Craig and Marshall Faulk. He did, however, have by far the most receptions of any running back with 102 — Bijan Robinson was second with 79.

Earlier this season, McCaffrey was named a first-team All-Pro for the third time in his career. McCaffrey is one of eight players with three or more 2,000-yard scrimmage seasons. Faulk, Eric Dickerson and Walter Payton each had four.

As an aside, McCaffrey is also a finalist for the NFL's Salute to Service Award, presented by USAA, which ""[uses] the power of football to connect with, empower, appreciate and uplift our service members, veterans and their families.""

The quarterback may need a procedure on his right foot, general manager and president of football operations Brandon Beane said Wednesday.

“He could have to have something done to his foot, potentially here soon,"" Beane said. ""But it would not impact OTA stuff if he does.""

Foot issue lingered for weeks

Allen’s right foot injury dates back to Buffalo’s Week 16 win over the Cleveland Browns. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that Allen aggravated an ""old bone issue on the side of his foot.""

Allen was injured on a 22-yard sack late in the second quarter while retreating in the pocket, falling awkwardly to the turf. He walked to the sideline and was evaluated by athletic trainers before walking to the locker room just prior to halftime with his right cleat off. X-rays taken at halftime were negative, and Allen returned for the second half.

The soreness persisted. Allen underwent additional X-rays on his right foot following a Week 17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. In Week 18, he played just one snap to extend his consecutive starts streak as the Bills rested multiple starters.

Allen played through multiple injuries in playoffs

Allen appeared on the injury report ahead of the AFC divisional round against the Denver Broncos with foot, knee and finger ailments, but was a full participant in practice during the final two sessions of the week.

In the wild-card round the week prior, Allen made two trips to the blue medical tent — once for a concussion evaluation and once to have his knee checked — without missing any snaps.

Busy offseason ahead

If Allen elects to have a procedure, Beane did not provide a timeline. Organized team activities are typically in late May and early June.","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/22/PROC/88297393007-getty-images-2255756495.jpg?crop=5643,3176,x3,y86&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-22 19:39:11.161806

Outside linebacker Harold Landry III and inside linebacker Marte Mapu also remained sidelined as the AFC Championship Game closes in.

Bradbury, who saw every down in the wild card as well as the divisional round, held ironman status until the final two games of the regular season. As for the absences across the ball in Foxborough, both linebackers have missed back-to-back practices leading up to the visit to Mile High. A lingering knee issue has kept Landry on the injury report since late in the fall. New England’s sack leader went from questionable to active last weekend before playing just 11 out of 75 defensive snaps off the edges. A hip issue, meanwhile, has kept Mapu off the field during Broncos prep after logging 58 percent of the workload on special teams in the sendoff at Gillette Stadium.

The Patriots opened Hollins’ activation window on Thursday. The veteran wide receiver, who landed on injured reserve in December because of an abdomen injury, missed four starts before joining the limited in a red non-contact jersey. His return made it six partial participants for the AFC East champions. Count Davis among the others. The starting cornerback has been available for consecutive practices after entering the NFL’s concussion protocol in the final minutes of the divisional round. Two interceptions, two pass breakups and four tackles, including one for loss, were tallied before No. 7 headed to the locker room.

New England’s full participants on Wednesday went unchanged on Thursday. Two of whom recently had their 21-day practice windows open. On injured reserve since sustaining a concussion on the first night of December, Jennings awaits a potential return to the active running back room. And at defensive tackle, the rookie Farmer missed four games with a hamstring injury. Like Hollins, both are eligible to return to a 53-man roster that currently stands at capacity.

More Seahawks on SI stories Seahawks get bad injury news ahead of NFC Championship Sam Darnold one of NFL’s biggest winners from divisional round What separates the Seahawks from Rams, Broncos & Patriots","The Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams both released initial injury reports on Wednesday afternoon, although the Rams did not actually practice and put out an estimation of their report. Despite being the significantly-better rested team in recent weeks, with much less travel and a bye, the Seahawks report was much longer, although that’s not the only consideration.

Once you dig through the actual information in the report, things clear up fast. Demarcus Lawrence, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Leonard Williams were all listed as limited for rest, as none of them have any actual injury designation, so nothing to worry about there.

Elijah Arroyo (knee) and Chazz Surratt (ankle) were both listed as full participants, and seem to be quite healthy. Questions remain over whether those two players will be activated this week, but it pretty clearly has more to do with whether the team has any need for them or room for them on the roster rather than their health.

A notable listing here is George Holani (hamstring), who has been on injured reserve for a couple months but practiced in full today, with indications that he’s been physically ready for some time now and should be ready for this weekend. Tyrice Knight (shoulder) was a full participant as well, marking him as available as a backup linebacker this weekend.

The pool of limited players was also relatively comforting. Sam Darnold (oblique) is among them, which was pretty obviously going to be the case after the way Coach Macdonald spoke about him earlier this week, but it’s fairly clear that it’s just a matter of limiting his practice reps to make sure he’s got everything he needs to have success on Sunday. No issues here.

Uchenna Nwosu (hamstring), Robbie Ouzts (neck), and Bryce Cabeldue (knee) also missed some of practice, but got enough in to indicate they will be fine. Ouzts missed a good chunk of the 49ers game with the injury so it makes sense to ease him back in. Cabeldue is interesting since he wasn’t even active on Saturday.

The problem kicks in when you see the three players that didn’t participate today. Normally, only three players missing practice on Wednesday is a good thing, but in this case, all three players play the same position. Charles Cross (foot), Josh Jones (knee, ankle), and Amari Kight (knee) all sat out today, leaving the Seahawks with very little at left tackle.

The good news is that Cross participated in the walkthrough this morning, and Macdonald already said that Cross might play on Sunday without actually practicing during the week. I’m less optimistic about Jones, who seems to be breaking down physically after gutting out the week eighteen game against the 49ers. Kight played well last week but remains inexperienced.

If all three players are unavailable for the Seahawks this weekend, it becomes a scramble drill to field a left tackle. Grey Zabel could be bumped outside, Mason Richman and Bryce Cabeldue could get the call for their first NFL starts, and Logan Brown might get attention as a practice squader the team seems to like. None of this feels particularly good.

There’s no point in panicking on a Wednesday, however, and we’ll need to see how things progress over the next couple days before we assume the worst. Wednesday practices are often the day to play things extra-cautious and understand that players don’t need every single rep to play well on game day.

The Rams have a lot less to be concerned about, although again, they didn’t actually practice. ED Josaiah Stewart (knee) was listed as a full participant, and CB Emmanuel Forbes (shoulder) got hit with a limited designation. Forbes got injured and was forced to leave the game in Chicago last week, and with the Rams thin at corner his situation is worth monitoring.

Only two players were listed with the DNP tag, and one of them is S Quentin Lake (illness), and the odds of an illness of any kind keeping a player out of a conference championship game is almost zero. Particularly in that the illness seems to have been caught so early in the week. ED Byron Young (knee), however, was the other injury, and his potential loss looms very large.

We’ll see what the teams pass along tomorrow before we make any broad assumptions, but the early indications are that this will be a game without an excessive number of injuries, although for the Seahawks, where those injuries are might be very impactful.

On Thursday, the Rams held a normal practice but were once again without one of their top players. Byron Young is still sidelined by a knee injury suffered against the Chicago Bears on Sunday, missing his second straight day.

Sean McVay said the team is being smart with Young leading up to this weekend’s game, and that he’s still expected to play. As for some good news, Quentin Lake was back in the building Thursday after staying away from the team Wednesday due to an illness. McVay hoped it would be a quick bug, which appears to be the case considering Lake returned Thursday.

Emmanuel Forbes Jr. was limited to start the week on Wednesday due to a shoulder injury but he's expected to play against the Seahawks this weekend, McVay says. The Rams are healthy at just about every position, which is great news, but Young's status is one to monitor.

,,2026-01-22 23:49:33+00:00,The Athletic,Brandon Aiyuk is gone. What's next for the 49ers at wide receiver? How about some speed?,Matt Barrows,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6990139/2026/01/22/brandon-aiyuk-49ers-wide-receiver-needs/,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. — The San Francisco 49ers need speed at wide receiver.
“We were noticeably slower this year than we have been in years past,” Shanahan said at the team’s end-of-season news conference.
Sorry.” Shanahan said Aiyuk stopped fielding phone calls, including a number of attempts from Shanahan.
No 49ers wideout or running back cracked 20 mph, with Robinson coming the closest at 19.66 mph in Week 13.
Jennings’ 643 receiving yards led the 49ers’ wideouts, but it was the most modest team high for a Shanahan-coached wide receiver since Kendrick Bourne had 487 yards in 2018.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. — The San Francisco 49ers need speed at wide receiver.

Coach Kyle Shanahan acknowledged Wednesday that it was missing from his passing attack in 2025, a season in which the team’s top deep threat, Brandon Aiyuk, went AWOL and the next-best option, Ricky Pearsall, dealt with a knee injury from Week 4 onward.

“We were noticeably slower this year than we have been in years past,” Shanahan said at the team’s end-of-season news conference. “Sometimes that’s substituted for a better football player. That doesn’t mean you’re always worse because of that. But you definitely need more speed out there to handle things week in and week out for some of the situations that come up versus certain schemes and certain defenses.”

Neither Shanahan nor general manager John Lynch minced words about Aiyuk, whom the 49ers placed on the reserve/left squad list last month after he stopped going into the team facility to rehabilitate his 2024 ACL injury. Lynch said a roster move was forthcoming, adding, “I think it’s safe to say that he has played his last snap with the Niners.”

Asked if he could shed more light on how the relationship with the receiver, who had just signed a four-year, $120 million extension a year earlier, became so estranged, Lynch said, “I wish I knew. I can’t help you there. Sorry.”

Shanahan said Aiyuk stopped fielding phone calls, including a number of attempts from Shanahan.

“It’s something I’ve never seen in 22 years of coaching,” he said. “So it’s unfortunate, and it’s confusing.”

His departure will leave the 49ers with six receivers signed for the upcoming season: Pearsall, Demarcus Robinson, Jacob Cowing, Jordan Watkins, Malik Turner and Junior Bergen. It also gives the Niners some extra cash after they voided Aiyuk’s future guarantees.

The 49ers might use some of those savings on Jauan Jennings, who led the team with nine receiving touchdowns in 2025 and is scheduled for free agency. The two sides failed to hash out a long-term deal in the summer, with Jennings instead agreeing to a reworked one-year deal. Still, Lynch said the team would try to rekindle those discussions this offseason.

“He dealt with a lot of injuries throughout the course of the year, but Jauan always plays with a passion,” Lynch said. “We can always count on Jauan. We can move him around. He blocks, he does the little things. You can see by the way the other players respond that he plays the right way, and I think it frustrates other people. He makes us better. We’d love to have him back. We’ll go to work to try to get that accomplished, and we’ll see where that goes.”

While Jennings’ return would bolster the 2026 receiving unit, he wouldn’t solve San Francisco’s speed issue. According to Next Gen Stats, the 49ers’ fastest ball carrier in 2025 was a linebacker, Dee Winters, who reached 20.15 mph on his pick six in Indianapolis in Week 16. No 49ers wideout or running back cracked 20 mph, with Robinson coming the closest at 19.66 mph in Week 13.

Jennings’ 643 receiving yards led the 49ers’ wideouts, but it was the most modest team high for a Shanahan-coached wide receiver since Kendrick Bourne had 487 yards in 2018.

The 49ers have speed on the roster. Cowing and Watkins both ran sub-4.4-second 40-yard dashes before their respective drafts, and Pearsall clocked 4.41 seconds before his. But none could stay on the field in 2025. Cowing suffered a hamstring strain in the opening practice of training camp, then aggravated the injury multiple times while rehabilitating. He said he finally got on top of it by the end of the season and is entering the offseason healthy.

Watkins, a rookie, was off to a good start before suffering a high-ankle sprain in the preseason opener.

“If there were a couple more injuries for these receivers in the last month or so, then Jordan would’ve been up,” Shanahan said. “It wasn’t that he wasn’t capable — it’s that he missed his window to pass some people (on the depth chart).”

Then there’s Pearsall. He was averaging nearly 17 yards per catch before his PCL injury against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 4. He returned in Week 11 but aggravated the knee in Week 17.

Asked if Pearsall can better prepare himself to withstand injuries, Shanahan said he thought the receiver did that last offseason when he added weight and was one of the most physically fit players on the roster.

“I think he was leading the league in a lot of categories before he got hurt,” Shanahan said. “And then he landed on his knee in the wrong way. And when you land on your knee the wrong way, and you hurt your PCL, sometimes that can last a week, like (Los Angeles Rams receiver) Puka (Nacua) last year. Sometimes it can last seven weeks.”

“So, can he prepare to not land on his knee? No.”

Odds and ends

• Shanahan called assistant head coach Gus Bradley the top internal candidate to replace Robert Saleh at defensive coordinator.

“I wouldn’t say it’s a real wide net,” he said of the team’s upcoming search. “But I mean, Gus is the obvious one to everyone, and it is to us, too. Gus would be the main internal candidate.”

Bradley is a mentor of Saleh, the new Tennessee Titans head coach. He’s a three-time NFL defensive coordinator who was head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars from 2013 to 2016.

• Lynch said rookie defensive tackle Alfred Collins might have to have a procedure on his shoulder in the coming weeks. Tight end Jake Tonges, meanwhile, has a plantar fascia issue with his foot but won’t need surgery. Linebacker Nick Martin, who suffered a concussion on Nov. 30, has been making steady progress recently, Lynch said, but is not quite out of the league’s concussion protocol.

• Lynch said defensive ends Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams, who suffered ACL tears in 2025, could be back around the time training camp opens. He wouldn’t put a firm timeline on any of their injured players, including George Kittle (Achilles), but all appear to at least have a chance of being ready before Week 1. Lynch said Bosa was “tracking really well.”

• Tailback Jordan James got his first carries Saturday in Seattle, and Shanahan said the rookie finished the season with a flourish.

“He was ready to go here these last six weeks of the year, big time,” the coach said. “There wasn’t an opportunity for him. But if he has an offseason that we think he’s capable of and can improve, especially the way he looked here at the end of the year, I feel very excited about him helping us.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/21202059/USATSI_24425872-scaled-e1763774655766.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-22 23:39:24.425061

In theNFL playoffsfor the 2025 season, Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix took down the Chicago Bears to advance to the AFC Championship Game. In the process, Nix sustained a season-ending injury in overtime. Enter: Jarrett Stidham.

The Broncos backup is expected to start in the conference championship game. The occasion will mark not only his first start of the season, but only the fifth start of his career.

Stidham will be the second quarterback in history to make his first start of the season in the conference championship game or later, joining Dallas Cowboys' Roger Staubach, who made his first start of the season in the 1972 NFC Championship.

Stidham was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fourth round in 2019 (133rd overall). The Broncos are his third team (Patriots andRaiders). He is 1-3 in four career starts, with eight touchdowns and eight interceptions.

Stidham has played four snaps this season and hasn't thrown a pass since Jan. 7, 2024 (Week 18 of the 2023 season). He'll be just the second QB since 1950 to start a playoff game without a single passing yard on the season, joining Joe Webb, who started a 2012 wild-card game for the Minnesota Vikings.

Four Seahawks, two players and two coaches were named finalists for Associated Press awards for the 2025 NFL season. Head coach Mike Macdonald is up for Coach of the Year, offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak is a finalist for Assistant Coach of the Year, rookie safety Nick Emmanwori is a finalist for Defensive Rookie of the Year and receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba is up for Offensive Player of the Year.

Macdonald helped lead the Seahawks to another winning season, going 14-3 in his second season and claimed the NFC West title as well as the NFC's No. 1 seed. In his second season, Seattle allowed the fewest points in the NFL (17.2 per game) and were the No. 1 team in the league overall, as well as the No. 1 defense according DVOA, Seattle also posted a +191 point differential for the regular season, good for first in the NFL and a franchise record. The Seahawks also set a single-season franchise record with 14 wins and set the single-season franchise record for road wins (8). Macdonald ranks second place in NFL history for the most road wins by a head coach in his first two seasons with 15. Seattle was 7-1 last year and 8-1 this season on the road.

Along with leading the NFL in receiving yards, Smith-Njigba became the first player in NFL history with at least 75 receiving yards in each of his first 11 games of a season. He also had nine 100-yard games this season, the most in the NFL, and the most in a single season in franchise history. Along with that, Smith-Njigba set multiple franchise records and did enough to put his name next to NFL greats in the league record books.

Other candidates for Offensive Player of the Year are Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, Rams receiver Puka Nacua and Falcons running back Bijan Robinson.

Emmanwori, who was injured on the first drive of the season-opener, missed three games, dealing with an ankle injury. But when he returned, it looked like he hadn't missed any time at all. During the regular season, he started 11 of the 14 games he played in and had 81 tackles, nine tackles for loss, 11 passes defensed, 2.5 sacks, four quarterback hits and an interception. Emmanwori was the only player in the league this season with at least 80 tackles, 10 passes defensed and eight tackles for loss.

The other finalists for Defensive Rookie of the Year are Giants outside linebacker Abdul Carter, Flacons defensive end James Pearce Jr., Browns linebacker Carson Schwesinger and Falcons safety Xavier Watts.

The Cardinals defensive lineman smiles when things are good. He often smiles even when things are not good. And to be fair, the good was in short supply this past season, certainly as a team and more than Robinson wanted on a personal level.

At one point, after the loss in Tampa in early December, he said postgame ""I'm not who I thought I was."" And he acknowledged earlier in the season, when ""I wasn't seeing the results I wanted to see,"" fun was hard to come by.

But Robinson was praised by coaches for his intangible efforts, and his run defense, and he doesn't necessarily need to see stats to feel right. He'll smile through the journey.

""I am process-driven,"" Robinson said. ""The results don't matter as much, because we're also not winning. So the process, how much I can go and the alignments we play and how much I can get better and do my job.

""We will have a long offseason to reflect. I want to give myself something positive to think about.""

Robinson had only one sack – ""I have to affect the quarterback way more than I have the last two years"" – and four tackles for loss over 43 tackles in 15 games, and as a first-round pick he knows that isn't enough.

""I can be so much better, and I will be better,"" he said.

After a lost rookie season because of a calf injury, Robinson's second season was about the learning curve. He was helped with a close relationship with veteran Calais Campbell (he called Campbell his best friend on the team) and the wisdom Campbell would frequently impart.

Robinson played better later in the season, when defensive coordinator Nick Rallis noted how Robinson's confidence had clearly grown.

""There is no time to think up front,"" Rallis said. ""As soon as those techniques become second nature to him … the more comfortable he gets and the faster he plays, the more violent he can play. He will utilize his skillset and he'll just keep getting better.""

With a new head coach incoming and a new defense to learn, Robinson's role – and his trajectory – is now in a sort of limbo. But with the way he operates, he will smile through whatever changes come his way.

As the season came to a close, Robinson said he was unlikely to go home to Michigan. He wanted to decompress somewhere warm. And far away.

“Feeling really good,” Darnold said.

What happens next Seattle’s next on-field update should come through the week’s practice participation and any Friday status clarity heading into the NFC Championship.","Seattle Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald delivered a notable Sam Darnold injury update on Jan. 21, saying the quarterback is improving but won’t be a “full go” all week as the team manages his throwing workload ahead of Sunday’s NFC Championship matchup against the Los Angeles Rams.

“Sam continues to get better,” Macdonald told reporters. “He’s not going to be a full go the whole week so we have a plan… we’ll kind of take it day by day… But he won’t be like throwing every ball every play for the whole week.”

Darnold, speaking after studying last week’s film, echoed that he’s feeling better while acknowledging the week will include rehab and body maintenance as Seattle pushes toward the Super Bowl.

“Feeling really good,” Darnold said. “Just attack and rehab these last couple days obviously [and] will be throughout the week… just got to continue to prepare and get my body right for Sunday.”

Key details from the Seahawks’ update

Macdonald: Darnold is improving, but Seattle will limit him during the week and evaluate day to day.

Darnold: Said he felt good throwing in warm-ups last week and is focused on rehab and being ready for Sunday.

Bottom line: This sounds like a managed-practice week, not a declaration that Darnold is out.

What “limited” could mean as the week unfolds

In practical terms, Seattle’s plan can show up in a few ways: fewer total throws during team periods, more mental reps in walkthrough settings, and additional snaps for the backup quarterbacks during practice. That approach matters because the NFL’s injury/practice participation designations are typically the clearest public signal of how a player is trending: Did Not Participate, Limited, or Full.

Macdonald’s “not a full go” wording suggests Darnold may land in the Limited bucket at least once this week — and the biggest tell will be whether his participation increases as Sunday gets closer. If he’s trending the right way, fans usually see the workload build from midweek to the end of the week.

Darnold also made it clear he still values getting reps even late in the season.

“Reps are reps,” he said. “Reps are always vital throughout the week.”

Why it matters for Seattle’s game plan vs. the Rams

Seattle is facing Los Angeles for the third time, and Darnold called the Rams a “really good defense” with a “really good scheme,” crediting their disguises and pressures for causing problems earlier in the season.

From a Seahawks perspective, a limited throwing week can nudge the offense toward what Darnold emphasized as a core point: staying efficient early in downs.

“Staying on schedule… staying positive on first and second down,” he said, adding that the run game has helped open up play-action and other complementary calls.

Darnold also acknowledged the stakes of this stage while insisting Seattle’s routine is the anchor.

“It’s win or go home at this point,” he said, “but… we look at it as another game… we trust our process throughout the week.”

Other injury/availability notes Seattle mentioned

While the Darnold plan is the headline, Macdonald also touched on other roster health items Wednesday, saying tackle Josh Jones was not expected to practice and that Charles Cross was being worked through after a walk-through. Macdonald also said the team is excited to get George Fant back on the field.

Darnold, meanwhile, confirmed Seattle will miss Zach Charbonnet, calling him a “huge part” of the offense, while adding the Seahawks have other players ready to step up.

What happens next

Seattle’s next on-field update should come through the week’s practice participation and any Friday status clarity heading into the NFC Championship. For now, the Seahawks have made their stance clear: Darnold is improving, but Seattle plans to manage him and evaluate the week one day at a time.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256827326-e1769040071996.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-22 18:40:33.979476

The Broncos forced five Buffalo turnovers last week after coaxing only 14 during the regular season, with no more than two in any game previously.
The Patriots know they can't waste possessions and fall in an early hole, or Denver's pass rush could be even more of a problem.
The Broncos' rush defense was one of the best in the NFL during the regular season, allowing 91.1 rush yards per game and 3.9 yards per carry.
Getting him back would be a huge development in both the run and pass games, even if Harvey has been their primary receiving back this season.","Stidham is set to make his first start since Week 18 of the 2023 season -- the Broncos would go on to select Bo Nix in the first round the following April. The ex-Patriots fourth-rounder entered the NFL with current Pats offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who later brought Stidham to the Raiders when he was head coach. McDaniels could shed some light on his former QB given that Stidham hasn't attempted a regular-season pass in two years. Denver's offense is bound to look different than the Nix-led scheme, built on the second-year pro's athleticism, designed QB runs and his ability to get outside of the pocket. Stidham isn't nearly as good an athlete, with scrambling as a last resort and little utility as a runner outside of short yardage. He possesses good arm talent and can deliver crisp, on-target, timely throws when things are on schedule, although Stidham can struggle to navigate pressure. Expect Sean Payton to dial up a game plan heavy on the quick passing game and in-breaking routes, with a few shot plays mixed in, and perhaps leaning more on the run game. An opening-drive score would do a lot to settle Stidham in. But how healthy is the offense? Wide receivers Pat Bryant and Troy Franklin and center Alex Forsyth left their Divisional Round win over the Bills with injuries. The Patriots defense has also shown its mettle, allowing only 448 yards and 19 points combined vs. the Chargers and Texans, with nine sacks and six takeaways in the playoffs. Defensive tackle Milton Williams is back and is a problem, the Patriots' linebackers have shown up and the secondary, led by cornerback Christian Gonzalez, has been mostly excellent. This will be a tough task for Stidham against some of his former teammates.

The pass protection for Drake Maye has not been excellent in two postseason games, allowing 10 sacks and 31 pressures on 66 dropbacks. The MVP-candidate Maye has fumbled six times in the two games, and Denver's rush is as dangerous a pass-rush team in the league, harassing Josh Allen into four turnovers last week, even with some big plays allowed. Broncos edge rusher Nik Bonitto vs. Patriots rookie LT Will Campbell is a potentially exploitable matchup for Denver after Campbell struggled vs. Houston. Maye's regular-season path might have been easier than other quarterback's in the regular season, but he's faced two tough defenses in the playoffs -- and the Patriots' offensive results have been hot and cold. They need more consistent production from wide receiver Stefon Diggs and tight end Hunter Henry, Maye's two leading targets. Both have scored in the playoffs, but they've combined for only 10 catches for 125 yards on 18 targets. Kayshon Boutte has stepped up in the pass game, and Rhamondre Stevenson has seen his role grow, but for the Patriots to string successful drives together, they might also need contributions from wideouts Demario Douglas and Kyle Williams. The Broncos forced five Buffalo turnovers last week after coaxing only 14 during the regular season, with no more than two in any game previously. The Patriots know they can't waste possessions and fall in an early hole, or Denver's pass rush could be even more of a problem.

On the surface, the Patriots would appear to have an edge in the ground game. Rookie TreVeyon Henderson has been held in check in two postseason games, but Stevenson has been highly efficient, and Maye is a weapon as a scrambler and occasional designed runner. The Broncos' rush defense was one of the best in the NFL during the regular season, allowing 91.1 rush yards per game and 3.9 yards per carry. But the Bills ran for 183 yards last week in Denver, averaging 5.1 yards per clip, and mobile quarterbacks have given Denver some issues this season. On the flip side, the Broncos have had to forge a run game since J.K. Dobbins' foot injury, most often relying on rookie RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin, along with Nix's scrambling. With Nix out, facing a tough New England front that's allowed 67.5 rush yards per game and 3.1 yards per carry in two playoff games, the challenge appears difficult, even with Denver's strong offensive line. However, there's hope that Dobbins could return after being out since Week 10. Getting him back would be a huge development in both the run and pass games, even if Harvey has been their primary receiving back this season. The Broncos could have limited pass-game weapons with a few receivers battling injuries, so adding one more veteran weapon in Dobbins – who was on pace for a 1,300-yard rushing season before getting hurt – would make everyone's job easier, especially Jarrett Stidham in the toughest test of his career.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/drcdbmqdijoeun85rbmn,N,,2026-01-22 18:40:38.164124

What does that mean?

Hollins likely won’t be activated to return this week, but opening his practice window puts him in a position to play as soon as Sunday. If not, he’ll be eligible to continue practicing and can be activated at any point until the day before Super Bowl LX.

The Patriots would certainly be eager to bring the veteran wide receiver back into the fold, as he finished third on the team in receptions (46) and fourth in receiving yards (550) despite suffering his injury and missing the final two regular season games against the New York Giants and Miami Dolphins.

The operation was conducted Tuesday in Alabama. Nix sent out a heartfelt message on his Instagram account Wednesday.

""The last few days have been hard to put into words,"" Nix wrote. ""What started as one of the most exciting games I’ve ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I’ve ever received. This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it.

""I can’t express how much this team and organization mean to me and how much I believe in them. I couldn’t be more proud of our guys. I couldn’t be more confident in Jarrett. And I couldn’t be more excited for what’s next.

""Thank you all for the kind words, love and support over the last few days. Thankful for my trainers, Beau, Vince and Dr. Waldrop for taking great care of me.

""God never says oops, and he is always good. He has big plans for this team. We’re not finished, as a matter of fact we’re just getting started. We’re just going to keep climbing higher. Go Broncos,"" Nix concluded.

Winners will be announced at NFL Honors on Thursday, Feb. 5 at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco. The show will air at 8 p.m. CT on NBC and NFL Network.

It's the latest in a series of accolades for Parsons, who earlier this month was voted first-team All-Pro as determined by a vote of 50 media members of the AP.

Acquired in an August trade with Dallas, Parsons tallied 41 tackles, 12½ sacks, 26 quarterback hits and 83 pressures, according to NFL Next Gen Stats, in 14 games with Green Bay.

Parsons tore his anterior cruciate ligament against the Denver Broncos in December but still earned a fifth consecutive Pro Bowl selection (2021-2025).

Parsons' 2½ sacks in a Thanksgiving win over Detroit made him the only NFL player (since 1982) to register 12-plus sacks in each of his first five NFL seasons (2021-25).

Not one, not two, but three Seahawks left tackles didn’t practice on Wednesday. Charles Cross, described as “day-to-day” by head coach Mike Macdonald due to a foot injury, was a DNP. Josh Jones, who didn’t play last week with a knee injury, remained held out of practice. The new injury is undrafted rookie Amari Kight, who replaced the injured Cross in last weeks’ Divisional Round romp against the San Francisco 49ers. Kight joins the knee injury brigade, which is less than ideal. The good news is the first practice is usually the one to be the least concerned about.

Everyone else practiced in either a limited or full capacity. Running back George Holani was a full go after being designated for return to practice, a clear sign he’s ready to come back and deputized for the injured Zach Charbonnet. Holani probably could’ve been brought back sooner based on this answer.

Quarterback Sam Darnold was limited, but that’s no cause for concern as it’s mostly managing that injury. The full injury report is lengthy as mentioned earlier, but daunting it is not outside of the left tackle position.

That’s what we know exists. We’ve heard that debunked. So yes, we will look into it. We have. The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We pour into it.

The 49ers have practiced in the same facility since 1988, winning three Super Bowls in the first seven years there. And even if there’s nothing to the electricity angle, the 49ers have had too many injuries in recent years.

“The health and performance of our players is at the utmost priority each and every year,” Lynch said. “You know, this year it was tough and it took a toll on our team. We’ll continue to look. Now, having said that, we’ve spent a lot of time and effort in recruiting really quality people and I think being at the forefront of injury prevention.

That, of course, ended his season and required surgery to repair, and putting him on a very long road to recovery.
Add in four fourth-quarter comebacks and three game-winning drives and it was the best showing from Prescott since 2023, when he was named finalist for NFL MVP before ending as runner-up to Lamar Jackson, one year after having been named Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2022.
That season, Prescott threw for only one fewer interception (9), six more touchdowns (36), two more first downs (222), and just 36 more passing yards on six more passing attempts.
Even more impressive was Prescott's ability to scramble, something that appeared rejuvenated despite the brutal hamstring injury suffered only months prior.","FRISCO, Texas — It goes without saying that the Dallas Cowboys didn't end their 2025 campaign in the way they had envisioned, but it's equally as obvious that Dak Prescott did all he could to try and change the team's fate. And as the calendar nears February, the All-Pro quarterback is being rewarded for his efforts in keeping the team afloat when they otherwise wouldn't have been.

Prescott has been named a finalist for the 2025 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, giving him a very real chance at adding to his growing list of achievements — also honored with his fourth Pro Bowl nod this past season.

It marks the second time Prescott has been named a finalist for the award, the first being in 2021, named runner-up at the time to Cincinnati Bengals' quarterback Joe Burrow, in a year that saw the Cowboys' quarterback return from a season-ending ankle injury that cost him a total of 11 games in 2020, then racking up career-best numbers in the season that followed.

The All-Pro was a man possessed for much of 2025, an impressive feat when considering Prescott suffered a catastrophic injury in Week 8 against the Atlanta Falcons, attempting to escape pressure to make a play, that resulted in his hamstring being torn off of the bone. That, of course, ended his season and required surgery to repair, and putting him on a very long road to recovery.

A little less than nine months later, Prescott was on the field to begin training camp — not on the team's physically unable to perform (PUP) list — igniting Oxnard as arguably the MVP of the three-week program, but that was ultimately just a taste of what was to come, and particularly with the addition of George Pickens via trade to join CeeDee Lamb.

Before the season was all said-and-done, Prescott had overtaken Tony Romo as the Cowboys’ all-time passing leader, going on to start in all 17 games en route to throwing for 4,552 passing yards (the second-highest of his career) and 30 touchdowns (tied for third-highest of his career) to only 10 interceptions (tied for second-fewest through with a minimum of 16 games played).

Add in four fourth-quarter comebacks and three game-winning drives and it was the best showing from Prescott since 2023, when he was named finalist for NFL MVP before ending as runner-up to Lamar Jackson, one year after having been named Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2022.

That season, Prescott threw for only one fewer interception (9), six more touchdowns (36), two more first downs (222), and just 36 more passing yards on six more passing attempts. Even more impressive was Prescott's ability to scramble, something that appeared rejuvenated despite the brutal hamstring injury suffered only months prior.

He rushed for 177 yards and two touchdowns, numbers that were also comparable to 2023, along with 15 first downs that kept the chains moving in critical moments — also using his legs to extend plays that eventually turned into downfield highlights for Lamb, Pickens and others.

If he walks away with this year's NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, it will mark only the second time a Cowboys' player has won it, the first being former Pro Bowl edge rusher Greg Ellis, when he earned the honor for his work that produced 12.5 sacks in 2007, after his return from a torn Achilles suffered in 2006.

Prescott enters this offseason with a chip on his shoulder, but also fully healthy, and in top form to try and power the Cowboys through to a better outcome in 2026.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/br7bjrzcn1viikknjtvm,N,,2026-01-22 09:39:21.808731

That even includes fan theories, one of which has taken the internet by storm this year.

After an X post from a self-described “board-certified quantum biology practitioner” pointing to the electrical substation next to the 49ers' practice facility in Santa Clara went viral earlier this month, amassing 22.2 million views, president of football operations/general manager John Lynch told reporters during his end-of-season press conference with coach Kyle Shanahan that the team is looking into whether it could be tied to the team's injuries this season.

""What I would tell you, because it deals with allegedly the health and safety of our players, I think you have to look into everything"" Lynch said. ""So, our guys have been, we've been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and by coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means. That's what we know exists. We've heard that debunked.

""So yes, we will look into it. We have. The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We pour into it. Our ownership, [CEO] Jed [York], tremendous in terms of resources and we'll always be cognizant of things. I know that a lot of games have been won at this facility since it opened. We aren't going to turn a blind eye. We'll look into everything.""

It's clear the 49ers are doing their due diligence when it comes to the theory, which some have dismissed as pure conspiracy fiction and others -- including players -- believe could provide reason for the 49ers' injuries. Several NFL agents told The Washington Post last week that the theory is gaining steam with their clients.

In that same Post article, Frank de Vocht, a professor of epidemiology and public health at Bristol Medical School in England and a leading expert on how EMF affects humans, referred to the theory as ""nonsense,"" and Hans Kromhout, a Utrecht University professor of exposure assessment and occupational hygiene, called it ""quite unlikely.""

Substation-caused or not, the 49ers are aware that their rash of injuries to stars like Nick Bosa, Fred Warner and George Kittle, as well as past injuries, are a clear problem - and they'll look into whatever they can to help alleviate the issue.

""Yeah, we're always looking into trends, data, everything we do,"" Lynch said of the injury-plagued 49ers. ""The health and performance of our players is at the utmost priority each and every year. You know, this year it was tough and it took a toll on our team. We'll continue to look. Now, having said that, we've spent a lot of time and effort in recruiting really quality people and I think being at the forefront of injury prevention. I think this year probably because the star players that that went down there was a lot of attention given on that.

""The fact of the matter is injuries are a part of this game. And so, what we strive to do is never to eliminate injuries, but to mitigate injuries, and I think we have a lot of good processes. We'll challenge them all. That process has begun. It never frankly stopped, but yes, we'll look at everything and we'll examine everything.""",https://media.nbcsportsbayarea.com/2026/01/john-lynch-kyle-shanahan-GettyImages-2228678630-e1769042764492.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-22 12:40:05.521566

For NFL football players, disability insurance for athletes exists at the intersection of physical risk and financial reality.","Disability Insurance for athletes sits at the center of income protection for NFL football players whose careers can end instantly after a single hit. Professional football exposes players to repeated collisions that place future earnings at risk long before most workers reach peak income years. Unlike salaried professions, NFL income depends on continued physical performance, and when that performance stops, paychecks often stop with it.

The average NFL career spans only a small number of seasons, yet many players enter the league with financial expectations tied to long-term earning potential. Contracts are frequently structured with limited guarantees, meaning injuries can terminate salary, bonuses, and roster status at once.

Studies of the NFL labor market show that severe injuries shorten careers and permanently reduce lifetime earnings, even for players who reach elite levels of performance, researchers report.

Income loss does not occur only at retirement. An ACL tear, spinal injury, or concussion history can reduce playing time, limit future contracts, or force early exit from the league. These losses often arrive without warning, leaving little time to replace earnings that were expected to last several more seasons.

Disability insurance differs from medical coverage because it is designed to replace income rather than pay treatment bills. For NFL football players, whose occupation depends entirely on physical ability, disability insurance focuses on what happens when the ability to play is lost, not just when injuries occur. That distinction becomes critical when an injury permanently ends a player’s earning capacity on the field.

NFL Injury Risk and Long-Term Threat to Player Income

Injury risk in professional football does not end when a player leaves the field for the last time. Former NFL players face elevated rates of chronic pain, joint disease, depression, and cognitive symptoms that can interfere with post-football employment. These conditions can limit a former player’s ability to earn income in coaching, broadcasting, business, or other second careers, medical researchers report.

Long-term data shows that health risks rise with additional years of play. “Having a longer NFL career significantly increased risk of cognitive impairment and depression later in life,” researchers reported, noting that “with each additional five years of play, the risk for self-reported cognitive impairment increased by 20%,” according to the Football Players Health Study at Harvard University.

Neurological symptoms create particular financial strain because they may worsen gradually rather than appear immediately after retirement. Cognitive problems, headaches, and mood instability can limit a former player’s ability to maintain steady work even when physical injuries appear manageable. These symptoms often emerge years after playing careers end, complicating income planning.

A large study of nearly 2,000 former NFL players found that about one-third believed they had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and those players reported significantly higher rates of cognitive problems, depression, suicidality, and chronic pain than peers without those concerns, investigators reported.

NFL Disability Benefits and Limits of League Coverage

NFL players are eligible for disability benefits through plans administered by the league and the NFL Players Association. These benefits provide monthly payments under specific disability classifications and eligibility criteria outlined in plan documents. Coverage varies based on service time, medical evidence, and disability determinations.

However, league benefits operate within standardized limits that may not reflect individual earning trajectories. A player with high projected future income may receive the same benefit level as a peer with shorter expected earnings, leaving a portion of income unprotected if a career ends early.

Disability claims under league plans can also involve administrative review processes that take time to resolve. Conditions that worsen gradually, such as neurological or musculoskeletal disorders, can be especially difficult to evaluate under strict definitions of disability.

Because of these structural limits, some players rely on individual disability insurance policies that are designed around expected earnings and occupation-specific risk. These policies focus on replacing income tied to playing ability rather than providing a flat benefit unrelated to prior compensation.

Medical Evidence Links NFL Careers to Long-Term Disability Risk

Researchers studying former NFL players emphasize that many symptoms attributed to irreversible brain disease may also stem from treatable conditions.

“Many conditions common to former NFL players, such as sleep apnea, low testosterone, high blood pressure, and chronic pain, can cause problems with thinking, memory, and concentration,” said Rachel Grashow, first author of the Harvard-led study examining CTE concerns among former players.

While CTE cannot be diagnosed during life, researchers caution that uncertainty itself can create emotional and financial stress. “While we wait for advances in CTE research to better address living players’ experiences, it is imperative that we identify conditions that are treatable,” Grashow added, noting that misattributing symptoms can lead to hopelessness and worsen mental health outcomes.

From an income protection perspective, uncertainty around long-term health can directly affect employability. Cognitive symptoms, chronic pain, and mental health challenges may limit a former player’s ability to sustain post-football income, even when physical injuries appear less visible. These risks compound the financial impact of early career endings.

For NFL football players, disability insurance for athletes exists at the intersection of physical risk and financial reality. When careers end earlier than expected and long-term health remains uncertain, income protection becomes less about planning for retirement and more about managing sudden and lasting loss of earning capacity.

Nix has opened up in a letter for the first time since he was diagnosed with the injury.

“What started as one of the most exciting games I’ve ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I’ve ever received. This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined byovercoming adversity and responding to it,” Nix wrote.

With Nix out for the remainder of the postseason, Jarrett Stidham will be the next man up as the starting quarterback, and everybody has the ultimate belief in him to get the job done.

“I can’t express how much this team and organization mean to me and how much I believe in them. I couldn’t be more proud of our guys. I couldn’t be more confident in Jarrett. And I couldn’t be more excited for what’s next,” Nix wrote.

The Broncos had a great regular season, and though it was their defense that led them through the way, Nix and the offense held their own. In his second season, Nix finished with 3,291 passing yards, 25 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.

Now, the Broncos may have to rely on their defense even more against the New England Patriots if they want a chance in the AFC Championship Game. The Patriots also don’t have much information on Stidham, so that could either work in the Broncos’ favor or it could hurt them since he hasn’t gotten many reps as QB1 throughout his career.

In the end, it was a great season for Nix, and he did all he could to help the Broncos get to where they are now. It’s up to the team to finish the job.

Spurs are continuing to assess Bergvall to determine his recovery timescale.

The 19-year-old played 62 minutes in Tuesday’s Champions League game against Borussia Dortmund before being forced off after a tackle with an injury. The Sweden international was replaced by Jun’ai Byfield, who was making his senior club debut.

“It was a contact (injury), and they are assessing him now, so we will know more on Thursday,” Frank told TNT Sports on Tuesday after the win over Dortmund.

Bergvall has been disrupted by injuries in recent months, having missed three games in November with concussion before missing the recent Premier League draw at Brentford and FA Cup defeat to Aston Villa through injury.

Spurs already have a long-term absentee list including James Maddison, Mohammed Kudus, Richarlison, Dejan Kulusevski, Ben Davies, and Rodrigo Bentancur, while Joao Palhinha has also missed the most recent two matches with a knock picked up in training.

Frank’s squad has been strengthened this month with the arrival of Conor Gallagher from Atletico Madrid.

Bergvall will be hoping to be available for Sweden for their World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine on March 26 and possible final five days later.

Analysis by The Athletic’s Jack Pitt-Brooke

The news that Lucas Bergvall is set for another spell on the sidelines with an ankle injury has come at a bad time for Tottenham.

Midfield has been an issue all season for Spurs, but even more so recently because of injuries. Rodrigo Bentancur, who had been Tottenham’s most reliable midfielder, underwent hamstring surgery earlier this month and will be out for a significant period of time. James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, of course, are both recovering from knee operations of their own.

Bergvall has been in and out of the team recently and had only just recovered from a groin injury when he sustained this new problem against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday.

Frank will now be without Bergvall’s energy and tenacity in the next period of games. Spurs have already bought Conor Gallagher this window, a reaction in part to Bentancur’s hamstring injury.

And many fans will now wonder if they have to go back into the market again in the last week of the window to find another available midfielder.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/21172206/GettyImages-2254519833-scaled-e1769079105528.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-22 09:39:29.654270

Much of Lynch’s optimism about Kittle’s path back to the field is based on how recovery has improved since his playing days. Achilles tears used to be a death knell for players’ careers, but sports medicine practices have improved greatly over the last 30 years.

“I remember when I first started playing, you had an Achilles and everybody's like -- ‘Oh man, that's tough, you're never the same.’ That's not the case anymore,” Lynch said. “I think like a lot of things, they've gotten much better at the surgeries.”

“They've gotten much better and more aggressive in the rehab and how quickly you get after it. And I think that will be the case for George.”

Kittle, 32, finished the 2025 season with 628 receiving yards on 69 receptions. He missed five of the 49ers’ first six games with a hamstring injury, and missed Week 17 against the Chicago Bears with an ankle sprain.

The six total games this season were the most Kittle has missed in a season since 2020.

“We expect to have him back next year and [be] a big impact like he always has been for us,” Lynch said.",https://media.nbcsportsbayarea.com/2026/01/LYNCH-KITTLE-USATSI.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-22 04:39:46.724431

“I don’t think Bo Nix is heavily regarded as an elite quarterback in the league or a true game-changer,” Feazel said.
“This is not like a Super Bowl where it’s very artificial the way the crowd is and all the hoopla.
The four most recent teams to accomplish that went to win the Super Bowl.
NFC title game winner a Super Bowl favorite BetMGM and Caesars list the Seahawks and Rams as two leading favorites to win the Super Bowl.","LAS VEGAS (AP) — Denver would be a slight favorite if quarterback Bo Nix was healthy and ready to play Sunday in the AFC championship game, but the Broncos instead are fairly substantial underdogs to New England.

It’s a development that has caused some head shaking in the sports betting industry.

The Broncos would be about 1 1/2-point favorites in the AFC championship game, but as of Wednesday afternoon, the Patriots were favored by 5 points at BetMGM Sportsbook and 4 1/2 at Caesars Sportsbook.

“Typically, a quarterback is worth about four points to the line,” BetMGM sports trader Christian Cipollini said. “This line movement based off that opening line is pretty close to six or seven, which I find pretty interesting. I personally think as we get closer to kickoff, it’ll come back closer to the Broncos. I think this will close maybe 3 1/2, 4, but we’ll see what happens.”

Nix is out for the remainder of the postseason after breaking his right ankle late in Saturday’s 33-30 victory over Buffalo in the divisional playoffs round. Jarrett Stidham, who last started a game in 2023, will take his place.

Joey Feazel, head of football at Caesars, said he was surprised to see such a significant line movement.

“I don’t think Bo Nix is heavily regarded as an elite quarterback in the league or a true game-changer,” Feazel said. “Obviously, he made some really good throws this past weekend and has been consistent throughout the year.”

CBS SportsLine handicapper Bruce Marshall is a buyer on the Broncos. He likes Denver coach Sean Payton’s history of getting quality play out of his backup quarterbacks going back to his days in New Orleans.

“I think they’ve inflated this line too much,” Marshall said. “This is not like a Super Bowl where it’s very artificial the way the crowd is and all the hoopla. This is still like a regular game and it’s in Denver, where they are very tough to beat. I think Denver’s going to win this game and we’ll see what happens in the Super Bowl.”

Seahawks slight favorites over Rams

If the point spread — 2 1/2 points at BetMGM and Caesars in favor of Seattle — is to be believed, the Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams should play another tense game when they meet in the NFC championship game.

They split the regular-season meetings, with the Rams winning 21-19 at home and the Seahawks 38-37 in Seattle. LA blew a 16-point fourth-quarter lead in the rematch before falling in overtime.

Cipollini said three times more betting action has come in on the Seahawks.

“If you do like the Seahawks, right now is the time to get on,” Cipollini said. “Any sharps (professional bettors) that are on the Seahawks are going to want to take them at 2 1/2. Just judging where this number is, if anything, it feels it can possibly get to 3.”

Feazel noted the Rams were favored just a month ago when they played at Seattle.

“Week in, week out, there’s some recency bias that goes into the lines,” Feazel said. “What have you done for me lately and what did we see last week and expect the same thing. That’s what makes the NFL so great.”

Rams with the road advantage?

Lumen Field has provided a notable home-field advantage for the Seahawks.

Even so, the Rams were in position to win the regular-season meeting there, and they won both their playoff games on the road so far this postseason.

The Rams and quarterback Matthew Stafford will attempt to become the sixth team to win three road games in one postseason. The four most recent teams to accomplish that went to win the Super Bowl.

“I almost think the Rams are better off playing on the road,” Marshall said. “Even at home, a lot of times almost half the fans are for the other team. They’re the only team I think can go into Seattle and have a chance against this defense.”

Another test for Darnold

Sam Darnold struggled earlier in his career until a breakout season with Minnesota in 2024, but he now is the only quarterback to lead two different teams to consecutive 14-win seasons.

The eight-year veteran finally earned his first playoff victory Saturday, a 41-6 win over banged-up San Francisco.

NFC title game winner a Super Bowl favorite

BetMGM and Caesars list the Seahawks and Rams as two leading favorites to win the Super Bowl.

Seattle or Los Angeles would be favored by a field goal or more over the Patriots in the big game and by at least 7 1/2 points over the Broncos.

Here are some of the top moments and defining characteristics of the Patriots' Super Bowl legacy, as shared by Redditors:

Super Bowl LI Comeback (28-3 vs. Falcons)

The Patriots' comeback from a 28-3 deficit against the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI is widely considered the greatest in Super Bowl history.

Edelman's Miraculous Catch: A pivotal play that kept the Patriots' drive alive. ""The slowmo of the Edelman catch is always so insane to me"" and ""The Edelman catch was sacred healing.""

Hightower's Sack and James White's Performance: Key defensive and offensive plays that turned the tide. ""Hightower had a similar quote when someone asked him if he was upset he didn’t make the pro bowl. 'We’re in the ring business'"" and ""James White robbed of MVP"".

Falcons' Collapse: Critics point to the Falcons' play-calling as a major factor in their loss. ""Still so mind-blowing that the Falcons could fuck up so badly."" and ""Throwing on 3rd and 1 up 16 with 8 minutes to go in the game was certainly a choice"".

Brady's Leadership: Many believe the comeback was only possible due to Tom Brady's experience and leadership. ""I genuinely don't think this comeback is possible without Brady having such a history of doing this stuff."".

The ""Ring Business"" Mentality

The Patriots organization and its players are often characterized by their focus on winning championships above all else.

Prioritizing Rings over Individual Honors: ""We went to 13 AFC championship games in an 18 year span. It’s easier to reference the 6 rings."" and ""You think I play this shit to go to Probowls?"".

Consistent Success: The Patriots' ability to consistently reach and compete in the Super Bowl is a testament to their organizational strength. ""I had moved to the Boston area a few years prior but have never been a fan of Boston teams... The level of noise I heard in my neighborhood just from the cheering at the end of this game is unmatched."".

Future Prospects

While the Patriots have faced challenges in recent years, there's still hope for future success.

Drake Maye and Future Potential: Some fans believe in the potential of new players to bring the team back to Super Bowl contention. ""Drake Maye is an elite QB and Vrabel is a great coach but the supporting cast isn't top tier."".

The money raised goes directly to the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation dedicated to curing spinal cord injury, the Michael J. Fox Foundation committed to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease and SCIboston's Travis Roy Legacy Grant that assists individuals with paraplegia or quad/tetraplegia caused by spinal cord injury or disorder.

In addition, Tampa-based charitable organizations pdLIFE, which helps patients with Parkinson's disease, and Stay In Step Brain & Spinal Cord Injury Recovery Center will receive funding from the Go Forward! event.

""This is our biggest night,"" NHL Foundation U.S. executive director Rob Wooley said. ""The NHL Foundation has never raised a half a million dollars ever at one time.""

The NHL Foundation will also host the Travis Roy Hockey Classic at Benchmark International Arena in Tampa on Feb. 1, hours before the 2026 Navy Federal Credit Union NHL Stadium Series between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Boston Bruins at Raymond James Stadium, home of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6:30 p.m. ET; ESPN, SN, TVAS).

Players each had to raise at least $5,000 to play in the event, which is expected to raise about $150,000.

""Our work is rooted in a simple belief that hockey has the power to change lives,"" Wooley said. ""Go Forward! is about making sure families facing spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's and long journeys of recovery don't walk those roads alone.

""Tuesday night, this community stepped up in a big way. We're proud to have raised about $600,000 to help fuel research, rehabilitation and support for the organizations doing that work every day. And we're already looking forward to building on that momentum next year.""

As part of the Go Forward! event, the NHL Foundation presented awards to Josh Pauls, a four-time U.S. Paralympic gold medalist in sled hockey, and Lee and Brenda Roy, parents of the late Travis Roy, a forward who sustained a spinal cord injury 11 seconds into his first shift of his debut with Boston University on Oct. 20, 1995, that left him paralyzed from the neck down.

Pauls received the NHL Foundation U.S. Athlete Leadership Award. The Roys received the NHL Foundation U.S. Advocacy Impact Award.

""This is our first truly large fundraising event, and we couldn't be more proud to be honoring such amazing organizations,"" said Kim Davis, the NHL Foundation U.S. president and NHL senior executive vice president of social impact, growth initiatives and legislative affairs. ""The NHL Foundation is really about using the sport of hockey to help build strong and more vibrant communities and the work that we do is never done alone.

In attendance were NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly, Hockey Hall of Famers Cam Neely and Brendan Shanahan, 1980 United States Olympic gold medalists Rob McClanahan and Buzz Schneider, former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason, and several retired NHL players.

""He's not going to be a full-go the whole week, so we have a plan; we're going to work through it, see how the day goes and then we'll kind of take it day by day and take it to tomorrow,"" Macdonald said Wednesday. ""But he won't be throwing every ball every play for the whole week, no.""

The Seahawks listed Darnold as a limited participant Wednesday. Their first injury report of the week also listed their top three left tackles -- Charles Cross, Josh Jones and Amari Kight -- as nonparticipants.

Darnold suffered the injury to his left oblique in practice Thursday and played through it Saturday against the San Francisco 49ers, completing 12 of 17 attempts for 124 yards, a touchdown and zero turnovers. He was pulled with over nine minutes remaining in the fourth quarter with the top-seeded Seahawks on their way to a 41-6 win in the divisional round.

Darnold said Wednesday he ""felt good"" a day after that game and that he was ""feeling really good"" three days later as the Seahawks began preparations to host the Rams in their third meeting of the season against their NFC West rivals.

""Just attacking rehab these last couple days,"" he said. ""Obviously will be throughout the week. ... I've just got to continue to prepare and get my body right for Sunday.""

Cross -- Seattle's starting left tackle who just signed a four-year, $104.4 million extension -- left in the third quarter Saturday with a foot injury. He missed the final three regular-season games with a hamstring injury and also hurt a knee in practice leading up to the divisional round game against the 49ers.

Seattle's Wednesday injury report listed a foot ailment for Cross as the reason he didn't practice. Jones missed the 49ers game because of knee and ankle injuries he played through in Week 18 while filling in for Cross. Kight, an undrafted rookie, replaced Cross on Saturday but is now listed as having a knee injury.

Logan Brown, another undrafted rookie, is Seattle's No. 4 left tackle.

Macdonald announced Monday that the Seahawks will be without Zach Charbonnet for the remainder of their playoff run after the third-year running back suffered a significant knee injury against the 49ers. Charbonnet, one half of Seattle's two-man rushing attack along with Kenneth Walker III, will need surgery.

The Seahawks on Wednesday designated George Holani to return to practice. He began the season as Seattle's third running back but has been on injured reserve since hurting a hamstring in Week 12.

Seattle's other backup tailbacks are Velus Jones Jr. and former Ram Cam Akers, who won Super Bowl LVI with Los Angeles.

Holani was a full participant Wednesday. Macdonald answered in the affirmative when asked if it's realistic that he could play Sunday.

""Yeah, George is in great shape,"" he said. ""Working his tail off. Excited to get him out there. Haven't seen him practice in a minute, so it'll be fun.""

The Seahawks are 2.5-point favorites in the NFC Championship Game.

They lost the first meeting 21-19 at SoFi Stadium in November, missing a 61-yard field goal that would have won the game despite four Darnold interceptions. The Seahawks came from behind to beat Los Angeles 38-37 in an overtime thriller at Lumen Field in Week 16, as Darnold shook off two more interceptions to help rally Seattle from a 16-point deficit in the fourth quarter.

""Really good team, really good defense, really good scheme,"" Darnold said. ""Good players. So like always, we're really excited about this opportunity to play these guys. We've just got to have a really good week of practice. For me, I've got to continue to attack all the things that I need to attack, just get ready to play these guys, but also just getting my body right to be ready for Sunday.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0116%2Fr1601609_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:42:17.006051

As Patriots coach Mike Vrabel announced earlier in the day, cornerback Carlton Davis, who is currently in concussion protocol from the injury he suffered in last week's divisional playoff game, practiced in a limited capacity.

The fact that Davis was already on the field in a red non-contact jersey bodes well for his chances of playing on Sunday. It means he's further along in the concussion protocol with a real shot at being available for the road trip to Denver.

There's hope that wide receiver Mack Hollins will be available as well. He is currently dealing with an abdominal injury that has kept him sidelined since the Patriots' Week 16 meeting with the Baltimore Ravens. Vrabel announced that the team wasn't going to open the injured reserve window for Hollins on Wednesday.

It was the first time he's made any type of public comment about his injury since the 33-30 overtime win at Mile High.

Nix was scheduled to undergo surgery a day before for a broken bone in his ankle. In his Instagram post, he thanked his doctor in Alabama who performed the operation.

""Thank you all for the kind words, love and support over the last few days. Thankful for my trainers, Beau, Vince and Dr. Waldrop for taking great care of me,"" Nix wrote.

Nix could be seen on CBS's broadcast walking around on the sideline after getting hurt on one of the final plays. Dr. Landon Fine, an orthopedic surgeon at AdventHealth Parker, said that's not surprising.

""Immediately it hurts to break a bone, obviously. Initially he was able to walk around. But once the swelling and the bleeding and things do what they do, it becomes more symptomatic,"" Fine said.

Nix also wrote about his religious beliefs and how they're guiding him through his recovery, saying ""God never says oops."" He said he believes God has ""big plans for this team.""

Jarrett Stidham will be starting at QB for Denver in the AFC Championship this weekend, and Nix had words of encouragement for his teammate who will now be leading the huddle.

""I couldn't be more confident in Jarrett,"" he wrote.

So far there's no announced timeline for when Nix will be able to begin practicing again for the team, but Fine said that he expects ""after a couple months he'll be back out there.""

The theory was mentioned by receiver Kendrick Bourne after tight end George Kittle tore his right Achilles during the 49ers' wild card playoff win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

Specifically, 49ers general manager John Lynch said the team will investigate a viral conspiracy theory that the electrical substation near their training facility and Levi's Stadium is having an impact on the team's injuries. The substation (which is operated by Silicon Valley Power) expanded in 2014 with the opening of Levi's Stadium.

The theory was mentioned by receiver Kendrick Bourne after tight end George Kittle tore his right Achilles during the 49ers' wild card playoff win over the Philadelphia Eagles. And while the theory has been debunked by scientists and other medial professionals, the 49ers aren't taking anything to chance.

""We've been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see, does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means? That's what we know exists,"" 49ers general manager John Lynch said, via ESPN. ""We've heard that debunked. ... The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We pore into it. Our ownership, Jed [York] is tremendous in terms of resources and we'll always be cognizant of things. I know that a lot of games have been won at this facility since it opened, but yeah, we aren't going to turn a blind eye.""

Given their injury numbers in recent years, it's easy to see why the 49ers will at least do their due diligence to look into this theory. This season, the 49ers dealt with significant injuries to several key players, including Kittle, pass rusher Nick Bosa (torn ACL), linebacker Fred Warner (fractured and dislocated ankle), quarterback Brock Purdy (turf toe) and rookie pass rusher Mykel Williams (torn ACL).

Despite those and other injuries, the 49ers went 12-5 during the regular season while playing in the NFL's toughest division. But if the 49ers want to win their first Super Bowl since 1994, they're going to have to find a way to get more of their players to the finish line.

With that in mind, Lynch said the 49ers will look over their entire process this offseason in an effort to have a healthier team moving forward.

""The fact of the matter is injuries are a part of this game,"" Lynch said. ""What we strive to do is never to eliminate injuries, but to mitigate injuries. And I think we have a lot of good processes. We'll challenge them all. And that process has begun. It never frankly stopped.

Linebackers Harold Landry III and Marte Mapu stayed sidelined during Wednesday’s practice inside the WIN Waste Innovations Field House. But a handful were limited as sights set on the Denver Broncos, including cornerback Carlton Davis III, who entered the NFL’s concussion protocol late in the divisional round.

Here’s the first injury report ahead of Sunday’s 3 p.m. ET kickoff at Empower Field.

Landry has been managing a knee injury since the midway mark in the regular season. The defensive captain and sack leader began the week of the divisional round with back-to-back limited practices before sitting out on Friday and earning a questionable game status. He saw 11 out of 75 defensive snaps from there against the Houston Texans. As for Mapu, the core linebacker handled 58 percent of the workload on special teams in the 28-16 win at Gillette Stadium.

Officially among five partial participants in Foxborough, Davis headed to the locker room and was ruled out in the closing minutes last Sunday. The veteran corner turned in four tackles, including one for loss, along with two interceptions and two pass breakups before then. He is trending in the right direction ahead of the matchup with a new starting quarterback at Mile High.

A week after opening Jennings’ 21-day activation window, the Patriots opened Farmer’s. The rookie defensive tackle sustained a hamstring injury in December and was a full participant in his first practice back.

The Broncos head coach sung the praises of backup Jarrett Stidham Wednesday as Denver prepares to face the New England Patriots.

In fact, Payton says he believes that Stidham is a starting-level NFL quarterback.

""I felt like our two [QBs] were inside the best 32,"" Payton said, per Troy Renck of the Denver Post. ""I am glad that acquisition took place.”

If Stidham is a top-32 quarterback, Payton knows something that the rest of the league doesn't. Stidham is a career backup who hasn't thrown a pass since the 2023 season.

It's not all bad news for the Broncos

The good news for the Broncos is that Stidham won't be going in completely cold. Stidham joined the Broncos as a free agent in 2023, Payton's first season as Denver's head coach. He's been practicing in Payton's system for three seasons.

The Broncos will be counting on that familiarity and comfort level with the Denver offense against a Patriots defense that sacked Herbert six times in the wild-card round and intercepted Stroud four times last week in the divisional round.

It would be a daunting task for Nix, much less a quarterback in Stidham who's made four career NFL starts. And practice experience, obviously, doesn't equate to a playoff atmosphere with a trip to the Super Bowl at stake.

Stidham: It's just another game

Stidham said on Wednesday that he's taking the approach that it's just another game.

""What I always go back to — in any game — regular season, preseason, AFC championship — it’s still the same game,"" Stidham told reporters. ""Obviously there’s implications — winner advances, and all that kind of stuff. But at the end of the day, it’s still football. And that’s how I view it.

""I’m not treating it any differently. I’m not treating my preparation any differently. I’m just gonna go out there and play and be myself.""

He sounds confident. And that's certainly what you want to hear if you're Payton or a Broncos fan.

Broncos are built to win without elite QB play

The Broncos have a team that doesn't depend on high-level quarterback play to win. Denver earned the AFC's No. 1 seed on the strength of a defense that finished second in yards allowed and third in points allowed (18.3 per game) this season.

The offense was no slouch and finished in the top half of the league in yards and points per game (23.6). But the Broncos neither depended on nor received elite quarterback play from Nix.

Nix's passer rating (87.8) was below league average (91.4) and ranked 27th among quarterbacks who started eight games or more. His completion percentage (63.4%) and yards per attempt (6.43) both took a slight dip from his rookie campaign as he threw for 25 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.

Nix's best attribute, arguably, was his play late in close games. Thanks in part to not having an offense that pulled away from opponents, the Broncos found themselves repeatedly in tight games in the fourth quarter. More often than not, Nix found a way to make the plays the Broncos needed in those situations, including a late go-ahead touchdown pass against the Bills last week that ultimately forced overtime in Denver's 33-30 divisional round win.

Nix addressed that finish and his confidence in Stidham Wednesday in an Instagram post that included his first public comments since learning of the season-ending ankle injury he sustained at the end of the win over Buffalo.

“This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it,” Nix wrote. “I can’t express how much this team and organization mean to me and how much I believe in them.

""I couldn’t be more proud of our guys. I couldn’t be more confident in Jarrett. And I couldn’t be more excited for what’s next.”

Confidence exudes from the Broncos' practice facility despite Nix's injury. But what ultimately matters is what that confidence looks like when the whistle blows on Sunday.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ynqBYYBxiLX8xpzuSWWqOA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MTQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/c3c92ce0-f4d8-11f0-a3df-5966d2ace387,N,,2026-01-22 00:42:45.125392

None of Seattle’s top three options at left tackle – starter Charles Cross and reserves Josh Jones and Amari Kight – participated in practice Wednesday due to injury concerns.

There’s an area of Rams’ offense Seattle Seahawks can exploit

Cross returned for last week’s divisional round win over the San Francisco 49ers after missing the final three games of the regular season with a hamstring injury, but a knee issue was added to the injury report last week. Now he’s dealing with a foot injury.

Jones was out all of last week and missed the 49ers game with a knee injury. On Wednesday’s practice report, he was listed with both knee and ankle injuries. Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald had said earlier Wednesday that Jones was not expected to practice.

Kight, an undrafted rookie from Alabama and Central Florida, has a knee injury. He played well in 17 offensive snaps and seven special teams snaps last weekend.

The Seahawks had a whopping 14 players on Wednesday’s injury report, though three were limited for rest reasons – linebacker Demarcus Lawrence, wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and defensive end Leonard Williams.

Quarterback Sam Darnold remained limited in practice with an oblique injury that he first encountered last week in practice. The other limited players were guard Bryce Cabeldue (knee), linebacker Uchenna Nwosu (hamstring) and fullback Robbie Ouzts (neck).

Injury Updates: How Seahawks will handle Darnold this week

The best news for Seattle is that running back George Holani was a full participant in his first practice after being designated to return from injured reserve earlier in the day from a hamstring injury. The Seahawks no doubt would like to see Holani, their typical No. 3 RB, return this week following No. 2 RB Zach Charbonnet’s season-ending ACL tear suffered against the 49ers.

Other Seahawks listed as full participants were linebacker Tyrice Knight (knee), tight end Elijah Arroyo (knee) and linebacker Chazz Surratt (ankle). Arroyo and Surratt were both designated to return from IR in the past two weeks but have yet to be activated back onto the active roster.

The Rams’ injury report was a fraction in size of Seattle’s on Wednesday with just four players listed. Safety Quentin Lake (illness) and linebacker Byron Young (knee) did not participate, cornerback Emmanuel Forbes (shoulder) was limited, and linebacker Josaiah Stewart (knee) was a full participant.

Sunday’s NFC Championship at Seattle’s Lumen Field is set for a 3:30 p.m. kickoff, with radio coverage on Seattle Sports beginning at 12:30 with the pregame show.

After rushing for 1,016 yards and earning Pro Bowl honors for the second time in his career in 2024, Joe Mixon landed on the non-football injury list before 2025 kicked off. His roster designation did not change throughout the regular season or postseason.

On Wednesday, Houston Texans general manager Nick Caserio addressed Mixon's status for the 2026 season, saying the running back continues to work through a ""freak"" foot injury.

""We haven't seen Joe in a little bit, so I think at some point we'll see him and then we'll be able to evaluate kind of where he is and then based on information, we'll see where his status is,"" Caserio said.

During last year's training camp, the Texans announced Mixon sustained a foot injury away from the facility in the offseason. The team was largely mum on the details of the running back's recovery throughout the season.

Caserio gave a partial explanation Wednesday, stopping short of revealing the injury.

PATRIOTS RETURN TO AFC CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER FORCING 5 TEXANS TURNOVERS IN HEAVY WINTRY MIX

""It wasn't like he was riding a snowmobile or anything like that,"" Caserio said. ""It was more of a medical condition or situation that never ... really didn't improve maybe as much as everybody would have hoped. I'm not trying to evade the question, that's the reality of the situation. He didn't jump off a building. He wasn't cliff diving or anything. He wasn't doing anything irresponsible. It was just a freak thing.""

The Texans reached the divisional round of the NFL playoffs for a third straight season, but five turnovers against the New England Patriots ultimately ended Houston's hopes of advancing to the AFC Championship.

The Texans’ offense took a noticeable hit with Mixon out all season due to the injury. Mixon has one year remaining on a three-year, $27 million contract extension he signed after joining the Texans following seven years with the Cincinnati Bengals.

Caserio said they were not sure of his status throughout the season but held out hope that he could return at some point.

""It was a very unique situation,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody really had any clarity, honestly, from the start of the year until now. I'd say Joe worked very, very hard to try to get himself ready to play football, it just never manifested itself, came to fruition. So probably have an opportunity to kind of see where he is in the offseason relative to next year.""

With Mixon out this season, the Texans relied on rookie Woody Marks and veteran running back Nick Chubb. Marks, a fourth-round pick, led the team with 703 yards rushing and Chubb added 506 yards.

When asked specifically if they believe Mixon's condition will improve enough for him to be ready for the start of training camp, Caserio said it's too soon to tell.

""We'll see. Believe me, I'm not smart enough to be a doctor so I'm going to leave that up to the medical experts,"" he said. ""Once we ... get a little bit more clarity, more information, we'll kind of see where we are.""

As his team prepares for Sunday's AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots, Nix summed up his emotions in a lengthy Instagram post. Nix called the injury ""some of the most devastating football news"" he's ever received. And while he is struggling with the notion of not being on the field with his teammates, Nix is confident the Broncos are still capable of winning with backup Jarrett Stidham leading the offense.

The last few days have been hard to put into words.

What started as one of the most exciting games I've ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I've ever received. This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it.

I can't express how much this team and organization mean to me and how much I believe in them. I couldn't be more proud of our guys. I couldn't be more confident in Jarrett. And I couldn't be more excited for what's next.

Thank you all for the kind words, love and support over the last few days. Thankful for my trainers, Beau, Vince and Dr. Waldrop for taking great care of me.

God never says oops, and he is always good. He has big plans for this team. We're not finished, as a matter of fact we're just getting started. We're just going to keep climbing higher.

Go Broncos.

Nix's injury halted what would have been an intriguing showdown between two of the league's rising young quarterbacks with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye on the other sideline.

Members of the 2024 NFL Draft class, Maye and Nix have enjoyed fast starts to their careers. Nix helped the Broncos snap their 10-year drought without a playoff appearance as a rookie. This past Sunday, he led Denver to its first postseason victory since its win over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50.

While his team didn't have much success in 2024, Maye did earn Pro Bowl honors after completing an impressive 66.6% of his passes. This year, he led the NFL with a 72% completion percentage while leading the Patriots to their first 14-win season since 2016.

While Nix and Maye won't get the chance to match wits on Sunday, there is another point of intrigue in Stidham trying to join the surprisingly long list of backup quarterbacks who have led their teams to the big game. That list includes Jeff Hostetler, the former New York Giants quarterback who helped Bill Parcells win his fourth Super Bowl with Big Blue.

That's what we know exists. We've heard that debunked. ... The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We pore into it. Our ownership, Jed [York] is tremendous in terms of resources and we'll always be cognizant of things. I know that a lot of games have been won at this facility since it opened, but yeah, we aren't going to turn a blind eye.""

The theory that has been making the rounds on the internet and has crept its way into the 49ers locker room -- receiver Kendrick Bourne alluded to it after tight end George Kittle tore his right Achilles in the playoff game against Philadelphia -- suggests the Niners' lengthy injury list over the past decade-plus can be attributed, in part, to excessive exposure to electromotive force (EMF).

The 49ers have trained in Santa Clara since the late 1980s with the substation coming in a few years later. The station, which is operated by Silicon Valley Power, expanded in 2014 in conjunction with the opening of Levi's Stadium.

The theory has been shot down by various scientists and medical professionals. Frank de Vocht, a professor of epidemiology and public health at Bristol Medical School in England, is considered a leading expert on how EMF affects humans and told The Washington Post that the theory is ""nonsense.""

Still, the 49ers' injury issues over the past decade or so are robust enough to take nothing off the table. This season, San Francisco lost three of its best players -- defensive end Nick Bosa (torn ACL), linebacker Fred Warner (broken ankle) and Kittle (Achilles) -- to season-ending injuries. First-round pick Mykel Williams (torn ACL) also missed a big chunk of the season.

There also were lengthy absences for quarterback Brock Purdy (turf toe variant), receivers Ricky Pearsall (sprained knee and ankle) and Jauan Jennings (rib, shoulder and ankle) and linebacker Tatum Bethune (groin).

According to OverTheCap, the 49ers had 20 players on a reserve list this season, accounting for more than $95 million in adjusted annual value on their contracts, the highest amount in the league by nearly $20 million over second-place Arizona.

That comes on the heels of a 2024 season in which the Niners led the league in adjusted games lost (141.2), a number that estimates the impact of injuries on teams. They also led the league in that category in 2020 (not including COVID).

""We're always looking into trends, data, everything we do,"" Lynch said. ""Our health and performance of our players is at the utmost priority each and every year. This year it was tough and it took a toll on our team and we'll continue to look. ... We've spent a lot of time and effort in recruiting really quality people. And I think being at the forefront of injury prevention and I think this year, probably because the star players that went down, there was a lot of attention given on that.""

On the injury front, Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan indicated that Bosa and Williams will have a chance to be back around the start of training camp or early into it. Warner should be good to go for the start of the offseason program, and Kittle is expected back during the season.

Rookie linebacker Nick Martin cleared concussion protocol Wednesday morning for a concussion he suffered Nov. 30, and tight end Jake Tonges suffered a plantar fascia injury against Seattle that will keep him out about three weeks.

Defensive tackle Alfred Collins might also need surgery on a shoulder injury suffered last week against Seattle, Shanahan said.

According to Lynch, the 49ers will do a deep dive into their entire process for injuries beyond conspiracy theories.

""The fact of the matter is injuries are a part of this game,"" Lynch said. ""What we strive to do is never to eliminate injuries, but to mitigate injuries. And I think we have a lot of good processes. We'll challenge them all. And that process has begun. It never frankly stopped. But yes, we'll look at everything and we'll examine everything.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0121%2Fr1603813_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 19:01:40.652431

The New England Patriots are one of the NFL’s best teams once again. Mike Vrabel immediately brought the Patriots back to glory, leading them to an AFC Championship game in his first season as head coach. Now the Patriots are gearing up for their most important game in several years. The team received a mixed bag of injury updates before this weekend’s game against the Broncos.

Vrabel said that cornerback Carlton Davis III is expected back at practice on a limited basis, per ESPN’s Mike Reiss.

Davis suffered a concussion against the Texans during the Divisional Round. He played well in that game, logging four tackles and snagging two huge interceptions.

It is a good sign that Davis should practice at all on Wednesday. However, the NFL’s concussion protocol is a multi-step process. It is simply too early to tell whether he’ll be cleared to play on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Vrabel also said that veteran receiver Mack Hollins will not start practicing on Wednesday.

Hollins suffered an abdomen injury in late December and was placed on injured reserve. He has missed New England’s last four games.

The fact that Hollins has not yet return to practice suggests he may not play in the AFC Championship. Even if he ends up getting activated, it would be unlikely that he has a large role in the offense after practicing so little this week.

But getting Hollins back would be a big emotional boost for the team. Patriots receivers Stefon Diggs and Kayshon Boutte explained after the Divisional Round that they were inspired by Hollins’ eventual return.

“We said one more game before we get Mack back,” said Boutte, per Mark Daniels of MassLive on X, formerly Twitter.

Both players did just enough against Houston to keep New England’s offense humming. But the challenge will be quite different against Denver this weekend.

Many expected Mack Hollins to return to practice today, but Mike Vrabel announced that it will not be the case. Hollins has spent four weeks on the injured reserve and is eligible to return for Sunday’s game.

“That won’t happen today,” Vrabel said when asked if the Patriots would be activating Hollins.

The move could come later in the week. However, the fact that the Patriots are not opening his practice window casts doubt on his availability for Sunday. The Denver Broncos have a great defense, and having Hollins on the field will go a long way.

If Hollins’ practice window is opened on Thursday, he would have just three days to show he’s ready to return from injured reserve. He was placed on injured reserve with an abdominal injury after the Patriots game against the Baltimore Ravens.

Before his injury, he had played 68% of offensive snaps, which was the most among Patriots receivers at the time. He was third on the team in receiving yards and receptions before landing on injured reserve.

At 6-foot-4, 221 pounds, Hollin’s presence downfield and in the run game was a huge part of the Patriots’ offense. They do not have another receiver with his build and skillset. Kayshon Boutte and Stefon Diggs were , but will have to wait to see him return to practice.

“It would mean a lot,” Boutte said about getting Hollins back, per MassLive’s Mark Daniels on Monday. “Even before this game, that was the message to our receivers. Me and Diggs come out before the game and talk together when we come out of the tunnel for warmups and said, ‘One more game, and we get Mack back.’ I think it would mean a lot to Mack. We bust our (expletive) to get where we are today, the AFC Championship.”

One of the challenges for their defense entering next season will be improving their pass rush.

And for their defensive ends to be healthy.

One of the leaders of that group, defensive end Greg Rousseau, spoke to the media during the locker cleanout on Sunday and revealed something previously unknown.

The edge professed that he was injured during the first game of the season and played through it.

I started the season off, I kind of hurt my knee versus Baltimore,” Rousseau said when asked about his individual play and how it ramped up near the end of the year.

“But then when I got healthier towards the middle end of the season, I feel like I started playing some real good ball, especially heading into the playoffs, getting to the quarterback, hitting the quarterback. Just trying to help the team win. I feel like I try my best, and obviously, there's always room to grow. So I'll be excited for the opportunity next year to keep on getting better and keep on helping the team win.”

The 2021 first-round pick out of Miami had more recently been practicing in a limited capacity throughout the week, going into the Bills' Division Round playoff matchup with the Denver Broncos. This after a strong outing in Buffalo's Wild Card round win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, finishing with six total tackles, 1 sack, and one pass defensed over 44 defensive snaps.

He started opposite veteran Joey Bosa this season, forming a formidable duo until Bosa's play plateaued late in the season after missing time with a hamstring injury himself in Week 14.

""It's tough. It's part of the game,"" he added. ""You could put together a roster at the beginning of the season, and then like fast forward 20 weeks, it's not the same. There are a lot of injuries, a lot of things happen in football. It's a violent game.""

It's unknown yet if Bosa will resign with the Bills this offseason, but Rousseau acknowledged that their teammates stepped up do their part to help the team compete.

""A lot of dudes stepped up. A lot of dudes really embraced it, and nobody was scared of the moment. Everybody stepped up to the plate and tried their best.""","https://billswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/12/SNET/88138921007-usatsi-27984984.jpg?crop=3926,2209,x0,y204&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 17:03:38.166960

The Texans are unable to make a decision on his future until medical personnel gather more information.
Come late November, the Texans effectively closed the door on Mixon suiting up at any point in 2025.
""It was a very unique situation,"" Caseiro said.
A stellar debut season in Houston set Mixon up for what most believed would be a highly productive 2025 campaign.","It remains unclear when, or even if, Houston Texans running back Joe Mixon can return to action after he missed the entire 2025 season with a foot injury. General manager Nick Caseiro said Wednesday that Mixon has not been at the team facility in some time. The Texans are unable to make a decision on his future until medical personnel gather more information.

Mixon missed OTAs and minicamp with what was believed to be an ankle injury. He was then feared to miss an extended period of time when the Texans placed him on the non-football injury list on July 23. His transfer to the reserve NFI list ruled him out for the first four games of the season, and Caseiro said after that period that while Mixon was progressing, he still needed at least another month before making a decision on his availability.

Come late November, the Texans effectively closed the door on Mixon suiting up at any point in 2025.

""It was a very unique situation,"" Caseiro said. ""I don't think anybody really had any clarity, honestly, from the start of the year until now. I'd say Joe worked very, very hard to try to get himself ready to play football. It just never manifested itself and came to fruition.

""Probably have an opportunity to kind of see where he is in the offseason relative to next year. But, again, it was as unique a situation and injury as I've been associated with. I don't want to call it a freak thing, but it's just kind of a freak thing. Joe worked really hard, put his best foot forward, but it didn't work out.""

The Texans have been coy about Mixon's status from the jump, which Caseiro chalked up to there being a lack of clarity regarding the injury itself. Houston's GM did shed more light on the situation this week, though, referring to the issue as a medical condition.

""He didn't do anything off the field,"" Caseiro said. ""It wasn't like he was riding a snowmobile or anything like that. I'd say it was just more of a medical condition or situation that really didn't improve maybe as much as everybody would have hoped. I'm not trying to evade the question. I think that's the reality of the situation. He didn't jump off a building. He wasn't cliff diving or anything like that.

""He wasn't doing anything irresponsible. It was a freak thing. Honestly, I've never seen it, the condition.""

A stellar debut season in Houston set Mixon up for what most believed would be a highly productive 2025 campaign. He earned his second career Pro Bowl nod in 2024 after rushing for 1,016 yards and 11 touchdowns and shining in a pair of playoff games. Instead, the Texans leaned on Woody Marks and Nick Chubb, who combined for just five rushing scores.

While eligible to return to practice this week, the free agency pickup has not yet been cleared to return to action.","Standing in front of a newly-branded backdrop reflecting his team’s spot in the AFC Championship Game, New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel met with the media on Wednesday to speak about the upcoming matchup with Denver Broncos. Among the topics discussed were injury updates on two starters, cornerback Carlton Davis and wide receiver Mack Hollins.

According to Vrabel, only one of the two will be present at the first practice of the week.

After catching a pair of interceptions in the first half of the Patriots’ divisional round game against the Houston Texans, Davis exited in the fourth quarter with what was later announced as a head injury. Originally deemed questionable to return, he was eventually ruled out before the two-minute warning.

According to Vrabel, Davis has since been placed in the NFL’s concussion protocol. Nonetheless, the belief is that he will be able to practice on Wednesday.

“I would anticipate him being out there, probably in a limited capacity,” said Vrabel. “But just working his way through protocol.”

Davis is one of the Patriots’ starting cornerbacks, lining up on the perimeter opposite Pro Bowler Christian Gonzalez. Ranked second on the team in defensive snaps this season, he was replaced by backup Charles Woods after his departure.

One of the Patriots’ starting receivers, Hollins caught 46 passes for 550 yards and a pair of touchdowns over the Patriots’ first 15 games of the regular season. However, and an abdomen injury forced the team to place him on injured reserve on Dec. 27, ahead of New England’s Week 17 contest against the New York Jets.

While eligible to return to practice this week, the free agency pickup has not yet been cleared to return to action.

“That won’t happen today, no,” said Vrabel.

Without Hollins, the Patriots gave increased opportunities to rookie receivers Kyle Williams and Efton Chism. The two youngsters finished last week’s game against the Texans ranked third and fourth among their position group in snaps, although neither was able to haul in a pass.

Hollins’ next opportunities to return to practice will come on Thursday and Friday; the Patriots will then travel to Denver on Saturday, at which point a decision about his return to the 53-man roster will have to be made.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2257293162.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=3.0595520019531%2C3.3498935183544%2C96.940447998047%2C76.137139785078&w=1200,N,,2026-01-21 16:01:11.511982

As with the previous piece, this isn’t only a “dang, that stinks” reaction. It’s a way to examine unexpected results to learn and improve. Interestingly, and not all too surprisingly, a lot of the receiving hits and misses hinged on the performances of their quarterbacks.

Wide receivers

Underperformers

Brian Thomas, JAX: To be fair to Thomas, starting the season with a wrist injury disappointed managers from the beginning. Many — including me — expected at least the same, if not better, success with Trevor Lawrence (vs. Mac Jones). Unfortunately, Thomas’ talent couldn’t bridge the rapport gap, and 2025 was worse. When Thomas was 100%, we saw flashes of his rookie season and upside, but never the consistent dominance — partially due to Lawrence’s comfort level throwing to his slot options.

He’s targeted the slot at a 32.5% rate since entering the NFL — ninth among 70 QBs with at least 250 attempts and fourth among full-time starters during that span (behind Lamar Jackson, Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes). Thomas dropped from a 26.9 Slot% mark to 21.4 this season, with first Travis Hunter, then Parker Washington, being the ones lining up in the slot the most. We saw how good Washington was at the end of the year, further proof of Lawrence’s comfort with those quick-decision throws to the slot.

Additionally, the arrival of Jakobi Meyers had Thomas being used as the downfield option all too often. Thomas saw a small jump from 11.6 AirYD/TGT to 12.9 this year, but once Meyers arrived, it rocketed to 17.6. That also came with just 5.2 targets per game, down from 7.8 last year.

The first part of the equation is actionable in terms of effectiveness with a different quarterback … but we knew that. A better quarterback doesn’t always mean a stock boost for everyone. The second part is deeper: Having this information on Lawrence’s slot reliance should have made managers abandon ship, even trading Thomas for a major discount on draft cost, once the Meyers trade happened, since there was no way it could get better.

Xavier Worthy, KC: Easily one of my biggest misses, as Worthy didn’t provide WR2 value, but couldn’t before even Rashee Rice’s return. Even factoring in the Week 1 injury, Worthy had just 14.6, 8.1 and 9.6 points, respectively, in Weeks 4-6, and zero double-digit games after his 14.6 showing, including just a 5.7 FPPG mark after Rice’s return — 57th among qualified WRs.

Sure, Patrick Mahomes missed the final three weeks, but Worthy was already on Bust Boulevard before that. Simply put, projecting Worthy to continue most of his late-2024 success was wrong. It’s not that we were purely chasing those final three games of last season, as Worthy had five double-digit scores before that and three more over 7.0 points.

The reason for the miss? Similar to Thomas, Worthy’s usage changed. He saw more downfield targets, which are inherently less reliable. Worthy went from a 75.0 Catchable TGT% as a rookie to 66.7%, with a deeper AirYD/TGT mark (12.9, up from 9.2). If the Catchable% doesn’t sound like a major drop, it is, as Worthy was 155th of 170 players with at least 25 routes and targets.

My assumption (and miss) was that Mahomes was too good for Worthy to fail in replacing the aging Travis Kelce as the No. 2 target earner. The targets were there — when healthy — but Worthy didn’t succeed as much downfield, which fell on Mahomes’ shoulders a bit too. Worthy replicating much of what Rice does — but not as well — was the fact not to overlook.

Justin Jefferson, MIN: Speaking of which, how about we don’t overlook just how much of a risk a quarterback can be? Even as someone who tabbed J.J. McCarthy as “J.J. McHeinicke,” I figured Jefferson was way, waayyy, too good to allow subpar QB play to stop him. After all, Jefferson could have retained his WR1 (Top 12) value with Taylor Heinicke under center, as he did with Nick Mullens and “Fugitive” villain (The One-Armed Man) Carson Wentz. It wasn’t only the decrease in targets, as Jefferson averaged 7.6 with McCarthy versus 9.9 the previous four seasons, but also how poor the targets were.

Nearly 20% (19.7) of McCarthy’s throws were off target, leading to a 52.6 Catch% for Jefferson, plus just 1.07 fantasy points per target (FPPT), well below his 1.71 career mark. I also jokingly called Jefferson “QB immune” due to his talent, but he wasn’t: He finished as WR34 in FPPG (min. 10 games) at 9.4. No one would have predicted it to be this bad, but ranking Jefferson as a WR1, let alone pushing the Top 5, did not account for the very real and very terrible QB-influenced floor.

Overperformers

George Pickens, DAL: Many of us expected the same, if not a better, Pickens as the Cowboys’ No. 2 receiving option versus being the top (only?) option with the Steelers in 2024. It turned out to be much better in Dallas. Pickens hit career highs across the board, finishing as WR6 with 14.3 FPPG and WR5 overall. It wasn’t only because CeeDee Lamb missed time either, as Pickens had a near-identical TmTGT% with (22.4) and without (22.8) Lamb on the field. You can toss in YD/REC (15.3 to 15.6), First Down per TGT% (54.4 to 51.1) and red zone target rate (0.71 to 0.53) as numbers that also barely changed. The miss in projections came down to lower REC% and YD/REC, as Dak Prescott’s numbers were actually super close (403-for-607, 4,460 yards, and 31.5 passing touchdowns, compared to 404-for-600, 4,552 and 30). I undersold Pickens’ per-play/target upside, so instead of increasing the volume with a small efficiency downtick, I should have had all of his per-target numbers pointing up … or at least holding steady.

Chris Olave, NO: A midseason QB change and trade of Rashid Shaheed were catalysts for Olave’s career-best campaign. Tyler Shough didn’t make a positive difference because of volume or OnTGT%, as both were better with Spencer Rattler (28.9 TGT% to 25.1 and 7.0 OffTGT% to 16.5). It was AirYD/TGT (9.7 to 13.5) and touchdowns (3 to 6). Shough, having more downfield ability, helped Olave climb from a volume middleman option (like Jarvis Landry of old) to a true all-around threat and Top 10 WR.

The lesson gleaned from Olave’s best season cannot be applied on draft day; rather, it applies in-season. Like when Meyers went to Jacksonville, and Jameson Williams benefited from Dan Campbell taking back offensive playcalling, buying low on Olave (as I suggested and many sent thanks for), given the upside with the change at QB and the addition of Shaheed, was the winning move.

Alec Pierce, IND: Similar to Jefferson in a different direction, no one saw Pierce’s ascendance coming, even if you predicted injury issues with the Colts’ wideouts. Pierce was all about the quarterback situation, which is a major theme here. With Anthony Richardson, Pierce saw 14.6 TGT% with a 44.4 REC% and 1.37 YPRR. With Daniel Jones, Pierce had 19.0%, 56.5% and 2.19, respectively. Those numbers dropped back with Philip Rivers’ ancient arm to 10.5%, 50.0% and 1.07, then rebounded with Riley Leonard to 22.6%, 58.3% and 3.51.

Pierce, like many of the “miss” wide receivers, has a style heavily influenced by his quarterback’s tendencies, abilities and rapport. Remember that not only for Pierce and where he plays next season, but also for any waiver grabs, given the upside or risk factors, if the backup quarterback is significantly different.

Tight ends

Underperformers

Mark Andrews, BAL: If you recall my Travis Etienne breakdown in the RB piece, one of the takeaways was not overrating half of a season. We should factor it in, particularly if it’s injury- or situational-related, but sometimes it’s just a minor factor. Once Andrews “woke up” in 2024, he was TE5 overall and in FPPG with a league-leading 11 touchdowns. Andrews’ targets and yards weren’t too far off from his norm, but the touchdown rate was astronomical. Even including a projected decrease for the 2025 season, Andrews was still pegged for nearly 8 touchdowns.

Due to his decline and quarterback play, Andrews was a major miss. I don’t like injury-related “misses” in general, and the negative impact on Lamar Jackson’s health played a part, but touchdown variance for receiving options can turn a stud into a bust rather easily.

Overperformers

Kyle Pitts, ATL: I didn’t project Pitts for the five touchdowns that kept his career progression on track — 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 from 2021-25 — and I also didn’t project him for enough overall production, even though I was one of the few willing to give him another chance. My line of 100 targets, 63 receptions and 745 yards fell short of his actual 118-88-928 line.

It wasn’t so much QB play with Pitts as it was the Falcons finally using him to his full ability. Instead of asking Pitts to run downfield regularly or work on his routes, they let Pitts use his body, as an NFL power forward of sorts, and man-up defenders to create space and make catches. While we don’t often like to see an AirYD/TGT number go from 10-14 yards to 7.4, there is a similarity to Worthy in that the usage better suited the player.

If you enjoy watching games and players this closely, you likely saw the same and didn’t need me to tell you that the Falcons finally stopped trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. If you’re a more casual fan — and I say that with no disrespect at all — you come to us, including the beat writers and scouts.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/20211257/USATSI_27884638-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-21 18:02:01.698262

New England head coach Mike Vrabel announced that cornerback Carlton Davis III was expected to practice in a limited capacity on Wednesday.

Davis, who was ruled out with a head injury late in Sunday’s divisional round victory over the Houston Texans, is progressing well enough to where he could be eligible to play against the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship.

The NFL’s concussion protocol makes sure that each game is staffed with three unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants, who are primarily responsible for identifying potential head injuries and removing players who exhibit signs of trauma from the game — entering them into the return-to-participation protocol.

Savis is currently in phase four of that protocol, meaning his neurological testing returned to baseline and he is eligible to return to non-contact football activities. If all goes right on Wednesday, he could elevate to phase five and be removed from protocol as early as Friday.

Christian Gonzalez went through a similar process last week, as he was removed from the wild-card victory over the Los Angeles Chargers with a head injury before returning as a limited participant in practice the following Wednesday. Gonzalez would go on to be listed as a full participant on Thursday and Friday, before making the start against Houston.

Mixon, 29, is a former second-round pick of the Bengals back in 2017. He was entering the final year of his four-year, $5.45-million rookie contract when Cincinnati re-signed him to a four-year, $48 million extension heading into the 2019 season.

Hollins was placed on the NFL’s injured reserve list on Dec. 27, meaning this is the first week he was active to return to practice and to the Patriots’ active roster. Hollins was a productive member of the team’s receiving corps before his injury, tallying 46 catches – the third-highest mark on the team before his injury – with 550 receiving yards. He also led all Patriots with 657 snaps when he was healthy.

Despite missing two games to end the season, Hollins still finished with the third-most receptions and fourth-most receiving yards — his 550 passing yards were one shy of tying Kayshon Boutte, who also dealt with injury issues late in the season, for third most on the team — in 2025.

The Texans were rocked just over a month before the start of the season when it was announced that Mixon, 29, had sustained a foot injury.

No other details were divulged at the time other than that the Pro Bowler would miss 'an extended period of time'.

Ultimately, Mixon didn't suit up at all throughout Houston's season, which ended with a playoff defeat to the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round last weekend.

Now, it appears that his future is shrouded in just as much mystery.

Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans had no further update on Mixon's condition when asked if he will play next season.

'I don't know the answer to that right now,' Ryans told reporters on Monday. 'No clarity.'

Ryans also refused to shed any further light on the injury that kept the running back on the non-football injury list throughout 2025.

'He didn't jump off a building,' the coach said. 'He wasn't doing anything irresponsible. It was a freak thing.'

The Texans signed four-time Pro Bowl running back Nick Chubb in free agency in June with the team leaning on him and rookie Woody Marks in Mixon's absence.

'When you have your best players, you're going to be a better team,' Ryans said. 'Joe, he's a really great running back for us and not having him, yes, of course, it affected our running game. Joe is one of the top running backs in this league. That affected us.'

Mixon has one year remaining on his two-year, $19.7 million contract with the Texans, leaving his NFL future in limbo.

“We haven’t seen Joe in a little bit, so I think at some point we’ll see him and then we’ll be able to evaluate kind of where he is and then based on information, we’ll see where his status is,” Caserio said.

The Texans provided few details on the 29-year-old Mixon’s recovery throughout the season after announcing in training camp that he sustained a foot injury away from the facility in the offseason.

Asked for details about his injury Wednesday, Caserio gave a bit more information but still didn’t specify exactly what the injury was.

“It wasn’t like he was riding a snowmobile or anything like that,” Caserio said. “It was more of a medical condition or situation that never… really didn’t improve maybe as much as everybody would have hoped. I’m not trying to evade the question, that’s the reality of the situation. He didn’t jump off a building. He wasn’t cliff diving or anything. He wasn’t doing anything irresponsible. It was just a freak thing.”

The Texans reached the divisional round of the playoffs for a third straight season, but their offense took a major hit with Mixon out all season with the injury. It came after he ran for 1,016 yards and 11 touchdowns in his first season with the team in 2024. He has one year remaining on a three-year, $27 million contract extension he signed after joining the Texans following seven years with the Bengals.

Caserio said they weren’t sure of his status throughout the season but held out hope that he could return at some point.

“It was a very unique situation,” he said. “I don’t think anybody really had any clarity, honestly, from the start of the year until now. I’d say Joe worked very, very hard to try to get himself ready to play football, it just never manifested itself, came to fruition. So probably have an opportunity to kind of see where he is in the offseason relative to next year.”

With Mixon out this season, the Texans relied on rookie Woody Marks and Nick Chubb. Marks, a fourth-round pick, led the team with 703 yards rushing and Chubb added 506 yards. The Texans struggled to run the ball in their loss to New England last week, managing just 48 yards rushing.

When asked specifically if they believe Mixon’s condition will improve enough for him to be ready for the start of training camp, Caserio said it’s too soon to tell.

“We’ll see. Believe me, I’m not smart enough to be a doctor so I’m going to leave that up to the medical experts,” he said. “Once we… get a little bit more clarity, more information, we’ll kind of see where we are.”

After the 2016 season, Golden State added Kevin Durant and he helped them add two more titles to the trophy case.","Mike Dunleavy wore a somber look of resignation as he spoke to the press before the Golden State Warriors hosted the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday night. Less than 24 hours earlier, Jimmy Butler had torn his ACL, effectively ending any last measure of hope for this Warriors season. Dressed in a dapper gray suit jacket and black slacks, the Golden State general manager looked the part of a man readying for a state funeral. Seconds after taking his seat, he began to speak for an organization in peril.

“I don’t have a positive twist on the news,” Dunleavy said. “It’s not good. But this will all come out well in the end and we’ll move forward.”

The situation quickly devolved from bad to worse, as the Raptors routed the Warriors, 145-127. Without the threat of a secondary scoring option, Toronto was able to blitz Stephen Curry, often relegating him to the wing as it built a 30-point lead in the third quarter. The performance laid bare the Warriors’ grim reality as they stare down the February trade deadline, the remainder of the season, and the final years of Curry’s career.

Last February, on the eve of the trade deadline, Dunleavy engineered a trade for and signed him to a two-year extension, hoping to breathe new life into Curry’s career twilight. It worked. Butler meshed immediately with Curry and Draymond Green, and the Warriors went 23-7 with Butler in the lineup down the stretch. They finished seventh in the Western Conference, advanced through the play-in and past the 2-seed Houston Rockets in the first round, and eventually lost in the second round of the playoffs—a series Curry missed after suffering a hamstring strain in Game 1.

This season started slow and uneven, but over the past month, Butler and the Warriors were playing their finest basketball of the year. Prior to Tuesday night’s game, Golden State had won 12 of 16 games, climbing to the 8-seed in the West. Butler was in the midst of a typically excellent season, averaging 20 points, six rebounds, and five assists on lights-out efficiency. All of it came to a halt in the third quarter of Monday’s win over Miami, when Butler’s knee buckled on landing after he jumped to catch a pass.

Butler’s injury is at once clarifying and confounding for the Warriors. Any hopes that Dunleavy and the front office harbored about making noise in the playoffs are dashed. Even a splashy trade deadline acquisition wouldn’t do enough to elevate a team that relies on Butler’s defense and secondary playmaking. Bigger picture, Golden State now finds itself in a hole so deep—with an old roster, a series of misses in the draft, and now a devastating injury—that it may be impossible to dig out of.

When Joe Lacob and Peter Gruber purchased the team in 2010, Lacob aimed to re-create the Celtics dynasties he watched as a child in New England. He installed luminaries like Jerry West and Rick Welts into leadership roles, and hired a young Bob Myers. Those decisions paid off, as Myers rounded out the roster around Curry and Klay Thompson by drafting Draymond Green and acquiring complementary veterans like Andre Iguodala, Leandro Barbosa, and Shaun Livingston. The Warriors won the title in 2015. After the 2016 season, Golden State added Kevin Durant and he helped them add two more titles to the trophy case.

In recent years, Lacob’s grip on basketball decisions has clouded Golden State’s future around Curry. In 2020, he grew enamored of James Wiseman after a predraft workout, pushing the team to draft the 6-foot-11 center instead of flipping the no. 2 pick for an established player. The following year, he pushed his front office to draft Jonathan Kuminga over Trey Murphy III, whom many on the staff pushed for, seeing the 18-year-old as a potential star who could both help Curry in the short term and then fill the seats of Chase Center long after Curry was gone.

Now in his fifth season, Kuminga’s career has been defined by tension with the coaching staff and an inability to hold down a role within the Warriors’ system. And despite the star power Golden State still possesses, its season has been defined by Kuminga’s discontent. Over the summer, the team and Kuminga’s representatives engaged in an intense negotiation before reaching a two-year pact during training camp. But that détente was short-lived. Another clash with Steve Kerr left Kuminga on the bench for 16 straight games entering Tuesday evening. And last week, Kuminga officially demanded a trade.

The Warriors have been trying to offload Kuminga’s contract since last summer, to no avail. “When you make a demand,” Dunleavy said on Tuesday, “there needs to be a demand on the market. So we’ll see where that unfolds.”

In Butler’s absence against the Raptors, Kuminga did his best to fill the void and audition for the rest of the league, scoring 20 points in 21 minutes, including a buzzer-beater to end the third quarter, prompting a Lacob fist pump. The performance, which happened mostly during garbage time, helped Golden State whittle Toronto’s lead to 11 before the Raptors rebounded to hold on to the win and snap a two-game skid.

Following the defeat, Kerr remained positive. “We’re well equipped with our depth to continue to play at a high level,” he said, citing the offseason signings of guard De’Anthony Melton and veteran big Al Horford, who didn’t play Tuesday evening to preserve his 39-year-old body, as reasons to be hopeful. “I think we have enough to compete,” Kerr added.

But Kerr’s future is still up in the air. This is the final year of his contract, and as of Wednesday, he has yet to sign a new deal. Though Kerr has publicly been mum about his future, multiple assistant coaches have been operating under the premise that he will not return next season, according to team sources, with some surveying the league to secure jobs next season. Last month, longtime assistant Chris DeMarco left the staff to be the head coach of WNBA’s New York Liberty.

Butler’s future is also up in the air. Last spring, he entered a marriage of convenience with Golden State, which offered him a two-year extension that lined his contract length up with The injury marks a devastating turn for one of the game’s great players and one of its most compelling personalities. Butler will turn 37 in September; the team has yet to offer a timetable for his return, but his recovery could keep him out for part of next season, as well.

The Warriors will have more options over the summer than they will between now and the trade deadline next month. Still, on Tuesday evening, Dunleavy seemed open to any possibility, including parting with draft picks to salvage another shot at contention with Curry. At 25-20, the Warriors sit eighth in the West, 2.5 games out of the 6-seed and five games over the Clippers in 10th.

Time is ticking. Curry will turn 38 in March. He’s still capable of greatness, but his team has no road map back to the league’s mountaintop.

It’s been a long time coming, but it’s still striking to see the Warriors like this. Butler’s injury feels like yet another body blow to a dynasty that rose to power with a joyful, unbridled swagger. Even during lean times, the Warriors projected optimism about the future. But late Tuesday night, as they prepped for a four-game winter road trip, the cold reality of NBA purgatory set in.

“We’ve got to get through it,” Green said. “Injuries happen and that’s why you got 15 guys on a roster. Somebody else or collectively got to step up. But I believe we can figure it out. What does that mean for us long term? I don’t know.

“If I had all the answers right now, I would gladly give them to you. But I just don’t.”",https://wp.theringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cropped-nextforwarriors_getty_ringer-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 16:01:51.618643

I’m not trying to evade the question, that’s the reality of the situation. He didn’t jump off a building. He wasn’t cliff diving or anything. He wasn’t doing anything irresponsible. It was just a freak thing.”

The Texans reached the divisional round of the playoffs for a third straight season, but their offense took a major hit with Mixon out all season with the injury. It came after he ran for 1,016 yards and 11 touchdowns in his first season with the team in 2024. He has one year remaining on a three-year, $27 million contract extension he signed after joining the Texans following seven years with the Bengals.

Caserio said they weren’t sure of his status throughout the season but held out hope that he could return at some point.

As he sat in front of the podium late Monday night, trying to process what Jimmy Butler’s knee injury meant to the Golden State Warriors — and himself — Curry paused, deciding he wasn’t ready to answer the question asked of him.

“I won’t talk about him being out until we know what’s going on,” Curry said.

But everyone in Chase Center already knew when Butler fell awkwardly on his right knee. An MRI later confirmed it: Butler had a season-ending ACL injury. He was done for the year.

Butler’s injury also officially closed the Warriors’ final hope of making one last title push in the Curry era. The Warriors were built, after a trade just before last season’s deadline, around two future Hall of Famers, Curry and Butler, with no runway beyond the present. Curry will turn 38 on March 14. Butler will be 37 in September. The window, in theory, was open through the end of 2026-27. Well, it closed Monday night.

No team can afford a season-ending injury to a star player. But Butler’s injury feels different. This iteration of the Warriors, with Curry at the forefront and Butler serving as an essential wingman, was built for now.

Warriors owner Joe Lacob and GM Mike Dunleavy have to acknowledge that.

Best-case scenario, Butler returns about a year from now after months of rehab. Despite dealing with numerous injuries over his career, it would be unreasonable to expect him to return at the same level. Draymond Green, who turns 36 in March, has already shown signs of regression. Without meaningful games to play, sustaining his standard high level of play becomes harder.

Curry and Green won’t leave quietly. Their pride and legacy — the one they created alongside former Warriors great Klay Thompson — means a lot to them.

The hope that followed Butler’s arrival last February and a late-season surge during which the Warriors won 12 of their last 16 games is gone. The idea that they’d be able to win another championship, as far-fetched as it seemed even before Butler got hurt, has also vanished. Expecting Curry to carry another flawed team for another season at this level, despite his greatness, is unrealistic.

Financially, the Warriors are stuck. Butler is making over $54 million this season and nearly $57 million next season while rehabbing. There is no player out there that the Warriors could acquire via trade that replaces what Butler provided next to Curry. The Warriors’ fan base, which was clamoring for a trade long before Butler’s injury, has to accept that there’s only so much Lacob and Dunleavy can do.

Some Warriors fans are still holding onto the dream of landing Giannis Antetokounmpo in a deal. As The Athletic’s Danny Leroux noted, Butler and Antetokounmpo have essentially the same cap slot in a max deal, making a swap theoretically easier during the summer when Golden State would no longer be hard-capped and able to take on more salary. If they were to wait until after the draft, the Warriors would be able to offer a wider variety of picks, including both their 2026 and 2027 selections, without being impacted by the Stepien rule.

But unless Antetokounmpo forces his way to the Bay, the Bucks would certainly receive better offers than a package built around Butler’s expiring deal and future picks/young assets. That also assumes Antetokounmpo would even ask out of Milwaukee, something he repeatedly has said he would never do. Also, it’s fair to wonder if a Warriors’ future centered around Curry, Antetokounmpo and very few future picks is much better than the one that’s staring them in the face now.

Dunleavy is stuck in no man’s land as far as any next moves go. The Warriors are hard-capped at the second apron, aging and no longer a contender. Could they package Butler’s expiring deal with other players and picks for another player? Sure, but he wouldn’t fit better than Butler.

Frankly, the more pressing short-term question for Dunleavy should be whether he should move some players to set up next season.

Lacob is competitive and badly wants to win. After Curry broke his hand in the fourth game of the 2019-20 season and missed four months, Lacob scoffed at the idea that the Warriors would tank — even though Curry’s injury, Thompson’s ACL ailment and a general lack of talent put the Warriors at 15-50 and led them to the No. 2 pick in 2020 NBA Draft, which turned out to be James Wiseman.

Over the past month, this group started to find a rhythm, at least, in part due to Butler’s renewed offensive presence and foul-drawing ability, which helped take the pressure off Curry. Without him, the Warriors would be better served to see what they can get on the market for some of their veterans.

De’Anthony Melton, who missed almost all of last season while rehabbing his own ACL injury, has really turned a corner in recent weeks. At 27, and with a player option next season that he seems likely to decline, the Warriors risk letting him walk for nothing. Wouldn’t it make more sense to get an asset in return?

Al Horford came to the Warriors believing he would have a better chance to win a championship this season than he would with the Boston Celtics. The 39-year-old has really struggled this season due to injuries and inconsistency, but his veteran presence still holds value to a contender. The Warriors are no longer one.

Jonathan Kuminga’s status remains in flux, his present clouded by speculation about his future. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after Monday’s game that he was open to using Kuminga in Butler’s absence, but it’s unclear, even after Kuminga returned to the rotation Tuesday, if either side still wants a professional partnership.

All of those factors point back to the question that Curry wasn’t ready to answer out loud. Without Butler in the fold, any hope for the foreseeable future is gone. Even with Butler, the Warriors were mediocre, trying to stay afloat. Or as Kerr put it last month, “We are a fading dynasty. We know that. Everybody knows that.”

Now, the fading is over.
