The 2025 NFL regular season is almost over, with just five weeks before the playoffs. As the postseason draws nearer, injuries become all the more important for contending teams. Suffering a major injury so close to the playoffs can end a player’s season for good. And even a minor injury could still have them hobbled early in January.

This week’s injury lineup features several important players to contending teams, headlined by Chargers QB Justin Herbert.

Let’s explore some of the most important injuries from Week 13 of the 2025 NFL season.

Colts CB Sauce Gardner (calf)

The Colts hoped that Sauce would immediately transform their defense. He has played well so far, but his latest injury could keep the superstar cornerback out for a little while.

Gardner is expected to miss a few weeks with his calf injury. Thankfully, he avoided the worst-case scenario (such as an Achilles injury) which could have easily been a season-ending injury.

It is great news that Gardner will be able to return during the regular season. However, the timing of his injury is still not ideal for the Colts.

Indianapolis is 8-4 but on a two-game losing streak. They are currently losing ground against the Jaguars (8-4) and Texans (7-5) in the AFC South.

The Colts play the Jaguars in Week 14, and doing so without Sauce is certainly not ideal.

Hopefully the Colts can keep their hopes of becoming division champs alive while Gardner gets healthy.

Chargers QB Justin Herbert (hand)

Herbert suffered a hand injury during LA’s big win against Las Vegas on Sunday.

The veteran quarterback fractured his left hand and is set to undergo surgery on Monday, according to head coach Jim Harbaugh.

At this point, the Chargers are uncertain if Herbert will miss any time. But it certainly seems possible considering it is a hand injury, even to his non-throwing hand.

Perhaps the Chargers will consider their standing in the AFC playoff race before deciding when to rush Herbert back.

Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle)

The superstar wide receiver suffered an ankle injury during the first quarter against the Packers on Thanksgiving.

St. Brown left the game and did not return, and Detroit felt his absence throughout the rest of the game on offense. Thankfully, his injury does not sound too severe.

NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported on Friday that St. Brown is believed to have suffered a low ankle sprain.

Detroit plays against Dallas on December 4th, but then has 10 days before their next game against Los Angeles.

The Lions will want St. Brown back on the field soon as they compete for a playoff spot in the NFC.

Vikings RB Aaron Jones (shoulder)

Jones started the game for the Vikings and played into the third quarter. But he suffered a shoulder injury and did not return to the game.

Vikings head coach Kevin O’Connell said Jones will need further evaluation to determine the extent of his injury.

If Jones misses time, Jordan Mason could absorb most of his carries.

Meanwhile, O’Connell added that starting center Ryan Kelly suffered a hip flexor injury against the Seahawks. Kelly already missed multiple games this season after suffering multiple concussions.

The Vikings are already 4-8, so it will be interesting to see if they start resting players for the remainder of the season.

Browns DT Maliek Collins (knee)

Collins was carted off the field after suffering a knee injury against the 49ers. He was quickly ruled out for the rest of the game.

The Browns announced on Monday that Collins suffered a season-ending quadriceps injury. He will undergo surgery and is bracing himself for a lengthy recovery.

Veteran Sam Kamara could see more work with Collins out for the season.

Steelers LB Patrick Queen (hip)

Queen suffered what appeared to be a hip injury against the Bills in Week 13. However, further testing determined that Queen’s hip is not the issue.

NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported on Monday that Queen is believed to have suffered a lower back bruise. He will undergo further testing to determine the severity of his injury.

The situation could change, but there is currently hope that this is not a long-term injury.

Hopefully Queen can return soon as the Steelers try to stay alive in the AFC playoff race.

Bills edge rusher Joey Bosa (hamstring)

Bosa suffered a hamstring injury during the fourth quarter against the Steelers. He left the game and did not return.

It is currently unclear if Bosa’s injury is significant, or if the Bills were simply trying to play it safe with their star pass rusher.

Bosa has remained surprisingly healthy during his short stint in Buffalo. The veteran edge rusher has an extensive injury history. He even gave Bills fans a scare during the summer when he missed OTAs because of a calf issue.

Bosa’s injury history alone make this a potentially concerning situation for the Bills.

Fans should keep an eye out for further updates and monitor how much Bosa practices, if at all, ahead of Week 14.

In the third quarter, Fannin experienced the flip side of being in the NFL.","The Browns continue their homestand in Week 14 when they host the Titans on Dec. 7 at Huntington Bank Field.

Cleveland's first of two consecutive home games was impacted by a fourth down fumble and a muffed punt that resulted in 13 49ers points in a 26-8 loss. The Browns aim to start the month of December in the win column against Tennessee.

""We did too many things that make it hard to beat a good team,"" head coach Kevin Stefanski said. ""It's not about one play. There's not one play that I'm talking about. But just in general, as a team, we have to play complementary football, and that'll be our focus. That's something that we're watching the tape right now, pointing it out in ways that we could better offensively, defensively, special teams.""

Here are the main pieces of news and storylines heading into Week 14's game against the Titans.

Kevin Stefanski gives injury updates

Stefanski provided updates on DT Maliek Collins, RB Dylan Sampson, T Jack Conklin and G Wyatt Teller.

Collins will miss the remainder of the season with a quad injury that will require surgery. He was in the middle of a career season when he went down during the third quarter against the 49ers in Week 13. He had set a new career-high for sacks in a season with 6.5 in Week 12 against the Raiders and was inching toward career-highs in quarterback hits and tackles for loss.

""Very disappointed for Maliek, and he's obviously been playing such good football, and he provides great leadership for this football team,"" Stefanski said. ""So disappointed for him, but he will bounce back.""

Sampson suffered a calf injury in the third quarter against San Francisco before being ruled out in the fourth quarter. Stefanski said Sampson is day to day heading into Week 14. Conklin is in the concussion protocol after being evaluated near the end of the second quarter.

Teller is considered week to week with a calf injury and will miss Week 14, Stefanski said. G Teven Jenkins will take over his duties at guard after rotating snaps at the position previously with Teller.

""I felt like it would help Wyatt (Teller) play better,"" Stefanski said about putting Jenkins and Teller on a rotation at guard. ""I think Teven's (Jenkins) deserving of some plays and I thought both guys played really well yesterday.""

Browns' defense faces Cam Ward

Cleveland's defense's first test without Collins will be against the Titans and the 2025 first overall pick QB Cam Ward. Tennessee is 1-11 this season and has not won a game since Week 5.

Opposing defenses have impacted Ward all over the field, as he has been sacked two or more times in all 12 games. He has thrown for 2,351 yards and seven touchdowns but has been intercepted six times. Ward has stayed interception-free since Week 8 but has fumbled the ball nine times, including four times in the last four weeks.

The Browns have generated takeaways as a defense, recording 15 this season. They are tied for 11th for most takeaways in the NFL with nine interceptions and six fumble recoveries. The key to beating Tennessee is for Cleveland to keep forcing turnovers, according to LB Devin Bush.

""We just have to put him in a situation to struggle some more if he wants some success,"" Bush said. ""So as much as we can do that, the better off we'll be.""

Harold Fannin Jr. experiences the highs and lows of the NFL

As TE Harold Fannin Jr. turned his head, he caught the ball and ran six yards before putting his head down at the 3-yard line to power his way into the end zone in the second quarter. The touchdown was Fannin's third of the season and put the Browns up 8-7 with a two-point conversion from RB Quinshon Judkins.

Fannin has had a productive rookie season as he leads Cleveland with 51 receptions for 505 receiving yards and has three receiving touchdowns – tied with TE David Njoku for the most receiving touchdowns on the Browns.

In the third quarter, Fannin experienced the flip side of being in the NFL. Fannin fumbled a direct snap on fourth-and-1 at the Browns' 33-yard line and failed to convert. The 49ers scored with the short field and took a 17-8 lead.

""I feel like all players go through (wanting a play back),"" Fannin said. ""There's going to be some highs, there's going to be some lows but just come to work, ready to work every day.""

Preparing for Week 12 and Week 13 included building chemistry with QB Shedeur Sanders as the starter. Fannin has been a top option for Sanders since the rookie signal-caller entered at the beginning of the second half against the Ravens in Week 11.

Sanders and Fannin have connected eight times for 108 yards in three weeks. Sanders' first pass to Fannin was for 25 yards to get to the Ravens' side of the field in Week 11. The pass between the two rookies came with 2:31 left in the game as Sanders attempted to lead a comeback in his first regular season action. The two have spent extra time together to talk through different scenarios in order to build their chemistry.

""Obviously the practices, but I feel like I was just sitting down talking in the locker room, seeing how he wants things and seeing how I see things,"" Fannin said. ""Trying to just meet in the middle, really.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/browns/r0qjkbdgsd9fb1te1wny,N,,2025-12-01 19:04:37.253123

NFL news is nonstop, and we're breaking it all down week by week this season.

Here's the latest on what's happening around the league entering Week 14:

Colts Sauce Gardner dealing with calf injury

Indianapolis Colts coach Shane Steichen said Monday that starting cornerback Sauce Gardner is expected to miss ""some time"" after injuring his left calf during Sunday's 20-16 loss to the Houston Texans but that Gardner avoided hurting his Achilles tendon.

Steichen didn't provide details on how much time the two-time All-Pro might miss but said he believed Gardner would return this season and that he's not expected to go on injured reserve.

Gardner was hurt on the Texans second offensive play of the game while in coverage, but he did not appear to get hit when he went down. He stayed on the field for several minutes before he was helped off the field and taken to the locker room.

The Colts envisioned pairing Gardner with two other Pro Bowl cornerbacks, Charvarius Ward and Kenny Moore II, to create one of the league's top secondaries when they acquired him in a trade deadline deal that included sending two first-round picks to the New York Jets.

So far, though, those plans haven't worked out. Gardner, Moore and Ward have only played one full game together.

Browns lose Collins for rest of season

Cleveland Browns defensive tackle Maliek Collins will be lost for the rest of the season after suffering a quad injury in Sunday's 26-8 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. Coach Kevin Stefanski made the announcement Monday that Collins will have to undergo season-ending surgery.

The 10-year veteran defensive lineman sustained the non-contact injury during the third quarter. He was second on the team with 6.5 sacks along with 28 quarterback pressures. Collins is also a key reason why All-Pro pass rusher Myles Garrett needs four sacks to break the NFL's single-season record of 22.5.

""When you lose a guy like Maliek, you don’t replace him. He’s made a big impact on this football team on the field and off. We have some older guys in there (the defensive line room), but we have a bunch of young guys in there. I think they’ve learned a lot from the professional that Maliek is and I think you have to carry that with you throughout.""

Collins' injury with 9:36 remaining in the third quarter also set off a fracas between some of the Browns defensive linemen and San Francisco wide receiver Jauan Jennings. Garrett and Shelby Harris said some of Jennings' comments after the play crossed the line.

Chargers QB Herbert to undergo surgery

Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert will have surgery Monday to repair a broken bone in his non-throwing hand.

Herbert is optimistic about his chances to play next week for the Chargers (8-4), who beat the Raiders 31-14 on Sunday for their fourth victory in five games. Herbert played the final three quarters against Las Vegas with a hard cast on his left hand while exclusively taking shotgun snaps.

""I think it's one of those things where you just stabilize it (and play),"" Herbert said. ""I'm not the doctor, unfortunately, but they were hopeful, so I think that's a good thing.'

Herbert wasn't sure when his hand was broken, but it appeared to happen late in the Chargers’ opening drive when he was thrown to the ground by Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn after a short scramble. Herbert threw a touchdown pass to Quentin Johnston on the next snap, but trainers took him off the field a few minutes later.

""I'm treating it as if I'm playing Monday,"" Herbert said of the surgery and recovery, and the Chargers' next matchup against the Eagles. ""I think they were very hopeful for that, so I think that's just something we'll see tomorrow and get a feel for.""

Herbert has 2,842 yards passing with 21 touchdowns and 10 interceptions this season, his sixth for the Chargers.

Vikings waive WR Thielen

The Minnesota Vikings waived wide receiver Adam Thielen on Monday, allowing the 13-year veteran an opportunity for more playing time elsewhere down the stretch of his expected final NFL season and ending a disappointing return to his original team.

Thielen had just eight catches for 69 yards for the Vikings (4-8) this year and was a healthy scratch for their game at Seattle on Sunday, a 26-0 loss that was their first shutout in 18 years. With the Vikings struggling badly on offense, Thielen was rarely used behind the top three wide receivers Justin Jefferson, Jordan Addison and Jalen Nailor.

Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah said Thielen's agent asked last week for his release so he could find a more significant role with another club. Thielen plans to retire after this season.

""Following discussions through the weekend and out of respect for Adam, we have agreed to give him the opportunity to pursue more playing time elsewhere. Adam is one of the all-time great Vikings, and we wish him and his family continued success,"" Adofo-Mensah said.

Despite the injury, Gardner appeared to be in relatively good spirits as he interacted with his coaches and teammates during Indy’s eventual 20-16 loss.","Indianapolis Colts star cornerback Sauce Gardner will miss “some time” due to a left calf injury, coach Shane Steichen said Monday.

Steichen declined to outline a specific timetable for Gardner’s return, but the coach did say the cornerback won’t be placed on injured reserve and that he expects Gardner to suit up again for the Colts this season. The cornerback’s absence will be a big loss for Indianapolis to overcome, but it’s still a relief for him and the team that further testing did not reveal an Achilles injury.

“It’s his calf,” Steichen said. “His Achilles is good to go.”

Gardner exited Sunday’s loss to the Houston Texans after playing just two snaps. He came up lame while being blocked by Texans tight end Cade Stover and needed to be helped off the field and back to the locker room.

“Felt like I got shot in the calf or something, but it was like high (in my calf),” Gardner said after the game. “I wasn’t fearing (an Achilles injury). I wasn’t thinking it.”

Gardner was quickly ruled out for the remainder of the game. He returned to the sideline while using crutches and wearing a boot on his lower left leg. Despite the injury, Gardner appeared to be in relatively good spirits as he interacted with his coaches and teammates during Indy’s eventual 20-16 loss.

The Colts acquired Gardner, 25, in a massive trade with the New York Jets on Nov. 4. Indianapolis shipped its next two first-round picks and wide receiver AD Mitchell to New York in exchange for Gardner, who was the 2022 No. 4 pick and Defensive Rookie of the Year. Gardner is also the only cornerback since the NFL merger in 1970 to have earned a first-team All-Pro selection in each of his first two seasons.

Gardner was supposed to give Indianapolis a boost amid its playoff push, but now it appears the Colts will have to make at least part of that push without him. The Colts were in first place in the AFC after defeating the Atlanta Falcons in Week 10, which was Gardner’s franchise debut, but that was their only victory in November. Indianapolis has now lost back-to-back games for the first time this season and three of its last four.

The Colts will likely turn to Jaylon Jones and Mekhi Blackmon while Gardner is out. Jones, a 2023 seventh-round pick, has started 28 games over the past three years. Blackmon, a 2023 third-round pick whom the Colts acquired in an August trade with the Minnesota Vikings, has started seven games this year.

“That’s the NFL. Guys are gonna get hurt. Guys are gonna get injured and miss time,” Steichen said. “… You gotta put the pieces together and scheme it up and put your guys in position to go be successful. Whoever’s out there, we got faith and trust in whoever steps into that role and how we use them.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/01123826/GettyImages-2249213729-scaled-e1764610734408.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-01 19:04:44.555493

Let’s dive in.

Week 14 Byes: Carolina Panthers, New England Patriots, New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers

NFL Week 14 Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers

Herbert will undergo surgery today to fix a metacarpal fracture in his non-throwing hand. That said, he is expected to be ready to play in week 14 against the Eagles.

J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings

Kevin O’Connell stated that McCarthy no longer has any concussion symptoms and should return if he has no setbacks and practices fully on Wednesday.

Sam Darnold, Seattle Seahawks

Darnold is dealing with an ankle injury. That said, it’s not expected to hamper him heavily, and he will likely be good to go this weekend.

NFL Week 14 Injury Report: Running Backs

Aaron Jones, Minnesota Vikings

Jones has been dealing with various issues this year and will have his recent shoulder injury evaluated further, per head coach Kevin O’Connell. This evaluation has shown that this is not a serious injury, and he’s currently day-to-day per Adam Schefter.

NFL Week 14 Injury Report: Wide Receivers

Marvin Harrison, Arizona Cardinals

Marv returned from his appendectomy only to miss time in the second half of the game due to a heel injury. Given that he was unable to return and the team has been removed from playoff contention, this may be used to shut MHJ down for the remainder of the season.

Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions

Head Coach Dan Campbell has stated that he doesn’t have a clear idea of whether ARSB will be available on Thursday against Dallas. He stated he is not expected to have any idea of his status until game day. This ankle injury could be a limiting factor for ARSB as the Lions fight for a playoff push, as they currently are not in the playoffs.

Drake London, Atlanta Falcons

London is now being considered “day-to-day” and has a chance to play this weekend, per head coach Raheem Morris. This would be a big addition back for this Falcons offense and for fantasy managers.

Tee Higgins, Cincinnati Bengals

Higgins is still in concussion protocol per Ben Baby of ESPN. His absence was noticed in Joe Burrow’s return, and the hope is that he can clear protocol and return to the lineup this weekend, though we have seen an increase in multi-week absences from concussions this year.

Jayden Reed, Green Bay Packers

Reed has yet to be medically cleared for game action. That said, head coach Matt LaFleur plans to see where he is at by the end of the week, signifying that he could return to action sooner than expected.

Parker Washington, Jacksonville Jaguars

Washington left this weekend's game against the Titans with a hip injury. He’s been a solid fill-in for managers, but they may be without him moving forward into the playoffs if he misses time.

Mike Evans, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Evans is expected to return to practice this week. This is huge news for the Buccs, and while he likely won’t be active this week, managers can hopefully get him back active after this weekend.

NFL Week 14 Injury Report: Tight Ends

Dalton Kincaid, Buffalo Bills

Kincaid has continued to remain inactive with his hamstring injury.

Cowboys’ initial injury report","The Detroit Lions (7-5) and Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1) have declared their initial Week 14 injury reports as they prepare to square off in an NFC showdown. With this game being played on a Thursday, the Lions’ practice schedule is altered this week. Their initial report comes out on Monday, while the injury declarations will be announced on Wednesday.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

Zylstra, who has been out most of the season with an ankle injury, has returned to practice. With the Lions’ tight end room currently without their top two options, Zylstra could bring a big boost to the room when fully healthy and ready to return.

Paschal appeared to be progressing through the injury evaluation window, but was downgraded and unable to practice midway through last week, indicating something unexpected likely happened. Unfortunately, his injury evaluation clock expired last Wednesday, and the Lions elected to leave him on the NFI list, thus ending his 2025 season. With Paschal being in a contract year, he’ll enter the offseason with his future in limbo.

“It just wasn’t enough time, really, to really be able to say that we knew he would be able to get through the year or that he was ready,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said on Sunday. “That’s what it came down to. Hate it for him, but it’s where it was at.”

No practice

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) — injured in Week 13

WR Kalif Raymond (ankle)

TE Brock Wright (neck)

CB Terrion Arnold (shoulder) — New injury

St. Brown’s injury is not expected to be long-term, and an MRI confirmed a low ankle sprain with no structural damage, but it could keep him out of this game and possibly the next. St. Brown will surely be pushing to play this week, but don’t expect the Lions to take any chances with one of their core players. If there’s any risk, they’ll likely hold him out.

Raymond’s availability is still a bit of a mystery as the Campbell did not provide an update ahead of this report, but hopefully, we’ll know more on Tuesday.

Wright’s neck injury was clarified a bit this week: Campbell called it a “trachea” injury, and Dave Birkett later reported that the tight end actually fractured cartilage in his throat, similarly to what Frank Ragnow did five years ago. Unfortunately, without new information, this could result in a long-term injury.

“Nothing new from last week,” Campbell stated. “We’re still sending out scans for this trachea and just seeing if there’s any other second opinions that would change the outlook for him playing. And right now, there’s really nothing, right now, that would change that. And I know that frustrates him; he wants to play. But we’re just kind of in a holding pattern right now.”

Arnold just cleared the NFL’s concussion protocol and returned to limited work in Week 13. He didn’t appear to suffer his shoulder injury in the game, but he was unable to practice on Monday, indicating it likely popped up afterward.

Limited practice

RB Sione Vaki (thumb)

TE Shane Zylstra (ankle, IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 20

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

C Graham Glasgow (knee) — Upgraded from no practice

S Brian Branch (toe/ankle)

S Kerby Joseph (knee) — Upgraded from no practice

Vaki continues to play through his most recent injuries, though his thumb injury is likely what’s keeping him from a special teams returner role. It’s worth noting that he is no longer listed with an ankle injury.

Decker has routinely alternated between participating in practices and taking time off to allow his body to heal. Nothing new to worry about here.

Glasgow’s doing “better,” Campbell said on Sunday, while also making sure to note that they’ve only done walkthroughs ahead of Monday’s practice. Nothing is certain at this stage of his rehabilitation, but a return to the field is a step in the right direction.

Branch has had lingering foot injuries for just over a month now, but he’s been able to play through them for the most part. It’s worth keeping an eye on things, but the concern level is very low.

Joseph has now missed six games as the Lions work toward getting “some stability in the leg.” But he’s been running and doing some individual work for a while now, and a return to practice on Monday is a big next step.

“I mean, he’s closer than he was before,” Campbell noted on Sunday. “He’s close. We’ll know a lot more, really, tomorrow (Monday). Today’s a walkthrough, so tomorrow (and Tuesday), see where he’s at. But he is getting better, like we said, he gets better every week.”

No longer on the injury report

RB Jacob Saylors (back/knee)

WR Isaac TeSlaa (hand)

RT Penei Sewell (ankle)

RG Tate Ratledge (knee)

G Miles Frazier (knee)

EDGE Marcus Davenport (shoulder)

Saylors has also played through his injuries and is contributing fully on special teams, but he’s now off the injury report. With Craig Reynolds off to the Patriots, Saylors and Vaki’s roles have increased.

TeSlaa has been banged up of late but has been able to play through an oblique and hand injury. With St. Brown and Raymond not practicing, the rookie should be in line for another starting role this week.

Sewell has been a regular on the injury report of late, but he’s managed to play through all of his injuries. Now that he’s off the injury report, the expectation is that he’ll start again this week without concern.

Ratledge has also been able to play through his injuries, as the rookie’s body has been able to bounce back quickly when dealing with an injury. With him clear of the injury report, things are looking up.

Frazier was activated from PUP last week, but was ruled inactive for the game. It’s not clear whether his ankle or inexperience kept him from participating, but he’s headed in the right direction.

Davenport was activated from IR last week and was immediately dropped into the starting lineup. With Kelvin Sheppard demanding more from the team’s pass rush and even considering altering the scheme, having a player like Davenport at his disposal will certainly help.

Rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart has missed each of New York's last two games while in the NFL's concussion protocol, and the Giants remained winless in games the rookie has not started. Will Dart play against the New England Patriots on ""Monday Night Football""?

Dart suffered his head injury in a Week 10 loss to the Chicago Bears – resulting in his fourth concussion check since the Giants' final preseason game. Team doctors diagnosed the rookie with a concussion, putting him in the NFL's five-step concussion protocol that he had to clear before returning. The Mississippi product reached the penultimate step of the five-part protocol last week but was unable to clear the final hurdle before Week 12's loss to the Detroit Lions.

That changed in Week 13, and Big Blue's first-round pick will indeed make his highly anticipated return to action as the calendar turns to December.

Here's what to know about Dart's status for ""Monday Night Football"":

Is Jaxson Dart playing today?

Yes. Dart will make his first start since Week 10. The Giants rookie's eighth career start will be against the team that New York defeated in its last two Super Bowl appearances: the Patriots.

Dart will face off against a fellow young gunslinger in New England's rising star and second-year quarterback Drake Maye. Maye is among betting favorites to win this year's NFL MVP award, while Dart is second in BetMGM's betting odds to win the Offensive Rookie of the Year award.

The Giants quarterback may have been more of a shoo-in for the award if he hadn't missed New York's last two games while working his way through the NFL's concussion protocol. Dart suffered his head injury in a Week 10 loss in Chicago, which was one of the final nails in the coffin for head coach Brian Daboll. The Giants fired him after the game.

New York is winless (0-5) in games in which Dart has not started behind center. Veterans Winston (0-2) and Russell Wilson (0-3) both struggled at times and were both unable to overcome late-game defensive collapses.

The Giants are already mathematically eliminated from playoff contention, but Dart's return for the final stretch gives the team a bit of intrigue for the last six weeks of the season.

Jaxson Dart stats

Dart took over as the Giants' starting quarterback in Week 4 after the team got off to an 0-3 start. He has since missed two games while dealing with a concussion he suffered in Week 10.

Here's how the rookie's stats look through seven career starts:

Completion rate: 128-of-204 (62.7%)

Passing yards: 1,417

Touchdowns: 10

Interceptions: 3

Passer rating: 93.5

Rushing: 57 attempts for 317 yards (5.6 yards per carry) and seven touchdowns

Giants QB depth chart

Jaxson Dart (active – concussion protocol)

Jameis Winston

Russell Wilson

Dart is active for his first game since Week 10's loss to the Bears. Winston was elevated to the team's backup quarterback spot after that game, and he started each of the Giants' last two games against the Green Bay Packers and Detroit Lions.

Wilson, like Winston, was a veteran free agent New York signed in the offseason. After beginning the year as Big Blue's starting quarterback, he struggled to run the offense and slid to the third spot on the Giants' depth chart.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/01/USAT/87551231007-jaxson-dart-giants-imagn.jpg?crop=4803,2702,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-01 18:05:23.553269

The team released veteran wideout Adam Thielen on Monday at his request, allowing the 35-year-old to finish his career with another franchise.

Thielen and the Vikings confirmed the news with posts on social media Monday. The team said Thielen approached it about finishing out his NFL career in a competitive situation. The Vikings decided to grant that wish.

Thielen confirmed as much, saying this will be his final season in the NFL and he wanted to compete over the final weeks of his career.

While Thielen didn't explicitly say it, it's pretty clear the veteran is hoping for a Super Bowl run before he hangs up his cleats. That wasn't going to come with the Vikings. After nearly winning the NFC North last year, the Vikings find themselves at 4-8 this season thanks to poor quarterback play, among other issues. With the playoffs all but out of the question for the Vikings, Thielen will look to hook on with a team still in the hunt.

The 35-year-old hasn't been super involved in the Vikings' offense this season. Through 11 games, Thielen has just eight receptions for 69 yards. He likely wouldn't start on a more competitive team, but could provide solid depth with the playoffs quickly approaching.

Advertisement

Whether he can catch on with another club depends on how the rest of the NFL views Thielen at this point in his career. During his prime, he was a sure-handed, target commander with a knack for getting open in the end zone.

From 2016-2022, Thielen averaged nearly 1,000 yards and 7.7 touchdowns per season with the Vikings. He made two Pro Bowls over that period, earning a second team All-Pro nod in 2017. Though his yardage totals dropped at the back end of that stretch, Thielen made up for it with his end-zone dominance. He caught 14 touchdowns in 15 games in 2020 and 10 in 2021 despite only playing in 13 games.

Advertisement

Following the 2022 NFL season, Thielen joined the Carolina Panthers on a three-year deal. He gained over 1,000 receiving yards in his first season with team.

After a down year in 2024, the Panthers agreed to trade Thielen back to the Vikings in a draft-pick swap. He hasn't emerged as a big option back in Minnesota, though the team does have both Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison on its depth chart, making it hard for Thielen to make a significant impact.

If contending NFL teams still believe Thielen has something left, he could still fulfill his dream of competing for a title before his career is over. If not, there's always the possibility a late injury opens the door for Thielen to get one more shot at a Super Bowl win.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Rf16GuxrZuwWiD.UxkjeMQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/5572e1b0-ceda-11f0-adff-7e91f3593ddb,N,,2025-12-01 18:05:32.223476

Wiggins is day-to-day, Head Coach John Harbaugh said Monday.

""We'll see where he's at on Wednesday and we'll see where he's at going forward from there,"" Harbaugh said.

The Ravens would love to have Wiggins play Sunday in a huge AFC North matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers at M&T Bank Stadium.

If he cannot play, the Ravens still have Marlon Humphrey and Chidobe Awuzie as their top two cornerbacks, with T.J. Tampa and Keyon Martin as the top backups.

In Aaron Rodgers' first game back from a fractured wrist Sunday against the Buffalo Bills, he threw for 117 yards, and burly tight end Darnell Washington was the leading receiver with two catches for 45 yards.

Justice Hill to Return this Season; Rasheen Ali Steps in Well

Justice Hill went on injured reserve last week before the Ravens placed the Bengals, but it isn't a season-ending neck injury, Harbaugh said.

Harbaugh said Hill had a disc issue that was bothering him and started causing issues. He's expected to miss three to four weeks.

""Justice does have a chance to come back,"" Harbaugh said.

Rasheen Ali stepped into Hill's role and played the most snaps (29) of any of the team's running backs against the Bengals. That was partly because the Ravens were in their two-minute offense so much as they tried to claw their way from behind.

Harbaugh commended Ali on the job he did Thursday night, but also would've liked for Derrick Henry and Keaton Mitchell to have more action.

""He played really well,"" Harbaugh said. ""He pass protected well, he ran his routes well, he chipped well. He had one run I thought he was tentative on.""

Rookie linebacker Chandler Martin will not return this season, however, and will undergo surgery to repair a torn ACL suffered on the opening kickoff Thursday night. He had five special teams tackles in two games.

""He started to establish himself. That was neat to see as a young player,"" Harbaugh said.

Tavius Robinson, Ar'Darius Washington Set to Return to Practice

There's a ""good chance"" that two key Ravens defenders, outside linebacker Tavius Robinson and safety Ar'Darius Washington, return to practice this week, Harbaugh said.

Robinson has been sidelined since suffering a foot injury in Week 5 against the Houston Texans. Washington has been rehabbing since going down with a torn Achilles injury in May.

Robinson is a rugged run defender that the Ravens would love to plug back into the mix up front. He also had two sacks in the first five games.

The Ravens are already using Kyle Hamilton, Malaki Starks, and Alohi Gilman on nearly every defensive snap, so it's tougher to project how Washington would be used upon his return, but he is a versatile and strong player who would help.

Harbaugh Discusses Emery Jones Jr.'s Debut and His Future Role

Harbaugh indicated that left guard is likely to remain the only position this season for rookie Emery Jones Jr., who saw his first NFL action against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Jones played 16 snaps in a rotation with starter Andrew Vorhees, who had 44 snaps. Jones can also play right guard, where Daniel Faalele has started every game, but the Ravens want to avoid putting too much on Jones' plate.

""It's possible, but it's hard to do,"" Harbaugh said of playing both left and right guard. ""Take a rookie and put him on both sides, you kind of compound the [learning] curve.""

Harbaugh said Jones showed promise as he continued to develop as a third-round pick from LSU. He underwent shoulder surgery after the Combine and did not begin practicing until Oct. 1.

""I thought he played hard and showed some athleticism and some fight and some gusto,"" Harbaugh said. ""Played like a rookie in a lot of ways, a lot of things to clean up. He'd be the first to tell you that.

""But you can't really start making those improvements until you play. He got a chance to do that, which was really positive. We just have to see going forward how much we want to continue that [rotation] as we go.""

Harbaugh Can Only Live With Extending Ball Near Goal Line 'When It Turns Out Good'

Isaiah Likely committed one of Baltimore's five turnovers against the Bengals, getting the ball knocked out of his hands when he extended it just before reaching the goal line.

Harbaugh made it clear that extending the ball near the goal line should only be done with the utmost caution. Zay Flowers also lost a crucial fumble in the 2023 AFC championship game after he extended the ball near the goal line while being tackled.

""I want the ball secured in ball security position – high and tight, period,"" Harbaugh said. ""Extending the ball on the goal line has its place, when you've got two strong hands on the ball and you have space and there's no traffic. I see that, I can live with that. [But] I can only live with it when it turns out good. Because even if you do that and you don't execute it, then it was too much.""

Harbaugh understands the temptation of wanting to reach out the ball, but it's a risky move that can be very costly.

""You have to make a little bit of an allowance for pro football players who are very talented,"" Harbaugh said. ""You see some great plays made. We're not going to coach our guys out of that. But when you take it to the next level of doing something that's not sound, that's not good. That's not winning football.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/ravens/momubfdpixwliz0eb2pw,N,,2025-12-01 17:04:19.215681

Gardner, traded to Indianapolis from the New York Jets last month in a stunning transaction, sustained the injury on the first defensive series against Houston, prompting fears that he might have sustained a dreaded Achilles tear.

Gardner could not initially walk without assistance and did not return to the game. He was provided crutches by the team's medical staff but was later able to walk gingerly without assistance after the game. After further examination Monday, the news was positive, Steichen said.

""His Achilles is good to go, but he'll probably miss some time,"" he said of Gardner. ""How much time? I do not know at the moment.""

Placing Gardner on injured reserve, which would require him to miss a minimum of four games, is not a consideration, Steichen said. The Colts (8-4) have five regular-season games remaining and are in a fight for a spot in the AFC playoff field.

Gardner's absence changes things for the Colts. They had intended to use him and fellow standout cornerback Charvarius Ward in static roles on the right and left sides of the defense, respectively. But Gardner's injury upended that plan, with Ward switching roles Sunday and following Houston's top receiver, Nico Collins, around the formation. That made for a much heavier lift.

""Just having to rise to the occasion,"" Ward said Monday. ""I don't think I played well. ... I'll get better, though.""

Collins had five catches for 98 yards in the game. It was just the second game with Gardner and Ward paired in the Colts' backfield, with Ward having returned from injured reserve just one week earlier.

Backup quarterback Trey Lance took over on the next Los Angeles possession, and the Chargers announced that Herbert was questionable to return with a left-hand injury.

Herbert returned to the sideline with a padded glove on his injured left hand and did work with footballs to test his ability to play with the injury. He replaced Lance in the middle of the drive after determining that he could continue.

He played the remainder of the game while wearing the protective glove. He completed 15 of 20 passes for 151 yards with 2 touchdowns and 1 interception. Running back Kimani Vidal paced the Chargers' offense with a 126 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries.

The Arizona Cardinals will continue to navigate their backfield without Trey Benson, as the promising young running back remains on injured reserve with no firm return date in sight. Benson has been working his way back from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the recovery has taken longer than initially hoped. With Week 14 approaching, the uncertainty surrounding his availability has become one of the team’s most closely watched storylines. Benson hasn’t appeared in a game since Week 4, and while he was designated to return from injured reserve on November 19, the Cardinals have yet to activate him. He logged a limited practice earlier in the week, but his subsequent absence raised questions about whether he experienced a setback. Although speculation continues, head coach Jonathan Gannon has kept details guarded, reiterating that Benson’s status is being evaluated on a day-to-day basis as the deadline to activate him draws near.

Trey Benson activation deadline approaches with Week 15 emerging as most likely return target

The Cardinals have until December 10 to decide whether to bring Benson back to the active roster, giving them a shrinking window to make a call. Reports from team insider Darren Urban suggest that the next week will be a crucial checkpoint, especially with the 21-day activation period nearing its conclusion. Despite early signs of progress, Benson finishing the week as a non-participant in practice has tempered expectations for a Week 14 return.

Trey Benson 🔥 Scariest RB in College Football ᴴᴰ

This makes Week 15 the more realistic target, barring a significant improvement in his condition. The Cardinals continue to approach Benson’s recovery with caution, mindful of both his long-term health and the importance of having him fully ready when he returns. In the meantime, Arizona’s depth at running back remains under pressure, and the team must keep adjusting its offensive approach while awaiting clarity on Benson’s comeback. As the Cardinals push deeper into the season, Benson’s recovery timeline remains a key storyline for fans tracking roster decisions and the team’s offensive rhythm. His return could provide a valuable boost, but for now, all signs point to continued patience as Week 14 approaches, making his comeback even more critical.

This is actually the first time in NFL history where there are five divisions that include a lead under one game this late in a season. That includes the NFC North, as the 9-3 Chicago Bears lead the 8-3-1 Green Bay Packers, who are one spot above the 7-5 Detroit Lions.

The Bears are now the No. 1 seed in the NFC following the Los Angeles Rams' shocking loss to the Carolina Panthers, but Chicago's newfound top-seed hope could be shortlived. This Sunday, the Bears have to travel to Green Bay to play the Packers who would overtake Chicago in the division with a win. But where does all this leave the Lions?

Detroit is now officially a long shot to repeat as division champions, listed at +950 over at FanDuel Sportsbook. In fact, the Lions are currently listed as underdogs to make the playoffs straight up at +122. Following their Thanksgiving loss to the Packers, the Lions are in treacherous waters, and on Thursday night they'll host a red-hot Dallas Cowboys team that has won three straight games, a run which includes back-to-back victories over last season's Super Bowl participants.

Games and seasons don't come down to one play or one player, but if the Lions don't have this one player on the field Thursday against the Cowboys, their playoff chances will take a massive hit. That player is wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown.

The impact of Amon-Ra St. Brown

The Lions' WR1 suffered a low-ankle sprain early in the Week 13 loss to Green Bay, according to NFL Media. The injury can sideline a player for one to two weeks, but St. Brown is going to try to play through it. Remember, Detroit is already without tight end Sam LaPorta, so losing St. Brown could ground Jared Goff's offense.

According to CBS Sports Research, the Lions rank No. 1 in yards per play with St. Brown on the field since he began his NFL career in 2021, and No. 25 with him off the field. Detroit also ranks No. 2 in offensive efficiency with St. Brown on the field, and No. 16 with him sidelined. His 505 receptions rank second all-time in a player's first five career seasons, and he's recorded at least 1,161 yards receiving in each of the last three seasons, and double-digit touchdowns in the last two seasons.

While the Cowboys famously had a terrible defense early in the season, that is no longer the case. Dallas acquired star defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and linebacker Logan Wilson at the trade deadline, added linebacker DeMarvion Overshown and cornerback Shavon Revel Jr. to the lineup, and cornerback Trevon Diggs is expected back in the near future as well. And those consecutive wins against last seaon's AFC and NFC champs? The Cowboys are actually the only team in NFL history to beat both of the prior season's Super Bowl teams in a five-day span. The fact that they came back from a 21-0 deficit against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 12, and then fended off Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs on Thanksgiving just adds to the story.

If Lions fans are looking for a bit of good news, this team has alternated wins and losses in eight straight games. Plus, the last time the Lions and Cowboys met, Jerry Jones experienced his largest home loss in the form of a 47-9 beatdown. However, this Lions defense has struggled as of late, and the offense could be dealt a tough hand in not having LaPorta or St. Brown on the field for this pivotal Week 14 NFC showdown.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/01/4f060c11-2318-4662-ba89-c31d4195ea99/thumbnail/1200x675/6fa865cd0e5b53cd7d5acbd76f8e930c/st-brown.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:05:14.299859

Brenden Jaimes and Bill Murray have starting experience from past stops, though they are both on the practice squad.

1. IF THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO CONSIDER FROM SUNDAY …

It’s that maybe Sam Darnold wouldn’t have fixed this Vikings team.

Back when the NFL schedule came out, Sam Darnold and the Vikings must have circled this week on their calendars. It would be somebody’s revenge game.

Seahawks versus Vikings.

NFC Heavyweights!

But leading into this game, we all knew how it would end — with a Seahawks win. The biggest surprise was that no one would walk away vindicated, if only because the Seahawks were not picking on someone their size. No, this was just a sadly lopsided game where Seattle looked like a superteam compared to the lowly Vikings.

The Vikings’ quarterback problems got to the point where people actually thought — myself included — that Max Brosmer, an undrafted free agent, might be an upgrade over J.J. McCarthy. No, Brosmer was just as bad as (and probably worse than) McCarthy.

Brosmer threw four interceptions.

The Vikings finished the game with 162 yards and 11 first downs on 13 drives.

They were so bad that I wonder if this was inevitable for Minnesota. And rather than thinking, Wow, Darnold really could’ve gotten this team into the playoffs and they should have re-signed him. I found myself thinking, Wow, maybe Darnold actually escaped a Minnesota team that would’ve sunk him.

And the Vikings have to figure out not just who they’ll play at quarterback but also how they’ll support him in ways that they failed to do this year. Coach Kevin O’Connell was awesome last year. But the quarterback whisperer might need to renew his reputation next year — and with whispers to a new quarterback.

But who?

One thing is for sure, Darnold is better off in Seattle, where all he had to do was throw for 128 yards in a blowout win. And given the inconsistency we’ve seen in the NFC, the Seahawks are legit contenders. They seem like the type of team that can support Darnold — and help him face his demons (ghosts?) in big games.

2. LOST MY TRUST & EARNED MY TRUST

Earned my trust: Jerry Jones

No owner is easier to mock than Jerry Jones. No general manager is easier to mock than Jones. And that’s partially because he’s the only guy who does both jobs, for better and for worse. But it’s also because he has the spirit of a Kardashian, enjoying the drama. It’s hard to tell — when Jones makes a major transaction (or doesn’t ink a major contract) — whether he’s doing something for team-building value or for entertainment value.

But just because it’s easy to mock him, it doesn’t mean it’s always right. So when Jones bailed on linebacker Micah Parsons and bought in on defensive tackles Quinnen Williams and Kenny Clark (while retaining some draft value in the process), people could not see the logic in it. And they ripped him.

I felt like I could see what Jones was trying to do — rebuilding the Cowboys’ shoddy defense in ways that he once did with the team’s offense in the 1990s after the Herschel Walker trade. It’s actually working. This defense has life, in large part because of Williams, who has been a monumentally better player for the Cowboys than he was for the Jets this season. Now, Parsons remains one of the NFL’s most dominant pass-rushers. That was on full display on Thanksgiving, with Parsons racking up 2.5 sacks and 10 pressures, per Next Gen Stats. But the Cowboys outlasted Patrick Mahomes because of their offense (built around Dak Prescott and their two receivers, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens) and their top-to-bottom defense, which is on the rise.

Mahomes was absolutely incredible. He played one of the best games I’ve seen him play in quite some time. Despite that, the Cowboys kept their season alive.

I’m starting to believe the Cowboys can make the playoffs. Which is empirically stupid. Their chances are just 17%. Make fun of me all you want. Make fun of Jones all you want. I’m starting to believe in the 2025 Cowboys.

Lost my trust: 49ers WR Ricky Pearsall

In the Niners' first four games, Pearsall put up two 100-yard games and totaled 20 catches for 327. He seemed to be on his way. There was a chance — a good chance — he could be the solution to San Francisco's receiver problem, with Brandon Aiyuk dealing with injuries (and attitude issues).

And then he suffered a knee injury that knocked him out for six weeks.

In the last three games since his return, he has just five catches for 20 yards. And now, Pearsall remains yet another uncertainty in the Niners' receiving corps. It hasn’t really mattered, because their defense has been dominant and tight end George Kittle has lifted the passing offense. But it has clouded the picture of whether Pearsall can be WR1.

3. BLIND PASSING CHART TEST

4. WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS AFRAID TO SAY:

The Panthers shouldn't give Bryce Young a big extension this offseason, but they should exercise his fifth-year option.

The Panthers’ upset over the Rams had me thinking: If the QB keeps this up, Carolina might feel like it has to extend Young.

It was an incredible game from Young — the best of his career. His total EPA was 15.1. His completion percentage over expected was 8.8. He was great against the blitz (5 of 6 for 93 yards). And of course, he was absolutely stellar on money downs, with a pair of long touchdowns on fourth down and a handful of impressive third-down conversions, including the game-clinching throw. He did all that against the Rams, the team we've considered the NFL’s best and most complete.

So, yeah, it’s time to start thinking about the Panthers' level of commitment to Young.

They could extend him as early as this offseason. That has been the trend recently, with teams like the San Francisco 49ers, Jacksonville Jaguars, Arizona Cardinals, Green Bay Packers and Philadelphia Eagles signing their quarterbacks to a big deal before their fourth season.

The Dolphins and Giants did their best to wait out Tua Tagovailoa and Daniel Jones, respectively, by going into their fourth year. But both teams ended up signing their guy — and for too much money. By waiting, they ended up backing themselves into a corner.

So how will Carolina handle Young? He has been so hot and cold from game to game. But if he keeps this up down the stretch, maybe the Panthers will consider inking him, especially if he makes a playoff game and/or wins it.

Before considering a long-term commitment, Canales should look at the Miami Dolphins and decide if that’s what’s about to happen to him. Canales and Young are doing roughly what Mike McDaniel and Tua did together when they were at their best. But over the past two years, that all fell apart without the team ever really contending. After his massive contract extension, Tua took on too much cap space for a QB of his value. McDaniel — one of the brightest offensive minds — couldn’t contend with a defense that wasn’t good, especially when his offense began to lose quality talent.

I like Canales. I like Young. Similarly, I like McDaniel and Tua.

The Panthers might not have to rush to decide on an extension, but they do have a deadline on his fifth-year option in May. Unless they plan to part ways with Young this offseason — or bring in direct competition — they should take on that extension. It’s a placeholder (that can burn the team), but is a good piece of contract leverage if they want to sign the guy long term. Plus, it’s a show of good faith that the team wants Young to be their guy for the long term.

5. RANDOM RANKING

The AFC South

Jacksonville Jaguars: In basically every metric, the other teams are better than Jacksonville. But it’s coach Liam Cohen that has me believing in the Jaguars at this point in the year. He has quietly put himself in consideration for the Coach of the Year award, managing the human roller-coaster that is Trevor Lawrence — and making wins happen despite the erratic QB. There’s so much talent on this Jacksonville roster. Cohen is the first Jaguars coach in a long time who is getting the most out of that talent.

Houston Texans: The Texans also have a great defense. They also have an erratic QB. They also have a lot of talent. And while DeMeco Ryans has continued to get the most out of his defense, offensive coordinator Nick Caley is still figuring out how to get C.J. Stroud back onto an upward trajectory.

Indianapolis Colts: Oh no. Is the collapse upon us? Jones continued to look messy on money downs (third and fourth), completing just two of his final seven passes for 44 yards and a sack. His inability to handle blitzes and pressure has proven an Achilles heel in the last few games. The Colts have two games against the Jaguars and another game against the Texans. It might be a heartbreaking finish for Indy.

Tennessee Titans: At least they haven’t ruined Cam Ward? He could be good!

6. HE SAID WHAT!?

Part 1 — Browns defensive tackle Shelby Harris called 49ers wideout Jauan Jennings ""a h--.""

Browns defensive tackle Shelby Harris did not mince words when weighing in on 49ers receiver Jauan Jennings, who exchanged words with Browns defenders after Maliek Collins went down with an injury.

""He’s a h--,"" Harris said after the game, via ABC Cleveland’s Camryn Justice. ""He said some things that you should not say to another man — ever. But I don’t respect it because you say that and then run behind your O-line. That’s some real soft s---. I want that known. I see exactly why they punched you in the nuts. I'm surprised they didn't punch you in the jaw yet.""

Jennings was involved in a controversy last week where Panthers safety Tre’von Moehrig punched Jennings … between the legs. The NFL gave Moehrig a one-game suspension for it.

Part 2 — NFL analyst Richard Sherman: ""I don’t think I have seen any team manhandle the Eagles like the Bears are tonight.""

The Bears own the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and I think I’m as guilty as anyone of conflating the hype around Caleb Williams with the hype around Chicago.

We’re getting ahead of ourselves when it comes to ""Cardiac Caleb,"" who has been good — and who has improved greatly since the beginning of the season. But his progress has not been the reason the Bears are such a good football team right now.

No, that’s because of coach Ben Johnson. (Who, by the way, is partially to credit for Johnson’s progress.)

Johnson has modeled his team after the Detroit Lions, who — for years — have displayed a rare blend of toughness and flashy explosiveness. That’s what the Bears are. And by borrowing the Lions’ identity, they have seemingly drained Detroit to fill up Chicago with that identity.

We saw that against the Eagles, who are a flagging team — lost for an identity. Richard Sherman said it. The Bears absolutely manhandled the Eagles. Even when they’re vulnerable, that’s not easy to do. The Bears aren't the best team in football. But they’re dangerous. And they’re a heck of a lot of fun.

7. WHAT I’M THANKFUL FOR …

Football is a remarkable game. But in my line of work, it’s easy to focus on tense, complicated or fraught topics. It’s Thanksgiving weekend, so it feels like a great moment to acknowledge all the football things I’m grateful for …

The players … deceptive eyes … quarterback controversies … Jahmyr Gibbs … Micah Parsons … Jaxon Smith-Njigba … the ghost rush … ""The eye in the sky don’t lie"" … fourth-quarter comebacks … a type of onside kick you’ve never seen before … exotic third-down blitzes … seeing a blockbuster at the NFL trade deadline … Tex stunt … left tackle ""eligible receiver"" touchdowns … that feeling you get in early April that the draft will never arrive … that friend you ask for fantasy football advice … Andy Reid … Patrick Mahomes … Tom Brady … LaDainian Tomlinson … ""Let’s name some guys"" … Kenbrell Thompkins … no-look throws …

What did I forget? Hit me up on Twitter, email, whatever.

The Bears helped Caleb Williams get a win on Friday. Not the other way around.

NFL teams have to submit a report on practice participation on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for a Sunday game. There are three levels of practice participation that can be designated: did not participate, limited participation and full participation.

A game status report is due by 4 p.m. Friday for Sunday games.

Here is the Bills vs. Bengals injury report for Week 14:

Buffalo Bills injury update for Week 14

Dalton Kincaid, TE, hamstring

Dalton Kincaid has missed the last three games since suffering a hamstring injury in Week 10.

He hobbled off the field grabbing his right hamstring in the third quarter of Week 10 and walked to the Bills locker room with trainers. Kincaid did not return.

Kincaid, who missed Week 6 with an oblique injury, has 29 catches for 448 receiving yards and a team-high four touchdown receptions.

Dion Dawkins, OT, concussion

Dion Dawkins did not play in Week 13 after suffering a concussion in the Week 12 loss to the Houston Texans.

The four-time Pro Bowler Dion Dawkins was evaluated for a concussion in the final minute of the first quarter was briefly replaced by Ryan Van Demark before he was cleared to return. But Dawkins displayed more symptoms the next day and was ruled out for Week 13 against the Steelers.

Spencer Brown, OT, shoulder

Spencer Brown was inactive for the Week 13 win over the Steelers after toughing out most of Week 12 with a shoulder injury.

Brown was evaluated for the injury after grabbing his right shoulder in the third quarter and was cleared to return. Brown struggled after re-entering the game and was replaced in the fourth quarter by Ryan Van Demark.

Brown was spotted with his arm in a sling in the locker room after the game.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Nov. 21 that Brown ""potentially"" could go on injured reserve.

Terrel Bernard, LB, elbow

Terrel Bernard did not play in Week 13.

The Bills' defensive captain was suffered a dislocated elbow after being in on a tackle for a 1-yard loss on Houston running back Nick Chubb in Week 12. Bernard lied on his stomach in pain and rolled onto his back holding his right arm as he was tended to by athletic trainers. He walked into the locker room holding his right arm in the third quarter and returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling.

Bernard is considered week-to-week, according to Bills head coach Sean McDermott.

Bernard has 56 tackles, seven tackles for loss, one interception and two fumble recoveries in 10 games in 2025.

Joshua Palmer, WR, ankle

Joshua Palmer missed Week 13 after re-aggravating an ankle injury.

He was out three games from Weeks 8 through 10 after being dragged down by Atlanta Falcons cornerback Dee Alford after a 15-yard reception in the second quarter in Week 6.

Joey Bosa, DE, hamstring

Joey Bosa suffered a hamstring injury on a pass rush and exited the game against the Steelers. He walked off under his own power and was listed as questionable to return.

Bosa's strip sack on the first play from scrimmage in the third quarter resulted in a 17-yard fumble return for a touchdown by cornerback Christian Benford and turned the tide in the Bills win.

Bosa leads the Bills with five sacks and five forced fumbles, which ties a single-season franchise record.

Buffalo Bills injured reserve

Mecole Hardman, WR, calf

Mecole Hardman was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 20 after playing one game the Bills.

He was injured in Week 11 and did not return after suffering a calf injury in the third quarter. Hardman's first touch with was a 61-yard kickoff return in the first quarter. He muffed a punt that resulted in a lost fumble the third quarter, which is when he suffered the calf injury.

Landon Jackson, DE, knee

Landon Jackson was injured on his second defensive snap against the Dolphins in Week 10.

The rookie third-round pick came off the left edge on a run by Ollie Gordon and fought off a block before falling backward. He immediately brought his right knee to his chest and grabbed it in pain and trainers evaluated him on the field.

Jackson was ruled out for the game shortly after. He returned to the Bills sideline in the second half with a brace on his right knee and using crutches.

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Ed Oliver, DT, biceps

Ed Oliver suffered a torn biceps injury which will require surgery and is out indefinitely. He was placed on on injured reserve on Oct. 28 and is eligible to return in Week 13.

Oliver was hurt in the second quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.

Oliver, who had a sack on the first possession of the game, went into the medical tent and FOX cameras showed him speaking with trainers and pointing to his left arm. He returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling under his hooded sweatshirt.

Oliver is tied for the team lead with three sacks despite only plying in three of the Bills' seven games.

He missed four games earlier this season (Weeks 2-5) with an ankle injury after he got stepped on in practice on Sept. 10.

Taylor Rapp, S, knee

Taylor Rapp was placed on injured reserve on Oct. 24.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Rapp was battling an injury since training camp and ""it got to the point where he can't be himself.""

Rapp ha 26 tackles in six games this season.

Michael Hoecht, DE, Achilles

Michael Hoecht tore his right Achilles in the fourth quarter of the win against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.

He suffered the non-contact injury while taking one step into his rush off the left edge with 14:25 remaining. Hoecht was unable to put pressure on his right leg. He waved off the cart that drove into the field to take him to the locker room. Instead, Hoecht hobbled off with the help of trainers and stayed on the bench with his teammates for the rest of the game.

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

""It's a big loss,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. “I feel terrible for him.”

Tyler Bass, K, left hip/groin

Tyler Bass was placed on injured reserve on Friday, Sept. 5 after he was unable to practice the day prior. Bass missed most of training camp with pelvic soreness, sitting out from July 28 to Aug. 19 before returning for the preseason finale. He went 3-for-4 in that game, connecting from 37, 37 and 39 yards before pushing a 26-yarder wide right.

Bass was eligible to return in Week 5 against the New England Patriots but has not had his 21-day practice window opened.

Matt Prater, 41, signed to the Bills practice squad, was elevated for Week 1 and made a 32-yard game-winning field goal with no time left to defeat the Baltimore Ravens 41-40 in Week 1. Prater has since been signed to the active roster and is 10-for-11 on field goals and 17-for-17 on extra points through six games.

Cameron Johnston, P, foot/ankle

Cameron Johnston suffered left foot and ankle injuries after taking a hit to his left plant leg on a punt in the fourth quarter in the Week 4 win over the Saints. The Bills placed him on injured reserve on Sept. 30 and signed punter Mitch Wishnowsky.

New Orleans linebacker Nephi Sewell crashed into Johnston’s left leg and was flagged for a roughing the kicker penalty. Johnston, 33, immediately slammed his helmet to the turf in frustration before hobbling off with trainers.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead. He walked to the X-ray room after the game.

Johnston was carted off the field with a season-ending right knee injury in Week 1 last season after taking a low shot while playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Dorian Strong, CB, neck

Dorian Strong played in four games with one start before suffering a neck injury and being placed on injured reserve on Oct. 4. The rookie sixth-round pick was eligible to return in Week 10.

Damar Hamlin, S, pectoral

Damar Hamlin suffered pectoral injury in practice Oct. 9 and was placed on injured reserve.

He was eligible to return in Week 11, although Bills coach Sean McDermott said it's ""up in the air"" if Hamlin's injury is season-ending.

Hamlin started 14 games in 2024 but has played a reserve role this year with Cole Bishop and Taylor Rapp as the starting safeties. He has one tackle in five games.

DeWayne Carter, DT, Achilles

DeWayne Carter suffered a torn Achilles and will miss the entire 2025 season.

Carter, a 2024 third-round pick, recorded 14 tackles, five tackles for loss, three quarterback hits and a pass defended in 11 games last year.

Wande Owens, S, undisclosed

The undrafted rookie was waived Aug. 23 with an injury designation and went unclaimed on waivers.

Cincinnati Bengals injury update for Week 14

Tee Higgins, WR, concussion

Tee Higgins did not play in Week 13 after suffering a concussion in Week 12.

Higgins is in the league's concussion protocol and did not practice last week. He has 40 receptions for 575 yards and seven touchdowns in 2025.

Trey Hendrickson, DE, hip/pelvis

Trey Hendrickson has been out the last four games and hasn't played since Week 8. He didn't practice last week.

Hendrickson has 16 tackles and four sacks, after back-to-back 17.5-sack seasons in 2023 and 2024.

Brian Asamoah II, LB, knee

Brian Asamoah suffered a left knee injury in the second quarter of the Thanksgiving win against the Baltimore Ravens. In the third quarter, he was ruled out for the remainder of the game.

Asamoah, who began the season on the Las Vegas Raiders practice squad before joining the Bengals' practice squad, is a 2022 third-round pick who ha 30 career tackles in 50 games.

Tahj Brooks, RB, concussion

Tahj Brooks suffered a concussion in Week 12 against the Patriots. He went into the blue medical tent after the kickoff to start the third quarter and then walked to the locker room.

The rookie sixth-round pick did not practice last week or play in the Week 13 win over the Ravens on Thanksgiving.

Jermaine Burton, WR, ankle

Jermaine Burton has not played this season. He was inactive as a healthy scratch the first 11 games and was listed as out with an ankle injury on Thanksgiving in Week 12.

The 2024 third-round pick had four receptions for 107 yards in 14 games as a rookie but did not travel with the team for their season finale in Pittsburgh last year. Earlier that week he was allegedly involved in a domestic dispute with his ex-girlfriend.

From a big-picture perspective, Fox’s injury could accelerate the clock on hard choices facing team president and general manager Chris Drury.
What looked like a fringe playoff team with Fox could see its postseason hopes fade away without him.","The New York Rangers are placing Adam Fox on long-term injured reserve and expecting him to miss multiple weeks due to a left-shoulder injury, according to two league sources.

The injury was sustained on a hit from Tampa Bay Lightning forward Brandon Hagel that crunched Fox into the boards during the third period of Saturday’s 4-1 loss at Madison Square Garden. It isn’t believed to be long-term or season-threatening, but it will require some time on the shelf. The team plans to label it as week-to-week and reevaluate around Christmas, one source said.

The loss of Fox leaves the Rangers in a precarious position. While the team has largely struggled through the first quarter of the season, the 27-year-old defenseman has been their best and most consistent player.

Fox pushed his point streak to six games with the primary assist on J.T. Miller’s second-period goal Saturday, and he is tied with Artemi Panarin for the team lead with 26 points (three goals and 23 assists) through 27 games. His 10.1 net rating is easily New York’s best, according to Hockey Stat Cards, with Panarin a distant second at 4.5.

Replacing Fox will be virtually impossible given the Rangers’ dearth of puck-moving defensemen. His D partner, Vladislav Gavrikov, is second among the team’s defensemen with 11 points (four goals and seven assists) and has been rock-solid since signing a seven-year, $49 million contract last summer, but he’s limited offensively and best-suited for a stay-at-home assignment. No other New York defensemen has more than five points.

Scott Morrow, who came to the Rangers as part of the July 1 trade that sent talented defenseman K’Andre Miller to the Carolina Hurricanes, is expected to get an extended look in Fox’s absence. The 23-year-old profiles as the most skilled defensemen in New York’s thin pipeline after racking up 94 points (28 goals and 66 assists) across 109 career games at UMass, then another 39 points (13 goals and 26 assists) while earning an AHL all-star nod last season with the Chicago Wolves. But he’s off to a slow start with AHL Hartford, with only three points (one goal and two assists) through 12 games that another league source described as uneven.

The Rangers sent Morrow to Hartford to work on his defensive game and will likely use him in a sheltered five-on-five role, but they’ll need his offensive side to shine if they’re going to get any production out of their back end. He could get the first crack at assuming Fox’s position as the quarterback of a top power-play unit that’s short on alternatives.

Braden Schneider is another defenseman who will be asked to step up. The Rangers have talked for years about wanting to expand the 24-year-old’s role, but he’s been blocked by Fox and others on the right-handed depth chart. Now there’s a clear path to the top four, or perhaps even on the top pair with Gavrikov.

Those are decisions coach Mike Sullivan will have to make in the immediate future. From a big-picture perspective, Fox’s injury could accelerate the clock on hard choices facing team president and general manager Chris Drury.

The Rangers have shown defensive improvement under Sullivan, but their lack of offensive firepower and team speed have become glaring issues. They ranked 28th in the NHL with an average of just 2.63 goals per game entering play Sunday, and now they’re missing one of the league’s best playmaking defensemen.

What looked like a fringe playoff team with Fox could see its postseason hopes fade away without him. Drury will likely allow time to see if the Rangers can weather the storm, but he must recognize that the roster has deteriorated on his watch and needs revamping.

Rather than attempting to keep an unsteady ship afloat, the wise approach might be a reset in which Drury recoups some of the assets he sold off at previous trade deadlines and aims to infuse a depleted organization with young talent. That would require a stamp of approval from owner James Dolan, though, and there’s no telling if he’ll provide Drury that kind of assurance coming off last season’s crash-and-burn.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/30134413/GettyImages-1244765879-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-01 15:03:40.593359

The Giants hope Dart can take it the rest of the way without any more interruptions.","FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — He did not play in the game, but Jaxson Dart certainly looked engaged afterward, sitting in a corner of the visitors locker room inside Ford Field in Detroit, where three quarterbacks huddled together discussing what just transpired.

There was Dart, the rookie in his second week in concussion protocol.

There was Russell Wilson, a former star, now benched.

There was Jameis Winston, third string elevated into the starting job.

Winston did enough to win but, as usual, the Giants lost and the three quarterbacks were engrossed in conversation.

This looked and felt like a tutorial for Dart and he listened more than he spoke.

This trio broke down the game with one another and it was obvious the discussion was meaningful to all involved.

It was tempting at that moment to wonder how having these two accomplished veterans around him every week, to watch, to lean on, to learn from will serve Dart in the years to come.

The foundation for what the Giants hope will be a lengthy career for Dart is being set in what has already been an enthralling, turbulent and frustrating NFL initiation.

It continues Monday night when Dart returns from a two-week hiatus to face the Patriots at Gillette Stadium in a meeting of the first-place home team and the last-place road team.

The Giants are 2-10, Dart is 2-5 as a starter and he has been indoctrinated into what life is all about with a team that cannot find its way.

Five times this season, the Giants held a lead in the fourth quarter, only to lose.

Dart has felt the pain of these defeats.

“The season so far has been tough because our record could completely be flipped the other way and everybody here is in a completely different state of mind,’’ Dart said. “But I’ve just come to realize that in the NFL, if you don’t make those crunch-time moment plays and the other team does, you’re going to lose, and it doesn’t really matter how well you play up until the end of the game.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST NFL STANDINGS AND GIANTS STATS

“So, at times, it honestly doesn’t even feel real because you feel like you’re in control of the entire game and somehow things just don’t work. That’s just the beauty of the sport is it could go one way, it could go the other way and when you’re playing at this level of competition, especially for me, I’ve come to realize that it doesn’t matter how you play at all until, who scores last, who has the ball last and who makes that last crucial play at the end of the game.’’

It will be quite an accomplishment if Dart can keep the Giants — losers of six straight — close for this game to come down to crucial plays at the end of the game.

The Patriots (10-2) are on a nine-game winning streak, their second-year quarterback, Drake Maye, is an MVP candidate and Mike Vrabel is the favorite to win the Coach of the Year award.

Dart’s head was slammed to the ground as he lost a fumble two weeks ago in Chicago and he did not make the required progress last week to get medical clearance to return to the field.

Add this to the long list of lessons for Dart to learn.

And also, patience.

“It’s hard,’’ he said. “I feel like every day goes by slower and you’re hoping and praying that you’re going to go in and pass your test to make it. I think I bit more nails off my fingers than I have in a long time being on the sideline watching. But yeah, it’s definitely not fun to feel like you have no control over the outcome of the game, but you just try to be the best teammate that you can.’’

Wilson and Winston have been tremendous teammates for Dart, making this particular quarterback room beneficial for a rookie to grow.

Rodgers finished 10 of 21 for 117 yards, one of the worst outings of his career. A fractured left wrist forced him to play with a cast. He briefly exited the game at one point to bandage his bloodied nose following a strip-sack from behind by Joey Bosa.

Pittsburgh hopes to expand its options with Rodgers after another week of injury recovery.

""I felt good enough to be out there, just not ready to take a snap under center, hopefully next week for that,"" Rodgers said. ""Disappointed in my performance, disappointed in the offensive performance and got to flush it.""

Rodgers placed some of the blame on miscommunication and timing errors with his receivers. Tight end Darnell Washington led the Steelers with two catches for 45 yards. D.K. Metcalf was a non-factor for the second straight game, finishing with 32 yards on five targets. The ineptitude offensively led to a chorus of boos from the Steelers' home crowd in the second half.

""I totally understand the frustration,"" Rodgers said. ""I've been booed on offense, even in Green Bay over the years. That was a boo-worthy performance.""

Playoff outlook

Pittsburgh plays a pivotal road game Sunday against the Ravens, before concluding with Miami, Detroit, Cleveland and the season finale against Baltimore at home. With three games left against divisional competition including a pair of matchups with the AFC North co-leaders, the Steelers' playoff hopes will be ultimately determined by offensive production and if Rodgers can get back on track.

Rodgers and his receivers have to get on the same page in the film room first, he said.

""When there's film sessions, everybody shows up, and when I check to a route, you do the right route,"" Rodgers said. ""We have our meetings every week. We have other opportunities outside of the facility, and [I] look forward to seeing all the boys there.""

Pittsburgh is the second team out of the AFC's playoff picture in the No. 9 spot. The fourth-seeded Ravens own the tiebreaker over the Steelers for the time being based on best win percentage in common games.

Buffalo's 23 unanswered points in the second half were tough to stomach for the Steelers, who dropped five of their last seven games since starting the season 4-1.

Herbert suffered the injury on the first drive of the win over the Raiders, but returned in the second quarter with a padded glove over his left hand, and finished the game.

It's unclear if Herbert will miss time with the injury, with the Chargers set to face the Eagles on Monday. But Herbert told reporters postgame that he believes the surgery is simply meant to ""stabilize"" it and that doctors are ""hopeful"" he can play in Week 14.

Elsewhere in the AFC, Colts cornerback Sauce Gardner went down with an apparent calf strain in Indianapolis' loss to the Texans on Sunday. Gardner said postgame that he doesn't believe it was an Achilles injury, but that he will undergo additional tests to determine the severity, including how much time he might have to miss.

Overall, Sunday was also a big day for quarterbacks getting rocked: Bills defensive end Joey Bosa hit Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers so hard in Buffalo's win that Rodgers had to briefly exit the game with a bloody nose. And Jaguars QB Trevor Lawrence got decked by Titans linebacker Arden Key, with the hit quickly sparking a bench-clearing scuffle. Vikings backup QB Max Brosmer also had some poor luck, with the rookie taking four sacks in his first pro game — and throwing four picks — as Minnesota's quarterback struggles continue.

It would be amiss not to note one of the bigger developments of the weekend: After the Panthers stunned the Rams with a three-point upset win, the Chicago Bears are now the best team in the NFC, almost one year to the day after firing Matt Eberflus.

With quarterback CJ Stroud back in the lineup, the two-time defending South champion Texans got back in the division race. The Texans are 7-5, haven’t lost a division game this season and are third in the division, one win behind the Colts and Jaguars (8-4).

Stroud completed 22 of 35 passes for 276 yards and one interception and Nico Collins caught five passes for 98 yards and ran for a score. Stroud was 9-of-13 passing in the second half, including 3 of 3 on third down.

RJ Harvey’s rushing touchdown in overtime put the Broncos up before the Commanders scored and then attempted a two-point conversion that would have won the game.

San Francisco scored 19 unanswered points after trailing in the second quarter. All three of their touchdowns come from short fields, capitalizing on turnovers and a long punt return. Purdy completed 16 of 29 passes for 168 yards. San Francisco star Christian McCaffrey added 74 scrimmage yards and a touchdown. Sanders passed for 149 yards and a touchdown for Cleveland.

Minnesota Vikings 0-26 Seattle Seahawks

The Seattle Seahawks (9-3) shut out an opponent for the first time in more than a decade in their win over the Minnesota Vikings (4-8). Ernest Jones IV had the first of five takeaways by the Seahawks’ dominant defense. Jones returned an interception 84 yards for a touchdown. Seattle’s most recent shutout win was 26-0 over Chicago in September 2015. This one was a mismatch, with the Seahawks going against an undrafted rookie quarterback in Max Brosmer. Seattle moved into a first-place tie with the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC West, while Minnesota lost their fourth straight.

Arizona Cardinals 17–20 Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7-5) have snapped a three-game skid with victory over the Arizona Cardinals (3-9). Mayfield tossed a two-yard touchdown pass to All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs and Tampa Bay’s defense held in the final two minutes. Mayfield started after sitting out the second half of a 34-7 loss to the Rams because of a left shoulder injury. He threw for 194 yards and ran for 27 to help the Bucs remain first in the NFC South. Arizona have lost four straight and nine of 10.

The win moves Jacksonville (8-4) into a tie with the Indianapolis Colts atop the AFC South heading into the first of two matchups between the teams next week. The Jaguars outgained the Titans (1-11) 272-188. Tennessee were 2-for-12 on third downs and 1-for-4 on fourth downs. Jakobi Meyers had his best day since being traded to Jacksonville from the Las Vegas Raiders in November, with six catches for 90 yards and a touchdown. The Jaguars sacked Tennessee quarterback Cam Ward three times, with Josh Hines-Allen collecting two sacks.

It is not clear yet if Clowney, who was dealing with a neck injury that kept him limited in two of Dallas practices' leading into their game against the Chiefs on Thursday, is still dealing with the neck issue or a different injury.

The first injury report for the Cowboys ahead of their road game on Thursday against the Lions will come on Monday.

Abanikanda, 23, was a fifth-round pick out of Pitt by the New York Jets in 2023 where he appeared in six games and rushed for 70 yards on 22 carries. He was waived by New York in December of 2024, and since briefly spent time with the San Fransisco 49ers and most recently the practice squad of the Green Bay Packers.

After Malik Davis was signed to the active roster to be the second option at running back in recent weeks for the Cowboys, Dallas now has another running back on the practice squad in Abanikanda.

2:30 p.m. -- After Jerry Jones said earlier on Friday morning that he expects CB Trevon Diggs to return from injured reserve before Dallas' next game against the Lions, head coach Brian Schottenheimer said the team is expecting to open his 21-day practice window on Sunday.

""We'd love to start his clock and get him going. I'm excited to see Trevon and how he looks and moves around..."" Schottenheimer said. ""I think you should expect us to do that for Sunday.""

Schottenheimer added that the Cowboys will be off on Friday and Saturday before returning to practice on Sunday.

2:25 p.m. -- The Cowboys were hit with a good amount of injuries heading into, and coming out of their 31-28 win over the Chiefs on Thursday. The good news is nothing seems to be considered long term.

Head coach Brian Schottenheimer said on Friday that CB DaRon Bland was dealing with cramps early in the game, and left in the second half with a foot injury before ultimately returning for the end of the game. Fellow CB Caelen Carson was dealing with some soreness on the quick turnaround, and has a chance to play next Thursday against the Lions.

In the safety room, veteran Malik Hooker left the game with back spasms, according to Schottenheimer. The coach added ""he should be fine"" for next Thursday in Detroit.

11:00 a.m. -- After missing the last six games with a concussion and knee injury, the Cowboys should be getting CB Trevon Diggs back for next Thursday's road game against the Detroit Lions, according to Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones.

""He'll be on the field, wanted to be on the field last night, but he'll be on the field at Detroit in my view barring an [setback]."" Jones said on 105.3 The Fan Friday morning.

Diggs is currently on injured reserve, so he'll need to be activated and return to the active roster which while require a corresponding move. His return comes at a good time for Dallas, who has won three straight games and has seen injuries recently at cornerback to Caelen Carson, who missed Thursday's game against Kansas City, and DaRon Bland, who missed some time in the second half with a foot injury but later returned.

8:12 p.m. - While his streak of 140-yard games ended, Pickens still had a productive day for the Cowboys, totaling 88 receiving yards on six catches, along with a 2-point conversion in the fourth quarter.

Williams had just 59 rushing yards, but it moved him to 955, surpassing his previously high of 903 yards with the Broncos.

The biggest play of the game for Williams occurred in the passing game, when he caught a quick pass from Dak Prescott for a 3-yard touchdown, giving the Cowboys a 7-point lead.

2 p.m. -- Tyler Guyton suffered an ankle injury in the Cowboys' victory over the Eagles and, on a short week, was ruled out for the Thanksgiving bout against the Chiefs.

That means Nate Thomas will get the start at left tackle, and that's not the only position that will rely on a young player to step up and make an impact.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/u2qvjoynsm5vqnbq9ty0,N,,2025-12-01 12:05:56.090036

Jaxson Dart would light up and tell his father who he would want to face that day in tackling drills.
Jaxson Dart has that same defensive mindset.
It's Jaxson Dart.
Get Dart to slide rather than take on defenders head-on like he did earlier this season against the Philadelphia Eagles.","EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- It was the last play of Eli Manning's first career game during the 2004 season. The New York Giants legend was in during garbage time of a blowout loss to the Philadelphia Eagles when he tried to run around the pocket to make a play.

It ended poorly for Manning. The No. 1 pick earlier that year thought he had space, but that gross miscalculation saw him get torpedoed by Eagles defensive end Jerome McDougle, who was tracking back on the play. The blindside hit sent Manning flying to the turf and the ball onto the ground for a fumble as the clock hit zero.

Just 11 plays into his career, the rookie learned a quick lesson.

""That was my 'Welcome to the NFL' moment for sure,"" Manning said years later.

""I thought he was dead,"" his father Archie said after the game.

Eli Manning realized in his first game that the NFL was different than playing at Ole Miss. Some of the things he could get away with at the collegiate level didn't fly here.

Giants rookie Jaxson Dart's learning curve lasted slightly longer. His seventh start proved that if he doesn't alter his game, there will be repercussions. Dart suffered a concussion in a Nov. 9 loss to the Chicago Bears. It was the fourth time in eight games, dating back to the preseason, that Dart needed to be examined for a concussion.

It turned out to be the final straw for coach Brian Daboll. The hit occurred on Dart's sixth designed run of the contest.

The rookie has missed two games. He's expected back for the Giants on Monday night against the New England Patriots (8:15 p.m. EST, ESPN), but with the understanding that he can't keep playing recklessly. Interim coach Mike Kafka and the team are in the process of trying to fix it.

The Giants (2-10) enabled the foolhardy play to a degree under Daboll -- failing to emphasize the need to be more careful. Backup quarterback Jameis Winston, who has started two games in Dart's absence, said he would relay the message from the coaching staff and higher-ups, only when it was brought to him first. He didn't want Dart to change the way he plays football, the same way that helped him get to the NFL and the first round of the draft.

Sometimes, though, those few extra yards that Dart's heart and natural competitiveness desire are just not worth it -- especially if it's near midfield or when he already got the first down. After not being available for two games because of the concussion, his teammates realize something needs to change, for the long- and short-term benefit of the player and team.

""When he's running on the field [during practice], everyone's yelling, 'Slide! Slide!"" said tight end Theo Johnson, one of Dart's closest friends. ""I'm talking about in the building and at practice and stuff. People are like, we're all like, 'Hey, in the game, that's going to be a slide, right?' ""

""I say safeties and cornerbacks only,"" backup quarterback Jameis Winston said of who he should consider taking on 1-on-1 as a ball carrier. ""No D-linemen, no linebackers. Those are my initial things.""

""I've been telling him [to get down] since his first run in the preseason,"" starting offensive lineman Jon Runyan Jr. said.

""I tell him all the time. I'm like, 'Bro, please get down!'"" veteran wide receiver Darius Slayton said. ""Franchise quarterbacks, when they [get injured], season's over.""

The Giants can't have that happen. Keeping Dart healthy is a priority this season and moving forward. They have a lot invested in the first-round pick out of Ole Miss.

""Moving forward, I have to be more available for this team,"" Dart said this past week after getting cleared from the concussion protocol. ""This is obviously on the forefront of my mind moving forward.""

DART WAS A wild man on the field at Ole Miss. Former NFL head coach Jon Gruden described his playing style as ""reckless ... careless and ... dangerous"" after watching film from his college career. He predicted Dart would be in the blue medical tent often, getting checked for a concussion if it wasn't modified. That's exactly what has happened, on a fairly regular basis, early in his NFL career.

The Ole Miss coaching staff also regularly fought a similar battle with the uber-competitive quarterback, according to multiple sources. They too wanted Dart to protect himself better so he didn't have to leave or miss games.

The things you love about the success-driven quarterback are simultaneously what you fear most. But it's inherently him.

""He's always been a kid that things just kind of changed anytime there was a competitive atmosphere,"" said Brandon Dart, Jaxson's father. ""His competitive spirit just innately spiked. And so from the time he was a little guy, that's just how he operated. And so some of that I think is innate.""

Brandon Dart coached his son during his formative years in Utah. He chuckled during a phone conversation with ESPN at the thought of being engaged in chats with young Jaxson before practices. Jaxson Dart would light up and tell his father who he would want to face that day in tackling drills. It was always one of the bigger, tougher kids. Then, when he would prepare for drills, young Jaxson would shake his head, slap his head and get hyped.

""He just loved that part of football,"" Brandon Dart remembers. ""He just loved hitting; he loved tackling. He liked getting everybody hyped up. And it just puts a smile on my face because I just remember those days as a little kid. Just his love for the game. And that was just him. Everybody just knew. When you're up against J-Dart, you better bring it because you know what you're going to get out of him.""

This is what makes it so difficult to get Dart to stop trying to run over linebackers. It's who he is at his core. And it's what has always driven him to success.

Dart was a linebacker at the youth level. His father was a safety who played at the University of Utah. His brother, Diesel, is currently a three-star recruit at Corner Canyon High School in Utah whose primary position is also safety. Jaxson Dart has that same defensive mindset. He wants to deliver that hit more than take it, even though he's a quarterback and plays on the other side of the ball.

But this is the NFL, not college football or high school football in Utah.

""It is not running over SEC cornerbacks anymore,"" a high-level NFC executive warned prior to the draft. ""It's NFL safeties and linebackers. It's different.""

WHILE DART HAS struggled to stay out of the blue tent, he hasn't had any problem getting in the end zone. He has produced 17 total touchdowns in seven starts. All the Giants quarterbacks combined produced just 19 touchdowns last season.

Ten of Dart's touchdowns have been passing and seven are rushing scores. Dart has averaged 3.4 designed rushes per game this season. That's third behind only the Jets' Justin Fields and Eagles' Jalen Hurts. His 5.0 yards per rush on designed runs is second only behind Baltimore's Lamar Jackson.

Clearly, there is a lot to like with Dart. It's part of what makes the Giants' head coaching vacancy so desirable.

""First of all, it's the New York Giants,"" former NFL head coach Jon Gruden told ESPN. ""I mean it is one of the founding franchises of football. It's New York. It's Jaxson Dart. You know what kind of talent he is. You know he has the arm talent, the athleticism. I know he's a smart guy. He's a great competitor. I think that is pretty much a good summary of why this is a desirable job.""

For many, Dart's presence will be near the top of the list of why they want the job. Gruden raved about him predraft. He sees the potential in the young quarterback and nothing that's unfolded so far at the next level has changed his opinion.

Dart's talent and skills have seamlessly translated to the NFL. With him behind center, the Giants scored 30+ points against the Denver Broncos and Eagles. No other quarterback has put up 30 points against either of those defenses this season.

The early returns seem to indicate that Dart has a realistic chance to be a high-end quarterback.

""This has the potential to be a great situation,"" Gruden said. ""But Dart has to do his part. He's got to stay healthy. He has to stay out there. He has to be what he's supposed to be.""

It's contingent on him learning to avoid putting himself in danger.

THE GIANTS WILL now reinsert Dart into the lineup knowing they can't just operate the same way they did before the concussion. It's on them to make sure their prized possession doesn't get put into situations that are disadvantageous to his health.

""The best ability is availability,"" Winston said.

Perhaps that means Kafka will call fewer designed runs. Or maybe just stress more frequently and urgently to get down or out of bounds when Dart's near the boundaries post-concussion.

It sounds as if some changes will be made.

""Yeah, I mean, you definitely take it into account,"" recently promoted Giants offensive coordinator Tim Kelly said.

One offensive player told ESPN he didn't expect designed runs in this week's game plan against the Patriots. That should help limit the hits that Dart takes.

People both inside and outside the Giants organization spoke with Dart recently and urged the rookie quarterback to be more thoughtful with when and how he runs, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Quarterbacks coach Shea Tierney even said recently they've shown Dart videos of other quarterbacks to point out the difference between being aggressive and acting in self-preservation.

It's still a slippery slope. The Giants don't want to completely take away what makes Dart so dangerous in the first place.

""I'm still getting used to this game. I'm getting used to this speed, this level,"" Dart said. ""In college, you can watch my tape, I very rarely slid. This is a different beast. For me, I have to obviously be more responsible when I'm in the open field. But I felt I was getting better at it each and every week.""

Dart slid twice in Chicago before he was injured. He said this week he didn't take any unnecessary hits in that Bears game.

But Tierney said they're stressing to ""pick your spots."" It all depends on the game situation. When you're in the ""city"" with all kinds of people around, get down. When you're running in the ""country,"" keep running. Kelly even noted it's not worth fighting for every last yard in the first quarter.

Situational awareness is paramount. Experience is invaluable. Dart only gains it by playing. That is why it was so important for him to return this late in the season. He wanted to return last week but didn't clear the protocol.

The answer, it seems, isn't to overhaul the main circuit board. Just reconfigure a wire or two.

""There's a balance,"" Kafka said.

Get Dart to slide rather than take on defenders head-on like he did earlier this season against the Philadelphia Eagles. Get out of bounds rather than fight for a few extra yards near the sideline. Find a way to get to the ground and duck under big hits when there is traffic.

Manning turned into a master of avoiding big hits. The hope is that Dart can improve at it as well with more experience, even if it means still running and making plays with his legs.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1124%2Fr1580188_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 12:05:59.681154

The Patriots, riding a nine-game win streak, are heavy favorites against the Giants, who have lost six straight and who were the lone team eliminated from playoff contention prior to Thanksgiving.

After being sidelined the last two weeks, Dart (concussion) returns as QB1 for the Giants. The rookie has brought excitement and hope to the Giants, but that has yet to translate into wins.

The Patriots’ head into their bye week following Monday’s game. The time off is necessary for a Patriots’ offensive line dealing with injuries, including losing two starters to injured reserve earlier this week.

The Giants enter the week following a 34-27 loss to the Detroit Lions. Following another late game collapse, Defensive Coordinator Shane Bowen was fired by interim Head Coach Mike Kafka. Bowen’s issues went well beyond the loss to the Lions. The Giants have lost five games this season in which they held a lead of at least 10 points. They have also given up a league-high 133 points in the fourth quarter.

The Patriots’ ninth straight win was last week in Cincinnati. Maye, the second-year signal caller for New England, led the Pats to a 26-20 win throwing for 294 yards and a touchdown.

Inside linebacker Patrick Queen suffered a hip injury late in the second quarter of the 26-7 defeat. Initially announced by the team as questionable to return, early in the third quarter the Steelers announced that Queen would miss the rest of the game.

“He wasn’t able to run,” coach Mike Tomlin said, “so he wasn’t allowed to come back into the game.”

Pierre made his third consecutive start at outside cornerback in place of veteran Darius Slay. Slay suffered a concussion during a Nov. 9 loss at the Los Angeles Chargers and missed the following game. When he returned last week, Pierre started in his place. For Sunday’s game, Slay was inactive.

Making his Steelers debut, Asante Samuel stepped in for Pierre against Buffalo. A five-year NFL starter who had offseason neck surgery, Samuel was signed to the Steelers’ practice squad Nov. 12.

He then went to the locker room with trainers and missed nine plays while a hard cast and glove were applied to his left hand.

""He is [still in the protocol] as of right now, but we'll see how he does tomorrow,"" O'Connell said.
""Our goal is he clears, and he can have a good week of practice and have an opportunity to play next week.""

J.J. McCarthy could be cleared from the concussion protocol as soon as Monday, coach Kevin O'Connell said Sunday, and he would be in line to start the Vikings' Week 14 game against the Washington Commanders.

""He is [still in the protocol] as of right now, but we'll see how he does tomorrow,"" O'Connell said. ""Our goal is he clears, and he can have a good week of practice and have an opportunity to play next week.""

On Sunday, rookie Max Brosmer threw four interceptions in Minnesota's 26-0 loss to the Seattle Seahawks -- the first time the Vikings have been shut out since Week 17 of the 2007 season. Their 305-game streak since then, including the regular season and playoffs, was the third-longest active streak in the NFL.

McCarthy has not played much better. In six starts, he has produced the NFL's worst QBR (24.7) among 33 quarterbacks who have started at least six games. But with a 4-8 record, and a minuscule chance to make the playoffs, the Vikings' highest organizational priority is to give McCarthy as many snaps as possible to determine whether the team can count on him to be the starter in 2026.

Some around the NFL wondered if Brosmer could give the Vikings another option, but his first NFL start was rough. It has been 18 seasons since Minnesota had a quarterback finish with four interceptions and no touchdown passes in a game.

Brosmer's day began going downhill just before halftime. With Seattle holding a 3-0 lead, O'Connell went for it on fourth-and-1 at the Seahawks' 4-yard line. O'Connell called a play-action bootleg pass that he said gave Brosmer the option of running or throwing to one of several potential reads in the flat.

The Seahawks covered it well. With defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence about to sack him, Brosmer flipped an underhand throw toward tight end Josh Oliver that was intercepted by linebacker Ernest Jones IV and returned 85 yards for a touchdown.

O'Connell put the ball in Brosmer's hands on that play, he said, because Minnesota had struggled to run the ball. At that point, Vikings running backs had carried five times for 9 rushing yards.

""We wanted to try to see if we could get Max out on the perimeter with a run-pass option,"" O'Connell said, ""and ended up having a looping player in his face right away.""

In retrospect, Brosmer said he should have taken a sack. He had impressed the Vikings during training camp with his quick processing and decision-making, but O'Connell said he appeared to be processing through his reads too quickly Sunday.

Brosmer completed 19 of 30 passes for 126 yards Sunday. He completed only 1 of 9 passes that traveled 10 or more yards past the line of scrimmage.

""He was just a little sped up like a normal young player could be in his first start,"" O'Connell said, ""and then we just never could really make that one or two or three [plays] in a row.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1201%2Fr1583123_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 00:58:35.381383

What the Steelers haven’t been is consistent, and as December begins, it’s fair to wonder if consistency is ever coming.","PITTSBURGH (AP) — Aaron Rodgers hopes his bloodied nose isn’t broken. The reeling Pittsburgh Steelers feel the same way about their season.

The four-time MVP’s fractured left wrist turned out to be far from Pittsburgh’s biggest problem in a 26-7 loss to Buffalo on Sunday that dropped the Steelers back into a tie with Baltimore atop the AFC North.

The 41-year-old Rodgers took a big hit from Bills edge rusher Joey Bosa on the first play of the second half. Bosa drilled the future Hall of Famer into the Acrisure Stadium turf, the ball popped free and Christian Benford scooped it up for a momentum-swinging score.

Rodgers laid face down for several moments before jogging to the sideline. He sat out a series while getting patched up in the medical tent and returned with tape and splotches of blood on his nose.

It wasn’t pretty. Fitting for a group that has looked the part of a first-place team in name only for the better part of two months. The Steelers (6-6) have dropped five of seven, with three of the setbacks coming by 10 points or more at the hands of teams in the playoff mix.

“We’ve got to flush this one,” Rodgers said.

If they want to salvage a season that is threatening to spin out of control, they don’t have much of a choice.

Rodgers, playing exclusively out of the shotgun or pistol to protect his injured wrist, completed 10 of 21 passes for 117 yards, most of them in garbage time.

“We just didn’t have a lot of positive plays,” Rodgers said. “I felt good enough to be out there. ... Disappointed in my performance. Disappointed in the offensive performance.”

Pittsburgh managed just 166 yards, its third-lowest total in coach Mike Tomlin’s 19 years. Yet the offense was just one of the Steelers’ many issues.

A defense that knew the Bills and reigning MVP Josh Allen would challenge it on the ground wilted repeatedly.

Buffalo rolled up 249 yards rushing, the most by a visitor at Acrisure Stadium since it opened in 2001. James Cook ran for 144 yards, and Allen mashed his way into the end zone for an 8-yard score early in the fourth quarter that put the game out of reach.

The Bills controlled the ball for nearly 42 minutes and snapped the ball 74 times, nearly double that of the Steelers (40).

“It was (a butt) kicking in all areas,” linebacker T.J. Watt said.

Perhaps just as concerning is the way the Steelers lost their composure. Cam Heyward, a seven-time Pro Bowler and fixture in the locker room for 15 years, was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct in the third quarter when he responded to what he described as Allen kneeing him in the stomach.

“Just jawing back and forth and ticked off the entire game because as a quarterback you’re getting protected, but I’m not,” Heyward said. “It just (ticks) me off.”

There’s plenty to get riled up about. While Pittsburgh still controls its playoff destiny, it also faces a closing five-game stretch that includes two meetings with the run-heavy Ravens and a visit to Detroit.

Tomlin believes his team can find the answers it needs over the next month. Yet the reality is the Steelers have been unable to consistently get stops all season when they can’t produce turnovers.

Pittsburgh had two takeaways in the first half to mask the fact that it was outgained by a more than 2-to-1 margin. Buffalo did a better job protecting the ball in the second half, and the Steelers yielded.

The fans grew so restless that they chanted “Fire Tomlin!” during the second half. While Tomlin didn’t acknowledge hearing it, the longest-tenured coach in major North American professional sports was not surprised.

“I share their frustration tonight,” Tomlin said. “We didn’t do enough.”

Tomlin said he’s “looking at everything” in terms of solutions, though Pittsburgh has been mostly healthy. What the Steelers haven’t been is consistent, and as December begins, it’s fair to wonder if consistency is ever coming.

“Players need to take accountability, myself included,” Rodgers said. “And I will.”

""He had a break in the back of the hand. He's going to have a procedure done [Monday] on it,"" Harbaugh said.

Both Harbaugh and Herbert said it's unclear of the quarterback will miss any time going forward. The Chargers next game is a Week 14 primetime date with the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday Night Football.

Herbert said both he and the Chargers medical staff are hopeful that he won't have to miss any games.

""I'm treating it as if I'm playing on Monday,"" Herbert said. ""I think they were very hopeful for that. I think that's something that we'll see [Monday] and we'll get a feel for. I think they were very hopeful so that's always a good thing.""

Harbaugh said: ""We'll see where the week takes us.""

The Chargers Head Coach later added: ""He's as tough as they come. Taped it up, glove and played a great game.""

Trey Lance led the Chargers next offensive series but Herbert returned to the game a few minutes into the second quarter and promptly threw a 10-yard pass to Keenan Allen to move the chains on third down.

""They just put a hard cast on it, put a glove around it. I think that was basically it,"" Herbert said about how he returned to the game.

Herbert stayed in for the rest of the game but he did not line up under center, instead staying in shotgun and pistol formations to avoid any snaps near the line of scrimmage.

Herbert said postgame that Lance was ready to come in if the Bolts got into possible goal line formations.

""It was more so just about ball security and understanding if we don't have to go under center, there's no need for it,"" Herbert said. ""We were ready in four minute if we were, if we were going to go in goal line or anything like that Trey was ready to go. I think it's just something we'll monitor as the week goes on.""

Harbaugh added: ""Getting under center, felt that would be difficult. We're operating exclusively out of the shotgun.""

Herbert said the most difficult part of playing with the cast was holding onto the ball.

""Ball security is at a paramount. I think I did a good enough job of that today in the pocket just giving the ball to the running backs. It's just stuff to work on,"" Herbert said.

With five games left, the Chargers sit at 8-4 and occupy the No. 5 seed in the AFC playoff picture.

Herbert has played through injuries before, including a broken finger on his left hand during the 2023 season.

""I think in terms of experience, I've gone through similar things,"" Herbert said. ""I think that will be helpful.

That left Jones to navigate a tricky situation as he tried to fend off numerous rushers without escaping the pocket in a game the Colts lost 20-16. He made the best of things, completing 14 of 27 pass attempts for 201 yards. Jones also connected for two touchdown passes, including an impressive 19-yard strike to receiver Alec Pierce against two defenders.

But for Jones, who is expected to be dealing with the injury for the foreseeable future, it wasn't easy and it wasn't enough. The Colts' point total was a season low, and their 281 total yards was their second lowest of the season (second only to last week's 255 in a game Jones also played hurt).

The Texans pressured Jones on 64% of his dropbacks, and his effectiveness dropped significantly when under duress. Jones completed 2 of 11 passes when under pressure. And his 1.3 yards per attempt on those plays was the second lowest of his career, according to ESPN Research.

Jones reportedly has a fibula injury but wouldn't confirm nor deny that on Sunday.

""I feel good enough to play,"" he said. ""Doctors cleared me to play, so that's what I'm going to do.""

The Texans continued a recent trend of Colts opponents sending extra rushers and blitzing Jones, an area where he exceled earlier in the season when the Colts established themselves as the most explosive offense in the league. This highlighted the limitations of his injury, which are most obvious when it comes to Jones' reluctance to leave the pocket.

He had just one pass attempt outside the pocket Sunday, according to ESPN Research. Jones also never scrambled despite the constant pass rush, suggesting an inability to escape related to his injury.

But given Anthony Richardson Sr.'s earlier facial fracture (he remains on injured reserve) and the inexperience of rookie backup Riley Leonard, the Colts have given no consideration to a quarterback change.

""We knew that he's tough and [about] the decision to keep playing,"" receiver Michael Pittman Jr. said of Jones. ""So, we've just got to keep going.""

Jones will have to dig deep because the stakes are high. After losing three of their past four games and falling into a tie with Jacksonville for the AFC South lead, the Colts find themselves in an urgent situation. They were 7-1 just a month ago and now are in a fight down the stretch.

""I definitely expect a high sense of urgency and guys being ready, eager to correct what we need to correct,"" Jones said.

Biggest NFL Week 13 Injuries:

Woody Marks Injury Update

Texans RB Woody Marks injured his foot on his third carry of the game and was sent to the locker room.

The rookie has become Houston's lead back in recent weeks, getting the start and playing over 60 percent of the snaps in each of the last three games.

Marks returned to the game early in the second quarter after receiving some medical attention.

Sauce Gardner Injury Update

Colts CB Sauce Gardner exited in the first quarter on Sunday due to a calf injury.

Gardner seemed to pull his muscle on a running play and was quickly ruled out by the team.

With Gardner out, Mekhi Blackmon is back on the field at outside cornerback. He's made seven starts this season, but has played sparingly in recent weeks.

Amon-Ra St. Brown Injury Update

Lions WR Amon-Ra St. Brown is considered week-to-week after he suffered a low-ankle sprain on Thanksgiving against the Packers.

The Lions will play Dallas on Thursday this week, but then have a 10-day break before they head to Los Angeles and play the Rams.

If St. Brown's injury isn't too serious, his return against the Rams isn't out of the question.

Gardner would exit the Colts' Week 13 matchup with the Houston Texans on the second play of the game.

After going to the blue medical tent, Garnder was helped to the locker room, and then ruled out by the Colts a short while later.

According to Pelissero, Gardner is believed to have suffered a calf strain. Peliserro adds that these injuries ""can be tricky"" and there will be additional tests completed.

There is, however, optimism that Gardner avoided major injury as his Achilles appears to be intact.

After Gardner was ruled out, The Athletic's James Boyd saw Gardner on the Colts' sideline with a boot on his lower left leg/foot.

In Gardner's first two games with the Colts, he has allowed five receptions on 10 targets for 38 yards with two pass breakups. He's also made 12 tackles.

Gardner, the star acquired early this month from the Jets, had to be helped off the field Sunday with what the Colts called a calf injury while playing in his third game with his new team.

He has since been ruled out.

Early in the first quarter against the Texans, Gardner was blanketing tight end Cade Stover before coming up lame and hobbling away from the play. He was down on the field for a short while before getting to his feet and attempting to walk off the field.

Gardner could not make it to the sideline, instead putting his arms around trainers and helped off the field without putting pressure on his left leg. There was no immediate news regarding the severity of the injury.

In his fourth year in the league, Gardner has been playing in his first games with a quality team, the now 8-3 Colts, seeing the standout cornerback as a missing piece for their defense.

Gardner — signed to a four-year, $120.4 million deal in July — was shipped to Indianapolis for first-round picks in 2026 and 2027 and receiver Adonai Mitchell.

The Texans struck first in the opening quarter, 3-0.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-m6h2p2e82-1764527812267.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1764509915&w=1200,N,,2025-11-30 18:00:26.363291

With winter in full swing, conditions are going to be tough at Huntington Bank Field.

Weather forecasters are calling for morning rain to change over to snow showers in the afternoon near game time.

Temperatures will top out around 38 degrees and winds will be swirling up to 35 miles per hour.

In this type of environment, I’m not expecting the Browns to put the ball into the hands of Shedeur Sanders a ton in his second career NFL start.

Instead, I’m looking for Quinshon Judkins to get a ton of handoffs as Cleveland looks to protect the ball.

Judkins hasn’t been as explosive of late as he was during his first few career games earlier this season, but he gets a good matchup against injury-depleted 49ers defense.

Over their past three games, San Francisco has allowed 373 total yards per game, which is the 7th-most in football over that stretch.

In recent weeks, the Browns have also begun utilizing Judkins in the wildcat formation, giving the rookie running back even more opportunities for looks.

Veteran ball carrier Jerome Ford will miss the game with a hamstring injury, leaving the backfield for Judkins and fellow rookie Dylan Sampson.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The big development to watch for the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday is how Ahkello Witherspoon works back into a cornerback room that has surged without him. The top option coming into the season, Witherspoon has missed the past nine games, and in that time, the room around him went from a major concern to the stars of the defense. Emmanuel Forbes Jr. and Cobie Durant have combined for five interceptions over the past four games, and Darious Williams has been a steady rotational presence.

But the Rams do have to replace Quentin Lake, who rotated from nickel cornerback to strong safety to free safety but will now be out until the postseason. Durant could be an option to play inside, where Los Angeles also likes to play Josh Wallace. Roger McCreary was supposed to help here but just went on injured reserve this week.

The Rams have held four of the past six opponents to 10 points or fewer and have six interceptions across the past two games. But the tests will continue to add up, including Sunday against the Carolina Panthers and breakout rookie receiver Tetairoa McMillan.

Down in the AFC South, victory over the 1-10 Titans will give Jacksonville (7-4) an 81 percent chance of reaching the playoffs; lose and that plummets to 62 percent.

The Jags excel at two things - stopping the run and turning the ball over. They have allowed only 922 yards rushing this season (83.6 yards per game, first in the NFL), while Trevor Lawrence is fresh off tossing three touchdowns and three interceptions in the narrow overtime win in Arizona.

With head coach Liam Coen encouraging Lawrence to “let it rip”, Brian Thomas Jr returns to an offense that has averaged 30.3 points since their Week 8 bye. The Jags’ ground game is not to be underestimated either - Travis Etienne needs 25 scrimmage yards to top 1,000 yards this season.

Despite the stats, this is no gimme. The Titans have lost their last three games by a combined 16 points, Jeffery Simmons can wreck any game and Cam Ward can use his feet as well as his arm. But Tennessee are the least productive rushing offense (822 yards; 77.5 per game) and a serious team would put them away. We shall see if Jacksonville can take a step towards that today.

Jaguars inactives:

WR Dyami Brown

RB Cody Schrader

DE Travon Walker

OL Chuma Edoga

LB Yasir Abdullah

OL Patrick Mekari

TE Hunter Long

DT Arik Armstead

Atlanta’s Kyle Pitts is worth watching the rest of the season, not just today. The fifth-year tight end is 13th among tight ends this year with 459 receiving yards and he only has one touchdown. His EPA per target (minus-.09) is 33rd among tight ends this season, and he’s had critical drops in the last month.

The Falcons coaching staff continues to publicly support Pitts. “I think Kyle is having a good year. He’s playing hard,” offensive coordinator Zac Robinson said. “He’s blocking really well at the line of scrimmage. Of course, you want to get the drops off tape. He’s just got to stay confident.” However, Pitts, the No. 4 pick in the 2021 draft, is playing on the final year of his contract and he needs to show more down the stretch if he’s going to get the kind of second contract he likely is expecting.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/DryfUFSYYRg1_92Z5Geu2ZjSA_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-11-30 14:02:08.567226

49ers at Browns (1 p.m.
Giants at Patriots (8:15 p.m.","Quarterback injuries are again a key factor in NFL betting for Week 13, with some star signal-callers ruled out, others returning to action and one important starter on a playoff-caliber team deemed questionable to suit up. Here, we break down the most important NFL injuries that bettors need to know and what NFL betting lines look like per the latest SportsLine consensus odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.

Saints at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee, out)

NO WR Chris Olave (back, available)

A struggling Saints team that's starting a rookie quarterback will be very shorthanded here against the Dolphins with star running back Alvin Kamara ruled out. However, Olave is good to go.

The Dolphins are favored by 5.5 points, while the total is 41.5.

Texans at Colts (1 p.m. ET)

HOU QB C.J. Stroud (concussion, will play)

IND QB Daniel Jones (fibula, will play)

Both teams will have their starting quarterbacks, which is good news for this AFC South tilt. C.J. Stroud has missed the last three weeks with a concussion, while it was reported this week that Daniel Jones is playing through a fracture in his leg. Jones' mobility against an elite Texans defense will be worth keeping a close eye on.

Indy is a 3.5-point favorite. The total is 44.5.

Falcons at Jets (1 p.m. ET)

ATL WR Drake London (knee, out)

The Falcons' season is in a rough spot and only got worse with the recent injury to quarterback Michael Penix Jr. Kirk Cousins will start the rest of the way for Atlanta, and at least for this matchup with the Jets, he won't have top receiver Drake London, who again has been ruled out with a knee injury.

The Falcons are 2.5-point favorites, and the total is 39.5.

49ers at Browns (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Neither team has any major injuries of note here. Christian McCaffrey missed practice Wednesday and Thursday, but those were veteran rest days after heavy usage on Monday.

The 49ers are favored by 4.5 points, and the total is just 36.5.

Rams at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)

CAR CB Jaycee Horn (concussion, out)

The main injury of note here comes on the Carolina defense with star cornerback Jaycee Horn out with a concussion. The Rams have an elite offense with arguably the best receiver duo in the NFL in Puka Nacua and Davante Adams, so Horn's absence is a big one for this matchup.

The Rams are 10.5-point favorites on the road. The total is 45.

Jaguars at Titans (1 p.m. ET)

JAX WR Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle, will play)

TENN TE Chig Okonkwo (foot, available)

The Jags' offense will get a key weapon back here with the return of Brian Thomas Jr., who missed the last three weeks with an ankle injury. Thomas has had a disappointing Year 2 after a monster rookie season, so the Jaguars will hope to get him more involved over the last few weeks of the season. Tennessee tight end Chig Okonkwo is in.

Jacksonville is a 6-point favorite on the road. The total is 41.5.

Cardinals at Buccaneers (1 p.m. ET)

AZ RB Trey Benson (ankle, out)

AZ RB Emari Demercado (ankle, out)

AZ RB Bam Knight (knee, available)

AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (illness, available)

TB QB Baker Mayfield (left shoulder, available)

TB RB Bucky Irving (foot and shoulder, available)

This game features the most injury news of the weekend, but everyone who was listed as questionable is set to play. Baker Mayfield will be suiting for the Bucs, as will Bucky Irving. The running back makes his long-awaited return. For the Cardinals, Harrison Jr. and Knight are both good to go.

Tampa is a 3.5-point favorite. The total is 44.5.

Vikings at Seahawks (4:05 p.m. ET)

MINN QB J.J. McCarthy (concussion, out)

J.J. McCarthy has had an abysmal start to his playing career, and he'll be out once again, this time with a concussion. The Vikings will turn to Max Brosmer, an undrafted rookie from Minnesota. Brosmer will have good weapons to turn to, but the Vikings have listed two starting offensive linemen as questionable against a tough Seattle defense.

The Seahawks are favored by 11.5 points, and the total is 41.

Bills at Steelers (4:25 p.m. ET)

BUFF TE Dalton Kincaid (hamstring, questionable)

BUFF OTs Dion Dawkins and Spencer Brown (both out)

PITT QB Aaron Rodgers (left wrist, will play)

PITT WR DK Metcalf (ankle, will play)

The Steelers get a boost this week with the return of quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who missed last week's loss to Chicago with a fractured left wrist. The veteran signal-caller is good to go in this tough bout with the Bills, and he'll have star receiver DK Metcalf, who missed practice earlier this week with an ankle injury. The Bills are hoping to get tight end Dalton Kincaid back as he's missed the last few weeks, but their O-line will be missing two key starters against a tough Steelers front.

Buffalo is a 3-point favorite. The total is 45.5.

Raiders at Chargers (4:25 p.m. ET)

L.A. RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, out)

The Chargers will have to wait at least one more week to get dynamic running back Omarion Hampton back in the mix as the rookie is out after returning to practice this week. With Hampton out, Kimani Vidal will again serve as L.A.'s lead back against a struggling Vegas defense.

The Chargers are favored by 9,5 points against the Raiders while the total is 40.5.

Broncos at Commanders (8:20 p.m. ET)

WASH QB Jayden Daniels (left elbow, out)

WASH WR Terry McLaurin (quad, will play)

Jayden Daniels isn't yet ready to return after an ugly left elbow injury a few weeks ago, but Washington will finally have Terry McLaurin back and catching passes after a lengthy quad injury. Marcus Mariota will start under center against a Broncos team that has the No. 3 scoring defense in the NFL.

Denver is favored by 5.5 points, and the total is 43.5.

Giants at Patriots (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

NYG QB Jaxson Dart (concussion, will play)

The Pats will have a depleted offensive line after losing left tackle Will Campbell for a few weeks as he's on IR, and the team will likely be without starting guard Jared Wilson as well. The Giants will have rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart back after missing two weeks with a concussion, which paved the way for Jameis Winston to start. This will be Dart's first start under interim head coach Mike Kafka.

New England is favored by 7.5 points. The total is 46.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/11/20/5da1615d-9ae6-46d8-869b-bd3efd8a8ee5/thumbnail/1200x675/7e848c005afad0857c4ff054e44622ad/baker.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 14:02:15.103915

Adams now has 13 touchdowns in 12 games this season, having scored in six straight games.","It's been an injury-riddled season for Bucs WR Chris Godwin Jr., but he's finally starting to look like himself again here in Week 13.

He's had two big-time chunk gains in the first half, including a 25-yard reception on Tampa's opening drive, followed by a 35-yard gain in the second quarter to set them up inside the Cardinals' 10-yard line.

Unfortunately, his strong drive ended with a brutal drop in the end zone, which would have been good for his first touchdown reception of the season. He currently leads the team with 56 receiving yards after entering the week with just 61 receiving yards over three games.

Slow first quarter in Indianapolis with the Colts trailing the Texans, 3-0. Colts quarterback Daniel Jones was 1 of 5 in the first quarter for two passing yards. Jonathan Taylor rushed for 23 yards on four carries.

Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud completed 6 of 10 passes for 82 yards. Running back Woody Marks left the game with a foot injury. No word yet on whether he'll retur

Just two pass attempts after being picked off in the end zone, Matthew Stafford threw his second interception of the day. This time, it was a pick 6!

It was Stafford's first pick 6 since Week 8 of the 2023 season.

With the successful PAT, the Panthers take a 14-7 lead over the Rams closing out first quarter.

The Vikings are down to their third-string quarterback, as starter J.J. McCarthy is out with a concussion in Week 13 and his backup, veteran Carson Wentz, is out for the year with a shoulder injury.

The next man up is UDFA rookie quarterback Max Brosmer, who's slated to make his first career start for Minnesota against the Seahawks.

Brosmer started his collegiate career in the FCS, playing four seasons with the New Hampshire Wildcats. He eventually made his way to the FBS for his final season, starting 13 games for Minnesota, passing for 2,828 yards, 18 touchdowns and 6 interceptions.

McCarthy has struggled in his first season as a starter after missing all of his rookie season with a knee injury, so it remains to be seen how much of a downgrade Brosmer will actually be for the offense. McCarthy has thrown an interception in each of his six starts this season, having thrown two interceptions in four of his last five games.

He's completing just 54.1% of pass attempts with 929 yards, 6 touchdowns and 10 interceptions on the year.

Plenty of action so far in Carolina!

After the Rams scored on their opening possession, Bryce Young & Co. answered with a touchdown of their own. It was a 69-yard drive, punctuated with a 35-yard catch and run from RB Chuba Hubbard.

Chuba Hubbard played five snaps on the opening drive to Rico Dowdle's four, appearing to regain some ground in the race for snaps after a breakout run from Rico Dowdle earlier this season.

Stop me if you've heard this one before:

Matthew Stafford has thrown a touchdown pass to, who else, but Davante Adams. He's now thrown 28 consecutive touchdowns without an interception, setting a new NFL record, Ari Meirov shares.

Buffalo (7-4) and Pittsburgh (6-5) need wins to keep pace in a tight AFC playoff race. The Bills are playing second fiddle for the first time in years to the New England Patriots in the AFC East, while Pittsburgh sits tied atop the AFC North with Baltimore. The Bills lost in Houston last week and have dropped two of their last three games. The Steelers have lost four of their last six games after getting off to a 4-1 start. Aaron Rodgers should be back under center after missing Week 12 with a fractured left wrist. For two teams who've recently fallen backward in the playoff race, this game doesn't get much bigger.

However, he subsequently made steady progress in his recovery and was able to practice fully on Friday. He is not among the Buccaneers' inactives on Sunday and is expected to start against the Arizona Cardinals.

Mayfield will spend some time on Sunday afternoon handing off to second-year running back Bucky Irving, who is back in action after missing the Bucs' last seven games due to shoulder and foot injuries. Mayfield and Irving were two of six players listed as questionable on the Buccaneers' Friday injury report, but all six have been cleared to play. Starting left guard Ben Bredeson is back after missing two games with a hamstring injury; cornerback Jamel Dean will end up missing just one game with a hip injury; outside linebacker Haason Reddick is back after sitting out four contests with ankle and knee issues; and outside linebacker Anthony Nelson has overcome a ribs injury suffered last weekend.

The Buccaneers and Cardinals submitted their list of inactives at 11:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, 90 minutes before the scheduled kickoff of their Week 13 meeting at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. The Buccaneers elevated safety Marcus Banks from their practice squad for the game and thus had to name six inactives to get down to the game-day limit of 48. The Cardinals elevated tight end Pharaoh Brown and linebacker Channing Tindall from the practice squad to give them 54 available players, which meant they had to name six players inactive on Sunday.

Arizona had a lengthy injury list this week and ruled out six players on Friday, though two – running back Trey Benson and offensive lineman Christian Jones – are technically still on injured reserve. Another Cardinals running back, Emari Demercado, will be sidelined for the game due to an ankle injury; he leads the team this season with 241 rushing yards. Arizona's starting right guard, Will Hernandez, is also unavailable due to hip and knee ailments, and he was placed on injured reserve on Saturday.

The fallout from both of those situations will have a direct impact on Sunday's matchup between the Darnold-less Vikings and Darnold-led Seahawks.

On back-to-back fourth-quarter plays last week in Green Bay, McCarthy had his head slam into the ground -- the first when he was tackled by Packers linebacker Isaiah McDuffie, and then on the next play when he was chased and tackled by Green Bay defensive end Kingsley Enagbare.

McCarthy self-reported his symptoms on the flight back to Minnesota from Green Bay, and then found himself in concussion protocol, where he now remains, sources told ESPN.

With McCarthy out, the Vikings will start undrafted rookie quarterback Max Brosmer, who starred last season at the University of Minnesota.

And just like that, the Vikings find themselves in the type of challenging situation they were hoping to avoid this past offseason, when two of their quarterbacks -- Darnold and Daniel Jones -- were about to become free agents.

The Vikings made a passing attempt to re-sign Darnold, but they were not as aggressive as the Seahawks or Steelers. The Seahawks offered Darnold more money, and more years, than Minnesota. Seattle's offer was evidence that it wanted and valued Darnold more than Minnesota, and the Seahawks landed their new starting quarterback just days after trading former starting quarterback Geno Smith to the Raiders.

Darnold -- the son of a plumber and a teacher -- has flourished in Seattle.

McCarthy, on the other hand, has battled through another injury-plagued season -- first suffering a high-ankle sprain in Week 2 that prevented him from playing until recently, and now the concussion that will knock him out of at least Sunday's game.

The Vikings now will turn to Brosmer, whom they have eyed since last year. He first caught the eye of Vikings officials at the University of Minnesota's pro day in March 2024, right after he transferred into the program from the University of New Hampshire. Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell and general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah both attended that day and were impressed.

Golden Gophers coach P.J. Fleck later advocated for Brosmer with Adofo-Mensah, who lobbied to get the young quarterback an invitation to the NFL scouting combine in February. Adofo-Mensah lobbied for Brosmer even though the Vikings, who entered the 2025 draft with only four selections, did not have a great chance to draft him.

A few weeks later at the Gophers' 2025 pro day, the Vikings GM was overheard saying that he ""kind of wish[ed]"" he hadn't lobbied for Brosmer to the combine ""because then he'd really be our secret.""

Brosmer ultimately did not get drafted, but the Vikings were the team that was the most aggressive about signing him. He will become the first quarterback to make his first career start for an NFL team in the same state where he played college football since Joshua Dobbs, who played at the University of Tennessee and made his first start for the Titans in 2022.

Brosmer also attended the same high school as Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald -- Centennial High School in Roswell, Georgia.

So the Vikings lost Darnold but got Brosmer -- and now will have the chance to see both quarterbacks square off Sunday in Seattle.",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1030%2Fr1568359_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-30 12:01:55.284834

""Unfortunately, during the routine meeting with our medical team, Frank failed his physical.
Lions coach Dan Campbell said he's not sure if Ragnow will continue his comeback attempt in 2026 and beyond.
Ragnow, 29, had two season left on his contract, this year and next, when he retired abruptly in June.
""That was never discussed,"" Campbell said in a Zoom with Detroit reporters that was scheduled before Ragnow underwent his physical.","Frank Ragnow's comeback is over.

The Detroit Lions announced that Ragnow failed a physical with the team Friday, Nov. 29, two days after they removed him from the reserved/retired list in hopes of getting a boost for the playoffs.

Ragnow had a Grade 3 hamstring strain, the Lions said in a statement.

""Frank Ragnow reported to our facility yesterday and went through the normal process of meetings,"" the statement read. ""Unfortunately, during the routine meeting with our medical team, Frank failed his physical.

""The medical exam revealed a Grade 3 hamstring strain that will keep him from participating for the remainder of the regular season. For that reason, Frank will not be rejoining the Lions. Frank has always been a team-first guy and is a true warrior. He will forever be a Lion.""

Lions coach Dan Campbell said he's not sure if Ragnow will continue his comeback attempt in 2026 and beyond.

Ragnow, 29, had two season left on his contract, this year and next, when he retired abruptly in June. He made four Pro Bowls in seven seasons, was a three-time second-team All-Pro and battled a slew of injuries throughout his career.

""That was never discussed,"" Campbell said in a Zoom with Detroit reporters that was scheduled before Ragnow underwent his physical. ""It was just once we realized the severity of it, he did, then it just, that’s where it went. So nothing was discussed past the news that you guys just got.""

Campbell said Ragnow, who had been mulling coming out of retirement for about a month, according to left tackle Taylor Decker, disclosed to the team ""he had a little bit of"" a hamstring injury before deciding Wednesday, Nov. 26, he wanted to play this year.

Wednesday was the deadline for Ragnow to unretire and be eligible to play this season.

""We just didn’t know the severity of it until we had the final physical and all the tests that were run that we do with anybody we bring in,"" Campbell said. ""So yeah, we had an idea, we just didn’t know it was going to be that extent.""

The Lions' offense, led by one of the best lines in the NFL the past few years, has struggled in Ragnow's absence this season.

They've allowed 26 sacks in 12 games, are scoring four fewer points per game than they did last season and have dealt with injuries and communication issues at times up front.

Graham Glasgow moved from left guard to center to replace Ragnow in training camp and is one of the lowest-graded centers in the NFL, according to Pro Football Focus, and the Lions have relied primarily on first-year starters rookie Tate Ratledge and second-year pro Christian Mahogany at right and left guard.

Glasgow missed the Lions' Thanksgiving loss to the Green Bay Packers with a knee injury and Mahogany is out likely until the playoffs with a broken bone in his leg. Decker also has battled a shoulder injury all year.

Campbell said he does not know Glasgow's availability for next week's game against the Dallas Cowboys, but that Trystan Colon ""did some good things"" in his first start at center against the Packers.

""There was a little up and down, but, man, I thought he brought a lot of energy, I thought most of his ID’s were on point and I thought he did some good things,"" Campbell said. ""And I think the more he plays, the better he can get, too.""

While the Lions, losers of four of their past seven games, were counting on Ragnow to help them make a playoff push, Campbell said his loss won't be an emotional drain on the team.

""I mean, look, of course we’re disappointed just because Frank’s such a good dude and a great teammate and he’s a productive player,"" he said. ""But at the same time, he’s injured, too, and so man, you quickly move off of that and know what it is and he’s not playing and it’s all good, man. We adjust, we move on and we’re onto Dallas now, so we’ve been going.""","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/02/PDTF/83994527007-img-nfl-detroit-lions-at-1.JPG?crop=2399,1350,x0,y0&width=2399&height=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-30 13:01:20.395107

Mason Rudolph was serviceable but unspectacular versus Chicago, going 24 of 31 for 171 yards, one touchdown and one interception.
With this potentially being Rodgers final season in the NFL, he seemingly isn't content to miss another opportunity to turn things around.
Rodgers played nearly the entirety of the 2018 season with a tibial fracture after getting hurt in Week 1.
The Steelers will obviously hope to fare better, and a win against the Bills on Sunday would go a long way in doing so.","Despite the injury, Rodgers logged two full practices to end the week, after which head coach Mike Tomlin said all systems were go for Week 13. The upcoming matchup against Buffalo comes with enormous stakes. Following the Ravens' Thanksgiving loss to the Bengals, Pittsburgh has a chance to open up a game lead over Baltimore in the AFC North ahead of playing each other in Week 14, the first of two matchups between the clubs remaining this season.

Beyond the divisional aspect, a win over Buffalo would make the Steelers and Bills an identical 7-5 and give Pittsburgh a leg up if needed in the wild-card race.

It's imperative to have Rodgers out there. Through 10 games in his first season in black and gold, he's thrown for 1,969 yards, 19 touchdowns and seven interceptions with a 97.7 passer rating, his highest since 2021.

Mason Rudolph was serviceable but unspectacular versus Chicago, going 24 of 31 for 171 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He also lost a fumble.

Would Rodgers have been the difference against the Bears, whom he's tormented throughout his career? Perhaps, but his willingness to play through injury in the aftermath should certainly provide a morale boost to a team that's been spiraling of late.

After starting the season 4-1 to open up a comfortable divisional lead, the Steelers have lost four of their past six and went into Week 13 knotted at the top with the Ravens. With this potentially being Rodgers final season in the NFL, he seemingly isn't content to miss another opportunity to turn things around.

Considering his history, there's little surprise he'd push so hard to play through the pain.

Rodgers played nearly the entirety of the 2018 season with a tibial fracture after getting hurt in Week 1. He also played his final season for the Packers in 2022 with an avulsion fracture in his right thumb from Week 5 onward.

Green Bay notably missed the playoffs during both of those campaigns.

Star wide receiver Chris Godwin has played in just three games this season after briefly returning in September from last year's season-ending fibula injury. Promising young wide receiver Jalen McMillan has yet to play this year after suffering a preseason neck injury.

That's about to change.

Sources say McMillan, the second-year wideout who burst onto the scene with a stellar rookie season, is set to have his practice window opened soon. If there are no setbacks, McMillan could begin practicing this week -- setting the stage for an infusion of help for the season's stretch run.

McMillan had 37 catches for 461 yards and eight touchdowns as a rookie, and he hoped to build on that success this year. But the third-rounder from Washington suffered three vertebrae fractures in his neck during a preseason game against the Steelers on Aug. 16 and has spent the season on injured reserve.

But this past week, however, noted spine expert Dr. Robert Watkins confirmed that McMillan has received the green light to practice, sources say.

While he's been ramping up away from the spotlight, that news opens the door for him to practice with the team this week. McMillan playing in games won't be immediate, as he will need to get into playing shape, but a return is coming.

Buccaneers head coach Todd Bowles was asked this past week about the potential returns of McMillan, veteran wide receiver Mike Evans (broken clavicle) and defensive lineman Calijah Kancey (torn pectoral).

""We will have to see,"" Bowles said, ""but I think they will all be back before the season is out.""

Evans is also trending in the right direction after he broke his collarbone in a Week 7 loss to the Detroit Lions. While his return might not be this week, it could be the next. A determination on Evans' status will be based on medical scans that are coming.

As for Sunday's game against the Cardinals, Baker Mayfield is expected to play after being listed as questionable due to a sprained AC joint in his left shoulder suffered in Week 12, running back Bucky Irving is returning after dealing with shoulder and foot injuries, and guard Ben Bredeson and linebacker Haason Reddick are likely back, as well.

Plus, Godwin should play more than his handful of plays last week as he works his way back from last year's fibula fracture.

It's taken a while, but the Bucs are finally getting healthy.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/adsjekw0yaiajurlxw1s,N,,2025-11-30 13:01:25.035164

That will be good news for a Giants’ defense that desperately needs Lawrence to both play and make an impact.

Lawrence did practice on Saturday. He said he was unsure how much he will be able to play as he deals with an injury to the same elbow he dislocated a season ago, landing on injured reserve.

Defensive line coach Andre Patterson apparently was not happy with criticism he received about Lawrence’s playing time against Detroit.

Lawrence said the elbow “flared up” when he took a couple of hits during the game against Detroit.

Edge defender Kayvon Thibodeaux did not practice again on Saturday and will miss his third straight game with a shoulder injury.

“I think it’s too soon to tell,” interim head coach Mike Kafka said when asked if Thibodeaux could be shut down for the season. “He’s working his tail off to get back and get better. Our doctors are taking care of him.”

The latest evidence: the rookie tackle’s Instagram.

Campbell, who suffered an MCL sprain during last week’s road win over the Cincinnati Bengals, was placed on in-season injured reserve this week. The fourth-overall pick now must miss at least four games, meaning he’ll be eligible to return for the Week 18 home game against the Miami Dolphins.

Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel has indicated Campbell’s injury absence will be brief, and Campbell sang a similar tune on Friday with the caption for his Instagram post.

“BRB,” Campbell wrote, using shorthand for “be right back.”

The Patriots plan to start veteran Vederian Lowe at left tackle moving forward, beginning with Monday night’s home game against the New York Giants. Rookie seventh-rounder Marcus Bryant will serve as the top backup behind Lowe and right tackle Morgan Moses.

The hope, then, is for Campbell to return for Week 18 and work off any rust before the playoffs. Of course, that optimistic timeline hinges on the success of his recovery.

Mercogliano,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6847906/2025/11/29/new-york-rangers-lightning-adam-fox-injury/,"Saturday’s 4-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning was the Rangers’ ninth defeat in 11 tries on home ice this season.
They’re 2-8-1 at MSG, with five points registering as a new franchise low through their first 11 home games, according to NHL Stats.

Tampa finished with 35 shots while New York mustered only 13, marking its lowest total of the season.","NEW YORK — On a recent road trip to Tampa Bay, I walked by a pizza joint donning a sign that proudly proclaimed, “We use New York water!” But while the water up north may make for better quality dough, something about it doesn’t seem to agree with the New York Rangers.

It’s as if they get food poisoning every time they set foot in Madison Square Garden.

Saturday’s 4-1 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning was the Rangers’ ninth defeat in 11 tries on home ice this season. They’re 2-8-1 at MSG, with five points registering as a new franchise low through their first 11 home games, according to NHL Stats. But it’s about more than just the mounting losses; it’s the embarrassing manner in which they’ve unfolded in front of the loyal Garden crowd, who continue to fill the building despite the disheartening performances.

“They were more willful than we were today,” Rangers captain J.T. Miller said of the Lightning. “At no point in that game were we deserving of winning.”

The Rangers (13-12-2) were utterly lifeless out of the gate. They skated as if they were still digesting their Thanksgiving dinner, leaving key areas of the ice open and making poor decisions with the puck on the rare occasions they got to it. Tampa Bay set up shop in the offensive zone and got comfortable there for the entire afternoon, with New York offering little pushback. It led to a dominant first period, with the Lightning earning each of the game’s first nine shots on goal and 17 of the first 18 attempts.

“We got out-competed from the drop of the puck,” coach Mike Sullivan said.

Tampa finished with 35 shots while New York mustered only 13, marking its lowest total of the season. The Lightning also held a distinct 16-4 advantage in high-danger scoring chances at five-on-five, according to Natural Stat Trick.

Seven of those HD chances came in the opening 20 minutes, which could have easily resulted in a multi-goal lead if not for Igor Shesterkin. Sullivan opted to start his No. 1 goalie on back-to-back days for the first time this season, but it wasn’t enough to inspire better play from his teammates. Shesterkin bailed them out multiple times in the opening 10 minutes, but the Rangers eventually got what they deserved when an off-target shot from Lightning forward Brandon Hagel redirected in off defenseman Carson Soucy’s skate at the 10:53 mark.

That was the only goal of a lopsided first period, providing a sliver of hope that the Rangers could regroup and rally at intermission. But not much changed in the second, with Tampa generating another seven HD chances in the middle period. Hagel scored his second goal of the game after New York got caught sleeping at the 8:57 mark — first on an ill-advised dump-in from Alexis Lafrenière that abruptly ended a three-on-two rush and handed possession right back to the Lightning, then on the ensuing counter in which no one wearing blue bothered to hustle back and defend.

“I didn’t think we had dump it,” Sullivan said. “I thought we should have challenged off the rush there. We’re trying to encourage Laf to challenge people, hang onto pucks, go wide, force that guy to have to defend you. … I felt like tonight there was a fair amount of times we just gave it back to them when we didn’t have to.”

Miller cut the Rangers’ deficit to 2-1 when an Adam Fox pass went in off his skate late in the second period, but it never felt like they had a comeback in them. Nick Paul made sure of it by redirecting a feed from Nikita Kucherov to make it 3-1 Lightning 2:02 into the third before Jake Guentzel sealed the win with an empty-netter.

It was the ultimate buzzkill following a three-game winning streak, which saw New York climb its way out of the Metro Division basement, only to stumble right back into it.

“There’s got to be a willingness and a want to be first to pucks, to embrace physicality,” Sullivan said. “We knew the type of game it was going to be. That team, they’ve got hard skill, they compete and they skate. That was the kind of game that it was going to be.

“I don’t think we had the wherewithal to match their intensity. I just felt like we lost puck battles all over the rink, and it’s hard to establish any sort of game that you want to play if you don’t win puck battles.”

Making matters worse is the uncertainty surrounding Fox, who exited in pain after Hagel crunched his left arm into the boards on a clean hit with 12:57 to play and did not return. Sullivan labeled it an upper-body injury and said the 27-year-old was still being evaluated, but an absence of any kind would be damning. There’s an argument that no Ranger would be harder to replace. It’s a two-man debate between Fox and Shesterkin, with the former representing their only point-producing defenseman — he’s racked up 10 assists during his current six-game point streak — and team MVP up to this point.

“He’s a Norris (Trophy) defenseman,” said center Mika Zibanejad in an obvious-but-telling response.

The built-in excuse is that the Rangers are tied for most games played (27) by any NHL team this season, with nine coming in the last 15 days. It’s been a grueling schedule that included 16 of their first 26 games on the road, but they’re far from the only team dealing with heavy legs. The Lightning also played three times in the last four days.

Meanwhile, New York entered as close to full strength as it’s been since the beginning of the season. Defenseman Will Borgen returned to the lineup Saturday after missing the previous five games due to an upper-body injury, while Tampa was playing without three of its top-four D — Erik Černák, Victor Hedman and Ryan McDonagh — plus No. 1 center Brayden Point.

You wouldn’t have known it watching this one. The Rangers looked flat, and worse, disengaged.

“I’ve talked about it a few times, but this game’s majority mental,” Rangers center Vincent Trocheck said. “It’s up to you to kind of fight off the negativity whenever there’s something creeping into your mind.”

The hard truth is that the Rangers are decidedly mid, as the kids say today. They’re always a threat to steal a game against quality opponents thanks to Shesterkin, but it’s been a struggle to consistently hang with the league’s best. Consider that they’ve won only five of 14 games against teams that entered Saturday in playoff position, with none of those victories coming at MSG. Then consider that Saturday started a stretch of eight home games in their next 11, with the powerful Dallas Stars next up to visit the Garden on Tuesday.

Because of New York’s flawed roster, which has been exposed for its lack of playmaking and diminished team speed, it can ill afford to compound those issues by getting outworked. That became an unfortunate trademark of the 2024-25 Rangers, and while it’s been generally better under Sullivan, there have been a handful of concerning efforts just over a quarter of the way into the new season. They’ve called themselves out on those occasions, but this is an actions-speak-louder-than-words situation.

These Rangers aren’t skilled enough to get by on talent alone — and if they don’t bring the necessary level of determination, the potential lingers for ugly afternoons like this.

“That’s something obviously that I’ll discuss with my coaching staff moving forward,” Sullivan said. “Obviously, our expectation is higher. I don’t think the players, by any stretch, have intentions of getting out-competed. Obviously, we’ve got to find a way to take more pride in that, and that’s something that we’ve got to work through as a group.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/29192949/GettyImages-2249079801-scaled-e1764462619182.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-30 12:02:21.255325

For two weeks, he prepared as best he could, knowing he likely wouldn't play but wanting to be ready just in case.
After missing one game, a win against the Falcons in Week 11, Wallace was champing at the bit to be back on the field.
Wallace—who had 52 tackles, four for loss, four passes defended at the time of his injury—practiced as a full participant all week.","CHARLOTTE — For weeks now, Trevin Wallace has been rearing to get back on the field. Logically, he knew that the shoulder injury he suffered in Week 10 needed time to heal. Logically, he knew the Panthers had other players who could step in for two games. Logically, he knew he could still watch and learn from the sideline.

""I grew up in South Georgia, where if I got hurt, my dad was like, 'You ain't going to the hospital. You better walk it off,"" joked Wallace this week (while being completely serious).

""So I grew up like that. So, like, I felt like it's been games where I was, like, when I sat out, oh, I could have played. But just the professional aspect of being smart and knowing, like, 'Hey, your body is your money. So just get prepared for the next game and then see what you can do after that.'

""They really had to protect me from myself because I was telling them straight up, like I can go out there, shoulder, no shoulder, amputate it off, so I can go out there and play with one arm.""

That seemed like a slightly dramatic choice, though, so instead Wallace took his time recovering, even when he wanted to test the waters to play again. For two weeks, he prepared as best he could, knowing he likely wouldn't play but wanting to be ready just in case. It was easier, Wallace admitted, because he was forced to exit during a period of his career in which he was playing well.

That wasn't always the case, and this break allowed him to evaluate the defense and himself from a much healthier, mentally, at least, position.

""Obviously, you know I started off rough. Everybody knows that,"" blatantly stated Wallace. ""But I progressed over and over, so I felt good about myself. Now if I was playing bad and I was then (hurt), I'm like damn, I need to be out there because the tape is my resume,"" admitted Wallace.

""So after I got hurt, I was like, OK, you've been playing good. So maybe sit back a little bit and learn from the other linebackers.""

Those he was learning by watching, for the most part, were older than him. So he was able to mentally pick up on the game and the defensive scheme that can get lost in the heat of battle on the field. He also had a front row seat to something he had suspected but had not been a spectator for yet.

""We got a heck of a physical defense,"" whistled Wallace. ""Defense is real physical. I'd hate to be on the other side of the ball from them. So now we got a real physical defense. So things I already knew. Even on the sideline, seeing it for myself on the sideline, seeing in my helmet, like it felt cool a little bit, seeing like a game on the sideline instead of being in it.""

Like any true competitor, though, that reticence lasted only a short time. After missing one game, a win against the Falcons in Week 11, Wallace was champing at the bit to be back on the field.

""You want honest,"" Wallace warned, suggesting the answer might not be a canned compan line. ""But no, it was kind of frustrating. Just frustrating seeing, like I love the game of football and I ain't out there playing, so it is that aspect of just being, like, frustration. That's what it was. I was more frustrated.

""I still be watching films, so it's like knowing what team's going to hit us with or like what team's going to do, but it's like I'm calling it out, but I'm not out there to execute or help my teammates. So that's the frustration part.""

But that frustration is finally, seemingly, over. Wallace—who had 52 tackles, four for loss, four passes defended at the time of his injury—practiced as a full participant all week. Coach Dave Canales indicated he is expected to play Sunday against the Rams, just in time, with Christian Rozeboom still rehabbing a hip and hamstring injury and Claudin Cherelus remaining in concussion protocol.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/panthers/orykprhnsf9bx2gpydyy,N,,2025-11-30 12:03:02.502362

More about Cardinals’ additions ahead of Buccaneers matchup

Conner was selected by the Cardinals in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL draft out of Texas. He suffered a knee injury three plays into the opening drive in a loss to the Denver Broncos during Week 2 of the preseason and has been out since.

The Cardinals signed Brown to the practice squad in October, and he has been elevated for three games in a row. Brown has 89 games of experience over eight NFL seasons after entering the league with the then-Oakland Raiders as an undrafted rookie out of Oregon.

The wide receiver has spent time with Oakland (2017), Cleveland (2019, 2022), Houston (2020-22), New England (2023) and Seattle (2024).

The Cardinals’ Week 11 loss to the San Francisco 49ers was Brown’s first game with Arizona, where he was called for a holding penalty which nullified Bam Knight’s 60-yard touchdown.

Tindall was signed to the practice squad in September and made his Cardinals debut last week, playing exclusively on special teams. He had 16 tackles over 44 games with the Miami Dolphins (2022-24).

The Cardinals still have 52 on their active roster after releasing linebacker Xavier Thomas on Friday.

Zavala originally went on IR in Week 5 with a knee injury, but was activated and started three more games before leaving Monday's loss to the 49ers.

His second trip to IR this year is the fifth for a Panthers offensive lineman this year. Robert Hunt (torn biceps) and Austin Corbett (MCL) were placed on IR after Week 2, and Brady Christensen (Achilles) in Week 9.

Corbett was activated in Week 7 and has played the last six weeks (starting four), and they're leaving the door open for Hunt to return after the bye week. Players could conceivably return from IR twice, but they'd count both times against the eight-player limit.

They've activated four from IR so far, with LaBryan Ray and Jalen Coker coming back, along with Zavala and Corbett.

King was a seventh-round pick of the Packers in 2024 out of Penn State and spent the year on their practice squad. After he was released this year in cuts to the 53, the Panthers signed him to their practice squad on Aug. 28.

He helps bolster a secondary that lost rookie cornerback Corey Thornton for the season to a broken fibula, and Jaycee Horn to a concussion during the 49ers game. Horn has been ruled out this week.

The Panthers are going to start their 10th different line in 13 games this season (with Jake Curhan replacing Zavala at right guard), and Charles will be the eighth active lineman along with Nick Samac and Yosh Nijman.

Simmons offers an experienced body on defense and special teams. The former No. 8 overall pick in the 2020 draft (one spot after Derrick Brown) has played in 84 games with 42 starts during his time with the Cardinals, Giants, and Packers.

We’ve lost, what, six in a row?
This marks Milwaukee’s longest losing streak since the Bucks lost eight in a row in January 2014, when Antetokounmpo was an NBA rookie.
“We’ve gotta get into the mindset that we’ve gotta compete,” he said.
We’ve gotta find open 3s; we’ve gotta run, we gotta create spacing.","NEW YORK — For the first time since Nov. 17, Giannis Antetokounmpo suited up for the Milwaukee Bucks after battling a left adductor strain that sidelined him for four games. The two-time NBA MVP finished with 30 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists on a minutes restriction limiting him to only 28 minutes, but the Bucks lost 118-109 to the New York Knicks.

While Antetokounmpo played well in his return, the Bucks (8-12) are on a seven-game losing streak, having lost two games with Antetokounmpo before his absence, four straight games without Antetokounmpo and now a close game in New York.

Friday’s loss also kept Milwaukee, last year’s NBA Cup champions, from advancing to the quarterfinals for the first time in the three-year history of the NBA’s in-season tournament.

“Does it matter what I’ve seen (when I was sidelined with the injury)? It doesn’t matter — it happened,” Antetokounmpo said, when asked to assess what he saw from the bench while he was out for the last four games. “We’ve lost the games. We’ve lost, what, six in a row? Seven in a row?”

To close the game, not doing the little things ultimately sank the Bucks’ chances of a comeback victory in Madison Square Garden. With a little more than five minutes remaining, a baseline spin and dunk from Antetokounmpo brought the Bucks within two points of the Knicks, but mistakes piled up down the stretch.

Out of a timeout, Doc Rivers drew up a play for Kyle Kuzma to take advantage of a size mismatch on Jalen Brunson, and he did successfully, drawing a foul to go to the line. But Kuzma missed both free throws. On the next offensive possession, Myles Turner (10 points) had a catch-and-shoot 3-pointer from Antetokounmpo that could have tied the game, but it bounced in and out.

Then Antetokounmpo was called for a foul on a 3-point attempt by Jalen Brunson.

Rivers challenged the call, but it was deemed unsuccessful, and Brunson went to the line for three free throws. On the night, Brunson put up 37 points (12 of 21 from the field, 9 of 10 on free throws) and five assists.

Kuzma, who had 20 points on 8-of-9 shooting, buried a 3 on the next possession to bring the Bucks within two again, but Milwaukee blew a defensive coverage on the next possession.

Rather than letting Antetokounmpo handle Josh Hart rolling down the lane, point guard Ryan Rollins crashed down into the paint and left Miles McBride open in the corner.

Antetokounmpo got to the paint for an easy look at the rim on the next offensive possession to shrink the Knicks’ lead down to three, but then the Bucks made another mistake on the defensive end. While Rollins let Antetokounmpo handle the 2-on-1 situation against Hart, the Bucks couldn’t keep Karl-Anthony Towns from bulldozing his way into position for an offensive rebound and two more free throws.

From there, the Bucks just couldn’t score and eventually lost by nine points.

While Milwaukee failed to close out the game during clutch time, coach Doc Rivers believes little things have been piling up this season and are causing a major problem for his team.

“The bottom line is they had 13 more shots than us, they had eight more free throws,” Rivers said. “We’re outshooting teams (in accuracy). Shooting 52 percent, but it’s the turnovers, it’s the offensive rebounds, it’s the fouls.

“It’s a numbers game, and we have to win that game. Especially with Giannis, if we win that game, we’re going to win the game.”

This numbers game has been a consistent problem for the Bucks all season. In 2002, basketball analyst Dean Oliver introduced his four factors of basketball: effective field goal percentage, turnover percentage, offensive rebound percentage and free throw rate. Those four factors essentially create the numbers that Rivers spoke about following Friday’s loss.

When including the ratings of your opponents in the four factors, there are eight categories, and this season, according to Cleaning the Glass, the Bucks are elite in only one of those eight categories: effective field goal percentage.

In short, the Bucks are incredibly efficient with the shots that they take, but they create the fewest second-chance opportunities and get to the free throw line less than any other team. Conversely, they are below average at defending shots, forcing turnovers and grabbing defensive rebounds and send teams to the free throw line more often than all but three teams.

Going forward, the Bucks will need to find a way to improve upon those numbers to consistently win games, but for now, they might need to find the necessary desperation to win one game and end their current seven-game losing streak. This marks Milwaukee’s longest losing streak since the Bucks lost eight in a row in January 2014, when Antetokounmpo was an NBA rookie.

For Antetokounmpo, that starts with doing the little things at a much higher level.

“You gotta come in, do your job, do what you’re paid to do, defend, rebound the ball, do the little things,” he said in a nearly three-minute explanation. “And sometimes when you worry about doing the little things, all the other things add up.

“If you’re so concerned with scoring the ball and getting yourself going offensively, and that doesn’t work for you, now you feel like you cannot do nothing. You cannot worry about one shot or two shots that you miss, which took four seconds out of the game to dictate 47 minutes, 56 seconds of the game.”

Doing the little things is part of what Antetokounmpo described as a winning mindset, as he continued his impassioned post-game message.

“We’ve gotta get into the mindset that we’ve gotta compete,” he said. “We gotta get to the mindset that this is not a one-man show, that we have to do it together. We’ve gotta move the ball. We’ve gotta find open 3s; we’ve gotta run, we gotta create spacing.

“Overall, we gotta get our competitive spirit back to where it’s supposed to be. Nobody should have a personal agenda, nobody should worry about what they want from themselves, worry only about winning mentality. Winning mindset.

On Saturday, it was revealed that he won’t play at least for the next month.

The Steelers placed Jones on injured reserve with a neck injury, meaning he must sit out the next four games, starting with the matchup Sunday against the Buffalo Bills at Acrisure Stadium. Jones already had been ruled out for the game against Buffalo, but now he is certain to miss matchups at Baltimore, at home against Miami and at Detroit. He would be eligible to return for the final two games of the season.

Jones exited in the second half of the Steelers’ 31-28 loss in Chicago last Sunday with what the team called a stinger. He was replaced by Calvin Anderson, but coach Mike Tomlin announced Friday that another veteran, former first-round draft pick Andrus Peat, will start at left tackle against the Bills.

Jones had appeared in 45 consecutive games since the Steelers selected him in the first round of the 2023 NFL Draft. He switched to left tackle this year after spending his first two seasons at right tackle. He has made 38 career starts.

The injury comes at a critical time for Jones if it is long lasting. The Steelers must decide in the offseason whether to exercise his fifth-year option or allow him to become a free agent in 2027.

In another roster move Saturday, the Steelers elevated cornerback Asante Samuel Jr. from the practice squad. Samuel joined the Steelers’ practice squad Nov. 12. He had spinal fusion surgery in April and wasn’t cleared to play until November. A fifth-year veteran, Samuel had started 47 games for the Los Angeles Chargers before suffering a stinger last season that required surgery.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/11/9086156_web1_AP25329131919867.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 19:58:54.269507

Earlier in primetime preparations, New England sent left tackle and No. 4 overall pick Will Campbell to injured reserve along with cornerback Alex Austin.

On the other side of the aisle, the Giants will be without Thibodeaux’s pass rush for a third game in a row due to a shoulder injury.

Saturday’s in-stadium practice saw a pair of March signings return for the Patriots in a partial capacity. Questionable tags followed. Landry had been listed as sidelined on back-to-back injury reports due to a knee issue. The captain off the edge leads New England with 16 quarterback hits and is tied for the lead 6.5 sacks through a dozen starts. As for Tonga, the nose tackle, short-yardage fullback and offseason award winner suffered a chest injury last week. A season-low 12 defensive snaps were the result.

Jones suffered a neck injury during a Week 12 loss to the Chicago Bears. Because of his IR designation, the Georgia product, whom the Steelers selected No. 14 overall in the 2023 NFL Draft, won't be able to return to action until at least Week 17. At that juncture, Pittsburgh will play the Cleveland Browns on the road during its penultimate regular-season game.

Jones has been penalized just once this season, according to Pro Football Focus, which has him down for three sacks allowed since he gave up three in Week 1.

His injury against the Bears was originally reported as a stinger, per the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, but Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin ruled Jones out for Sunday's game against the Bills during his Tuesday news conference, signaling that Jones' issue was more serious.

In his absence, swing tackle Calvin Anderson got the nod at left tackle versus the Bears. Anderson blocked in front of Steelers backup quarterback Mason Rudolph, who threw for 171 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception amid the 31-28 defeat in Chicago.

Even though Anderson piled up what PFF reported as 23 offensive snaps against the Bears, he won't be starting Sunday versus the Bills. The job belongs to Andrus Peat, who beat out Anderson for the opportunity in practice this week.

""I'm always ready to play or start,"" Peat said Friday, via ESPN. ""I've been a starter most of my career, so I always try to prepare like that and keep myself in that mindset.""

The New Orleans Saints picked Peat in the first round of the 2015 draft. He spent the first nine seasons of his career with the Saints. While he mostly played left guard, he started a slew of games at left tackle for the Saints in 2023.

Earlier this season, his first in Pittsburgh, he started at left guard for the Steelers when Isaac Seumalo was injured.

Davis, who was medically cleared to play in only one of Dallas’ back-to-back games, chose the more difficult option. He wasn’t able to go in February, when the Dallas Mavericks and Lakers met in Los Angeles. He was sure he wasn’t going to sit out another game against his old team.

“You know what game I want to play,” Davis said Wednesday.

Davis tallied 12 points, five rebounds and five assists in his return from a left calf strain that sidelined him for 14 consecutive games. The Mavericks briefly held a one-point lead in the fourth quarter but couldn’t hold on to it as they lost 129-119 to a Lakers team that got big performances from Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves. The two of them combined to score 73 points on 33 shots as the Lakers improved to 3-0 against the Mavericks since the teams’ mega-trade in February, when Dallas and Los Angeles swapped Dončić for Davis.

“Any time you miss time, you have to let your body heal,” Davis said. “I felt ready.”

Actually, Davis felt ready weeks ago. He pushed to return to the lineup in a Nov. 8 game against the Washington Wizards. The Mavericks, who wanted to ensure Davis wasn’t at risk of re-injuring himself, didn’t feel comfortable putting him back out there then. Three days after the Wizards game, Dallas fired general manager Nico Harrison, who was the biggest proponent of trading for Davis.

When the Mavericks and Lakers played each other in February, there was palpable energy inside Crypto.com Arena. Harrison memorably stood at midcourt in an electric blue suit while Dončić did his pregame warmup.

With Harrison out of the picture, Friday’s game didn’t feel as intense.

The Mavericks played well but couldn’t keep up with the Lakers’ shotmaking ability. Dončić scored 35 points on 10-of-18 shooting and went a perfect 11 of 11 at the free-throw line. Reaves was even more efficient, needing only 15 shot attempts to score 38 points.

Afterward, Davis sought Reaves out so they could exchange jerseys. Reaves took it as a major sign of respect that a player of Davis’ caliber wanted his uniform.

“He’s one of the best players to touch a basketball,” Reaves said. “I don’t know why he wanted my jersey. But for me to get his is pretty fun.”

Davis had already helped lead the Lakers to a championship in 2020 when Reaves signed with the team as an undrafted free agent in 2021. In their 3 1/2 seasons as teammates, Davis watched Reaves transform from a crafty bench player to an every-night starter who averaged more than 20 points per game.

“He always had it,” Davis said. “I think with (LeBron) being out, it gave him a chance to be that two option. When Luka was out of the game, he could kind of flourish and have control of the ball. Even with (LeBron) back, he still has the ball.

“They’re putting a lot of trust in him. When I was here, I always liked his game and what he was able to do. Now he’s doing it on a more consistent basis.”

Davis was supposed to play between 24 and 27 minutes. He ended up playing 28 minutes, slightly above minutes restriction. He won’t suit up Saturday against the Clippers, which was his choice. If the Mavericks were only going to let him play one leg of the back-to-back, he wanted it to be against the Lakers.

“We are competing,” Davis said. “We are playing for each other. Playing together. Remember when Brooklyn started off (8-18) and ended up in the (playoffs)?”

The 2018-19 Nets got out of the gates slowly, just like the Mavericks have this year, and still nabbed a No. 6 seed in the East. Right now, forecasting that type of turnaround for Dallas feels unlikely. The Mavericks are so thin at guard that they turned to undrafted rookie Ryan Nembhard as a starter Friday. D’Angelo Russell, who ironically was an important member of that 2018-19 Nets squad, never got off the Mavericks’ bench Friday. He was a D.N.P. — coach’s decision.

“I thought the effort was there on the road against a very talented team,” Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “We gave ourselves an opportunity tonight.”

The Mavericks retook the lead with 7:52 remaining on a Davis dunk. The Lakers quickly responded, riding Reaves and Dončić to the win. That duo combined for 15 points in the fourth quarter.

“We’ll keep getting good looks,” Davis said. “Making the right plays. Just a couple plays here and there that hurt us. Just keep playing. Keep fighting. Keep a positive attitude. Feel like we are right there.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/29085223/251129-Anthony-Davis-scaled-e1764424368584.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-29 19:59:06.334846

""Offensively, just could not get our rhythm going, and really, it just started off with the run game.
""The film speaks for itself, what we've been able to accomplish in the run game this year,"" Dowdle said.
The Rams' defense is 13th in the league, allowing an average of 102.7 yards per game.
Obviously pass game helps out the run game, helps out the explosives, helps out the team, so we're working to be more consistent there.""","CHARLOTTE — The Panthers (6-6) are back on the East Coast this week and in the friendly confines of Bank of America Stadium to face the top team in the NFC, the Los Angeles Rams (9-2). This would be a tough matchup regardless, given the potency of the Rams offense, and the fact LA's scoring defense is top of the league. But the Panthers are coming off a short week that started with a loss against the 49ers.

However, Carolina hasn't lost back-to-back games since Week 2.

""Our process and just the belief that we're trying to find our best football,"" said coach Dave Canales as to the mindset. ""And making sure that we compartmentalize each game, win or lose.

""Our pursuit is to have continual growth fundamentally, and especially from a scheme standpoint.""

To do it this week will take everything they've got, particularly as they're shorthanded on defense. How does the secondary and run defense respond? Can the run game find its footing again? What does Bryce Young do? All that and more headline our five things to watch in Sunday's Week 13 matchup against the Rams.

What does the run game look like?

After the 49ers' loss, Dave Canales took a lot of responsibility for the fact that Rico Dowdle and Chuba Hubbard only had nine rushes between them.

""Offensively, just could not get our rhythm going, and really, it just started off with the run game. I have to make sure that comes alive,"" Canales said on Tuesday. ""That's a part of who we are. It's what we believe in, and we have two great backs that contribute to this team. The offensive line was blocking well, and that was a missed opportunity by me, and I'll do better in that regard.""

Dowdle averaged 6.3 yards a carry, and Hubbard picked up 5.3 yards per rush. After the game, Canales talked to the team and Dowdle privately, owning up to his role as the play caller, getting away from the run too quickly, and reaffirming a commitment to that part of the game moving forward.

""The film speaks for itself, what we've been able to accomplish in the run game this year,"" Dowdle said. ""This is a great coach. A lot of coaches don't; they won't take that ownership or things like that. But every time, it's been the outcome of what it's been; he's come in, and he's taken ownership, and we had to take our ownership from our end as players as well. So, great player-coach relationship.""

The Rams' defense is 13th in the league, allowing an average of 102.7 yards per game. Where they are slightly more susceptible is in missed tackles. The group is eighth in the league (133) and ninth in missed tackle percentage (24.6 percent). Dowdle is ninth in the league amongst running backs for most yards gained off of missed tackles (262 yards).

For him to work his way into the open field, though, he—and Hubbard—need to have the ball.

""I think that's the part that I can take accountability for, is making sure that it's a part of it throughout the process, throughout the game,"" said Canales. ""It gives us great balance, and I love to give the ball to Rico. I love to give the ball to Chuba, so that they can make an impact on the game in their own way.""

How does the run defense adjust without Tre'von Moehrig?

The defense took a hit in recent weeks due to injuries and a suspension. Now the run defense will have to take on Kyren Williams and the Rams without their top-two tacklers: hard-hitting safety Tre'von Moehrig and inside linebacker Christian Rozeboom. The veteran safety was suspended for one game by the commissioner for unsportsmanlike conduct.

Moehrig is the Panthers' second-leading tackler (81 tackles) and was second among all safeties in run stops (creating a negative play on a rush for the offense) with 23.

In his place, the Panthers will lean more on Lathan Ransom and Demani Richardson. Recently acquired Isaiah Simmons also remains a possibility. He was added to the practice squad this week and can play both linebacker and safety.

""(At) safety, we'll have our three, and then Isaiah Simmons, we plan on bringing him; he'll be helping out on special teams, and he's been in the meetings just ready to go if we need him,"" shared Canales.

The Panthers' leading tackler, Rozeboom (91 tackles), will miss his second straight week with a hip and hamstring injury. Claudin Cherelus also left Monday's game with a concussion and remains in the protocol. Krys Barnes, who started Monday's game alongside Cherelus, was officially signed from the practice squad to the 53-man roster this week, after using his three practice squad elevations.

The Panthers will get a huge boost in the middle of the defense, though, with the return of Trevin Wallace. The play caller and big tackler, who had 52 tackles with four for loss and 2.0 sacks when he was injured in Week 10, practiced as a full participant all week. The Panthers expect him to play on Sunday, returning their signal caller.

""I feel good, body feel good, shoulder feel good,"" Wallace listed this week of how he's improved. ""That's just the main concern is the shoulder. So hopefully I get to play Sunday.

""I feel like me and Krys, I feel like we're going to do all right. We're going to be all right because we clicked when he got here. We were really cool, and I feel like chemistry don't really start on the field, it starts off the field, so we had great chemistry off the field. So now we put it together on the field, just play off of each other.""

How does the secondary adjust without Jaycee Horn?

The middle of the field isn't the only place that will seem bereft this week. Jaycee Horn remains in concussion protocol and, therefore, is sidelined for Sunday's game. The Panthers will turn to Akayleb Evans more, as well as moving nickel Chau Smith-Wade to the outside at times. It's a position the defensive back hasn't played a ton of since coming to the NFL, but it was his primary position in college.

Those years of experience, peppered with the few times he has played outside in the league, give Canales and staff confidence in his ability to do so again Sunday if needed.

""You work through it at the same time. He's got a lot of reps out there, a lot of time on task with his eyes on the edge and playing that way. So, trusting in that part of it,"" said Canales.

""And then of course just throughout the course of the season, throughout the course of camp, he's been out there and done different things, so it's not strictly in his nickel role. And so, really counting on him to just come and help his teammates out, and he'll be ready to go.""

Whoever is out there gets a tough task in defending two of the best in the league: Puka Nacua and Davante Adams.

Nacua is the Rams' leading receiver with 947 yards (and fourth in the league overall) and gets a lot of the team's yards going down the field. He has run 45 percent of his routes as in-breaking, which is the eighth-most in the league amongst qualifying receivers (minimum 175 routes).

Then, once Los Angeles is in the red zone, Adams takes over. He leads all receivers in the entire NFL with 12 touchdowns.

""You can't deny that,"" defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero said this week, of the disproportionate numbers. And how it might mean playing the two guys. ""They're both great out on the field, and then certainly they've seemed to feature Davante more in the red zone, so we'll certainly be aware of that.""

Adams has caught eight touchdowns when facing press coverage this season; only one other receiver (Marvin Harrison Jr., with four) has even half as many touchdowns as Adams. Adams' six touchdowns from the goal line (inside the 3-yard line) are also at four, more than any other receiver this season.

Can the pass rush get to Matthew Stafford?

As Evero and defensive players noted all week, it's hard to throw anything at Matthew Stafford these days that would surprise the 17-year veteran. But, to quote Dave Canales, ""You could, you should, we should try to in different ways.""

It will be easier said than done. Stafford gets rid of the ball so quickly that defenses don't even get a chance to confuse him, much less sack him, since he's rarely leaving the pocket.

He's taken only 15 sacks, which is the fourth-fewest among qualifying quarterbacks (who have thrown at least 250 passes this season), and has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the NFL with a 30-2 mark.

""He's distributing the ball well to a bunch of different wide receivers, and he's playing great football,"" complimented Canales. ""He's getting the ball out fast, and he's going through his progressions. He has a group that he really trusts, and so we have to lean in on what they've been doing lately and make sure that we have solutions for that in our coverages and be aware of how they're trying to attack.""

Against the Bucs in Week 12, Stafford completed 22 of his 27 passes from a clean pocket, throwing for 243 yards and three touchdowns. Throughout the season, the vet has thrown 24 touchdowns against the blitz, more than double that of any other quarterback, while not throwing a single interception.

The Panthers have blitzed on 27.2 percent of opposing dropbacks, close to the league average of 28.3 percent. They've allowed a 44.5 percent success rate when blitzing, 14th-lowest in the NFL.

""Boy, who (Stafford) is, yeah, I mean just when you think about all the traits that you want from an elite quarterback, intelligent, he's got a great arm, he's got the experience now, obviously,"" said Evero. ""And then I think probably his strongest trait is that the guy doesn't flinch under pressure or under pressure, and so he's going to stand in there, he's going to take the hits, he's going to deliver the ball, and, so, yeah, immense amount of respect for him.""

How do Bryce Young and his receivers bounce back?

In Week 11, Bryce Young had the game of his life, and for that matter, the game of any Panthers' quarterback of all time, throwing for a franchise record 448 yards as the Panthers beat the Falcons.

Then, against the 49ers, the offense stuttered to a halt, never able to get the run or pass game going and running a mere 43 plays for 230 total yards. Sunday, even against a Rams defense that is holding teams to 208.5 passing yards per game, is a day to respond.

""It just boils down to execution,"" said Young this week. ""Obviously, it goes week to week; you've got to be able to turn the page, whether it's good or bad. We have all the guys in there with the right mindset. It's just execution.

""I think, first, just growing that identity, all of us, especially as a younger unit. But now everyone's pros, everyone's embraced it, there's no excuse for us not to be consistent, so that's just the challenge for us. At the end of the day, we want to do whatever it takes to win. Obviously pass game helps out the run game, helps out the explosives, helps out the team, so we're working to be more consistent there.""

One of the best ways the Panthers have found success in the pass game this season is when Young is able to work outside the pocket, evading pressure and receivers making themselves available.

According to Next Gen Stats, Young has thrown for 746 yards under pressure this season, the fourth-most in the NFL, and has the fifth-highest success rate (37.1 percent) among qualified quarterbacks when pressured.

""But Jared Verse packs a punch. He's got a lot of power on the edge. He's disruptive, he'll fool you, and he'll jump around at times, so you just have to make sure that you keep your feet in the ground.

""And that's the biggest thing, is feet in the ground, get your hands on early; ball snaps, hands got to be on because this is a really shifty, movement style of front. And then of course just their pass rush, they're relentless, and he looks for his opportunities, and I appreciate the style of play.""

Doing so against the Rams will mean negating Emmanuel Forbes. Against the Bucs on Sunday night, the corner did not allow a single reception on his 33 coverage snaps, despite being targeted seven times.

No other defender has been targeted as many times in a game without allowing a reception this season. Forbes also forced four tight window targets ( less than 1 yard of separation) and had a career-high five passes defensed.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/panthers/zq87u1fytx6nyraczxcl,N,,2025-11-29 19:00:50.847643

In the second half of the Premier League clash, City manager Pep Guardiola was able to give a brief team talk to his outfield players, while goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma received medical treatment.

The interruption to the match came with Leeds United in the ascendancy, causing problems for their hosts with a 5-3-2 shape Farke instigated at half-time. City were struggling, and their players needed intervention from Guardiola.

In his post-match press conference, Farke said: “Everyone knows why he went down, right? It’s not like the elephant in the room. It’s more like you can speak about it. You can ask me what I think about why he went down. It was obvious.”

Farke acknowledges there was nothing illegal in a player requiring treatment and the rest of the team using that moment to speak to their coach. However, he did not feel it was in the right spirit of fair play.

He added: “It’s within the rules. It’s smart. If I like it, if it’s in the sense of fair play, if it should be like this, I keep it to myself.

“I leave it with the authorities to find solutions for it. It’s within the rules. I asked the fourth official at this point, ‘Do you want to do something?’ He said, ‘No, our hands are tied. We can’t do anything’.

“We know this happens, but if we don’t educate our players in football, what to do in terms of fair play, sportsmanship and you just try to bend the rules to your advantage, you can even do a fake injury in order to do an additional team talk, it’s nothing I personally like.

“If it’s within the rules, I can’t complain about it. We should think about how we can deal with it, and also how we educate it.”

Guardiola was asked about the incident in his post-match press conference and said, “I didn’t speak with Gigi. I know what happened (and) when it happened, I looked back to the dugout to say, ‘James, warm up’. Honestly, I don’t know. Next press conference, you can ask me, I will ask Gigi.”

""Frank Ragnow reported to our facility yesterday and went through the normal process of meetings,"" the Lions said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, during the routine meeting with our medical team, Frank failed his physical. The medical exam revealed a Grade 3 hamstring strain that will keep him from participating for the remainder of the regular season. For that reason, Frank will not be rejoining the Lions.

Lions head coach Dan Campbell expressed his disappointment to reporters Saturday and said that the club was aware of a hamstring injury but the severity of it wasn't so clear until the physical. Campbell added that a potential return for Ragnow in 2026 was never discussed.

Ragnow, 29, retired in early June after weighing his future following a seven-year career.

The Lions moved Graham Glasgow from guard to center upon Ragnow's retirement. Rookie Tate Ratledge fulfilled Glasgow's old spot but injuries across Detroit's entire offensive line have cause problems for the offense.

Landry III has been managing a knee injury over the last few weeks, as he'll carry a questionable designation for the second consecutive game.
Landry III playing through a knee injury could explain his recent dip in production.","The Patriots are preparing for their first Monday Night Football matchup since the 2022 season, and several players will carry injury designations into Monday night's game vs. the Giants.

On Saturday, the Patriots ruled out G Jared Wilson (ankle) and special-teams ace Brenden Schooler (ankle) while OLB Harold Landry III (knee) and DT Khyiris Tonga (chest) are officially questionable for Monday night. For the Giants, QB Jaxson Dart has cleared concussion protocol and will start for New York. However, the Giants ruled out OLB Kayvon Thibodeaux (shoulder).

Starting on offense, New England will start its third different offensive line combination of the season vs. the Giants after rookie LT Will Campbell (knee) and G Jared Wilson (ankle) sustained injuries in the Patriots win over the Bengals last week. Campbell was placed on injured reserve earlier this week, meaning he'll miss at least the next four games, while Wilson remains on the active roster with what's reportedly a high-ankle sprain for the third-round guard. It's unclear when the Patriots could get their rookie linemen back, so for now, at least, they'll need two new starters against a formidable Giants defensive front.

On Wednesday, head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed that OT Vederian Lowe will start for Campbell at left tackle. Lowe finished last week's game after Campbell exited, allowing two hurries on 16 pass-blocking snaps. The fourth-year pro also started 13 games at left tackle for the Patriots last season, so Lowe has NFL experience on the blindside. At left guard, the expectation is that top interior backup Ben Brown will step in for Wilson. Brown was also the next man up in Cincinnati when Wilson was injured on the third play from scrimmage.

Although they were a part of an offensive line that struggled last season, Brown and Lowe are entering a much different situation with the Patriots at 10-2. New England's coaching staff, led by offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and offensive line coach Doug Marrone, is held in high regard in terms of aiding the offensive line with the help of chips, extra protectors to double-team bigger threats, and moving the pocket for QB Drake Maye. It's also worth noting that Maye will have his full complement of weapons at his disposal. The O-Line might be banged up, but Maye and the skill players can hopefully up their games to help out the line.

From this perspective, we could see more max-protection schemes in which the Patriots send only two or three receivers into the pattern. The Giants enter the week as the last-ranked run defense in yards per carry (5.9) and EPA per rush (+0.19). In theory, if New England could find a run game and then script heavy protections off play-action to push the ball downfield, they could attack a weakness in the Giants defense and keep Maye protected with six or seven blockers accounting for New York's talented pass rush.

Still, the Patriots rookies are a huge reason why the offensive line has improved this season. The Patriots are 20th in pass-blocking win rate and 15th in run-blocking win rate compared to 31st and 32nd in ESPN's win rate metrics in 2024. The Patriots will need Brown and Lowe to step up for however long they'll need to start, while it'll also be interesting to see how McDaniels and the coaching staff scheme around having two backups on the left side.

Moving over to the Patriots defense, Landry III (knee) and Tonga (chest) are two key pieces on the defensive front whose status are uncertain for Monday night's game.

Landry III has been managing a knee injury over the last few weeks, as he'll carry a questionable designation for the second consecutive game. Landry III playing through a knee injury could explain his recent dip in production. In the first five games, the Pats captain logged 3.5 sacks and 22 total pressures, but the veteran edge rusher only has two sacks and 14 total pressures in the last six games, a split that also coincides with an injury scare in New Orleans (Week 6). To his credit, Landry III is toughing it out through his knee injury, but the late bye week might be coming at a good time for the 29-year-old following Monday night's game.

As for Tonga, the big nose tackle's absence loomed large in the win over the Bengals, where the Patriots allowed their first 100-yard rusher of the season (Cincy RB Chase Brown). This season, New England is allowing +0.02 rush expected points added when Tonga isn't on the field, compared to -0.10 EPA per rush when Tonga is on the field – a huge difference. Tonga also plays a role on offense as a short-yardage lead blocker, causing a significant ripple effect to the Pats run defense and goal-line offense, which went 0-for-2 in Cincinnati last week.

Along with their banged-up nose tackle, standout DT Milton Williams (ankle) is also on injured reserve. Williams will miss his second of at least four games on Monday night. Alongside star DT Christian Barmore, the Patriots leaned on defensive tackles Cory Durden (33 snaps), practice-squad elevation Jeremiah Pharms Jr. (20 snaps), and DT Eric Gregory (18 snaps) against the Bengals. One would expect a similar rotation vs. the Giants, with Tonga hopefully available as well (Tonga only played 12 snaps on defense vs. the Bengals).

Lastly, special teams captain Brenden Schooler will miss just the second game of his career on Monday night due to an ankle injury. Replacing the All-Pro's impact while covering kicks and punts won't be easy, while it also complicates the depth chart since Schooler is on five different special-teams units. It'll be worth monitoring how effective the Patriots are at covering kicks, especially punts, without their leading tackler and best gunner on special teams.

The next step for the Patriots will be practice squad elevations, which don't need to be made official until Monday afternoon rather than the day before the game. One would expect that Pharms will be elevated for the second consecutive week, while another spot could go to a special teams contributor to help fill the void left behind by Schooler. New England will then host the Giants on Monday Night Football at Gillette Stadium at 8:15 p.m. ET.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/jvsv97biv3zaqwhupeet,N,,2025-11-29 17:59:37.426476

“It is a really good comparison,” Glenn said of Hall and Robinson, “but there’s also some differences between those guys, too.","There are not many reasons to watch the 4-7 Falcons visit the 2-9 Jets, who are playing out the string without a pair of stars traded at the deadline and with Garrett Wilson sidelined with injury.

But a matchup of two of the more electric running backs in the NFL — and an opportunity for the Jets’ rusher to redeem himself — provides plenty of intrigue.

Breece Hall and Bijan Robinson meet again Sunday, Hall owning a 2-1 lifetime record against his pal.

Hall’s Iowa State teams beat Robinson’s Texas teams twice during their collegiate careers, where the two struck up a friendship, before Robinson’s Falcons beat the Jets in 2023.

“That’s my boy. That’s been my boy since college. I’m excited to go against him,” Hall said after practice Thursday. “I’m up in our little series.”

Two of the best running backs in the Big 12 one year apart — Hall was a second-round pick in 2022 and Robinson a first-round pick in ’23 — have renewed their friendly rivalry.

Robinson is fourth in the NFL in yards from scrimmage (1,396) and averages 6.3 yards per touch despite defenses focused on shutting down Atlanta’s best player. His greatest strength might be just how many strengths he possesses.

“He’s so dynamic in so many areas,” said Steve Wilks, the defensive coordinator of a Jets team whose run defense has made strides and will be tested, “out of the backfield, out in space, screen game, they use him as a receiver.”

“A complete package,” Hall added of Robinson. “He’s really good in pass [protection]. He can catch and run. He can run inside zone, outside zone, power, counter … catch a screen and take it to the house.”

All of which invites a comparison involving the two engines of offenses that are led right now by underwhelming veteran quarterbacks on underwhelming teams.

“I hate to compare players, but I can see where that comparison really comes at because both of those guys are really good,” Jets head coach Aaron Glenn said this week. “They’re three-down backs, first off. Both of those guys are really good as far as being in the backfield, being able to run the ball, but then again, you can split those guys out wide and allow those guys to be a receiver for you.”

Hall has been a bright spot in a dark season. In his past four games, he has eclipsed 100 yards from scrimmage three times. After surviving a trade-deadline sell-off in which Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams exited, and with Wilson shelved, Hall has picked up his own game.

On Sunday in Baltimore, he was easily the Jets’ best player, his elusiveness and yards-after-the-catch skills bringing the Jets into position to cut the deficit to three points in the fourth quarter.

Which is when Hall was stripped at the Ravens’ 2-yard line. Offensive coordinator Tanner Engstrand found Hall after the loss and told him he was the reason the Jets were even threatening in the drive.

“[Coaches] know I’m more disappointed in myself than anybody else could be,” the fourth-year pro said Thursday. “It’s a thing of just coming back and just getting better and not doing it [again].”

Hall’s performance matters for a team that often needs to run to move the ball and for a team that is evaluating a pending free agent. The Jets can attempt to lock up Hall long-term or franchise tag him to ensure he sticks around.

Games like Sunday’s — when he will get a chance to stand out from another standout running back — will factor into those decisions.

“It is a really good comparison,” Glenn said of Hall and Robinson, “but there’s also some differences between those guys, too. But I like our guy.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/newspress-collage-gn66stmcw-1764373406390.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1764355432&w=1200,N,,2025-11-29 19:59:11.305867

Here is what to watch for while scarfing down Thanksgiving leftovers on Sunday:

Miami Dolphins vs New Orleans Saints (Sunday, 1 p.m., FOX)

While not the flashiest of contests, the Dolphins have won back-to-back games for the first time this season. On the other end are the Saints (2-9), a struggling squad led by rookie quarterback Tyler Shough.

The Dolphins (4-7) are fresh off their bye week, which they used to prioritize health and recovery. Tight end Darren Waller is set to make his return after landing on IR since Oct. 22. The veteran route runner suffered a pectoral injury after finding the end zone four times in three games early in the season.

Miami’s playbook will open if Waller is able to play Sunday. Whether he is available or not, Dolphins running back De’Von Achane will be set to take charge once again. The third-year ball carrier is leading the Dolphins’ offense both on the ground and through the air.

Achane is No. 4 in the league in rushing yards (900) and has nine touchdowns on the year. He accumulated 226 and 165 total yards across the previous two weeks, respectively.

New Orleans’ run defense stacks up to No. 21 in the league. It allowed Los Angeles Rams rusher Kyren Williams to post 114 yards on 25 carries three weeks ago.

The Saints watched as Kirk Cousins and the Atlanta Falcons dominated in New Orleans. While Shough managed 243 passing yards, the rest of the squad forgot to show up. The team’s lack of rushing attack proved detrimental in the loss. Running back Alvin Kamara exited the contest early due to a knee injury that could keep him sidelined for some time.

Despite the Dolphins allowing the fourth-most rush yards per game, watch for Miami to dominate the trenches early. Shough was sacked five times against the Falcons and led the team with just 22 yards on the ground.

Best Black Friday Deal: Achane will find the end zone at least once Sunday.

Riley’s pick: Dolphins 28, Saints 10

Dalton’s pick: Dolphins 27, Saints 17

Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs Arizona Cardinals (Sunday, 1 p.m., FOX)

The Bucs’ injury bug has caught wind of quarterback Baker Mayfield. One of the toughest gun slingers in the league went down on Sunday Night Football with a shoulder injury.

While it is not determined how much time he will miss, Mayfield’s ailment hurts the team in various aspects. Bucs fans will watch backup Teddy Bridgewater at the helm if Mayfield is unable to suit up on Sunday.

Although, Tampa Bay (6-5) inched closer to seeing some offensive weapons return. Running back Bucky Irving is set to play after missing seven weeks. Also, wide receiver Chris Godwin Jr. was welcomed back last week.

Both the Bucs and Cardinals (3-8) are in the midst of a losing streak. Each NFC squad has dropped its last three contests.

Cards quarterback Jacoby Brissett has taken the league by storm, even if he has not produced wins. The journeyman has averaged 314.5 yards since taking over for the injured Kyler Murray.

Brissett is set to face the No. 27 pass defense in the league on Sunday. The Bucs allowed Rams QB Matthew Stafford to throw for 273 yards and three touchdowns. Brissett has surpassed that yards total on four separate occasions this year.

The last time Tampa Bay and Arizona faced off was on Christmas in 2022. The Bucs pulled out the 19-16 win in overtime, sending the series record to 11-11.

Best Black Friday Deal: Brissett will throw for more than 275 yards for the fifth time this year.

Riley: Buccaneers 24, Cardinals 21

Dalton: Buccaneers 28, Cardinals 10

Jacksonville Jaguars at Tennessee Titans (Sunday, 1 p.m., CBS)

The Jags (7-4) may be the league’s largest wild cards. They pulled out an overtime victory last week in Arizona, dominated the Chargers the week prior and barely managed a win against the Raiders two games before that.

Quarterback Trevor Lawrence is in the midst of the team’s question marks. The former first overall draft selection tossed three touchdowns in the win — plus three interceptions.

The Tennessee native now has 14 scores with 11 picks and has been sacked 29 times. The brightest spot on the Jags’ offense has been running back Travis Etienne Jr.

Etienne, Lawrence’s teammate at Clemson, has 815 rushing yards and seven total scores this season. He found the end zone for the fourth time in three games in last week’s win.

The Titans (1-10) hold the league’s No. 25 run defense, so watch out for Etienne to produce another quality performance.

Tennessee sits among the bottom of the league across the board. With its one win coming against the Cardinals in Week 5, the Titans have floundered since.

Rookie quarterback Cam Ward posted one of his best games last week with 256 passing yards and a 66.7 completion rate. The 2025 first overall draft pick has been sacked a league-leading 45 times.

The Jags are No. 5 in quarterback hurries with 45. Jacksonville will find its third consecutive win if it can generate pressure on Ward.

Best Black Friday Deal: The Jaguars will bring Ward down upward of four times.

Quarterbacks

Baker Mayfield

Injury: Left AC joint sprain

Analysis: Baker is dealing with either a grade I or II left AC joint sprain. These grades are always treated conservatively and tell us the joint is stable enough to be played through. Given that this is Baker's non-throwing shoulder, his ability to deliver the ball down the field is not a concern. The only concern with this injury is if Baker takes just one bad hit, his injury could be aggravated and knock him out of the game. The re-injury possibility is a real risk, and while his production while on the field won't be affected, fantasy managers will want to see at least who else they could start in Baker's place this week. If there is no one good available, you can still roll the dice with Baker.

Daniel Jones

Injury: Left Fibula fracture

Analysis: Jones is playing through a fracture in his left fibula. The fibula is one of the two bones in the lower leg, and the good news is that the fibula only bears about 15-20% of body weight during heavy activity, which is why Jones can push through. His ability to play also indicates this is a small break, whereas Omarion Hampton has missed the last seven weeks with a fibula fracture. The single most important factor here that is allowing Jones to continue to play is that it is his left fibula, not his right. A right-handed passer drives off the right foot and ankle for throwing power. The lateral portion of the lower leg (where the fibula is located) is particularly stressed during throwing. If this were Jones' right leg, he would be in a tough position attempting to throw.

Practice videos did show Jones limping and looking slower during his three and five-step drops (when the left leg is predominantly pushing off), but reporters stated that overall, he looked good. Jones should retain value while playing through his injury, but rushing upside will be reduced, and there is absolutely risk for worsening the injury.",https://fantasyinjuryteam.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bucky-Irving-full-pic-2.webp,N,,2025-11-29 16:01:16.066978

Both starting tackles, Dion Dawkins and Spencer Brown, have been ruled out for Sunday’s showdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Bills’ injury situation has been a massive challenge all season, mostly on the defensive side of the ball, but now the offense is facing a major problem up front against a Pittsburgh defense that features two outstanding edge rushers in TJ Watt and Nate Herbig.

Dawkins suffered a concussion in the loss to Houston and has not been able to clear the NFL’s protocol, and Brown went down with a shoulder injury and it was pretty clear he had no chance of playing when that happened. The Dawkins situation is a little different because he finished the loss to the Texans, but the symptoms popped up the next day and he’s still experiencing issues.

Buffalo Bills injury report: Other players ruled out

Coach Sean McDermott also ruled out linebacker Terrel Bernard due to the dislocated elbow he suffered at Houston, and wide receiver Curtis Samuel is out with elbow and knee injuries. And then following practice, Samuel was placed on injured reserve, a move that could ultimately be the end of his vastly unimpressive and disappointing time with the Bills.

In place of Dawkins and Brown, Ryan Van Demark will certainly be one of the starters, probably at left tackle, but on the right side, it’s uncertain who will play. Rookie Chase Lundt is an option, but second-year man Tylan Grable could get the call.

Grable has missed the entire season due to a concussion, but the Bills opened his 21-day practice window this week, so he could be added to the 53-man roster if the coaching staff believes he’s ready to go.

On Wednesday, McDermott said of Grable, “He’s a young player that we have a lot of confidence in. He hasn’t played in a while - he went out, I believe, in preseason there, if not before. So we get that, we understand that. We’ll just take it one day at a time, and he’ll work back in and we’ll go from there.”

With Bernard out, Shaq Thompson will likely start next to Matt Milano, and with Samuel now done, the Bills have several ways they could go at receiver. The first occurred after the Samuel IR news as Gabe Davis was officially signed off the practice squad to the 53-man roster. What we can also expect is that Keon Coleman will play after he was a healthy scratch the last two games. Lastly, Brandin Cooks is almost assuredly going to play even though was added to the team Tuesday.

Both Coleman and Cooks may need to be up because there is a question regarding Joshua Palmer’s availability. His ankle injury that forced him to miss three games has flared up and he did not practice Thursday and was limited on Friday.

If Palmer can’t play, all the Bills have is Khalil Shakir, Tyrell Shavers, Davis, Coleman, and Cooks.

Bills players who have a chance of playing vs Steelers

As for tight end Dalton Kincaid, he has been limited all week in practice and he’ll be questionable at best for the game.

Cornerback Maxwell Hairston, who was in concussion protocol during the week, practiced in full Thursday and Friday and McDermott said he’s moving in the right direction, so he will likely be able to play.

NFL Week 13 lands right on Thanksgiving, and Roger Goodell actually did something right for once – a full slate, no byes, and wall-to-wall football from Thursday through the weekend.

That’s awesome for fans… and a landmine field for fantasy managers.

NFL Week 13 Injury Report – Episode Breakdown & Timestamps

00:00 – Thanksgiving Slate & Why Week 13 Is Different

Doc sets the scene: a full Thanksgiving week with all 32 teams active, no byes, and why roster management is more important than ever.

00:31 – IDP-First Format & How to Use This Show

Explanation of the IDP-heavy structure, why most injury content is offense-only, and how this series gives defensive diehards the edge.

02:28 – Patrick Surtain Pec Strain (Broncos)

Doc explains why Surtain’s return to limited practice after a mid-grade pec strain is a strong sign he’s nearing game action, and why skipping IR always hinted at a 3–6 week timeline.

05:06 – Arizona Cardinals Defensive Injury Cluster (Nolan, Browning, Sweat, Taylor-Demerson)

Walter Nolan (knee), Baron Browning (concussion), Josh Sweat (eye), and Daydrian Taylor-Demerson (ankle) all sit Wednesday, with Doc flagging Browning and Demerson as the bigger red flags after already missing last week.

07:48 – Will Johnson’s Back/Hip Return Window (Cardinals)

Rookie CB Will Johnson finally logs a limited practice after multiple weeks out; Doc sees this as a strong “trending in” sign but warns that no full practice by Friday could mean a ramp-up week instead of full snaps.

08:51 – Carolina Panthers: Christian Roseboom & JC Horn Concussion Watch

Roseboom (hip) misses another Wednesday after sitting last week, while Horn lands in the concussion protocol after a monster two-INT game; Doc walks through modern concussion timelines and why both are on the pessimistic side if they don’t practice by Thursday.

12:03 – Terrel Bernard Elbow Injury (Bills)

Bernard’s sling on the sideline and no practice after a mini-bye screams “doubtful” to Doc, who explains why this doesn’t look like a full dislocation but still profiles as a multi-week problem.

13:26 – Chicago Bears Secondary Returns vs. Linebacker Carnage

Kyler Gordon (calf) and Jaylon Johnson (groin) stack full practices and look ready to be activated off IR, while TJ Edwards (hamstring), Noah Sewell (elbow), and Tyrique Stevenson (hip) all pile up DNPs and sit firmly in the doubtful bucket.

15:39 – Trey Hendrickson Hip Mystery Lingers (Bengals)

Hendrickson is still out, hasn’t practiced, and Doc calls out the disconnect between early “minor” coach-speak and a now multi-week absence that never went to IR.

17:04 – Denzel Ward Migraines (Browns)

Ward misses with migraines, and Doc compares this to a recent IR stint for a similar issue, noting that severity can range from a short blip to something that behaves like a concussion in terms of availability.

18:12 – Kerby Joseph’s Lingering Absence (Lions)

Joseph is ruled out again with still no real on-field progress, and Doc questions why he never hit IR given the length of the absence.

18:48 – Terrion Arnold Concussion Timeline (Lions)

Arnold already missed one game but returns to practice and carries a questionable tag; Doc notes that when teams leave concussed players “questionable” on a short week, they usually expect them to be active.

19:46 – Packers Secondary & LB Question Marks (Walker, Hobbs, Nixon)

LB Quay Walker (stinger), CB Nate Hobbs, and CB Keisean Nixon are all banged up and questionable; Doc explains why neck/stinger issues are scary but the fact Walker’s already practicing is encouraging, and why all three are true 50/50 calls.

21:19 – Travon Walker Knee Concern (Jaguars)

Travon Walker still isn’t practicing after multiple weeks out with a vague “knee” designation, and Doc flags the lack of detail and lack of ramp-up work as worrying for Week 13 availability.

22:09 – Ahkello Witherspoon’s Clavicle Return (Rams)

Witherspoon logs a full practice after a fractured collarbone, and Doc explains why fractures are simple: once cleared for contact, you’re generally “all the way back.”

23:06 – Rams Secondary & Front Seven Nicks (Kinchens & Byron Young)

Safety Kamren Kinchens (shoulder) and OLB Byron Young (knee) both sit Wednesday; Doc isn’t panicking yet but says back-to-back DNPs would flip them from “monitor” to “real concern.”

23:45 – Giants Edge/Interior Issues: Kayvon Thibodeaux & Dexter Lawrence

Thibodeaux’s mysterious multi-week shoulder absence and Lawrence’s flare-up in the previously surgically repaired elbow have Doc leaning pessimistic, both for Week 13 and for Lawrence’s fantasy usefulness in general.

25:12 – Eagles Safety Room Shakeup: Andrew Mukuba, Reed Blankenship & Brandon Graham

Rookie Andrew Mukuba hits IR with an ankle fracture that’s likely season-ending; Reed Blankenship looks more like a thigh/knee contusion and trends toward playing, while Brandon Graham’s groin plus “off the couch” conditioning put him in more of a true questionable bucket.

26:56 – 49ers High Ankle Woes: Sam O. & Tatum Bethune

Sam Okuayinonu suffers a high ankle sprain, and Doc explains why even mild versions are 4–6 week issues; Tatum Bethune is already out multiple weeks with a similar injury and is projected to sit at least 2–3 more.

28:29 – Buccaneers Edge & Corner Update: Haason Reddick & Jamel Dean

Reddick and Dean both return to practice Wednesday; Doc likes Dean’s chances to play, but based on Todd Bowles’ history with Bucky Irving and Chris Godwin, he expects a more conservative ramp-up for Reddick after a multi-week absence.

29:26 – Transition to Offensive Rundown

Doc signs off the defensive diehards and pivots to a fast, offense-focused injury rundown for fantasy managers who play both sides of the ball.

29:47 – Marvin Harrison Jr. (Appendectomy) – Cardinals WR

Back at practice after two weeks off post-appendectomy, and trending strongly toward playing in Week 13.

30:04 – Drake London PCL Injury (Falcons)

Doc explains why PCL injuries are nasty and why London being tagged doubtful fits a multi-week expectation rather than a quick bounce-back.

30:18 – Joe Burrow Returns; Tee Higgins Out (Bengals)

Burrow is activated off IR with full practices and is locked in as a start, while Higgins is ruled out with a concussion on a short week.

30:47 – Josh Allen Elbow Update (Bills)

Despite taking eight sacks and getting beat up, Allen logs a full practice off the mini-bye and is cleared as full go.

31:00 – CJ Stroud Concussion Clearance (Texans)

Stroud finally returns as a full participant after a rare three-game concussion absence and is expected back under center.

31:16 – Brian Thomas Jr. High Ankle Sprain (Jaguars)

Thomas is limited in practice after two missed games; Doc notes that Week 3 off a high ankle is still dicey but the practice trend is promising.

31:36 – Omari(on) Hampton Ankle Fracture Return (Panthers)

Hampton was originally billed as a “high ankle sprain” but actually had an ankle fracture; he’s back practicing, with Doc expecting either a ramp-up week or a carefully managed workload.

32:04 – Alvin Kamara & Devin Neal Backfield Outlook (Saints)

Kamara is doubtful after an ugly roll-up, opening the door for Devin Neal to function as the RB1 with Kendre Miller already out for the year.

32:20 – Jackson Dart Concussion Protocol (Jets)

Dart is a full participant on Wednesday before a Monday game; Doc would be shocked if he doesn’t clear protocol in time to start.

32:37 – Bucky Irving Foot/Shoulder Recovery (Buccaneers)

Irving logs a full Wednesday session after a long foot/shoulder grind and is positioned to roll into a great matchup versus a beat-up Cardinals defense.

32:51 – Jayden Daniels Return Timeline (Commanders)

Daniels is back practicing but expected to sit Week 13; Doc expects Washington to be cautious and circle next week for his return in a lost season.

Offensive Injury Rundown: Quick Fantasy Impact

Here’s the condensed fantasy lens from Doc’s offensive segment:

Marvin Harrison Jr. (Cardinals WR, appendectomy)

Back at practice after a two-week absence.

👉 Fantasy: Treat him as in if he avoids setbacks — start as usual in all formats.

Drake London (Falcons WR, PCL)

Tagged doubtful and dealing with the same tricky ligament that wrecked Ricky Pearsall and Puka Nacua for stretches.

👉 Fantasy: Expect multiple weeks out. Plan alternatives for both Week 13 and potentially Week 14.

Joe Burrow (Bengals QB, IR return)

Full practices, activated, and historically shreds the Ravens.

👉 Fantasy: Locked-in QB1. Don’t get cute — start him.

Tee Higgins (Bengals WR, concussion)

Short week + concussion = already ruled out.

👉 Fantasy: Bench. Boost volume expectations for other Bengals pass-catchers.

Josh Allen (Bills QB, elbow)

Took a beating but full-go off the mini-bye.

👉 Fantasy: Auto-start; no meaningful downgrade.

CJ Stroud (Texans QB, concussion)

Unusually long, three-game absence but now a full participant.

👉 Fantasy: If active, treat as normal Stroud — locked into starting consideration.

Brian Thomas Jr. (Jaguars WR, high ankle)

Two weeks missed, back limited.

👉 Fantasy: Fringe WR3/flex if active, but understand re-aggravation and limited snap risk in his first game back.

Omari(on) Hampton (Panthers RB, ankle fracture)

True 2–3 month fracture, now back practicing.

👉 Fantasy: If activated, expect a ramp-up week with split usage before full workloads return.

Alvin Kamara (Saints RB, lower leg)

No practice and described as doubtful after an ugly roll-up.

👉 Fantasy: Treat as out. Devin Neal becomes a volume-driven RB2 with upside if the Saints don’t overcomplicate things.

Devin Neal (Saints RB)

Next man up with Kamara doubtful and Kendre Miller out for the season.

👉 Fantasy: Strong plug-and-play option in deeper leagues; viable DFS value play.

Jackson Dart (Jets QB, concussion)

Full participant ahead of a Monday game.

👉 Fantasy: All signs point to him starting; viable in superflex and 2QB formats.

Bucky Irving (Buccaneers RB, foot/shoulder)

Full Wednesday practice after an extended absence.

👉 Fantasy: If active, green light as an RB2/FLEX in a soft matchup vs an injured Cardinals defense.

Jayden Daniels (Commanders QB)

Back practicing but expected to sit one more.

👉 Fantasy: Bench for Week 13, but stash where possible — Doc expects him back next week with the franchise focused on long-term health.

Expert OVER/UNDER Betting & Fantasy Football Takeaway

Doc’s Week 13 board isn’t just noise; it changes how you should attack both fantasy and betting:

High ankle sprains linger

Guys like Sam Okuayinonu, Tatum Bethune, and Brian Thomas Jr. are dealing with high ankles — even when they’re active, explosion and lateral movement usually lag for weeks.

👉 Don’t chase “he’s back!” hype with overs or ceiling projections right away.

Concussions are still mostly multi-week

Baron Browning, JC Horn, Terrion Arnold, Tee Higgins, Jackson Dart, and CJ Stroud are all on different points of the concussion spectrum. The pattern: most guys still miss at least one week, and second-week returns require clean limited-to-full practice progression.

👉 If there’s any doubt, fade fragile overs and lean toward safer floor options.

Neck injuries & stingers are major red flags

Quay Walker’s “stinger” and prior neck issues get special attention from Doc. Neck + football is a bad combo.

👉 In IDP, don’t over-commit to guys returning from neck trouble until they prove they’re past it with full snaps.

Fractures are binary: out, then all the way in

Ahkello Witherspoon and Andrew Mukuba show both sides: once cleared, Witherspoon should function at or near normal. Mukuba, meanwhile, is effectively done for 2025 outside of a miracle Super Bowl timeline.

👉 When fracture guys return, you can usually trust the role. But don’t expect them to beat the calendar.

IR returns and ramp-up weeks matter for snap share

Between Kyler Gordon, Jaylon Johnson, Will Johnson, Haason Reddick, Omari(on) Hampton, and Bucky Irving, you’ve got a cluster of potential “active, but not fully featured” players.

👉 For fantasy and props, favor healthy full-practice players with clear roles over “returning” names with ambiguous snap counts.

IDP replacement snaps are gold

Chicago’s linebacker room, the Cardinals’ defense, the Giants’ front, the Lions’ secondary, and others are all thinned out.

👉 In IDP, you win Week 13 by chasing clean snaps and opportunity on these patched-together units instead of clinging to big names who are 50/50 at best.

Bottom line for Week 13:

Prioritize health, volume, and clarity over brand names with sketchy medicals.

With a full slate and no byes, you don’t need to force questionable tags into lineups just to field a team.

And, as of the end of the final practice on Friday, Head Coach Todd Bowles was ready to say that Mayfield is on track to keep his starting streak alive on Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.
Mayfield was deemed a non-participant in a walk-through practice on Wednesday and was still limited on Thursday but showed clear improvement by the end of the week.
If Mayfield had been sidelined by his injury, Teddy Bridgewater would have made his first start as a Buccaneer.
Tampa Bay has lost three in a row but remains in first place in the NFC South and has not lost any faith in its ability to achieve its goals for 2025.","The Tampa Bay Buccaneers may not have to make a change at quarterback after all.

Baker Mayfield, who has started every game for the Buccaneers since the 2023 season opener, watched the second half of the team's loss in Los Angeles from the sideline with his left arm in a sling, generating significant concern that he would miss some time during the playoff stretch run. However, positive results from MRI exams indicated no structural damage in his left shoulder and he has steadily progressed during the Bucs' week of practice.

And, as of the end of the final practice on Friday, Head Coach Todd Bowles was ready to say that Mayfield is on track to keep his starting streak alive on Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.

""We have,"" said Bowles when asked if he had made a decision at quarterback. ""He looked good today so he's trending to play.""

Mayfield was deemed a non-participant in a walk-through practice on Wednesday and was still limited on Thursday but showed clear improvement by the end of the week.

""He had to get well,"" said Bowles. ""He was very limited on Wednesday, he did a little more yesterday and he moved around perfectly today, so he's fine.""

If Mayfield had been sidelined by his injury, Teddy Bridgewater would have made his first start as a Buccaneer. The Buccaneers also likely would have either promoted rookie quarterback Connor Bazelak to the active roster or elevated him from the practice squad for game day. The team could still make that latter move if it feels any uncertainty about Mayfield's status, but that decision doesn't have to be made until 4:00 p.m. on Saturday.

Though the Bucs have full confidence in Bridgewater, a 12th-year veteran who has a career 33-32 record as a starting quarterback in the NFL, there's little doubt that the presence of Mayfield, the team's emotional leader, would give them a boost on Sunday against the Cardinals. Tampa Bay has lost three in a row but remains in first place in the NFC South and has not lost any faith in its ability to achieve its goals for 2025.

""We've got plenty of confidence; we never lost that,"" said Bowles. ""It's just picking up on the little things from an execution standpoint. We all know we have to do our jobs better, and that's coaches and players, but it has nothing to do with confidence. Just execution.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/buccaneers/vumszcfvlr8jyf5u14dk,N,,2025-11-29 13:03:12.239123

The Giants announced Dart officially cleared concussion protocol on Thursday.
But Dart slid twice and thought the hit that caused his concussion wasn't one he could've completely avoided.
Dart praised the Giants medical staff even though he returned to the contest for two more plays following the injury.
""And Coach [Daboll], who knows if I'm here without him.","EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Jaxson Dart is unequivocally back as the starting quarterback for the New York Giants. And he will be taking all the first-team reps this week in preparation for the New England Patriots on ""Monday Night Football,"" interim coach Mike Kafka said on Friday.

The Giants announced Dart officially cleared concussion protocol on Thursday. He had missed the previous two games with Jameis Winston starting in his place.

""I'm ready. I've been waiting for it,"" Dart said after practice on Friday. ""Obviously these primetime games are the ones you have circled on your calendar. I'm excited to go out there, compete at a high level and do everything in my power to rally these guys to put our team in the best situation when the clock hits zero that we're going to come out with a win.""

New York (2-10) has dropped six straight games. Meanwhile, the Patriots (10-2) have won nine straight.

The Giants will be trying to snap a franchise-record 12-game road skid with their rookie quarterback back behind center.

""It's great to get him back in the mix,"" Kafka said. ""He's been prepping.""

Dart came close to returning last week. He felt he could play, but the doctors thought otherwise. The first-round pick didn't clear the concussion protocol.

Now, he returns knowing there must be more prudence about the hits he takes. Dart is taking almost 10 hits per game.

Even though Dart thought he did better in the game in which he sustained a concussion Nov. 9 in Chicago, it was still the fourth time in eight games dating back to the preseason that he needed to be evaluated for a concussion. That equals a lot of time being off the field.

""Moving forward, I have to be more available for this team,"" Dart said. ""This is obviously on the forefront of my mind moving forward.""

Dart took exception to the idea that his head was getting checked during all those concussion tests. He said that was not the case. Some of the previous tests were prompted by other potential warnings signs, such as him being out of breath or having a stinger, not direct hits to the head, he said.

The bottom line is that Dart still had to leave the game in all four circumstances. And the actual concussion cost him two games during his rookie season.

""I'm still getting used to this game. I'm getting used to this speed, this level,"" Dart said. ""In college, you can watch my tape, I very rarely slid. This is a different beast. For me, I have to obviously be more responsible when I'm in the open field. But I felt I was getting better at it each and every week.""

Dart didn't see any hits in the Chicago matchup that he should've avoided. He thought he was playing smart as former coach Brian Daboll and the Giants called six designed runs in that contest. But Dart slid twice and thought the hit that caused his concussion wasn't one he could've completely avoided.

Dart praised the Giants medical staff even though he returned to the contest for two more plays following the injury. They eventually pulled him between quarters.

""I wasn't in a good space to be out there,"" Dart said.

Dart will be playing his first game without Daboll, who was fired on Nov. 10. He started his first press conference since the injury with an opening statement about his former head coach.

Daboll and Dart were known to have a strong relationship, on and off the field.

""I have all the respect in the world for him. He's an incredible offensive mind. He's done an amazing job developing me up until this point, and you know, this business is a beast,"" Dart said. ""Give a shout to coach Shane [Bowen] as well. We just weren't able to get enough wins for them. But at the same time, got a lot of respect for them.

""And Coach [Daboll], who knows if I'm here without him. So I have all the respect for him and love for him.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0929%2Fr1552748_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-29 16:01:23.520549

,,2025-11-29 13:01:07+00:00,NBC News,An injured star QB could play soon. Does that mean it's worth it? - NBC News,Andrew Greif,,,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/nfl/nfl-commanders-bengals-injury-quarterback-rcna245939,"The game’s outcome had effectively been determined when star Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels trotted out for another possession with 12 minutes remaining on Nov. 2.

Broncos (9-2) at Commanders (3-8): Denver QB Bo Nix has five game-winning drives this season, tied with Chicago’s Caleb Williams for most in the league.","The game’s outcome had effectively been determined when star Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels trotted out for another possession with 12 minutes remaining on Nov. 2.

Down 31 points to Seattle, Washington chose to keep Daniels, last season’s NFL offensive rookie of the year and the franchise’s cornerstone, in the game rather than sit him to avoid the risk of injury. Ten plays later, Daniels fell awkwardly on the elbow of his left, nonthrowing arm, dislocating it.

The drumbeat began as soon as Daniels started writhing on the turf. Sure, he was healthy. But why was he still in the game?

Less than a month later, the Commanders’ season now appears to be a lost cause. With their 3-8 record and less than a 1% chance of making the playoffs, according to one analysis, there’s a new question in Washington. Though Daniels could be healthy enough to return by early December, does that mean the team should let him take the field and again risk injury?

“You’re just got to try to do what’s best for the player,” Commanders coach Dan Quinn said this week. “We know what we’re looking to do and how we want to do it, but by no means are we careless about that. It’s important not just for Jayden, but important for our entire team.”

What is best, in Quinn’s view, is that Daniels continues to play, to benefit his long-term improvement. As Quinn said on Wednesday: “We would not put him out there if he’s not able to fully express who he is as a player.”

Daniels is one of the NFL’s most exciting young players, but not all Washington fans want to see him play again in these circumstances.

“We know what Jayden can do. We saw it last year and we’ve even seen it in games this year against the Chargers. He looked fantastic,” said Mark Manjardi, a lifelong fan of the franchise who was so dedicated he flew to Spain to watch the team face Miami in November, in a game Daniels missed.

“I just think the the worst-case scenario far, far, far outweighs the best-case scenario, which is, ‘Oh, he looks like his old self again,’ and we still have no chance of doing anything this year anyway. … Even if Jayden wants to play, which she obviously does, think long term. Think next year. This is a lost season. It sucks but it is what it is.”

The Commanders aren’t the only team who could, theoretically, place their franchise star in proverbial bubble wrap and tank the rest of the season with the aim of earning a better draft pick.

The practice is common late in NBA seasons by teams already far from playoff consideration. Though NBA teams do not explicitly say so, team executives, agents and players have long shared their belief that shelving a promising player for the remainder of a season often has more to do with improving a team’s odds of landing a high draft pick than it does with the severity of an injury.

NFL teams this season, however, seem to be deferring to players. Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a turf toe injury in Week 2 and missed the next nine weeks as his team cratered to a 3-8 record, with commentators making their case for why neither the Bengals, nor Burrow, were best-served by continuing to play him. Yet Burrow said returning on Thanksgiving would be meaningful to him.

“He’s a football player. He wants to play football,” Bengals coach Zac Taylor said earlier this week. “We want to win football games. That will lead into that decision.”

It’s safe to say the Bengals were glad they made the decision to start Burrow, who threw two touchdowns in Thursday’s 32-14 win against Baltimore.

Angst around the risk of Daniels hurting himself again has grown because his elbow dislocation was his third injury this season, after he previously missed three games for a sprained knee and tweaked hamstring.

Matthew Berry, a fantasy football expert for NBC Sports, posted on X, “begging my beloved Commanders. This is not our year. We should not risk further injury to our franchise QB in a lost year. He shouldn’t have been playing at the end of a blow-out loss and he shouldn’t play again this season. We are 3-8.”

Daniels isn’t wired that way, said Herm Edwards, the former NFL coach who also briefly coached Daniels in college at Arizona State.

“You’re going to have to tie him down for him not to play,” Edwards told a D.C. radio show recently. “You want a guy like that. If he would sit there and say, ‘Well, I’m done. We’re 3-8 now’ — that ain’t who he is.”

But, Edwards was pressed by a radio host: Should Daniels play when the playoff upside is so remote?

“The season is now, and he got to play now. Are you kidding me?” Edwards said. “That’s what they do. Football players play football. They don’t do anything else. That’s their job. He’s not going to say, ‘Hey man, you know’ — he don’t care. He wants to play, he wants to compete.”

Daniels confirmed that sentiment when telling reporters Tuesday, “If I’m healthy and ready to go, I want to be out there.”

Washington ranks in the league’s bottom half in sacks allowed. Its next two opponents, meanwhile — Denver and Minnesota — are known for harassing defenses to a degree that borders on maniacal. Denver, which faces Washington on Sunday, has 49 sacks, seven more than the league’s second-place team. The Vikings, who await on Dec. 7, blitz more often than anyone.

Still, Daniels could soon be suiting up again anyway. If, or when, that happens, some fans will be watching through their fingers.

What else we're watching for in Week 13

49ers (8-4) at Browns (3-8): Cleveland defensive end Myles Garrett is threatening to break the NFL’s single-season sack record of 22.5, with 18 sacks in just 11 games. Those 18 sacks are more than Carolina, San Francisco and Cincinnati have recorded as teams this season.

Jaguars (7-4) at Titans (1-10): Tennessee’s home losing streak currently sits at 10 games. Jacksonville is 5-1 against the Titans since 2022. If the No. 1 pick and Titans quarterback throws for multiple touchdowns Sunday, it would be the first instance of his career.

Texans (6-5) at Colts (8-3): The league’s No. 1 scoring offense (Colts, 31.0 points per game) faces the No. 2 scoring defense (Texans, 16.6 points per game). The Colts are 6-0 at home.

Saints (2-9) at Dolphins (4-7): Tua Tagovailoa’s 13 interceptions are one away from tying his career high. Miami’s last two opponents have been held to 13 points each.

Falcons (4-7) at Jets (2-9): New York is the first team in NFL history with one or fewer turnovers through 11 games in a season since turnovers were first tracked in 1933. Kirk Cousins is 8-8 as a Falcons starter since last season.

Cardinals (3-8) at Buccaneers (6-5): Tampa’s final six games are against teams that do not currently have a winning record. Cardinals tight end Trey McBride’s 301 career receptions are tied with Jimmy Graham for the most by a tight in their first four seasons in NFL history, per NBC Sports research.

Rams (9-2) at Panthers (6-6): The Rams own the best outright record in the NFC. Carolina has been outscored by 53 points in the aggregate, which is the worst mark by a .500-or-better team through 12 games since the 2019 Raiders, per NBC Sports research.

Vikings (4-7) at Seahawks (8-3): Seattle wideout Jaxon Smith-Njigba has a league-leading 1,313 receiving yards, which is only 290 yards fewer than the entire Jets roster. Minnesota’s three-game losing streak is one shy of its longest under coach Kevin O’Connell.

Bills (7-4) at Steelers (6-5): Josh Allen is 4-1 in his career against the Steelers. Buffalo, however, has failed to score 20 or more points in all three of its road losses.

Raiders (2-9) at Chargers (7-4): Raiders coach Pete Carroll has never lost six straight games in his career, but his current team is riding a five-game losing streak.

Broncos (9-2) at Commanders (3-8): Denver QB Bo Nix has five game-winning drives this season, tied with Chicago’s Caleb Williams for most in the league. Denver has won eight straight games while Washington has lost six consecutive.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251125-jayden-daniels-commanders-mn-1515-3468ca.jpg",N,,2025-11-29 11:01:59.225043

Hampton hasn't played since Week 5, when he suffered a left ankle fracture that landed him on injured reserve. Coach Jim Harbaugh said Hampton is ""on track"" to return but didn't specify when he'd return. ""Gosh, he looked good,"" Harbaugh said.

Hampton, who returned to practice Tuesday, said he felt ""amazing"" being back on the field. He was hopeful he'd play Sunday, but was leaving it up to the team's medical staff.

""It hurt kind of. Sitting here can't help my team,"" Hampton said. ""So, it's going to feel good to help my team out a little bit more.""

With Hampton out another game, the Chargers will again lean on running back Kimani Vidal. The Chargers released Vidal, their sixth-round pick in 2024, before roster cuts to 53 players. He returned to the practice squad and was signed to the active roster after the injuries to Hampton and running back Najee Harris.

Vidal, who had only 43 carries for 155 yards last season, has emerged as a ""No. 1 running back,"" according to Harbaugh. Vidal has two games over 100 rushing yards, and since Week 6, he has totaled 399 rushing yards, which ranks 17th in the NFL.

The Chargers took Hampton with the 22nd pick in April, and were hopeful that he and veteran Harris could form the rushing offense that Harbaugh had envisioned when he was hired.

Hampton had a slow start to the season but quickly became one of the Chargers' most important players after Harris sustained a season-ending Achilles rupture in the first half against the Denver Broncos in Week 3. With Harris down, L.A. leaned heavily on Hampton, who broke out with a team-high 129 yards from scrimmage and his first NFL touchdown in a 23-20 win.

Hampton had been a consistent, bruising force on the ground and a safety valve in the passing game for Herbert, catching 17 passes from Weeks 3 to 5, tied for second most on the team with wide receiver Keenan Allen. Hampton was also third in the NFL in yards from scrimmage (364) over that span.

The Seahawks are flying high in their first season quarterbacked by Sam Darnold, who signed a three-year, $100 million deal in free agency to replace Geno Smith.

Darnold inked that contract after reviving his career in Minnesota last season, during which he filled in for an injured J.J. McCarthy and led the Vikings back to the playoffs with a 14-3 record.

McCarthy, embattled in his second season in the league, hasn't cleared protocol yet after suffering a concussion in an embarrassing loss to the Green Bay Packers last week. So the Vikings are rolling with Max Brosmer under center. Minnesota plans to elevate John Wolford as Brosmer's backup Sunday, ESPN's Kevin Seifert reported Friday.

“Pleased with where he’s at,” Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell said of McCarthy Friday. “He’s progressing but just not able to clear the last few steps. Quite honestly, I have pretty strong feelings on just when guys do get a concussion and where they’re at in regards to the next week. Always want to leave it open to the doctors’ ultimate say and decision. And the protocol is in place for a reason.""

Brosmer, who played four seasons at the University of New Hampshire and one more at Minnesota to wrap up his college career, didn't hear his name called in this year's NFL Draft. The Vikings signed him as an undrafted free agent, and he raised eyebrows in the preseason, completing 35-of-58 passes for 364 yards, two touchdowns and an interception.

That three-outing run in August culminated in him operating the third-team Minnesota offense against the Tennessee Titans' starting defense. Brosmer thrived that day in Tennessee and clocked out 15 of 23 with 161 yards and a touchdown through the air.

After making the team, Brosmer sat behind McCarthy and Carson Wentz. He became Wentz's backup while McCarthy missed five games nursing a high ankle sprain. In relief of Wentz, Brosmer attempted passes in a blowout win over the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 3 and in a lopsided ""Thursday Night Football"" loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 8. He went a combined 5 of 8 with 42 passing yards.

But with Wentz out for the season with a shoulder injury, Brosmer moved into the No. 2 and now starting role, and the stakes are much higher.

""Max had a really good week of practice,"" O'Connell said Friday. ""His preparation started long before this week, with how he’s prepared being either a snap away or even throughout training camp and since he’s been here.

""I know the guys have a lot of confidence in him, and I’m very excited to see him play, based upon the work he’s put in and just how important I know this opportunity is to him. These guys are going to play great around him, and we’re going to go compete.""

Brosmer will be up against a Seahawks defense that's seventh in the NFL this season in fewest points per game allowed (19.7) and tied for second in fewest yards per play given up (4.6).

Still, he has an opportunity to spark a talented Vikings offense that's been stuck in neutral far too often this season.

""I made the comment that everyone’s an All-Pro when you’re not taking the reps,"" Brosmer said, when asked about preparing for his first start in the league, per The Minnesota Star Tribune's Ben Goessling.

Mikaela Shiffrin dominates the slalom, but in the fastest two of the four Alpine disciplines — downhill and super-G — Macuga has been the top American, surging into the spotlight in 2024-25. She posted her first World Cup victory in January, announcing herself as a major medal contender with the Olympics just a year away.

“I don’t even think the nerves have settled,” Macuga said after the race that day in St. Anton, Austria. “I can’t believe it. I’m just waiting for it to hit me, and I know it’s going to. It’s just so exciting. This is a dream.”

She went on to earn a bronze medal in the super-G at the world championships in February. She finished fourth in the World Cup downhill season standings and sixth in the super-G — the top American in each discipline, ahead of Lindsey Vonn and Breezy Johnson.

Vonn’s bid to return to the Olympics at age 41 has dominated the headlines, but Macuga was tracking to be the top U.S. medal hope at February’s Games in Cortina d’Ampezzo, Italy.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/28190357/GettyImages-2198321433-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-29 05:59:04.082638

“It’s a big relief,” Kerr said after Friday’s practice.
“You always worry when Steph goes down that it’s something that’s going to keep him out for a while.
Doing OK.” No matter how long Curry remains out, Kerr wants his team to focus on taking better care of the ball.
“We just have to keep taking care of the ball, or start taking care of the ball,” Kerr said.","SAN FRANCISCO — Steve Kerr and the Golden State Warriors are feeling a sense of ‘relief’ that Stephen Curry’s quad injury isn’t worse.

“It’s a big relief,” Kerr said after Friday’s practice. “You always worry when Steph goes down that it’s something that’s going to keep him out for a while. So, the fact that we’re taking it by the week and doesn’t appear to be anything too serious is a great sign. It gives us relief for sure.”

Curry injured his right quad late in the fourth quarter of Wednesday’s loss to the Houston Rockets and an MRI late Wednesday confirmed a quad contusion and muscle strain.

The Warriors announced Thursday that Curry would be re-evaluated in a week. Curry was back at practice on Friday to watch film with his teammates as he starts a rehab process that could have been worse if the MRI revealed something more severe.

“He’s feeling fine,” Kerr said. “He didn’t obviously do anything in practice today, but he’s here getting treatment and watched film with the guys. Doing OK.”

No matter how long Curry remains out, Kerr wants his team to focus on taking better care of the ball. Kerr has repeated the same mantra in recent weeks, given how closely it ties into the Warriors winning and losing games.

“We just have to keep taking care of the ball, or start taking care of the ball,” Kerr said. “It’s the same formula. Obviously we’re missing one of the great players of all time so maybe there’s a few more play calls. We’ve got to be extra sharp in our execution with our cutting and our passing, but it’s pretty obvious, 9-1 when we take care of the ball better than our opponents, 1-9 when we don’t. I’m going to keep hammering that point home to you guys, to our team, because it’s the No. 1 determining factor whether we win or lose.”

In the short term, without Curry, even more responsibility will be placed on third-year guard Brandin Podziemski. Podziemski comes into Saturday’s game against the New Orleans Pelicans averaging 12.2 points and 4.6 rebounds a game.

“We’re relying heavily on Brandin,” Kerr said. “He’s one of our most important players, and, obviously, Steph leaves a huge void. All of our guards have to be ready to fill in the gap.”

Speaking of those guards, Kerr said that veteran guard De’Anthony Melton is getting closer to a return as he continues his rehab from a left ACL tear suffered last season. Kerr said Melton went through all of Friday’s practice and there’s a ‘chance’ he plays on the upcoming three-game road trip.

“He’s getting a lot closer,” Kerr said of Melton. “I think the scrimmage the other day against the Santa Cruz team really helped and a full participant in practice. He won’t play on the remainder of this homestand, but he’ll go on the trip, and there’s a chance he’ll play on the trip.”

As for Jonathan Kuminga, Kerr is hopeful he’ll be able to make his return to the floor Saturday against the Pelicans. Kuminga has missed the last seven games because of bilateral knee tendonitis.

“He’ll be listed questionable,” Kerr said of Kuminga. “So, the training staff and JK will make that determination, but he’s a couple straight days, maybe three straight days, so trending upward.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/28172058/GettyImages-2248783210-1.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-29 04:57:56.160756

Seattle’s injury report released Friday afternoon has two players ruled out and another questionable. Everybody else on the active roster is ready to go.

Three numbers that matter as Seahawks’ JSN chases NFL history

One of the players ruled out is a bit of a blow: third-string running back George Holani will miss the 1:05 p.m. game Sunday with a hamstring injury that took him out of action during last week’s win at Tennessee.

The Seahawks seemed to have a good idea going into the week that Holani would be unavailable, as they signed former Los Angeles Rams and Vikings running back Cam Akers to the active roster on Wednesday.

The other player ruled out is rookie defensive end Rylie Mills, which is no surprise. The fifth-round NFL Draft pick out of Notre Dame has been out all year while recovering from an ACL injury suffered while still with the Fighting Irish and was just designated to return to practice for the first time this week.

The one Seahawks player ruled questionable for Sunday is safety Ty Okada, who has an oblique injury. He did not practice Wednesday and was limited in practice Thursday.

The injury report signals that the Seahawks will get starting linebackers Ernest Jones IV (knee) and Tyrice Knight (concussion) back after they both missed the win over the Titans due to injury.

Other players expected to play Sunday who were listed with injuries on the practice report this week are outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu (ankle), defensive end Mike Morris (knee), running back Kenneth Walker III (glute), wide receiver Cody White (abdomen) and guard Grey Zabel (knee).

As expected, Minnesota has ruled out quarterback J.J. McCarthy out for Sunday with a concussion. Guard Donovan Jackson (ankle) has also been ruled out.

Max Brosmer will start at QB for the Vikings, coach Kevin O’Connell announced Friday. John Wolford will come up from Minnesota’s practice squad to serve as the backup.

Arteta mentioned the possibility of a behind-closed-doors match to help Jesus get up to speed earlier this month, and in his pre-Chelsea press conference, he said: “It did happen.
“With Leo, there’s another test today,” said Arteta, who was speaking ahead the league leaders’ trip to second-placed Chelsea on Sunday.
We have to wait a bit longer for the scan to be precise on the timings, but I’m quite confident,” Arteta said.
I don’t know (if he will return before the new year) we have to wait and see.","Mikel Arteta has said that Gabriel Jesus is “very close” to an Arsenal return, but is cautious about how soon the Brazil forward is reintegrated into first team matches.

The 28-year-old has been out for 11 months after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury against Manchester United in January, but has stepped up his recovery in recent weeks.

Arteta mentioned the possibility of a behind-closed-doors match to help Jesus get up to speed earlier this month, and in his pre-Chelsea press conference, he said: “It did happen. Gabi (Jesus) participated.

“Ethan (Nwaneri) as well because he wanted some minutes, which we had an opportunity with different players who needed a bit of exposure and competition. It was very positive.”

Asked whether Jesus would need more internal matches or if the upcoming festive period, when Arsenal play nine games before the end of 2025, offers a chance to throw him straight in, the Arsenal manager added: “We have to see. He’s been out 11 months and you need that progression to see how his body and that knee reacts, and what else he needs.

“With the players that are available as well, it has to make sense with the balance of the squad. The good thing is it’s very close at the moment.

“It’s what we see every single day and how he reacts to the changes he had in load. Then he needs to get into the chemistry of the team, understanding the things in match-time which is very different to anything he tried to do in training. It’s about making those gaps as short as possible.”

Before his injury last season, Jesus scored six goals in four games around the turn of the year. Since then, Arsenal’s squad has changed in various ways, with eight summer signings and already existing players such as Mikel Merino being used in different roles.

Jesus has typically knitted together attacks for Arsenal when fit and, asked whether he still sees those qualities in the forward, Arteta said: “It’s always been one of Gabi’s qualities, the capacity to relate, connect and make other players better. He still has that and now he has to find a way to do it with some very new players.”

Fellow forward Leandro Trossard was forced off in the first half with a calf injury in Arsenal’s midweek win over Bayern Munich.

“With Leo, there’s another test today,” said Arteta, who was speaking ahead the league leaders’ trip to second-placed Chelsea on Sunday. “We have to see how he’s feeling. It doesn’t look much. It is a potential chance (he will be back)”

Arsenal are yet to have the results of scans for Gabriel Magalhaes, Viktor Gyokeres and Kai Havertz, but the Arsenal manager was optimistic about their respective recoveries.

“He (Gabriel) is evolving really well. We have to wait a bit longer for the scan to be precise on the timings, but I’m quite confident,” Arteta said.

“Especially the way Gabi takes every injury and the way he’s going to push everybody that it’s not going to be that long. I don’t know (if he will return before the new year) we have to wait and see.

“They (Gyokeres and Havertz) are getting closer and closer. We are very positive with both of them.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/28091928/GettyImages-2248370900-scaled-e1764339612620.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-29 02:57:58.863739

According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, an MRI confirmed that St. Brown suffered a low ankle sprain while blocking on a run play against the visiting Green Bay Packers. He will not need to be placed on injured reserve and figures to be out for a week or two, as Lions head coach Dan Campbell said Thursday.

With his condition now basically week-to-week, St. Brown will will have time to recover with the Lions playing just once — Dec. 4 against the Dallas Cowboys — over the next 16 days.

The injury occurred on the team's second drive of the day in a 31-24 defeat against the Packers. After going three-and-out on their first drive, the Lions took the field with 6:32 left in the first quarter. On the first play of the second drive, the Lions tried to run Jahmyr Gibbs to the right side.

St. Brown was a blocker on the play and tried to stop Packers safety Xavier McKinney from making a play. As the two were engaged, a Lions offense lineman rolled into St. Brown's legs. After staying down on the field for a moment, St. Brown limped off the field and went straight to the locker room.

The Lions initially deemed him questionable to return. Shortly after halftime, however, St. Brown was ruled out of the contest. He registered one target, but no catches, during the game.

With St. Brown, the Lions had to find other reliable pass catchers. For the most part, Jameson Williams stepped up, hauling in seven passes for 144 yards and a touchdown. Despite his efforts, the Lions couldn't complete the comeback against the Packers, losing 31-24.

The loss dropped the Lions to 7-5 on the season. While the team is very much in the playoff hunt, the loss could prevent them from winning the division. The Packers hold the edge in the head-to-head matchup this season, going 2-0 against the Lions in 2025.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8XCkYCFGRPzohqLvC2cdlQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-11/77913800-cc6e-11f0-bed4-14929d4bd4f4,N,,2025-11-29 09:57:42.831815

Maresca ruled out Chelsea’s chances of competing for the title 12 months ago when they had also climbed to second in the table.","Enzo Maresca has admitted everyone at Chelsea is excited at the prospect of Cole Palmer’s return after confirming he is ready to start against Arsenal on Sunday.

Palmer has not played for Chelsea since limping off against Manchester United in September, mainly due to a groin injury, but his comeback was also delayed by fracturing a toe in his left foot last week.

The England international has missed 13 games in all and head coach Maresca mentioned last Friday that he would not be ready to face Arsenal.

But today, however, he confirmed: “He’s available. Everyone is happy. The team-mates are happy. We are all happy and the most important thing is that Cole is happy because at the end, a football player, they want to play games and make sessions every day.

“What kind of contribution do I expect? A lot, a lot. He is probably our best player. We are happy that he is back. Now we need to give him time to be 100 per cent fit. He has done fantastic in the past and no doubt he is going to do very well for this club in the future.”

Estevao Willian has begun to star in Palmer’s absence with his fine goal in the 3-0 win against Barcelona making him just the third player to score in his first three Champions League games.

Asked about the prospect of opposition defenders worrying about the prospect of the duo soon being able to combine their talents together, Maresca replied: “They can play together. It depends on which team, it depends a little bit on the game plan, but for sure they are excited.

“The fans are excited to watch both together. We are also excited, thinking that at the end we need always a balance between the two phases.”

Chelsea go into the match against Arsenal with the chance to close the gap to the league leaders to three points with a victory. Maresca ruled out Chelsea’s chances of competing for the title 12 months ago when they had also climbed to second in the table. But while he insists it is too early to say they can challenge for the crown this time around, he does believe they are better equipped to do so than last year.

He added: “I think for sure it’s different compared to one year ago. It’s because we spent one more year together. We went through moments where we can learn from that moment. Then again, for me it’s very early. We are still at the end of November, December. So it’s very early and it’s important to be where we are now in March, April and then we’ll see.”

Chelsea have also been handed a boost with the news that midfielder Dario Essugo has returned to training.
