Q2 9:22 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

New England's momentum after the stop is quickly erased as Drake Maye is dropped by D.J. Jones on first-and-10 to start the possesion.

The second-year quarterback does not look comfortable yet.

I know Sean Payton likes to be aggressive. Remember the onside kick in Super Bowl XLIV?

But why the Broncos went for it on fourth-and-1 instead of taking the three points to take a two score lead boggles the mind.

Q2 9:22 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

Denver calls timeout ahead of the fourth-down attempt.

That play was destined for failure from the outset as the Broncos turn the ball over on downs. It was a play-action bootleg but two rushers immediately got after the quarterback and all the underneath throws were completely stifled, causing Jarrett Stidham to throw a dangerous ball intended for RJ Harvey that skipped incomplete.

That's a huge stand for New England and a moment to bookmark as this game unfolds.

Q2 10:11 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

A short run by RJ Harvey and a scramble by Jarrett Stidham for a couple set up third-and-6 in the red zone.

New England sends heat, and Stidham immediately takes off to his right, scampering for 5 yards to set up fourth-and-1.

Q2 12:17 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

That's a good ball by Jarrett Stidham to move the chains again on third down. He sat in the pocket and delivered a decisive ball to Lil'Jordan Humphrey on an out route for a gain of 3 yards.

Two players later, after a run by RJ Harvey and a powerful run by fullback Adam Prentice, Denver has another first down to New England's 23-yard line.

In three playoff games, the Patriots have a combined 7 points scored in the first quarter. Two of those three games, including today, they put zero on the board through one quarter.

New England starts slow. The Patriots haven’t been able to solve this Broncos defense yet though! By far the best defense they have faced in these playoffs.

End Q1 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

A run by Jaleel McLaughlin and a connection from Jarrett Stidham to Evan Engram give Denver a first down into New England territory as the first quarter comes to an end.

That is an encouraging first frame for Sean Payton and company.

Que Robinson, the rookie edge rusher who ripped down Drake Maye for a 9-yard sack to spoil New England's third drive, was only active in six games due to the regular season, biding his time behind a deep and healthy edge rush group.

The Broncos have raved about the progress of the fourth-round pick out of Alabama behind the scenes, and he demonstrated why on that play, rapidly closing the gap on Maye as the Patriots quarterback rolled to his right.

Pressure has been significant early for Denver's vaunted pass rush. Patriots have minus-2 net yards passing and 8 total yards on three drives.

Q1 0:54 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

The Broncos defense is balling right now!

On second-and-6, Drake Maye rolled out to his right on a bootleg but Que Robinson diagnosed the play perfectly, closed the gap and slung the quarterback down for a sack to set up third-and-15. Maye attempts to find Rhamondre Stevenson on a checkdown but fires wide as New England's offensive woes continue, leading to a punt.

A Denver score on this drive would apply a lot of pressure to this already sputtering unit.

It doesn’t look like Robert Spillane is returning any time soon.

After being looked at by trainers, the Patriots middle linebacker went and shook hands with fellow linebackers, then walked back to the locker room.

He’s the Patriots’ leading tackler and a huge part of the team’s defense.

Three Broncos drives and it’s evident Sean Payton is using a lot of motion with his offense. He also isn’t afraid to allow Jarrett Stidham to use his legs, as we saw on that designed QB run.

Stidham’s going to need to throw the ball if the Broncos want to win this game. But Denver is leaning on its balanced approach with run and pass plays to start.

Q1 2:28 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

An inside zone to RJ Harvey out of shotgun is blown up by New England for no gain, setting up third-and-9.

Jarrett Stidham drops back and puts a ball on the body of Courtland Sutton but the veteran wideout bobbles it before ultimately dropping it. Drops have been a problem for the veteran wideout all season and this is another example. It was not a perfect ball but certainly catchable.

Denver punts.

Q1 6:33 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

New England picks up a first down to start the drive but the possession fizzles out quickly after.

A screen to Stefon Diggs is blown up, followed by perfect coverage downfield from Pat Surtain on a deep ball intended for Kayshon Boutte. On third-and-12, Drake Maye finds Diggs underneath again but he is dropped after a gain of just 3 yards, leading to another Patriots punt.

Denver's defense has to put together a stellar performance here this afternoon and so far this unit appears up for the challenge.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/seBXB81yUtwW_S7sqXyqm0Sbb_1440x960.jpg",N,,2026-01-25 15:59:08.505274

New England is a 3.5-point favorite and is -205 on the Moneyline, while Denver is +170 to win outright on DraftKings Sportsbookopens in a new tab. The game total is set at 42.5 points.

Here are my top Kayshon Boutte prop bets for the AFC Championship Game.

Best Kayshon Boutte Prop Bets

Kayshon Boutte has played a big role in the postseason so far for the Patriots. Boutte was the deep threat for the team all season and led the team in yards per catch among players with at least 20 receptions. He ranked fifth on the team in receptions, but third on the team in receiving yards because of the number of deep balls that he caught. Against the Chargers in the Wild Card, Boutte had four catches for 66 yards. Then, against the Texans, he had three catches for 75 yards and a spectacular touchdown. As a deep-ball threat, Boutte plays a critical role for Drake Maye, but he has always been a boom-or-bust player.

My favorite Kayshon Boutte player prop is for him to have under 2.5 receptions. This Denver defense is one of the best in the league, having led the NFL in defensive dropback success rate during the regular season. The Broncos are good at taking away the deep shot, ranking fifth in the NFL in 20+ yard catches allowed. Boutte will either have to go up against Patrick Surtain II or Riley Moss in this game.

Surtain II is the best cover corner in the game. In 609 coverage snaps this season, he only gave up one 20+ yard catch, and that came on a shorter route after which the receiver broke a couple of tackles for a long gain. Surtain should completely take away Boutte when across from each other. When Boutte faces Riley Moss, Moss can match up with him as well. If Boutte ever beats Moss, he will take a penalty before giving up a long catch. The cornerback leads the NFL in defensive pass interference penalties this season. There is a chance that Boutte hits another deep ball or two in this game, but he should stay under 2.5 receptions against this elite secondary.",https://dknetwork.draftkings.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-2251889638.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 15:59:20.849165

Nix will watch the conference championship game from a luxury suite and is instructed to refrain from putting weight on his injured ankle for at least four weeks. He will not return to football activities for three months, and while that layoff will cost him a significant portion of the offseason, the expectation is that he will be mostly recovered in time to join the Broncos for OTAs and training camp.

WR Pat Bryant, Denver Broncos vs. NE ($4,400)

Lost in the shuffle of a dramatic Broncos win last week was the play of Pat Bryant. The wide receiver snagged three catches for 32 yards in the first quarter alone. However, a concussion moments later ended his day before halftime. That level of production, while a small sample size, is difficult to ignore. The rookie has come on strong in recent weeks, emerging as a reliable pass catcher for Denver. He’s tallied at least four receptions in four of his last six appearances. That includes last weekend’s injury-shortened outing vs. Buffalo.

Going up against a stout Patriots defense is a challenge on its own. Doing so with backup Jarrett Stidham ($4,500) under center makes things even more difficult. Regardless, that also increases the likelihood that the Broncos find themselves trailing. Should that occur, they’ll need to throw the ball more than usual. It’s also worth noting that New England has surrendered 17 touchdowns to wide receivers. That’s tied for the seventh-highest mark in football. Even if Bryant doesn’t reach the end zone, he should remain productive this afternoon.

RB George Holani, Seattle Seahawks vs. LAR ($4,000)

In a devastating blow for the Seahawks, Zach Charbonnet suffered a season-ending knee injuryopens in a new tab last Saturday vs. San Francisco. As a result, Kenneth Walker III ($6,200) is expected to gobble up most of the touches for Seattle. Still, there’s room for more than one running back to produce tonight. If anyone else is going to get some carries, it’s likely George Holani. The second-year pro has done most of his work on special teams. Still, through 11 games he’s recorded 24 touches for 88 total yards and a touchdown.

That’s not much of a track record to go off of, but it’s something. No other healthy running back besides Walker has handled more than five carries for Seattle. The Rams are no pushovers up front; at this point in the postseason, nobody is. Still, there should be some room to operate in the run game. In addition, Los Angeles has given up the NFL’s fifth-most receiving yards (650) to opposing running backs. Given the lack of low-cost options at the position, Holani could be a worthwhile dart throw.

TE Colby Parkinson, Los Angeles Rams at SEA ($3,500)

We’ll stay in the Pacific Northwest, where the Rams are hoping to pick up a road win. That won’t be easy against an elite Seahawks defense. This is a true battle of strength against strength; Seattle’s secondary vs. Los Angeles’ passing game. Quarterback Matthew Stafford ($6,300) has forged impressive connections with wideouts Puka Nacua ($9,000) and Davante Adams ($6,000). However, against a defense of this caliber, it’s unrealistic to expect both players to dominate. Should that occur, another target might emerge for LA.

The likeliest candidate would be Colby Parkinson. When healthy, the sixth-year pro has established himself as Los Angeles’ leading tight end. Through 15 games this season, the veteran has recorded 43 catches for 408 yards and eight touchdowns. If there’s any weakness on this Seahawks defense, its over the middle. Seattle is giving up the tenth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends. Parkinson has tallied at least 11.0 fantasy points in three of his last four outings. A similar showing on Sunday would be a welcome sight for fantasy managers.",https://dknetwork.draftkings.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-2247620782.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 14:59:27.286350

Darnold reportedly split time with backup Drew Lock in practice during the week. The Seahawks were careful with the starter, not allowing Darnold to throw it deep in practices. The quarterback is reportedly saving those types of throws for Sunday's game, per Schefter.

Darnold attempted only short and medium throws at practice and did not, as one source described, ""let it rip."" He is saving that level of throwing effort for Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Rams.

The 28-year-old Darnold initially sustained the injury ahead of the team's divisional round game against the San Francisco 49ers. Despite the injury, Darnold was able to play against the 49ers, where he helped lead the team to a dominant 41-6 win.

Darnold wasn't asked to do much in the victory. With the Seahawks jumping out to a 17-0 lead in the first quarter, Darnold threw the ball only 17 times throughout the contest. After the Seahawks essentially clinched the game, Lock came on in relief of Darnold. Lock, however, did not throw a pass during the contest.

While it's unclear how Darnold will respond if pushed into more action against the Rams on Sunday, the quarterback plans to take a pain-killing injection prior to the game, per Schefter. He did the same thing before the team's divisional round game and it helped.

All signs point to Stidham being the Broncos starting quarterback for the remainder of the season.

Here’s what you need to know about Nix’s injury.

Bo Nix’s Injury: Here’s What Happened to the Broncos QB & Potential Return Timeline

Broncos head coach Sean Payton revealed that Nix sustained the injury on the second to last offensive play during Denver’s win over Buffalo. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Nix’s return timeline in 12 weeks, which cements his status as out, even if the Broncos reach the Super Bowl.

“Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, who is out for Sunday’s AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots, is expected to be sidelined 12 weeks after undergoing surgery last week on his broken right ankle, sources told ESPN,” Schefter detailed in a January 25, 2026, story titled, “Sources: Broncos’ Bo Nix sidelined 12 weeks after ankle surgery.”

“The recovery, not the surgery, is thought to be the most challenging part of this injury. Nix is not supposed to put any weight on his ankle for at least four weeks, and he will miss 12 weeks altogether before he can return to activity, according to sources.”

Will Bo Nix Play in the Super Bowl if the Broncos Defeat the Patriots in the AFC Championship?

Nix will not play in the AFC Championship or the Super Bowl (if Denver advances), but it is not all bad news. If Schefter’s timeline comes to fruition, Nix will be more than ready for the start of next NFL season.

This also means Nix should be healthy for Denver’s offseason workouts. Stidham is expected to serve as Denver’s starting quarterback for the remainder of the season. Broncos fans hope this also means the Super Bowl.

It is surprising news as Nix was not sidelined during the Broncos’ win over the Bills. Nix participated in a postgame interview, and Payton also conducted his normal press conference.

Minutes later, Payton called an impromptu second press conference revealing that Nix sustained a season-ending injury and named Stidham the starter moving forward.

“I know how he was coached in New England,” Payton said of Stidham, per ESPN. “I know exactly how he was coached in New England.

“And then I know how [Patriots offensive coordinator Josh] McDaniels felt about him … but ultimately … it’s our three years here, our three years watching him day in and day out.

McGinn had undergone scans in the past week to learn the extent of the injury after being forced off in the 31st minute in Villa’s 1-0 defeat to Everton last Sunday.

While Villa waited for a prognosis for the Scotland international, they moved to help bolster midfield and wide areas, with Leon Bailey returning from his loan spell at AS Roma and Harvey Elliott being recalled to the squad for the trip to Newcastle United on Sunday.

Provided the outlined timeframe is followed, McGinn should have recovered in time for the World Cup, which Scotland will be playing in for the first time in 28 years.

The 31-year-old, though, will miss a crucial run of fixtures for his club side, particularly with injuries mounting in midfield.

Boubacar Kamara has been ruled out for the remainder of the campaign, while Ross Barkley has not yet returned to full training.

This has influenced Villa to assess the transfer window and possible midfield loan options. Ruben Loftus-Cheek is among a list of players being considered, but will also depend on how much financial scope Villa have to do business, in light of ongoing restrictions.

The recovery, not the surgery, is thought to be the most challenging part of this injury. Nix is not supposed to put any weight on his ankle for at least four weeks, and he will miss 12 weeks altogether before he can return to activity, according to sources.

This eliminates any notion, far-fetched as it was, that Nix could somehow pull a miraculous return for the Feb. 8 Super Bowl LX in the event that Denver does advance.

During Sunday's AFC Championship Game at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, Nix will be in a box with other injured Broncos, off his feet as doctors have instructed him to be.

Nix is expected to be largely recovered in time to participate in the Broncos' offseason program, but doctors are trying to be very intentional with what Denver's quarterback can and can't do over the next 12 weeks.

Nix suffered the injury late in overtime of the Broncos' victory over the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round. Broncos coach Sean Payton delivered the news in the aftermath of the game and immediately named Jarrett Stidham as the starting quarterback for the AFC Championship Game.

This marks the third time that Nix has broken his ankle playing football, but this break was in a different spot and doctors have told him that the injury is ""nothing to be concerned about long term,"" according to a source.

In the short term, the Broncos are replacing Nix with Stidham, who was the first free agent that Payton signed after he accepted Denver's head coaching job.

""I'm not worried about Stiddy in this game,"" Payton told reporters Friday. ""I'm worried about everyone else and how we play. That really is the truth.""

Broncos Country also has publicly backed Stidham, with thousands of fans changing their social media avatars to photos of Stidham wearing sunglasses and earbuds. The picture is visible this week all over social media.

But while Stidham makes his first start of the season, Nix will miss the AFC Championship Game and a showdown against his good friend and quarterback draft classmate Drake Maye. The two quarterbacks have spent countless hours training together during the offseason, largely at Philip Rivers' training complex in Fairhope, Alabama.

After undergoing that surgery, the quarterback is expected to miss 12 weeks, per ESPN's Adam Schefter. Nix reportedly will not be allowed to be any weight on his ankle for four weeks. If he recovers well, the earliest he can begin activity would be right around the 12-week mark.

Though it's going to be a lengthy recovery, Nix is expected to be ""largely recovered"" in time for the team's offseason workouts, per Schefter.

Nix has reportedly broken his ankle three times during his football career, though this break is in a different area and should not affect the quarterback long term. Nix has gotten off to a promising start in his career, and threw for 3,931 yards, with 25 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, during his second season in the NFL. His performance, combined with the Broncos' excellent defense, resulted in Denver winning the No. 1 seed in the AFC.

Seattle also activated running back George Holani off injured reserve on Friday.

Brock: Seahawks must speed up Stafford to slow down Rams

Holani, Jones and Akers give the Seahawks a trio of options behind top running back Kenneth Walker III in the wake of Zach Charbonnet’s season-ending injury. Charbonnet, the team’s second-leading rusher, suffered a torn ACL in last weekend’s 41-6 divisional round rout of the San Francisco 49ers.

Jones, a fourth-year pro who signed with Seattle’s practice squad midway through the season, rushed for 32 yards on four carries in three regular-season games. He was elevated from the practice squad for the divisional round game and ran for 10 yards on six carries after Charbonnet went down.

Akers, a sixth-year pro, signed with the Seahawks in late November after being released by the Minnesota Vikings. He spent his first three-plus seasons with the Rams, finishing as their leading rusher in both 2020 and 2022. He has no carries with Seattle this season, but had two kick returns for 54 yards in a Week 17 win over the Carolina Panthers.

Holani, an undrafted second-year pro out of Boise State, had been on IR since suffering a hamstring injury in Week 12. Prior to that, he spent the first 11 games as Seattle’s third-string running back behind Walker and Charbonnet. Holani rushed for 73 yards and a TD on 22 carries, while adding two catches for 15 yards and 16 kick returns for 387 yards.

Walker rushed for a team-high 1,027 yards and five touchdowns in the regular season, then ran for 116 yards and three TDs in the Seahawks’ playoff rout of the 49ers. Charbonnet rushed for 730 yards and a team-high 12 TDs in the regular season.

In the NFL, players such as Green Bay Packers wide receiver Romeo Doubs wear the guardian cap in the game.
It can be harder at the high school level, where parents are much more involved.
Former NFL players such as Aaron Hernandez, the former UF and New England Patriots tight end, have been found to have had CTE.
The NFL making these choices has had a trickle-down effect to lower levels of football, from college to high school and beyond.","The scariest injury in football isn’t a torn anterior cruciate ligament or a ruptured Achilles. Instead, it is an injury that is not always even seen. There is nothing in football that can compare to a concussion.

A concussion occurs when the brain moves rapidly back and forth in the skull, usually after a hit or collision. In football, there are hits every single play, bringing the risk of a concussion even higher. Sometimes it is clear a concussion has occurred, such as when Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was left twitching on the field in Week 4 of the 2022 season. Other times it is not as clear and a player may remain in the game.

The NFL has begun to be more proactive when it comes to concussions. It has implemented things such as the guardian cap, which is a protective cover over the helmet, as well as changing kickoff rules to avoid unnecessary high speed collisions.

So far, it is working. The NFL reported a drop in total concussions in 2024, going from 219 in 2023 to just 182 in 2024, per Kevin Seifert of ESPN. The biggest change came from regular-season games, where the concussion numbers went from 152 to 129.

I had the opportunity to talk with former offensive lineman and current high school football coach at Land O’ Lakes high school Dan Goodspeed, as well as Ben Fisher, an intern athletic trainer at the University of Florida, to learn more about concussions in football. Goodspeed was a member of the 2003 Super Bowl winning Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Rub Some Dirt on it

Goodspeed played offensive line in the NFL from 2001-2005 and spent time in the CFL and XFL up until 2012. “It was a very different time for concussions,” he said.

While Goodspeed was knocked out on the field multiple times, there was not a concussion diagnosis that followed. Instead, he would receive smelling salts to wake up and be sent back out.

There was the expectation that a player would be on the field, and, if you were missing time for a concussion that meant your job was in jeopardy.

As an offensive lineman, Goodspeed had more of his head injuries coming from getting kneed in a pile rather than hitting the ground. He theorized that quarterbacks have a higher concussion rate in the regular season because they are not taking hits in practice like everyone else.

When it comes to why the concussions rate is higher in preseason, especially preseason practices, Goodspeed pointed out those practices are harder, as well as the fact that there are young players who want to earn a roster spot. These young players are hitting like it is a real game to show they have what it takes, while also being more reckless to do everything they can to achieve the dream of playing in the NFL.

All levels of football have begun to implement the guardian caps, and the data is supporting their continued use. Goodspeed, who still receives information from the NFL Players Association, passed along that the data given shows “it (guardian caps) does help.”

Goodspeed has all of his high school players wear the guardian caps. He wants the parents of his players to know that he has the safety of players in the forefront of his mind, and is taking every step to keep them healthy.

At the high school level players’ brains are still developing, which makes a concussion have even worse effects. The guardian caps are a step to mitigate the concern.

The Gators are also taking concussions seriously. While tight end Tony Livingston became the first UF player to wear the guardian cap in game, Fisher reported that all players wear them in practice. Working to decrease the risk of a concussion in practice is an easy step many college programs are taking.

In the NFL, players such as Green Bay Packers wide receiver Romeo Doubs wear the guardian cap in the game. The response by the fans was interesting. When Doubs first wore the cap, fans on social media had a field day making fun of the way it looked. But now, it is talked about less and less, which is a win for all the guardian cap supporters.

You Have a Concussion, Now What?

Concussion protocol has taken strides in the direction of player safety. The one thing that remains constant, and will likely never change, is that concussion treatment depends on a strong relationship between player and coaching staff.

The return from concussion protocol “requires honesty from the athletes” according to Fisher. The medical team cannot see inside the mind of players and know how their head feels. A positive relationship with the coaching staff allows a player to wait until they feel healthy before returning to play.

This is the type of environment Goodspeed has tried to create at Land O’ Lakes. It can be harder at the high school level, where parents are much more involved. Many parents grew up in the same era Goodspeed did, where concussions were not treated as a serious issue.

There are times where the parents will encourage their son to get back on the field, and tell the coach they are healthy when they are not.This is where things such as the concussion test come in. Players at the beginning of the season take the test to generate a baseline score, and then will take the test again if a concussion is suspected. While not perfect, it allows another check on what could be a dangerous head injury.

There are ways the athletes are able to stay in shape while sidelined with a concussion. Players can do activities such as running on the treadmill, and also begin other rehab activities as time goes by, according to Fisher.

Something to watch long term after a concussion is the onset of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, more commonly known as CTE. While it has recently become the subject of jokes across media, it is a serious condition which can be caused by traumatic brain injuries, such as concussions.

CTE is particularly scary because it takes impact years after the head injury has occurred, and cannot be detected until after death. Former NFL players such as Aaron Hernandez, the former UF and New England Patriots tight end, have been found to have had CTE. By taking steps to increase player safety in the realm of concussion, the NFL is hoping to cut down on players being found to have had CTE after death.

The NFL making these choices has had a trickle-down effect to lower levels of football, from college to high school and beyond. The NFL’s continued commitment to combatting concussions is admirable, and to look back at how far it has come since the early 2000s gives hope to the future stars.",https://www.wruf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/USATSI_27658777-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 13:00:28.068910

They’re going to need to step up in the Premier League, though, as a top-five finish is not guaranteed in this type of form.
“We’re the only team who played Champions League that has only two days in-between.","Liverpool suffered a last-gasp defeat at Bournemouth, having earlier coming from 2-0 down to level the game thanks to an improved second-half showing.

Goals from Virgil van Dijk and Dominik Szoboszlai brought the Premier League champions level, but with the final stages of the game particularly end-to-end, it was the hosts who bundled in a dramatic later winner through Amine Adli.

It is Arne Slot’s side’s seventh league defeat of the season, and their fifth league match without a win.

The Athletic’s Gregg Evans assesses the action…

Just how damaging is this for Liverpool?

Forget the 13-game unbeaten run coming to an end.

The most significant statistic is that Liverpool have now failed to win any of their last five Premier League games.

That is made worse by the level of opponent: Bournemouth, Burnley, Arsenal, Fulham and Leeds United. For the Premier League champions to be so poor over that period is both shocking and surprising. And although this was the first defeat, the disappointing draws of previous weeks felt just as bad.

Slot has shared supporters’ frustrations in recent times, admitting that results against lower-placed teams have not been acceptable.

Injuries have certainly played a part and Liverpool’s rotten run of luck shows no sign of ending. They were a man down in defence and while trying to make a substitution to replace the injured Joe Gomez, they conceded the second goal. With literally the last kick of the game they painfully conceded again.

But the bottom line is that the team has not performed well enough when it matters, and victories have been so hard to come by.

Whether that’s through missing big chances or individual errors like Van Dijk’s costly mistake today, the shortcomings have resulted in a weak defence of the title. But the season is far from over, and Liverpool appear to be better suited to European football and their Champions League adventure is still alive and kicking.

They’re going to need to step up in the Premier League, though, as a top-five finish is not guaranteed in this type of form.

Is Szoboszlai now Liverpool’s main man?

Szoboszlai is quickly turning into Liverpool’s main man. He pushed and probed and almost became the saviour.

The Hungarian, who is in talks with the club about extending his contract, provided a goal and an assist and was once again the leading force as he mixed guts with guile in tricky conditions.

His attacking moments will stand out, especially the equalising strike from another free-kick (this time with a little help from Alexis Mac Allister who rolled the ball into his path) but his driving runs in midfield and all-action performance was worth so much more, even in defeat.

On one occasion where Liverpool lost possession in a dangerous area, it was Szoboszlai who raced back and charged into a tackle to cut out the counter-attack.

His pinpoint corner before half time was perfectly-weighted and allowed Van Dijk to head home. Then, late into the second half, he smashed in the equaliser, just days after scoring the opening from a free-kick against Marseille. It looked to have salvaged a point.

Ultimately it was not to be, but that wasn’t down to Szoboszlai. There’s a reason that he plays almost every minute as his status in this team continues to grow. It’s been a wild month with errors against Barnsley in the FA Cup and then the missed penalty against Burnley last weekend, but in the days that have followed he’s done everything in his powers to make amends.

How unlucky is Joe Gomez?

Injury-prone Gomez lasted just 27 minutes on his first start in the Premier League at centre-back for 13 months, leaving Liverpool significantly short on numbers in defence.

With Ibrahima Konate granted additional time off following the passing of his father, Gomez continued to fill in alongside Van Dijk and was playing well until another cruel setback.

In the build-up to Bournemouth’s opening goal, the defender collided with goalkeeper Alisson and was forced off injured.

That left Liverpool with Van Dijk as the only available centre-back, as makeshift stopper, Wataru Endo, was called upon from the bench for his first Premier League minutes in seven weeks.

Keeping Gomez fit has been a troublesome task for years and this felt particularly harsh. He was handling the demands just fine until the setback and now he will be assessed to see the extent of the damage.

What also makes the injury so disappointing was that the last time he started in his favoured position away at West Ham United in December 2024, he was also forced off through injury in the first half. The amount of minutes he’s missed through injury is heartbreaking, and at a time where Liverpool really needed him in Konate’s absence, his body again let him down.

What did Slot say?

“It’s frustrating, conceding a goal with no time left is always frustrating. They could have scored earlier.

“It’s safe to say we had a few players who ran out of energy. I cannot even criticise them for that because two days ago we had an away game in Europe.

“We’re the only team who played Champions League that has only two days in-between. I mainly played the same players because of the amount that we have available. Then you have to go and win in the end. That’s then more difficult. The rest of the game was completely different, we dominated.”

What next for Liverpool?",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/24143607/GettyImages-2257980981-scaled-e1769283391722.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-25 13:00:32.304490

Miami is expected to promote senior passing game coordinator Bobby Slowik to be its next offensive coordinator, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Saturday afternoon.

Slowik, 38, joined the Dolphins in the 2025 offseason after he served the previous two seasons as the Houston Texans offensive coordinator.

During his time as the OC in Houston, Slowik helped Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud to a stellar rookie season in 2023, leading to an AFC South division title, a Divisional Round appearance and an Offensive Rookie of the Year award for Stroud. Slowik called plays for a top-12 overall unit and seventh-ranked passing offense in 2023.

In his second season with the Texans, Slowik's offense took a dip with injuries piling up on the offensive line and inconsistent play from Stroud. Houston dropped to 22nd in total yards per game and 21st in passing, which led to his firing.

New Dolphins head coach Jeff Hafley hopes Slowik can bring the same success he saw in Year 1 with Stroud. The Dolphins currently are evaluating the quarterback position after Tua Tagovailoa was benched late in the 2025 season by former head coach Mike McDaniel.

Tagovailoa, who signed a four-year, 212.4 million contract extension in July 2024, could be looking for a fresh start elsewhere with a new regime in Miami.

Rookie Quinn Ewers showed some flashes while starting the last three games of the season, but with a new front office and head coach, the Dolphins could look to add a veteran QB this offseason or select a rookie in the 2026 NFL Draft in April.

Miami has solid a piece for Slowik to scheme around in running back De’Von Achane, who recently earned his first Pro Bowl honor. However, the Dolphins' receiving corps took a step back and has some uncertainties in the wake of Tyreek Hill suffering a season-ending knee injury in September.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/kjda7pvx1h0serm7pd8s,N,,2026-01-25 12:01:41.052475

They activated wide receiver Mack Hollins from injured reserve Saturday after he missed Weeks 17 and 18 and their pair of opening postseason games with an abdomen injury, giving star quarterback Drake Maye another key wideout in addition to Stefon Diggs and Kayshon Boutte.

At the time of his injury, Hollins had collected the third-most receptions (46) and the fourth-most receiving yards (550) on the Patriots — putting him in position to potentially surpass his previous career-bests of 57 and 690, respectively, from 2022 when he was with the Raiders.

The abdominal injury occurred during the Patriots’ Week 16 win over the Ravens, when Hollins caught seven passes for 69 yards.

Hollins, Maye said, has been “awesome” for the Patriots, while head coach Mike Vrabel, according to ESPN, told reporters that Hollins “has an energy to him.”

“It’s been awesome having him back,” Maye told reporters Friday, according to MassLive. “He’s a great player for us, been a great player for us all year. He practices hard. He’s one of those guys that brings it every day and has ever since I met him. I know he started off in OTAs and training camp battling a little injury, but since then, he’s been all gas, no brakes, and that’s how he is.

“He’s staying, running routes after practice. He’s doing all the little things. I always see him before the games on Saturday nights, drawing every single play up in the pass plays. He does those things, and you can tell why so many different teams wanted him and how he plays at a high level.”

With a win Sunday against the Broncos and backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham, Hollins would secure a spot in the second Super Bowl of his career, and this time, it’d come with the Patriots team he — and the Eagles — defeated in February 2018.

On Saturday, the Patriots activated WR Mack Hollins (abdomen) from injured reserve and elevated RB D'Ernest Johnson and DT Leonard Taylor III from the practice squad for Sunday's championship game. Hollins is set to make his return from a four-game absence after sustaining an injury in the Patriots Week 16 win over the Ravens. To make room for Hollins on the 53-man roster, the Patriots placed DT Eric Gregory on injured reserve. Gregory was inactive for the first two playoff games, with Taylor getting the nod to provide depth on the interior defensive line.

Starting with the Patriots offense, Hollins should provide a huge boost to the Patriots offense for the AFC Championship Game. Before his injury, the veteran led all Patriots wideouts in snaps (657), was third on the team in receptions (46), and fourth in receiving yards (550). Along with being a quarterback-friendly target for Drake Maye, Hollins was a key piece in New England's run game, allowing the Patriots to run effectively out of their three-receiver groupings because Hollins (6-4, 221) can block like a tight end.

Hollins often blocks linebackers and safeties at the point of attack in the run game, aligning on the wing or in the slot. On top of having good size and versatility, Hollins still has the play speed of a wide receiver, making the Patriots three-receiver sets more dynamic than their heavy groupings. Hollins' production might not jump off the page, but the flexibility that he brings to the table was part of the reason why the Patriots led the NFL in offensive efficiency during the regular season (first in EPA per play). Plus, the veteran is a trusted pass-catcher, using his catch radius and savvy to be a friendly target for Maye, especially over the middle of the field.

As for the Patriots practice squad elevations, New England is sticking with the same script as its first two playoff games. Johnson has been elevated from the practice squad to serve as the third back and a kickoff returner, while Taylor has been active as the fifth option in the Patriots defensive tackle rotation. Despite only playing 14 snaps last week, Taylor logged two hurries in New England's divisional round win over the Texans – solid production for a depth player.

Although they're both eligible to be activated at any time, the Patriots opted to not activate RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) or DT Joshua Farmer (hamstring) from injured reserve this week. Jennings began practicing on Jan. 14, giving the Patriots until Feb. 4 to activate the first-year running back before his 21-day window expires (the week of the Super Bowl). Farmer just began practicing this past week on Wednesday, so his window will remain open through the Super Bowl. For now, New England will continue to roll with Johnson and Taylor as RB3/KR and DT5.

With a full 53-man roster and two practice-squad elevations, the Patriots game-day roster is at 55 players. New England will need to declare seven inactives 90 minutes before kickoff. The question is whether they'll need an additional edge rusher without captain Harold Landry III (knee, out) and if there's a game-day spot for a sixth wide receiver now that Hollins is expected to return. Perhaps that last game-day active spot would go to rookie OLB Bradyn Swinson instead of rookie WR Efton Chism III. Another option would be to lean on hybrid LB Jahlani Tavai as depth on the edge, rather than making Chism inactive, who could be helpful if Hollins has any limitations in his return.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/bzpgd8qnwdpfmclsinoi,N,,2026-01-25 12:01:49.739587

Here's the latest update on the Broncos' young gunslinger as they prepare for their first AFC title game in a decade:

NFL NEWS, TAKES, FANTASY ADVICE: USA TODAY Sports has you covered with our NFL vodcast

When will Bo Nix return?

Nix's season is over. The Broncos' quarterback broke a bone in his right ankle in the final moments of Denver's overtime win against the Bills in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs.

ESPN's Adam Schefter reported Sunday, Jan. 25, that Nix is expected to be sidelined 12 weeks after undergoing surgery last week on his ankle.

Broncos head coach Sean Payton said Nix broke his ankle late in overtime, on the play before the quarterback threw a pass to receiver Marvin Mims. NFL Media's Tom Pelissero reported that the injury occurred on a first-and-10 play, when Nix rolled out to his left on an apparent designed quarterback run.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/n0f6IS7S_j4JpA8bc6R16g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04Mzc7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_sports_articles_558/40840ef1e285ca4c80fcbce7e95d722e,N,,2026-01-25 12:02:06.786789

And after splitting a pair of epic regular-season showdowns, the bitter NFC West rivals always seemed destined for a Round 3.

Seahawks-Rams Details: TV, radio and more for NFC Championship

That high-stakes rubber match will take place in Sunday afternoon’s NFC Championship, with the top-seeded Seahawks (15-3) hosting the fifth-seeded Rams (14-5) at Lumen Field for a spot in the Super Bowl.

The Rams won these teams’ first encounter in Week 11, intercepting Sam Darnold four times in a 21-19 win at SoFi Stadium. The Seahawks returned the favor in improbable fashion in Week 16, rallying from a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit for a stunning 38-37 overtime victory at Lumen Field.

The combined score of those two matchups? Rams 58, Seahawks 57.

And the combined total yardage? Rams 830, Seahawks 829.

Yes, the difference between these two juggernauts has been that razor-tight.

As kickoff approaches, let’s take a closer look at Seahawks-Rams, Part III.

The injury situation

Both teams are pretty healthy for this late in the season.

Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold (oblique) and left tackle Charles Cross (foot) were both on the injury report this week, but both are considered good to go for Sunday. Cross didn’t play in the Week 16 matchup, so that could be a boost for Seattle.

However, the Seahawks will be without second-leading rusher Zach Charbonnet, who suffered a season-ending torn ACL in last weekend’s divisional round. George Holani, Velus Jones Jr. and Cam Akers are all options to fill the void behind leading rusher Kenneth Walker III.

Seahawks injury report | Rams injury report

Rams edge rusher Byron Young (knee), who had a team-high 12 sacks in the regular season, is questionable but expected to play.

Meanwhile, several Rams who missed the Week 16 matchup will be on the field this time around: six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Davante Adams, right guard Kevin Dotson, tight end Tyler Higbee and safety Quentin Lake.

Adams hauled in a league-high 14 touchdown catches this season, including a 1-yard TD against Seattle in the Week 11 matchup. However, the Seahawks otherwise did a good job of keeping him in check, as that was Adams’ lone reception of the game.

The big storyline: Turnovers

One of the few major differences between these teams in the first two matchups? The Rams’ 7-1 advantage in the turnover margin.

Turnovers were the story in Week 11, as the Rams’ defense flustered Darnold into a nightmare four-interception performance. Seattle actually outgained the Rams 414-249 that afternoon, but a 4-1 turnover deficit was simply too much to overcome.

Turnovers were also nearly the story in Week 16, as the Seahawks lost the turnover battle 3-0 after two more Darnold interceptions and a Cooper Kupp fumble. If not for the largest fourth-quarter comeback in franchise history, Seattle would have been ruing those costly mistakes.

Needless to say, the Seahawks can’t afford to go minus-3 in the turnover margin again.

As such, all eyes will be on Darnold to see if he can avoid the big mistakes. Seattle’s QB1 committed a league-high 20 turnovers (14 interceptions, six fumbles) in the regular season. And in his past three matchups against the Rams – including a wild-card playoff loss with the Minnesota Vikings last season – he’s combined for just two touchdown passes and eight turnovers.

On the flip side, though the traditional stats don’t show it, Rams star quarterback and MVP front-runner Matthew Stafford has flirted with danger this season. Though Stafford committed just 12 turnovers in 19 total regular-season and postseason games, he’s been attributed by Pro Football Focus with 25 turnover-worthy plays. Darnold, by contrast, has 19 turnover-worthy plays.

In essence, Darnold has paid the price for putting the ball in compromising situations, while Stafford has had favorable luck due to opponents dropping would-be interceptions and fumbles ending up in his teammates’ hands.

Stafford has really been living on the edge lately, logging 15 turnover-worthy plays over his past six games. That includes six turnover-worthy plays over the Rams’ two playoff games, despite only one of those plays actually resulting in a turnover.

If Darnold takes better care of the ball and Stafford’s turnover luck runs out against Seattle’s vaunted defense, the Seahawks could flip the script on Sunday.

Seahawks defense vs. Rams offense

The Seahawks have the NFL’s top-ranked scoring defense, led by one of the league’s brightest defensive minds in head coach Mike Macdonald.

The Rams have the NFL’s top-ranked scoring offense, led by Stafford and one of the league’s brightest offensive minds in head coach Sean McVay.

It’s a true heavyweight clash between two of the NFL’s top units and two of the league’s most cutting-edge play-callers.

In Week 11, Macdonald’s defense had its way. Despite losing 21-19, the Seahawks limited the Rams to just 249 total yards, their second-lowest output of the season. They held Stafford to a season-low 130 passing yards and just 4.6 yard per pass attempt, the latter of which was the lowest mark of his entire 83-game tenure with the Rams.

But in the Week 16 rematch, the roles were reversed. The Seahawks rallied for a wild 38-37 overtime win, but their defense struggled mightily while allowing a franchise-record 581 total yards. Stafford threw for a whopping 457 yards – including 225 to star wideout Puka Nacua – and gashed Seattle’s vaunted defense with four completions of 40-plus yards. To put that in perspective, the Seahawks allowed just three 40-plus-yard completions over their other 17 games combined.

So, what was the difference between those two dramatically different outcomes?

One key factor was the amount of pressure Seattle’s pass rush generated. Though the Seahawks didn’t sack Stafford in either game, they were able to force him into more of a dink-and-dunk approach in the first matchup.

During that Week 11 clash, Stafford’s average time to throw was 2.46 seconds, which was his third-fastest mark of the season, according to PFF. As a result, he barely attacked downfield, finishing just 2 of 5 for 31 yards on throws that were targeted 10-plus yards past the line of scrimmage.

On the flip side, Stafford’s 2.82-second average time to throw in the Week 16 matchup was his fourth-longest mark of the season. With more time to attack the intermediate to deep areas of Seattle’s defense, he went 10 of 20 for 322 yards on passes 10-plus yards downfield.

If the Seahawks’ pass rush can speed up Stafford like it did in Week 11, that’d go a long way to helping slow down the Rams’ high-powered attack.

Seahawks offense vs. Rams defense

The Rams’ defense has been trending in the wrong direction.

Over the first 12 weeks of the season, Los Angeles allowed just 16.3 points per game and ranked No. 1 in defensive EPA, according to RBSDM.com. But from Week 13 through the divisional round of the playoffs, the Rams surrendered 26.9 points per game and ranked 18th in defensive EPA.

Shaky cornerback play has been a major culprit. Since Week 13, Rams cornerbacks Emmanuel Forbes Jr. and Cobie Durant have combined to allow 667 passing yards and nine touchdowns, according to PFF. L.A.’s run defense has been leakier as well, plummeting from seventh in yards allowed per attempt (3.9) over the first 10 weeks to 24th (4.6) since Week 11.

Meanwhile, Seattle’s offense found a run-pass balance down the stretch.

Over the first half of the season, Darnold and NFL receiving leader Jaxon Smith-Njigba torched opposing defenses with an explosive passing attack. But the Seahawks’ ground game lagged behind, ranking 31st in yards per carry (3.7) and 27th in rushing EPA over the first nine weeks.

Midway through the season, defenses began placing a greater emphasis on taking away big plays over the top. As a result, the Seahawks’ passing attack became much less explosive. But in the meantime, their run game rounded into form. Since Week 10, Seattle ranks ninth in yards per carry (4.6) and fourth in rushing EPA.

Of course, the Seahawks’ ground attack will look different this week without Charbonnet, who suffered a season-ending torn ACL in last week’s divisional round.

But Walker had already been getting the bulk of the carries and is playing the best football of his career, averaging 5.0 yards per carry since Week 10. That includes a combined 167 rushing yards, 6.2 yards per carry and two touchdowns in Seattle’s two matchups against the Rams, highlighted by a 55-yard TD run in Week 16.

It’s imperative that Walker and the Seahawks continue to be efficient on the ground Sunday. Staying on schedule will be vital to keeping Darnold out of obvious pass-rush situations, which is where Pro Bowl edge rushers Jared Verse and Young can really wreak havoc and force Seattle’s quarterback into bad decisions.

Also, if the Seahawks have enough success on the ground, that could force Los Angeles to put another defender in the box – which in turn could help open up explosive passing opportunities against the Rams’ vulnerable cornerbacks.

The Macdonald-McVay chess match on the other side of the ball will get the bulk of the attention, and rightfully so. But it’ll also be a fascinating tactical battle between Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak and Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, who both have drawn head-coaching interest from other teams.

The X-factor: Special teams

The biggest discrepancy between these teams comes in the game’s third phase.

The Seahawks have been exceptional on special teams all season long, ranking No. 2 in special teams DVOA, according to FTN Fantasy. The Rams, meanwhile, rank 26th.

Seattle’s special teams unit has delivered a slew of impact plays – two Rashid Shaheed kick return touchdowns, a Shaheed punt return TD, a Tory Horton punt return TD, two blocked field goals, a blocked punt and even a rare end-zone kickoff recovery for a touchdown.

And of course, special teams swung the Week 16 matchup, with Shaheed’s 58-yard punt return TD serving as the catalyst to the Seahawks’ dramatic fourth-quarter comeback.

In a matchup with such slim margins, another big-time play from Seattle’s special teams unit could be the difference.

Home cookin’

The Seahawks are 3-0 all-time at home in conference championship games.

They steamrolled the Carolina Panthers 34-14 in the 2005 NFC title game, they edged the San Francisco 49ers 23-17 in the 2013 NFC title game and they staged a stunning comeback for a 28-22 overtime win over the Green Bay Packers in the 2014 NFC title game.

Furthermore, the Seahawks have won 11 consecutive home playoff games with fans in the stands. Seattle’s only home playoff loss over the past two decades came in a wild-card defeat to the Rams during the 2020 COVID season.

Quarterback Darnold played through the pain during their Divisional Round matchup against the San Francisco 49ers.

He went on to help the Seahawks claim a massive 41-6 win at Lumen Field.

But concerns have mounted throughout the week ahead of facing the Rams.

Darnold has been listed as a limited participant in practice for the Seahawks every day ahead of the game.

But the experienced quarterback has insisted that he is raring to go once again.

He has explained that he feels prepared to start against the Rams.

“I feel really good,” Darnold said.

“Feeling really good this whole week. I feel like the process is going right along where it should be.

“I feel really good for Sunday. The guys in the training room do a really good job with everybody, myself included.”

It has been an impressive season for Darnold in Seattle.

He has started every game of the 2025 NFL season for the Seahawks.

The quarterback joined the Seahawks ahead of the 2025 NFL season after a single campaign with the Minnesota Vikings.

Prior to this he was with the New York Jets, the Carolina Panthers and the 49ers.

Darnold’s Seahawks topped the NFC with 14 regular season wins before cruising through the Divisional playoff against the 49ers.

But quarterback Darnold has warned that he is still an injury risk ahead of the NFC Championship game.

“We’re just taking it day by day and making sure I do all the things I need to do to get ready for Sunday.”

The Seahawks will host the Rams at Lumen Field on Sunday, January 25.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2026/01/2026-news-conference-teams-facilities-1053631156.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2026-01-25 03:57:59.291072

This season was meant to be a quiet reset for the Buffalo Bills. But it went the opposite way. The focus should have been on regrouping and moving forward. Instead, the conversation snapped right back to the same uncomfortable place Buffalo knows too well. Everything still revolves around Josh Allen. Two concerns sat side by side. Allen may need surgery on his right foot. And the O-line around him feels thinner and more unsettled than it should for a team chasing a Super Bowl. All together, it creates real questions that Buffalo cannot brush aside.

Bills confirm possible foot procedure as offensive questions mount

The update came from GM Brandon Beane. He broke the news during the Bills' end-of-season press meet in Orchard Park. Plus, Beane confirmed that Allen’s lingering right foot injury could need medical assistance. “He could have to have something done to his foot, potentially here soon,” Beane said during the press conference. “But it would not impact OTA stuff if he does.” Star QB Josh Allen originally injured the foot during the Buffs' Week 16 win over the Browns on Dec. 22, 2025. The issue worsened in Week 17 and followed him into the postseason. By the time the Bills played the Denver Broncos in the wild-card face-off, the star QB was also dealing with pain in his left knee and right finger. The impact showed. Allen accounted for four turnovers in that loss. He still threw for 283 yards and 3 TDs, but his movement looked stiff, and the mistakes came up at the worst time. That health concern now overlaps with a bigger offensive problem. Buffs finished the 2025 regular season without a single 1,000-yard receiver. Allen threw for 3,668 yards and 25 touchdowns, but the production came in pieces. No wideout consistently took pressure off him. WR Keon Coleman remains a major question mark after owner Terry Pegula’s comments during a 53-minute press conference on Jan 22, 2026. Veteran WR Brandin Cooks addressed the situation the following day. “I think this guy can play at a high level,” Cooks said during a locker room media session at One Bills Drive. “He’s misunderstood. He’s working. He’s becoming a pro.” Coleman’s stats did not reflect a second-year leap. He finished the season with 38 catches for 404 yards and four TDs in 13 games. Buffs expected more, but it did not happen. Later, Allen broke down in tears on Saturday: “I let my teammates down tonight,” Allen said postgame on Saturday. … “Just missed opportunities throughout the game. It’s been a long season. I hate how it ended. It’s gonna stick with me for a long time.” Every road leads back to Allen. Buffalo needs him healthy before anything else. The Bills also need to give him an offense that does not ask him to be perfect every week. Surgery may solve the foot issue. Roster changes may address the offense. Until then, the franchise enters another offseason with its most important player carrying the heaviest load.

New England (-4.5) at Denver

All eyes will be on Jarrett Stidham on Sunday afternoon, and most of the talk leading up to the AFC Championship Game has focused on the Broncos’ backup quarterback. Stidham is now the starter, of course, and how effective he will be while replacing the injured Bo Nix is the biggest mystery facing bettors and oddsmakers this week.

The oddsmakers made the first move. Denver was projected to be 3-point home favorite against New England with a healthy Nix. Without Nix, the favorite flipped to Patriots -5.5 when Circa Sports and other books opened the line. The next move has been made by sharp bettors who have slowly pushed the number to 4 and 4.5 by Saturday morning.

The betting public typically plays favorites and, according to splits displayed by Circa and DraftKings, around 70% of the bets have been on the Patriots. There is a classic sharp-versus-square difference of opinion on this game, so who’s right and will the number even matter?

The initial 8.5-point adjustment seems out of line considering Nix is not John Elway and Stidham appears to be an adequate backup plan. Nix threw 11 interceptions in the regular season and tossed a pick to a Buffalo defensive lineman in the third quarter last Saturday. Nix eventually led the Broncos to a 33-30 victory in overtime before being declared out for the season with a fractured right ankle. Stidham, who did not attempt a pass in the regular season, made two preseason starts in August and went a combined 30-for-38 passing for 376 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions — but that was the preseason and these are high stakes.

Amid all of the Stidham talk, the opposing starting quarterback has been overshadowed, which is probably a positive for Drake Maye and the Patriots. Maye was good enough, yet far from great, in postseason victories over the Chargers and Texans. New England’s defense shut down Justin Herbert in the wild-card round and C.J. Stroud in the divisional round while forcing a total of six turnovers and allowing an average of 9.5 points.

This matchup is not all about Stidham. Denver’s defense has not been elite lately, but one thing the Broncos always do is pressure the passer. Denver has registered 71 sacks this season, and the Patriots have allowed 58 sacks, so how Maye and the New England offensive line handle the pressure is a major key to the game.

I have been higher than most handicappers on both of these teams all season — betting on the Broncos to win the AFC West and the Patriots to win the AFC East — so while I’m not necessarily looking to fade New England, the line adjustment looks out of whack and the number is the most important factor in my opinion.

My expectation is Stidham will play well enough to give the Broncos a shot to win, and I bet Denver +5.5 early in the week. Home underdogs in the NFL playoffs are 9-6 straight up and 12-3 ATS since 2018, and this ‘dog should be live in a game that goes to the wire.

Best Bet: Denver Broncos +4.5

Los Angeles Rams at Seattle (-2.5)

The first two meetings between these teams were decided by a total of three points, so the rubber match for the NFC title should be another thriller. The Seahawks bring in the league’s No. 1 scoring defense and the Rams boast the No. 1 scoring offense. I usually lean to the dominant defense, but the quarterback edge tilts heavily in favor of Matthew Stafford. It would not be surprising if Sam Darnold turns in the worst performance of the four quarterbacks in action Sunday. Darnold threw six interceptions in two games against the Rams, including four in the Seahawks’ loss in Los Angeles. In last year’s wild-card round, when Darnold started for the Vikings, he threw an interception and took nine sacks in a 27-9 loss to the Rams. Darnold, who committed a league-high 20 turnovers in the regular season, also has an oblique injury that could compromise his play.

In Week 16, when Seattle pulled out a controversial 38-37 overtime win, Stafford shredded the Seahawks for 457 passing yards and three touchdowns while throwing no picks and taking no sacks. I’m rolling with Stafford and his elite set of weapons — wideouts Davante Adams and Puka Nacua and running back Kyren Williams — to get revenge. I’ve got a Super Bowl ticket on the Rams at 30-1 odds, so it makes sense to stick with my preseason pick to win it all.

AFC Championship

Denver +4.5 vs. New England

With Bo Nix, Denver would have been -2 or -2.5 in this spot. The market peaked at New England at -5.5 before dropping to its current price. Is this large drop off to Jarrett Stidham really justified in this number? Before going into further detail on the Broncos QB situation, we also should examine the Patriots’ situation.

In two playoff games, Drake Maye has fumbled six times and has taken 10 sacks (45% pressure-to-sack ratio). That is scary for New England against a Denver team that had 68 sacks in the regular season, which tied for the fifth-most in NFL history. Maye is also making his first career road playoff start, and Denver is just about the toughest place to do that.

Defensively, the Patriots have held opposing running backs to 61 yards on 31 carries in two playoff games vs. the Chargers and Texans. So, Denver will have to throw the ball here.

While Stidham only has 20 career games (just 4 starts) in his seven-year NFL career, he has been in this Denver system for three years with one of the league’s best play-callers and is behind what was ranked as the league’s best OL unit this season by PFF. The Patriots had the luxury of going against four highly injured offensive lines (Jets, Dolphins, Chargers, and Texans) over the last four games.

Sean Payton has a history of success with backup QBs. In 2021, Jameis Winston began the year as the starting QB. Winston, Trevor Siemian, Taysom Hill, and Ian Book got starts in 2021. Winston got 7, Siemian got 4, Hill got 5 total with the other positions he plays, and Book got one.

All of those Saints’ quarterbacks combined for the following:

293/503

3,186 yards

29 touchdowns

13 interceptions

87.4 passer rating

In the 2019 season, Teddy Bridgewater started five games because of an injury to Drew Brees. In those five games, the Saints went 5-0, and Bridgewater’s numbers were as follows:

133/196 (67.9%)

1,384 yards

9 touchdowns

2 interceptions

99.1 passer rating

Overall, Payton has had success in those games having to start a backup QB, going 12-9 SU and 14-7 ATS.

Payton is also 61-42-2 ATS (59.2%) for his career as an underdog.

Keep in mind that Denver has one of the better homefield advantages in the NFL and went 9-1 at home this season.

NFC Championship

Los Angeles Rams +3 (-130) at Seattle

The last time these teams met in Week 16, the Rams led 30-14 in the fourth quarter only to have everything go wrong in what ended up a 38-37 loss:

Seahawks Rashid Shaheed punt return TD followed by a two-point conversion.

Seahawks Sam Darnold to AJ Barner TD followed by a fluky two-point conversion where Zach Charbonnet picked up a loose ball.

Rams missed FG with 2:11 to go.

Rams Matthew Stafford to Puka Nacua TD with 6:27 left in OT.

Seahawks Darnold to Jaxon Smith-Njigba TD then another two-point conversion (Seahawks 3-for-3 two-point conversions in 4th Q and OT!).

The Rams outgained the Seahawks 581 to 415 and still lost. To be fair, Seattle dominated the Week 11 meeting in Los Angeles with a 414-to-249-yard edge but lost 21-19 due to Darnold throwing four interceptions.

That Week 16 result played a major role in Seattle eventually securing homefield in the NFC and forcing the Rams to play its now third straight road game in the playoffs and seventh game away from home in nine weeks. Needless to say, the spot is not exactly ideal for the road team.

Seattle closed as 1.5-point favorites in that Week 16 game and is now laying 2.5 after a dominant 41-6 (41 points on just 281 yards of total offense) victory over the 49ers, while the Rams had to score in the final two minutes to get by Carolina and had to go to OT to win at Chicago. The Seahawks look dominant while the Rams have been surviving, and yet this number has not moved hardly at all?

The Rams are the first team in the Super Bowl era to lose ATS in both the Wild Card round and the Divisional round, but advance to the Conference Championship.

Darnold is also still battling the oblique injury and was not even confirmed as playing until game day.

The two meetings between these teams produced these numbers:

Points Scored

Rams: 58; Seahawks: 57

Total Yards

Rams: 830; Seahawks: 829

The numbers would indicate a coin-flip game, and it likely will be. However, if you watch the two games in their entirety, the Rams outplayed the Seahawks in six and perhaps seven of the eight quarters.",https://vsin.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/USATSI_27426696_168384654_lowres.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 03:58:07.913611

Pegasus World Cup Turf, Gulfstream Park, Race #12

Let’s kick it off with a price in the turf, #4 One Stripe, sits on the board at 12-1 and for a good reason. The two previous efforts in Grade 1 company have been less than stellar, but there are excuses in both. At Woodbine, the trip was less than ideal on the back stretch and around the turn. He has no chance in the Breeders’ Cup once he drew the rail and had to send. The comeback at Gulfstream Park was awesome, and Motion moved right back to the Grade 1 level. He’s worth a play at the price.

#8 Cabo Spirit has been a fun horse on the West Coast, but will now try that luck in Florida. He’s fast, very fast, and needs the lead. Lucky for Cabo, he is clearly lone speed here, and this is a great course to be alone on the lead. He has a real shot to go gate to wire.

#2 Program Trading has yet to return to the level we saw him before the layoff in 2024. He’s got the best pair of races on paper and is definitely a logical contender here, but none of his efforts since have been good enough. I am just not willing to take a short price.

#1 Test Score will take on older horses for the first time, but was impressive in his 3-year-old campaign in dancing every dance. We have seen younger horses win this race before, and improving is not out of the realm of possibility.

Top 4: 4-8-2-1

The Bets: $50 Win #4

Pegasus World Cup, Gulfstream Park, Race #13

The main event on Saturday is a fascinating race. We will start with the undefeated favorite, #1 Disco Time, for Brad Cox. He was awesome in the Dwyer, but that was the toughest field he has faced to date and that was not a tough field. He’s quick and will want to get to the front early, but it will be crowded up front. He may be a superstar after Saturday, but at 8-5 it is tough to run to the window.

#11 White Abarrio is back for more after winning the 2025 version of the race in a romp. His lead up last year included two foundational races here at Gulfstream Park. Those are missing this year, and that is a big-time concern when you look up and see 4-1.

Despite having the favorite, #7 Tappan Street is also entered for Brad Cox. He is famously the only horse to beat Sovereignty last year, but missed months with an injury after that victory. He returned in December and won while not being overly impressive. Despite that, here he is entered in the Pegasus. It sure feels like he fires his shot here, and the price is right at 6-1.

#8 Poster is the bomber that I am interested in here. I mentioned the pace with Disco Time. There are as many as six horses who want to be forward from the jump. That sets up for Poster to be flying home late. He will need to improve, but his last out was the best dirt race of his career and adds blinkers, a 27% move for his trainer.",https://vsin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Horse-racing-copy.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 02:57:46.815416

Moore was also elevated last week but was inactive for the divisional round (he was elevated for a game check as a reward for his work on the practice squad). One of Moore or Bandy could be a candidate to play on Sunday as fellow receiver Troy Franklin (hamstring) is listed as questionable on the injury report.

Bo Nix’s season is officially over.

The Broncos finalized those expected moves for their starting center and starting quarterback Saturday, according to the league’s transaction wire.

Denver put Nix on injured reserve after he broke a bone in his ankle last week and had surgery to repair the injury Tuesday. They activated Wattenberg from injured reserve to take Nix’s roster spot, putting him in line to start for Denver on Sunday against New England in the AFC Championship game.

Wattenberg, who signed a four-year, $48 million extension earlier in the season, was a full participant in practice all week. That sets the stage for him to jump back into the starting lineup. Fellow center Alex Forsyth, who started the past three games in Wattenberg’s place, is questionable with an ankle injury.

Nix has been ticketed for injured reserve since breaking a bone in his ankle in the waning seconds of overtime against Buffalo last week. The Broncos typically make IR placements on Saturday and followed the same procedure with their starting quarterback.

Bandy, Moore up. In addition to those moves, Denver is elevating veteran wide receivers Michael Bandy and Elijah Moore from the practice squad.

Bandy has been the next man up at receiver for the Broncos because of his ability to play every spot. He caught a touchdown against Green Bay, the first of his career.

Moore was also elevated for the Divisional game against Buffalo but was inactive on game day.

Moore has not yet appeared in a game for the Broncos since signing earlier in the season, but he brings speed to the equation. Broncos second-year receiver Troy Franklin (hamstring) is questionable to play Sunday. If he’s unable to go, Moore could slide into Denver’s receiver rotation with Courtland Sutton, Pat Bryant, Marvin Mims Jr. and Lil’Jordan Humphrey.

At 6-foot-4 and 221 pounds, Hollins' large catch radius makes him a top option for quarterback Drake Maye on in-breaking routes. Furthermore, his blocking prowess was often cited by coaches as an important part of the running game.

Stidham has attempted just 66 passes in his three seasons with the Broncos — all of which came during the 2023 season.
“For the AFC Title Game: The #Patriots have ruled out leading sacker Harold Landry because of a knee injury,” NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport stated.
After six seasons with the Tennessee Titans, where he played for Vrabel, Landry signed a 3-year, $43.5 million contract with the Patriots during the offseason.
“Uh, yeah, we released Darrel Taylor,” Vrabel responded.","Heading into Sunday’s AFC Championship game, both the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos are battling some pretty significant injuries.

The biggest, of course, is Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, who suffered a broken bone in his ankle in last weekend’s 33-30 win over the Buffalo Bills. The injury forced backup Jarrett Stidham into the starting role — and the pressure has never been higher.

Stidham has attempted just 66 passes in his three seasons with the Broncos — all of which came during the 2023 season. He has a tall order ahead of him in facing a Patriots defense that ranked seventh in the NFL this season and allowed he fourth-fewest points per game (18.8).

“Stiddy’s been waiting for this moment for the entirety of his career,” Broncos offensive lineman Mike McGlinchey said. “He’s more prepared than anybody would be in this situation. And he can ball, he can flat out play quarterback. We’ve seen it every day in practice. We’ve seen it in training camp. I have no doubts he’s going to go out there and play his butt off.”

Brutal Injury Rocks Patriots Defense

While Denver is doing all it can to overcome Nix’s injury, New England has a pretty significant injury of its own that it will have to work around.

“For the AFC Title Game: The #Patriots have ruled out leading sacker Harold Landry because of a knee injury,” NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport stated. “Meanwhile, WR Mack Hollins (abdomen) is questionable, with optimism that he goes.”

Landry’s loss is a big one.

He led the Patriots with 8.5 sacks and 10 tackles for loss, in addition to his 48 pressures, 29 hurries, and 10 QB hits, according to Pro Football Focus. His 11.9% pass-rush win-rate was also second-highest among edge-rushers, behind only K’Lavon Chaisson (14.9%).

Without Landry, the pass-rushing onus falls on Chaisson, who had 54 pressures, 34 hurries and 7.5 sacks, linebacker Elijah Ponder (15 pressures, 9 hurries, 4 sacks), and Milton Williams (36 pressures, 27 hurries, 3.5 sacks).

After six seasons with the Tennessee Titans, where he played for Vrabel, Landry signed a 3-year, $43.5 million contract with the Patriots during the offseason.

Landry has totaled 8.5 or more sacks, 40 or more pressures, and 25 of more hurries in five of his last six seasons.

Vrabel Gets Brutally Honest About Player Release

One of the players many fans were likely banking on stepping in and filling any holes along the front seven was defensive end Darrell Taylor.

The former Seattle Seahawks second-round pick was claimed by the team last week, and he was expected to make his Patriots debut this week.

The only problem is he’s no longer on the roster.

In an awkward interaction with a reporter, in which head coach Mike Vrabel was asked about Taylor’s status, the 50-year-old coach gave a brutally honest answer about what went down with Taylor.

“How has Darrell Taylor gotten acclimated so far?” the reporter asked.

“Uh, yeah, we released Darrel Taylor,” Vrabel responded. “We’ll put that out here at 4:00, so not very well.”

The 28-year-ol Taylor has bounced around between Seattle, Chicago, and Houston before signing with New England last week. In his five-year NFL career, he’d logged 126 tackles, 121 pressures, 73 hurries, 24.5 sacks, 22 QB hits, 8 forced fumbles, 5 passes defensed, and a fumble recovery, per Pro Football Focus.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2257293921.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780,N,,2026-01-24 19:00:08.818461

Even though the relationship between the Grizzlies and their two-time All-Star has seemed tenuous, Morant played down the trade rumors when asked about it after he led Memphis to a 126-109 win over the Magic in London.

“If anybody in here knows me, I’m a very loyal guy,” Morant said. “I got a (Grizzlies) logo on my back, so that should tell you exactly where I want to be.”

He was released shortly after the Broncos drafted Nix the following spring and signed Zach Wilson as the team’s third quarterback.
As Stephenville readied for its third-round game, Stidham was approaching the end of his rehab.
What could be expected of Stidham, a quarterback who has never had a moment like this one in the NFL?","ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Sean Payton sat down at a table cluttered with recorders and notebooks and skipped the pleasantries.

It was early in the morning on March 27, 2023, and the new Denver Broncos coach chugged a large coffee as he sat down to answer questions from a group of reporters at the NFL’s annual league meetings inside a swanky hotel in Phoenix. Payton didn’t hold back about the mess he was inheriting after a five-win season for the Broncos in 2022 that resulted in the firing of first-year coach Nathaniel Hackett.

“If it sounds like I’m being critical …” Payton said at one point as he discussed the “hard to watch” film from the previous season, “I am.”

Payton perked up, though, when the opportunity arose to talk about the quarterback. Not the starter, Russell Wilson, the player for whom the Broncos had traded five premium draft picks one year earlier, but the backup the team had just signed: Jarrett Stidham.

“We have a young player,” Payton began, “and I think there’s certain players we saw in free agency, can they come in and play and start? Yes, I think you get that with Jarrett, but I also think you get a player who is still ascending. If you watch the 49ers game (Stidham started for the Raiders at the end of the 2022 season) … that’s impressive against a good defense. He was a priority for us, quietly. Fortunately, it worked out where we were able to get him.”

The Broncos will soon find out just how consequential it was to sign Stidham amidst little fanfare nearly three years ago. He will start Sunday in the AFC Championship Game against the New England Patriots in place of injured QB1 Bo Nix. Stidham will throw his first pass in a game that counts in 749 days. He will become the first quarterback in NFL history to start in the conference title game without having attempted a pass in that same season.

“Just really excited to get out there,” the 29-year-old said Thursday. “Once the ball is snapped, that first play, it’s just football at that point. It’ll be fun.”

In many ways, Stidham represents a best, worst-case scenario for the Broncos. It’s hard to pick a worse time to lose your starter than before a game with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line. It is also true there are few teams in better position to call up a backup with three seasons of experience in the offense he will be asked to pilot in the biggest game of the year.

“That’s why,” Payton said this week, “that signing was important. I’m glad that the acquisition took place.”

How exactly did Stidham end up in this almost unprecedented spot? And how else has it shifted a quarterback room that was jolted by Nix’s injury?

Why Payton chose Stidham — and vice versa

Payton has always grasped the importance of depth in a quarterback room. His biggest coaching mentor, Bill Parcells, famously rode backup quarterback Jeff Hostetler to a Super Bowl with the New York Giants in 1990. But Payton’s own view of that critical component of a roster was crystallized in 2019, when he was coaching the New Orleans Saints and star quarterback Drew Brees faced the first extended absence of his career with the franchise.

Enter Teddy Bridgewater. The backup won his first start as Payton catered aspects of his offense around a quarterback with a different skill set than Brees. The Saints won again the following week. Then, again. Five in a row, all told.

“At our first team meeting (after the Brees injury), I said, ‘I’m not worried about Bridgewater,’” Payton said. “‘I’m worried about everyone else in this room making sure that their level is up to speed.’ After the fifth (win), this is about when Drew’s thumb’s getting better. I was just kidding Drew and said, ‘How’re you doing?’ He said, ‘I’m getting ready to come back,’ and I said, ‘Well, make sure you take your time. Things are going well here.’ I think the most important thing is, and it’s the same with tight ends or receivers or runners, ‘What are the things that they like? What are the things that they do well?’ Then building it around that.”

Stidham drew the attention of Payton — and other decision-makers around the league — when he made his first career start in Week 17 of the 2022 season and threw for 365 yards and three touchdowns in a narrow loss to the San Francisco 49ers, who featured the No. 1 defense in both points and yards allowed that season.

The Broncos had signed Wilson to a five-year, $242 million contract extension months earlier, but Payton was adamant Denver still needed to make a substantial investment to add to the quarterback room.

“That’s when we became aggressive,” Payton said.

Stidham, a 2019 fourth-round pick of the Patriots who never started a game in New England during the regular season before being traded to the Las Vegas Raiders, had options as his first contract ended. That included the chance to sign back with the Raiders and head coach Josh McDaniels, whose stint as New England’s offensive coordinator made him the only play caller Stidham had known to that point. But Stidham took the Broncos’ two-year, $10 million offer, in part because he believed in Payton’s ability to help him grow as a quarterback, even if there wasn’t an immediate pathway to a starting job.

“Sean’s been great to me my whole time here,” said Stidham, who signed a two-year, $12 million deal in March to remain in Denver as Nix’s backup. “Obviously, he was a big reason I decided to come to Denver two years ago and then again this last year. We’ve had a great relationship. I’ve learned a ton from him, along with everybody else on the staff and everything. So, obviously, super appreciative of Sean.”

Why Stidham’s wait has been so long in Denver

When Payton decided to bench Wilson with two games left in the 2023 season — a move that preceded the veteran quarterback’s release the following spring and left the Broncos with a record $85 million in dead money on their salary cap — it opened up a potential starting opportunity in the NFL for Stidham for the first time. The Broncos used their 12th overall pick on Nix, creating a quarterback competition between the rookie and the veteran holdover from Payton’s first season in Denver.

It would not be wrong to say Stidham performed as well or better than Nix in that 2024 training camp competition on a day-by-day, throw-by-throw grading scale. Payton, though, chose Nix, as the rookie closed camp strong and then performed well in the preseason. Stidham, though disappointed, vowed to stay ready, then proved it in practice.

“He just knows what he’s doing and understands why the coaches are calling certain calls,” said Broncos defensive end John Franklin-Myers, who has battled Stidham in practices the past two seasons. “That’s what makes him so good. Sometimes you go out there, you play football and you run what’s called, but you’re not understanding where you want the ball, how fast, when and everything like that. Stiddy, man, he’s running scout-team plays and he’s running them … better than the (opponent’s) starting quarterback.”

It just never translated into an opportunity for Stidham, making his growth as a quarterback a largely behind-the-scenes affair. Nix is the only quarterback in the NFL who attempted every one of his team’s passes the past two seasons.

That continuity has made Stidham’s sudden starting role all the more abrupt, but he’s not the only one whose job has been different the past week.

A new No. 2 — and familiar No. 3

When Colts quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles tear in Week 14, Indianapolis quickly worked down a list of experience with coach Shane Steichen’s offense. Before landing on Philip Rivers, the Colts made a call to representatives of Sam Ehlinger, who was residing at the time on the Broncos’ practice squad after spending his first four seasons with the Colts.

Instead, even with the potential to start a game for the Colts in front of him, Ehlinger chose to stay in Denver and continue his daily work behind Nix and Stidham and alongside quarterbacks coach Davis Webb, who has drawn leaguewide attention during this hiring cycle for the way he has worked with that room.

“We’re glad he’s staying,” Payton said of Ehlinger in December. “We think a lot of him — a lot. He’s been a real good surprise for all of us, especially offensively, when we see and watch him, and he made that decision. That’s a big deal.”

Ehlinger, who was promoted to the Broncos’ active roster before the playoffs and was active as the third-string quarterback against the Bills, could now be just one play away from playing in the AFC Championship Game. Ehlinger has started three career games, one fewer than Stidham. All came with the Colts, the team that selected him out of the University of Texas in the sixth round of the 2021 NFL Draft. He has completed 63.4 percent of his career passes for 573 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions.

The injury to Nix meant the Broncos needed another quarterback on their roster — and fast. Luckily, a passer familiar with Payton’s offense lives just down the road in the Denver suburb of Highlands Ranch. Ben DiNucci was on Denver’s practice squad during the 2023 season. When Stidham replaced Wilson at the end of the year, DiNucci was slotted into the backup role. He was released shortly after the Broncos drafted Nix the following spring and signed Zach Wilson as the team’s third quarterback. DiNucci spent most of the fall working as an analyst with CBS Sports, even providing analysis on the aftermath of the Broncos’ divisional playoff win against the Bills.

Then, he got a call from the Broncos.

“It has come to my attention that a team may need my services,” DiNucci wrote in a post on X shortly after news of his signing with Denver was announced. “Good thing my schedule is open this week. Broncos Country … Let’s go to a Super Bowl?”

DiNucci could be promoted to the roster ahead of Sunday’s game, which would allow him to be active and serve as Denver’s third-string quarterback. It was only three years ago that the 49ers’ two active quarterbacks suffered injuries in the NFC Championship Game loss to the Eagles, forcing Brock Purdy to essentially play the second half with one usable arm. Denver won’t have Nix on Sunday, but they will enter the game with three quarterbacks who have experience in this Broncos offense.

Payton on Stidham: ‘Watch out’

When Stidham was a senior quarterback at Stephenville High in Texas in 2014, he suffered a hand injury that required surgery. The hope was that he could return for the fourth round of the state playoffs, if Stephenville advanced that far.

As Stephenville readied for its third-round game, Stidham was approaching the end of his rehab. Head coach Joe Gillespie decided to have the senior quarterback dress and warm up before the game against Lubbock’s Estacado High, if only to give the opponent something else to think about.

“I wasn’t going to play him,” Gillespie said. “I didn’t start him. He stood next to me on the sideline. I was like, ‘Hold the chart, man.’”

Then, Stephenville went three-and-out on its first possession. Estacado followed by quickly flying down the field for a touchdown.

“So I looked at him before the second series and said, ‘Buddy, you’re in,’” Gillespie said. “He goes out and sets a school record for most touchdowns in a game and most yards in a game. He hadn’t played in six weeks, and he goes out there and just lights it on fire.”

Stephenville won 66-64.

Stidham’s competitiveness, big arm and ability to process coverage are traits that have shown up in moments similar to that one during his time at Auburn, but they have largely been hidden from public view since he entered the league. It was a fact that Payton was asked about moments after he delivered news that Nix, the quarterback who had just led Denver on its eighth game-winning drive of the season, was no longer available. What could be expected of Stidham, a quarterback who has never had a moment like this one in the NFL?

“Watch out,” Payton said. “Just watch.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/23155958/GettyImages-2166355261-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-24 20:01:41.790204

Darnold, who has been battling an oblique injury, has no game designation and told reporters on Friday that he is feeling ready to go to take on the rival Rams.

“I feel really good,” Darnold said, per ESPN. “Feeling really good this whole week. I feel like the process is going right along where it should be, so I feel really good for Sunday.”

Darnold, 28, initially suffered the injury to his left side during practice earlier this month and played through it during the divisional round, throwing for 124 yards — while completing 12-of-17 of his passes — with a touchdown in the Seahawks’ 41-6 win over the 49ers.

The two-time Pro Bowler was limited in practice for all three days this week, a plan by the team to help him get ready for Sunday’s game against the Los Angeles.

Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald said Friday that everything about Darnold’s recovery process has gone according to plan.

“The guys in the training room do a really good job with everybody, myself included,” Darnold said. “We’re just taking it day by day and making sure I do all the things I need to do to get ready for Sunday.”

Seattle split its regular-season series with the Rams this year, with Los Angeles winning the November matchup 21-19 at SoFi Stadium and the Seahawks emerging victorious in a 38-37 overtime win during a Week 16 matchup.

Projected Roster Percentages

Conference Championships NFL DFS GPP Advice & Picks

Quarterbacks

Matthew Stafford (QB – LAR) @ SEA | DraftKings: $6,300/FanDuel: $8,300

We’ve seen this matchup twice and got two wildly different results. The first game was low scoring with limited upside across the board. Matthew Stafford managed to throw two touchdowns but only 130 yards, and was unproductive from a fantasy perspective.

In the second matchup, Stafford threw for over 450 yards and three touchdowns. He’s been turnover-free and handled the Seattle defense well. His upside is less about him and more about the Seattle offense limiting turnovers and maintaining a high pace. Stafford is coming off an extremely underwhelming performance, but is primed for a bounce-back game.

Sam Darnold (QB – SEA) vs. LAR | DraftKings: $5,500/FanDuel: $7,400

It will feel objectively awful to roster Sam Darnold, but he is really the perfect contrarian play this week. Both matchups with the Rams have been two of his better yardage performances of the year, throwing 44 and 34 attempts. He’s appropriate for GPPs rather than cash games because the floor is extremely low and the ceiling is solid.

Last week, playing through injury, the Seahawks limited his volume — just 12 completions on 17 attempts — and leaned heavily on the ground game. However, Darnold claims the injury won’t be an issue this week and that he’s prepared to push volume to match the Rams’ pace.

Running Backs

Kenneth Walker (RB – SEA) vs. LAR | DraftKings: $6,200/FanDuel: $8,000

Kenneth Walker is seeing a bump in pricing with Zach Charbonnet out, but he’s still very reasonably priced for the upside. His value per salary is great, and he offers the highest ceiling of any running back this week. Seattle should lean heavily on Walker, and he’s been a strong contributor as a receiver in the previous two matchups with the Rams.

Oddly enough, two of the five touchdowns Walker had during the regular season came against the Rams, and he had zero problem with yardage against them. Walker may underperform if the Rams focus on shutting him down and forcing Darnold to throw. However, Walker’s upside is far too high to fade.

RJ Harvey (RB – DEN) vs. NE | DraftKings: $5,900/FanDuel: $6,700*

RJ Harvey was primed for a strong performance in the Divisional Round with an excellent matchup against Buffalo, but was severely limited on the ground with just six carries for 20 yards. The game was a shootout, with the Broncos abandoning the run.

They can’t afford to do that with Jarrett Stidham at quarterback and will have to lean on the ground attack. Harvey can still benefit from receiving work, but we should see an increase in carries this week to maintain a more balanced attack.

Rhamondre Stevenson (RB – NE) @ DEN | DraftKings: $6,000/FanDuel: $7,000

Rhamondre Stevenson left the game temporarily in the Divisional Round due to an injury and still managed to outproduce TreVeyon Henderson. As much as we’d love to see Henderson thrive, Stevenson has been far more efficient and a huge contributor in the receiving game.

Denver’s run defense is tough, but not impenetrable. James Cook had over 100 yards on the ground against them last week. If Stidham can’t keep the offense moving, time of possession could be lopsided, and the Patriots could lean on the ground game to wear the Broncos’ defense down.

Wide Receivers

Jaxon Smith-Njigba (WR – SEA) vs. LAR | DraftKings: $8,000/FanDuel: $9,400

Jaxon Smith-Njigba has been solid this season against the Rams. The only issue is that he never reaches his ceiling in those matchups, but the volume has been extremely consistent, with a minimum of eight receptions and 96 yards in each game.

However, the salary gap between Smith-Njigba and Puka Nacua is enough to justify his value. Even if the matchup is a lower-scoring affair like the first game, he’s still an excellent volume play.

Puka Nacua (WR – LAR) @ SEA | DraftKings: $9,000/FanDuel: $9,800*

The Puka Nacua chalk didn’t hit in the Divisional Round, but we’ll continue to trot Nacua out in our lineups this week because the ceiling is far too high to fade him. Like Stafford, this is a boom/bust situation. He’ll hit big, or he’ll flop.

Nacua had a floor performance in the first matchup withjust 14 fantasy points. In the second matchup, he had his highest scoring performance of the season. Unfortunately, because of the Bo Nix injury, the gap between Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Nacua is so aggressive that both are key plays this week.

Kayshon Boutte (WR – NE) @ DEN | DraftKings: $4,500/FanDuel: $6,000

Kayshon Boutte has been the most productive and consistent Patriots receiver in the playoffs thus far, with four receptions for 66 yards during the Wild Card Weekend against the Chargers and three receptions for 75 yards and a touchdown last weekend.

Denver isn’t an ideal matchup, particularly for deep threat receivers. However, Boutte’s pricing makes him a solid value play this week.

Additional Considerations

Cooper Kupp (WR – SEA) vs. LAR | DraftKings: $3,800/FanDuel: $5,800

Pat Bryant (WR – DEN) vs. NE | DraftKings: $4,400/FanDuel: $5,000*

Lil’Jordan Humphrey (WR – DEN) vs. NE | DraftKings: $3,400/FanDuel: $5,200

Note: To pay up for both Puka Nacua and Jaxon Smith-Njigba or all three backs, you’ll need low-end receivers, and pulling from the Broncos with Jarrett Stidham at quarterback is a solid contrarian play. If active, Pat Bryant is the target. If Bryant is out, go with Lil’Jordan Humphrey. Note the odd low-end pricing differences on FanDuel.

Tight Ends

AJ Barner (TE – SEA) vs. LAR | DraftKings: $4,000/FanDuel: $5,200

AJ Barner has been consistently solid against the Rams with 15 and 17 fantasy points in the regular season matchups. He can be inconsistent in general because his volume is more dependent on Darnold than the other pass-catchers.

However, with an expected increase in volume from Darnold this week and a solid track record, Barner offers a solid ceiling and the best floor of any tight end of the slate outside of Hunter Henry.

Additional Considerations

Hunter Henry (TE – NE) @ DEN | DraftKings: $4,800/FanDuel: $5,700*

D/ST

New England D/ST @ DEN | DraftKings: $3,500/FanDuel: $5,000

We’re running it back with New England’s defense. They came through with the pick-six last week, and Jarrett Stidham provides the same opportunity. Pricing continues to be somewhat irrelevant in the playoffs, given the dramatic difference in ceiling from the higher-priced defense.

The Broncos’ defense does offer the best value for their pricing this week, and it is tempting to dip down. However, we could see the defense worn down as the game goes on if Stidham can’t push long drives.",https://cdn.fantasypros.com/wp-content/images/kenneth_Walker_seahawks/1470x650.jpg,N,,2026-01-24 18:00:37.324264

Dalton Kincaid Played Entire Season Injured

Though injuries limited him some during the season, tight end Dalton Kincaid was often quarterback Josh Allen’s favorite target and arguably the team’s top red-zone threat, which makes what fellow tight end Dawson Knox said about Kincaid this week so impressive.

“#Bills TE Dawson Knox stated that Dalton Kincaid played this season with a torn PCL. A source close to Kincaid confirmed what Knox said on @MMwithMitch’s podcast saying Kincaid played the entire 2025 season with a torn PCL,” Syracuse.com’s Ryan Talbot reported on X.

Kincaid’s injured PCL — a stabilizing ligament that connects the femur to the tibia and prevents the shin bone from sliding backward — likely limited him from running at full speed and hindered his ability to cut and avoid tackles.

“Dalton has a torn PCL he was playing through,” Knox said. “Just the amount of head, shoulders, knees and toes. Eyes and ears and mouth and nose, dude. Everything. I mean, it was easier to make a list of the things that didn’t hurt on a lot of these guys.

“… Guys that were able to kind of put their bodies on the line. Even if they were already hurt, to give whatever boost they could to this team to help us win games.”

It was also the same injury that he suffered back in November of last season that flared up again this year. He rehabbed his PCL during the offseason, though it resurfaced during training camp.

The former first-round pick missed Buffalo’s Week 6 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons with an oblique injury, and he missed three more games later in the season with a thigh/hamstring injury in addition to battling his PCL ailment.

Kincaid Named to Pro Bowl Roster

Despite the news of his injury, Kincaid got some good news on Friday.

After Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce withdrew from the Pro Bowl games, it was announced that Kincaid would take his place on the roster. It’s his first career Pro Bowl selection.

Conversely, Kincaid joins two teammates — Allen, running back James Cook, and left tackle Dion Dawkins — as 2026 Pro Bowlers. The event will be held on Tuesday, February 3 at 8 p.m. ET at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, California.

Despite playing four fewer games than Bills’ leading receiver Khalil Shakir, who totaled 72 catches on 95 targets for 719 yards and 4 touchdowns, Kincaid wasn’t far behind.

The 26-year-old TE caught 39 passes on 49 targets for 571 yards and a career-high 5 touchdowns. Kincaid led all tight ends this season in yards per reception (14.6), and quarterbacks had a 149.2 passer rating when targeting him — also the highest among TEs.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-1922379836.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780,N,,2026-01-24 18:00:48.110869

Let's start with the bad news.

Patriots edge rusher Harold Landry III has been officially ruled out for the game with a knee injury. He has been dealing with the knee issue for multiple weeks and playing through it. However, the injury is clearly starting to take a toll, and this week, he won't be available for the Patriots.

That should mean more reps for Anfernee Jennings, who has stepped up in a major way for the team in recent weeks. They'll need another strong showing from the veteran outside linebacker when lining up across from K'Lavon Chaisson against a tough Broncos' offensive line.

And now for the good news: Mack Hollins and Joshua Farmer are questionable to return. Hollins, the team's fourth-leading wide receiver, was a full participant at practice on Friday, and the same was the case for Farmer, the rookie defensive tackle.

Both potentially returning for the AFC Championship Game would be major additions to the roster ahead of the biggest game of the season. Here are the game statuses for both teams ahead of Sunday's matchup:

This week, George Kittle was spotted back out on the golf course just two weeks after his devastating injury. Although he isn’t able to put weight on his foot, that hasn’t stopped him from hitting long-range shots.

George Kittle hit the course this week with 49ers teammates Brock Purdy, Trent Williams and Kyle Juszczyk. However, the 32 year old didn’t even need to leave his golf cart thanks to a new device from Power2Golf.

The company’s $1,500 device was shouted out by Kittle on his Instagram and allows him and other golfers to hit the ball from the comfort of a golf cart and avoiding having to stand up.

The 49ers lost in blowout fashion last week against the Seattle Seahawks without Kittle available. However, San Francisco will be hopeful that Kittle can return to his All-Pro self in time for the 2026 season.

Fifth round: DB Jordan Hancock He came to the Bills as a diverse piece who could play CB, NCB and safety.
Seventh round: WR Kaden Prather He suffered a hamstring injury in training camp and was eventually waived with an injury settlement.","ORCHARD PARK - For a team like the Buffalo Bills that has a top-heavy payroll structure, largely thanks to the well-deserved contract of superstar quarterback Josh Allen, nailing the draft is imperative in building a playoff-worthy roster.

The Bills have been tight against the salary cap for several years, and that has limited the aisle where general manager Brandon Beane can shop in the free agent market. He can’t pick from the expensive name brands, he has to settle for generic brands, and as we’ve seen in recent years, that hasn’t worked out well.

For example, in the last two offseasons, just looking at two position groups that have been problematic for the Bills, Beane signed wide receivers Curtis Samuel, Joshua Palmer, Elijah Moore, Marques Valdes-Scantling and Chase Claypool, and defensive linemen Joey Bosa, Michael Hoecht, Larry Ogunjobi, Dawuane Smoot, Austin Johnson, and DeShawn Williams.

Bosa was good for the first half of 2025, Hoecht may eventually be the best of that bunch if he returns strong from his torn Achilles, and everyone else was either a bust - the level depending on the investment - or a player who contributed nothing much beyond rotational snaps.

Beane needs to be great on draft weekend, and in 2025, his nine-man class was far from great. In fact, it was pretty disappointing, though injuries played a major role in that evaluation.

The only player who didn’t make the team was seventh-round wide receiver Kaden Prather, but while the other eight made it, only two gave Buffalo a representative season - fourth-round defensive tackle Deone Walker and fifth-round tight end Jackson Hawes.

As for everyone else, they have a lot to prove heading into their sophomore 2026 season, and if those players - who need to be part of the core of the team moving forward - don’t provide more snaps and production, it’s going to be a setback for the Bills.

Here’s my breakdown of how each rookie draft pick performed in 2025:

First round: CB Maxwell Hairston

Beane knew he had to pick a CB high and Hairston looked like a fine pick, especially after he ran the fastest 40-yard dash time at the NFL scouting combine. Signing veteran Tre’Davious White to compete with Hairston and to also mentor him, was a good idea because it also eased some of the pressure on the rookie.

However, in no way did the Bills envision White being the starter almost the entire season, but that’s what happened after Hairston suffered a knee injury early in training camp. He ended up playing in just 11 games before another injury in Week 18 knocked him out of the playoffs. He was on the field for a mere 348 snaps and only three times did he surpass 40 snaps because even when he played, he shared the CB2 position with White and usually played less than the vet.

Per Pro Football Focus, Hairston gave up 15 receptions on 25 targets for 203 yards, not bad and it’s something to build on in 2026. He showed a willingness to tackle, and the Bills can only hope that even a truncated year under his belt will enable him to beat out whoever the competition is to line up opposite CB1 Christian Benford.

Second round: DT TJ Sanders

The Bills traded up to pick Sanders at No. 41 overall and they did not get what they were hoping for, though there were extenuating circumstances. A knee injury cost him five games, and then when he returned, because of other injuries up front, the coaching staff asked him to play out of position on the edge for a few games and that stunted his growth as an interior player.

Sanders played 331 snaps counting the postseason and he had just one sack - that in the regular-season finale against the Jets - 14 QB pressures, 16 tackles and one deflected pass. DT is always a tough position to accrue statistics, but Sanders rarely flashed as either a pass rusher or run stuffer, and that was always a concern for a 297-pounder playing in the middle of an NFL defensive line.

Third round: DE Landon Jackson

It was a waste of a season for the No. 72 pick. He struggled throughout training camp and the preseason and once the regular season began, he couldn’t get a game day jersey as he was a healthy scratch in the first four games.

He played against the Patriots and Falcons, was inactive the next two games, then on the second snap he played against the Dolphins in Week 10, he blew out his knee which ended his season. Thus, the Bills got 30 snaps, on which he did not have a sack, pressure or tackle. Yikes.

Fourth round: DT Deone Walker

Unlike the undersized Sanders, Walker brought 330 pounds of bulk to the inside, yet he was every bit as athletic as Sanders both as a pass rusher and run stopper. There were notable inconsistencies in his game which you would expect from a fourth-round rookie, but Walker made a number of splash plays that portend a bright future.

He came to the team with a worrisome back injury which cost him money in the draft, but he played in all 19 games, a total of 549 snaps which were the most of any DT on the team and trailing only Bosa and Greg Rousseau on the D-line. He finished fifth on the team with 20 QB pressures and fifth with 20 stops which PFF defines as a tackle that caused a failure for the offense.

Walker also had a sack, an interception, three pass deflections, and a fumble recovery. His run defense was spotty, not because he missed tackles but because he was too often pushed out of his gap. He shined in the pass game and pairing him with Ed Oliver on pass downs next season could be really interesting.

Fifth round: DB Jordan Hancock

He came to the Bills as a diverse piece who could play CB, NCB and safety. As a rookie, 132 of his 183 defensive snaps came at free safety, usually as an injury replacement for either Taylor Rapp or Jordan Poyer. In his minimal playing time, it was clear he has a lot to learn before the Bills can trust him on an every-down basis, but with Rapp and Poyer probably not returning, he’ll have a chance to win a position next to Cole Bishop in 2026, or maybe as a potential replacement for Taron Johnson at nickel.

Fifth round: TE Jackson Hawes

He was considered the best blocking TE in the 2025 draft, and that proved to be the case. He was a beast, one of the best among all TEs in the NFL, and several opponents commented on how dynamic a blocker Hawes was. If the Bills move on from pricey Dawson Knox, Hawes figures to get a huge snap count bump playing with Dalton Kincaid in two-TE sets.

No one thought much of his pass catching in college, but he was reliable the few times Allen threw his way. Hawes finished with 16 catches on 19 targets for 187 yards and three TDs. His success rate - plays where he gained the necessary yardage to keep the Bills in favorable down-and-distance - was a team-best 78.9%.

Sixth round: CB Dorian Strong

Strong had a solid camp and preseason and he earned the starting nod in Week 1 when both White and Hairston were sidelined. Unfortunately, he played in just three games before suffering a season-ending neck injury, and when he was asked about it during the season, former coach Sean McDermott seemed to indicate that Strong’s future in the game could be impacted. We’ll have to wait and see.

Sixth round: OL Chase Lundt

It was a bit of a surprise that he made the 53-man roster, but the Bills apparently didn’t want to risk putting him on the practice squad where he could be poached. Lundt was inactive for all but two games before a knee injury landed him on injured reserve in December. He’ll have a chance to compete for a backup job in 2026, but to project him as a future starter is a stretch.

Seventh round: WR Kaden Prather

He suffered a hamstring injury in training camp and was eventually waived with an injury settlement. He worked out for the Falcons when he was healthy but was not signed, and he’s a free agent entering 2026, a longshot to find a job.","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/08/PROC/86036896007-getty-images-2234230720.jpg?crop=3557,2001,x0,y185&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-24 13:59:33.713469

Little did they know then that the veteran signal calling, who has not thrown an NFL pass in over two seasons, would be the one who could help get them to a Super Bowl.

""Stiddy's been waiting for this moment for the entirety of his career,"" said Broncos offensive tackle Mike McGlinchey. ""He's more prepared than anybody would be in this situation.

Bo Nix is out for the rest of the season with a broken bone in his ankle.

It'll be up to Stidham to navigate Denver past the New England Patriots, the team he was drafted by in 2019 and spent his first three NFL seasons.

While a long shot, Broncos running back J.K. Dobbins, how since Week 10 with a foot injury, has been limited in practice this week.

The Patriots don't have any major injury concerns, but could potentially get back Mack Hollins. The wide receiver has missed four games with an abdominal injury, but the team designated him for return from injured reserve this week. Hollins was limited during Thursday's practice.

—no_such_thing_as_nothing","last offseason the ownership group decided that they weren’t going to float much cash during free agency, they had other priorities for their cash at that time like expanding their burgeoning soccer empire in the land of beans for breakfast.

is that still the case this year? economists will tell you that a future dollar is worth less than a today dollar, but if you look at the grand total over time paying a signing bonus today reduces the amount you have to pay against the cap in the future, eventually you always end up paying the amount of the salary cap (unless you become a team that lets the rollover expire instead of applying it to the next salary cap here, and even then you can only give up like 10% of a cap).

I know they argued last year that they had been paying out cash for signing bonuses for several years in a row and they needed to take a break, and maybe that money you waste on signing bonuses isn’t the best football strategy.. but they weren’t making that decision because of the best football strategy, they made that decision because the ownership was messing around with their side gig. is that just how things are now, even if the front office wants to attack free agency and UDFAs, ownership doesn’t want to pay up front because they have other plans for their cash?

because if it’s really about getting younger and cheaper and not dabbling in kickyball in the birthplace of ,pudding, and they would have been much bigger players in the undrafted free agent market, which they weren’t last year. for a team that’s playing its fourth string in the playoffs undrafted free agency really matters.

The first notable thing is the situation around J.K. Dobbins. Head coach Sean Payton would not confirm if he’ll be playing earlier today, but now that the final injury report is out we can see he is ruled out for this game. That was something we were all hoping would not be the case, but he did continue to practice so if Denver can get past the Patriots we might see him on the field for the Super Bowl.

Good news on the Pat Bryant front, though. Payton confirmed that he had no concussion symptoms the day after and he’s had his helmet upgraded. I’m assuming that means the padded larger-sized helmet. I’m cool with that. Anything to help him stay safe and out there helping the team win.

For the Patriots, they will be down their team sack leader with outside linebacker Harold Landry being ruled out for the game. Anything that helps keep Jarrett Stidham in a clean pocket is welcome news and hopefully this means he’ll get more help on interior protection assignments.

As in the regular season just ended — and many seasons before that — producer Jim Rikhoff and director Mike Arnold will be at the front bench. Despite adding cameras, replay machines, and other technology for the New England Patriots–Denver Broncos matchup, the core philosophy remains unchanged: keep the focus on the game. Or, as Rikhoff puts it, “The better the game, the less I do.”

SVG sat down with Rikhoff and Arnold to discuss how they’re preparing for their final NFL broadcast of the season, the high SkyCam and other cameras added for the playoffs, the impact of the pregame national anthem and postgame trophy presentation, and how Bo Nix’s injury instantly transformed the narrative for this weekend’s game.

As you look ahead to Sunday, how does your overall production philosophy change from a regular-season game? How do you go about providing that “big game feel” to a broadcast like the AFC Championship?

Rikhoff: Overall, our philosophy doesn’t change that much. Our primary objective is always to cover the football game itself. We don’t ever want to force production elements, and, in the playoffs, we might even be even a little more judicious with those production elements. If the game is good, I just stay out of the way and let Mike cut the game. The better the game, the less I do, and often, I believe, less is more — especially in the playoffs. We could do six games with all the [production elements] we have, so we leave a lot of great stuff out.

I would say 90% of our coverage is exactly what we do on a normal regular-season game, but those added cameras, tape machines, and technology are there for those few special moments that you might not have in a regular-season game. In a playoff game or a Super Bowl, you want to make sure you have every possible angle covered for that huge play that everyone is going to remember. I feel very confident that we have just that going into Sunday.

Any specific examples of the cameras and technologies you have added for the playoffs?

Rikhoff: We add technical equipment as the playoffs go on, and the high SkyCam is probably the biggest addition. Last week, we used seven or eight angles from that, and it was really successful. Tony [Romo] loves to draw on the Telestrator, which gives us another angle. Now we have a slash angle, the All-22, the conventional SkyCam, and the high SkyCam. That’s four angles to show people what happened on the field, which allows us to mix it up a lot more.

And we have other really cool things, like Sky Dry. Those little things and tweaks can make a difference in a big game like this.

How about you, Mike. Does your philosophy change with an AFC Championship Game like this weekend’s broadcast?

Arnold: As Jim said, our core coverage is going to be 90% the same, but the added cameras and EVS machines will show up in subtle ways. We have added a couple of mini [cams] on each sideline to maybe get that reaction shot of a quarterback or a coach or a defensive player on the bench that we wouldn’t have had otherwise. We have added two more low–end-zone [cameras] on each side for a total of four. That allows us to have one low–end-zone following in front of the ball and one behind the play. Those are going to give us some replay looks that we wouldn’t have had.

What does your prep schedule look like this week leading up to Sunday?

Rikhoff: On Tuesday mornings, we have a big production meeting on Zoom and briefly review what we did well and didn’t do well the week before. Then we talk about all the production elements, storylines, and matchups for [the upcoming week]. We’ll come up with ideas for specialty graphics, tape packages, historical vignettes, and those kinds of things. That gets the ball rolling, and the ADs and the BAs start creating all that [content].

On Wednesdays, I start writing out a full schedule for the show. I’ll also start to work on the opener and talk to Jim Nantz, Tony, and Mike to get their feedback. I put together a list of 10-15 major storylines, which I call our golden list. I always say, “Don’t do the game you prepare for; do the game that unfolds.” It’s a live event so you can’t be overly structured.

Saturday, Mike and I will go out to the trucks in the morning. We’ll look at all the new graphics and check out a lot of the new technology and make sure everything’s working. We’ll have a production meeting at our hotel to go through the open, look at all the graphics, look at all the tape, and talk about schedules.

Sunday will be really busy. Now we have THE NFL TODAY+ streaming show and THE NFL TODAY, which is on for two hours, and then we have a 3½-hour game. You’re looking at a seven-hour day of coverage.

Finally, when [the game kicks] off, I take a deep breath and just relax because that’s the fun part and is what I’ve been waiting for all week.

Mike, does your weekly routine look different from an average week’s?

Arnold: There are pieces of this game that we don’t normally do, like covering the anthem and the postgame trophy presentation. We have to have an entire meeting on where the singer will be located, who is singing, if it’s one person or a chorus, which way they’re facing.

For the postgame trophy ceremony, now it’s always on the field. Same questions: where will the stage be, and which way will it be facing? We need to make sure our cameras have access into the pen area.

And, as Jim mentioned, we have THE NFL TODAY+ and THE NFL TODAY onsite. We need to figure out which cameras we’re sharing with those shows and make sure [camera operators and technicians] are scheduled correctly so they don’t burn out before the game even starts. Logistics are a much bigger part of the AFC Championship Game than on a regular game.

Any other big changes to your show on Sunday compared with the regular season?

Rikhoff: Aside from the anthem and the trophy presentation, the other big thing we do is add Evan Washburn [as a second sideline reporter]. That means we have options, but we want to ensure there is balance.

I think the defining thing about our game telecasts is that every week looks different because we react to the game. For me, that’s the best part of the job: we react to the game that happens. To me, the better the game is, the less I have to do. I can just get out of the way and let Jim and Tony, Tracy and Evan, and Mike do their thing.

How do you integrate all the technology that you have at your fingertips without overwhelming the broadcast

Arnold: We try to add technology where it makes sense but never add it just for the sake of adding technology. For example, we added a wind graphic last week, and, even though it wasn’t that windy in Denver, the graphic showed that the wind wouldn’t affect the kick. It was additive to the broadcast.

Rikhoff: Fortunately for us, Patty Power, [EVP, Operations and Engineering]; Jason Cohen, [SVP, Remote Technical Operations]; Craig Stevens, [VP, Remote Engineering]; and their team are always 100% supportive of what we do, and it’s up to us to use all this technology smartly. A lot of [using technology] is just being patient and waiting for the right moment.

What are you looking forward to this weekend specifically, and what are the key storylines you’ll be keeping a close eye on

Rikhoff: When we heard the news about Broncos quarterback Bo Nix’s injury, it was kind of a gut punch because we were all excited about these two great young quarterbacks facing off. But you adapt and find a new hook, which is now you have this journeyman kid, Jarett Stidham, who hasn’t thrown a pass in the NFL since 2023, playing in the biggest game of his life. There have been only seven guys that started their first game of the season in the playoffs and only one that won the game. This is a great story, and we’ll build it up.

Arnold: I’m looking forward to what I hope will be a good, close, competitive game. We’ve had two great ones so far, and, hopefully, our luck continues on Sunday. It’s a unique environment there in Denver, and I expect it to be another great game for us.

Not included in either group? Cornerback Carlton Davis.

Davis was limited the first two practice of the week, and was wearing a red non-contact jersey as he went through concussion protocol. Not having an injury status on the report indicates he was cleared and is good to go. That's a big boost to the Patriots' secondary, with Davis able to line up on the opposite boundary of Christian Gonzalez, with Marcus Jones in the slot.

Also removed from the injury report was center Garrett Bradbury. Bradbury missed practice with an illness on Thursday, but returned as a full participant on Friday.

Among the three questionable players, only linebacker Marte Mapu (hip) is currently on the active roster. Mapu missed practice Wednesday and Thursday, but returned as was limited on Friday.

The other three players who are questionable - running back Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol), wide receiver Mack Hollins (abdomen), and defensive tackle Joshua Farmer (hamstring) - are all currently on IR but designated to return. In order to be eligible to play on Sunday, any or all of the players would have to be officially activated by 4 p.m. ET on Saturday. The Patriots would need to open up a roster spot in order to make that happen.

Meanwhile, edge rusher Harold Landry (knee) was the lone player ruled out for the game on Friday. Landry has been dealing with that knee injury for most of the season, and played just 11 snaps in the Divisional Round win over the Houston Texans last weekend.

For the Broncos, they ruled out four players including running back J.K. Dobbins (foot). Dobbins was the team's leading rusher this year, but has been on IR since early November with that foot injury. He returned to practice this week and was limited all three days, but Denver will be without him for this one. RJ Harvey has handled most of the running back snaps in Dobbins' absence.

Denver could get a couple of other key offensive players back. Wide receiver Pat Bryant (concussion) was not given an injury designation, likely meaning similar to Davis he's cleared the protocol. Fellow wideout Troy Franklin (hamstring) also left last week's game early, but is questionable after being limited all week. Center Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) is questionable after being a full participant all week - he was also designated to return from IR this week.",https://985thesportshub.com/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2249267966.jpg?auto=webp,N,,2026-01-24 12:01:14.829696

Rankings from 2 of the top 5 most accurate analysts … including #1

Ravens Hire Jesse Minter as Head Coach

Baltimore moved quickly to secure Jesse Minter as its next head coach, turning to a familiar face with deep Harbaugh roots and a defensive resume that’s been quietly elite. Minter spent the last two seasons running Jim Harbaugh’s defense with the Chargers after previously doing the same at Michigan, and his NFL ties go back to John Harbaugh’s staff from 2017 through 2020. At just 42, Minter brings continuity, aggression and modern structure to a Ravens team that still believes defense can drive winning. The next key move will be offensive coordinator, where Bills OC Joe Brady and former Commanders OC Kliff Kingsbury are already being floated as names to watch. From a fantasy angle, this hire keeps Baltimore’s defensive identity intact while putting pressure on the OC hire to fully unlock Lamar Jackson’s ceiling.

Bills Cast Wide Net in Head Coaching Search

Buffalo continues to explore every lane in its search for a new head coach, completing an interview with former Giants head coach Brian Daboll and sitting down with Colts defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo while also bringing offensive coordinator Joe Brady in for an internal meeting. Daboll’s history with Josh Allen from 2018 to 2021 remains the cleanest schematic fit, as Buffalo finished top five in yards and points during that stretch, while Anarumo offers a defense-first alternative after spending 2025 running Indianapolis’ unit following his Bengals tenure. Brady remains the continuity option after two seasons as Bills OC, but the volume and variety of interviews suggest the organization is seriously weighing whether to double down on offense or pivot philosophically after moving on from Sean McDermott.

Coordinator Carousel Spins Across the League

Three coordinator hires came together quickly as teams reshuffled their staffs ahead of 2026, with the Buccaneers finalizing a deal for Falcons offensive coordinator Zac Robinson, the Cowboys hiring Eagles defensive backs coach Christian Parker as defensive coordinator, and the Falcons bringing in Browns offensive coordinator Tommy Rees. Robinson arrives in Tampa after two run-leaning seasons in Atlanta that quietly propped up the ground game despite quarterback instability, making him an intriguing fit for Baker Mayfield and Bucky Irving. Parker steps into Dallas as a Fangio-influenced defensive mind at just 34 years old after working under Vic Fangio in Philadelphia, while Rees reunites with Kevin Stefanski in Atlanta after interviewing for Cleveland’s head coaching job and falling just short. None of these moves scream splash, but each signals a clear organizational direction heading into the offseason.

Dolphins Signal Full Reset at Quarterback

Dolphins general manager Jon-Eric Sullivan made it clear that Miami is starting from scratch under center, openly stating the team needs to find its long-term answer at quarterback. Sullivan emphasized building infrastructure first, while acknowledging that Tua Tagovailoa, Quinn Ewers or someone not currently in the building could eventually take the reins. The comments strongly suggest Tagovailoa is headed toward a post-June 1 release, while Ewers could be moved if the right offer materializes. From a fantasy lens, this points to volatility in Miami’s offense for 2026, especially until clarity emerges at the most important position.

Injury Ward

Sam Darnold (oblique) was limited Thursday but remains firmly on track to start for Seattle in the NFC Championship Game against the Rams. Darnold threw at practice and has consistently played through the injury, though the matchup history is concerning after six interceptions in two meetings with Los Angeles this season.

J.K. Dobbins (foot) remained limited for Denver as he continues working back from a Lisfranc injury suffered in Week 10. He’s trending toward questionable status and would need a full practice to truly feel safe for the AFC Championship Game.

Pat Bryant (concussion) practiced fully and is trending toward clearance for Denver’s matchup with New England. The rookie played a meaningful role early last week and should again be involved if he avoids a setback.

Troy Franklin (hamstring) was limited after exiting last week’s game early, leaving his availability in doubt. Hamstring injuries are notoriously tricky, and his status is one to monitor closely through the final report.

Mack Hollins (abdomen) was designated to return from injured reserve by New England and resumed practicing, giving him a chance to suit up this weekend. His return could squeeze snaps for Kayshon Boutte, though Boutte’s strong postseason showing may keep him on the field regardless.

The stage is set, the coaching market keeps moving, and the margins only get thinner from here. As Championship Sunday approaches, every personnel decision and injury update carries weight well beyond this weekend. We’ll be back tomorrow to keep breaking it all down as the league races toward the Super Bowl.

NFL Daily Dive — Jan. 22, 2026

The postseason spotlight keeps narrowing, but the news cycle doesn’t. Front offices are making franchise-defining decisions, coaching searches are taking shape, and roster news is already bleeding into how 2026 will be evaluated. With Championship Sunday approaching, here’s a full rundown of everything that moved across the league in the last 24 hours and why it matters.

Bills Cast a Wide Net Post-McDermott

Buffalo continued its exhaustive head coaching search, completing an interview with offensive coordinator Joe Brady while also lining up or requesting interviews with Anthony Lynn, Anthony Weaver, Brian Daboll, Grant Udinski and Lou Anarumo, a group that spans continuity, familiarity, youth and defensive philosophy. Brady offers the smoothest transition for Josh Allen after two seasons running the offense, Daboll brings history from Allen’s developmental years, Udinski represents a sharp pivot toward a modern passing-centric identity, while Lynn and Weaver would signal a broader cultural reset. The common thread is urgency, as the Bills appear determined to maximize the remaining prime years of Allen rather than simply maintaining competitiveness.

Josh Allen May Need Offseason Surgery

Speaking of Allen, Bills president of football operations Brandon Beane acknowledged that Allen could require offseason foot surgery stemming from an injury suffered late in the regular season, though he expressed confidence it will not impact Allen’s availability for spring work. Allen gutted through the injury during the postseason and remains the centerpiece of Buffalo’s championship window, but the situation bears monitoring as the Bills reshape their coaching staff.

Ravens Zero in on Jesse Minter

Baltimore completed a second interview with Chargers defensive coordinator Minter, reinforcing his status as one of the leading candidates for the job. Minter’s familiarity with the organization and his recent defensive success continue to stand out, though the Ravens have not rushed the process and still have other candidates under consideration. If hired, Minter would inherit a roster built to win now, making this one of the more immediately impactful coaching decisions of the cycle.

Browns Target Youth at Head Coach

Cleveland has reportedly identified Rams pass game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase and Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski as finalists for its head coaching vacancy, signaling a clear preference for a younger, offense-forward hire. Both candidates fit the profile of a long-term builder rather than a stabilizer, and while the situation remains fluid, the Browns appear committed to modernizing their offensive identity after years of inconsistency at quarterback and play-caller.

Raiders Lean Offensive with Top Pick Looming

League chatter suggests the Raiders are prioritizing an offensive-minded head coach to pair with what is expected to be the top overall pick, with Klint Kubiak and Davis Webb frequently mentioned while Jesse Minter remains loosely connected. With Tom Brady involved in the decision-making process and a rookie quarterback likely entering the building, Las Vegas appears focused on finding a coach who can grow alongside a young passer rather than resetting again in two years.

Vikings Lock in Brian Flores … Kind of

Minnesota signed defensive coordinator Flores to a contract extension, ensuring continuity if he does not land a head coaching job this cycle. Flores remains a candidate for openings elsewhere, but the Vikings have guaranteed stability on the defensive side after back-to-back top-10 finishes, a move that preserves their identity regardless of how the rest of the coaching market shakes out.

Brandon Aiyuk Headed for a New Team

49ers general manager John Lynch confirmed Aiyuk has played his final snap in San Francisco after the team voided future guarantees in his contract. Despite signing a massive extension just one year ago, Aiyuk is expected to hit the open market, with early speculation pointing toward Washington or Pittsburgh. His departure creates significant ripple effects for both San Francisco’s offense and fantasy managers evaluating his next landing spot.

Injury Ward

Sam Darnold (oblique) was limited in Wednesday’s practice but remains on track to start the NFC Championship Game after showing no visible limitations last week despite minimal throwing leading up to kickoff.

George Holani (hamstring) was activated from injured reserve by Seattle and is expected to operate as Kenneth Walker III’s primary backup, with a chance to see rotational work this week following Zach Charbonnet’s season-ending injury.

J.K. Dobbins (foot) returned to practice after being designated to return from injured reserve and has a legitimate chance to be activated for the AFC Championship, though his role alongside the existing backfield remains uncertain.

Pat Bryant (concussion) practiced Wednesday and is trending toward availability after exiting last week’s game, putting him on track to play if he clears protocol.

Bo Nix (ankle) underwent successful surgery and will miss the remainder of the postseason, shifting Denver’s offense to Jarrett Stidham while setting Nix up for a full offseason recovery.

The coaching carousel is tightening, roster decisions are accelerating, and the ripple effects are already reshaping how we think about 2026. The next few days won’t just decide who advances, they’ll determine who controls the league’s future.",https://dmxvtdt4jwgem.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Troy-Franklin.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 23:59:21.578898

Buffalo is searching for a new head coach after firing Sean McDermott last week.","The Buffalo Bills interviewed Philip Rivers for their vacant head coaching job, the team confirmed Friday.

Rivers, 44, came out of retirement this season to be the Indianapolis Colts' quarterback after an injury to starter Daniel Jones. He is currently the head coach at St. Michael Catholic High School and has held the job since 2021. He's compiled a 43-15 record during his tenure.

The Bills are the first team to interview him in this year's head coaching cycle. If he gets the job, Rivers would be the first full-time NFL head coach without previous college or pro coaching experience since 1961, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. The Colts hired Jeff Saturday on an interim basis with the same lack of experience in 2022.

Rivers went 0-3 in three starts with Indianapolis this season, completing 63% of his throws for 544 yards and four touchdowns. He was selected fourth overall by the New York Giants in the 2004 draft, but he was packaged in a trade to the then-San Diego Chargers for Eli Manning after Manning refused to play for the Chargers organization.

Rivers is an eight-time Pro Bowler who accumulated almost 64,000 passing yards during his 18-year NFL career. The NC State product led the league in passing yards in 2008 and earned the Comeback Player of the Year award in 2013.

He joins a Bills interview list that includes Mike McDaniel, Joe Brady, and Brian Daboll.

Pearsall's emerging on-field chemistry with quarterback Brock Purdy was promising, and many speculated he would be the first-string replacement for the absent Brandon Aiyuk. However, the 25-year-old was one of the many 49ers players to find himself on the 49ers' inevitable injured reserve list.

He missed eight weeks and the NFC Wild Card win over the Philadelphia Eagles with a lingering knee injury from Week 4 against the Jacksonville Jaguars and an ankle injury from an illegal hit in Week 15 against the Tennessee Titans. Rookie safety Kevin Winston Jr. was ultimately fined by the NFL for the rough hip-drop tackle on Pearsall.

Coach Kyle Shanahan downplayed any concerns that the young wide receiver is ""injury prone"" during the end-of-the-season press conference on Wednesday.

""I think if you guys saw the film or you saw his stats, the stats did match the film,"" he said. ""I think he was leading the league in a lot of categories before he got hurt, I want to say versus Jacksonville, and then he landed on his knee the wrong way.""

He noted that Pearsall made improvements the previous offseason before coming into 2025 training camp, ""Added some weight, was able to get through a training camp because he did train the right way, and that's why I thought he went into those first few weeks of the season ready to go,"" he praised.

Shanahan further shared his thoughts on how Pearsall could be better prepared for the 2026 season.

""So, I think the main thing from last year is, man, what can we do to come back from that faster? When you do come back, what can we do to maybe not redo it, so it doesn't linger?"" he said.

Shanahan also admitted Pearsall played to his full potential in just four of the nine regular-season games he suited up for, and that his aggravated Week 4 PCL injury was a huge obstacle.

""Even though I think he might have dressed in eight, but he was Ricky for four games and that didn't have to do with how he went into this year, that had to do with an injury that he had in Week 4,"" he said.

The upcoming offseason will be detrimental to how the 49ers structure their future receiver roster. Brandon Aiyuk has most likely played his last snap with the team and veteran Jauan Jennings is a hot target for the upcoming free agency market.

It's the same tune the Seahawks QB sang in the lead up to last week's Divisional Round win over the 49ers after popping up on the injury report following Seattle's final practice, which led to a surprising questionable game status.

Linebacker Harold Landry III has been ruled out for Sunday's game, according to Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel. Cornerback Carlton Davis, wide receiver Mack Hollins, and linebacker Marte Mapu will all be listed as questionable heading into Denver.

Landry III had two tackles against the Houston Texans in last week's playoff game. He's been battling a knee injury and led the Patriots with 8.5 sacks on the season.

Davis had a monster game against the Texans, making 4 tackles to go with 2 interceptions. He sustained a head injury in the game.

Davis has played admirably as the man opposite of Pro Bowl cornerback Christian Gonzalez.

Hollins is working his way back from an abdominal injury that landed him on the injured reserve list in late December.

He was spotted at practice working with the receivers for the first time on Thursday.

The 6'4"" Hollins was a reliable target for quarterback Drake Maye with 46 catches on the year for 550 yards and 2 touchdowns.

He is also a reliable blocker in the run game.

Mapu played one defensive snap in each of the Patriots' previous two playoff games and has mostly been a special teams and rotational player for New England.

The Patriots have a strong offense, ranked third overall, while the Broncos boast the league's second-best defense.

Vrabel said the key to winning on Sunday will be consistency.

Patriots quarterback Drake Maye threw three touchdown passes last week.

Denver's defense led the league with 68 sacks this season. Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham is making his first start since 2023 with Bo Nix out with an ankle injury. He is 1-3 in his four NFL starts.

Vrabel is attempting to become the eighth coach in NFL history to reach the Super Bowl in his first season with a team.

Both teams are coming off big wins, with the Patriots defeating the Texans and the Chargers.

The Broncos have a 4-1 edge in the playoff matchups between the teams, winning all four games in Denver. The two most recent meetings were in the AFC championship games during the 2013 and 2015 seasons, and were both won by the Broncos.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gettyimages-2256100320-6973c5ac92f73.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.846xh;0,0.0634xh&resize=1200:*",N,,2026-01-24 01:58:16.523093

Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald added that Darnold ""did great"" in practice this week. ""Everything's going to plan, let's put it that way. He's going to play, and we'll take it day by day.""

In other positive injury news, the Seahawks will have left tackle Charles Cross for Sunday's game despite a foot injury that kept him out of practice on Wednesday and Thursday. Cross was a full participant in Friday's practice and does not have a game status designation on the final injury report, meaning he is good to go.

""Charles practiced today,"" Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said. ""He's getting better, but he should be able to play.""

Cross, who exited Saturday's win over the 49ers due to the injury, said, ""I feel good. Really just leaned on my preparation, getting mental reps this week, understanding the gameplan, just being ready to play fast and execute.

""I feel like the week went really well. I was working with the athletic training staff, creating a plan. Being ready for Sunday was the goal and I feel like we executed it, so the plan is to go out and play Sunday.""

Josh Jones, who started the final three games of the regular season in place of an injured Cross, but missed Saturday's game with a knee injury, was also a full participant in Friday's practice and is listed as questionable.

The Seahawks activated running back George Holani and tight end Elijah Arroyo from injured reserve earlier in the day and neither has a game status, indicating they're ready to play.

New England Patriots at Denver Broncos (3 p.m. ET)

DEN QB Bo Nix (ankle, out for season)

DEN WR Troy Franklin (hamstring, questionable)

No injury has more of an impact on betting lines this weekend than Bo Nix. Nix, Denver's starting quarterback, broke a bone in his ankle late in Denver's overtime win over Buffalo last week. He's out for the rest of the postseason after needing surgery, and the Broncos now turn to backup Jarrett Stidham under center. Stidham hasn't started a game since Week 18 of the 2023 season, and he notably was drafted by Denver's opponent, the Patriots, back in 2019. Second-year standout receiver Troy Franklin is also questionable with a hamstring injury.

The Patriots are favored by 4.5 points on the road due in large part to the Nix injury. The total is 42.5.

Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (6:30 p.m. ET)

SEA QB Sam Darnold (oblique, will play)

SEA RB Zach Charbonnet (ACL, out for season)

The Seahawks got a bit of a scare at practice last week when Sam Darnold suffered an oblique injury that resulted in a questionable game status, but the veteran quarterback played as Seattle blew out the 49ers. That blowout likely helped keep Darnold healthier, as the Seahawks leaned on the run game while Darnold sat out most of the fourth quarter with the game out of reach. Darnold and the Seahawks won't have one of their top playmakers on offense, however, as Zach Charbonnet tore his ACL last week. He's been Seattle's go-to guy in the red zone, leading the team with 12 rushing scores. More focus will be on Kenneth Walker III to carry the load in the run game, and the team activated second-year back George Holani from injured reserve on Friday to serve as the No. 2 back behind Walker on Sunday.

Seattle is a 2.5-point favorite at home. The total is 46.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/17/bc544dde-9640-4b68-abe4-262d4f249dc7/thumbnail/1200x675/fdc1bd993e94aea20db2ab8962d171b8/bo-nix-denver-broncos-imagn-images.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 19:59:14.492584

Manning, who became the Longhorns’ full-time starting quarterback in 2025 and helped them to a 10-3 record, underwent the procedure as a preventative measure, the school said. It did not disclose the nature of Manning’s previous injury, but said he is expected to be back during spring football.

In 2025, Manning started all 13 games, throwing for 3,163 yards and 26 touchdowns with seven interceptions. He was also the team’s second-leading rusher, with 399 yards and 10 scores on the ground.

Manning, who entered 2025 as the Heisman Trophy favorite according to oddsmakers, shook off a rough start to the season with a strong second half, accounting for 20 touchdowns with just two turnovers in his final six games. He led Texas to three consecutive wins to close out the year, including an upset over then-undefeated Texas A&M in the regular-season finale and a win over a ranked Michigan in the Citrus Bowl. Manning won MVP honors for the bowl game.

Manning is one of six Texas players who had offseason surgery to address various issues. Receivers Ryan Wingo (wrist) and Emmett Mosley V (ankle), left tackle Trevor Goosby (shoulder), linebacker Ty’Anthony Smith (shoulder) and defensive back Xavier Filsaime (shoulder) each have had procedures to address injuries since the season ended. Wingo, Mosley, Goosby, Smith and Filsaime are all expected to be back and 100 percent healthy by the start of the season, the school said.

Texas finished No. 12 in the final Associated Press Top 25 but missed the College Football Playoff after entering the 2025 season No. 1 in the poll. Expectations will again be high in 2026. The Longhorns debuted at No. 5 in The Athletic’s Way-Too-Early Top 25 for the 2026 season.

His yardage total ranked fifth in the NFL at the time of his injury, and his mark of 5 yards per carry was seventh among running backs with at least 100 rush attempts at that point. Despite missing the final seven games of the regular season, Dobbins still finished as Denver’s leading rusher with 232 yards more than rookie replacement R.J. Harvey. The Broncos ranked ninth in rushing before the Dobbins injury (128.6 yards per game), but they were 23rd (104.6) after he went down.

Denver’s other running backs, Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin, rushed for 41 yards on just 10 carries in Saturday’s win against the Buffalo Bills. They may need to be a bigger part of the equation Sunday as the Broncos start Jarrett Stidham at quarterback in place of Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury at the end of that divisional round victory.

The Broncos will have rookie wide receiver Pat Bryant available against the Patriots. The third-round pick caught a pass on each of the three snaps he played against the Bills in Denver’s divisional round victory Saturday, but he suffered a concussion after the third of those receptions, his second such head injury in the past month. Bryant cleared the league’s concussion protocol this week, practicing in a limited fashion on Wednesday and then as a full participant on Thursday and Friday. Fellow wide receiver Troy Franklin, who practiced on a limited basis this week after leaving in the second quarter of the game against the Bills with a hamstring injury, is questionable.

Center Luke Wattenberg, who practiced in full this week for the first time since landing on injured reserve with a shoulder injury in Week 16, is listed as questionable. The Broncos would need to clear a roster spot to activate Wattenberg ahead of Sunday’s game. That would likely be done by placing Nix on injured reserve, as expected.

Backup center Alex Forsyth, who filled in as the starter during Wattenberg’s injury but exited late in the game against the Bills with an ankle issue, is also listed as questionable. Safety and core special teams player JL Skinner popped up on the injury report Friday with a quad injury and is also questionable.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/15161433/DobbinsJK-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-23 19:02:05.760130

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold (oblique) and left tackle Charles Cross (foot) are both considered good to go for Sunday’s NFC title game against the Los Angeles Rams, as neither carried a game status designation on Friday’s injury report.

Seahawks make their move at RB ahead of NFC Championship

Darnold was limited in practice all week, but that was expected as he continues to manage an oblique injury that cropped up on Jan. 15. Darnold was listed as questionable heading into last weekend’s divisional round playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers, but started and played into the fourth quarter of Seattle’s 41-6 rout.

Cross, who suffered a foot injury in the third quarter of the divisional round game, was upgraded to a full participant in Friday’s practice after sitting out Wednesday and Thursday.

Rams’ sack leader questionable for NFC title game vs Seahawks

Cross being healthy enough to start Sunday is particularly important, given that Seattle’s top two backup left tackle options are both dealing with injuries as well.

Backup left tackle Josh Jones (knee, ankle) is listed as questionable, while third-string rookie left tackle Amari Kight (knee) is doubtful. Jones was a full participant on Friday after sitting out practice Wednesday and Thursday. Kight was sidelined from practice all week.

Meanwhile, rookie fullback Robbie Ouzts (neck) is questionable and reserve linebacker/special teams player Chazz Surratt (ankle) was ruled out.

Philip Rivers' reemergence into the NFL could continue on the sidelines in 2026. The Buffalo Bills are interviewing Rivers on Friday for their head coaching job, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported, per sources.

Broncos quarterback Jarrett Stidham hasn't started a game since 2023 and has attempted just 197 passes since entering the NFL in 2019, but the Patriots aren't taking their former fourth-round pick lightly ahead of Sunday.

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold threw 14 interceptions in 2025. Six of those came in two games against the Los Angeles Rams.

The New York Giants hired John Harbaugh, whose Ravens made the postseason in 12 of 18 seasons, to help develop second-year quarterback Jaxson Dart.

On Friday, New England ruled OLB Harold Landry III out after weeks of battling through a knee injury. The Patriots also listed WR Mack Hollins (abdomen), LB Marte Mapu (hip), DL Joshua Farmer (hamstring), and RB Terrell Jennings (concussion protocol) as questionable. After being in the league's concussion protocol this week, CB Carlton Davis III was cleared to play and won't carry an injury designation into Sunday's game in Denver.

Hollins opened his 21-day window to be activated off injured reserve by returning to practice on Thursday and was a full participant in Friday's session. The versatile wideout hasn't played since sustaining an abdomen injury in the Patriots win over the Ravens in Week 16, a blow to the offense due to Hollins' size, catch radius, and blocking ability. Hollins allows the Patriots to blur the lines between three-receiver groupings and two-receiver formations as a blocking chess piece in the run game. He is also a big target for QB Drake Maye on vertical routes and routes over the middle of the field, where his catch radius shines, with Maye looking very comfortable throwing to Hollins.

The veteran wideout finished the regular season third on the team in receptions (46) and fourth in receiving yards (550), while leading all Patriots wide receivers with 657 snaps due to his versatile skill set. Although other factors are involved, such as stingy defenses on the other side, the Patriots offense ranks 10th among 14 playoff teams in EPA per play in the playoffs, compared to a league-best +0.155 EPA per play in the regular season. During their two postseason games, Hollins has been missed, so getting him back for Sunday's championship game in Denver would be a massive boost for the Patriots offense.

As for Landry, the Pats captain tried to play through a knee injury in the postseason, but the injury will cause him to miss Sunday's game. In New England's first two playoff games, Landry has only played 27.4% of the defensive snaps, logging two total pressures and one run stuff. The Patriots have relied on veteran Anfernee Jennings and rookie Elijah Ponder in Landry's left defensive end spot opposite top edge-rusher K'Lavon Chaisson. Although he's a team leader, Jennings and Ponder have been effective filling in for Landry, so one would expect that the Patriots will continue to give the bulk of the snaps to those two.

The other bit of injury news is that starting CB Carlton Davis III cleared the league's concussion protocol on Friday – he's good to go. After intercepting two passes in the first half, Davis exited last week's win over the Texans in the fourth quarter. The Pats starting cornerback practiced in a red non-contact jersey in New England's first two practices but shed the red jersey as a full participant in Friday's practice. On Friday afternoon, Davis was cleared to play on Sunday.

Next, the Patriots might need to do some maneuvering on special teams because of an injury to LB Marte Mapu. Mapu plays on five different special teams units, including serving as the personal protector on punt protection. New England hasn't had a blocked punt this season, with special teams coordinator Jeremy Springer praising Mapu's ability to make the protection calls. If he can't play, the Patriots will need a new personal protector for P Bryce Baringer without Mapu on Sunday.

As for Denver, the Broncos ruled out starting QB Bo Nix (ankle) and backup QB Jarrett Stidham will start, as expected. Along with Nix, top RB J.K. Dobbins, who was attempting to return off injured reserve from a foot injury, was also ruled out by the Broncos. With their lead-back healthy, the Broncos were 10th in rush EPA in the first nine weeks of the season. Without Dobbins, the Broncos are only 22nd in rush EPA since Week 10. Last week, Denver's running backs only rushed 10 times for 41 yards against the Bills. The Broncos also listed starting C Luke Wattenberg (shoulder) and WR Troy Franklin (hamstring) as questionable. On a positive note for the Broncos, WR Pat Bryant cleared concussion protocol and is good to go for Sunday's playoff matchup.

New England could also decide to activate RB Terrell Jennings and DT Joshua Farmer from injured reserve. The first-year running back cleared concussion protocol earlier this week. Before his injury, Jennings was the Patriots third running back and a primary kickoff returner, a role that has gone to veteran RB D'Ernest Johnson in recent weeks. Farmer, a fourth-round draft choice, was a rotational defensive lineman during the regular season. But the Patriots have gotten contributions from DT Leonard Taylor III during the postseason.

With all those eligible to return off injured reserve this week, both teams have until 4 p.m. ET on Saturday to activate them. It's worth noting that the Patriots roster is full, so they'd need to free up a roster spot with a corresponding move. New England can elevate two players from the practice squad by Saturday's deadline, elevations that have gone to Johnson and Taylor in the Patriots first two playoff games.

Harold Landry, who led the Patriots with 8.5 sacks this season, will miss the game in Denver, coach Mike Vrabel said, due to a knee injury that has lingered the last few weeks. Landry didn’t practice this week.

It’s a big blow for a Patriots pass rush that will face a Broncos offensive line that’s among the NFL’s best.

Since the Patriots got healthier on defense at the end of the regular season, their pass rush has greatly improved, and they’ve notched nine sacks this postseason (though none were from Landry). They’ve also blitzed at a higher rate in the playoffs than in the regular season, which could continue with Broncos backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham starting in place of the injured Bo Nix on Sunday.

Nix was one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL at avoiding sacks, but less is known about Stidham’s ability in that area. He has started just four games in the league, but he will benefit from playing behind a great Broncos O-line led by left tackle Garrett Bolles and right guard Quinn Meinerz.

The Patriots’ secondary has been one of the best in the NFL in the second half of the season, and when they’ve combined that with a good pass rush in the playoffs, they’ve been dominant. Now, their pass rush takes a hit without Landry.

Still, Anfernee Jennings has played well in Landry’s place and should see a bump in playing time Sunday. Additionally, the Patriots will ask for more from their interior pass rush with Milton Williams and Christian Barmore in the middle.

The good news from the Patriots on Friday is that wide receiver Mack Hollins is questionable to play after landing on injured reserve at the end of the regular season due to an abdominal injury.

It's the same tune the Seahawks QB sang in the lead up to last week's Divisional Round win over the 49ers after popping up on the injury report following Seattle's final practice, which led to a surprising questionable game status.

Seattle's blowout victory, prompted by a 95-yard return in the opening kickoff by Rashid Shaheed and an outstanding defensive effort, allowed for a stress-free start from Darnold, who completed 12 of 17 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown. By the end of his first career playoff win, Darnold was able to rest on the sideline midway through the fourth quarter, giving backup QB Drew Lock some snaps.

Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said this week that Darnold wouldn't throw every ball on every play in practice this week as a precaution, an effort to ensure Seattle's starting QB is as healthy as possible.

Darnold enters the NFC title game having struggled against the Rams this season, throwing six interceptions in two games. But the veteran QB boasts an even 1-1 record after leading a remarkable comeback win over L.A. that included a touchdown pass and game-winning two-point conversion throw in overtime.

One win away from making their first Super Bowl since 2014, Darnold and Co. are scheduled to kick off against the Rams at 6:30 p.m. ET on Sunday.",,N,,2026-01-23 19:59:28.485134

Gill-Howard won't be back with the Red Raiders next season regardless. He announced on Friday, Jan. 23, he's declaring for this spring's NFL draft.

Shortly afterward, a Texas Tech athletics spokesman said Gill-Howard's waiver request for an additional year of eligibility had been denied by the NCAA. The 2025 season was Gill-Howard's fifth in college football after he spent 2021 at Upper Iowa, an NCAA Division II program, and 2022 through 2024 at Northern Illinois.

Typically, a player can't receive a medically related eligibility clock extension if he's played in more than 30% of his team's regular-season games.

Gill-Howard started the first six games of the 2025 season, his first with Texas Tech after he transferred from NIU. He suffered a lower-leg injury in the first quarter of the Oct. 11 game against Kansas, underwent surgery and didn't play again the rest of the reason. He was credited with 13 tackles, including 2 1/2 tackles for loss and returned an interception 55 yards for a touchdown against Kent State.

In addition to Gill-Howard, Tech loses starting defensive tackle Lee Hunter, who received second-team all-America recognition from the Football Writers Association of America and third-team honors from The Associated Press, and rotation player Dooda Banks. Three other defensive tackles — Amier Washington, Kasen Long and Tanner Allen — have had their names in the NCAA transfer portal this month.

The Red Raiders also will be without returning defensive tackle Jayden Cofield for an indefinite period after he suffered a lower-leg injury on New Year's Day in the Orange Bowl and underwent surgery.

The Tech staff already has been at work this month rebuilding the defensive tackles unit. It has landed four from the transfer portal: Julien Laventure from Akron, Bryce Butler from Washington, Mateen Ibirogba from Wake Forest and JoJo Johnson from Oregon State.

The Red Raiders' returning cast of defensive tackles is headed by second-team All-American A.J. Holmes. The other defensive tackles from the 2025 roster with eligibility remaining are Keyshawn Williams, who'll be a sophomore, and Dylan Singleton, who'll be a redshirt freshman.

Chris Shula's defense has rattled the Seattle Seahawks quarterback.

He's also been sacked 16 times in that span, tied for most.

Four of the second-year safety's six career INTs have come against Seattle. He was asked if the Seahawks are his favorite team to face.

""Yes,"" Kinchens said, ""Because they like to test the secondary. They have good receivers and Sam Darnold wants to throw the ball down the field and push it down the field.

""That's a lot of opportunities, and I love when I get to show people my receiver skills.""

The Rams know that to get a chance at those picks, they must pressure Darnold.

""No rush,"" cornerback Cobie Durant said. ""No picks.""

Darnold, who is dealing with an oblique injury, has been excellent in his first season in Seattle, but pressure can force issues.

Of Darnold's 20 giveaways, 11 came under pressure in 2025 (tied for most with Joe Flacco). Six of the QB's interceptions came under pressure, tied for fourth-most. Per Next Gen Stats, Darnold was pressured on just 29.4 percent of dropbacks, sixth-lowest in the league, but 7.2 percent of those dropbacks under pressure resulted in a giveaway, tops in 2025.

The Rams pressured opponents on 38.0 percent of dropbacks (fifth-highest). In Week 11, they pressured Darnold on 28.9 percent of his dropbacks, with a 33.3 percent rate in Week 16. Per NGS, Darnold had a 26.7 passer rating under pressure against the Rams in 2025, with 5.4 yards per attempt, zero TDs and three INTs. Not under pressure, those numbers leaped to 7.7 YPA, two TDs, three INTs and an 83.2 passer rating.

The Rams acutely used stunts and pressure schemes to rattle Darnold. In the third meeting, Shula knows Seattle will be ready for what he throws at the QB.

Outside linebacker Harold Landry III has been ruled out for the AFC Championship Game after staying sidelined for three consecutive practices due to a lingering knee injury, head coach Mike Vrabel announced Friday.

But wide receiver Mack Hollins, inside linebacker Marte Mapu and cornerback Carlton Davis III will head from Foxborough to Mile High with questionable game statuses.

Here’s the early, final injury report leading up to Sunday’s 3 p.m. ET kickoff at Empower Field.

In 15 games, Landry finished the regular season atop the Patriots with 8.5 sacks and 19 quarterback hits. His 10 tackles for loss also tied for the team lead. But a knee injury has kept the veteran outside linebacker on the injury report since fall met winter. And in the divisional round, after being a non-participant last Friday, he played 11 out of 75 defensive snaps while carrying a questionable game designation.

After staying sidelined for consecutive sessions with a hip issue, Mapu was back for New England’s in-stadium practice. The core linebacker has handled 32 snaps in the kicking game since the start of the postseason, while Davis intercepted the initial two passes of his stay last weekend before entering the NFL’s concussion protocol. The veteran cornerback shed the red non-contact jersey on Friday after being a limited participant for back-to-back practices.

As for the third questionable status, the Patriots opened Hollins’ 21-day practice window midway through Broncos prep. The starting receiver, who went on injured reserve due to an abdomen injury in December, missed four games before joining the limited participants. Leading the depth chart in offensive snaps at the time of his injury, he stood with 46 receptions for 550 yards and two touchdowns.

The conference’s No. 2 seed currently stands with a full 53-man roster. Along with Hollins, running back Terrell Jennings and defensive tackle Joshua Farmer also await potential activations from injured reserve.

When Berube appeared for the Leafs’ morning skate and media availability, he was sporting a heavily swollen black eye. The full extent of the injury wasn’t known until Berube took off his hat to reveal a horrific-looking abrasion on the top of his head that required a dozen stitches. The culprit: “an accident in the gym.”

“The other guy looks way worse. There was three of them,” Berube said, smiling.

The Leafs coach is no stranger to being banged up. Before his coaching career, Berube was a bona fide pugilist and still ranks seventh all-time in NHL penalty minutes.

As for additional details on the gym accident?

“I’m not going to talk about it. Nobody needs to know. It’s all good,” Berube said.

When Berube pulled off his hat, his stitches drew groans from the assembled media.

“It was just a bad accident. It’s on me. My fault. I’m fine,” Berube said.

As is often the case with Berube, he took a lighthearted approach to his injury. He said the players laughed about his stitches and black eye.

“It was stupid,” Berube said of his gym accident.

As the team gathered to stretch at the end of Friday’s morning skate, Berube asked in jest whether they all preferred him to keep his blue Leafs cap on, covering up some of the damage, or take it off. He briefly lifted the hat to show them what they were missing, with a typically big grin.

Berube’s injury will end up being another story on what will be a newsworthy day for the Leafs.

Marner will play his first game in Toronto after nine seasons as a star for the Maple Leafs. After a contentious final season in Toronto, Marner was moved to the Golden Knights as part of a sign-and-trade deal before free agency last year. His return makes for arguably the most anticipated regular-season game for the Leafs this season. A frosty return from Leafs fans inside Scotiabank Arena is a real possibility.

Berube also made news Friday morning when he revealed that he was giving Anthony Stolarz his first start in the Maple Leafs goal since Nov. 11. Stolarz has been out with what he called a nerve issue.

The Longhorns described the procedure as ""minor"" and ""preventative,"" and Manning is expected to be ready for spring practice.

""Arch Manning underwent minor foot surgery this week as a preventative measure to address a previous injury,"" Texas said in a statement. ""He will be limited during off-season workouts but is expected back during spring football.""

After entering the 2024 season as a Heisman Trophy favorite on the preseason No. 1 team, Manning got off to a slow start. However, Manning found his groove in the second half of the season and his numbers reflected a major turnaround. In the last six games, which included wins over Texas A&M and Michigan, Manning completed 62.3% of his passes for 1,714 yards, 14 touchdowns and two interceptions. He also rushed for 206 yards and five scores.

Arch's father, Cooper Manning, recently spoke with CBS Sports and described what it was like to watch his son grow exponentially from Week 1 through bowl season.

""I was really glad to see him get better every week,"" Cooper Manning said. ""I think your confidence grows as you play more games. You learn how to win some games in the fourth quarter, and maybe when you didn't have your best stuff. I think it's fun to watch your kids mature, but it's also fun to watch an athlete mature and start playing their best football as the season ends.""

That late surge has already elevated expectations for the Longhorns' 2026 season. Texas has the third-best odds to win the national championship (+700), tied with Indiana, per FanDuel Sportsbook. When it comes to Heisman Trophy odds, Manning (+800) is tied atop the odds board with Notre Dame quarterback C.J. Carr.

Manning wasn't the only Texas player to undergo a recent surgery. Five other players -- defensive back Xavier Filsaime (shoulder), tackle Trevor Goosby (shoulder), receiver Emmett Mosley V (ankle), linebacker Ty'Anthony Smith (shoulder) and receiver Ryan Wingo (wrist) -- had offseason surgeries but are expected to return in time for the start of the 2026 season. Goosby is a starter at left tackle for the Longhorns while Wingo and Mosley are the team's top two returning receivers.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/23/8179ea70-03e9-4119-9218-cb472c8906e4/thumbnail/1200x675/03e17d185317fa66a26ae8982c869580/gettyimages-2254221595-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 18:00:47.548290

Yet the AFC championship game serves as the undercard this weekend. The main event is in the NFC, where the league’s two best teams will have their highly anticipated rubber match.

Let’s dive into these two matchups. All lines are from FanDuel as of Friday morning.

AFC Championship Game

New England Patriots (–4.5) at Denver Broncos

The hypothetical lookahead line had the Broncos listed as a 1.5-point home favorite. Lookahead numbers aren’t a perfect proxy for true market sentiment, but a 6-point adjustment from Bo Nix to Jarrett Stidham still feels aggressive.

Stidham hasn’t played much over the past three seasons as the backup in Denver, but he’s been in the building and is well-versed in Sean Payton’s offense. And while Nix has been serviceable and clutch in late-game situations, he hasn’t exactly been lighting up defenses. He’s averaging just 6.4 yards per attempt—32nd out of 42 qualified quarterbacks. It’s not unreasonable to think that Payton could get similar efficiency out of Stidham—at least for one game.

But that doesn’t mean the two are interchangeable. The real separator between the two isn’t explosive playmaking, but sack avoidance. Nix owns the lowest sack rate in the NFL at 3.5 percent, while Stidham’s career sack rate of 8.8 percent is more than double that.

New England’s defense has been getting after quarterbacks this postseason, but that may be because they faced two truly awful offensive lines in the first two rounds. This matchup presents a very different challenge. Denver boasts an elite offensive line that ranks fifth in pressure rate allowed. If you add that to a potentially run-heavy approach and quick passing game, and if Payton can keep the offense on schedule and keep Stidham upright, it’s hard to justify a downgrade this severe.

On the other side of the ball, the Bills were able to exploit some weaknesses in the heart of the Broncos’ run defense last week. James Cook ran for 117 yards on 24 carries and became the second player this season to run for 100 yards on the Broncos defense. The problem for New England is that they are considerably less set up to exploit that weakness on paper. The Patriots rank 24th in rushing success rate and also struggle with consistency on interior runs. Most of the Patriots’ best run plays have been explosives on the perimeter.

My other concern for New England is pass protection. In a game that projects to be low scoring, avoiding negative plays will be paramount. Maye has made some big-time throws in his first two playoff starts, but he’s also been under constant duress and has not handled that pressure well. This postseason his pressure-to-sack rate is 52.6 percent. That’s more than 20 percentage points higher than any other playoff quarterback. The Texans’ pass rush completely took over the game and Denver’s is just as capable of wreaking havoc and stopping the Patriots offense.

New England has the league’s most efficient downfield passing offense—but now they’ll face a defense that is elite at getting pressure and top four in EPA per dropback allowed against passes 15-plus yards downfield.

The Broncos and Payton will need to get creative if they want to win this game. They can try to rely on the running game, and even get Marvin Mims Jr. active on handoffs. Not only did I bet his over 2.5 rush yards at +120 (we only need one decent carry), but I’m grabbing the points with Denver +4.5.

NFC Championship Game

Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (–2.5)

Whoever wins this game will be a healthy favorite in Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara. The Seahawks and Rams have been the two best teams in the NFL for the second half of the season.

In Week 11, the Rams were a three-point home favorite against the Seahawks. Bettors felt that Los Angeles was a marginally better team, and the Rams won by two. By Week 16 in Seattle, the gap was gone, and the Seahawks were slight 1.5-point home favorites. They won by one in arguably the best game of the entire regular season.

Mike Macdonald’s Seattle defense has continued to smother its opponents—including in two consecutive dominant performances against Kyle Shanahan and the 49ers. If you include the playoffs in the data set, the 2025-26 Seahawks now have the most efficient defense in the league (by EPA per drive) since the start of the 2021 season. They surpassed the 2023 Ravens, whom Macdonald had also coordinated.

The superlatives don’t end there. Seattle has one of the five best rush defenses of the past decade, and because it can get pressure with four rushers, Macdonald doesn’t have to blitz consistently and risk Matthew Stafford carving them open. Because Seattle doesn’t bring a lot of pressure, it usually plays two-high safeties on defense. It’s a main reason why running backs and tight ends have had so many receptions against them, and why I think this is an excellent matchup for the Rams to use their 13 personnel (one back and three tight ends) to generate mismatches in the middle of the field. Rams tight end Colby Parkinson’s receiving yards total is 22.5, and he’s the player I’m betting to go over.

The Seahawks’ biggest advantage on offense all season has been in play-action. They have the third-most efficient play-action offense in the NFL and torched the Rams in both of their meetings with those plays. In the first matchup, Sam Darnold made too many mistakes for the team to overcome. The Rams will have corner Emmanuel Forbes in this game after he left the divisional round with an injury, but they’re vulnerable (22nd in EPA allowed) to play-action.

Even though the Seahawks had a dominant rushing offense the past two games, I suspect that had more to do with their opponents than anything else. The Seahawks still do not have an efficient run offense and will now be without running back Zach Charbonnet as they face the very efficient Rams run defense. Ultimately, I don’t expect either offense to have much success running the ball. We could see some pass-heavy game scripts, which would suggest a higher-scoring matchup than the market is indicating.

These two teams have been roughly equal all year long, and I don’t see much of a difference now. I’d grab the 2.5 points with the Rams if I had to pick a side,and will be betting Parkinson over 22.5 yards, too.

Picks against the spread:

Broncos +4.5

Rams +2.5

With rookie starter Bo Nix's season-ending injury, Denver turned to backup Jarrett Stidham, a move that flipped the Broncos from 1.5-point favorites to 5.5-point underdogs against the New England Patriots.

Stidham, a 2019 fourth-round pick by New England -- who spent 2022 with the Las Vegas Raiders before backing up Russell Wilson and Nix in Denver -- hasn't started a game in more than two years. The Corbin, Kentucky, native is 1-3 as an NFL starter and has passed for 1,422 yards, 8 touchdowns and 8 interceptions in 20 career games played.

But some, namely sports card collectors, are bullish on Stidham's sudden upside. According to Card Ladder, a platform that monitors sports card market trends and sales histories, Stidham has had the largest week-over-week value change of any athlete (min. five cards sold), rising 788.48%. Some collectors engage in ""prospecting,"" or buying as early as possible on players they believe will rise in value, hoping to sell high after on-field performance. But Stidham is a known quantity suddenly thrust into a potentially career-defining circumstance.

On Sunday, Stidham will become only the seventh quarterback since starts began being tracked in 1950 to start a playoff game in a season when he didn't start in the regular season.

Being a heartbeat away from the Super Bowl was enough for one collector to spend $2,000 on a Stidham rookie patch autograph card numbered to three on eBay, mere hours after the Nix injury news broke.

Andrew Arnold, owner of Texas' Beast Sports Cards, sold the card. Arnold told ESPN that he picked up the Stidham card during the Dallas Card Show, which ran Jan. 15-18. Arnold wasn't specifically targeting Stidham cards; it was included in a larger lot of ""older cards"" Arnold bought. When Nix got hurt, Arnold immediately put it up for sale.

""I thought it would sell for $1,000 or so, initially, after he was made the starter,"" Arnold told ESPN. ""But [someone] wanted it badly, so they paid the full asking price.""

It's not the most ever publicly paid for a Stidham card, which was $3,300 in April 2020. According to Card Ladder, Stidham's high public price falls far short of the other three starting quarterbacks' playing this weekend: Sam Darnold's, $10,300 in September 2021; Matthew Stafford's, $55,000 in February 2022; and Drake Maye's, $164,700 in November 2025.

There are currently three 1-of-1 Stidham rookie cards for sale on eBay with six-figure asking prices: the non-autographed 2019 Panini Prizm Black Finite ($500,000 or best offer), the on-card autographed 2019 Panini National Treasures NFL shield card ($450,000 or best offer) and the autographed 2019 Panini Prizm Sensational Signatures Black Finite card ($225,000 or best offer).

If Stidham can take Denver to Super Bowl LX in San Francisco, his market might skyrocket.

""At the end of the day, I'm not focused on anything but Sunday, what is my job on each and every play,"" Stidham said Wednesday. ""How can I help my teammates succeed on Sunday? I don't care about anything else other than the next five days and what my job is.""

Broncos head coach Sean Payton endorsed Stidham in the same news conference.

""He's going to rip it, and that'll be our approach,'' Payton said. ""He's got this calm demeanor that suits him well. ... I felt like our [No.] 2 [quarterback] was inside the best 32 [in the league].""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0101%2Fr1272370_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 16:01:26.137669

These franchises are no strangers to one another in postseason play, and Denver has the upper hand there, owning a 4-1 playoff record against New England, including a perfect 4-0 mark at home.

Those trends certainly favor the Broncos, but Denver finds itself as a rare home playoff underdog as the team was dealt a major injury blow last week during the team's overtime win over the Buffalo Bills. Starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury, so the Broncos are turning to veteran backup Jarrett Stidham. Stidham will make his first start since Week 18 of the 2023 season, and he'll do so against the team that drafted him. That's a tall task against a Patriots team that's seen its defense play exceptionally well this postseason. Plus, New England has one of the game's top quarterbacks in Drake Maye leading the charge on the other side of the ball.

So, who comes out on top in this matchup? That's the question we posed to our staff here at CBS Sports. While you may imagine that New England has the advantage due to the Nix injury, it was not a clean sweep in favor of the Patriots. Check out who our staff has winning the AFC Championship.

Location: Empower Field at Mile High (Denver)

TV: CBS | Stream: Paramount+

Odds: Patriots -4.5, O/U 42.5 (odds via DraftKings Sportsbook)

Pete Prisco: I know the Broncos are playing Jarett Stidham for the injured Bo Nix, but Sean Payton will have a plan to make it work and the defense will limit Drake Maye. Broncos to the Super Bowl. Broncos 23, Patriots 21

Tyler Sullivan: The air was taken out of the balloon with this matchup after Bo Nix went down with an ankle injury. Jarrett Stidham has a nice revenge narrative set up for himself as he faces the team that drafted him, but New England's defense should engulf him. So long as Drake Maye protects the football, New England should be back in the Super Bowl. Patriots 24, Broncos 17

John Breech: Drake Maye struggled against one of the best defenses in the NFL last week, and now, he has to once again play one of the best defenses in the NFL, except this time, he has to go on the road. Maye has taken a beating this postseason (he's been sacked 10 times in two games) and it could get worse in Denver where he'll be facing a Broncos defense that recorded the FIFTH-MOST sacks in a single season in NFL history. I have no idea how the Patriots offensive line is going to stop the Broncos' pass-rush. I think Denver will keep this closer than most people are expecting, but New England steals the win. Patriots 20, Broncos 17.

Jordan Dajani: The football gods love Mike Vrabel. His Patriots got to play the easiest strength of schedule since 1999, then took on a hapless Chargers team in the wild-card round followed by the turnover addict C.J. Stroud in the divisional round. Who awaits New England in the conference championship? Jarrett Stidham. Patriots 23, Broncos 17 .

Garrett Podell: New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye led the NFL in completion percentage, yards per pass attempt, passer rating, completion percentage over expected and expected points added (EPA) per dropback in 2025 while fill-in Denver Broncos starting quarterback Jarrett Stidham hasn't thrown a pass all season. Patriots 27, Broncos 13.

Bryan DeArdo: Picking the Patriots feels like a cop out given Bo Nix's injury. But even if Nix was playing, the Patriots would likely still be my pick because of their running game, which should help Drake Maye conquer Denver's mighty defense. Patriots 20, Broncos 10.

J.P. Acosta: I think the Broncos have the ability defensively to make the Pats' life difficult on the offensive side of the ball, but a resurgent Patriots' defense takes advantage of a Nix-less Broncos offense and goes to the Super Bowl. Patriots 21, Broncos 17.

Zach Pereles: The Bo Nix injury is a huge bummer not only for the Broncos, but for any neutral observer; we want to see teams at as close to full strength as possible this late in the season. Still, don't expect this to become some blowout, considering the Broncos have the pass rush to disrupt Drake Maye (who's taken 10 sacks in two postseason games), and Jarrett Stidham likely won't throw four interceptions like C.J. Stroud did. Patriots 20, Broncos 17.

Joel Corry: Losing Bo Nix is too much for the Broncos to overcome. Patriots 27, Broncos 17.

Kyle Stackpole: Jarrett Stidham was one of Sean Payton's first free agent signings after he arrived in Denver in 2023, choosing to play for Payton over other options. He has known Davis Webb -- the team's offensive pass game coordinator and quarterbacks coach -- since he was a teenager. Does any of this mean he'll play well enough to lift Denver to the Super Bowl? No. But wouldn't it be an amazing story if he did? Broncos 24, Patriots 21

Mike Renner: The Patriots look poised to slop their way to the Super Bowl. Both offensive lines look like they'll be overmatched in this one, but Drake Maye has proven that won't stop him from still making plays.

(Meanwhile, for the second season in a row, the Knicks have a good defense when Towns is on the court without Brunson.)","It’s very hard to create a realistic but exciting fake trade in today’s NBA, with a collective bargaining agreement that’s seemingly designed to shred just about every appealing hypothetical that’s run through the trade machine. Tax implications and apron restrictions turn every proposition into a jigsaw puzzle. And that’s before you throw in actual outgoing talent and what every potential buyer needs. Alas, with the deadline less than two weeks away, I’ve bravely taken it upon myself to try to do the impossible. Here are a few compelling hypotheticals that are, at the very least, worth arguing over.

Are the Knicks ready for a Karl-Anthony Towns divorce?

Coming off a magical playoff run in 2025, New York was a popular preseason pick to reach this season’s Finals. Its broad array of high-end complementary talent inspired the most Knicks optimism in decades, particularly with the East being more diluted than usual. (Tyrese Haliburton isn’t around to re-create their darkest nightmare.) But for all the offensive options New York has at its disposal—seemingly unleashed in a more egalitarian system—the inherent flaws that ultimately cut last season short still exist. Last week’s loss against the broken Dallas Mavericks was rock botto for a group that ranks 24th since Christmas in defensive rating, struggles to get stops when its two best players are on the court, and is 3-9 in its past 12 games.

The championship-caliber dynamic duo of Karl-Anthony Towns and Jalen Brunson hasn’t hit the point of no return yet, but one of these two is familiar with seeing his name in trade rumors and can realistically be moved before this deadline. Towns is not the All-NBA big man he was last season. His 3-point percentage has not been this low since he was a rookie. His 2-point percentage is teetering into a ditch, particularly at the rim. The Karate Kid routine against Dallas was almost like a subconscious temper tantrum to release whatever frustrations Towns has felt in new head coach Mike Brown’s system all season long. This doesn’t mean KAT is bad. He’s on the bubble of making his second straight All-Star team, and in competitive minutes, New York is better on both ends when he’s on the court. But, for all the reasons listed above, a breakup may benefit both parties.

Trading him obviously won’t be simple. The Knicks must connect with a team that is interested in Towns, has the contracts to make the deal, and has the type of surrounding talent that will bring New York closer to a Finals appearance. From the outside looking in, it is definitely easier for KAT to work things out with Brown and arrive at some kind of détente. Towns is 30 years old and guaranteed $118 million over the next two season Rumored suitors, like Charlotte, Memphis, and Orlando, either can’t cobble together a package that will grab New York’s attention or don’t have the money to make anything legally work without involving a third team. Enter: a franchise that might not be thinking with a clear head.

Milwaukee Bucks receive: Karl-Anthony Towns

New York Knicks receive: Myles Turner, Kyle Kuzma, and a top-five protected pick in 2031

If your first reaction to this was “That makes no sense,” you are 100 percent correct. A blockbuster trade between New York and Milwaukee that doesn’t include an increasingly melodramatic Giannis Antetokounmpo would belie rational thought. The Bucks should absolutely not do this. But the Bucks should absolutely not have done a bunch of other stuff they thought was a good idea, so let’s operate in that reality for a minute.

New York (marginally) upgrades on defense without sacrificing all the space Towns is able to create as a 3-point-shooting center, and the Bucks receive a vastly superior offensive threat who can prop up their attack when Giannis isn’t on the floor and [chokes back laughter] maybe even give them a puncher’s chance to escape the play-in. Say what you want: Towns is a physically imposing star whose exact skill set is a key ingredient for any team that wants to maximize Antetokounmpo (who lives in the paint and can’t shoot).

If Giannis ultimately refuses to sign an extension this summer, I’d rather have Towns than Turner and Kuzma. The Knicks, meanwhile, add some financial flexibility (Turner will make about $30 million less than Towns in 2028) and get a pretty good asset for the trouble. Their odds to reach the Finals this season would probably dip a little bit, but there’s a definite world where those two work better in New York’s existing rotation. It also opens the door for more trade scenarios over the summer.

To be clear, no sane general manager in the league should give up a first-round pick to take on Towns’s contract. But the Bucks have been operating in an upside-down universe for the past six months. Why not triple down on the mess they’ve made and see what happens?

While we’re talking about the Knicks, if you happen to root for them and have a low tolerance for pain, feel free to cover your eyes and scroll down to the next trade. I know how untenable it would be to even gauge Brunson’s trade value—he’s an All-Star starter who took a pay cut so New York could build a championship-level roster around him—but actually winning it all may not be possible so long as he’s the team’s best player. My mind wanders. What could they get for him? This would almost definitely never happen, but if it did, Knicks fans would absolutely storm Madison Square Garden. When Brunson is on the court, New York’s offensive rating is 8.1 points per 100 possessions above the league average. The only players who rank above him play for the Denver Nuggets.

But he’s also an increasingly problematic defender who will turn 30 in August and seems to be walking off an ankle injury once a week. For the second season in a row, the Knicks have a bad defense when he’s on the court regardless of whether Towns is out there. (Meanwhile, for the second season in a row, the Knicks have a good defense when Towns is on the court without Brunson.)

There may be a path to the Finals that doesn’t go through the player with such a paradoxical impact. As great and beloved as Brunson is, winning a championship with him as your best player is an exceptional challenge—like having the most powerful left hook in the world but stepping into the ring with your right arm tied behind your back. In last year’s playoffs, he ranked first in offensive estimated plus-minus and last in defensive plus-minus. The Knicks obviously aren’t even thinking about cashing out right now, but what if they disappoint during the playoffs? What if there’s a deal out there that can shore up New York’s defense and give the team a ton of draft equity without drowning the offense? Say, something along the lines of Fred VanVleet, Dorian Finney-Smith, and six first-round picks? That sounds ludicrous. Maybe it is! Even if New York’s defensive issues are never resolved with Brunson on the roster, he’s a floor-raising, messianic figure with a universally positive approval rating.

Watching him is fun. It’s an unavoidable dilemma.

The Thunder shouldn’t get cute with their title defense.

Chicago Bulls receive: Ousmane Dieng, Philadelphia’s 2026 top-four-protected pick, and Denver’s 2026 top-five-protected pick

Oklahoma City Thunder receive: Ayo Dosunmu

The pick compensation here sounds like a lot, but it’s actually not that stee when you consider the stakes. Championship windows in the NBA are unpredictable and unforgiving. Even when the runway looks clear and there isn’t a cloud in the sky, the opportunity to acquire a dynamic downhill driver who’s also been one of the better 3-point shooters this season should not be taken for granted.

OKC can afford to take chances—or can’t afford not to, depending on how you look at it—especially under these circumstances. Let’s consider the picks it would give up. The Sixers are pretty good and currently in line to receive the 18th pick in this year’s draft. The Nuggets will pick somewhere in the 20s next year. The Thunder, meanwhile, have Nikola Topic and Thomas Sorber—their two most recent first-round picks—waiting in the wings, and they own the Clippers’ first-round pick in this year’s draft with swap rights in next year’s draft, swap rights with the Dallas Mavericks in 2028, another protected first from Denver in 2029, and approximately 6 million second-round picks incoming from half the league.

There’s always risk as a small-market team surrendering draft capital for a short-term gain (OKC can’t realistically re-sign Dosunmu with Chet Holmgren’s and Jalen Williams’s extensions kicking in next year). But by doing this trade, the Thunder can stay under the tax (not for nothing, considering how close they are to that line and the amount of belt tightening that’s to come) and exchange someone who will never see meaningful minutes in the playoffs for a solid two-way player who’s talented enough to win them a game. Instead of losing Dieng for zilch this summer, they can grab Dosunmu and lessen the downside of another Jalen Williams injury.

If you’re the Bulls, just smile and say thank you. Draft capital and young talent are exactly what this organization is starved for. Dieng is four years younger than Dosunmu and, with both being on expiring contracts, will almost definitely cost a whole lot less going forward.

Should the Celtics make a win-now move?

This isn’t the sexiest name out there, but if the Brooklyn Nets put Day'Ron Sharpe on the trade market, there’s a very good chance they’ll have a bidding war on their hands. The Celtics, Rockets, Lakers, and Raptors are four playoff teams off the top of my head that could really use an inexpensive depth piece to bolster their frontcourts. Sharpe is a magnet for offensive rebounds, sets terrific screens, is comfortable as a hub on the perimeter, and can really see the floor. Few backup bigs are better at making quick reads out of a short roll or turning a second-chance opportunity into a wide-open 3-pointer.

Boston’s odds of making a lengthy playoff run would improve if Sharpe were its backup center. (With all due respect to Luka Garza, there’s a decent chance he’ll get played off the floor in the postseason.) Houston needs some insurance for Steven Adams, and Sharpe is a perfect fit with its crash-the-glass mentality. L.A. is … unserious with Deandre Ayton and Jaxson Hayes. Toronto can’t leave Jakob Poeltl’s back pain to chance.

Like I said, a potential bidding war. Here’s my favorite hypothetical:

Boston Celtics receive: Day’Ron Sharpe and Ziaire Williams

Brooklyn Nets receive: Anfernee Simons and three second-round picks

The on-court upgrade matters a ton, but don’t overlook the financial implications: By doing this, the Celtics duck the luxury tax without hemorrhaging the type of talent that can really help in the playoffs. Simons isn’t bad, but his value will shrink considerably when Jayson Tatum returns; there’s no evidence that he’ll even be playable on the defensive end in a seven-game series.

Now, the Rockets can probably blow this offer out of the water with all the picks and swaps they own (including a swap with the Nets in 2027), but how far would they go here for a backup big with Clint Capela already on the roster? Do the Lakers actually want to win this season? Do the Raptors believe they can? Sharpe is 24 years old and very good at what he does. Someone should go get him. Boston is good enough to try.

The Pistons need to act like the contenders they are.

Detroit Pistons receive: Michael Porter Jr. and Haywood Highsmith

Brooklyn Nets receive: Tobias Harris, Jaden Ivey, and an unprotected first-round pick in 2028

I was a little jealous when my boss Bill Simmons first mentioned Michael Porter Jr. as a logical trade target for the Pistons earlier this month. He’s somehow become the Eastern Conference’s version of Lauri Markkanen, an awesome player whom, since the offseason, I’ve all but begged Detroit to pursue. Fast-forward a few months, and the price for Markkanen is almost definitely too high for a Jazz team that’s starting to gain traction with an intriguing young core. Enter Porter, an A-plus-plus 3-point shooter who accentuates teammates without needing the ball. And unlike Markkanen, he’s logged more than zero seconds of playoff basketball as the third-leading scorer and rebounder on a team that won the championship.

The phrase “all in” is thrown around quite a bit, often incorrectly. This situation certainly doesn’t qualify. The Pistons would part with a reliable veteran and excellent locker-room presence on an expiring contract, an intriguing recent lottery pick who had two major surgeries in a year and hasn’t been a major contributor to this season’s success, and one future first-round pick. That’s not nothing. It also doesn’t come close to eliminating flexibility from a team that owns all of its picks. What it would do, probably, is catapult Detroit’s payroll past the first apron for a player with a checkered injury history. But when you’re a young title contender sitting atop a down conference, shoot your shot. Fortune favors the bold!

All signs point to Detroit being patient at the deadline, and I can understand that logic. As my colleague Zach Lowe said on his podcast earlier this week, the Pistons can do nothing and still reach the Finals. The East is that weak, and patience is typically a mindset I won’t argue with. But I also hope this team isn’t comparing itself to where the Oklahoma City Thunder were a couple of years ago, finishing breakfast as a 1-seed that was eliminated by the Maverick in Round 2. The Pistons ate breakfast a year ago when they nearly beat the Knicks in an extremely competitive first-round slugfest—sans Isaiah Stewart and Ivey!

They should know who they are and what they have. Regular-season dominance does not always guarantee playoff malleability. Porter is not a high-usage ball handler or a traditional second option. What he is, though, is someone who directly assuages Detroit’s primary concern. What this team needs to seriously compete in the playoffs is more shooting. Porter can check off that box with permanent ink. He’s shooting 39.8 percent behind the arc on 9.5 attempts per game. That’s ridiculous on its own, but it gets even more impressive when you learn that 68.7 percent of his catch-and-shoot jumpers are tightly contested, per Sportradar. That puts him in the 100th percentile and helps explain why he ranks seventh in overall gravity.

MPJ can grease the wheels for humongous lineups that will encounter serious spacing issues throughout a seven-game series. Imagine him with Cade Cunningham, Ausar Thompson, Jalen Duren, and Isaiah Stewart. That five-man unit rules. Or you can replace Ausar or Beef Stew with Duncan Robinson and watch Cade frolic through the paint with more room than he’s ever had in his life. Brooklyn’s offensive rating sits in the top 10 with Porter on the court and falls several points below the last-ranked Indiana Pacers when he’s out. That gap makes him one of the most positive difference-makers in the league this season, sandwiched between Donovan Mitchell and Jalen Brunson. (It also puts him just in front of Robinson, which isn’t a coincidence. The Pistons average the fifth-fewest 3s per 100 possessions.)

Given how great MPJ has been this season, there may be better offers out ther but turning Cam Johnson into two unprotected first-round picks, Harris, and Ivey would be a staggeringly impressive sequence of events for a rebuilding team.",https://wp.theringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cropped-KatMustGo_Getty-Ringer-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 15:00:44.439164

Darnold averaged 39 attempts in the first two meetings against the Rams' defense this year.","RENTON, Wash. -- Sam Darnold got sacked, then got up gingerly.

His head coach got nervous.

It was late in the first quarter of Seattle's divisional round matchup against the San Francisco 49ers last Saturday at Lumen Field, and it might have been the only tense moment the Seahawks experienced in a 41-6 win that got them into Sunday's NFC Championship Game against the Los Angeles Rams (6:30 p.m. ET, Fox).

Darnold was playing through an oblique injury he had suffered two days earlier.

The Seahawks and their Pro Bowl quarterback were confident that he'd play despite his questionable designation. But no one could be sure how he'd fare while dealing with the first oblique injury of his career -- or what would happen if he took a bad hit.

Almost 11 minutes into the game, Darnold rolled to his right on a bootleg, then broke into a sprint as a 49ers defender gave chase. When safety Malik Mustapha dropped him from behind, he hit the ground hard, and he appeared to be feeling it as he jogged back to the huddle.

On the next play, Darnold delivered a strike to Cooper Kupp for a 21-yard gain, putting enough zip on the ball to drive it almost 37 yards in the air, and enough touch to layer it over an underneath zone defender.

""That was awesome,"" coach Mike Macdonald said of the throw. ""At that point, I think I exhaled a little bit.""

Darnold would go on to play a mistake-free game, completing 12 of 17 attempts for 124 yards and a touchdown before he was pulled with over nine minutes left. The first playoff victory of his career came two weeks after a 13-3 win over the 49ers in Week 18, which gave the Seahawks a first-round bye as NFC West champions and the conference's No. 1 seed.

Now comes the biggest game of Darnold's career against perhaps his toughest opponent -- with a ticket to Super Bowl LX on the line.

It was the Rams' defense, coordinated by Chris Shula, that sacked Darnold nine times in the wild-card round last January, ending his breakthrough Pro Bowl season with the Minnesota Vikings. Shula's unit then intercepted him four times in the Rams' win over Seattle in November, and twice more in a December rematch before Darnold and the Seahawks rallied to win in overtime.

In four games against the Rams over the past two seasons, Darnold has 5 touchdown passes, 7 interceptions, 16 sacks and a 1-3 record. He has a Total QBR of 34.3 in those games -- his second worst among the 11 opponents he has faced at least twice in that span -- compared with 58.4 in every other game since the start of 2024.

Can Darnold, injured oblique and all, help beat his nemesis a second straight time to put the Seahawks back in the Super Bowl for the first time in 11 years?

""Really good team, really good defense, really good scheme,"" Darnold said. ""Good players. So like always, we're really excited about this opportunity to play these guys. We've just got to have a really good week of practice. For me, I've got to continue to attack all the things that I need to attack, just get ready to play these guys, but also just getting my body right to be ready for Sunday.""

ROUND 1

Darnold's four interceptions in the Seahawks' 21-19 loss against the Rams at SoFi Stadium in Week 11 had one thing in common: They all came under duress.

On the first pick, by safety Kamren Kinchens, Darnold retreated in the pocket and then threw off his back foot to Cooper Kupp. On the next one, he got drilled by outside linebacker Byron Young as he was releasing a throw to Jaxon Smith-Njigba that cornerback Cobie Durant picked off. Kinchens got him a second time as he was trying to hit tight end Elijah Arroyo with the pocket collapsing around him. Darnold attempted a jump throw to Arroyo after navigating another messy pocket when cornerback Darious Williams nabbed interception No. 4.

Darnold wasn't sacked in that game, which may have illustrated the problem. Whether or not he was overly intent on avoiding sacks after taking nine of them against the Rams 10 months earlier -- as Kinchens surmised afterward -- pressure was the common denominator on his four interceptions.

That pressure, combined with the Rams disguising certain looks on the back end of their defense, gave Darnold fits. Afterward, he said he needed to do a better job of recognizing their shell coverages and moving on in his progressions as opposed to locking on to one or two receivers. But the Rams' pass rush made that easier said than done.

""They do a good job of disguising shell [alignment] and all those things,"" Darnold said. ""I feel like their pass rush, their linebackers, their safeties all being on the same page and playing really good football, they do it at a high level. They seem like really smart players. But again, those are self-inflicted wounds, turning the ball over like that. Sometimes it's better just to try to throw the ball away or even take a sack when nothing is there.""

The Seahawks' top-ranked scoring defense kept them in the game long enough for Darnold to mount a comeback. He led an 11-play, 84-yard touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter that got them to within two points. Then, after they took over at their own 1-yard line with one timeout and 1:41 left, he got them in position for a 61-yard field goal that would have won the game as time expired, but Jason Myers missed. Darnold completed 6 of 9 attempts for 43 yards on that drive, which also included a defensive penalty.

""I think that's why he's had such a really good season, because he's the same guy every day,"" offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said. ""Whether he's having success or it's not going as good, he's always the same. He's really impressive on the sideline and ready to move on. That's why he is who he is, and that's how most great quarterbacks are, they just stay the same.""

The Seahawks have not lost since then -- but it took an improbable comeback in the second Rams meeting to keep that streak going.

ROUND 2

The two interceptions Darnold threw in the Week 16 rematch had something else in common.

In the third quarter, cornerback Josh Wallace had followed Kupp in motion into the left slot, often a tell of man coverage. Kupp and outside receiver Rashid Shaheed both ran slant routes from that side of the field. But instead of running with Kupp, Wallace settled right in the path of Darnold's throw to Shaheed.

In the fourth quarter, with the Seahawks facing third-and-goal from the 6-yard line and threatening to cut into the Rams' 16-point lead, Darnold got fooled again. This time, it was by defensive lineman Kobie Turner, who dropped into coverage and picked off Darnold's throw into the end zone to Smith-Njigba.

""They do a lot of really good things defensively,"" Darnold said this week. ""Their scheme is really good. Coach Shula, those guys do a good job coaching those guys up on what to do ... The players make it come to life with certain disguises and pressures.""

What followed Darnold's second interception was a furious comeback from a 30-14 deficit and a wild finish that made Seattle's 38-37 win one of the games of the year.

It started with a punt return touchdown from Shaheed. Seattle's defense, in the midst of allowing 581 yards -- its most in two seasons under Macdonald -- got stops on five straight possessions. Darnold threw a touchdown pass to tight end AJ Barner and converted 2-point attempts after both scores to send the game to overtime, the second one coming when running back Zach Charbonnet grabbed what turned out to be a live ball in the end zone, as other players were walking off the field thinking Darnold's screen pass had fallen incomplete.

Darnold then answered Matthew Stafford's overtime touchdown drive with one of his own, hitting Smith-Njigba in the end zone from 4 yards out. He then won the game with a 2-point conversion to No. 2 tight end Eric Saubert. Darnold completed 4 of 5 attempts for 47 yards on the game-winning drive, plus the 2-point try.

It was the largest fourth-quarter comeback in franchise history, according to ESPN Research. The Seahawks were 0-155-0 when trailing by 16-plus points after three quarters.

""Just shows a true competitor,"" Smith-Njigba said of Darnold. ""A lot of guys would get down on themselves and give up, lay down, but that's not what we do, that's not what he is.""

ROUND 3

Leading up to Sunday's game, the Seahawks listed Darnold as a limited participant in practice Wednesday and Thursday.

Darnold made it clear after the 49ers game last week that he'd ""absolutely"" have to continue to manage his oblique injury, while Macdonald said his throwing would be curtailed this week to that end.

But Kubiak said Thursday, ""He looks like Sam. He looks healthy to me.""

Darnold averaged 39 attempts in the first two meetings against the Rams' defense this year. If the pattern follows, Darnold and his oblique will get more of a test on Sunday than what the 49ers and their shorthanded defense presented last week when Darnold threw 17 times before sitting with the game in hand.

Limiting mistakes against the Rams will be paramount, given how close the two previous games against the Rams have been.

According to ESPN Research, this NFC Championship Game will be the first playoff game in NFL history between teams that played two games against each other in the regular season that were each decided by two points or fewer. The Seahawks combined for 57 points and 830 yards in those matchups, nearly identical totals to the Rams' 58 points and 829 yards.

Darnold and the Seahawks, who enter as 2.5-point favorites, will have the advantage of playing at home. Seattle is 11-1 in playoff games at Lumen Field in the past 20 years. The only loss in that span came to the Rams at the end of the 2020 COVID season, when Seattle had no fans in the stands.

But with a trip to Super Bowl LX on the line, the decibel levels -- and the pressure -- will be high.

The Denver Broncos head coach went viral after calmly backing Jarrett Stidham as his new starting quarterback, telling reporters to “just watch” how the team responds.

Bo Nix had just suffered a serious ankle injury that’s expected to end his rookie season, but Payton showed no hesitation in shifting focus to Stidham.

Kyle Brandt says Sean Payton’s ‘just watch’ moment could become legendary

Speaking on NFL Network’s Good Morning Football, Kyle Brandt said the speech already feels like it could become part of league folklore — especially if Jarrett Stidham thrives in his new role under Sean Payton.

The Denver Broncos face a challenge few teams ever have – competing in the AFC championship game without their starting quarterback.

“I am riveted watching back that Sean Payton speech. It’s been a week now. I found myself watching it, and he’s sitting up there… This is that night! After the game! In the stadium! He just found out the news!”

“It’s an incredible display of poise and confidence. This has potential to be an all-time moment. This has potential to be looked back on as the ‘just watch’ speech. This could age incredibly…”

“There’s nothing about him that is stressed… It’s almost like he was expecting it, or has been expecting it. Have you ever seen someone who found out their franchise quarterback look so calm and cool?…”

“If Jarrett Stidham goes on to do something very special, that speech will go up with the all-timers… I’m getting goosebumps right now. If there is a Jarrett Stidham movie, I will go see it. It starts this weekend.”

Sean Payton’s calm reaction earns league-wide praise

Sean Payton’s calm handling of the situation has drawn praise across the NFL. Even with playoff hopes hanging in the balance, the Denver Broncos coach projected belief in Jarrett Stidham, who now leads the team into the most critical stretch of the season.

If Jarrett Stidham guides the Broncos to a strong finish, the moment could be remembered as one of the most defining in Denver’s modern history.

The Broncos now face the challenge of overcoming the New England Patriots, led by second-year quarterback Drake Maye and one of the league’s top defensive units.

Dak Prescott, quarterback 15.","The Associated Press released its awards finalists Thursday, and great news for Dallas Cowboys fans, quarterback Dak Prescott was on it for good reasons.

The bad news is that he's not a candidate for MVP, which happens when a team goes 7-9-1. He's a finalist for comeback player of the year, which is what happens a year after a major injury. The award finalists, however, did offer a good guess as to who will be the MVP this year and not surprisingly, he's playing this Sunday in a conference championship game.

And the Cowboys have a new defensive coordinator, raiding their rivals, the Philadelphia Eagles, to find him.

Dak Prescott comeback player

Dak Prescott is a finalist for one of the major NFL postseason awards: Associated Press Comeback Player of the Year.

The other finalists are New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, Detroit Lions defensive end Aidan Hutchinson, Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence and San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffery.

The award typically goes to someone coming back from a major injury, and Prescott fits that bill. Last season he played in eight games before a season-ending injury, then came back this season with one of his best years ever.

He was also a finalist for this award in 2021 when he returned from a horrific ankle injury suffered in 2020. In 2021, he was a runner-up to Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow.

Dak Prescott stats

This season, Prescott was 404-of-600 passing for 4,552 yards with 30 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He also added 177 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns. The yards ranked him third in the NFL and his QBR of 70.3 ranked him fifth.

Dallas Cowboys awards

Of the eight NFL postseason awards presented by the Associated Press, Dallas' only representative is Dak Prescott as comeback player of the year. The other categories are MVP, offensive player of the year, defensive player of the year, offensive rookie of the year, defensive rookie of the year, assistant coach of the year and coach of the year.

Notably, Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, the clear betting favorite to win MVP, was not a finalist for offensive player of the year. The same player can't win both awards, and the offensive player of the year is usually a chance to give the award to a non-quarterback, as quarterbacks almost always win MVP.

In fact, the only quarterback to be nominated for offensive player of the year was the New England Patriots' Drake Maye. Translation: Stafford is almost certainly the MVP, and Maye finished second in the MVP voting, which was conducted at the regular season's end.

NFL MVP: Which Cowboys rank in top 100?

The five MVP finalists the Associated Press announced were four quarterbacks (Los Angeles Rams Matthew Stafford, New England Patriots Drake May, Buffalo Bills Josh Allen, Jacksonville Jaguars Trevor Lawrence) and San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffery.

Here is the full list of award finalists.

ESPN's Seth Walder has a very different take and an annual ranking of his top 100, led by Drake Maye. Second? That would be Dak Prescott, who is one of five Cowboys to make the list.

They are:

2. Dak Prescott, quarterback

15. George Pickens, wide receiver

29 Quinnen Williams, defensive tackle

76. Tyler Smith, offensive tackle

79. CeeDee Lamb, receiver

Worth noting, former Dallas edge rusher Micah Parsons, now with Green Bay, ranked 12th despite playing just 14 games.

Dallas Cowboys new defensive coordinator

On Thursday, the Cowboys hired Christian Parker away from the Philadelphia Eagles. He was the pass-game coordinator and defensive backs coach.

Parker began coaching in the NFL in 2019 after six years in the college ranks, starting with Green Bay as a defensive quality control coach for two years before going to Denver as a defensive backs coach in 2021.

Under Parker, Philadelphia ranked first in passing yards allowed in 2024 while giving up 22 passing touchdowns, sixth-fewest in the NFL, and this past season finished eighth in passing yards allowed and first in passing TDs surrendered (14).

Vic Fangio

Philadelphia Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio got good news and bad news Thursday. The good news is that he's one of five finalists for the NFL Assistant of the Year Award. The bad news is that he lost one of his top assistants, passing game coordinator Christian Parker, to the divisional rival Cowboys and now will have to face him as a fellow defensive coordinator.

The other finalists for top NFL assistant are Vikings DC Brian Flores, Minnesota, Broncos DC Vance Joseph, Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak and Patriots OC Josh McDaniels.

The 29-year-old quarterback was an early free agent signing that offseason after Payton came on board. Little did they know then that the veteran signal calling, who has not thrown an NFL pass in over two seasons, would be the one who could help get them to a Super Bowl.

""Stiddy's been waiting for this moment for the entirety of his career,"" said Broncos offensive tackle Mike McGlinchey. ""He's more prepared than anybody would be in this situation. And he can ball, he can flat out play quarterback. We've seen it every day in practice. We've seen it in training camp.

""I have no doubts he's going to go out there and play his butt off.""

Bo Nix is out for the rest of the season with a broken bone in his ankle.

It'll be up to Stidham to navigate Denver past the New England Patriots, the team he was drafted by in 2019 and spent his first three NFL seasons.

While a long shot, Broncos running back J.K. Dobbins, how since Week 10 with a foot injury, has been limited in practice this week.

The Patriots don't have any major injury concerns, but could potentially get back Mack Hollins. The wide receiver has missed four games with an abdominal injury, but the team designated him for return from injured reserve this week. Hollins was limited during Thursday's practice.

One concern was defensive tackle Christian Barmore, whose previous issues with blood clots could have been an issue in the thin Denver air. But head coach Mike Vrabel said it should not be a problem.

""Certainly something we have to monitor,"" Vrabel said. ""There are some players that we'll have to monitor for one reason or another, but I don't see any limitations for Christian.""

While the Seattle Seahawks will be down running back Zach Charbonnet after he tore his ACL last week, quarterback Sam Darnold (oblique) and tackle Charles Cross (foot) should be fine to play. Darnold was limited on Thursday, while Cross did not take part.

The teams split their two regular-season meetings, with the home team winning each time. The Seahawks are 2.5-point favorites, with DraftKings setting the Over/Under at 46.5. Seattle is a -154 favorite, and Los Angeles is priced as a +129 money-line underdog.

Here, we will break down the NFL Conference Championships odds and how they have been affected since lines first opened, with odds courtesy of DraftKings Sportsbook.

Patriots vs. Broncos (Sunday, 3 p.m. ET)

Open: Patriots -5.5, O/U 40.5

Now: Patriots -4.5, O/U 42.5

Denver is covering in 58% of the SportsLine model's simulations. Bet the spread at DraftKings:

The Broncos are going to have to win with a strong running game and a great defense, as Jarrett Stidham will be stepping in for Nix, and the sixth-year pro has just four career starts. The good news is that running back RJ Harvey has 896 total yards at 12 total TDs in his rookie season, and J.K. Dobbins (772 rushing yards in 10 games) has been practicing on a limited basis after a long IR stint. The better news is the Denver defense led the league in sacks in the regular season with 68 (four per game) and has been the driving force for this team all season. The bad news is that New England has one of the NFL's best run defenses, ranking fifth at 101.7 yards per game in the regular season. The Patriots also had the second-highest scoring offense, averaging 28.8 points per game. But the Broncos had the third-best scoring defense (18.3) and are going to make life tough on Pats QB Drake Maye. The fans at Mile High are sure to do their part as well. The SportsLine model is expecting more from the Broncos than oddsmakers are, with Denver covering the spread 58% of the time and winning outright 46% of the time. At a price of +204, the model loves the Broncos on the money line, giving the pick an ""A"" grade. The public has been hitting the Patriots hard, with about 75% of spread bets at DraftKings on New England, dropping the spread to 4.5. The total has bumped up, moving two points with the public likely expecting the Stidham-led offense to provide more chances for Maye and the Pats to add points.

Rams at Seahawks (Sunday, 6:30 p.m. ET)

Open: Seahawks -2.5, O/U 47.5

Now: Seahawks -2.5, O/U 46.5

Seattle is covering in 58% of the SportsLine model's simulations. Bet the spread at DraftKings:

The Seahawks are the favorite to win the Super Bowl, so they're favored here. From past experiences, if they can avoid turnovers they should have no problem beating the Rams again. They gave the ball away seven times in the two regular-season meetings but won the matchup in Seattle and missed a 61-yard field goal that would have won the game in L.A. One question is which type of game this will be, as the first was a 21-19 nail-biter and the second was a 38-37 OT thriller. The Rams had 249 total yards in their home victory but piled up 581 in the second meeting. Seattle had 415 at home and 414 in L.A., so it looks like we know what to expect from the Seahawks offense against a Rams defense that has had some problems. L.A. averaged 30.5 points in the regular season, most in the NFL, but Seattle was third at 28.4. The Seahawks defense allowed the fewest points in the league (17.2) while the Rams were 10th (20.4). The SportsLine model is leaning slightly Under the total, with simulations projecting 46 total points, and has Seattle covering 58% of the time for an ""A"" grade. At DraftKings, 83% of the spread bets and 91% of the handle are on Seattle, while 69% of bettors are on the Over.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/22/153dbba6-2eab-41ae-aa3c-b84ddb0fd16c/thumbnail/1200x675/9e5297d9a50e5224370f7208576bb44e/broncos-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-23 11:42:15.494323

No, not Jarrett Stidham.

Running back J.K. Dobbins. He has been out with a foot injury since Nov. 6 but returned to practice this week. He has been sorely missed, as rookie RJ Harvey has a total of 91 yards rushing on 35 carries in the past three games. Dobbins led the Broncos in rushing in the regular season despite missing seven games. Not only is he a more decisive runner than Harvey, but also Dobbins has a higher percentage of explosive rushes (11 percent to 3 percent) and a lower percentage of rushes for no gain or a loss (14 to 21).

It got us thinking. We picked the Los Angeles Rams to win the Super Bowl before the playoffs began — we’re sticking with that — but in the AFC, we think people are overreacting to the Bo Nix injury news. The Broncos would surely be favored by a couple of points at home if he were playing, and now they’re five-point underdogs?!? I’m not sure Nix’s mom thinks he is worth seven points against the spread.

We’re definitely taking the points … and maybe even the upset at +210. The New England Patriots had a historically easy schedule, then got a Los Angeles Chargers team with a turnstile offensive line in the first round and faced C.J. (stands for Careless Juggler) Stroud last week. They’ll finally get tested here, against a No. 1 seed that gets to play the no-respect card as the largest home underdog in a conference championship since 1968, per Pro Football Reference.

And there’s some value with Stidham …

Last week’s record: 2-2 against the spread, 0-1 on best bets

New England Patriots (-5) at Denver Broncos | 3 p.m. ET Sunday, CBS

A great matchup between two pretty good coaches. There’s the Patriots’ Mike Vrabel, tied for the longest-tenured coach in the AFC East, who is finally carrying his weight after Drake Maye carried Vrabel’s defense the first 16 weeks. There’s the Broncos’ Sean Payton, who was almost smirking after he announced that Nix was out for the season — he feels backup QB Stidham is going to let it rip and surprise some people Sunday.

Not me. I was in the house for Stidham’s two starts with the Las Vegas Raiders in 2022. He can sling it. Think of him as a dirt-poor man’s Brett Favre. Stidham has some swagger and loves to throw the ball into tight windows — he has eight touchdowns and eight interceptions in four career starts. And while he is no Nix, he can run it better than people give him credit for. Stidham won’t be the reason the Broncos lose, as long as Dobbins and even Harvey keep the Patriots’ defense honest.

The Patriots hit the road for the first time in the playoffs, and there will be some pressure on Maye. The second-year QB has already fumbled six times in the playoffs, losing three, and he actually leads the league with 14 on the season. Eleven of those were on strip sacks, tying Matt Ryan (2022) for the most since 2020.

As we mentioned last week (when we picked the Bills and — sigh — they missed covering by only two points despite five turnovers), the once-feared Broncos defense has had some serious slippage the past seven weeks. But … Denver can still get after the quarterback. It has 71 sacks — 14 more than anybody else — in 18 games, and even ranks fourth in pressure rate when not blitzing. Patriots left tackle Will Campbell, meanwhile, has not been the same since coming back from a knee injury, allowing four sacks and 10 pressures in the past two games.

That’s enough for me. There’s also this: Home underdogs of 4 or more points in the playoffs are 9-0 ATS in the past 50 years.

The pick: Broncos

Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-2.5) | 6 p.m. ET Sunday, Fox

The Seahawks hammered the 49ers last week, and their defense is the first to rank in the top two in both yards per rush and yards per pass allowed since the 2015 Super Bowl champ Broncos. Too bad they have to face the Rams.

The teams split their two regular-season meetings, but the Rams won the first game and led 30-14 in the fourth quarter of the second. They forced Sam Darnold to throw six interceptions. It’s a little sad how everyone is waiting for Darnold to crumble, but he does have eight interceptions when pressured this season, tied for most in the NFL.

Darnold has been leaning on his defense, but this is not a good matchup for the Seahawks. Puka Nacua had 19 catches for 300 yards in the two games — the most yards by any player against any single opponent across the league all season — and the mighty Seahawks defense also didn’t sack Matthew Stafford once.

Davante Adams is back for this one, after the Rams scored four touchdowns out of three-tight-end formations in his absence in the last matchup. Only one of those was actually caught by a tight end, but the Seahawks rank 27th in EPA per target to tight ends (-0.4), worst among any team to win a playoff game.

Plus, if you go back to when Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald was the Baltimore Ravens’ defensive coordinator, the Rams under coach Sean McVay are averaging 28 points per game in five meetings against Macdonald’s defenses. Macdonald has otherwise allowed 18 points per game with the Seahawks and 17 with the Ravens.

This also now feels like a battle-tested Rams team after two close wins in the playoffs, and it won’t be fazed at all by playing in Seattle. The Rams have won there in each of the past three seasons.

The pick: Rams

Best bet: We’ll go with the Rams again after they failed to cover by half a point for us last week.

Rams Have Been a Thorn in the Side of Seahawks’ Sam Darnold The Rams gave Darnold the most trouble this 2025 season.
They’re going to bring back all the stats about the Rams’ pressure and how Sam Darnold struggled against it.
And so, as high as we are for the Seattle Seahawks right now, they’re on the moon.
If they can do that let that defense just eat, Seattle Seahawks back in the Super Bowl.”","Sam Darnold is another week removed from his oblique injury that didn’t keep him out of the divisional round playoff game for the Seattle Seahawks. However, the veteran QB wasn’t asked to do much in the win over the San Francisco 49ers.

Darnold completed 12 of 17 passes for 124 passing yards and one touchdown. Seattle had an impressive ground game and special teams to help with the scoring, along with a dominant defense that didn’t allow the 49ers’ offense to accomplish anything.

Now, in the NFC title game, that could be a different story. While the Seahawks might be looking to replicate the same formula against the Los Angeles Rams, Darnold might need to make a couple of more plays to help Seattle punch their ticket to the Super Bowl.

As a result, head coach Mike Macdonald provided the latest injury update on his QB.

“He feels better than he did going into the [49ers] game, and he showed that he could throw [the ball] then,” Macdonald told reporters on Jan. 22. “We’d like him to get some throws before Sunday.”

Kenneth Walker III was all the offense that the Seahawks needed against San Francisco. Walker ran for 116 rushing yards and three touchdowns on the ground. With the injury to Zach Charbonnet, Walker will be counted on even more, along with taking the offensive responsibilities off Darnold’s shoulders.

Rams Have Been a Thorn in the Side of Seahawks’ Sam Darnold

The Rams gave Darnold the most trouble this 2025 season. Darnold had a passer rating of 62.4, 549 passing yards, two touchdowns, and six interceptions in two games against the Rams this season, per StatMuse.

As a result, former Seahawks star Richard Sherman believes that Darnold will need to overcome this hurdle that plagued him this season to get Seattle to Santa Clara for Super Bowl LX.

“If you’re Sam Darnold, you thought you overcame your nightmares with the Rams,“ Sherman said on the Jan. 19 edition of “The Richard Sherman Podcast.” “You thought you had overcome them. You thought, ‘Hey, I only had to see it once. I killed Freddy Krueger. I killed him. He’s dead.’

“… But he’s going to have to overcome. They’re going to bring back all the stats about the Rams’ pressure and how Sam Darnold struggled against it. And so, as high as we are for the Seattle Seahawks right now, they’re on the moon. They are freaking playing lights-out football defensively.”

Sam Darnold Could Have the Confidence to Face Rams

Darnold’s two touchdowns came in the Seahawks’ comeback overtime win on Dec. 18, which put Seattle in the driver’s seat to win the NFC West and secure the No. 1 seed in the conference. Because of that performance late in the regular season, Darnold could have the belief that he can perform well for four quarters against Los Angeles.

“Now, if I’m Sam Darnold, I watched the last drive in the fourth quarter of that game against the Rams, and I feel pretty good, “ Sherman added. “You were cooking with grease. You were James Harden in the clutch, cooking. So, let’s get back to cooking. Run the football. [Kenneth Walker III] is running as good as he has in his entire career.

“Had three touchdowns in the last game, tying Shaun Alexander for the franchise record [in a postseason game]. If they can do that let that defense just eat, Seattle Seahawks back in the Super Bowl.”",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/sam-darnold-seattle-seahawks_768d71.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-23 13:40:57.033498

San Francisco 49ers president of football operations and general manager John Lynch offered clarity about wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk's future with the franchise.

""I think it's safe to say that he's played his last snap with the Niners,"" Lynch said at the team's end-of-season news conference Wednesday.

Lynch went on to acknowledge that the situation with Aiyuk had gone off course.

""It's unfortunate. A situation that just went awry. And I will look long and hard at what could have been done differently, but sometimes it just doesn't work out. And I think that this was a case where that happened.""

While including Aiyuk in a future trade package is not off the table, Lynch suggested the 49ers would be more inclined to release the 27-year-old wideout. Whichever move comes next would end one of the NFL’s most turbulent player-team standoffs.

Aiyuk’s contract dispute lasted through the 2024 training camp. The two sides eventually reached an agreement on a four-year extension in August 2024, shortly before the regular season kicked off.

GEORGE KITTLE’S WIFE SAYS 49ERS STAR WILL RETURN STRONGER AFTER DEVASTATING NFL PLAYOFF INJURY

Just a few weeks later, Aiyuk and 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan engaged in what appeared to be an animated exchange over the color of the receiver’s practice shorts. Players were reportedly instructed to wear black shorts for a Sept. 27 practice, and Aiyuk arrived in red shorts.

Before tearing his ACL, MCL and meniscus in his right knee in October 2024, Aiyuk was not nearly as productive as he had been in past seasons. He finished with 374 receiving yards over seven games. Aiyuk also missed multiple rehab sessions last offseason.

In July 2025, the 49ers decided to void an estimated $27 million in guarantees included in Aiyuk’s contract for 2026. In December, Shanahan said a considerable amount of time had passed without contact from Aiyuk.

""It’s been pretty simple for me. I haven’t seen him in a month,"" the coach told reporters Dec. 15.

On Wednesday, Shanahan offered more details about the unsuccessful attempts to get in touch with Aiyuk.

""I'd say it officially stopped for me when the last time I tried to get ahold of him and couldn't and then tried a couple more times and still couldn't,"" he said. ""And then that matched everyone else that was trying to get ahold of him to come in. And, eventually, there's not much of an explanation because it's really hard for us and anyone else to understand. And that's why it's something I've never seen in 22 years of coaching. It's unfortunate, and it's confusing because it's confusing for all of us. But it eventually becomes 'it is what it is.'""

Aiyuk was moved to the reserve/left team list last month. He did not appear in any 2025 regular-season or playoff games.

Full analysis, timeline of Branch Achilles injury: Visit Jimmy Liao's full Branch injury analysis.

Recovery is expected to take around 10–11 months, likely delaying his return until mid-2026 season, and he’ll likely start training camp on the PUP list. While most players can return after this injury, his long-term performance level isn’t guaranteed—even though some NFL players have had successful comebacks. Branch is 24 years old and under contract through the 2026 season.

Here is an excerpt of my analysis of Branch's injury:

Branch had many minor injuries to his right leg prior to the Achilles rupture. His Achilles may have already been compromised leading up to the moment of rupture. It’s also possible that the injuries in the preceding weeks to surrounding areas caused extra strain on the calf muscle and Achilles tendon.

The Achilles rupture may have been a culmination of all those antecedent factors coupled with the awkward landing mechanism with external rotation strain of the ankle...

A recovery around 10-11 months is the hope, although a long-term injury like this can have a good amount of variation. If he can return in 10 months, then he would be back on the field in October. Starting training camp on PUP (physically unable to perform) list seems likely. - Jimmy Liao MD

Branch was drafted in the second round (45th overall) out of Alabama in 2023. As of January 2026, he has played in 43 regular-season games with career totals of 258 tackles, 38 passes defended, seven interceptions (one returned for a touchdown) and 4.5 sacks.

The 24-year-old earned a Pro Bowl selection in 2024 and was having another good year before his Achilles injury.

However, head coach Mike Macdonald said prior to Thursday’s practice that the team is “optimistic” Cross will be able to start Sunday’s NFC title game against the Los Angeles Rams, while adding that Jones and Kight were “day to day.”

Meanwhile, Pro Bowl quarterback Sam Darnold (oblique) was limited for a second straight day, as expected. Darnold and Macdonald both acknowledged earlier this week that they’ll have to manage his workload as he deals with an oblique injury that he suffered in practice last week.

More on Seahawks’ left tackle situation

Cross’ foot injury came in the third quarter of Seattle’s 41-6 divisional round playoff rout of the San Francisco 49ers last Saturday night.

Cross also missed the final three games of the regular season with a hamstring injury and dealt with a knee injury that he suffered in practice last week. But this week, he’s only listed with the foot injury.

“Charles is good,” Macdonald said prior to Thursday’s practice. “We’ll see how today goes, but we’re optimistic for the game.”

Jones, a veteran swing tackle, started at left tackle in place of Cross for the final three games of the regular season – including in Week 18, when he played through a knee injury. He’s been sidelined from practice since that Week 18 game.

With Jones ruled out for last Saturday’s divisional round game, Kight filled in at left tackle after Cross got hurt. Kight, an undrafted rookie, injured his knee during the game, Macdonald said.

Macdonald declined to elaborate on the Seahawks’ contingency plans in the event none of their top three options at left tackles are available for Sunday.

“We have a plan for it,” Macdonald said. “I don’t really want to say what we’d do, but we have a plan for it.”

T.J. Watt’s season did not end the way anyone in Pittsburgh expected. Just days before the Pro Bowl Game, the Steelers’ defensive leader found himself ruled out with an injury that forced the league into a late change. Watt had earned his ninth Pro Bowl selection after another strong campaign. Still, instead of heading to Orlando, he is now watching from the sidelines as Jacksonville linebacker Devin Lloyd steps into the spotlight.

NFL replaces T.J. Watt with Jaguars LB Devin Lloyd

On Jan 22, 2026, local Jacksonville radio station 1010 XL confirmed on X that Devin Lloyd had been named as Watt’s replacement for the 2026 Pro Bowl Games. “BREAKING: The Jaguars have been awarded another Pro Bowler! Jaguars LB Devin Lloyd has been named to the 2026 Pro Bowl Games in replacement of injured Steelers LB T.J. Watt,” the station posted. The NFL later confirmed the move, citing Watt’s injury as the reason for his withdrawal. While the Steelers have not released detailed medical specifics, team sources said Watt is not medically cleared to participate in any football activity. Watt’s absence closes the book on what had been another productive year for the 30-year-old. During the 2025 regular season, he recorded 7 sacks, 23 solo tackles, 3 forced fumbles, and 2 interceptions, numbers that once again placed him among the league’s most impactful edge rushers. For Lloyd, the call came as a reward for his best season since entering the league. The former first-round pick started 15 games for Jacksonville in 2025 and finished with 81 total tackles, six tackles for loss, one fumble recovery, and multiple game-changing plays in coverage. His biggest moment came in Week 5 against the Kansas City Chiefs, when he returned a Patrick Mahomes interception 99 yards for a touchdown in the Jaguars’ 31-28 win. Lloyd was also named second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press, becoming just the second linebacker in the last two decades to record at least 10 quarterback hits and five interceptions in a single season. Jaguars general manager James Gladstone spoke about Lloyd’s growth during a media interaction at the team’s end-of-season press conference on Jan. 8. “What he meant to our end result was certainly notable,” Gladstone said. “The way he worked every week, the way he connected with the staff, it showed up on Sundays.” Lloyd now joins long snapper Ross Matiscik as the second Jaguars player selected for the Pro Bowl Games this year. For Pittsburgh, Watt’s injury adds to a difficult offseason. Earlier in 2025, Watt signed a three-year, $123 million extension, and during an appearance on the ""Steelers Now"" podcast in July 2025, he admitted his future was closely tied to head coach Mike Tomlin. “I don’t want to play for anyone other than Mike T,” Watt said on the show. With Watt sidelined and uncertainty around the Steelers’ direction, the moment belongs to Lloyd. His Pro Bowl selection does more than fill a vacancy. It confirms his arrival as one of the AFC’s most complete linebackers.

With Steelers star T.J. Watt forced out due to injury, the NFL had to act fast. That sudden decision has now brought good news for Jacksonville, as one Jaguars defender earns a well-deserved shot on football’s big stage. Local radio station 1010 XL / 92.5 FM shared the news on X.

“BREAKING: The Jaguars have been awarded another Pro Bowler!” the tweet read. “Jaguars LB Devin Lloyd has been named to the 2026 Pro Bowl Games in replacement of injured Steelers LB T.J. Watt.”

The announcement quickly gained traction among Jaguars fans.

Lloyd replaces Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt, who was ruled out after reportedly suffering a serious injury during a dry needling session, where a needle caused his lung to collapse. He was hospitalized and later underwent successful surgery, but he is still not healthy enough to return for the Pro Bowl.

Lloyd became just the second player in the last 20 seasons to post at least 10 quarterback hits and five interceptions, joining Lavonte David’s 2013 season. He was also named a second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press. His 99-yard third-quarter interception return for a touchdown off Patrick Mahomes played a big part in the Jaguars’ 31-28 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 5.

Statistically, Lloyd posted his best numbers in his four-year career since being drafted in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft. Starting 15 games, he totalled 81 combined tackles, six tackles for loss, and one fumble recovery. Such figures even earned him the praise of the Jaguars hierarchy.

“Such an impactful season. What he meant to our end result was certainly notable,” Jaguars general manager James Gladstone said. “The way in which he operated on a daily, weekly basis was really cool to watch and observe. He committed himself to being the best version. The connection between him, the coaching staff was real. He was being deployed in the right ways.”

Devin Lloyd has now become the second Jaguars player, after long snapper Ross Matiscik, who was named a starter last month, to make the Pro Bowl Games. Lloyd’s Pro Bowl selection caps a statement season and reinforces the Jaguars’ growing presence among the league’s elite defenders.

As for T.J. Watt, his absence will be a tough blow for Pittsburgh. The linebacker’s future with the Steelers also seems uncertain, after his contract extension included a unique clause.

T.J. Watt’s loyalty to the Steelers is tied to Mike Tomlin

T.J. Watt, the Steelers’ all-time sack leader (115), has made it clear that his loyalty to Pittsburgh was closely tied to head coach Mike Tomlin. When negotiating his 2025 contract extension, Watt reportedly included a clause specifying that he would only play under Tomlin, underscoring the coach’s impact on his decision.

On Monday, Steelers Depot shared a tweet highlighting Watt’s stance on the contract: “It was huge in my contract talks. I don’t want to play for anyone other than Mike T.”

T.J. Watt’s deal with the Steelers wasn’t just about money; it was about trust. The star pass rusher made it clear during 2025 contract talks that he would suit up only if Mike Tomlin remained in charge, showing the coach’s irreplaceable role.

In July 2025, Watt signed a three-year, $123 million extension, making him one of the NFL’s highest-paid defenders. His 2025 regular-season performance underscored his dominance on the field, tallying 23 solo tackles, 7 sacks, 3 forced fumbles, and 2 interceptions.

T.J. Watt’s injury and Mike Tomlin’s departure mark a challenging period for the Steelers, putting both the team’s future and Watt’s commitment in question. While Watt’s dominance on the field is undeniable, his absence opens the door for rising stars like Devin Lloyd, highlighting the ever-changing landscape of the NFL and the impact of leadership on player loyalty.",https://s.yimg.com/os/en/essentiallysports_articles_591/f2aef215ddfac82d82eb6d795a3251c2,N,,2026-01-22 22:39:05.200527

Taking trash out Anybody expecting the Rams to talk trash about the Seahawks will be waiting for a long time.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Rob Havenstein and Tyler Higbee are the only two players who have been on Sean McVay's roster throughout the coach's nine seasons with the Los Angeles Rams.

While Higbee remains an important part of the Rams' offense heading into the third NFC championship game of this McVay era on Sunday, Havenstein took the first step Thursday toward potentially finishing his injury-plagued season on the field as well.

Havenstein rejoined his teammates in practice for the first time since he went down in mid-November, creating the possibility for the longtime starter to return from injured reserve this season. After spending most of the past two months watching from the sideline during practice, Havenstein was back on the field at their training complex in Woodland Hills.

“It was a long road,” Havenstein said. “I had some challenging times, but that’s what this game is. ... I’m focused on what I can do each day back. Haven’t played football in a while in a real capacity, so I’m doing what I can do each day to kind of build, and we’ll see where the chips fall.”

Havenstein is the longest-tenured member of the Rams' current roster and he has been a stalwart starter at right tackle when healthy since his rookie season in St. Louis in 2015. He has started 148 games over 11 seasons for the Rams along with 13 playoff starts, including two Super Bowls.

But injuries have limited Havenstein to 18 games over the past two seasons. He has played in just seven games this season, last appearing in the Rams' 21-19 victory over Seattle at SoFi Stadium in Week 11 before being sidelined by an ankle injury and knee bursitis.

Warren McClendon Jr. has generally played well since replacing Havenstein in the starting lineup this season, although he had a few glaring mistakes in the Rams’ 20-17 overtime victory at Chicago last Sunday in the divisional round. But Havenstein makes it clear he never gave up on playing again this season.

“Whatever it is, you want to do it for your family,” Havenstein said. “I’ve got my 7-year-old (who's) going to ask me why I’m not out there right now, so it’s understanding that, and trying to be the man and the father that I want to be. You’ve got to be about it instead of just talking about it. Staying engaged, staying ready to go, doing what I can, conditioning, extra lifts, extra rehabs, just trying to get back to feeling as good as I can.”

The Rams (14-5) visit the Seahawks (16-3) on Sunday for the NFC title game, hoping to earn a third conference championship for Havenstein and Higbee. McVay led the Rams to the Super Bowl in the 2018 season and the 2021 season — but Higbee only played in one of those games after getting hurt in the NFC title game against San Francisco four years ago.

“Rob and Tyler, these are rare humans,” McVay said Thursday. ""They're great football players, but they're great leaders, and they have such respect from the locker room. ... You look at the wisdom that Rob has in the meeting room to pour into Warren and really our offensive line as a whole. These are two all-time guys. These are legacy Rams. Obviously they're special to me.""

Higbee and Havenstein frequently hold court in their corner of the Rams' locker room, teasing and roasting their younger teammates. Havenstein also takes his role seriously as a leader and mentor, even when he's not healthy enough to play.

“When I was a young guy, I had a lot of guys impart a lot of wisdom on me, so it would be selfish me not to kind of give back what I was taught,” Havenstein said. “If I can help out in a 1% way, then I’ve been doing my job, and that’s what the ‘C’ on my chest still means.”

Injuries

LB Byron Young missed his second straight day of practice to rest the knee injury that has bothered him periodically throughout the season, but McVay expects the Rams' sacks leader to play Sunday.

Taking trash out

Anybody expecting the Rams to talk trash about the Seahawks will be waiting for a long time.

When talkative linebacker Jared Verse took the podium and fielded a question about the Rams' hunger for a payback victory in this rematch, he glanced pointedly at a Rams' public relations staffer and said: “I was told not to give bulletin board material.”

Taking trash out Anybody expecting the Rams to talk trash about the Seahawks will be waiting for a long time.","LOS ANGELES (AP) — Rob Havenstein and Tyler Higbee are the only two players who have been on Sean McVay's roster throughout the coach's nine seasons with the Los Angeles Rams.

While Higbee remains an important part of the Rams' offense heading into the third NFC championship game of this McVay era on Sunday, Havenstein took the first step Thursday toward potentially finishing his injury-plagued season on the field as well.

Havenstein rejoined his teammates in practice for the first time since he went down in mid-November, creating the possibility for the longtime starter to return from injured reserve this season. After spending most of the past two months watching from the sideline during practice, Havenstein was back on the field at their training complex in Woodland Hills.

“It was a long road,” Havenstein said. “I had some challenging times, but that’s what this game is. ... I’m focused on what I can do each day back. Haven’t played football in a while in a real capacity, so I’m doing what I can do each day to kind of build, and we’ll see where the chips fall.”

Havenstein is the longest-tenured member of the Rams' current roster and he has been a stalwart starter at right tackle when healthy since his rookie season in St. Louis in 2015. He has started 148 games over 11 seasons for the Rams along with 13 playoff starts, including two Super Bowls.

But injuries have limited Havenstein to 18 games over the past two seasons. He has played in just seven games this season, last appearing in the Rams' 21-19 victory over Seattle at SoFi Stadium in Week 11 before being sidelined by an ankle injury and knee bursitis.

Warren McClendon Jr. has generally played well since replacing Havenstein in the starting lineup this season, although he had a few glaring mistakes in the Rams’ 20-17 overtime victory at Chicago last Sunday in the divisional round. But Havenstein makes it clear he never gave up on playing again this season.

“Whatever it is, you want to do it for your family,” Havenstein said. “I’ve got my 7-year-old (who's) going to ask me why I’m not out there right now, so it’s understanding that, and trying to be the man and the father that I want to be. You’ve got to be about it instead of just talking about it. Staying engaged, staying ready to go, doing what I can, conditioning, extra lifts, extra rehabs, just trying to get back to feeling as good as I can.”

The Rams (14-5) visit the Seahawks (16-3) on Sunday for the NFC title game, hoping to earn a third conference championship for Havenstein and Higbee. McVay led the Rams to the Super Bowl in the 2018 season and the 2021 season — but Higbee only played in one of those games after getting hurt in the NFC title game against San Francisco four years ago.

“Rob and Tyler, these are rare humans,” McVay said Thursday. ""They're great football players, but they're great leaders, and they have such respect from the locker room. ... You look at the wisdom that Rob has in the meeting room to pour into Warren and really our offensive line as a whole. These are two all-time guys. These are legacy Rams. Obviously they're special to me.""

Higbee and Havenstein frequently hold court in their corner of the Rams' locker room, teasing and roasting their younger teammates. Havenstein also takes his role seriously as a leader and mentor, even when he's not healthy enough to play.

“When I was a young guy, I had a lot of guys impart a lot of wisdom on me, so it would be selfish me not to kind of give back what I was taught,” Havenstein said. “If I can help out in a 1% way, then I’ve been doing my job, and that’s what the ‘C’ on my chest still means.”

Injuries

LB Byron Young missed his second straight day of practice to rest the knee injury that has bothered him periodically throughout the season, but McVay expects the Rams' sacks leader to play Sunday.

Taking trash out

Anybody expecting the Rams to talk trash about the Seahawks will be waiting for a long time.

When talkative linebacker Jared Verse took the podium and fielded a question about the Rams' hunger for a payback victory in this rematch, he glanced pointedly at a Rams' public relations staffer and said: “I was told not to give bulletin board material.”

Seahawks GM Schneider named PFWA’s Executive of the Year

Cross was listed as a non-participant on Wednesday’s practice report after suffering a foot injury in the third quarter of Seattle’s 41-6 divisional round playoff rout of the San Francisco 49ers last Saturday night.

Cross’ foot injury came after he missed the final three games of the regular season with a hamstring injury and also dealt with a knee injury that he suffered in practice last week. But on Wednesday’s practice report, he was only listed with the foot injury.

“Charles is good,” Macdonald said. “We’ll see how today goes, but we’re optimistic for the game.”

Macdonald also said backup left tackle Josh Jones (knee, ankle) and third-string left tackle Amari Kight (knee) are “day to day” after being listed as non-participants in Wednesday’s practice.

Jones, a veteran swing tackle, started at left tackle in place of Cross for the final three games of the regular season – including in Week 18, when he played through a knee injury. He’s been sidelined from practice since that Week 18 game.

With Jones ruled out for last Saturday’s divisional round game, Kight filled in at left tackle after Cross got hurt. Kight, an undrafted rookie, injured his knee during the game, Macdonald said.

Christian McCaffrey returned from leg injuries with a vengeance this season.

A calf injury in August 2024 that was supposed to keep the running back out ""a couple weeks"" turned into him missing the first eight games of the season. He then sustained a knee injury after just four games and sat out the remainder of the year.

But this season, he was his usual self, and it has resulted in quite the recognition from the media.

With his performance after last year's disappointment, McCaffrey is obviously in the running — and probably the favorite — to be the league’s Comeback Player of the Year. But that’s not all.

McCaffrey is the only non-quarterback to be an MVP finalist, and he is also in the running for his second Offensive Player of the Year Award in three years after putting up 2,126 scrimmage yards and scoring 17 total touchdowns.

Only Adrian Peterson in 2012 and Joe Burrow last year have been finalists for all three awards in one season (Drew Brees finished second for all in 2006, but finalists were not named then). Peterson was named the MVP and OPOY while finishing second in Comeback Player of the Year, while Burrow was the Comeback Player of the Year for the second time in his career, which he joked isn't exactly ideal.

McCaffrey finished 76 yards shy of his second 1,000-1,000 season, but he joined the fraternity in 2019 along with Roger Craig and Marshall Faulk. He did, however, have by far the most receptions of any running back with 102 — Bijan Robinson was second with 79.

Earlier this season, McCaffrey was named a first-team All-Pro for the third time in his career. McCaffrey is one of eight players with three or more 2,000-yard scrimmage seasons. Faulk, Eric Dickerson and Walter Payton each had four.

As an aside, McCaffrey is also a finalist for the NFL's Salute to Service Award, presented by USAA, which ""[uses] the power of football to connect with, empower, appreciate and uplift our service members, veterans and their families.""

The quarterback may need a procedure on his right foot, general manager and president of football operations Brandon Beane said Wednesday.

“He could have to have something done to his foot, potentially here soon,"" Beane said. ""But it would not impact OTA stuff if he does.""

Foot issue lingered for weeks

Allen’s right foot injury dates back to Buffalo’s Week 16 win over the Cleveland Browns. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported that Allen aggravated an ""old bone issue on the side of his foot.""

Allen was injured on a 22-yard sack late in the second quarter while retreating in the pocket, falling awkwardly to the turf. He walked to the sideline and was evaluated by athletic trainers before walking to the locker room just prior to halftime with his right cleat off. X-rays taken at halftime were negative, and Allen returned for the second half.

The soreness persisted. Allen underwent additional X-rays on his right foot following a Week 17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. In Week 18, he played just one snap to extend his consecutive starts streak as the Bills rested multiple starters.

Allen played through multiple injuries in playoffs

Allen appeared on the injury report ahead of the AFC divisional round against the Denver Broncos with foot, knee and finger ailments, but was a full participant in practice during the final two sessions of the week.

In the wild-card round the week prior, Allen made two trips to the blue medical tent — once for a concussion evaluation and once to have his knee checked — without missing any snaps.

Busy offseason ahead

If Allen elects to have a procedure, Beane did not provide a timeline. Organized team activities are typically in late May and early June.","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/22/PROC/88297393007-getty-images-2255756495.jpg?crop=5643,3176,x3,y86&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-22 19:39:11.161806

Outside linebacker Harold Landry III and inside linebacker Marte Mapu also remained sidelined as the AFC Championship Game closes in.

Bradbury, who saw every down in the wild card as well as the divisional round, held ironman status until the final two games of the regular season. As for the absences across the ball in Foxborough, both linebackers have missed back-to-back practices leading up to the visit to Mile High. A lingering knee issue has kept Landry on the injury report since late in the fall. New England’s sack leader went from questionable to active last weekend before playing just 11 out of 75 defensive snaps off the edges. A hip issue, meanwhile, has kept Mapu off the field during Broncos prep after logging 58 percent of the workload on special teams in the sendoff at Gillette Stadium.

The Patriots opened Hollins’ activation window on Thursday. The veteran wide receiver, who landed on injured reserve in December because of an abdomen injury, missed four starts before joining the limited in a red non-contact jersey. His return made it six partial participants for the AFC East champions. Count Davis among the others. The starting cornerback has been available for consecutive practices after entering the NFL’s concussion protocol in the final minutes of the divisional round. Two interceptions, two pass breakups and four tackles, including one for loss, were tallied before No. 7 headed to the locker room.

New England’s full participants on Wednesday went unchanged on Thursday. Two of whom recently had their 21-day practice windows open. On injured reserve since sustaining a concussion on the first night of December, Jennings awaits a potential return to the active running back room. And at defensive tackle, the rookie Farmer missed four games with a hamstring injury. Like Hollins, both are eligible to return to a 53-man roster that currently stands at capacity.

ED Byron Young (knee), however, was the other injury, and his potential loss looms very large.
More Seahawks on SI stories Seahawks get bad injury news ahead of NFC Championship Sam Darnold one of NFL’s biggest winners from divisional round What separates the Seahawks from Rams, Broncos & Patriots","The Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams both released initial injury reports on Wednesday afternoon, although the Rams did not actually practice and put out an estimation of their report. Despite being the significantly-better rested team in recent weeks, with much less travel and a bye, the Seahawks report was much longer, although that’s not the only consideration.

Once you dig through the actual information in the report, things clear up fast. Demarcus Lawrence, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and Leonard Williams were all listed as limited for rest, as none of them have any actual injury designation, so nothing to worry about there.

Elijah Arroyo (knee) and Chazz Surratt (ankle) were both listed as full participants, and seem to be quite healthy. Questions remain over whether those two players will be activated this week, but it pretty clearly has more to do with whether the team has any need for them or room for them on the roster rather than their health.

A notable listing here is George Holani (hamstring), who has been on injured reserve for a couple months but practiced in full today, with indications that he’s been physically ready for some time now and should be ready for this weekend. Tyrice Knight (shoulder) was a full participant as well, marking him as available as a backup linebacker this weekend.

The pool of limited players was also relatively comforting. Sam Darnold (oblique) is among them, which was pretty obviously going to be the case after the way Coach Macdonald spoke about him earlier this week, but it’s fairly clear that it’s just a matter of limiting his practice reps to make sure he’s got everything he needs to have success on Sunday. No issues here.

Uchenna Nwosu (hamstring), Robbie Ouzts (neck), and Bryce Cabeldue (knee) also missed some of practice, but got enough in to indicate they will be fine. Ouzts missed a good chunk of the 49ers game with the injury so it makes sense to ease him back in. Cabeldue is interesting since he wasn’t even active on Saturday.

The problem kicks in when you see the three players that didn’t participate today. Normally, only three players missing practice on Wednesday is a good thing, but in this case, all three players play the same position. Charles Cross (foot), Josh Jones (knee, ankle), and Amari Kight (knee) all sat out today, leaving the Seahawks with very little at left tackle.

The good news is that Cross participated in the walkthrough this morning, and Macdonald already said that Cross might play on Sunday without actually practicing during the week. I’m less optimistic about Jones, who seems to be breaking down physically after gutting out the week eighteen game against the 49ers. Kight played well last week but remains inexperienced.

If all three players are unavailable for the Seahawks this weekend, it becomes a scramble drill to field a left tackle. Grey Zabel could be bumped outside, Mason Richman and Bryce Cabeldue could get the call for their first NFL starts, and Logan Brown might get attention as a practice squader the team seems to like. None of this feels particularly good.

There’s no point in panicking on a Wednesday, however, and we’ll need to see how things progress over the next couple days before we assume the worst. Wednesday practices are often the day to play things extra-cautious and understand that players don’t need every single rep to play well on game day.

The Rams have a lot less to be concerned about, although again, they didn’t actually practice. ED Josaiah Stewart (knee) was listed as a full participant, and CB Emmanuel Forbes (shoulder) got hit with a limited designation. Forbes got injured and was forced to leave the game in Chicago last week, and with the Rams thin at corner his situation is worth monitoring.

Only two players were listed with the DNP tag, and one of them is S Quentin Lake (illness), and the odds of an illness of any kind keeping a player out of a conference championship game is almost zero. Particularly in that the illness seems to have been caught so early in the week. ED Byron Young (knee), however, was the other injury, and his potential loss looms very large.

We’ll see what the teams pass along tomorrow before we make any broad assumptions, but the early indications are that this will be a game without an excessive number of injuries, although for the Seahawks, where those injuries are might be very impactful.

How about some speed?,Matt Barrows,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6990139/2026/01/22/brandon-aiyuk-49ers-wide-receiver-needs/,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. — The San Francisco 49ers need speed at wide receiver.
“We were noticeably slower this year than we have been in years past,” Shanahan said at the team’s end-of-season news conference.
Sorry.” Shanahan said Aiyuk stopped fielding phone calls, including a number of attempts from Shanahan.
No 49ers wideout or running back cracked 20 mph, with Robinson coming the closest at 19.66 mph in Week 13.
Jennings’ 643 receiving yards led the 49ers’ wideouts, but it was the most modest team high for a Shanahan-coached wide receiver since Kendrick Bourne had 487 yards in 2018.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. — The San Francisco 49ers need speed at wide receiver.

Coach Kyle Shanahan acknowledged Wednesday that it was missing from his passing attack in 2025, a season in which the team’s top deep threat, Brandon Aiyuk, went AWOL and the next-best option, Ricky Pearsall, dealt with a knee injury from Week 4 onward.

“We were noticeably slower this year than we have been in years past,” Shanahan said at the team’s end-of-season news conference. “Sometimes that’s substituted for a better football player. That doesn’t mean you’re always worse because of that. But you definitely need more speed out there to handle things week in and week out for some of the situations that come up versus certain schemes and certain defenses.”

Neither Shanahan nor general manager John Lynch minced words about Aiyuk, whom the 49ers placed on the reserve/left squad list last month after he stopped going into the team facility to rehabilitate his 2024 ACL injury. Lynch said a roster move was forthcoming, adding, “I think it’s safe to say that he has played his last snap with the Niners.”

Asked if he could shed more light on how the relationship with the receiver, who had just signed a four-year, $120 million extension a year earlier, became so estranged, Lynch said, “I wish I knew. I can’t help you there. Sorry.”

Shanahan said Aiyuk stopped fielding phone calls, including a number of attempts from Shanahan.

“It’s something I’ve never seen in 22 years of coaching,” he said. “So it’s unfortunate, and it’s confusing.”

His departure will leave the 49ers with six receivers signed for the upcoming season: Pearsall, Demarcus Robinson, Jacob Cowing, Jordan Watkins, Malik Turner and Junior Bergen. It also gives the Niners some extra cash after they voided Aiyuk’s future guarantees.

The 49ers might use some of those savings on Jauan Jennings, who led the team with nine receiving touchdowns in 2025 and is scheduled for free agency. The two sides failed to hash out a long-term deal in the summer, with Jennings instead agreeing to a reworked one-year deal. Still, Lynch said the team would try to rekindle those discussions this offseason.

“He dealt with a lot of injuries throughout the course of the year, but Jauan always plays with a passion,” Lynch said. “We can always count on Jauan. We can move him around. He blocks, he does the little things. You can see by the way the other players respond that he plays the right way, and I think it frustrates other people. He makes us better. We’d love to have him back. We’ll go to work to try to get that accomplished, and we’ll see where that goes.”

While Jennings’ return would bolster the 2026 receiving unit, he wouldn’t solve San Francisco’s speed issue. According to Next Gen Stats, the 49ers’ fastest ball carrier in 2025 was a linebacker, Dee Winters, who reached 20.15 mph on his pick six in Indianapolis in Week 16. No 49ers wideout or running back cracked 20 mph, with Robinson coming the closest at 19.66 mph in Week 13.

Jennings’ 643 receiving yards led the 49ers’ wideouts, but it was the most modest team high for a Shanahan-coached wide receiver since Kendrick Bourne had 487 yards in 2018.

The 49ers have speed on the roster. Cowing and Watkins both ran sub-4.4-second 40-yard dashes before their respective drafts, and Pearsall clocked 4.41 seconds before his. But none could stay on the field in 2025. Cowing suffered a hamstring strain in the opening practice of training camp, then aggravated the injury multiple times while rehabilitating. He said he finally got on top of it by the end of the season and is entering the offseason healthy.

Watkins, a rookie, was off to a good start before suffering a high-ankle sprain in the preseason opener.

“If there were a couple more injuries for these receivers in the last month or so, then Jordan would’ve been up,” Shanahan said. “It wasn’t that he wasn’t capable — it’s that he missed his window to pass some people (on the depth chart).”

Then there’s Pearsall. He was averaging nearly 17 yards per catch before his PCL injury against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 4. He returned in Week 11 but aggravated the knee in Week 17.

Asked if Pearsall can better prepare himself to withstand injuries, Shanahan said he thought the receiver did that last offseason when he added weight and was one of the most physically fit players on the roster.

“I think he was leading the league in a lot of categories before he got hurt,” Shanahan said. “And then he landed on his knee in the wrong way. And when you land on your knee the wrong way, and you hurt your PCL, sometimes that can last a week, like (Los Angeles Rams receiver) Puka (Nacua) last year. Sometimes it can last seven weeks.”

“So, can he prepare to not land on his knee? No.”

Odds and ends

• Shanahan called assistant head coach Gus Bradley the top internal candidate to replace Robert Saleh at defensive coordinator.

“I wouldn’t say it’s a real wide net,” he said of the team’s upcoming search. “But I mean, Gus is the obvious one to everyone, and it is to us, too. Gus would be the main internal candidate.”

Bradley is a mentor of Saleh, the new Tennessee Titans head coach. He’s a three-time NFL defensive coordinator who was head coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars from 2013 to 2016.

• Lynch said rookie defensive tackle Alfred Collins might have to have a procedure on his shoulder in the coming weeks. Tight end Jake Tonges, meanwhile, has a plantar fascia issue with his foot but won’t need surgery. Linebacker Nick Martin, who suffered a concussion on Nov. 30, has been making steady progress recently, Lynch said, but is not quite out of the league’s concussion protocol.

• Lynch said defensive ends Nick Bosa and Mykel Williams, who suffered ACL tears in 2025, could be back around the time training camp opens. He wouldn’t put a firm timeline on any of their injured players, including George Kittle (Achilles), but all appear to at least have a chance of being ready before Week 1. Lynch said Bosa was “tracking really well.”

• Tailback Jordan James got his first carries Saturday in Seattle, and Shanahan said the rookie finished the season with a flourish.

“He was ready to go here these last six weeks of the year, big time,” the coach said. “There wasn’t an opportunity for him. But if he has an offseason that we think he’s capable of and can improve, especially the way he looked here at the end of the year, I feel very excited about him helping us.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/21202059/USATSI_24425872-scaled-e1763774655766.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-22 23:39:24.425061

In theNFL playoffsfor the 2025 season, Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix took down the Chicago Bears to advance to the AFC Championship Game. In the process, Nix sustained a season-ending injury in overtime. Enter: Jarrett Stidham.

The Broncos backup is expected to start in the conference championship game. The occasion will mark not only his first start of the season, but only the fifth start of his career.

Stidham will be the second quarterback in history to make his first start of the season in the conference championship game or later, joining Dallas Cowboys' Roger Staubach, who made his first start of the season in the 1972 NFC Championship.

Stidham was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fourth round in 2019 (133rd overall). The Broncos are his third team (Patriots andRaiders). He is 1-3 in four career starts, with eight touchdowns and eight interceptions.

Stidham has played four snaps this season and hasn't thrown a pass since Jan. 7, 2024 (Week 18 of the 2023 season). He'll be just the second QB since 1950 to start a playoff game without a single passing yard on the season, joining Joe Webb, who started a 2012 wild-card game for the Minnesota Vikings.

Check out other quarterbacks who made their first start of the season in the playoffs below:

Taylor Heinicke, Washington Football Team (2020 wild card vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers, L, 31-23)

Four Seahawks, two players and two coaches were named finalists for Associated Press awards for the 2025 NFL season. Head coach Mike Macdonald is up for Coach of the Year, offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak is a finalist for Assistant Coach of the Year, rookie safety Nick Emmanwori is a finalist for Defensive Rookie of the Year and receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba is up for Offensive Player of the Year.

Macdonald helped lead the Seahawks to another winning season, going 14-3 in his second season and claimed the NFC West title as well as the NFC's No. 1 seed. In his second season, Seattle allowed the fewest points in the NFL (17.2 per game) and were the No. 1 team in the league overall, as well as the No. 1 defense according DVOA, Seattle also posted a +191 point differential for the regular season, good for first in the NFL and a franchise record. The Seahawks also set a single-season franchise record with 14 wins and set the single-season franchise record for road wins (8). Macdonald ranks second place in NFL history for the most road wins by a head coach in his first two seasons with 15. Seattle was 7-1 last year and 8-1 this season on the road.

Along with leading the NFL in receiving yards, Smith-Njigba became the first player in NFL history with at least 75 receiving yards in each of his first 11 games of a season. He also had nine 100-yard games this season, the most in the NFL, and the most in a single season in franchise history. Along with that, Smith-Njigba set multiple franchise records and did enough to put his name next to NFL greats in the league record books.

Other candidates for Offensive Player of the Year are Patriots quarterback Drake Maye, 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey, Rams receiver Puka Nacua and Falcons running back Bijan Robinson.

Emmanwori, who was injured on the first drive of the season-opener, missed three games, dealing with an ankle injury. But when he returned, it looked like he hadn't missed any time at all. During the regular season, he started 11 of the 14 games he played in and had 81 tackles, nine tackles for loss, 11 passes defensed, 2.5 sacks, four quarterback hits and an interception. Emmanwori was the only player in the league this season with at least 80 tackles, 10 passes defensed and eight tackles for loss.

The other finalists for Defensive Rookie of the Year are Giants outside linebacker Abdul Carter, Flacons defensive end James Pearce Jr., Browns linebacker Carson Schwesinger and Falcons safety Xavier Watts.
