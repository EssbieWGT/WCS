The Chiefs’ Thursday practice reports showed offensive linemen Wanya Morris (knee) and Jawaan Taylor (triceps/knee) did not practice, while linebacker Nick Bolton was held out with an illness.

Hollywood Brown returned from a personal day, and Trent McDuffie continued limited work.

The challenge is the timing, as the Los Angeles Chargers (9-4) come into Arrowhead on Sunday and the Chiefs (6-7) have virtually no room left to slip if they want to stay in the playoff hunt.

Morris’ knee injury, sustained in Sunday’s loss to the Houston Texans, has been characterized by multiple outlets as season-ending, removing a rotational lineman who had been pressed into starting work this month.

Taylor, a regular starter on the right side, is dealing with a triceps strain and lingering knee trouble; he missed last Sunday and was again listed as DNP on Thursday, leaving his status for Sunday’s matchup uncertain.

The Chiefs have shuffled their tackle spots all season, and QB Patrick Mahomes has taken 29 sacks — 17th-most in the NFL.

Offensively, Mahomes has thrown for 3,398 passing yards and 22 touchdown passes with a QBR of 69.4, along with 407 rushing yards and four rushing TDs, giving the offense an added dimension.

But the Texans game highlighted how protection issues can snowball into turnovers and stalled drives; Mahomes struggled in the loss (160 yards, three interceptions, no touchdowns), and the ongoing attrition up front only raises the risk of more breakdowns.

With four games remaining (Chargers, Titans, Broncos, Raiders), every week now carries added weight.

""We've been taking the right steps to get back on the field,"" Buckner said.","Colts defensive tackle DeForest Buckner was a limited participant again in practice Thursday, after being limited on Wednesday – which was his first practice since being placed on injured reserve with a neck injury prior to Week 10.

Buckner sustained the injury late in the first half of the Colts' Week 9 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He figured he sustained a stinger, and he returned to the game in the second half.

But by the Wednesday after that game, he had lost all strength in the left side of his upper body. Buckner – one of the strongest players on the Colts – couldn't even do a push-up. A scan was done, and it turned out Buckner had a herniated disc in his neck that was pressing on a nerve.

Buckner knew he'd be out for at least four games, but he also didn't know if he'd need surgery to alleviate the issues he was having. The hope was, with treatment and rehab, his strength would return and he'd be able to avoid surgery.

Buckner flew to Panama to get stem cell injections in his neck – he saw the same doctors, who were recommended to him by a few ex-teammates with the San Francisco 49ers, last year when he was placed on injured reserve with a back injury. And then he began a grueling, lonely rehab process, spending hours at the Indiana Farm Bureau Football Center getting treatment while staying sharp working with his personal coach at Ozwell Fitness in Carmel.

And, eventually, Buckner began feeling better.

""It was definitely challenging day by day, especially early on when I didn't know if I was gonna get my strength back or not,"" Buckner said. ""And it was a process, but I got to a spot where I was consistently getting strength, and obviously that was encouraging and brought a lot more confidence.""

One thing Buckner did make sure of, though, was that he was on the plane with the Colts for road games against the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars. He was on the sidelines for those games, as well as the Colts' Week 13 home game against the Houston Texans, lending a voice when he could. Buckner also would pop into meetings during the week after he was done with treatment to try to help where he could.

""Trying to be a player coach as much as possible, and slash cheerleader,"" Buckner said. ""It's definitely challenging. Being on IR, it can definitely be lonely, frustrating, because you're kind of not part of the team but you are part of the team.""

Buckner still needs to be activated off injured reserve to play, as the Colts opened his 21-day window to begin practicing on Wednesday.

""We've been taking the right steps to get back on the field,"" Buckner said. ""And you guys know how I am, I'm doing whatever I can to be out there on the field. Now that we opened my practice window, just seeing how we go moving forward.""

Just because Buckner can be activated from injured reserve for Week 15 does not mean he's guaranteed to play Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks at Lumen Field. Buckner can be activated off injured reserve any time in the next three weeks, and while he's pushing to get back on the field as soon as possible, on Thursday he remained unsure of when that'll exactly be.

""We're just taking it day by day, seeing how it goes,"" Buckner said. ""Getting acclimated back out there and everything and seeing how my neck responds to consistently getting more volume.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/k5sdap9qzpjw8iqsyajx,N,,2025-12-12 00:00:47.594128

Wide receiver has already been a popular position atop many New Orleans Saints mock drafts. Even here at LouisianaSports.Net, wideouts from Arizona State, Jordyn Tyson and Indiana, Elijah Sarratt, have found their way into the first or second round in draft exercises.

Unfortunately, the pool of top wideouts has now taken a big hit with one prospect familiar with Saints’ rookie quarterback Tyler Shough having suffered a major knee injury.

Per ESPN’s Adam Schefter and Pete Thamel, Louisville wide receiver and Shough’s former teammate Chris Bell suffered a torn ACL.

The two appeared in 12 games together last year, combining for 37 receptions, 677 receiving yards and two touchdown connections. Bell added six receptions for 60 yards to his season total in the team’s bowl game against the Washington Huskies.

Bell produced well in his 11 games in 2025, reeling in 72 receptions for 916 receiving yards and six touchdown catches.

A “clean” ACL tear is typically seen as a more favorable injury than a rupture or incomplete tear. But surgery and recovery time are still substantial. This could potentially keep Bell out for around half of the season in 2026 and is sure to impact his draft stock.

The Saints should absolutely be interested in this year’s talented class of wideouts in the next NFL Draft. But Bell’s name will now carry an injury tag that may make it challenging to consider reuniting Shough with his top option from 2024.",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/3859/files/2025/12/2025-10-18t025641z-1724488589-mt1usatoday27349804-rtrmadp-3-ncaa-football-louisville-at-miami.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 00:00:52.301585

Here's a look at the top news from the Cowboys, Vikings and the NFL as a whole.","The Dallas Cowboys returned to the practice field for the first time since their Thursday Night loss to Detroit. The mini-bye week was supposed to cure most of the teams bumps and bruises but a few injuries continue to linger for this team.

Cornerback Trevon Diggs was among the walking wounded and although he is apparently healthy enough to play, there's a huge question about whether he'll play this week, or any week remaining in the season. Left tackle Tyler Guyton and safety Malik Hooker missed practice, but wideout CeeDee Lamb (concussion) was among several players who hit the field despite injury concerns.

Minnesota, the Cowboys' upcoming opponent, is managing injures of their own as two major players on offense missed practice and 12 others participated in limited fashion mainly for rest. One of those limited players is receiver Jordan Addison who continues to manage the achilles he ruptured that ended his season last year. The Vikings also added linebacker Josh Ross to their roster to help with the final stretch of the season.

Phillip Rivers, 44, suited up for Indianapolis to try and help their fading playoff chances, and seems poised to see his first game action in five seasons. In other league news, the NFL has shortened the time allotment for teams to make their first-round draft picks, hopefully getting folks to bed at a reasonable hour. The league has also backed a new flag football venture. Here's a look at the top news from the Cowboys, Vikings and the NFL as a whole.

Lamb sustained a concussion in the third quarter of the Cowboys' Dec. 4 loss to the Detroit Lions when his head hit the ground after he leaped to make a catch.

Speaking after Thursday's practice, Lamb said he does not have any apprehension in his return.

""Nah, in a situation like that, bro, as far as getting hurt or getting a concussion, it's not like you're thinking about, 'Oh, what if? What if I get hurt again?'"" Lamb said. ""I feel like if you live in that realm and you feed that fuel it's going to happen. And you don't want to live in a realm like that it's never going to happen again. Really, it's [about] staying level, just being positive about each and every opportunity you get and just staying blessed.""

Lamb sustained a concussion in 2021 and missed one game.

The 10-day break between the Lions and Vikings games was advantageous to the star wideout, who said he has not had any symptoms as he has worked through the protocol. He went through a limited part of Wednesday's practice.

Lamb said he saw a replay of the play on which he was concussed.

""It was all over my phone. I couldn't miss it,"" he said. ""I will say: I remember everything. I wasn't -- I don't know, I can't say I wasn't knocked out because clearly I was -- but I remember everything.""

Lamb recently switched helmets and wears a Guardian Cap during practices, but he said he will not wear one in games.

""It's not comfortable,"" he said.

Lamb also defended fellow Cowboys receiver George Pickens, who was criticized for his effort by Amazon Prime analyst Richard Sherman after catching five passes for 37 yards in the loss to the Lions.

""I just feel like they were waiting on him to have a bad game,"" Lamb said. ""It was quiet all season and he was averaging 100 [yards], 110, doing crazy things, but the one opportunity that he get, he didn't step up to their appreciation. And I feel like for us to come out victorious it wasn't just all on him. Once one of us go out, D-coordinators are very smart. It's not like I go out and they stay playing the same coverage. I mean they're going to lean coverage to him. They're going to cheat. They're going to do different things. People are smart. People understand football. I don't know why it's like that, I don't know, people just act like it's just night and day. They got jobs too over there. Them people don't want to get fired and they know if they let G spin by himself somebody's getting fired.""

Pickens has not addressed the media yet this week, but quarterback Dak Prescott said the receiver has been ""amazing.""

""He's responded great. Just came in like a pro, as I expected him to do,"" Prescott said.

""When you're playing to the level he is and to the standard or anybody's expectations when you play the way that he does ... he owns that. He's had a hell of a week of practice, and he's going to continue to finish that way. There's no doubt all that is going to just transpire into the game.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1205%2Fr1585169_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 00:01:00.218569

Knowing about injuries to key players is an essential piece for NFL fans and fantasy managers at this time, too. They will want to know who might be out or limited in upcoming games. Here’s a breakdown of notable injuries and what you need to know.

De’Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins

Dolphins running back De’Von Achane suffered a rib injury when he fell on the football during Sunday’s victory over the New York Jets. An MRI was done on Achane’s injured ribs, and it didn’t indicate that he’d suffered a fracture.

While no official word on Achane’s condition was released on Tuesday, Achane may sit out a few of this week’s practices ahead of Miami’s game on Monday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

If Achane is unavailable for the Monday night game, look for Jaylen Wright to get a few more touches.

Lamb suffered a concussion in Dallas’ loss to the Detroit Lions. No update on Lamb’s condition was available on Tuesday.

Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones, though, did offer an update on Monday. “He’s doing a good job,” Jones said. “He’s meeting all the thresholds that you need to meet that will get him to where he can play this week. So far, he’s had no setbacks.”

Benson has been dealing with a meniscus injury. Benson has not played since Week 4. He will have to be activated this week or will miss the rest of the 2025 season.

On Tuesday, Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon offered an update on Benson’s situation in an interview with a Phoenix sports radio station.

“I know he’s doing everything he can to get back out there,” Gannon said. “You know, we opened his window a little bit ago. The return to play, like all return to plays, is not linear. Every guy’s a little bit different. But he’s working at it, and we’re, we got a good plan for him and hopefully can get back out there.”

Alvin Kamara, RB, New Orleans Saints

Update 12/10: Saints running back Alvin Kamara did not practice with the team.

Kamara has missed the last two games with knee and ankle injuries. No update was given on Tuesday regarding Kamara’s status.

On Monday, however, Saints head coach Kellen Moore said, “We’ll see” regarding a return this coming Sunday and considered him “questionable.” The Saints will release their first injury report on Wednesday, at which time further details about Kamara will be available.

Let’s start with my concerns about New England: The Patriots run defense has been slipping in recent weeks.
Before Milton Williams’s injury, New England had a top five run defense in rushing success rate allowed (Weeks 1-10).
Verdict: Bet Bills moneyline (–115) Green Bay Packers (–2.5) at Denver Broncos The Broncos and Packers enter Week 15 with two of the league’s three best defenses when it comes to preventing explosive plays.
Aaron Rodgers had one of his best games of the season last week and completed four passes of 20 yards or more.","When you bet on sports long enough, most of your gambling stories end up blending together and fading from memory. It takes a true outlier event, a stunningly bad beat or a historically improbable win, for a betting memory to become a “where were you” moment. And while most normal sports fans will forget about Daniel Carlson’s 46-yard field goal as time expired in the Raiders’ 24-17 loss to the Broncos last Sunday, I will remember and cherish that kick forever.

It was one of the most improbable betting wins of my life. I called Cousin Sal in excitement to talk about how we had just pulled off an incredible gambling heist. I’ll probably never understand why Pete Carroll chose to kick that field goal. Or why Broncos safety Brandon Jones lay on top of Raiders receiver Tyler Lockett when time was about to expire. All I know is that the Raiders lost by fewer than 7.5 points. He might not be in the job for much longer, but Sunday was the moment that Carroll truly became Las Vegas’s football coach.

Now that we’re onto Week 15, bye weeks are over. This is the final normal scheduling week of the NFL regular season. That means 16 games, a loaded Sunday slate, and, unfortunately, some very one-sided matchups on paper.

Here are my thoughts on the entire Week 15 slate, including my favorite five bets. (All lines are from FanDuel as of Thursday morning.)

The Favorite Five

I’ll be highlighting my favorite five picks each week throughout the season, which will serve as a preview for my picks on The Ringer 107—a season-long contest between The Bill Simmons Podcast, The Ringer NFL Show, The Ringer Gambling Show, and The Ringer Fantasy Football Show. I’ll be partnering with Cousin Sal to make the Gambling Show’s Friday picks. Through 14 weeks, this column is 52-54-1 overall and 33-37 on the Favorite Five.

Buffalo Bills (–1.5) at New England Patriots

Like the Broncos, the Patriots are another team with an excellent record, and the betting market continues to be skeptical about this team. It’s highly unusual that the Broncos and Pats, the top two seeds in the current AFC playoff picture, both of which have multiple game leads over everyone else in the conference, would be home underdogs in the same week. Even though the Patriots dismantled the shoddy Giants defense with a superb Drake Maye performance the last time we saw them play, I think that it’s time for Buffalo to get its revenge for their first meeting earlier this season.

Let’s start with my concerns about New England: The Patriots run defense has been slipping in recent weeks. Before Milton Williams’s injury, New England had a top five run defense in rushing success rate allowed (Weeks 1-10). Since Williams left the Jets game with an injury in Week 11, the Patriots have slipped to 28th. The post-injury sample is admittedly only three games, but there have been real cracks in the foundation that Buffalo will be looking to exploit through James Cook and the power run game.

The Patriots have also struggled in the red zone, and that’s an area where Buffalo has a definite advantage because of its ability to unleash Josh Allen as a runner. The Patriots rank 24th in red zone touchdown percentage, while Buffalo sits at ninth. Against the Bengals in Week 12, the Patriots’ red zone issues nearly cost them late in the game, and it could happen again in another high-leverage close game. Their struggles stem from their inability to consistently run the ball.

Verdict: Bet Bills moneyline (–115)

Green Bay Packers (–2.5) at Denver Broncos

The Broncos and Packers enter Week 15 with two of the league’s three best defenses when it comes to preventing explosive plays. Both defenses excel at tackling underneath and have such dominant pass rushes that it’s difficult to consistently push the ball down the field or generate yards after the catch against them. Sunday will be a battle of which offense is able to be more methodical about moving the ball down the field with consistent first downs. Green Bay has had a few puzzling offensive performances this year, but the Packers are more reliable in series conversion rate—a metric that examines how often an offense moves the chains. The Packers rank fifth, while the Broncos sit at 19th.

The Broncos defense plays a lot of man coverage, and Jordan Love has been the league’s most efficient quarterback against that type of coverage. Love tries to push the ball downfield as much as any quarterback in the NFL, too, but Denver won’t make that as easy as Chicago did last week.

Despite Denver’s impressive 11-2 record, the betting markets still don’t believe that it is a truly elite team. The Broncos are the 11th-best team based on betting market odds, which is why they are a home underdog to Green Bay (third) by nearly a field goal.

Verdict: Bet under 43.5 (–110)

Cleveland Browns at Chicago Bears (–7.5)

If you’re the kind of person who believes in trap games, there’s no better example of a bad situational spot for a team than the Bears’ home game against Cleveland on Sunday. The lowly Browns come to Chicago and catch the Bears in the middle of their Green Bay twofer. One week after a heartbreaking last-minute loss, Chicago surely has one eye on the rematch with its rival at Soldier Field next week, which could very well decide the NFC North title.

The Bears should win this game. But this is still the first time all season that they have been favored by more than a touchdown. Chicago has vastly improved from Week 1 to now, but it is not without flaws. The passing game is not consistent. The pass rush ranks 28th in pressure rate. The Bears have been the late-game darlings of the NFL this year, but winning by margin doesn’t come easily to them.

The Browns defense might not be as dominant away from home, but this remains a good matchup for their run defense, which can slow Chicago down and keep the game within a score. Chicago does have the fifth-highest rush rate, and the steady improvement and recent explosion of their run game has been the primary driver of their 9-4 record. But Cleveland ranks first in the NFL in rushing success rate allowed.

Verdict: Bet Browns +7.5 (–110)

Las Vegas Raiders at Philadelphia Eagles (–11.5)

A wise man would not be dying to jump back in to bet on the Raiders after their absolute miracle cover on Sunday. A wise man would take the money he made last week and run. But I am not a wise man. And I am not sure that this price can be justified given the current state of the Eagles offense. The Eagles have played 13 football games this season, and they have been above average in EPA per drive in only three of them. Their offense cannot consistently move the ball and is heavily reliant on explosive plays to be successful.

The Raiders defense is not good, but it is sixth best at preventing big plays. Defensive coordinator Patrick Graham likes to sit in zone defense and keep his safeties high. Last year, the Eagles would have been able to run the ball effectively and force Graham to change his looks. They have not shown that they can do that this season.

If you can stomach a bet on the Raiders and Kenny Pickett, I’d consider the under instead, but the Eagles need to prove that they can win by margin first. They’ve won one game all season by multiple scores.

Verdict: Bet Raiders +11.5 (–110)

Los Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (–5.5)

The Chargers pulled out the win against the Eagles in dramatic fashion on Monday night, but it’s hard to feel good about how their offense looked after a clearly hampered Justin Herbert finished 12-of-26, with just 5.3 yards per attempt. Herbert’s accuracy seemed limited by his left hand injury, and while he scrambled for 66 yards to keep the offense afloat, the constant pressure on him will likely continue to affect his performance. Herbert was pressured on 63.4 percent of his dropbacks on Monday night, and he had multiple turnovers. Now, he’ll face a defense that will bring pressure as much as possible. A healthy Herbert with a nearly full-strength offensive line carved open the Chiefs defense in the first week of the season, but now they’re facing a much different challenge at a raucous Arrowhead Stadium.

It seems like the dam could break for the Chargers offense in this game. They’ve kept afloat in most games—Jacksonville in Week 12 aside—since Joe Alt got injured again. But how long can they keep sustaining the offense with turnstile offensive lineman who are allowing absurd pressure rates?

I hate to sound like a broken record in this column, but the market continues to have immense respect for the quality and pedigree of the Chiefs. The betting markets still rate the Chiefs as the best team in the AFC, even if it is highly unlikely that they’ll make the playoffs now. If you were hoping for a discount to bet Kansas City, the betting markets won’t give you one.

The path to beating the Chargers defense is committing to the run game and methodically moving the ball. I’m not sure that the Chiefs can do the first part without making this game quite slow and low scoring.

Verdict: Bet under 41.5 (–110)

Thursday Night Football

Atlanta Falcons at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (–4.5)

It would be easy to call this a must-win for the Buccaneers, but the reality is that their season will come down to their two matchups against Carolina in Weeks 16 and 18. The Bucs are activating wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan from injured reserve before this game. I suspect that they are trying to ease Evans and McMillan in so that both will be ready for the more important upcoming games.

This Tampa Bay season started with a ton of promise; Baker Mayfield was rescuing a bunch of games in the final moments, but he’s been one of the worst quarterbacks in the entire league since Week 7. Some of that is certainly a result of all the injuries to the skill group and maybe even an injury to Mayfield himself, but we’re at a point where Tampa Bay is extremely vulnerable week to week. I still want to keep fading the Buccaneers until Mayfield shows the league that he can put together a consistent four-quarter performance again.

The Falcons enter this game shorthanded on offense, as wide receiver Drake London is out yet again and tight end Kyle Pitts is questionable. But schematically, this is a great matchup for Bijan Robinson in the receiving game. The Bucs love to bring pressure, but Kirk Cousins has held up well against the blitz, and the Bucs are allowing the most receiving yards in the league to running backs.

Verdict: Bet Falcons +4.5 (–110) and Bijan Robinson over 36.5 receiving yards (–110)

The Rest of the Slate

Indianapolis Colts at Seattle Seahawks (–13.5)

Look, I’m not saying that I want to bet on some combination of Philip Rivers, Riley Leonard, and Brett Rypien at quarterback on Sunday. But it’s really hard to justify the market laying this many points on Seattle. The look-ahead line was Seattle –3.5. Even with the acknowledgment that look-ahead lines don’t have high liquidity and aren’t the best barometer of the real betting market, it’s quite a drastic one-week adjustment for this spread to jump 10 points. That said, the Colts will be without their top corners, as Charvarius Ward and Sauce Gardner are out, and they’ll have to protect their quarterback of choice without right tackle Braden Smith, who is in concussion protocol.

If the Colts do start Rivers, who practiced on Wednesday, it would basically be unprecedented. The only other quarterback who’s returned from a five-year hiatus to play football was Steve DeBerg in 1998. Forty-four-year-old DeBerg rejoined the Atlanta Falcons as the backup quarterback that season and finished 9-of-17, with two turnovers and three sacks, in his lone start. Even if Rivers and head coach Shane Steichen remain close friends who talk football all the time, there has to be some learning curve if you’re walking into an NFL offense during a game week and playing on Sunday. But Rivers might still be the best option if the alternative is a physically compromised Leonard (who has a knee injury).

This is a fascinating football experiment and a compelling human interest story. I might even find myself betting the Colts on the moneyline just in case Rivers does get the start. But much like we saw with the Vikings’ Max Brosmer start against Seattle two weeks ago, there’s a ton of variance in possible outcomes, and it’s worth investing in alternate spreads, depending on whether you think Phil can still sling it.

You also have to wonder whether the Seahawks will have one eye on their critical division clash against the Rams coming up on Thursday.

Verdict: Bet on alternate spreads in either direction, depending on whether you want to hate- or nostalgia-watch Rivers

Arizona Cardinals at Houston Texans (-9.5)

Five weeks ago, the Texans season was on life support; they sat at 3-5 following a loss at home to the Broncos. Houston had just lost starting quarterback C.J. Stroud to a concussion and faced a gauntlet of an upcoming schedule. The underlying metrics always suggested that Houston was better than its record, and as it turns out, everyone—including the betting markets—was underrating the Texans. Houston has won five in a row (and covered the spread in four), beating the Jaguars, Titans, Bills, Colts, and Chiefs to surge into the heart of the AFC South race.

Given the current state of the AFC—both the Chiefs and Ravens are in grave danger of missing the playoffs altogether—how many teams in the conference are definitely better than Houston? The offensive line went from abysmal to passable. The offense is hardly consistent, but running back Woody Marks and wide receiver Nico Collins have just enough explosive spark to put some points on the board consistently. Given that Houston’s defense is the best by EPA per drive of any unit since 2021, the offense doesn’t have to score much for the Texans to be a tough team to beat in the AFC playoffs.

Could this game serve as a bit of a breakout for the Houston offense? It’s one thing to struggle on the road against playoff-caliber defenses, but we have seen that when Stroud faces a defense that doesn’t generate much pressure, the offense becomes highly efficient. Houston moved the ball up and down the field against the very injured Ravens and 49ers defenses and now gets to face another shorthanded unit this Sunday. The Cardinals rank 27th in pressure rate, so Stroud should be kept relatively clean.

I wouldn't be surprised if Houston scores more than anticipated, but I’ll pass here.

Verdict: Pass

Tennessee Titans at San Francisco 49ers (–13.5)

Only the Panthers generate pressure at a lower rate than the San Francisco 49ers. The Niners posted quality defensive showings against Carolina and Cleveland over the past two weeks, but their underlying vulnerability remains. It’s next to impossible for me to lay that many points on a defense that creates so little havoc. Even if the Titans don’t score a lot of points, they should be able to move the ball somewhat consistently in this game, bleed the clock, and stay competitive. One of Cam Ward’s biggest problems has been his sack rate. That concern is somewhat alleviated by a matchup with this San Francisco defense.

Friends usually don’t let friends bet on the Titans, but they can also prevent you from laying nearly two touchdowns on a very flawed defense.

Verdict: Lean Titans +13.5 (–110)

Minnesota Vikings at Dallas Cowboys (-6.5)

The haters wrote J.J. McCarthy off this season. But last week, against the Commanders, he didn’t write back.

McCarthy had by far his best game as a professional quarterback last week and finally made the bettors who’d been blindly fading him pay up. On paper, Minnesota’s skill position players against the Dallas secondary is one of the biggest mismatches of the entire season. The Cowboys run defense may be improved, but their secondary still has serious holes that can be exploited by a capable offense.

On the other side, we’ve seen Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores get the better of plenty of great quarterbacks, but it will be difficult for him to scheme up pressure to rattle Dak Prescott. Prescott, especially at home, is elite at diagnosing defenses pre-snap. He excels against the blitz, has two elite wide receivers (when George Pickens cares), and loves to throw over the middle of the field. Flores's defenses will leave the middle open, and Prescott is sure to throw into the windows vacated by extra rushers. He ranks fourth in success rate against the blitz this season.

This has all the makings of a high-scoring matchup, if McCarthy can exploit a bad secondary.

Verdict: Lean over 47.5 (–110)

New York Jets at Jacksonville Jaguars (–13.5)

There are too many games with real intrigue and consequence in Week 15 for me to dive deep into a December matchup that might be started by Jets rookie QB Brady Cook. After a week of national media gushing about Trevor Lawrence, it would be very fitting if this game were close in the fourth quarter, even if it shouldn’t be.

Verdict: Pass

Carolina Panthers (–2.5) at New Orleans Saints

Tyler Shough had a ton of success in his first meeting with Carolina on the road this season, in part because the Panthers are dead last in pressure rate in the NFL. Shough threw for 282 yards on 27 attempts, and the Saints shut down the Carolina offense en route to a comfortable 17-7 win. Last week, we even saw a different dimension of the Saints rookie quarterback when he added two touchdowns with his legs. This is as friendly of a matchup as you can draw up for Shough, and I think that the Saints will be a very lively home underdog on Sunday as a result. Like the Buccaneers, the Panthers have a more important game coming up next Sunday.

While Carolina does have a rest advantage coming off the bye, it offers a pretty simple matchup for New Orleans to solve right now. If you can effectively stop the run and force Bryce Young into obvious passing downs, you can slow down the Panthers offense. New Orleans ranks 10th in rush success rate allowed, and Young is 41st out of 44 quarterbacks in EPA per dropback in obvious passing situations (third or fourth down and 6-plus yards).

Verdict: Bet Saints ML (+120)

Washington Commanders at New York Giants (–2.5)

Both teams began with varying degrees of promise but have quickly devolved as they've been infected by the injury bug. Jayden Daniels has more notable injuries than wins this season, and this hollowed-out version of the Giants offense without running back Cam Skattebo and wide receiver Malik Nabers is lacking any juice.

There is a case to be made right now that Marcus Mariota is running the Commanders offense better than Daniels was and that their run game should be able to move the ball against the porous Giants run defense. Even when teams have nothing to play for, you would expect the Commanders to respond after their absolute shellacking in Minnesota last week. Teams are 97-68-4 all time against the spread (59 percent) following a loss of 30-plus points, per Action Network.

Verdict: Lean Commanders +2.5, bet at +3

Baltimore Ravens (-2.5) at Cincinnati Bengals

These two teams played on Thanksgiving, and the Ravens closed as a 7.5-point favorite. The Bengals ended up winning comfortably in Baltimore, and both teams lost close coin-flip games last week. The question you have to answer now is whether it makes sense for oddsmakers to downgrade the Ravens by two or three points.

Given the current state of both Lamar Jackson and the Ravens pass rush, I think that the adjustment is correct. The Ravens were completely unable to pressure Aaron Rodgers effectively last week, and the Steelers had five plays of 20-plus yards. In the 12 weeks before that game, the Steelers offense had 30 total.

Until we see a healthier and more mobile version of Jackson, it’ll be hard to bet money on the Ravens. However, there’s a way to target Cincinnati’s awful tight end coverage by betting on the Ravens’ three tight ends—Isaiah Likely, Mark Andrews, and even Charlie Kolar—in the prop markets. Baltimore and Likely will be out to right a wrong after he fumbled while running into the end zone in that crucial Thanksgiving-night first half.

Verdict: Pass the game, but bet Likely to score a touchdown (+260)

Detroit Lions at Los Angeles Rams (–5.5)

The Rams’ slipup against the Panthers on the road two weeks ago was more a product of some poor plays by Matthew Stafford than an indication of true flaws within the roster. Stafford and his offense proved that when they pummeled the Cardinals last week, and the betting market now sees the Rams as the best team in the NFL. The Lions still have a quality run defense that can slow down the emerging one-two punch of running backs Kyren Williams and Blake Corum, but the Lions’ problems in this matchup are in the secondary. We know that Detroit likes to play a lot of man coverage, and the Rams rank third in the NFL in EPA per dropback against man coverage. The Packers and Cowboys are both in the top six in the same metric, and they just combined to score 61 points in two games against Kelvin Sheppard’s defense.

I’m not really sure what the Lions’ path is to get any real stops in this game, unless Stafford throws the ball to the other team a couple of times. I’d be tempted to play the over, assuming the Lions get extremely pass heavy while they’re trailing, but this total is 54.5 for a reason.

If I had to bet this, I’d lay the points with the Rams. But I don’t have to, so it’s just a lean to their side for me.

Verdict: Lean Rams –5.5 (–110)

Miami Dolphins at Pittsburgh Steelers (–3.5)

Mike Tomlin needs only two more victories to secure yet another winning season in Pittsburgh, and this is a prime opportunity for him to move one step closer. Aaron Rodgers had one of his best games of the season last week and completed four passes of 20 yards or more.

The Steelers had an uncharacteristically explosive showing last week, but both of these offenses love to use the short pass underneath to move the football consistently and methodically. Rodgers and Tua Tagovailoa are in the bottom six among QBs this year in average depth of target, yet it’s Pittsburgh whose defense is considerably better at defending against these types of passes.

The Steelers rank 14th in EPA per dropback allowed on passes within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage, while the Dolphins are way down at 28th. If this becomes a dink-and-dunk battle, I may trust the schematic chops of Mike McDaniel more, but I favor the talent and production of the Steelers. At 3.5, I’d lean with Miami, but not enough to bet on it.

Verdict: Lean Dolphins +3.5 (–105)

On top of starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. being out for the season after undergoing knee surgery, the Falcons are just 4-9 at the time of this writing. They have lost seven of their last nine games, with no real end in sight to their on-field woes. But divisional games are different.

Outside linebacker Harold Landry III did not participate in Thursday’s practice. The veteran starter, who leads the team in sacks, tackles for loss and quarterback hits, had been available for the previous session in a limited capacity while managing a knee injury.

Running back Terrell Jennings also remained sidelined for the active roster as the AFC East rematch nears.

Here’s the second injury report heading into Sunday’s 1 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.

Jennings has resided in the NFL’s concussion protocol since the final game before the bye week. The sophomore running back and kickoff returner headed from the blue medical tent to the locker room in the first half against the New York Giants. He was downgraded to out for the rest of what became a 33-15 Monday night win. As for Landry, the March arrival off the edges played a season-low 31 defensive snaps as the calendar flipped to December. Coming out of the break, No. 2 has been spotted during one practice in Foxborough.

Two Patriots practiced in a partial capacity on Thursday. Lowe, fresh off his first start of the year at left tackle, continues to work through an abdomen issue. And across the line of scrimmage, Spillane was added to the injury report because of a foot issue. The off-ball captain at linebacker leads the defense in tackles and ranks third in snaps played. Meanwhile, in Orchard Park, a 46-game starter at cornerback joined the limited. Benford was spotted by reporters in a walking boot following Bills practice. He has intercepted passes in consecutive weeks, returning the latest for a 63-yard touchdown.

Three recent Patriots inactives were listed as full participants for the second practice in a row. A rookie starter at left guard and an All-Pro captain on special teams had been ruled out for Week 13 due to ankle injuries. A chest injury also saw Tonga go from questionable to scratched.

Daniel Jones has a season-ending Achilles injury, Riley Leonard is dealing with a knee injury and Anthony Richardson is on injured reserve with an orbital fracture. So the Colts started calling old friends, desperate for a solution at QB.

One of the QBs that Indy reached out to was Denver Broncos practice squad quarterback Sam Ehlinger, according to a report from the Denver Post's Parker Gabriel. Ehlinger spent the first four years of his career with the Colts, but he turned down an opportunity to reunite with his former team.

“We’re really happy here and enjoy the organization, the path we’re on and what we’re building,"" Ehlinger told Parker. ""I want to be part of that. I was in Indianapolis for four years and I love everybody over there. It’s just a difficult situation, obviously.”

The Broncos are currently the No. 1 playoff seed in the AFC while Indy's fighting to stay in the playoff hunt at 8-5. This marks the second time this season that Ehlinger has turned down a 53-man roster spot elsewhere to remain on Denver's practice squad. He's clearly bought into Sean Payton's program, even in a QB3 role.

The Colts did manage to bring back Philip Rivers, who is coming out of retirement at age 44, and he could start this weekend.

Mike Evans injury update The Buccaneers have not yet announced whether their top wide receiver will be back in action for tonight's game against the Falcons.
An announcement may not come until the team announces its inactive players for ""Thursday Night Football"".","The Tampa Bay Buccaneers dropped to 7-6 following their shocking 24-20 loss to the New Orleans Saints in Week 14.

Buccaneers all-time leading receiver Mike Evans is among the many injured playmakers this season for Tampa Bay. Evans has been out of action since suffering a broken collarbone in the team's loss to the Detroit Lions on ""Monday Night Football"" in Week 7.

The Bucs host the Atlanta Falcons (4-9) on ""Thursday Night Football"" on Thursday, Dec. 11. The question remaining is whether the star wide receiver will make his return.

Evans has been on injured reserve (IR) and had his practice window opened on Dec. 3 ahead of Week 14. He has logged limited practices every day since and the Buccaneers had 21 days to activate him from the time they opened his practice window.

Tampa Bay enters Week 15 with a 7-6 record – in the fourth spot in the NFC playoff picture – leaving little room for error. They are battling to stay atop the NFC South race and Bucs fans are hopeful their All-Pro wide receiver will be available today.

Here's the latest on Evans before the ""Thursday Night Football"" kickoff against the Falcons.

Mike Evans injury update

The Buccaneers have not yet announced whether their top wide receiver will be back in action for tonight's game against the Falcons. He was activated from Injured Reserve on Wednesday, opening the door for a potential return.

In the absence of any official news, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported that Evans is ""good to go"" for the Week 15 ""Thursday Night Football"" game against the Falcons. The veteran wideout will make his return from a broken collarbone after a six-game stint on injured reserve.

The NFC South leaders have been battered by injuries, but they have found ways to win despite the absence of some of their top players.

Evans has missed nine games this season, missing six of those since suffering the broken collarbone and he can now return to action tonight.

Evans practiced in a limited capacity for the second consecutive week and his status for tonight's game is still undetermined. An announcement may not come until the team announces its inactive players for ""Thursday Night Football"".

At the time of Evans' injury, it was reported he could return in December, and he has been on track to do so. The original timeline for return was about two months with no setbacks after Evans underwent surgery to repair the clavicle fracture, which the NFL Network described as a ""clean break.""

The eight-week timeline from the injury would have Evans on track to return for Week 15, when the Buccaneers host the Falcons on ""Thursday Night Football"" on Dec. 11, or in Week 16, when they play on the road against the Panthers on Dec. 21.

The Buccaneers remain in first place in the NFC South entering Week 15 but the Carolina Panthers are right on their heels with an identical record of 7-6. Tampa Bay would certainly stand to benefit if Evans can return during their playoff push during the final weeks of the regular season.

Chris Godwin

Emeka Egbuka

Tez Johnson

Jalen McMillan (activated from IR Wednesday)

Sterling Shepard

Ryan Miller

Kameron Johnson

Jaden Smith (IR – undisclosed)

The Buccaneers' receiving group has dealt with many injuries this season. Rookies Egbuka and Tez Johnson have stepped up while Evans, McMillan and Godwin have been sidelined.

Godwin has played the last three games but has not topped a 70% snap rate in any. Meanwhile, McMillan also had his 21-day practice window opened on Dec. 3 and continues to log limited practices. He was activated from IR alongside Evans. Additionally, Shepard - the 10-year veteran - has provided some consistency and depth.

I'm doing everything, meeting all my requirements, getting ahead of everything, and especially with the extra two to three days that we had off — I feel like that was big.""

As with most NFL athletes, being removed from the field, and particularly when they're on their way to having a career game, isn't something they take kindly to. Lamb was no different, trying to stick around to help the struggling Cowboys' offense avoid the eventual defeat in the Motor City, but he readily admits the neurologist and training staff saved him from himself in that situation.

And as he reflects on it further, the gravity of that moment settles in, and a cooler, wiser head prevails.

""Obviously, when you have to go to the tent, it was very clear you did not want to leave the game,"" he said. ""Is there also a part of you that's glad that those are in place to protect you from yourself and your future in football? Yeah, absolutely. They're doing their job, and obviously, me as a competitor, I want to do mine.

""But it's times where they do have to protect me from me, and that was the situation to where that was one of them. I felt like I was having a pretty good game. I was just kinda getting started — getting to cooking — and for me to really take myself out .. just putting myself out there, and I feel like, just giving my guys my all.

""… I'm happy for the training staff. I'm happy for everybody that's reached out. I'm happy for really just another opportunity of waking up and doing what I love again.""

Lamb made it to the team's charter flight to depart with his teammates, and with no assistance needed, bags or otherwise, then showing up to work out on Monday, and he's since returned to full practice duties — effective Thursday — more great signs that he does have ""only one or two"" more benchmarks to clear, per head coach Brian Schottenheimer, before being released from the league's concussion protocol.

Loving what he's seeing from Lamb after such a terrifying moment is his quarterback and one of his best friends, Dak Prescott, who also offered up words of praise and encouragement.

""Yeah, zero concern [about Lamb now],"" the All-Pro QB said. ""Obviously, on the field, you see a guy, whatever they call that, you know when his hands get into that [locked] formation, right? Whether it's your brother, teammate, or somebody on the other team, you don't want to see that. So, yeah, obviously, there is some urgency to get him help right then.

""But then, actually, when I got over there, he was almost like right back to it. I was like, 'You good?' And he's like, 'Yeah.' … I was positive in the way that he would respond, and he's been great.""

With only a couple days remaining before the Vikings march onto the field at AT&T Stadium, Lamb is on the right track, and a deep exhale is a justified response by all — a close call that turned out to be nothing more than that.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/bstxrtlxwn91jze6ava1,N,,2025-12-11 18:02:31.282611

Linebacker T.J. Watt did not practice on Thursday and team spokesman Burt Lauten released the following statement.

""T.J Watt is currently in a local hospital for further medical evaluation of his lung after experiencing discomfort at the practice facility on Wednesday. He will not be at practice on Thursday, and his status for Monday night's game vs. Miami is in question. Coach Tomlin will provide more updates at the appropriate time.""

There was a myriad of players who didn't work, as Coach Mike Tomlin indicated many would be limited to start the week.

""Certainly, we have several guys in the concussion protocol,"" said Tomlin. We'll let that process run its course and the medical experts will be center stage in determining availability of those guys. Those guys are (Andrus) Peat, Malik Harrison, Darnell Washington.

""We have some other guys who got banged up during the course of play. Keeanu Benton had an ankle. He was able to go back and finish. I'm sure that will limit him some at the early portions of this week. James Pierre suffered a calf injury. He was able to finish but could impact him at the early portions of this week. Ben Skowronek, Yahya Black, and some others.""

One player who could be looked at as the arrow is pointing up is safety Kyle Dugger, after he missed the Ravens game.

""Kyle Dugger has a chance to come back this week from his hand injury, and the rest are bumps and bruises associated with play,"" said Tomlin.

Tomlin shared more information on receiver DK Metcalf, who remained in Baltimore overnight on Sunday for observation.

""He got hit in the abdomen or stomach in-game,"" said Tomlin. ""I think they gave him some basic over-the-counter remedies in-game, like Pepto, and it got probably progressively worse after the game.

""So, appreciative of our medical experts. We just exercised an abundance of caution. We didn't want to get him in the air without having a complete understanding about what he was dealing with, and they did a good job of that.

""He's moving in the right direction. I don't think it's going to jeopardize his availability at all, but it certainly may jeopardize his availability at the early portions of the week from a practice standpoint.

""Thankfully, he's fine. I'm appreciative of our medical staff and how quickly they acted in making sure he was safe and taking care of him postgame.""

Rookie defensive lineman Derrick Harmon has missed the last two games with a knee injury, but he is working his way back to the lineup.

""Derrick Harmon will be limited at the early portions of the week, and we'll let the amount of participation and how quickly it picks up and the quality of that participation as we go through the week to determine whether or not he's available,"" said Tomlin. ""Certainly excited about additional day as it pertains to him.""

With the Monday night game, the Steelers have an extra day for players to bounce back from injuries.

""Thankful that we have an additional 24 hours or so plus this week,"" said Tomlin. ""That's why we adjusted our schedules in the way that we've done. Sometimes when we play on Monday, particularly at the early stages of team development, we'll do Friday twice and hit a lot of or situational football and really get solid on some of that stuff.

""We just deemed it appropriate to give ourselves another additional 24 hours of recovery this week, and so that's why we've taken the approach that we've taken this week.

""Hopefully we'll get better clarity regarding some player availability. We'll give guys some additional time to rest and recuperate and be able to put their hand in the pile in terms of participating in the process of the game readiness, and certainly it's important this time of year that we have that as the road gets narrow.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/steelers/mgdlvcfcmimziiv3dffu,N,,2025-12-11 17:03:21.218809

Jared Wilson (ankle), Khyris Tonga (chest) and Brenden Schooler (ankle) were full participants on Wednesday, putting them all in position to return to the lineup after missing the club’s Week 13 victory over the New York Giants.

Terrell Jennings, who was knocked out of that game with a concussion, missed the first two practices of the week and is expected to be sidelined for Sunday’s matchup with the Buffalo Bills.

Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson, as a result, are the club’s only remaining options.

D’Ernest Johnson has already been elevated to the from the practice squad on three separate occasions — making him ineligible to play unless he is promoted to the active roster.

Jashaun Corbin, who returned from practice squad injured reserve in the same transaction, has played a grand total of 15 snaps in the NFL.

New England just doesn’t have any other options…

Stevenson and Henderson have occupied 92.52% of total snaps at the position in 2025, which includes a three-game absence from the former that caused some serious shuffling at the position involving the likes of Jennings, Johnson and Antonio Gibson.

The Patriots are clearly confident leaning on that duo, but they can’t enter the biggest game of their season with just two running backs on the active roster. Johnson and Corbin are the only options to join them, with the former being the better candidate.

Tyson is projected as a first-round pick with the potential to be the first wide receiver off the board, pacing receivers according to three of ESPN’s four analysts in position rankings posted on Nov. 25.

Despite missing 3.5 games this season, the redshirt junior ranks top five among Big 12 receivers in catches (61, fourth) and touchdown receptions (eight, T-5). He is 12th in yards with 711.

Injuries, such as a hamstring strain he suffered on Oct. 18 against Texas Tech and another apparent lower-body injury in the Territorial Cup, prevented him from having the season he envisioned.

NFL teams evaluating Tyson will also remember the collarbone injury that caused him to miss the 2024 postseason, as well as the knee issues that kept him off the field for most of the 2023 season.

Prior to the collarbone injury, Tyson was leading all of college football in receiving yards for the back half of the regular season (729) and had built a close connection with quarterback Sam Leavitt.

The big key for him entering the 2025 season was to cut down on drops after he had seven in 2024 and had five as a freshman in 2022 (no catches on four targets in 2023 when he battled injuries). He did so successfully with just one drop this season.

Tyson has also bulked up to NFL size over his three years at ASU, growing 1 inch to 6-foot-2 and getting up to 200 pounds after arriving to the program at 185 pounds.

But when the 44-year-old quarterback answered a call from Indianapolis Colts head coach Shane Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard on Sunday night, he realized that wasn’t what their challenge would most require.

A quarterback who knew the playbook? Rivers spent nine years with Steichen as members of the Chargers then a 10th and final NFL season with Ballard and the Colts in 2020. Have a sense of the roster? Rivers said at his (re-)introductory media conference Wednesday that he's rejoining 14 players who he played alongside with the 2020 Colts, including offensive starters in running back Jonathan Taylor, receiver Michael Pittman Jr. and tight end Mo Alie-Cox.

So when Steichen and Ballard asked, “Hey, what do you think?” Rivers couldn’t help but be interested. They told him to sleep on the decision, and he awoke Monday more adamant.

A flight to Indianapolis and a throwing session helped seal the deal. By Tuesday, from his hotel room, Steichen said Rivers told Colts brass: “Dadgummit, let’s freaking go.” Wednesday morning, the Colts announced they had signed Rivers to the practice squad.

“I'm not here to stinking save the year or be a hero by any means,” Rivers said. “We got to stinking run the crap out of the football and play defense and do all those things. So if that comes to be, and I'm the one that's out there, I'm not here to try to save the day. I'm going to know where I'm limited. And as we go, it will get better, if that's the route we end up going.

“I ain't never ran away from anybody anyway. People say, ‘Well, they're going to know you're going to be right there.’ And it's like, ‘Well, they knew that for 16, 17 years.’”

The Colts’ decision to unretire Rivers five years after his last NFL action is atypical. But so, too, was their predicament.

Advertisement

Starting quarterback Daniel Jones, who had led the Colts to a surprise 8-2 start, went from declining play due to a broken left fibula to injured reserve with a right torn Achilles. The quarterback Jones beat out in the preseason, 2023 fourth overall draft pick Anthony Richardson Sr., has yet to be cleared by doctors after sustaining an orbital fracture in a freak accident warming up for an October game. Sixth-round rookie quarterback Riley Leonard relieved Jones last Sunday — but began to realize on the plane Sunday and into Monday that he’d hurt his knee.

Leonard was able to practice Wednesday but has not yet been guaranteed his availability for a Sunday matchup vs. the 10-3 Seattle Seahawks.

And the Colts do not appear to have much confidence in journeyman Brett Rypien, also under contract.

Advertisement

So what does a team with three injured quarterbacks and a playoff berth slipping but not yet out of reach do?

Remember, this is the same franchise that plucked former offensive lineman Jeff Saturday off the ESPN airwaves to serve as its interim head coach in 2022, when Frank Reich was fired.

Longtime Colts members knew better than to be surprised.

“I’ve learned over the years to expect the unexpected,” linebacker Zaire Franklin, an eight-year Colt, said. “Unusual circumstances called for unusual answers. Thankful that we got a guy who knows the system, that knows the building, that knows the guy [and] is able to step in and help us right away.

Advertisement

“It is a crazy situation.”

Rivers and Leonard may be 22 years apart — but Colts’ QB room isn’t as random as you think

It would be fair for Leonard to have questions about the Colts bringing in a 44-year-old who hasn’t played in five years to challenge him for Sunday’s starting job.

In relief of Jones on Sunday, Leonard completed 62.1% (18 of 29) of passes for 145 yards and an interception. He rushed twice for 5 yards and a touchdown.

Leonard is a Day 3 draft pick with a banged-up knee who is “learning this business and I don’t have an opinion on it,” he said diplomatically of the signing. But in a vacuum, it should be reasonable to ask: What can a 44-year-old even do against a frenetic Seahawks front featuring the likes of Leonard Williams and DeMarcus Lawrence? Does this guy really want to do this?

Advertisement

It turns out, Leonard has reason to know better: The 23-year-old worked out with the 44-year-old then-high school coach through the spring in their shared Alabama town of Fairhope.

So Leonard knows that Rivers knows the scheme because it was Rivers he texted when the Colts drafted him, and Rivers whose house he then drove to to review the Colts’ playbook together. Leonard knows Rivers can throw after the two battled in net target throws in the spring. And Leonard knows Rivers is as competitive as he’s seen because when they raced in sprints or throwing on the run, Leonard would hear about it hours later.

“If I got him that day in particular, he’d send me a voice memo at 11 p.m. at night complaining on how I cheated and how I picked an unfair drill,” Leonard said Wednesday. “So yeah, I knew he still had [the drive]. But it is crazy.

“It is as crazy to me as it is anybody.”

Rivers rejoins the Colts five years after his last action in a 17-year career. Rivers won 134 of 240 career regular-season games, completing 64.9% of passes for 63,440 yards, 421 touchdowns and 209 interceptions.

His last NFL action came with the Colts in 2020, after 16 years with the Chargers. Rivers completed 68% of pass attempts for 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions as the Colts advanced to the playoffs.

He didn’t sit around hoping this opportunity would come again.

“Certainly I wasn’t really hanging onto any hope [of] playing again,” Rivers said. “I kind of thought that ship had sailed. But something about it excited me. And it’s kind of one of those deals that a door opens and you can either walk through it and find out if you can do it, or run from it.

Advertisement

“I know there’s risk involved obviously or what may or may not happen. But the only way to find out is going for it. And I felt almost like it was a gift and another opportunity to play and cut it loose with the guys in the game you love to play and the dream you got to live. You may get some bonus time. So I really kept it as simple as that in my mind. And here I stand.”

Do Colts have a chance to make noise with Rivers?

Playing shape and pocket movement will be the biggest questions for Rivers, even if mobility wasn’t the top trait on which his NFL success long hinged.

Mastering the game plan, by all accounts, does not seem to be a concern.

Not only did Rivers play in this system dating back to his Chargers tenure, including four years with Steichen as quarterbacks coach and then interim offensive coordinator — but also Rivers has coached his son Gunnar’s high school team this year with the same playbook. He and Steichen have reviewed concepts and how they were received throughout the season. The mental catchup, Steichen and Rivers feel, is doable.

“I told Gunnar last night, I gave him a play off the call sheet and he was like, ‘Dang, because we ran that play two weeks ago in the semifinal game,’” Rivers said. “You know what I mean? So that part's cool …

“It’s been a whirlwind of 48 hours, I’ll say. But each moment that goes by, I feel more and more confident.”

Will confidence be sufficient? Rivers is not the first player to return after a period of time away, even if the circumstances have varied. The Browns went to the playoffs during the 2023 season after signing Joe Flacco off the couch in December — but Flacco had spent 11 months away from the game, not 59. Some players have suffered injuries after sudden returns, including safety Eric Weddle tearing a pec in the 2021 season’s Super Bowl with the Los Angeles Rams and Darren Waller injuring his pec earlier this season (Waller has returned from injured reserve).

Advertisement

Rivers said he and his family are “a little scared, a little nervous.” But beyond the doubt, he believes football comes with injury risk at any age or stage. The Colts don’t need to look far to remember.

“You never hope something like that or expect something like that to happen,” Rivers said. “But shoot, something like that happens, I got a long time to recover, so that’s for sure.”

The Colts, meanwhile, feel time is ticking on the playoff window they demonstrated belief in after a trade-deadline acquisition of cornerback Sauce Gardner. Indianapolis doesn’t want to lose out on a wide-open AFC in a year when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs are set to break their seven-year streak of not just playoff berths but AFC championship berths.

Any quarterback who can help Indianapolis chase that goal is welcome, beginning with contests against the top two scoring defenses in the Seahawks (17.4 points per game) and Houston Texans (16.0)

The Colts’ playoff hopes could hinge on Rivers’ ability.

After an 8-2 start that featured wins over current playoff contenders in the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Chargers, three straight losses have followed.

Losing to the Jaguars last week knocked the Colts out of the playoff picture, their 8-5 record now eighth place in the AFC and third in the AFC South beneath the 9-4 Jaguars and 8-5 Texans (the Texans beat the Colts, giving them the tiebreaker).

The Colts currently have a 26% chance to make the playoffs, per Next Gen Stats. If they beat the Seahawks this weekend, that chance jumps to 50%, per Next Gen Stat’s model.

With that upside, Rivers wants to make a bet on his health and is willing to renounce his 2026 Pro Hall of Fame semifinalist status, his candidacy consideration delayed another five years if he plays.

He can spend time doubting his ability. Or he could take a chance.

NBC News spoke with six medical professionals with roles from orthopedic surgeon to physical therapist.
At that time, very few (if any) medical professionals wrote or spoke on television about sports injuries.
“And I saw that fantasy football was growing.” Today, she is considered one of the most trusted injury experts in sports media, co-hosting the popular “Fantasy Focus Football” podcast and making regular television appearances.
Otherwise, medical professionals are “at a disadvantage.” “They don’t have the five years of studying the body.","The injury was so gruesome that the only acceptable way to watch it was through your fingers.

Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels, dragged to the grass by a Seattle Seahawks defender on a running play last month, tried to break his fall with his left hand but ended up bending his elbow in a manner it shouldn’t be bent. Writhing in pain, he lay on his back, grimacing.

Fans in the stadium were stunned, not knowing whether their star might be out for the foreseeable future.

Countless fantasy football team owners who had Daniels on their teams had their own concern: how much time he’d miss and how it would affect their seasons.

Pulling up social media, they turned to the likes of Jeff Mueller.

Mueller is among a growing number of medical professionals who have found an audience in NFL fans, fantasy football players and sports bettors, all of whom seek information about players’ availability before official announcements are made.

Within minutes after an athlete goes down, the doctors post across Instagram, X, YouTube and TikTok their projected injury diagnoses and how many games they envision the player to miss. Later, throughout the week, they give updates on the player's game availability. What they say may either calm nerves or lead to utter panic.

“That desire for injury information has increased over the years because fantasy football has grown with multiple avenues of playing with redraft, dynasty, best ball, guillotine and various other leagues,” Mueller said. “People crave instant information and intel on topics such as injuries because it can have a big impact on their own leagues, betting, odds and other possible impacts even though we often get factual information several days later.”

Mueller is a physical therapist with more than a decade of experience at a sports medicine clinic. His background — and that of seemingly every other medical professional analyzing sports injuries on social media today — has come into question when a diagnosis is made. Are they actually qualified to provide accurate calls without X-rays or examining players in person?

NBC News spoke with six medical professionals with roles from orthopedic surgeon to physical therapist.

Like all content creators, the doctors can monetize injury analysis by driving traffic to their platforms. The larger the following, the higher the chance of financial gain. Some have under 10,000 followers, while others are in the hundreds of thousands across platforms.

But all treat patients first and look at NFL injuries second.

“This is my side hustle. This isn’t my full-time job,” said Tom Christ, a physical therapist outside Philadelphia. “So if I’m in the clinic and we get some kind of [NFL] news breaking, there’s a good chance I’m not looking at my phone for three straight hours when I’m working.”

Christ estimates he spends 10 to 15 hours per week on content creation, not including watching games. He says his game setup is fairly bare-bones: He watches NFL RedZone and takes in as many replays as possible if a player goes down.

“When an injury happens, I’ll record it on my phone and then crop it so you don’t see my walls,” he joked.

Dr. Jesse Morse’s routine is a bit more nuanced. A physician in family and sports medicine who specializes in injuries and musculoskeletal pain, he runs a clinic in Florida that focuses on regenerative medicine. On an NFL Sunday, he also watches RedZone but has a team of two to five people “that will be spotters for me” and alert him of any injury. They then make sure he has video of all the angles and an updated injury history of the player to best assess the situation.

Morse, who spends roughly 20 to 30 hours per week during the season analyzing football injuries, says his background and expertise allow him to have a strong indication of what occurred and the timetable for a player to return “within probably 20 seconds.” His aim is to have a full breakdown online in 10 minutes.

He’s quick to point out that not all injuries are created equal and that factors like previous health situations could make a diagnosis more difficult. Severity is also crucial.

Take Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, for example, who was sidelined after he was tackled by a Jacksonville Jaguars defensive lineman in Week 2.

The video of how he got hurt wasn’t immediately clear, leading Morse to ponder a multitude of questions: “Was he walking [after getting hurt]? Was he in a scooter? Which foot was it? How did it happen? Was it a contact? Was it noncontact? Does he have an injury history of this specific injury or this area of the body? Then from there, you narrow it down to the different injuries you can have for that area.”

Initially, Morse wrote that it was a “left toe injury” that was a “turf toe vs. toe fracture vs. toe dislocation.” It ended up being the former. Morse then said he was “expecting Joe Burrow to miss at the minimum four weeks but [the injury could be] potentially season-ending.” After Burrow had surgery, Morse wrote that “there’s a small chance he’s able to return in December.”

Burrow got back on the field against the Baltimore Ravens on Nov. 27.

While fans crave instant information, the doctors say they aim to not rush out a diagnosis.

“You don’t want to just get out there as fast as possible and be wrong,” Christ said. “You want to be known for being accurate. So I would personally rather take my time and really evaluate the video and then put out my thoughts.’”

Dr. Nithin Natwa, a board-certified sports physician who now works at an urgent care facility in Chicago, said specific language is key. It’s best for professionals to never say a player has an exact injury or will be out a certain amount of time because they are ultimately giving their best guesses.

“It’s really important to be measured in the language that you use and just kind of say, ‘These are possible outcomes, and it seems like it’s more likely it’s this one, but without having imaging results or physical exam, it could definitely be one of these less severe cases.’ I try to give all the options out there.”

Though they work to be as precise as possible, some other medical professionals say they aren’t sure that the standard has been met.

Stephania Bell is considered a pioneer in the field. Bell, ESPN’s senior writer and injury analyst, joined ESPN in the fall of 2007 after more than 17 years as a physical therapist and orthopedic clinical specialist. At that time, very few (if any) medical professionals wrote or spoke on television about sports injuries.

She initially found inspiration from members of her fantasy league.

“The guys I played fantasy football with knew (I treated athletes) and were asking me questions all the time, and that’s how I started to realize that the information was probably marketable,” she said. “And I saw that fantasy football was growing.”

Today, she is considered one of the most trusted injury experts in sports media, co-hosting the popular “Fantasy Focus Football” podcast and making regular television appearances. The one place you won’t find her, however, is on social media giving instant prognostications about injuries.

Because she doesn’t have access to any imaging and isn’t examining a player in person, she prefers to wait until a team releases an official update or one of ESPN’s many “insiders” provides the latest.

Being right matters more to her than being first.

“The medical folks who are actually covering the teams don’t love it that people are ripping off these diagnoses,” she said. “They’re frustrated because they’re like, ‘I can tell you how much more goes into it with being there, and we still don’t always know.’ So I understand there’s an appetite for quick information, but for me, in my professional lifetime, that’s just not where I’m gonna live.”

Dr. Christopher Cooke took it a step further. Cooke, an orthopedic surgeon outside Detroit who was a team doctor with the Tigers and a consultant for the Red Wings, said fans must be skeptical about what they see online.

“There’s a lot of armchair doctor people out there who make comments,” he said. “Not to sound too boisterous, I don’t think the majority of them really know what’s going on.”

Cooke was in a five-year orthopedic surgery residency followed by a one-year sports medicine fellowship at Kerlan Jobe Medical Center in Los Angeles. It was there that ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction — or Tommy John surgery — was first conducted.

Cooke said experience is needed to be able to properly diagnose an injury. Otherwise, medical professionals are “at a disadvantage.”

“They don’t have the five years of studying the body. They don’t have the hands-on experience. They’ve never held an ACL in their hand as they reconstructed it. It’s someone who certainly could fit a role, but they’re not an expert in the area.”

“There’s only a finite amount of people I really trust what they say,” he said later. “And oftentimes these people online don’t have the training to make the right comments, but they have enough knowledge to just spout out something. Oftentimes, in my opinion, they’re very, very wrong.”

Though most take extra caution when they make diagnoses, specifically saying a certain injury or timetable is “possible” or “likely,” there are times when the medical professionals miss the mark.

After Arizona Cardinals running back Trey Benson injured a knee on Sept. 25, Natwa went on Instagram and said he should return in five to seven weeks. Instead, two months later, the team announced he wouldn’t be back at all this season.

Dr. Tarek Souryal is an orthopedic surgeon who was a longtime team doctor for the Dallas Mavericks. While he agreed with Cooke that some online doctors may not have the proper credentials — and urged fans to be wary of diagnoses off video alone — they are knowledgeable enough for what they are being asked to give out.

“If I was using purely the video to perform surgery on Kobe Bryant, that would be extraordinarily dangerous and frankly malpractice,” Souryal said. “However, if I’m looking at a video and I’m saying, ‘I think he ruptured his Achilles tendon, that’s what the video tape looks like it shows, and I wouldn’t count on him being back in the next four to six months,’ I don’t think there’s any harm in making that kind of speculation.”

Colts quarterback Daniel Jones was arguably the biggest surprise early on in the NFL season. Jones, once the longtime New York Giants signal-caller, led Indianapolis to an 8-2 start and drew early MVP buzz. But injuries in recent weeks led to a decline in his play, and things took a turn for the worse Sunday: He sustained a season-ending Achilles injury.

Shortly after the game, Natwa took to Instagram for a full video breakdown.

“We see him take a false step back,” he says, pointing to a slo-mo replay. “It’s where you start a step back and your ankle is put in an extreme acute angle, really loading the Achilles. As you’re pushing off, the Achilles has an increased risk of rupturing.”

Natwa said he doesn’t just want to give an injury label and a timetable. His goal is to educate with longer videos, even though it may take more work. He spends around 36 hours a week on football injury analysis.

It has led to some minor fame, though not in his own house.

“Some guy saw me in a coffee shop where we live, and he recognized me,” he said. “He was like, ‘Oh, man, you’re the fantasy doc.’ And [my wife was] like, ‘Oh, my God, is this that fantasy football thing that no one watches?’ And the guy at the coffee shop was like, ‘No, no. We all watch it. We watch his videos.’ She was so annoyed.”

Evan Jeffries, a physical therapist based in San Diego who breaks down injuries in all sports, not just football, has a bit more sympathy from his family.

“My kids think it’s funny. They love it,” he said. “They think I’m famous, and I tell them I’m definitely not famous.”

For Morse — who says he earns $25,000 to $50,000 per year on average analyzing football injuries — money isn’t why he does it.

“I’m a fantasy fan first, then I happen to be a doctor, and then I happen to be a specialist in sports medicine. I’m just crazy passionate about it. If you’re not, you don’t have the time to do this,” he said. “If you were to call up any random sports medicine doctor [or] orthopedic surgeon and say, ‘Hey, what happened to Jayden Daniels yesterday?’ There’s going to be like, ‘What the hell are you talking about?’”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/20251010NBCNewsfantasy-footballfinalv3-7fe1a5.png",N,,2025-12-11 18:03:03.585887

""If I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing this,"" Burrow told reporters Wednesday. ""I have been through a lot. If it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That is the mindset I am trying to bring to the table.""

Burrow started the first two games of the season for Cincinnati, but suffered a toe injury in Week 2 that kept him out until he was able to make his return against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 13.

The Bengals own a 3-1 record with Burrow under center this year, but their playoff hopes are rapidly fading largely due to a 1-8 mark in the nine games he missed.

If Cincinnati is ultimately eliminated from postseason contention, it would mark the third consecutive year that the team misses the playoffs. The Bengals' recent struggles are especially disappointing given their Super Bowl appearance during the 2021 season and AFC Championship Game appearance the following year.

As for Burrow, the two-time Pro Bowler has still been effective despite his limited playing time this season. He's completed 59.3 percent of his throws for 734 yards and eight touchdowns compared to a pair of interceptions.

Still, 2025 marked the third season that Burrow suffered a significant injury in his NFL career. His rookie year came to an end due to a torn ACL and his 2023 campaign was cut short by a season-ending wrist injury.","https://gsp-image-cdn.wmsports.io/cms/prod/bleacher-report/ap_images/0456d76f0df94beb912bbc74490e16f0/Bengals_Bills_Football_25125_4351x2448_(0,147).jpg?w=3800&h=2000",N,,2025-12-11 15:03:52.128775

Let’s start with the good: Rookie left guard Jared Wilson was a full participant in Wednesday’s practice after sitting out Week 13 due to an ankle injury. Wilson, who started at left guard for 11 of the first 12 games, seemingly is on track to return for this Sunday’s home game against the Buffalo Bills.

Now for the bad news: Left tackle Vederian Lowe was limited in Wednesday’s practice due to an abdominal injury. The severity of the injury remains unclear, but the Patriots, who’ll be without rookie Will Campbell for at least the next three weeks, would be in dire straits at left tackle if Lowe were forced to miss time.

You could make the case that Washington's two primary needs are edge rusher and wide receiver. Due to their terrible season, the Commanders currently sit at No. 6 in the 2026 NFL draft order, with the potential to rise in the coming weeks. Washington should be in a position to land one of the draft's top prospects.

Much of the Commanders' draft strategy will be impacted by what they do in free agency. Regardless, it's a good bet that Washington looks for a pass rusher or a wide receiver with its first pick. One of the debates facing the Commanders is should they trade down if they land a top-five pick? They are without second and fourth-round picks in the upcoming draft due to the Laremy Tunsil trade.

Carnell Tate (Ohio State) and Jordyn Tyson (Arizona State) are considered the top receiver prospects in 2026. Both should land somewhere inside the top 15. Louisville wide receiver Chris Bell is another first-round prospect. Unfortunately, his first-round status could be in jeopardy. ESPN's Adam Schefter revealed on Wednesday that Bell suffered a torn ACL in Louisville's November 22 game against SMU.

While Washington wouldn't have been a potential pick for the Commanders inside the top five, he would've been an ideal candidate if there was a trade down. At 6-foot-2, 220 pounds, Bell is a bigger, younger version of current Washington receiver Deebo Samuel. In addition to his size, power and ability to create yards after the catch, Bell has 4.4 speed. Bell also excels in contested-catch situations.

It's an unfortunate injury for Bell. However, it doesn't necessarily mean he'll fall far. Washington guard Sam Cosmi tore his ACL in late January and was back in the lineup in October. So, while all injuries are different, Bell could be back for Week 1 of his rookie season.","https://commanderswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/11/SCMD/87712277007-usatsi-27146491.jpg?crop=5413,3046,x0,y136&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-11 15:04:06.202448

It's encouraging news after Odunze failed to practice in any capacity before Week 14.

The Bears did not place Odunze on injured reserve (IR), which would have required at least four games missed. This suggests that if the injury had been long-term, the team would likely have placed him on IR. Instead, it would make sense for Odunze to return soon.

Odunze is the Bears’ leading receiver in 2025 with 661 yards on 44 catches. He has six touchdowns.

He suffered a stress fracture in his foot that left him week-to-week, per the NFL Network. However, Odunze's limited practice participation to start Week 15 indicates he has a chance to return Sunday against Cleveland. His practice status on Thursday and Friday will be key to his potential return to action after missing just one game.

Bears WR depth chart

Here's a look at who the Bears will have at WR if Odunze remains sidelined:

Rome Odunze (injured)

DJ Moore

Luther Burden

Olamide Zaccheaus

Devin Duvernay

Jahdae Walker

With Odunze sidelined in Week 14, it was expected that veteran DJ Moore would see increased volume, but he managed just one catch on three targets for -4 yards. Rookie second-rounder Luther Burden made the most of his expanded role, leading the team in catches and yards in Week 14. The veteran Zaccheaus provides solid play from the slot receiver position but isn't much of a red zone threat.

Tight ends Cole Kmet and Colston Loveland have also been tasked with more receiving work.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/11/USAT/87711435007-usatsi-27545848.jpg?crop=3361,1891,x400,y195&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-11 18:03:09.783870

The Bengals’ star quarterback had some curious comments during a press conference Wednesday that many thought were alarming.

“If I want to keep doing this, then what am I trying to do with myself?” Burrow told reporters. “And I have to have fun doing it. You know, if it’s not fun, then what am I doing it for? So, that’s the mindset.”

Burrow just returned from a severe Grade 3 turf toe injury, missing a majority of the season after suffering the injury in Week 2.

Since returning, Burrow has led the Bengals to a win over the Ravens and a high-scoring loss in Buffalo to the Bills that all but ended Cincinnati’s playoff hopes.

“Do I have fun playing?” Burrow asked while at the press conference. “I mean, how much? Winning’s always fun, but in general, was it as fun as before? No, I wouldn’t say it was that way.”

The Bengals currently have the No. 28-ranked offensive line according to Pro Football Focus, and he’s being pressured on 23.3 percent of his dropbacks, among the worst figures in the NFL

Burrow has suffered numerous injuries in his NFL career as he’s tried to put the Bengals on his back, leading them to a Super Bowl loss to the Rams in 2022.

This will now likely be the third straight season the Bengals have missed the playoffs.

Burrow was asked if there was a turning point that made him enjoy the game less.

“The changing point? I’m not sure there was a singular moment or time,” Burrow said. “Reflection — reflection on a lot of things that I’ve done and been through in my career, I think. And I’ve been through more than most. Certainly not easy on the brain or body, so just trying to have fun doing it again.”

Burrow ominously added, “Ummm, there’s just a lot of things going on right now — football-related, personally, all the above.”

Burrow was distressed last season after a break-in at his home, in which the only person at his residence was model Olivia Ponton.

The two have since been spotted together are are believed to be dating.

On the field, Burrow is among the most hit quarterbacks in the NFL on a yearly basis.

There were rumblings that the Bengals’ superstar signal caller had reservations about playing in Cincinnati while he was starring at LSU.

Some implored the Heisman trophy winner to “pull an Eli Manning” and tell the Bengals to trade the pick ahead of the draft.

Burrow wound up going to the Bengals, where he got abused behind one of the league’s worst offensive lines in 2020, eventually resulting in him tearing his ACL as a rookie.

Some have speculated that these comments could be a precursor to an early retirement or a trade demand.

It certainly is possible that his frustration is with the team, which seemingly can’t solve offensive line issues and continues to botch contract negotiations with players, as the Bengals’ owners, the Brown family, are known as one of the cheapest in the NFL.

Burrow threw four touchdown passes against Buffalo, but also tossed two critical interceptions in the snow that doomed Cincinnati.

The NFL's concussion protocol is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury.","The Dallas Cowboys (6-6-1) saw their playoff hopes dwindle after losing in Week 14.

Cowboys star receiver CeeDee Lamb was injured in the loss and entered the NFL's concussion protocol.

Dallas hosts the Minnesota Vikings (5-8) on ""Sunday Night Football"" in Week 15. The question remaining is whether the star wide receiver will be available as the Cowboys cling to their playoff hopes.

He logged a limited practice Wednesday to begin the week but still has yet to clear the protocol.

Dallas is outside of the playoff picture and has little room for error over the final four games. The Cowboys are battling to stay in the NFC East race and fans are hopeful their All-Pro wide receiver will be available this week.

Here's the latest on Lamb.

CeeDee Lamb injury update

Lamb remains in the NFL's concussion protocol as of Wednesday, Dec. 10. It is unclear how much time he might miss, if any.

Lamb was quickly ruled out with a concussion after hitting his head on the turf in the Cowboys' Week 14 ""Thursday Night Football"" game in Detroit.

On Wednesday, head coach Brian Schottenheimer provided an update on Lamb.

“CeeDee is progressing nicely through the process, the protocol,” Schottenheimer said. “He has two more things he’s gotta get done, but I feel good about that.”

Lamb will have two more chances to practice fully this week before the Cowboys likely tag him with a designation ahead of Sunday's game against the Vikings.

It has typically been a challenge for players to return the following week after suffering a concussion, but Lamb is benefiting from the extended rest because Dallas played last Thursday. He appears to be trending towards playing this week.

What is the NFL's concussion protocol?

The NFL's concussion protocol is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury. It's a five-step process that a player must complete before they can return to play. Those steps are, as defined by the NFL:

Symptom-limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football-specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Full football activity/clearance

Before a player enters the protocol, they are evaluated on the sideline. The tests are conducted by the team's physician and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant. The evaluation includes observing any ""no-go"" symptoms, which are things like loss of consciousness, confusion, amnesia, and more, in addition to a history of concussions, other signs/symptoms, and video review.

At that point, a neurological exam is conducted and the player is escorted to the locker room if the sideline evaluation leaves any doubt.

Cowboys WR depth chart

Here's a look at the Cowboys' WR depth chart:

CeeDee Lamb (injured)

George Pickens

Ryan Flournoy

KaVontae Turpin

Jonathan Mingo

Dallas played three games this season without Lamb after he suffered a high ankle sprain in Week 4. The star missed Weeks 4-6, and Pickens emerged as a significant weapon.

Flournoy and Turpin have each been effective in their roles, while Mingo is a depth piece. Flournoy has flashed at times and even produced a massive 115 yards on nine catches in Week 14 after Lamb exited the game.

Jalen Tolbert has fallen out of the rotation and was a healthy inactive for ""Thursday Night Football"" in Detroit last week.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/10/USAT/87708798007-2250055732.jpg?crop=1696,954,x711,y520&width=1696&height=954&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-11 13:05:01.707276

Unfortunately, a long string of injuries to the Buccaneers' receiving corps have kept that vision from being realized in 2025.

Until now.

On Wednesday, the Buccaneers activated Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan from injured reserve, making both available to play on Thursday night against the Atlanta Falcons. Evans and McMillan are both questionable on the injury report for the game, but if they suit up it will mark the first time that those two, Godwin and Egbuka are active for the same game.

To make room on the 53-man roster for the return of Evans and McMillan, the Buccaneers waived defensive lineman C.J. Brewer and wide receiver Ryan Miller.

Evans, who is the Buccaneers' all-time leader in virtually every receiving category, is back after missing six games due to a fractured collarbone sustained in Detroit in Week Seven. He also missed three games earlier in the season with a hamstring strain, which happened to coincide exactly with Godwin's return to action after sitting out the first three contests. Godwin also missed five midseason games with a fibula injury. McMillan sustained a neck injury in the second game of the preseason and has been on injured reserve since the start of the regular season.

In his limited playing time in 2025, Evans has secured 14 receptions for 140 yards and one touchdown. His career totals include 850 receptions for 12,824 yards and 106 touchdowns and he is the first player in NFL history to surpass 1,000 receiving yards in each of his first 11 seasons. Evans ranks 10th in NFL history in touchdown receptions and has made six Pro Bowls, including the last two.

McMillan was a third-round pick out of Washington in 2024 and after a slow start to his rookie campaign due to injuries he caught fire down the stretch, finishing with 37 catches for 461 yards. Most of that came during the last five weeks, when he surpassed 50 receiving yards in every game and led all NFL players in that span with seven touchdown receptions.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/buccaneers/pgwg4cziqwhmbptaux3d,N,,2025-12-11 14:01:32.662236

,,2025-12-11 03:27:39+00:00,CBS Sports,How recent injury changed Joe Burrow's career outlook: 'I've been through a lot',Bryan DeArdo,,,,,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/bengals-quarterback-joe-burrow-injury-career-outlook/,"Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow turned 29 on Wednesday, but he was not in a celebratory mood.
You know, I've been through a lot, and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for?
During the Bengals' tenth game of the 2023 season, Burrow sustained a wrist injury that required season-ending surgery.
""It's certainly something you have to think about,"" Burrow said when asked about risk-reward element of playing through injury.
""It's just a reflection on a lot of things that I've done and been through in my career,"" he said.","Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow turned 29 on Wednesday, but he was not in a celebratory mood. He acknowledged that ""there's just a lot of things going on right now"" during a subdued press conference that also included him sharing new perspective following his most recent injury.

""It certainly doesn't change my desire to win,"" said Burrow, who is preparing for his third game after missing nine weeks with turf toe. ""You know, if I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it. You know, I've been through a lot, and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That's the mindset I'm trying to bring to the table.""

Burrow, on the heels of a tough road loss to the Buffalo Bills, was asked if it's hard to have fun given his injury and the Bengals' 4-9 record.

""Certainly,"" he said with Sunday's home game with the Baltimore Ravens looming.

When healthy, Burrow has been one of the NFL's best quarterbacks since he entered the league in 2020. But health has largely eluded him to this point in his career.

Pete Prisco

A knee injury sidelined him for the second half of his rookie season. Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl the following year, but he sustained an MCL sprain during Cincinnati's Super Bowl loss to the Los Angeles Rams.

After rehabbing that injury during the offseason, Burrow missed a significant portion of training camp after he had an emergency appendectomy for a ruptured appendix. A year later, Burrow missed a little over a month after injuring his calf during the first day of training camp.

During the Bengals' tenth game of the 2023 season, Burrow sustained a wrist injury that required season-ending surgery. He returned in 2024 and led the NFL with 4,918 yards and 43 touchdowns en route to winning NFL Comeback Player of the Year for a second time.

""It's certainly something you have to think about,"" Burrow said when asked about risk-reward element of playing through injury. ""That's that's life as a professional athlete, no different than basketball and MMA, baseball. It's what we chose. [We] make a lot of sacrifices, and your body is often one of them.""

Given all of his injuries, it's easy to see why Burrow has decided to put more of an emphasis on enjoying himself for as long as he continues playing.

""It's just a reflection on a lot of things that I've done and been through in my career,"" he said. ""I think I've been through more than most and certainly not easy on the brain or the body. So, just trying to have fun doing it.""

Burrow is often compared to Andrew Luck, the former Indianapolis Colts quarterback and No. 1 pick who retired at 29 after injuries had diminished his desire to continue playing. And while Burrow's comments will undoubtedly conjure up more Luck comparisons, he didn't say anything on Wednesday that would suggest that he is planning to hang up his cleats anytime soon.

Burrow, who is under contract through the 2029 season, is likely frustrated with his team's current situation. Burrow underwent a grueling rehabilitation process in order to make it back from his toe injury sooner than most people expected. He was hoping that the Bengals would win enough games without him so they could go on a legitimate playoff run when he did return.

That didn't happen, however, as the Bengals (who were 2-0 at the time of his injury) won just one game during his absence. And while their playoff hopes are still technically alive, that isn't giving Burrow much solace.

""I don't think anybody's really thinking about the playoffs right now,"" he said. ""That's within reach, but it's on our fingertips, so we've got to keep doing what we're doing and try to get better.""

While the majority of the presser was dark, Burrow cracked a smile when asked about the Pokémon box he received from his offensive linemen as a birthday gift. He was specifically asked what exactly is a Pokémon.

""I'll let you research that,"" he said in a rare moment of fun.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/10/a32c829e-107d-4332-9e6a-486b70cdd311/thumbnail/1200x675/0240e54cce9990e43a919daaf5ecb733/burrow14.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 23:58:23.903109

Leonard made his unofficial NFL debut on Sunday after Daniel Jones left the game in the first quarter with a torn Achilles.
""It's very difficult, but that's the nature of the game,"" Leonard said on Sunday after the game.
That won't change this week, either – even with 44-year-old Philip Rivers joining the Colts' practice squad and being evaluated for his readiness to start on Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks.","Riley Leonard was a full participant in the Colts' Wednesday practice before their Week 15 game against the Seattle Seahawks; the rookie quarterback was cleared to return to practice after sustaining a knee injury on Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

""It feels good,"" Leonard said Wednesday before practice. ""They cleared me for practice, so excited to get back out there, test it out a little bit. But feels really good.""

Leonard made his unofficial NFL debut on Sunday after Daniel Jones left the game in the first quarter with a torn Achilles. Leonard played three full quarters, completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards with an interception and a rushing touchdown in the Colts' 36-19 loss. Another touchdown pass to Michael Pittman Jr. was taken off the board due to an offensive pass interference call.

""It's very difficult, but that's the nature of the game,"" Leonard said on Sunday after the game. ""Obviously, your first thought is to pray for Daniel and hope he's great because that's not how you envision getting snaps, right? I always envision myself working and working and developing into a starter, (a position) that I earned. Whether I earned it or not is kind of irrelevant. Daniel went down; my turn was up. It's super unfortunate to see that, but hopefully everything works out. We'll be praying for him for sure.""

Leonard has operated with uncertainty throughout the entire season. He started out as a third-string rookie who, realistically, wouldn't set foot on the field. Then, when Anthony Richardson Sr. sustained a fractured orbital bone, Leonard was promoted to the backup quarterback behind Jones and became just one play away from seeing game action.

Nothing changed for Leonard at any point in that process, though; he prepared the same way every week, no matter what. That won't change this week, either – even with 44-year-old Philip Rivers joining the Colts' practice squad and being evaluated for his readiness to start on Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks.

Head coach Shane Steichen said Wednesday that they would ""see how the week goes"" for both quarterbacks and make a decision at the end of the week. So, until then, Leonard is only focused on one thing: what he can do for himself.

""As far as I know, I'm going to go out there and give it my best,"" he said. ""I'm just here to play my best, be my best at practice today.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/ledu3nvbgxwq2zvtor5b,N,,2025-12-11 12:07:25.792980

Overall, Herbert added that the status of his hand is in a much better place than it was a week ago.
Perhaps that's because Herbert was out there trying to stiff arm the Eagles defense with that broken left hand.
""I think it's huge because you want to be playing memorable football in December and January, and meaningful games,"" Herbert said.
""For us to be able to battle one out like that helps everyone in the locker room and gives everyone confidence,"" Herbert added.","Justin Herbert offered an update on his broken left hand Wednesday, saying that he got got precautionary X-rays on it immediately following Monday night's win over the Eagles.

The results were good.

""Everything was clean for the most part,"" Herbert said. ""It's just getting the swelling down and continuing to get full strength in it and continuing to do as much treatment as I can.""

He later added: ""Just took a couple hits, I think the doctors were making sure they're doing everything they can to just take a look and be as safe as possible.""

Overall, Herbert added that the status of his hand is in a much better place than it was a week ago.

""It's a lot better now. I think it was just sore. I think having played on it, using it and falling on it, too, I think that kind of helped and was some of the reason why it was sore,"" Herbert said. ""I think for the most part, it's gotten a lot better, I feel like my grip strength has gotten better and just being able to use it has gotten better, too.""

As for his performance in primetime, the Chargers quarterback said he could have been sharper after throwing for just 139 yards and committing two turnovers.

According to NFL Next Gen Stats, Herbert was pressured on 68.3 percent of his dropbacks, the sixth-highest percentage in a game over the last 10 seasons among quarterbacks with at least 20 dropbacks.

""I thought it was a really tough day for the offense, especially for me,"" Herbert said. ""I had two turnovers, and I missed a lot of throws and played uncharacteristically, and there's a bunch of plays that I'd love to have back, a few balls that I missed outside.

""I think those are going to happen. It's unfortunate that we didn't play to the expectations that we hold for ourselves, but I thought we did a great job battling all four quarters and in overtime because it looked pretty grim there for a while,"" Herbert continued.

""For us to keep battling and go get the special teams out on the field and get some points, it's obviously not what we want, but to get the win and the defense the way they played, and special teams, it's what was best for us,"" Herbert added.

Perhaps that's because Herbert was out there trying to stiff arm the Eagles defense with that broken left hand.

Herbert smiled Wednesday when asked about the play and said he might have had some regrets about attempting it.

""Yeah, maybe after if it wasn't very effective,"" Herbert said. ""But in the moment, I think that was the best thing I could've done for the team — getting the first down and doing everything I can to be able to get around the edge.

""There's a world where it is effective and maybe I'm staying on my feet and getting more yards. I'm glad everything went well and I'm feeling better because of it,"" Herbert added.

Even so, the Chargers were able to grind out a primetime win against the defending Super Bowl champions and improve to 9-4.

Herbert suggested Wednesday that Monday night's win could be helpful for the Bolts as they get ready for a daunting four-game stretch that includes Sunday's road game in Kansas City.

""I think it's huge because you want to be playing memorable football in December and January, and meaningful games,"" Herbert said. ""Those are the type of games that you need to win, against opponents we have a ton of respect for and are very good.

""For us to be able to battle one out like that helps everyone in the locker room and gives everyone confidence,"" Herbert added. ""Going through games like that, it's only going to help you in the long run.""

According to The Athletic, the Chargers current playoff odds are at 78 percent.

Those odds can jump to 95 percent with a win Sunday in Kansas City.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/chargers/ichtyzhqjazccru6ssvr,N,,2025-12-10 21:58:51.348990

The injury creates uncertainty for Jones, who is heading into free agency.

Before the injury, Jones was headed towards a long-term extension with Indianapolis.

INDIANAPOLIS — Colts starting quarterback Daniel Jones had surgery to repair his torn Achilles tendon.

Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen said the quarterback’s surgery went well.

Jones now faces the uncertainty of heading into free agency with a torn Achilles tendon. Before the injury, Jones was in line to get an extension to be the Colts’ quarterback of the future.

A recovery for an Achilles tendon typically takes nine months to a year, a timetable that could threaten Jones’ ability to start the 2026 season.

If the Colts believe he will be healthy, Jones could be back in Indianapolis. Jones completed 68% of his passes for 3,101 yards, 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions, and he rushed for five touchdowns despite playing more from the pocket than he ever did in New York.

In the process, Jones carved out a critical role in the locker room.

“The work that he puts in and the effort on a day-to-day basis,” Steichen said Monday. “The grind. A team captain for us, just very unfortunate. One of the toughest guys I've ever been around, so just praying for a speedy recovery for him.”

From the sounds of it, Jones’ recovery has already begun, with news that a successful surgery has already taken place.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/PIND/87658464007-2250563329.jpg?crop=5928,3335,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 23:58:30.632743

Pro Bowl left guard Landon Dickerson was sidelined briefly on Monday night against the Los Angeles Chargers due to a calf injury. Despite missing 12 offensive snaps in the overtime battle, Dickerson would have practiced for the Eagles on Wednesday as a limited participant.

The team held a walkthrough on Wednesday, so the injury report is an estimation.

While there's good news regarding Dickerson, All-Pro right tackle Lane Johnson remains sidelined with a foot injury. He would not have practiced on Wednesday. Johnson suffered the injury in the Week 11 win over Detroit. Fred Johnson replaced Lane Johnson against the Lions and has started the last three games.

Defensive tackle Jalen Carter would have been the only other Eagle on the active roster to miss practice on Wednesday. Carter is sidelined with injuries to both shoulders. He did not play on Monday night against the Chargers. The Eagles opened against Los Angeles with a four-man front, anchored by Jordan Davis and Moro Ojomo in the middle at defensive tackle. Byron Young played 32 snaps on Monday night, one week after a season-high 38, to help pick up the slack in Carter's absence.

The Eagles opened long snapper Charley Hughlett's 21-day practice window on Wednesday. Hughlett has not played since the Week 4 win over the Buccaneers due to an abdominal injury. He would have been a full participant. The Eagles waived Hughlett's replacement Cal Adomitis on Tuesday.

Rookie offensive tackle Myles Hinton's 21-day practice window expired, so he will remain on Injured Reserve for the rest of the year with a back injury.

QB Geno Smith, DE Maxx Crosby sidelined for Raiders on Wednesday

All signs point to former Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett returning to Lincoln Financial Field for a start in his homecoming this Sunday afternoon.

The Raiders' quarterback entered Sunday's loss to the Broncos at the start of the fourth quarter after starter Geno Smith exited with a shoulder injury.

In the two full drives led by Pickett, the Raiders scored 10 of their 17 points.

Smith did not practice on Wednesday.

That's not the only injury to monitor for the Raiders.

Starting safety Jeremy Chinn missed Wednesday's practice with a back injury. Chinn posted 11 tackles and a sack against the Broncos on Sunday, playing every snap on defense. The Raiders added Chinn to the injury report last Friday and he was questionable for the Broncos game.

Defensive end Maxx Crosby also missed Wednesday's practice with knee and shoulder injuries. Crosby also played every snap on defense and finished with four tackles and a sack of Broncos quarterback Bo Nix. Crosby did not practice last Thursday or Friday due to the knee injury (the shoulder is a new addition to the injury report). Crosby, like Chinn, was questionable to play against Denver.

The Raiders opened starting left tackle Kolton Miller's practice window on Wednesday. He was limited with an ankle injury that has sidelined him since the end of September.

It was just where we were in the game,"" Quinn said.","ASHBURN, Va. -- Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels won't play Sunday against the New York Giants, coach Dan Quinn said Wednesday.

Daniels was knocked from Sunday's 31-0 loss to the Minnesota Vikings after landing hard on his left elbow, which he had dislocated in Week 9. Quinn said Daniels could have returned to the game, but with the score 17-0 late in the third quarter, the coach decided to insert backup Marcus Mariota.

Quinn said that Daniels aggravated the injury but that further examinations by doctors Monday showed that there was no structural damage or setback. Quinn said there is a chance Daniels will return the following week against the Philadelphia Eagles.

Daniels was participating in individual drills Wednesday during the portion of practice open to the media, and Quinn said they haven't yet considered shutting Daniels down for the season.

""As far as what decisions are ahead, we haven't gone down that road,"" Quinn said. ""He's working fairly hard to get back with the guys.""

Sunday will mark the seventh game Daniels has missed because of injury this season. He left each of his past three games because of an injury. After dislocating the elbow against the Seattle Seahawks, Daniels missed the ensuing three games but was cleared to return last week. That was the first time Daniels and his top three receivers were available in the same game this season since Week 2.

While trying to chase down linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel after a third-quarter interception, Daniels was blocked to the ground. He briefly remained on the ground after the play, then ran off the field and to the bench, showing frustration.

Daniels' second season has been hampered by injuries. He missed two games with a sprained left knee, another with a hamstring issue and then the three because of the initial elbow injury.

Quinn said the decision to keep Daniels from returning against Minnesota was because of the score and not due to any lingering fallout stemming from the Seattle game. Daniels was hurt with 7 minutes, 39 seconds left against the Seahawks with the score 38-7, and Quinn said he regretted not pulling him from an eventual 24-point loss.

""[That game] didn't weigh on me. It was just where we were in the game,"" Quinn said. ""It wasn't going like we wanted, and I thought it was the best call. It wasn't a difficult one that I wrestled with in that spot. I said I was going to make the best decision for him and the team.

""He wasn't happy about it. This is the best decision right now, and I'll continue to do that whether it was him or anybody else in that spot.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1207%2Fr1586376_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 19:59:37.744568

Smith exited the Raiders' 24-17 Week 14 loss to the Denver Broncos. Pickett took over in the fourth quarter. He went 8 of 11 for 97 yards and a passing touchdown.

The Raiders acquired Pickett in August in a trade with the Cleveland Browns. It marked the third time the former Pittsburgh Steelers first-round pick was traded since the start of the 2024 season.

Of course, as we get down to the finish line, these final matchups will carry monumental stakes.

Already, the Week 15 slate has a handful of clinching scenarios. The New England Patriots can clinch the AFC East title with a win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, while both the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Rams can punch their tickets with wins.

While all we want to dissect heading into this crucial stretch is how these teams match up on the field, injuries will be a storyline. Given that we're so late in the year, just about every team is dinged up to some degree, and that could dictate how some of these games turn out.

As most clubs get back onto the practice field for the first time on Wednesday, we'll take the temperature of where they stand health-wise as they release their initial injury report. We'll also look at the final injury report and game designations for Thursday's NFC South matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

It's another week that the Falcons will be without top wideout Drake London, who'll miss his fourth straight game due to a knee injury. Meanwhile, Kyle Pitts and edge rusher Jalon Walker are questionable after being limited on Wednesday. On a more positive note, corner A.J. Terrell (neck) was a full participant on Wednesday and carries no injury designation.

The Buccaneers are expected to get wideout Mike Evans back after missing the bulk of the year due to a collarbone injury he suffered in Week 7. Despite being listed as questionable, head coach Todd Bowles said Evans has shown everything he needed to in practice to make his return. Both Evans and Jalen McMillan have also been activated off injured reserve.

Buffalo Bills at New England Patriots (-1.5)

The Bills were without tight end Dawson Knox to begin the week of practice due to personal reasons. Outside of that, everyone was accounted for as defensive end Joey Bosa (hamstring, wrist), linebacker Terrel Bernard (elbow), offensive lineman Spencer Brown (shoulder), and Josh Palmer (ankle) were limited.

Running back Terrell Jennings (concussion) was the lone player missing from Patriots practice on Wednesday. Defensive tackle Christian Barmore (not injury related) was limited, along with linebacker Harold Landry and offensive tackle Vederian Lowe.

Las Vegas Raiders at Philadelphia Eagles (-11.5)

Geno Smith is dealing with a shoulder injury and is unlikely to play on Sunday. The veteran did not practice on Wednesday, which puts Kenny Pickett in line to start in Week 15. Las Vegas also designated offensive tackle Kolton Miller to return from injured reserve.

Los Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (-4.5)

The Chiefs held out receiver Hollywood Brown (personal), offensive lineman Wanya Morris (knee), and offensive tackle Jawaan Taylor (triceps, knee) from practice to begin the week. Corner Trent McDuffie (knee) was limited.

New York Jets at Jacksonville Jaguars (-12.5)

The Jets were missing 10 players on Wednesday, which included quarterback Justin Fields (knee) and Tyrod Taylor (groin). If neither can play, that would throw Brady Cook in as the starter in all likelihood. Running back Breece Hall (knee), edge rusher Jermaine Johnson II (rest), linebacker Kiko Mauigoa (neck), defensive lineman Harrison Phillips, tight end Stone Smartt (concussion), tight end Mason Taylor (neck), corner Azareye'h Thomas (shoulder), and linebacker Quincy Williams (hand) were also held out.

Jacksonville listed quarterback Trevor Lawrence as a limited participant in practice on Wednesday due to an ankle injury. Receiver Parker Washington (hip), tight end Quintin Morris (ankle), offensive lineman Ezra Cleveland (shoulder), offensive lineman Walker Little (concussion), safety Andrew Wingard (concussion), and defensive lineman B.J. Green II (knee) were also limited.

Washington Commanders at New York Giants (-2.5)

Commanders head coach Dan Quinn announced Wednesday that Jayden Daniels re-aggravated his left elbow injury against the Vikings and will be held out for Week 15. Marcus Mariota will start. Meanwhile, defensive end Drake Jackson (groin, knee), corner Jonathan Jones (rib), outside linebacker Von Miller (rest), running back Chris Rodriguez Jr. (groin), offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil (rest), and linebacker Bobby Wagner (knee) did not practice.

New York opened up the week of practice without several players: defensive lineman D.J.

Tight end Theo Johnson (toe) was limited.

Baltimore Ravens (-2.5) at Cincinnati Bengals

Lamar Jackson did not practice on Wednesday, which is becoming a weekly occurrence. This marks the fifth straight week where the Ravens quarterback has missed at least one day of practice. This time, the team noted that it was merely a rest day. Corner Chidobe Awuzie (shoulder) also did not practice, while running back Keaton Mitchell (knee), outside linebacker Tavius Robinson (foot), and corner Nate Wiggins (foot) were limited.

Cincinnati cleared rookie pass rusher Shemar Stewart (knee) to practice and designated him to return from injured reserve. He was a full participant on Wednesday, while receiver Tee Higgins (concussion) was limited. Defensive end Trey Hendrickson (hip, pelvis) was listed as a non-participant, but he is not expected to return to the team this season after undergoing surgery.

Jennings, the lone absence in Foxborough on Wednesday, exited in the second quarter against the New York Giants as the calendar turned to December. The 2024 undrafted arrival from Florida A&M was downgraded to out for what became a 33-15 win. He played seven snaps on special teams that night, beginning with a 39-yard kickoff return, and was the third backfield option behind Rhamondre Stevenson and NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month TreVeyon Henderson.

Landry, who carried a questionable game status before the bye due to a knee injury, played a season-low 31 defensive snaps on the way to reaching 7.5 sacks. The veteran outside linebacker was back as a limited participant on Wednesday. And across the line of scrimmage, Lowe was also available in that capacity for the Patriots due to an abdomen issue.

The Ravens (6-7) are getting ready for a critical game in Cincinnati. While they still control their own destiny and win the AFC North if they reach the playoffs, they're one game behind the Pittsburgh Steelers with four weeks left.

Repeated concussions − and even repeated sub-concussive blows that never make a highlight reel − cause lasting neurological damage.
The Boston University CTE Center has studied 376 former NFL players’ brains and found CTE in 345 of them.
Yet every part of the Higgins story − the immediate clearance, the delayed symptoms, the next-day diagnosis − shows how fragile the truth actually is.
The league’s concussion protocol failed exactly the way the science says it will.","On Sunday, the Cincinnati Bengals faced the Buffalo Bills, and everyone saw the same terrifying sequence. Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins twisted mid-air to make a spectacular catch, only to come down with the full force of his body driving his head into the frozen turf.

He stayed down, left the field for evaluation, and − minutes later − was cleared to return under the NFL’s concussion protocol. Later, after another hard landing, he was checked again and finished the game. By Monday morning, he didn’t feel right and was placed back into the protocol.

The league's protocol was built to clear players, not protect them

This is not a mystery. It is the predictable failure of a protocol that pretends concussions can be diagnosed − or ruled out − in the heat of a game. The biology doesn’t work that way. Symptoms often appear hours later, exactly as they did with Higgins. His case isn’t an exception; it’s a textbook demonstration of why the current system cannot protect players. The protocol is designed to get them back on the field, not to recognize what is actually happening inside their skulls.

Meanwhile, football culture keeps cheering the very blows that cause these injuries.

Several weeks earlier, on Nov. 13, the Enquirer highlighted former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster describing his concussing hit on former Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict as a “legendary moment” in his career. In the rush to revisit a storied rivalry, the piece folded a traumatic brain injury into the sport’s “color,” as if harm were just part of the scenery. Burfict’s own history of reckless hits does not change the fact that on that play, he was the victim of a concussion − and the celebration of that moment reflects what we have come to accept.

A culture that turns brain trauma into spectacle

The science is not ambiguous. Repeated concussions − and even repeated sub-concussive blows that never make a highlight reel − cause lasting neurological damage. The Boston University CTE Center has studied 376 former NFL players’ brains and found CTE in 345 of them. Their brain bank now holds more than 1,700 donated specimens, with over 800 confirmed cases of CTE. This is one of the clearest cause-and-effect relationships in modern medicine: repetitive head impacts lead to degenerative brain disease.

What makes this a national tragedy is not only what happens on Sundays in the NFL. It’s what happens because of Sundays in the NFL. When professional football glamorizes big hits, delayed-onset concussions, and “legendary” knockouts, the message filters directly into youth sports − where the players’ brains are still developing and far more vulnerable. We are celebrating impacts that, in any other context, would send a child straight to the emergency room.

Football has built a culture that normalizes what we would never tolerate anywhere else. We pretend the violence is harmless because we enjoy the spectacle. Yet every part of the Higgins story − the immediate clearance, the delayed symptoms, the next-day diagnosis − shows how fragile the truth actually is.

The league’s concussion protocol failed exactly the way the science says it will. And as long as we treat brain trauma as entertainment instead of medical reality, more players − from NFL stars to children in school leagues − will bear the cost.

The 2026 quarterback transition tag projects to 12.604% of the salary cap (compared to 12.671% in 2025).","A dream season for the Indianapolis Colts has turned into a nightmare. At 7-1, they looked poised for a deep playoff run behind the NFL's best record and an explosive offense averaging a league-leading 33.8 points per game.

Quarterback Daniel Jones, signed to a one-year, $14 million deal worth up to $17.7 million, was enjoying a stunning career resurgence and emerging as an early MVP candidate. Through eight games, he threw for 2,062 yards with 13 touchdowns and two interceptions while completing 71.2% of his passes (173 of 243) for a 109.5 rating. He ranked third in completion percentage, fourth in passing yards and fifth in passer rating league-wide.

Believing Jones had finally stabilized a position that's been unsettled since Andrew Luck's abrupt 2019 retirement, the Colts went all in at the Nov. 4 trade deadline. They acquired All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner from the Jets in exchange for their 2026 and 2027 first-round picks and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell — a win-now move that signaled full commitment to the 2025 season.

But the unraveling began soon after. Jones' play dipped as a fracture in his left fibula sapped the mobility central to his game. Gardner is now out indefinitely with a left calf strain. And Jones' season ended in Week 14 when he tore his right Achilles early in a 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The quarterback room is now in disarray. Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 pick in 2023 who lost a preseason competition to Jones, remains on injured reserve with an orbital fracture suffered in a freak elastic-band accident before Week 6. Rookie sixth-round pick Riley Leonard is dealing with a PCL sprain in his right knee from the Jaguars game.

Out of desperation, Indianapolis signed 44-year-old Philip Rivers to the practice squad. Rivers last played in 2020 -- as the Colts' starting quarterback.

After losing four of five to fall to 8-5, Indianapolis is suddenly in danger of missing the postseason. The remaining schedule offers no relief: Seattle, San Francisco, Jacksonville and Houston -- a quartet with a combined .692 winning percentage -- all would be in the playoffs if the season ended today.

Philip Rivers explainer: Why is the 44-year-old QB making his NFL return by signing with the Colts?

Colts face limited alternatives at QB

Jones' injury puts his future with the Colts in jeopardy. Without first-round picks, it becomes far more difficult for Indianapolis to pivot to a new quarterback through the NFL Draft -- and there may not have been much appetite to go that route anyway after spending a top-five selection on Richardson. The 2026 quarterback class is considered mediocre at best.

There aren't great alternatives in free agency. Aaron Rodgers, now 42, was fairly certain 2025 would be his final NFL season when he signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers in June. Beyond Rodgers, the top options are Marcus Mariota (Commanders), Kenny Pickett (Raiders) and Tyrod Taylor (Jets). Joe Flacco, Gardner Minshew and Carson Wentz -- all of whom previously spent time with the Colts -- will also be available.

Mac Jones would be the best trade option. He kept the 49ers afloat during the eight games Brock Purdy missed with a turf toe injury and will be entering a contract year in 2026, when he's scheduled to make $4.66 million. With the modest salary and a shallow quarterback market, San Francisco should have leverage in any Jones trade talks.

Kyler Murray is another potential trade candidate, as his time in Arizona appears to be nearing an end. Acquiring him would effectively lock a team into a two-year, nearly $79 million commitment due to the structure of his deal. Murray's 2026 salary is $42,542,500, including $36.8 million fully guaranteed. Of the $36.335 million he's scheduled to earn in 2027, his unsecured $19.5 million base salary becomes fully guaranteed on March 15, the fifth day of the 2026 league year.

Jones' recovery outlook and 2026 future

The quarterback landscape sets up for Jones to return to Indianapolis for at least the 2026 season. Before the injury, his camp was likely to seek a deal exceeding the four-year, $160 million contract he signed with the New York Giants in 2023 -- particularly if the Colts planned to use the franchise tag. That contract averaged $40 million per year, included incentives and escalators pushing it to $195 million, and contained $104 million in guarantees, with $81 million fully guaranteed at signing.

A non-exclusive franchise tag in 2026, which was a realistic possibility prior to the injury, is projected to cost 14.576% of that year's salary cap (compared to 14.413% in 2025). If the 2026 cap lands at $300 million -- a 7.45% increase over 2025's $279.2 million -- the tag for quarterbacks should come in around $43.278 million.

The timeline for Jones' recovery remains unclear, though it isn't out of the question that he could be ready for the start of the 2026 regular season. There are recent examples of relatively fast returns from Achilles injuries. Cam Akers came back in just 5½ months after tearing his Achilles in 2021 and became the lead back for the Rams' Super Bowl LVI run. J.K. Dobbins considered himself fully recovered roughly eight months after his 2023 Achilles tear and opened the 2024 season with back-to-back 100-yard games before a separate MCL sprain slowed him, preventing him from having his first 1,000-yard season.

Quarterback recoveries provide an even closer comparison. Kirk Cousins tore his right Achilles in late October of the 2023 season, passed his training-camp physical the following July and opened the 2024 season as the Falcons' starter. Jones, who turns 29 in May, is nearly nine years younger than Cousins, so he could heal even more quickly.

Tyler Sullivan

Evaluating Jones' contract value after the injury

It wouldn't be surprising for Jones' camp to push for business as usual financially despite the injury. Before he went down, Jones was having the best season of his career. His 68.0% completion rate, 238.5 passing yards per game and 100.2 passer rating were all career highs.

Cousins is the closest recent contract comp. Less than five months after his own Achilles tear, Cousins received a four-year, $180 million deal (worth up to $188 million) with $100 million in guarantees -- $90 million of which was fully guaranteed at signing -- from the Falcons in 2024 free agency. The $45 million-per-year average made him the NFL's eighth-highest-paid player at the time.

Cousins, however, was far more accomplished, having posted seven 4,000-yard seasons. Jones has yet to reach 3,500 yards in a single year. The Cousins contract now serves as a cautionary tale: his mobility noticeably declined after the injury, and he was benched late in the 2024 season.

A structure similar to the one Drew Brees received when he joined the Saints in 2006 could appeal to Indianapolis if Jones remains viewed as a long-term solution. Because Brees entered free agency with a career-threatening shoulder injury, New Orleans protected itself with a market-rate multi-year deal with the ability to part ways after the first year with minimal salary cap consequences if he couldn't regain his previous form.

The Colts adopted a similar approach with Peyton Manning in 2011 following his neck surgery. As a franchise player, Manning signed a five-year, $90 million deal tying him with Tom Brady as the league's highest-paid player, but Indianapolis had the ability to part ways after one year. Manning missed the entire season, and the Colts moved on after paying him $26.4 million for that one year.

If Indianapolis and Jones' representatives fundamentally disagree on long-term value, Jones' camp might be open to a transition tag in 2026. Under the transition designation, Jones could negotiate with other teams when free agency begins on March 11, and the Colts would have five days to match any offer sheet. If they decline to match, there is no draft pick compensation.

The 2026 quarterback transition tag projects to 12.604% of the salary cap (compared to 12.671% in 2025). With a $300 million cap, that number is expected to be $37.813 million. Even so, Indianapolis may find that figure steep, though it aligns reasonably with the one-year, $25 million deal the team gave Rivers in 2020 when adjusted for cap inflation.

Given the financial risk and uncertainty surrounding Jones' recovery, a two-year contract may ultimately make the most sense. However, the two-year, $40 million deal with $30 million fully guaranteed that Justin Fields received from the Jets is unlikely to satisfy Jones' camp. It's difficult to reconcile that type of contract with the one-year, $28 million extension the Colts gave Jacoby Brissett in 2019, just weeks after Andrew Luck's retirement, despite Brissett being relatively unproven.

A more instructive comparison might be Blake Bortles' 2018 extension with the Jaguars. Bortles received a two-year deal averaging $17,473,500 per season, plus $11.5 million in incentives, when the cap was $177.2 million. The contract carried $26.5 million fully guaranteed. Adjusted for a 2026 salary cap environment, the base value of that deal would fall in the $30 million-per-year range.

A short-term contract at roughly $30 million annually would also align with the marketplace. According to NFLPA data, the average 2025 salary for starting quarterbacks — including those on rookie deals -- is $30,153,958. When rookie-scale quarterbacks are removed, that average jumps to $44,067,508 per year.

Uncertain factors that could shape Jones' future

There would also be a real risk of a quarterback-needy team making a run at Jones if he reaches the open market, injury or not. All bets could be off with a complete collapse where general manager Chris Ballard and/or head coach Shane Steichen lose their jobs.

Another variable is Jones' own financial outlook. Having already secured one major payday, he may be more willing to show some flexibility with Indianapolis. Jones earned $82 million in 2023 and 2024 from his Giants contract alone.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/10/9443cb41-842c-482f-99b6-6ca0db78b796/thumbnail/1200x675/1c2e23624cbbeff8b8359b389caaa021/jones-colts-getty.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 18:02:53.516476

,,2025-12-10 21:06:39+00:00,Detroit Free Press,Lions' Brian Branch has Achilles surgery. What's his return timeline? - Detroit Free Press,Dave Birkett,,,,,https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2025/12/10/brian-branch-injury-update-achilles/87703396007/,"Brian Branch recently underwent surgery to repair his torn Achilles tendon, and the expectation is he'll be back at some point in the 2026 season, Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell said.
""They’re always going to give you the whatever, 8 to 12 months or whatever that is, from the time of surgery.
If Branch follows a similar timeline, he could be back on the practice field sometime next September.

""He’s had it repaired and sounds like everything went well,"" Campbell said Wednesday, Dec. 10, in Allen Park. ""They’re always going to give you the whatever, 8 to 12 months or whatever that is, from the time of surgery. But the surgery went well. Everything went well.""

Branch tore the Achilles tendon in his right leg Dec. 4 trying to break up a pass in the end zone late in the Week 14 win over the Dallas Cowboys.

A second-round pick out of Alabama in 2023, Branch has been one of the Lions' most valuable and versatile defensive players for all three of his NFL seasons.

He ranked second on the team with nine pass breakups, was third with 75 tackles and had 2½ sacks, five tackles for loss and one forced fumble.

Branch was in line for a long-term contract extension before his injury, but now may have to wait until after he returns to the field in 2026.

Former Lions safety Tracy Walker tore his Achilles in Week 3 of the 2022 season and returned to play all 17 games in 2023 − his last season in the league. Walker was cleared to practice in June of that year and was a full participant in training camp, which begins in late July.

If Branch follows a similar timeline, he could be back on the practice field sometime next September.

Lions injury report in Week 15

Along with Branch, left tackle Taylor Decker (shoulder) and linebacker Alex Anzalone (illness) did not practice.

Wide receiver Kalif Raymond returned to practice after a two-game absence due to an ankle injury.

Kerby Joseph (knee), Kayode Awosika (foot), Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle), Thomas Harper (concussion) and Shane Zylstra (ankle/knee) also took part in the open portion of practice.

Zylstra returned to practice from injured reserve for one day last week, but was listed as a non-participant in the Lions' final practice of the week. Campbell said Zylstra did not suffer any setbacks, and could help the Lions' injury-depleted tight end room as soon as this Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Rams.

""It was kind of how we had it planned,"" Campbell said. ""He was out there at walk-through (today), we’re going to have him out at practice today and we’d love to have him at the game barring no setback. We’ll see where he goes here.""","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/05/PDTF/87617582007-20251204-detroit-lions-v-dallas-cowboys-fg-013.JPG?crop=2046,1153,x0,y171&width=2046&height=1153&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 17:02:13.468952

The hope is that Skattebo will be healthy enough to return for Giants training camp in July.","Cam Skattebo is finally putting one foot in front of the other.

On Wednesday morning, the Giants rookie running back posted a video on his Instagram story showing him walking into the team facility in East Rutherford, N.J. for the first time since suffering a season-ending ankle injury during a Week 8 loss to the Eagles.

“Man, walking into the facility on my own two feet,” Skattebo says in the video. “God is good, man. Just want to say thank you to everybody that supported me. We gettin’ back, let’s go. Gettin’ back to it, let’s go.”

The 23-year-old dislocated his right ankle while getting tackled from behind midway through the second quarter that made for a gruesome scene some of his Giants teammates had to turn away from. Skattebo was later carted off the field with his ankle in an air cast and received a standing ovation at Lincoln Financial Field.

Skattebo detailed more of the injury on YouTuber N3on’s show in November, saying he broke his fibula and “tore the ligament that goes from here [pointing to the top of his foot] to my ankle.”

“Since the bone broke, a full dislocation of the ankle. It was like 90 degrees,” he went on. “There’s a tendon that holds your two bones together at the ankle, that also tore. So they put, it’s called a tightrope, they put it inside. They drill a hole in your bones and they put it in there and it holds your bones together. But it’s really hard to do again — that won’t tear.”

Skattebo previously had his right foot in a boot and utilized a knee walker to get around.

However, the brutal injury hasn’t stopped Skattebo from being active while he is sidelined.

The Giants’ fourth-round pick out of Arizona State had a wild and controversial WWE appearance at MSG in November and sat courtside at the Garden for a Knicks game against the Jazz.

He also was recently out in the New York City Christmas scene with girlfriend Chloe Rodriguez.

Rodriguez posted a series of photos on Instagram on Tuesday. The first is one of her posing in Times Square followed by two of her getting cozy with Skattebo, including a photo of the couple in front of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree in Midtown.

“Thanks for keeping me warm,” Rodriguez wrote in the caption.

Rodriguez, who is a graduate of California State University in Sacramento, has been dating Skattebo since his college days at Arizona State. She was also by his side at the NFL draft this year.

Before his rookie season came to an end, Skattebo racked up 410 yards rushing on 101 carries for five touchdowns while also adding 207 yards receiving plus two touchdowns.

The hope is that Skattebo will be healthy enough to return for Giants training camp in July.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/newspress-collage-cilobk7qm-1765379512439.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1765361535&w=1200,N,,2025-12-10 18:03:15.824398

Roster management becomes slightly different in the postseason, with the primary focus centered on surviving and advancing. But at the same time, you want to make sure your flanks are covered so that a major injury doesn't completely derail your title chances.

For example, we recommended Blake Corum last week as our top pick. Although Kyren Williams is still the Rams' starting running back, Corum has been seeing more work lately. In Week 14, he rushed for 128 yards and two touchdowns on just 12 carries. Even so, Corum is still only rostered in one-third of Yahoo leagues.

Which players can help you on the road to a fantasy league championship? Let's take a look.

Fantasy football players to add for Week 15

Due to the wide variance in types of leagues and individual team needs, the players listed here include their availability rates in Yahoo leagues, which may or may not match rates on other platforms. Since the fantasy playoffs begin this week in most leagues, the bar for picking up players is considerably higher with fewer teams in the mix. Spend whatever you must to get the players you need.

RB Jaylen Wright and Ollie Gordon, Miami Dolphins (3%, 8% rostered)

The biggest health concern for fantasy managers last week came when the Dolphins' De'Von Achane exited early with a rib injury and didn't return. Taking over as the lead back, Wright logged 24 carries for 107 yards. He also scored a short-yardage touchdown, which came before Achane's injury. Gordon, a reliable backup all season, also got into the end zone − but he only saw five carries for 17 yards. Wright would be the top priority if Achane is limited going forward since he outsnapped Gordon 32-16 vs. the Jets. (Recommended FAAB bids: Wright 80%, Gordon 40%)

TE Harold Fannin Jr., Cleveland Browns (40% rostered)

If you need a tight end this week, Fannin is your guy. QB Shedeur Sanders seems to look his way constantly, and he responded on Sunday with a career-high eight catches for 144 yards. He also reached the end zone for the second week in a row. Veteran tight end David Njoku also scored, but he left the game with a knee injury on the play and didn't return. (FAAB bid: 65%)

RB Bam Knight and Michael Carter, Arizona Cardinals (38%, 6% rostered)

The ""... Trey Benson is coming back"" trope is wearing thin. If Benson is not activated off IR this week, he'll be ineligible to play the rest of the season. Knight has been the most productive back in Benson's absence, but the difference between him and Carter hasn't been that great lately − mostly because of the success QB Jacoby Brissett has enjoyed throwing the ball. This week's matchup against the Houston Texans is horrible, but Atlanta and Cincinnati await if you advance. (FAAB bids: Knight 30%, Carter 25%)

WR Ryan Flournoy, Dallas Cowboys (1% rostered)

With CeeDee Lamb exiting in the third quarter with concussion symptoms, Flournoy stepped forward on Thursday as Dak Prescott's top target against the Lions. He hauled in nine of his 13 targets for 115 yards and also scored a touchdown. Lamb will have an extra few days to recover and should be back against the Vikings, but Flournoy is still a great insurance policy with the Cowboys so reliant on their passing game. (FAAB bid: 25%)

WR Isaac TeSlaa, Detroit Lions (12% rostered)

Not going to say his performance has been electric, but the Lions have been quite innovative in getting the ball to their opportunistic rookie. TeSlaa hauled in yet another touchdown on Thursday night vs. Dallas, giving him a total of four on the season − on only eight receptions. He didn't see as much action as expected with star WR Amon-Ra St. Brown shaking off an ankle injury to play almost a full game. Even so, you could say TeSlaa is definitely a plug-and-play receiver should anything happen to St. Brown or Jameson Williams in this high-powered Lions offense. (FAAB bid: 25%)

WR Luther Burden III, Chicago Bears (17% rostered)

It can take time for some rookie wide receivers to find their niche. That could very well be the case for Burden, who led the Bears with six targets and 67 yards on Sunday. His production, however, has been steady, if unspectacular. If you feel comfortable betting on upside, he's shown more lately than either Rome Odunze or D.J. Moore. (FAAB bid: 20%)

WR Rashid Shaheed, Seattle Seahawks (52% rostered)

Shaheed is little above the standard 50% threshold we use for waiver wire eligibility, but we'll include him for shallow-league purposes. On Sunday, he scored his first touchdown since being acquired by the Seahawks, but it came on a kickoff return, not a pass from QB San Darnold. There's always a possibility he can take another return to the house, but what was even more encouraging was his involvement in the offense. Shaheed caught four of five targets for 67 yards at Atlanta, by far his best effort with his new club. (FAAB bid: 20%)

WR Marvin Mims, Denver Broncos (13% rostered)

Mims also performs double duty as a kick returner and he took a punt back for a score on Sunday against the Raiders. However, he seems to be a bit further down the Broncos' pecking order as a wideout than Shaheed is in Seattle. He hasn't seen more than two targets since Week 7, having been passed on the depth chart by rookie Pat Bryant (3% rostered). (FAAB bid: 10%)

TE Dalton Schultz, Houston Texans (47% rostered)

A secondary tight end addition for the playoff run, Schultz didn't do much on the stat sheet Sunday night. But a three-catch, 22-yard performance could have been much better if his red-zone touchdown reception wasn't nullified by a penalty. Before that, Schultz had surpassed 50 receiving yards in six of his previous eight games. A matchup vs. the Cardinals this week should be more to his liking. (FAAB bid: 10%)

Quarterbacks to stream in Week 15

Let's face it, you're in pretty big trouble if you're getting your starting quarterback in a playoff game off the waiver wire. But injuries do happen and we saw Daniel Jones, Jayden Daniels and Geno Smith exit early this past Sunday.

QB Tyler Shough, New Orleans Saints (8% rostered)

He only had 144 passing yards on Sunday vs. Tampa Bay, but he did score a pair of rushing touchdowns. He faces the Panthers and Jets at home, then is at Tennessee in Week 17.

QB J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings (30% rostered)

Finally, McCarthy put up a decent game with three TD passes, albeit against a terrible opponent. However, that will be the case for each of the next three weeks as he goes up against the Cowboys, Giants and Colts − all ranked in the bottom-7 in fantasy points allowed to quarterbacks.

QB C.J. Stroud, Houston Texans (42% rostered)

Stroud had a nice first half and a dismal second half in Kansas City. But like McCarthy with Justin Jefferson, he has a top-tier wideout in Nico Collins, who can make plays all over the field. He has decent home matchups vs. the Cardinals and Raiders before a dangerous road date at the Chargers on championship week.

QB Philip Rivers, Indianapolis Colts (0% rostered)

Yeah, I remember how it went when I was 44 and tried some strenous physical activity I hadn't done in five years ....","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/09/USAT/87688314007-jaylen-wright.jpg?crop=4606,2591,x64,y24&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 17:02:23.206723

Dowman, 15, suffered the injury following a challenge by an opponent during a friendly against Manchester United on Saturday. He is not expected to require surgery.

Arsenal confirmed on Tuesday that the England youth international had been taken out of their Champions League squad following an ankle injury, with Gabriel Jesus added in his place.

Newly-amended UEFA rules state that outfield players can be replaced in the European competition’s squads in the event of a “long-term” injury with an absence of at least 60 days.

Asked about Dowman during Tuesday’s pre-match press conference before Arsenal’s Champions League tie against Club Brugge, Mikel Arteta said: “With Max, unfortunately, he picked up an injury last weekend, and he had to come off, so we did some scans and he is going to be out for weeks.”

After impressing in pre-season Dowman made his first-team debut for Arsenal in the 5-0 victory over Leeds United in August, becoming the second-youngest player to appear for the north London side, behind team-mate Ethan Nwaneri.

In November, he became the youngest player in Champions League history after coming on as a substitute in Arsenal’s 3-0 victory over Slavia Prague, aged 15 years and 308 days.

Dowman has made five senior appearances across all competitions for Arsenal this season, providing one assist.

It was confirmed in October the club had reached an agreement with the midfielder to sign scholarship terms, with a professional contract expected to follow when he turns 17.

Arsenal have contended with a number of injury absentees during the 2025-26 campaign, with Cristhian Mosquera, Kai Havertz, Gabriel, Leandro Trossard and William Saliba currently sidelined.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/10032458/GettyImages-2248698509-scaled-e1765355213821.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-10 16:02:32.476808

In that span, while Mayfield has endured knee, oblique and shoulder injuries, he's completed only 54.3% of his passes for 530 yards, four TDs and four INTs – after throwing only two picks in the nine prior games. Rookie wideout Emeka Egbuka has had some painful drops in recent games, leading to the passing-game limitations, and the offensive line remains in tough shape. Guard Ben Bredeson left Week 14 with injury and is on IR, weakening the interior offensive line. The Bucs could also be without tight end Cade Otton, but they might welcome back Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan. Both receivers have been limited in practice this week, and are questionable for Thursday. The Bucs could save them for the showdown at Carolina in Week 16, however, they also need the firepower badly with every game critical. Tampa Bay's offense has scored 59 points (while allowing 98) in the past 14 quarters, dating back to the Bills loss. They must find answers fast. Atlanta's defense has fallen hard in recent games, but rookie pass rusher James Pearce Jr. is still causing havoc up front.

With Drake London (knee) ruled out, the Falcons remain perilously short of big-play weapons. Even tight end Kyle Pitts is dealing with a knee injury, limited in practice this week and officially questionable, but the Falcons had better hope plays on Thursday. In the three games London has missed, Pitts has a team-high 15 receptions and 197 yards; no other Falcon has more than nine catches or 96 receiving yards since then. Pitts, 25, will be an intriguing free agent this coming offseason, and he's moving around as well as he has in a few years. He's still not a TD producer (only two scores in his past 22 games), but Pitts can stretch the seam and be a consistent chain mover. Cousins has looked to Pitts more (26 targets) in his four starts than any other pass catcher and almost certainly needs his tight end healthy and available Thursday if the Falcons harbor any hopes of playing spoiler against a desperate Bucs team. Tampa Bay's defense has kept most tight ends in check this season, although Arizona's Trey McBride stung them for eight catches, 82 yards and a TD in Week 13. Pitts also had seven catches (and five first downs) on eight targets against the Bucs back in Week 1, when Penix was at QB.

Tampa Bay is in rough shape defensively. They've seen slightly better results on that side of the ball the past two weeks, but they also lost Tykee Smith and Haason Reddick to injury Sunday, prompting the signing of 36-year-old Jason Pierre-Paul (who hasn't played since 2023) this week. Several other Bucs defenders are nursing injuries, including linebacker SirVocea Dennis and DBs Christian Izien, Benjamin Morrison and Rashad Wisdom, potentially leaving them thin on all three levels of the unit. The Falcons offense is also in bad physical shape now, but they still pose issues with star running back Bijan Robinson and a fruitful run game. It also hasn't helped that the kick-coverage units have consistently given opponents quality field position in recent games. What helps is that Kirk Cousins is by no means a scrambler. Sunday's loss to the Saints highlighted Tampa's Bay's issues with handling mobile quarterbacks as they allowed their fifth and sixth rushing TDs by opposing quarterbacks. So perhaps without that threat, the Bucs can find ways to rush the passer more effectively and key in on stopping Robinson. Otherwise, they might be on the outside looking in prior to the weekend's games being played.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/l7cdyvi9jmhmiemahzjr,N,,2025-12-10 18:03:21.088680

They’re at DEFCON: Sign a 44-year-old Granddad in Indy.

Bringing in Philip Rivers underscores the desperation the Colts are experiencing after Daniel Jones’ season-ending Achilles injury. A QB room that was a question entering the season appeared to be stabilized by Jones. Now it’s more chaotic than a four-year-old’s bedroom after a playdate. Anthony Richardson remains on injured reserve. Rookie Riley Leonard is dealing with a PCL sprain. Clearly, Indy doesn’t trust practice-squad QB Brett Rypien much.

Rivers hasn’t thrown an NFL pass since Jan. 9, 2021, when the Colts lost to Buffalo in the Wild Card Round. That was the last time they made the postseason. Perhaps the football gods have a sense of humor.

The Colts were off to a 7-1 start, with Jones playing superbly. They looked poised to coast into the postseason. The deadline deal for Sauce Gardner was supposed to be the move that put them over the top. Now, Gardner is hurt, Jones is done for the year, and Indy is spiraling.

Losing four of their last five games, the Colts have fallen from the No. 1 seed in the AFC in Week 10 to out of playoff position. Sometimes, four weeks is all it takes to flip the script in the NFL. They have four more to write. Shane Steichen’s club has a 32% chance to make the postseason, per Next Gen Stats, with a measly 6% shot to recapture the division. A win Sunday boosts their odds to 58%, while a loss pushes them to 27%. The 31 percentage-point swing is the highest of any AFC team in Week 15.

They get no reprieve down the stretch. Sunday, they face 10-3 Seattle on the road, then host 9-4 San Francisco, 9-4 Jacksonville and head to 8-5 Houston for the finale. If Indy can’t find a way to best a very good Mike Macdonald defense in Week 15, Rivers’ comeback will be a footnote that does nothing more than push off his Hall of Fame candidacy for five years.

Week 15 opponent: vs. Chargers

Welp, scratch off almost everything I wrote last week. Swing and a miss.

The Chiefs lost the first game of their five-game sprint to the end of the season, with Andy Reid’s offense unable to puncture the Houston defense. Setting aside the controversial fourth-down decisions, the issues that have plagued the team all season were on full display. Patrick Mahomes couldn’t connect on splash plays. The run game offered no reprieve outside of 2-yard dives by Kareem Hunt in short-yardage situations. And the pass-catchers can’t stop dropping balls. Travis Kelce looks like a man seeing the end of the road right in front of him.

The loss to Houston dropped the Chiefs' playoff chances to 10%, per NGS. Their streak of AFC West titles has already been snapped at nine, with their lone shot at extending their playoff streak running through the wild card (1% chance at No. 6 seed; 10% chance at No. 7 seed).

The room for error now is zero. A Week 15 loss would officially eliminate the Chiefs from playoff contention. Even with a win, their odds only increase to 16%. Kansas City needs to win out, and it needs help from others.

On Sunday the Chiefs face a Chargers team that bested the Eagles in overtime on Monday night, with Justin Herbert gritting through a broken left hand. Kansas City lost the season opener to Los Angeles in Brazil, a game that feels like it happened eons ago. Since then, the reigning AFC champions have stumbled in close games, and outside of a three-game win streak in October, haven’t been able to keep their heads above water.

Losers of four of their last five, the Chiefs are on the brink. A win would keep their hopes alive for another week.

Week 15 opponent: vs. Raiders

This again. Philly fans are reliving the cyclical nightmare of following up an NFC Championship with a combustible campaign. The 2025 season is following an eerily similar path to the 2023 implosion, highlighted by a rocky offense and embattled coordinator.

Kevin Patullo’s offense can’t decide what it wants to be, with head-scratching play-calling weekly and an inability to consistently move the chains. He leans on Saquon Barkley for a spell before oddly going away from the reigning Offensive Player of the Year just as he begins to find traction. The Jalen Hurts-led passing attack almost exclusively lives on low-percentage outside throws, in an offense that lacks easy answers for the QB. Before Week 14’s turnover parade, at least we could say Hurts had been taking care of the ball.

The offensive line injuries are a massive issue and underscore that the unit has always been the backbone of the squad.

If it weren’t for Vic Fangio’s defense, the team would already be making Cancun plans.

As in 2023, when Philly got off to a 10-1 start before stumbling down the stretch to finish 11-6 and meekly bowed out of the postseason, the Eagles have been wobbly following their bye. They are 2-3 since the Week 9 break, averaging 16.2 points per game during that stretch.

Luckily for Nick Sirianni’s crew, the Cowboys’ own stumbles have kept the Eagles’ breathing room intact. Philly still has a 91% chance to win the NFC East, per NGS. With games against Las Vegas (2-11), Washington (3-10), Buffalo (9-4) and Washington again, the Eagles control their own destiny.

After their ugly three-game skid, Sunday’s game against Vegas is a must-win, not only to keep Dallas at bay, but to prevent the locals from revolting. Sirianni’s club needs to trounce a two-win opponent to get some mojo back.

Week 15 opponent: at Bengals

There are rollercoasters, then there is whatever the heck the Ravens are riding this season. A 1-5 start, in which the defense couldn’t stop a runny nose, was buttressed by a five-game win streak in which they didn’t allow 20 points. Then, with the division lead in their grasp, they kerplunked back-to-back AFC North home games.

The defensive ebbs and flows have partially stemmed from an inability to consistently get after the passer. Baltimore ranks 30th with 19 sacks this season. Rookie Mike Green leads the team with 2.5 sacks. The inability to push a QB off his spot reared its head in Week 14, when they allowed Aaron Rodgers to turn back the clock and divebomb them for splash plays. Giving life to an offense that had been DOA for much of the season is a bad sign.

While the defense has been a concern, the more pressing issue at this stage is that the offense looks little like what we expect from a Lamar Jackson-led unit. Baltimore has been a turnover machine with six giveaways the past two weeks, including five in Week 13 and a game-changing INT on Sunday.

Jackson hasn’t been nearly as dynamic as in past seasons. He’s generated a single game with 250-plus yards passing (288 in Week 3) and one game with 50-plus yards rushing (Week 1, 70 yards). The hamstring injury, which wiped out three-plus games, has clearly played a role in his reduced explosiveness running the ball, but Jackson hasn’t looked comfortable as a runner or thrower this season.

The Ravens' running game comes and goes. They piled up 217 rushing yards against the Steelers, but they couldn’t push forward in crucial short-yardage situations.

The offensive inconsistency has mirrored the Ravens' tumultuous season. Baltimore has a 40.6% play success rate, per NGS. For comparison, that’s 0.1% higher than the 3-win Saints, who have started Spencer Rattler and rookie Tyler Shough at quarterback. The red zone has been a particular issue. They rank near the bottom of the league in red-zone success rate this season at 32.9%. During their two-game skid, that success rate fell to 21.4%. Baltimore must find a way to reach paydirt more efficiently down the stretch to keep its season alive.

It starts with Sunday’s rematch against Cincy. On Thanksgiving night, the Ravens moved the ball but turned it over five times, allowing the Bengals to run away with the game. If Jackson can’t protect the ball and beat a pillow-soft defense, Baltimore has no shot at resurrecting the season. The Ravens finish up with the 11-2 Patriots, 9-3-1 Packers and a rematch with division-leading Pittsburgh. If they don’t win on Sunday, that Week 18 rivalry matchup could end up being meaningless.

Week 15 opponent: vs. Browns

There are games with more at stake when it comes to making the playoffs, and a loss doesn’t doom Ben Johnson’s club. However, Sunday’s game against a 3-win Browns team is pivotal to preventing the defeats from spiraling. Coming off a loss in Green Bay, it’s not a true trap game for the Bears, but they can’t afford to look ahead to the Week 16 Packers rematch before handling their business.

After falling from the NFC’s No. 1 seed to No. 7, Chicago currently has a 65% playoff probability, per NGS. That figure falls to 47% with a loss, while a win boosts it to 72%.

The Browns are a bottom-five team that just lost at home to the previously 1-win Titans. Yet, the defense, led by Myles Garrett, can wreck games. Rookie Shedeur Sanders has brought more spice to the offense. Cleveland already beat the Packers earlier this year after Green Bay bungled multiple chances to close the game. That should serve as a lesson for Johnson’s crew.

Contending teams regularly blast unworthy opponents. Can Johnson’s club stamp the Browns, or will it come down to the wire, as it has with other doormats, like the one-point wins over Vegas and Washington, and a 4-pointer at home against the Giants?

Caleb Williams has done a masterful job this season when it comes to avoiding the back-breaking plays and he’s made splashing jaw-droppers when needed. Johnson’s ground game has come on strong in recent weeks, and after watching the Titans scamper all over Jim Schwartz's defense last week, he should dial it up another notch. The Bears' defense gives up yards, but feasts on turnovers, generating a league-high 27, including 11 in the past six weeks. They should have a shot to generate a few more against Sanders on Sunday. On paper, a 9-win team should run away with this game. The Bears need to make it so.

In Johnson’s first season, the Bears have avoided -- sometimes miraculously -- the complete clunker against bad teams. They need to prevent the first from happening on Sunday at Soldier Field.

On deck are games against the Packers, 49ers and Lions. A loss to Cleveland, and the Bears would be staring at a slew of virtual must-wins to avoid a ruinous ending to an otherwise positive first season under Johnson.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/m33bnmuopxafjmerl5ge,N,,2025-12-10 16:02:40.174481

Uncertainty surrounding NFL rumors about J.J. McCarthy has Minnesota facing some uncomfortable quarterback questions, and Daniel Jones keeps popping up in the rumor mill as a possible safety net.

With McCarthy concussed, struggling, and Max Brosmer set for his first NFL start, this season is already starting to feel like an extended audition for everyone in the room rather than a real playoff push.

Over at ESPN, Dan Graziano outlined how Jones’ Achilles tear could reshape the landscape, starting with the team that already has him. One scenario he has heard from league sources is Jones simply re-signing with the Colts on a short deal, rehabbing in-house with coaches who know he can run their system and stepping back in once cleared.

That could be another one-year contract or a two-year, incentive-heavy structure that only really pays out if he gets all the way back. Another theory is a return to Minnesota, where Jones finished last season as Sam Darnold’s backup.

The Vikings staff already liked him then, but could not promise a starting job, and bringing him back as a rehab project and competition for McCarthy would fit that template. What almost everyone agrees on, per Graziano, is that talk of a big, long-term extension moves to the back burner after another season-ending injury.

He even heard that a franchise or transition tag in 2026, projected between roughly $39 million and $46 million, is “not off the table,” with both sides likely needing a creative deal that gives Jones more than a one-year rental, given how late the Achilles tear occurred.

Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer has framed the same dilemma in starker terms, pointing out that tagging Jones at that level would effectively triple his current salary and hand him leverage for a $50 million-per-year type contract if he rebounds.

For the Vikings, all of this means any Jones reunion would almost certainly come with caveats. If he ever hits the market, Minnesota makes sense as a suitor that already knows him and badly needs a competent veteran to push McCarthy.

But given how thin this free-agent quarterback class is and how highly the Colts still regard Jones, the more realistic outcome is that his rehab and future are decided in Indianapolis, while the Vikings weigh whether to follow that same “veteran challenger” blueprint with someone else.

After a concussion, athletes are typically told to avoid physical and mental activity until all of their symptoms go away.
In several published articles, researchers in the Sports Concussion Clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital have shown there is little value in complete mental and physical rest following a concussion.
Similarly, patients who exercised after a concussion improved faster than the ones who stopped all physical activity.
That research — along with studies from other groups — led directly to the change in concussion recovery recommendations now practiced around the country.","Concern has been growing in medical, football, and other sports communities that repeated concussions may lead to chronic neurologic health problems such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) later in life. Yet, there is a pressing need for data to help better understand the risk, incidence, progression, and treatment of repeated head trauma.

The NFL has awarded Boston Children’s Hospital a $14.7 million grant to conduct neurological health assessments of up to 2,500 former NFL players. The goal is to better understand long-term neurologic health consequences of concussions and sub-concussive injuries. The research team will be led by William Meehan, MD, of Boston Children’s Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Center, in collaboration with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the Medical College of Wisconsin, and University Orthopedics and Sports Medicine Department in State College, Pa.

The five-year study aims to determine the long-term neurological impact of concussions and repeated brain trauma. Combined with results of a survey conducted in 2001, the project will give a prospective view of health outcomes over a 20-year span. Researchers will also test four potential therapies for the neurological effects of repeated brain trauma. The study is part of a continued effort to improve player safety and quality of life for athletes of all ages, whether the athlete is a national-level player or high school athlete.

After a concussion, athletes are typically told to avoid physical and mental activity until all of their symptoms go away. In several published articles, researchers in the Sports Concussion Clinic at Boston Children’s Hospital have shown there is little value in complete mental and physical rest following a concussion. Based on a series of studies of athletes with concussions, they found that mild or moderate mental activities appeared to have little impact on the time of recovery. High levels of mental activity did appear to delay recovery.

Similarly, patients who exercised after a concussion improved faster than the ones who stopped all physical activity. This was particularly true for adolescent athletes between the ages 14 and 18.

Every week, we’ll select the most notable observations and back them up with the objective data we’ve become known for.

Here are our top observations for 2025 NFL Week 14.

Week 14 Data Charter Observations

1. “Amon-Ra St. Brown is an absolute DOG. Looking like he had no shot to play leading up to the game, he gutted out a great performance. It seemed the Lions intentionally threw him the ball on their first play to set the tone that they were there to save their season by any means necessary. Then, with the game on the line, the Lions dialed up a perfect play-action pass to St. Brown, who put an exclamation point on the night with a 30+ yard catch. He embodies the grit that the Lions are all about.”

Week 14 kicked off with the Lions needing a win and finding a way to emerge victorious in a 44-30 shootout win over the Cowboys on Thursday Night Football. With one of their leaders looking very questionable to suit up, WR Amon-Ra St. Brown gutted out a great performance with 6 catches for 92 yards, including a 37-yard catch and run with the Lions looking to put the game out of reach. St. Brown ended up playing 91.2% of the snaps while picking up 53 yards after the catch, which displayed his toughness, playing through the ankle injury.

It helps to have a real-life video game player in RB Jahmyr Gibbs to rely on for consistent offense when your season is on the line. Gibbs totaled 120 yards on 19 touches while scoring his 47th touchdown in just his 45th career game with 3 rushing touchdowns against the Cowboys. He makes plays every week that other RBs in the league cannot match. The road to the playoffs does not get any easier with a road matchup against the Rams on tap for the Lions next week.

2. “I understand that the Chiefs won two Super Bowls and went back to another without Tyreek Hill, but it’s apparent with this team that their offense is nowhere near the capability it was with Hill on the team. They have tried to bring in several players over the past couple of years to fill that void, but none have come close to the explosiveness Hill brought. That doesn’t mean this team is completely broken, but they’re now a team that is reliant on long, methodical drives that keep them from being a team that routinely scores 30+ points a game to a team that ends up in the 20s far too often. That in turn leads them to playing closer games, and when you play so many one-score games like this team has over the past three seasons, you are bound to have breaks go against you. That’s what you’re seeing with the Chiefs this season. They’re still a great team, but you can only rely on winning close games for so long before the ball starts to bounce the other way, which leads them to the record they have now.”

The Chiefs’ playoff hopes took a major hit following a 20-10 loss to the Texans, marking their fourth loss in the last five games. The Chiefs have seen no shortage of good teams over the past five games, and the Texans’ #1 defense was too much for the Chiefs to overcome. QB Patrick Mahomes was harassed all gam,e leading to just 14 completions on 33 attempts for 160 yards, 0 touchdowns, and 3 interceptions. Among 33 QBs with at least 20 deep pass attempts this season, Mahomes ranks 21st in completion percentage (35.2%), which has led to the 7th most yards (693), but just 1 touchdown and 3 interceptions. In turn, the Chiefs are reliant on yards after the catch, ranking second in that category (1,876), meaning they need to sustain long drives to score points.

Another issue is the lack of production from their RBs. Mahomes led the Chiefs with 59 rushing yards on 7 attempts while RBs Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco combined for 60 yards on 21 attempts. For the season, the Chiefs rank tied for 27th in explosive run rate at just 3.1%. The Chiefs streak of difficult opponents continues next week with a home matchup against the Chargers in Week 15.

3. “It’s good to see Travis Etienne producing the way he has been all season. He is maybe lacking a little bit of explosiveness, but he looks like a true veteran running back in the sense that he has a great feel for how to set up blocks and hit holes with precision. I’d like to see him more in the passing game to see if he can dial it back to his days at Clemson, where he was a menace in the open field. Nevertheless, Liam Coen exploits Etienne’s experience in the run game to make him one of the pleasant surprise RBs in 2025.”

The Jaguars seized control in the AFC South with a 36-19 win over the Colts at home in Week 14. RB Travis Etienne carried the ball 20 times for 74 yards and 2 touchdowns, leaving Etienne as the RB10 in rushing yards this season with 917. Among RBs with 100+ carries on the season, Etienne ranks 22nd in explosive run rate at 4.0%, but he does own a healthy 2.50 YBCO/ATT average, showing good blocking and ability to set up those blocks. One area that has been a bit limiting for him this season is in the passing game, where his route share sits at 37.1%, leading to 26 catches on the season (25th among RBs).

WR Jakobi Meyers continued to be a good mid-season acquisition for the Jaguars with 4 catches, 39 yards, and 1 touchdown against the Colts. Although his receiving total was down this week, Meyers leads the Jaguars with 30 targets, 22 catches, 284 receiving yards, and 3 touchdowns since they traded for him prior to Week 10. Up next is a good spot for Etienne and the running game as they take on the Jets, who have given up 1,813 rushing yards this season (3rd most).

4. “This might have been the best quarterbacked game I've watched this year, as both Joe Burrow and Josh Allen consistently put the ball in tight windows and created plays with their legs. Back-to-back INTs of passes batted at the line muddied Burrow's numbers and hurt the Bengals already slim playoff chances, but this game was evidence that they still could've been in the mix had he been healthy all year.”

The showdown between Josh Allen and Joe Burrow lived up to the hype with the Bills pulling out a thrilling 39-34 win over the Bengals. As is the case with most high-profile Bills games this season, Josh Allen put on the Superman cape and threw for 251 yards on 22 of 28 passing for 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions to go along with 78 yards and another touchdown on the ground. Allen was dialed in throwing the ball, registering a 5.7% CPOE, 84.6% ADJ COMP, 75.0% ACC, 89.3% CATCH, and 0.0% TWT. It might have been Allen’s best game as a passer all season, which will need to continue next week in a pivotal AFC East matchup with the Patriots.

On the other side, Joe Burrow nearly pulled off an upset with 284 passing yards and 4 touchdowns, but 2 costly interceptions were too much to overcome. Burrow was a little less accurate than Allen on the day, but did show off his willingness to give his pass catchers a chance for a big play with an 11.1% hero throw rate. His undoing came in the fourth quarter on a screen pass that was intercepted and returned for a touchdown, followed by another interception on the Bengals’ very next offensive play. The Bengals’ last hopes of making the playoffs rest on a home game against the Ravens in Week 14.

5. “Jerry Jeudy was wide open down the field two times in a short span before getting hit on a crosser that he took 60 yards to the house. The Browns looked like they were able to threaten more down the field and to the boundaries, creating tons of YAC room later in the game on passes to the flats and across the middle of the field.”

Despite taking a loss by a final of 31-29 at the hands of the Titans, the Browns found their first 300-yard passing game from a QB in over a full calendar year. QB Shedeur Sanders threw for 364 passing yards, 3 touchdowns, and 1 interception on 23 of 42 passing while adding 29 yards and 1 touchdown on 3 rushing attempts. Last week, we talked about Sanders giving the Browns their best hope at running a traditional offense, and he delivered against the Titans. Sanders averaged a decent aDOT of 8.1 and was able to give his playmakers a chance to pick up yards after the catch as 74.2% of Sanders’ yards were after the catch. Still plenty of room for improvement as Sanders held onto the ball too long by averaging 3.43 TTT and throwing to his first read on just 42.9%. Overall, it was a good performance from Sanders, which at least gives him something to build on next week as the Browns travel to Chicago to take on the Bears.

6. “On one hand, I feel for Justin Herbert because he is constantly under fire and trying his best to make a play. On the other hand, he needs to do a better job of getting rid of the ball. The Chargers’ shortcomings on the offensive line are well known, yet Herbert has a tendency to stand in the pocket waiting for receivers to uncover. He possesses some of the best athletic ability of any QB in the league with his arm strength and running ability, but I’d like to see the Chargers dial up more quick hitters to relieve the pressure that Herbert sees play-in and play-out. The pass rush can’t get home if the QB doesn’t have the ball in his hands.”

Week 14 came to an end with the Chargers outlasting the Eagles in a hard-fought 22-19 win in overtime. With the Chargers’ defense coming up with 4 interceptions on the night, they were able to overcome a sluggish performance on offense. QB Justin Herbert had surgery less than a week ago, but was able to grind out 139 passing yards, 1 touchdown, and 1 interception to go along with 66 rushing yards on 10 carries. With multiple offensive linemen out, Herbert was under pressure on a league-high 68.3% of his dropbacks, but he averaged the 5th-longest TTT (3.10). For the season, Herbert’s time to pressure is the second fastest at 2.41, and his time to throw is the ninth fastest at 2.56. The discrepancy between his TTP and TTT is the 4th-widest discrepancy in the NFL, which is a recipe for disaster because the Chargers are struggling in pass protection, but Herbert is also holding onto the ball too long. The Chargers have overcome their pass protection woes to sit at 9-4, but they play a difficult schedule to finish the season starting with a road game against the Chiefs next week.

Bonus Observations

Bucs WR Emeka Egbuka —The Bucs utilized a ton of screens and weren't able to take many shots down the field and couldn't execute when they attempted them. Emeka Egbuka couldn't come down with a deep shot late that would've been a TD after a beautiful route. Egbuka has hit a rookie wall, failing to cross 50 receiving yards in five out of his last six games while owning a 40.4% catch rate in that span.

Saints QB Tyler Shough —Shough looked like a potential starter in this league. The game was played under terrible conditions, so it’s hard to get a true read on him as a passer. That said, his running ability looked awesome and something that he can lean into as he progresses as a starter. He also makes some throws that you can see him becoming a viable QB for the Saints and for fantasy teams. Shough posted 144 passing yards, 0 touchdowns, and 1 interception, but his running ability was excellent with 7 carries for 55 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns against the Bucs.

Packers WR Christian Watson —Watson is ballin’ since coming back from injury. Of course, injuries have always been his biggest downfall since he popped up on the injury report nearly every week in his first few seasons. That said, he is clearly a huge difference maker for the Packers. Watson caught 4 passes for 89 yards and 2 touchdowns en route to his fifth touchdown in his last 4 games. He also registered his highest snap share of the season at 84.6%.

Vikings QB JJ McCarthy —I think the early results from JJ McCarthy’s earlier starts were partially harmed due to some bad luck and this game may have swung the opposite way due to a bad Commanders defense. McCarthy looked comfortable in the pocket and moved around to create throwing lanes, showing complete command of the offense. McCarthy completed 16 of 23 passes for 163 passing yards and 3 touchdowns, marking his first game this season without a turnover.",https://static.fantasypts.com/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-10 15:03:19.255485

Shilo Sanders, who is out of football, is now pursuing music, acting, and brand deals.

Shedeur and Shilo Sanders have gotten to the bottom of one of the biggest mysteries this week in the NFL.

Was Shedeur, the Cleveland Browns starting quarterback, wearing a thong under his uniform during a 31-29 loss against the Tennessee Titans on Dec. 7?

It kind of looked like it, according to a screen shot after one play. Shilo, his older brother, conducted a not-so-serious investigation about it and then posted the findings on YouTube.

“Let’s cut to the business, bro,” Shilo said to Shedeur by phone. “Did you wear a thong or not?”

“Come on bro,” Shedeur replied.

“What’s going on with you, bro?” Shilo persisted.

“You forget I have a back injury, right?” Shedeur said. “So I get my back taped. So it is crazy that I did look like that… That is funny, though.”

Shedeur suffered a fractured back during the 2023 season at Colorado. Shilo and Shedeur are sons and former players of Colorado head coach Deion Sanders.

What is Shilo Sanders doing now?

Shilo is out of football after being waived by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before the season. In the video, he said he is moving from Tampa to Miami, where he said he is looking for a chef to cook for him and has been working on a rap album. He also said he was considering acting classes and has been doing YouTube videos and brand deals.

Shilo filed for bankruptcy in 2023 in a case that remains pending. In general, he is entitled to earnings he made after the filing.

“In the future, I definitely want to build that up – the music and the acting, the modeling, all that,” he said.

Shilo modeled with his brother in Paris in January 2024.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/10/USAT/87693218007-usatsi-27767528.jpg?crop=3979,2238,x78,y37&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 14:02:52.685866

Most of the favorites stayed in similar positions after wins. Only the AFC South registered a lot of movement between its three contenders, with one taking a nosedive and two slashing their odds in half to climb up the board.

Losses by two season-long title contenders also shook things up, with the Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs also rapidly falling.

With only four weeks left in the regular season, there are still plenty of interesting Super Bowl contenders. But as we saw after Week 14, additional contenders could start to fall off with injuries or bad losses.

Favorites mostly stay the same

There was minimal movement among the top seven Super Bowl contenders after Week 14. Staying on top, the Los Angeles Rams (+400) moved up slightly from +450 odds after an easy win in Arizona. Returning to peak form, QB Matthew Stafford regained the lead in the odds to win MVP after 281 passing yards and three TDs against the Cardinals.

The Seattle Seahawks (+750) and Green Bay Packers (+800) remain in the two spots after the Rams. Dominant defense and a big second half lifted Seattle past Atlanta, and Green Bay held off Chicago to take control of the NFC North with a win at Lambeau Field.

Three teams from the AFC continued a slow climb. The Buffalo Bills (+850) lead the pack, followed closely by the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots (+1000). That trio surpassed the Philadelphia Eagles (+1100) — who dipped from a tie for third and +900 odds following a Monday night loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.

Despite three straight losses, the Eagles maintain the NFC East lead. And with three of their four remaining matchups against teams competing for the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft, Philadelphia remains in a good position to secure a playoff spot.

Big games ahead

New England hosts Buffalo after the Patriots won the first matchup in Week 5 on the road. Denver welcomes Green Bay to begin a difficult four-week stretch to close the season. Detroit will try to play its way back into playoff contention in Los Angeles against the Rams.

The Patriots and Broncos are tied for the best record in the AFC and are two games ahead of Jacksonville, the Chargers and the Bills.

AFC South teams make moves

Things evolved rapidly in the AFC South over the last month, culminating in two new teams sitting on top after Week 14. Earlier this season, it looked like a potential runaway for the Indianapolis Colts — who sat at +1100 Super Bowl odds and a potential top playoff seed in the AFC after Week 11.

Fast forward to now: The two biggest risers are the rival Houston Texans (+1500) and Jacksonville Jaguars (+2000), with Indianapolis (+15000) completely free-falling.

The Texans earned a huge road win in Kansas City to continue their five-game winning streak. Jacksonville defeated the Colts in the first of two December matchups to improve to a four-game winning streak.

The losing stretch for Indianapolis, coupled with the season-ending Achilles injury to quarterback Daniel Jones, dropped them from +1500 odds and eighth place to 19th in a week. Currently outside of the AFC playoff picture and without its starting QB, it could be a miserable second-half for the Colts after the promising 8-2 start.

Former favorites finally fall down the board

Two season-long favorites finally saw sharp falls down the board after hovering in the second tier in recent weeks. It appears the Super Bowl market finally ran out of patience for the Baltimore Ravens (+3500) and Kansas City Chiefs (+5000).

Both teams sat at +1700 odds before Week 14 losses put both at 6-7. While the Ravens’ loss to Pittsburgh put them only one game out of first place in the AFC North, a home loss to Houston tanked Kansas City’s Super Bowl odds.

Baltimore needs to keep winning to have a chance at the AFC North and finishes Week 18 with a rematch in Pittsburgh.

The Chiefs are still two games out of the final AFC playoff spot with four weeks left. They likely need to win out and would still need significant help just to make the postseason. For a team that was atop BetMGM’s Super Bowl odds from Week 7 through Week 11, that’s a significant fall.

A popular dark horse in recent weeks, the Chicago Bears (+5000) also saw a significant decline in odds with the loss in Green Bay.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/09144201/GettyImages-2250584375-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-10 11:05:46.055782

Jones injury fallout | Moves for falling contenders

Open coach jobs | What's next for Vance Joseph

What are you hearing on how Daniel Jones' injury could affect free agency and the QB market?

Graziano: I've heard a few theories in the couple of days since Jones injured his Achilles. One is that it makes sense for him to re-sign with the Colts, since they know him and know he can run their offense. He could rehab with them all offseason and hit the ground running whenever he's cleared. That could be on another one-year deal or maybe a two-year deal with incentives that could make the second year more lucrative if he recovers fully and plays well.

Another is that it would make sense for him to go back to Minnesota, where he finished last season as Sam Darnold's backup, and rehab there with a staff that knows him and wanted to retain him but couldn't guarantee him the starting job this past offseason. Either way, the idea of a lucrative, long-term contract extension in Indianapolis (or somewhere else) probably slides to the back burner in light of Jones' most recent season-ending injury.

The other thing to consider, Jeremy, is who's going to be making the decisions for the Colts this offseason, since there has been chatter about coaches and front office personnel being on the hot seat since last offseason. I wonder how a potential late-season collapse (if that what's coming) would affect things on that front.

Fowler: The Colts' brass had quelled the noise with this season's hot start, Dan, but new owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon will evaluate the full body of work. Since a repeat 8-9 season is still on the table, finishing with seven consecutive losses wouldn't be the best thing for the future tenures of head coach Shane Steichen or general manager Chris Ballard. But I think everyone there recognizes that Indy has built a good team that thrived over the season's first 10 games -- especially Jones, who remains the top free agent quarterback available despite this injury.

If the Colts and Vikings pursue Jones, then he has a nice little market to drive up his demand. But maybe it doesn't get that far ... if Indianapolis puts the franchise or transition tag on Jones. That's not totally off the table after asking around. Those numbers are projected somewhere between $39 million and $46 million. Either way, getting creative with the contract to cover both sides will be important, but Jones will need security beyond a one-year deal considering how late in the calendar year the Achilles tear occurred.

So, the injury is a factor, but I'm not so sure it affects his market too much. As you know, Dan, the upcoming free agent class isn't exactly loaded at quarterback.

Graziano: Sure, but I guess the point of the question is more about the reduced likelihood of a big deal, like a Baker Mayfield-type deal or Darnold-level deal -- or heck, even the type of deal Jones got from the Giants a few years back. I think that's the impact of the injury -- that he and whichever team he ends up with will have to be creative and, as you suggest, build something that gives Jones some time to not only get back onto the field but also get back to playing at a relatively high level.

Jones is still only 28, so there's certainly plenty of hope for him to recover and still have a future in the league. But this is also the third season-ending injury of his career, and that history has to be a concern for whichever team is interested in signing him.

Fowler: That's valid. My sense is Indianapolis will want to see how Jones is progressing in his rehab before deciding. That will help inform the team on how to proceed. If the Colts believe Jones will be a productive starter for them over the next three to four seasons, then perhaps paying him a respectable market deal now will be a discount in two years, instead of haggling over the level of discount required because of the injury.

Jones has been Indy's most viable quarterback option since Andrew Luck, so the Colts might not be afraid to pay him big. Coaches and teammates there love him. And a few other teams could be facing a quarterback transition -- the Browns, Jets and Raiders among them.

What is one realistic offseason move that could help fix a fallen preseason favorite?

Fowler: The Chiefs and Ravens are both teams that need a classic boundary receiver on the outside and could address that with one big move in free agency. George Pickens would be a significant upgrade in Baltimore, and Alec Pierce would satisfy that need in Kansas City, which has been starved for explosive playmaking on the outside since Tyreek Hill was traded after the 2021 season.

Both would be costly, and Pickens might be franchise tagged by Dallas. But if available, the Ravens could use some of their $40 million in 2026 cap space on Pickens, knowing John Harbaugh is good at managing big personalities. The Chiefs are much lower on space, sitting at minus-$42.8 million, but cuts are on the way for a team that might look drastically different this time next year. Also, adding an explosive running back such as Breece Hall or Travis Etienne Jr. is worth exploring for Kansas City.

Graziano: Running back makes sense for the Chiefs, as does diversifying their WR room. I wonder if missing the playoffs and having a reset forced upon them might not be the worst thing in the world -- though I'm sure the Chiefs don't see it that way.

The Commanders need pass-rush help, linebacker help, secondary help ... all of it. I wouldn't be stunned if they devoted most of their draft resources to the defense, though they don't have any picks in the second or fourth rounds because of the Laremy Tunsil trade. On offense, Washington is a spot a lot of people have pegged as a potential destination for Brandon Aiyuk, as it's believed he'd like to team up with former Arizona State teammate Jayden Daniels.

Fowler: The Aiyuk-Washington connection makes a ton of sense. Speaking of the Commanders, it was shocking to me when they didn't aggressively address pass rusher last offseason. As a result, their sack leader is Dorance Armstrong -- who tore his ACL in Week 7 -- with 5.5. Plenty of pass rushers should be available in free agency. But Washington could also identify rushers on rookie deals who might want a trade due to inactivity on a contract extension with their current team. The Jaguars' Travon Walker, Giants' Kayvon Thibodeaux and Jets' Jermaine Johnson are among players on expiring rookie deals who could be 2027 free agents.

As for Cincinnati, Dan, the Bengals need everything on defense except maybe a cornerback. Up the middle, there's a need at every level (defensive line, linebacker, safety).

Graziano: Trey Hendrickson seems certain to be leaving Cincinnati, which hasn't exactly hit it out of the park with its recent, high-round edge rusher draft picks. The Bengals don't spend big, but they hit in free agency once upon a time with Hendrickson, and I think they'll look for a solution along those lines again this offseason.

So yes, I'm interested to see what the Bengals do on defense. Do they give Al Golden a second year as coordinator, or are we looking at another scheme change? The way they feel their linebackers have improved as the season has progressed makes me think they'll run it back with Golden and add players he thinks fit his system. I always wonder if the Bengals will get creative with a player-for-player trade and bring in someone like Thibodeaux or Byron Young, who could be available toward the tail end of their rookie deals.

What's the over/under on open head coaching jobs this offseason?

Graziano: I'll set it at six, since two (Titans and Giants) are already open and we're watching for potential change in places such as Las Vegas, Atlanta, Arizona, Miami, Cleveland and Cincinnati. I'm not saying all of those will come open, of course, but it wouldn't be shocking if three or four of them did.

Pete Carroll's first season with Raiders has been a disaster and they've already let go of two coordinators. The Falcons and Cardinals had higher preseason expectations than what has been delivered (though I lean toward Arizona keeping its coaches and letting them try to develop a quarterback post-Kyler Murray). It sounds as if Mike McDaniel has a chance to save his job in Miami with a strong finish, which he seems to be on his way to putting together, but any time the GM gets fired midseason (as Chris Grier was in Miami), more potential change could be on the way.

Kevin Stefanski isn't necessarily to blame for the Browns' quarterback mess, but his record the past two seasons is 6-24 and a turnaround doesn't seem imminent. A couple of people have suggested to me that Stefanski would be of interest to other teams if the Browns moved on, as he's well-regarded around the league. And the Bengals are unpredictable, and Zac Taylor has only one year left on his deal. Then again, he's either the most or second-most successful coach in franchise history, has established a contending culture and is well liked by the star quarterback. So my guess is he returns. But again, more was expected this season in Cincinnati, so at the very least we have our antennae up.

Fowler: A spot-on breakdown of the landscape, Dan, and though I'd love to say seven openings for entertainment, I'm not sure I can get there yet. I'll stand firm with you at six. Picking up where you left off, Bengals owner Mike Brown operates a little differently -- perhaps he lets Taylor coach out his contract that runs through 2026. It feels as if anything is possible there. Across the state, one thing that helps Stefanski's case is that Browns owner Jimmy Haslam finally found a dependable infrastructure with Stefanski and GM Andrew Berry, and the two-year struggle can be directly tied to the failed Deshaun Watson experiment. The team is very young but should be good in 2026 due to their exciting 2025 rookie class. That said, 6-24 is 6-24. Let's see what happens over the next month.

I'm with you on the Cardinals. Keeping Jonathan Gannon is a sensible play for owner Michael Bidwill. But Arizona is staring at a potential 1-14 finish. The team is miserably bad right now and finishes the season with the Texans, Falcons, Bengals and Rams. Gannon might need to win one, maybe two games to reach solid footing. The Raiders are really struggling, which should surprise no one given the talent disparity. This team needs someone to usher in the rebuild. And McDaniel is helping his cause with Dolphins, and enough people around the league think he has made a compelling case to stay.

So, if we're sliding Miami out of the mix, that means four of the five spots you mentioned above would need to open to reach six. That's entirely possible, especially with the smoke rising around Raheem Morris in Atlanta. If we're forecasting potential surprises, what comes to mind? There's usually at least one.

Graziano: Well, my stock answer to that is always, ""If I knew that, it wouldn't be a surprise!"" But you're right, there does always seem to be one that catches us off guard. I keep getting asked if I think the Steelers or Ravens jobs would come open if either team were to miss the playoffs. I don't think they will come open, but the market would shake up in a big way if I'm wrong.

Andy Reid turns 68 next spring and there were retirement noises swirling around him a couple of years ago, but I think the contract extension he received indicates that he's not interested in hanging it up any time soon -- especially with how disappointing this season seems to be for the Chiefs. How about you? What's your surprise pick?

Fowler: The Ravens are really interesting. That would qualify as a pretty major surprise, and while I think Harbaugh stays, something seems off there. They should not be 6-7 based on their roster talent. The lack of offensive production has been a source of frustration internally. This feels more like a reset in 2026, with multiple staff changes on the way. The Mike Tomlin smoke surfaces annually, but he's fiercely loyal to Pittsburgh, and here he is rallying the Steelers to a big late-season divisional win again. We touched on the Colts earlier ... that would qualify as a surprise, too.

What are you hearing about Vance Joseph's chances to land a head coach gig? Is he the top candidate at the moment?

Fowler: The coaching pool is strongest on the defensive side this year, and Joseph is well-positioned among available defense-oriented candidates. His Broncos defense set a franchise record with 63 sacks in 2024, which this year's defense easily should break, with 55 sacks through 13 games. Former head coaches will be a theme this year, and Joseph has head coaching experience. Much will depend on exactly what teams are looking for and the interview process, but he should get plenty of chances. If Miami opens, remember that Joseph was a finalist for the Dolphins job that went to Mike McDaniel in 2022 and is still well-regarded there.

Graziano: Joseph seems to be the name we're hearing the most, because of Denver's defensive success and his previous head coach experience (with Denver, oddly enough). People close to the situation point out that Joseph never had a stable quarterback situation in his first head coaching stint and didn't have full autonomy over the hiring of his staff, so it would seem unfair to completely hold his 11-21 record against him. I think he gets several interviews and could be a strong candidate in a place such as Las Vegas, should that job come open.

Fowler: Joseph is part of a crowded class of defensive coordinators. The Rams' Chris Shula, Packers' Jeff Hafley, Chargers' Jesse Minter and Dolphins' Anthony Weaver are all ascending coordinators looking to be first-time coaches. The Seahawks' Adin Durde and Jaguars' Anthony Campanile are under-the-radar names bubbling to the surface. And the 49ers' Robert Saleh has reestablished himself as a potential second-time head coach after helping lead injury-hampered San Francisco to a winning season. Lou Anarumo has also reestablished himself in Indy.

Graziano: I think the key point you made earlier, which I keep hearing from people in discussions about this coaching cycle, is that teams will be looking for candidates with previous head coaching experience. There's a thought that the coordinator pool, especially on the offensive side, has dried up a bit because of all the quick hirings and firings of the past decade-plus.

People see what Mike Vrabel has been able to do in New England this season and what Jim Harbaugh has been able to do with the Chargers in his first two years there, and teams want to make sure they're bringing in someone they know can run a program -- not someone who has just been really good at the smaller job who they think can run a program. I think that gives guys like Joseph, Arthur Smith, Matt Nagy, etc. a chance. Even if they weren't successful in their first stints as head coaches, they've done the job and probably learned from whatever mistakes they might have made the first time.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1209%2Fr1587239_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 09:01:04.124437

The longtime star quarterback, who retired after the 2020 season -- his 17th in the NFL -- is rejoining the Indianapolis Colts on their practice squad, sources told ESPN, amid an injury crisis that has left them with three sidelined quarterbacks.

Rivers worked out for the Colts on Monday evening. The news comes one day after Rivers' 44th birthday, instantly making him the oldest active player in the NFL.

That positions him to be an option to play in place of third-string quarterback Riley Leonard, who sustained a knee injury while relieving Daniel Jones in Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Jones sustained a right Achilles tear and will undergo season-ending surgery this week. Anthony Richardson Sr., who began the season as the No. 2 quarterback, has been on injured reserve since October after suffering a serious facial fracture in an equipment failure involving stretching bands.

It remains to be seen what Rivers' immediate role will be. Leonard's status for the Colts' next game, at the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday, is still unclear. The team is hoping for more clarity Wednesday, according to a source.

On Monday, coach Shane Steichen left the door open. When asked whether Leonard would play Sunday, he said, ""That's the hope. We'll see how it goes."" A source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Monday night that Leonard had a strained knee ligament and was considered week-to-week.

If Leonard can't play, Rivers might enter the picture. Still remembered fondly at Colts headquarters following his one season with Indianapolis in 2020, Rivers will be reunited with his close friend Steichen. The two previously spent six seasons together in the Chargers organization while Steichen was an assistant coach and Rivers was the team's longtime quarterback.

They remain in regular contact and often discuss football matters on a weekly basis. Steichen's relationship with Rivers helped this arrangement come together, according to sources.

According to sources, Rivers' workout was impressive. He threw the ball well but needs to improve his conditioning, according to a source. How that impacts his ability to play this week, if necessary, is unclear.

Rivers is currently a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Class of 2026. Per the Hall of Fame, Rivers signing to the Colts' practice squad has no effect on his eligibility. However, if he signs to the Colts' active roster, his eligibility clock would reset, whether or not he takes a snap in a game, and he wouldn't be eligible again until 2031.

Rivers' 2020 Colts performance was impressive. The Colts finished 11-5 with Rivers under center, making the playoffs as an AFC wild card. They lost to the Buffalo Bills in a first-round game and, several weeks later, Rivers decided to walk away from the NFL.

No Colts team since that 2020 squad has averaged more passing yards than the 253.3 per game produced with Rivers at the controls. Indianapolis won four of its last five games that season to clinch a playoff spot. And Rivers delivered throughout the season, completing 68% of his pass attempts and throwing 24 touchdown passes.

The mere exploration of Rivers as a possibility speaks to the dearth of options for Indianapolis. The Colts also have journeyman Brett Rypien on their practice squad, but he has yet to be added to the active roster this season.

If Rivers starts a game for the Colts this season, he would become the fifth quarterback in NFL history to start a game at age 44 or older, joining Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Steve DeBerg and Warren Moon, according to ESPN Research.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2021%2F0110%2Fr800285_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 04:57:52.124610

Shaheed’s breakout game is great sign for Seahawks

Sundell, who started the first nine games of the season at center, has missed the past four games after suffering a knee injury in Seattle’s Week 10 rout of the Arizona Cardinals on Nov. 9. Backup center Olu Oluwatimi has started the past four games in Sundell’s place.

Macdonald said “we’ll see” when asked whether Sundell will play center or guard going forward.

There’s been speculation that Seattle could consider keeping Oluwatimi at center and sliding Sundell over to right guard, where Anthony Bradford has struggled at times this season.

Sundell, a second-year undrafted offensive lineman out of North Dakota State, has the positional flexibility to play center or guard. Oluwatimi is solely a center.

Sundell and Oluwatimi were in a two-man battle for the starting center job throughout training camp. Sundell ultimately won the competition after Oluwatimi dealt with a back injury that sidelined him for all three preseason games.

Bradford showing improvement

Bradford, who has started all 13 games at right guard this season, had a particularly rough first seven games. Through Week 7, he ranked 73rd out of 82 guards in Pro Football Focus grading, including 79th in pass block grading. During that span, he allowed two sacks and 17 pressures.

But since Seattle’s Week 8 bye, Bradford has played much better. Over the past six games, he ranks 52nd out of 81 guards in PFF grading, including 30th in pass block grading. And during that span, he’s allowed no sacks and just three pressures.

“AB graded out as our highest offensive lineman (Sunday), and he’s playing hard and he’s got a great punch,” Macdonald said. “I think his overall confidence is probably at a high point in his career at this point – practicing really well, practices hard. I mean, doing all those steps that it takes to end up (playing) good football out on the field.

“And I know there’s some plays that are minuses or plays that aren’t up to par, but there’s a lot of great plays as well, and I thought he had a good game yesterday.”

The latest on Arroyo

Macdonald said rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo could miss Seattle’s upcoming game against the Indianapolis Colts after suffering a knee injury in Sunday’s win over the Atlanta Falcons.

Arroyo, a second-round draft pick out of Miami, has 15 catches for 179 yards and a touchdown this season. He has played 39.5% of the Seahawks’ offensive snaps.

“Just working through it right now, but I’d say that this week is probably in jeopardy for him,” Macdonald said.

Will Rivers, celebrating his 44th birthday Monday, Dec. 8, return to guide a desperate team in search of a playoff berth?

NFL Network is reporting that the Colts will bring in Rivers to potentially suit up in the wake of Daniel Jones' season-ending injury and Riley Leonard's knee issue that leaves him uncertain for Week 15 against the Seattle Seahawks.

What started as a season of surprise has turned into disbelief at how quickly the Colts have been given an uncertain future.","Ten weeks into the NFL season, the Indianapolis Colts were the surprise of the league.

After a 31-25 win over the Atlanta Falcons in Berlin on Nov. 9, the Colts were 8-2, tied for the most wins in the AFC, and had a legitimate chance to be the No. 1 seed in the conference headed into the playoffs.

But just one month later, Indianapolis is 8-5, loser of three straight and owner of a murky future after a risky trade and a catastrophic injury.

Things started going downhill with a losing streak that included two close defeats.

The Colts had a 20-9 fourth-quarter lead on the road against the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 12, only to give up the final 14 points of the game and lose in overtime. The next week, Indianapolis was tied 13-13 with the Houston Texans in the fourth before losing 20-16.

The wheels came off Sunday in a loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Not only was Indianapolis blown out 36-19, but quarterback Daniel Jones — an early-season MVP candidate and one of the feel-good stories of the year — also tore his right Achilles, ending his season.

“That’s our team leader, our team captain,” wide receiver Alec Pierce told reporters after the game. “It’s brutal.”

After the loss to the Jaguars, Indianapolis went from tied for first place in the AFC South to out of the playoff picture entirely, and it now faces issues on multiple fronts.

Having lost four of their last five games, the Colts are in danger of missing the playoffs entirely. Indianapolis has four games left, all against teams that would currently be in the playoffs. (The .692 winning percentage of the Colts’ remaining opponents is the highest in the NFL, per Tankathon.)

In addition to the injury to Jones, backup quarterback and rookie Riley Leonard is dealing with a knee injury, head coach Shane Steichen said Monday. Steichen added “the hope” is that Leonard can play Sunday, though there is no guarantee.

The only other healthy quarterback on the team is Brett Rypien, who is on the practice squad. Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 overall pick in the 2023 draft, has thrown only two passes in garbage time this season and is on injured reserve with an orbital fracture.

How severe is the situation? Indianapolis reportedly will work out 44-year-old Philip Rivers on Tuesday. Rivers last played in the NFL for the Colts in 2020 and announced his retirement in January 2021. He has since been coaching high school football in Alabama.

In his lone year with Indianapolis, Rivers went 11-5, completing 68.0% of his passes for 4,169 yards, with 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He also has experience with Steichen, who was an assistant coach with the then-San Diego Chargers from 2014 to 2019 while Rivers was on the team.

Meanwhile, the injury to Jones puts Indianapolis in a tricky situation with regard to the team’s future at quarterback.

Jones is on a one-year contract that pays him only $14 million. He was almost certainly in line for a massive raise before the injury, though he had cooled off after his hot start to the season.

Now, the Colts will have to make a decision on Jones without the valuable information that could have been gleaned from his play down the stretch and in the playoffs. Indianapolis will also have to figure out how much to pay a player coming off a significant injury and whether Jones will even be ready by the start of next season.

On top of all that, it’s possible an even more desperate team could outbid the Colts for Jones’ services.

Indianapolis certainly seemed committed to its current build around Jones, so much so that in November it traded first-round picks in 2026 and 2027 for cornerback Sauce Gardner, who missed the loss to Jacksonville with a calf injury. That means that even if the Colts wanted an option to move on from Jones in the near future, they won’t be able to draft a quarterback in the first round until 2028 unless they make another trade.

How to move forward will be a series of high-stakes decisions for Indianapolis. The best-case scenario, almost regardless of what happens the rest of this year, is for Jones to come back in time for next season and resemble the player he was for much of 2025.

What started as a season of surprise has turned into disbelief at how quickly the Colts have been given an uncertain future.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251208-Daniel-Jones-gk-3f72bd.jpg",N,,2025-12-10 03:58:14.928786

Gordon has appeared in just three games this season, and he's served two separate stints on injured reserve. A lingering hamstring injury cost him the first four games of the season, and after a short return, Gordon suffered groin and calf injuries that landed him back on IR. He returned in Week 13 against the Eagles.

“It’s disappointing,"" Johnson said. ""I wish I had a better feel for the individual. But with him being out as much as he has been, I haven’t really gotten to see him on the field and competing and get to know him like I’d like to at this point yet.

""I do know the biggest predictor of a soft-tissue injury is having a previous one and he’s kind of in this rut right now that we’re not able to get out of. So we’re going to exhaust all of our resources in and outside of the building to make sure we’re addressing it and doing what we can to get him back and healthy again.”

The last time Rivers was in the NFL, he played under current Colts head coach Shane Steichen, who served as QBs coach for Indy from 2016-2019. Rivers has a longstanding relationship with Steichen, who was previously with the Chargers dating back to the 2011-12 season.

Over the course of his 17 seasons in the NFL, Rivers passed for 63,440 yards with 421 touchdowns to 209 interceptions while earning eight Pro Bowl nods. He was also the ACC Player of the Year and holds multiple records for NC State prior to his NFL career that have led to his jersey number being honored in the Ring of Honor for the Wolfpack.

Rivers is also the head coach of the St. Michael Catholic football program, coaching his son Gunner Rivers at quarterback -- who was recently on a visit to Raleigh -- along with NC State signee Noah Moss at running back. But with the high school season wrapped up after a long postseason run to the semifinals in Alabama, Rivers now has nothing but time on his hands to potentially play for the Colts.

The current starting quarterback for the Colts also happens to be a former ACC player in Riley Leonard -- who initially started his career with Duke -- and Rivers could help lead him the rest of the way. And with a chance to get the franchise back to the playoffs, this will be an interesting story to watch for

Rivers, who last played for the Colts five years ago, was coaching high school football in Alabama.

The Colts are turning to Rivers due to a lack of available quarterback options late in the season.

For the second time in franchise history, the Colts are turning to Philip Rivers for stability at quarterback.

Indianapolis is signing Rivers to the practice squad, a league source confirmed to IndyStar on Tuesday, one day after the Chargers legend turned 44 and five years after he spent his final season leading the Colts to the playoffs, the franchise’s last postseason appearance.

The move is a shot in the dark, but the situation is dire in Indianapolis.

Indianapolis, at 8-5, has a chance to break its playoff drought, but the team’s chances dropped precipitously in the franchise's latest loss at Jacksonville on Sunday, and only a little because the Colts fell 36-19.

Starting quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a torn Achilles tendon early in the game, and backup Riley Leonard — only in the No. 2 role because backup quarterback Anthony Richardson is on injured reserve — emerged from his first extended action with a knee injury that didn’t fully reveal itself until Monday morning.

Few NFL teams can withstand the loss of their starting quarterback.

The Colts lost their top three in early December, a date so late on the NFL calendar that almost all of the available options are already playing elsewhere. Indianapolis could try to pry a quarterback off a practice squad, but any practice-squad quarterback is already in a No. 3 role for a reason, and a player can choose to stay with his current team.

For example, former Colts backup Sam Ehlinger reportedly turned down two offers from other teams to join their 53-man roster after he was cut in August, according to ESPN, preferring to stay in Denver. It is not known if Indianapolis tried to get Ehlinger back at any point this season, either after Richardson was injured in October or during the decision-making process that led to Rivers this week.

With all three quarterbacks out and only veteran Brett Rypien on the practice squad, Indianapolis decided to break the glass in case of emergency, calling Rivers a little more than a week after the high school football team he coaches in Fairhope, Ala., lost to Jackson in a state semifinal.

Five years after he last played in the NFL, it’s anybody’s guess how Rivers will play if given the opportunity.

The Colts ultimately decided he was better than any other option available and convinced Rivers to come back.

Rivers remains close with Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen, a friend and confidant from their Chargers days, and he made a strong impression on the Colts in the one season he spent in Indianapolis.

Rivers turned in the best season of any Colts starting quarterback since Andrew Luck in 2020, completing 68% of his passes for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, 7.7 yards per attempt and a 97.0 quarterback rating while leading Indianapolis to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth.

Former Colts head coach Frank Reich publicly said he wanted Rivers back for a second season in Indianapolis after the team's 27-24 loss to Buffalo in the wild card round. Rivers initially wasn't sure, and although general manager Chris Ballard told the then-39-year-old that both sides should take a month to decide, Rivers retired a couple of weeks later.

Rivers always wanted to coach his sons in high school, the same way his father coached him at Athens High in Alabama. A father of 10, Rivers has three sons, and the oldest, Gunner, is now a four-star prospect in the class of 2027, Rivers' quarterback at St. Michael Catholic

But he kept the possibility of playing in the NFL alive. While committed to St. Michael Catholic, Rivers has talked to teams about playing in an emergency capacity before; San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan has acknowledged that Rivers would have quarterbacked the 49ers in the Super Bowl in 2023 if they had somehow beaten the Eagles in the NFC Championship Game despite every quarterback on the roster dealing with injury.

Indianapolis is in that position now.

Leonard, the team's first choice to start with Jones and Richardson unavailable, is dealing with a right knee injury, and it was unclear early in the week if the rookie would be available against Seattle this weekend.

Rivers has already been a mentor to Leonard. Leonard trained with Rivers in Fairhope, Ala., before playing the 2024 season with Notre Dame and again before the NFL Draft last summer, and the two have a strong bond, a lot like the one Rivers has formed with Steichen and the rest of the Colts front office.

If Leonard cannot go on Sunday, Rivers is an option to start against a Seahawks defense that ranks in the top 10 in almost every major category, although Rypien is another option.

Presumably, Rivers wouldn't have come out of retirement -- and potentially delayed his Hall of Fame candidacy; he was eligible for the first time in 2025 -- to sit.

But one of his former teams, and one of his best friends, needed help, and Rivers decided he could answer the call.

G Davion Mitchell is currently listed as probable due to a groin injury and is expected to play. It is worth noting that Mitchell did miss Miami’s most recent game against the Sacramento Kings on Saturday as he was dealing with groin tightness.

As the team’s starting point guard, Mitchell has been an integral part of the Heat’s offense since being acquired by the franchise in the trade that sent Jimmy Butler to the Golden State Warriors last February.

Davion Mitchell Injury Update vs. Magic Tonight

Mitchell practices with the Heat on Monday prior to the team's four-game road trip that begins with Tuesday’s NBA Cup quarterfinal matchup.

The Baylor product is currently listed as probable, which means that he’ll likely suit up.

However, Mitchell did miss Saturday’s 127-111 loss vs. the Sacramento Kings due to groin tightness and his presence was sorely missed. The former first-round pick serves as Miami’s starting point guard and the Heat were forced to play Dru Smith in that spot against Sacramento.

In 23 starts this season, Mitchell is averaging 9.7 points and a team-high 7.8 assists. He also has become known for his defensive acumen.

Target Tyler Herro If Davion Mitchell Is Out?

It appears that all signs are pointing towards Mitchell playing in Tuesday’s NBA Cup quarterfinal matchup. However, just in case he suffers a setback, there are other Heat players that could see increased production if he were to miss the contest.

Much like Mitchell, G Tyler Herro has been a little banged up as of late. In fact, Herro is also listed as probable for Tuesday’s game due to a toe injury.

Herro, who shares the Miami backcourt with Mitchell, also missed the first month of the season with an ankle injury, but has thrived since returning. In five games since rejoining the team, Herro is averaging 23.8 points and 4.6 rebounds, while shooting a staggering 48.4% from three.

Herro is coming off a performance in which he scored 20 points on 8-of-17 shooting and grabbed four rebounds in a 118-108 loss vs. the Dallas Mavericks on Dec. 3. He sat out the ensuing two games, but looks to be ready to make his return on Tuesday.

Veteran safety Kyle Dugger also could, as well, after he did not play in this past Sunday’s win at the Baltimore Ravens.

As is his unofficial policy, Tomlin declined to speculate on the status of players in NFL concussion protocol, of which this week the Steelers have three who left the victory against the Ravens: fill-in left tackle Andrus Peat, inside linebacker Malik Harrison and tight end Darnell Washington.

Peat was the third left tackle to play in a three-game span; Broderick Jones (neck) is on injured reserve and Calvin Anderson (knee) is out again this week. Fourth-string Dylan Cook remains on the practice squad but is the next man up if Peat is not cleared.

Tomlin said cornerback James Pierre (calf) and wide receiver Ben Skowronek (finger) will be limited at practice early in the week but should be able to play against the Dolphins.

Metcalf ‘fine’

Tomlin said that No. 1 receiver DK Metcalf is “moving in the right direction” after a stomach ailment compelled the team to leave him behind a night in Baltimore instead of taking off on the team plane home.

Metcalf got evaluated at a Baltimore hospital but was released and returned to Pittsburgh on Monday.

“I don’t think it’s going to jeopardize his (game) availability at all, but it certainly may jeopardize his availability at the early portions of the week from a practice standpoint,” Tomlin said. “But thankfully, he’s fine. I’m appreciative of our medical staff and how quickly they acted in making sure that he was safe and taking care of him post-game.”

Tomlin said Metcalf sustained a hit in the abdominal area and during the game was given some over-the-counter stomach remedies.

“Like Pepto, or something like that,” Tomlin said. “(The pain) got probably progressively worse after the game, and so I’m appreciative of our medical experts. We just exercised an abundance of precaution. We didn’t want to get him in the air without having a complete understanding about what he was dealing with, and they did a good job of that.”",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/12/9113783_web1_ptr-Tomlin01-120225.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 06:58:48.405795

He will reportedly join the Colts for practices ahead of Sunday's game at Seattle.

Quarterback Daniel Jones tore his right Achilles in Sunday's defeat at Jacksonville and will have season-ending surgery.

Third-string Riley Leonard, the only quarterback listed on the Colts' depth chart, suffered a knee injury after replacing Jones.

Indianapolis were already without prior backup signal-caller, Anthony Richardson, who suffered an orbital fracture in October.

Rivers will work with Leonard, a rookie taken in the sixth round of this year's NFL Draft, but also learn the Colts schemes with an eye to possibly playing on Sunday, according to the reports.

Only four quarterbacks in NFL history have started a game at age 44 or older -- seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg.

The Colts (8-5) are one spot out of the AFC playoffs but will be tested in the final weeks of the campaign by Seattle (10-3), San Francisco (9-4), Jacksonville (9-4) and Houston (8-5).

Rivers, who has never played in a Super Bowl, spent 16 seasons with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers before playing his final year with the Colts in 2020.

Indy went 11-5 that season and reached the playoffs, a feat the Colts have not achieved since.

Rivers, who has been serving as a high school football coach, has not thrown an NFL pass since January 2021.

He signed a one-day contract with the Chargers last July so he could retire as a member of that team.

Rivers is a friend of Colts head coach Shane Steichen. They spent six seasons together when Steichen was an assistant coach for the Chargers.

QB Daniel Jones

Torn Achilles: Out for the year

Jones’ 2025 season has come to an end, unfortunately. He tore his right Achilles tendon on Sunday against Jacksonville and is now out for the year after undergoing surgery. The injury comes at a very difficult time as Jones is not under contract next year. He’ll be a free agent who will be rehabbing all off-season, making it a pretty challenging task to learn a new offense/adapt to a new scheme if he ends up leaving Indy. Either way, Jones has a chance to be ready for the start of next year, but he won’t be anywhere near 100% in the opening month. This is also his right leg, which is problematic for a right handed QB as that right leg is used to drive forward during the throwing motion. That could easily impact is downfield accuracy and power. To make matters worse for Indy, Anthony Richardson remains on IR (orbital bone fracture) and rookie Riley Leonard left last week’s game with a PCL sprain in his knee. The team is working out 44 year old Philip Rivers (Pee River!) and has Brett Rypien Farts on the practice squad.

Players impacted: Jonathan Taylor, Michael Pittman, Alec Pierce, Tyler Warren

QB Tyrod Taylor

Groin Strain: Doubtful for Week 15

Tyrod left in the first quarter Sunday with a groin injury and did not return. He could theoretically play this week as a strict pocket passer, but we should expect minimal to no mobility as a scrambler, which is a big component of Tyrod’s game. If he can’t play, it would in theory be Justin Fields under center, but Fields was inactive this past week due to a knee injury (unclear on diagnosis). As a result, it was rookie Brady Cook who entered in relief of Taylor. Needless to say, the Jets have major QB issues ahead of their Week 15 tilt with the Jags.

Players impacted: Justin Fields/Brady Cook

QB Jayden Daniels

Left Elbow Soreness: Questionable for Week 15

Daniels returned to the lineup this week for his first start since dislocating his left elbow back in Week 9. Unfortunately, after throwing an INT, he was pushed to the ground by a defensive player and landed on that left elbow. Daniels was in obvious pain and was evaluated in the medical tent but did not return. Dan Quinn confirmed that Daniels could have entered the game if it were close, choosing to hold him out as a precaution given the score was already out of hand when the injury occurred. The good news here is that the elbow was not necessarily “re-injured” per se. This is more of a soreness/pain issue rather than a new injury. Still, you’d have to think the Commanders take a long look at this situation and decide whether or not they want to put him back out there given the state of their season. It wouldn’t be surprising to see the team exercise caution with their young QB, so it could certainly be Marcus Mariota this week. If Daniels does play, he’ll continue to wear the brace on his left elbow.

Players impacted: Marcus Mariota, Terry McLaurin, Deebo Samuel

QB Geno Smith

Right Shoulder Injury: Week-to-week

Geno was initially evaluated for a right hand laceration but later left the game a second time because of a right shoulder injury. He landed hard on that right shoulder while being taken to the turf by a Bronco defender, which caused the injury. Fortunately, Pete Carroll said there is no “structural damage” to Geno’s shoulder, but you could see the training staff working on is shoulder and neck on the sideline. He’s likely going to miss practice reps this week, and given the state of the Raiders’ season, it’s possible we see the team give a look to Kenny Pickett.

Players impacted: Kenny Pickett, Brock Bowers

RB DeVon Achane

Rib Injury: Likely to play in Week 15

Achane exited in the first half against the Jets with a rib injury after falling on the football and did not return. X-rays and an MRI showed no rib fractures, so this is a situation where Achane is likely more “hurt than injured.” The team remains optimistic that Achane can play in Week 15, and I am as well. He might play with a flak jacket and/or a pre-game injection if necessary, but I do expect him out there on Monday night. The extra day of rest/treatment should help.

Players impacted: Jaylen Wright, Ollie Gordon

RB Nick Chubb

Rib Injury: Questionable for Week 15

Chubb left Sunday night’s game early with a rib injury and did not return, which resulted in Woody Marks getting a ton of work as the bell cow. I haven’t seen any updates on Chubb’s status as of early Tuesday morning, so we’ll have to monitor the Texans’ injury report ahead of Week 15. For now, consider him Questionable for their game against the Cardinals.

Players impacted: Woody Marks

WR CeeDee Lamb

Concussion Protocol: Questionable for Week 15

Lamb left last Thursday’s game against the Lions with a concussion and did not return. As of Tuesday he remains in the protocol, so we’ll need to track his status throughout the week. Fortunately, the extra few days should help Lamb have a chance to return to action this week, but of course, the progression through protocol is symptom based, not time based. Hopefully, he can at least get in an LP on Wednesday.

Players impacted: Dak Prescott, George Pickens, Jake Ferguson

WR Tee Higgins

Concussion Protocol: Likely out for the year

Higgins missed a game a couple of weeks ago because of a concussion, and on Sunday against Buffalo in his return, his hit his head on the frozen ground multiple times. During the game, he cleared protocol, but on Monday, Zac Taylor told the media that Higgins is now back in the protocol after reporting symptoms following the game. Repeat head injuries in a short amount of time tends to lead to a longer recovery, and these second-insult injuries can have long term ramifications. Cincinnati cannot afford to have Tee pick up a third head injury this season, and with the Bengals now essentially out of playoff contention, I see them taking the long-view with their star WR. I expect him to miss multiple games, and given that it’s already Week 15, it would make sense to put him on IR and keep him out for the remainder of the season.

Players impacted: Ja’Marr Chase, Joe Burrow, Mike Gesicki

TE Zach Ertz

Right Knee ACL+ Injury: Out for the year

It’s been an awesome career for Ertz, but sadly, his 2025 season has come to an end after he suffered a complex right knee injury. A defender hit the front of his knee, causing a hyper-extension injury. It’s already been confirmed that Ertz tore his ACL, but this is one of those injuries where you worry about additional damage, particularly to the PCL. Given the multi-ligament injury, Ertz is not going to be anywhere close to 100% in the first two months of next season. It’s certainly possible that this injury is career threatening just given where he’s at in his NFL journey.

Players impacted: Jayden Daniels/Marcus Mariota, Deebo Samuel, Terry McLaurin

TE David Njoku

Left Knee PCL Sprain: Likely to miss multiple weeks, could land on IR

Njoku injured his knee while catching a TD pass on Sunday against the Titans. He landed hard on the front of his left knee with the knee flexed, which is the classic mechanism of injury for a PCL sprain. Even if this is a mild sprain, Njoku is going to miss multiple games, and given where we are in the calendar, he could land on IR and be done for the season. I do not expect this injury to impact him deep into the off-season or in 2026.",https://s26212.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Daniel-Jones-Achilles.jpg,N,,2025-12-10 04:58:00.717345

T. Higgins is back in concussion protocol, after testing positive for concussion symptoms.

Remember, he misseduh, he had a concussion, was diagnosed with it.

Came back, and in the game against Buffalo, had a couple of massive hits that we all saw.

Yet he remained in the game.

Now, a joint statement from the NFLPA and the NFL tape you see here says T. Higgins was evaluated twice and cleared to play Return after the game.

In discussion with club medical personnel.

Part of a postgame evaluation, he notified the team he was experiencing symptoms and was Immediately placed in the concussion protocol.

I don't understand what's wrong with the protocol they took after the game to Figure it out.

We all saw it.

And this is the world that we now live in, where there are a million cameras watching every Single play in every football game.

That's why immediate review is so crucial.

Huge part of how NFL games are broadcast now, because they realized fans at home We were seeing something that the refs needed to be aware of.

At what point do we also acknowledge that fans at home saw T. Higgins repeatedly.

Grab his head.

We saw T. Higgins repeatedly point to it.

We saw a violent hit on the sidelines where his head bounced off the ground in the minute he Sat up, he grabbed his helmet.

Now, he stayed in the game; every time they, They checked him; they cleared him.

And I dont know what the protocol is.

Allowed him to get back in the game because to me, it seems fishy at best.

And for so many of us, Im the farthest thing from a conspiracy theorist, So many of us will look at it, though, and say, Well, why was he back in the game?

My question is, what's wrong with the protocol that we all saw him physically react Multiple times, hits to the head where his head bounced off the ground.

We all saw it.

We saw his hands; we saw him reach for his head.

What is wrong with the protocol we all saw This happened in real time, and nothing was caught Until after the game?

The most important thing here is T. Higgins Get healthy.

And once you've had multiple concussions, This short proximity, suddenly we're gonna wonder about your health moving forward.

Those are all fair questions to ask.

The most important thing we want is for T Higgins is getting healthy now.

But also on top of all that, The NFL needs to look in the mirror this offseason and figure out what's wrong Their protocol, that somebody so clearly bothered, was examined multiple times, An independent neurologist allowed him to come back in the game.

Again, I'm not screaming conspiracy theory.

“I don’t think it’s going to jeopardize his availability at all,” Tomlin said.

Eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback Philip Rivers ended his retirement and signed with the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad today in a surprise move for the 44-year-old. Rivers last played an NFL game for the Colts on Jan. 9, 2021 in a wild-card loss to the Buffalo Bills.

The Colts started the season 8-2 before their Week 11 bye. They've dropped three games in a row since and lost starting quarterback Daniel Jones to a season-ending Achilles injury against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 14.

To add injury to injury, third-string quarterback Riley Leonard also suffered a knee injury during Week 14 when he entered the game for Jones.

It's unclear whether Rivers will get the start in Week 15 against the Tennessee Titans. He worked out for the team yesterday and ""threw the ball well"" on his 44th birthday. If Leonard isn't able to go, the Colts may rely on Rivers - who is in his first year as a Hall of Fame semifinalist.

With a start, he'd be the latest notable quarterback to un-retire and take the field once again. Here are three examples of that happening in the last 20 years:

NFL QBs to come out of retirement

Teddy Bridgewater

The former first-round pick spent the first four years of his career in Minnesota with the Vikings before bouncing around to New Orleans (2018-19), Carolina (2020), Denver (2021), Miami (2022) and Detroit (2023). After his lone season with the Lions, Bridgewater decided to hang up his cleats in December of that season.

He spent a calendar year away from the NFL and won a state championship with his alma mater, Miami Northwestern High School, before reuniting with the Lions late in the 2024 season. Detroit was hit hard by injuries all year and Bridgewater came on as veteran insurance at the most important position.

He's stuck around, though, and is currently the backup in Tampa Bay for Baker Mayfield.

Tom Brady

The future Pro Football Hall of Famer flirted briefly with retirement in February 2022 after a second season with the Buccaneers. It wasn't for a drop-off in performance; he'd set a career-high in passing yards with 5,316 and led the NFL in touchdowns with 43 in 2021.

His retirement was ultimately short-lived. Brady needed just 40 days to decide he wanted back in and returned to the Buccaneers for the 2022 NFL season. His return wasn't as triumphant as the previous two years; Tampa Bay went 8-9, giving him his lone losing season as a starter in the NFL. Brady retired again - this time for good - in February 2023 and transitioned immediately to the broadcast booth.

Brett Favre

NFL fans under the age of 27 may not remember the annual offseason drama that was Favre's retirement decision. The three-time MVP and Hall of Famer mulled retirement on a yearly basis in the late 2000s. His future was in doubt after the 2006 season but he ultimately returned to the Green Bay Packers for the 2007 season. On March 4, 2008, he retired for the first time.

Four months later, he wanted to return to the team but Green Bay did not grant him an unconditional release. The Packers eventually traded him to the New York Jets for a 2009 draft pick. Favre led he league in interceptions and went 9-7 as a starter.

He had a resurgent season in 2009 with the Minnesota Vikings. He nearly made the Super Bowl, falling in the NFC championship game to the eventual champion Saints on a late interception. Favre returned in 2010 and went 5-8 as a starter before officially filing his retirement papers in January 2011.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/09/USAT/87690934007-usatsi-15453184.jpg?crop=4262,2398,x0,y319&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-10 00:59:54.215764

The next three games will be a step up in difficulty for Sanders and the Cleveland offense, made more difficult by injuries that are setting up a look at the future.

On Tuesday, the Browns made six moves on their roster with at least two more to come:

Placed OL Ethan Pocic, RB Jerome Ford (shoulder) on injured reserve

Released DE Ochaun Mathis and LB Mark Robinson from the practice squad

Signed OL Darrian Dalcourt and DT Keith Cooper Jr. to the practice squad

As noted in the team’s press release, Dalcourt, a center, was undrafted in 2024 and played on three different practice squads, while Cooper was undrafted this year and spent time with the Detroit Lions.

Neither has seen an NFL snap.

But they're also in the midst of a four-game stretch against teams fighting for postseason position.

On Sunday, Dec. 14, the Packers travel to Denver to face the Broncos, owners of the best record in the AFC (11-2) after defeating the Las Vegas Raiders last week.

Like the Packers, the Broncos are battling for the top seed in their conference with the New England Patriots, who are also 11-2. Denver has won 10 straight games, its longest winning streak since it won the Super Bowl with Peyton Manning in 2012.

However, oddsmakers are apparently more impressed with the Packers. They opened as 2.5-point favorites on the road. Part of the reason might be that eight of the Broncos' 10 victories in their streak have come by one score or less and six have been by three points or less.

The Packers and Broncos have two of the better defenses in the NFL, with the Packers allowing 285 yards a game and 24 touchdowns and the Broncos allowing 296 yards a game and 20 touchdowns.

Packers injury update

Wide receiver Jayden Reed and linebacker Quay Walker returned to action against the Bears. Reed finished with four catches for 31 yards.

Wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks, who's battling an ankle injury, is day-to-day, according to coach Matt LaFleur.

Wicks should have a chance to test his ankle this week before the team decides whether he can play in Denver.

“We’ll see how he progresses,” LaFleur said, “but certainly we need him out there. He’s a guy who, you can see it early in the routes that he was running, there was one in particular – it might’ve been the first play of the game – where (Bears cornerback) Jaylon Johnson is pressed on him, and his ability to get a guy to move off the spot is pretty impressive.”

Who Will Win The AFC Championship? Top Contenders

Here are our top three AFC Championship contenders as the season reaches Week 15. AFC Championship winner payouts courtesy of PrizePicks Team Picks, where you can pick which team you think will win the AFC Championship and earn money if your picks are right!

#3: New England Patriots (11-2)

AFC Championship Winner Payout via PrizePicks Team Picks: 4.16x Yes | 1.2x No

The New England Patriots (11-2) are the AFC’s biggest surprise. They became the first team to reach 11 wins this season and lead the AFC East ahead of Buffalo, returning to the glory days — but will that success follow them in the playoffs?

Second-year QB Drake Maye has fueled the turnaround with an MVP-caliber season — throwing for 3,412 yards (second in NFL) and 23 TDs with a league-best 71.5% completion rate.

New England’s offense ranks top-10 in scoring (27.0 PPG) and total yards (362.6 YPG), while its defense allows just 18.5 PPG and 296.4 YPG.

Despite their regular-season dominance, playoff inexperience keeps the Patriots behind more seasoned contenders. Maye could erase those doubts in January, but for now, they remain a tier below the AFC’s elite.

{{nfl_offer_banner=""/style-system/ui-components-playbook""}}

#2: Denver Broncos (11-2)

AFC Championship Winner Payout via PrizePicks Team Picks: 4.34x Yes | 1.17x No

Head coach Sean Payton has engineered a stunning turnaround in Denver. The Broncos (11–2) have gone from a 5–12 team just two seasons ago to a legitimate Super Bowl contender.

Broncos QB Bo Nix has validated Payton’s faith, producing 2,954 passing yards and 19 TDs while mastering the system with rare poise. Denver is 9–2 in one-score games, a mark that speaks to its resilience.

Behind their second-year QB, the Broncos average 23.7 points and 342 yards per game, while the defense ranks among the NFL’s best, allowing just 18.1 PPG and 282.0 YPG. Broncos edge rushers Nik Bonitto and Jonathon Cooper have combined for 20 sacks, leading a defense that tops the league with 55 sacks.

With Payton’s postseason experience and a balanced roster, the Broncos are built like a team poised for a deep playoff run.

#1: Buffalo Bills (9-4)

AFC Championship Winner Payout via PrizePicks Team Picks: 4.16x Yes | 1.19x No

The Buffalo Bills (9-4) enter December as the AFC’s most dangerous team. Despite trailing New England in the East, they boast a 96% playoff probability and remain in position to take the AFC East crown and seize home-field advantage.

Bills QB Josh Allen is having one of his best seasons — posting 3,083 passing yards, 487 rushing yards, and 34 total TDs while completing 70.1% of his throws.

Buffalo’s offense is the conference’s most explosive, averaging 28.9 PPG and 383.7 YPG. The offensive line ranks top-two in both pass-block (73%) and run-block (74%) win rates, giving Allen the protection and balance needed to thrive.

Defensively, the Bills allow just 22.5 PPG and 307 YPG with steady takeaway production (1.3 per game). Under head coach Sean McDermott, Buffalo’s consistency and postseason experience make it the team to beat in the AFC.

Here are five things to know about the Packers' new defensive linemen: Both are former NFL draft picks.
Bohanna played his first two NFL seasons for former Packers coach Mike McCarthy in Dallas and was teammates with current Green Bay cornerback Carrington Valentine at Kentucky.
Riley played at four different colleges.
A native of New Bern, N.C., Riley played one season at North Carolina before transferring to Garden City (Kan.) Community College in 2019.","GREEN BAY – With Devonte Wyatt out with a season-ending ankle injury, the Packers have beefed up the defensive line with the addition of veterans Quinton Bohanna and Jordon Riley.

Bohanna (6-4, 327) has recorded 42 tackles (three for loss) in 39 career games (13 starts) over five NFL seasons spent in Dallas, Detroit, Tennessee and Seattle. The Packers claimed him off waivers from the Seahawks on Saturday.

Riley (6-5, 338) has racked up 20 tackles (four for loss) in 22 games (five starts) after spending his first 2½ seasons with the New York Giants. He joined Green Bay last week after the Packers signed him off the Giants' practice squad.

""Devonte was doing a heck of a job just playing with great fundamentals, great technique and he's one of our better run defenders,"" said Head Coach Matt LaFleur on Monday.

""So just to add a little bit more beef on our D-line, we thought that was an important part. Each week it's gonna be a competition in terms of who's gonna be the guys out there playing.""

Here are five things to know about the Packers' new defensive linemen:

Both are former NFL draft picks.

The Cowboys selected Bohanna in the sixth round (192nd overall) of the 2021 NFL Draft.

Most of Bohanna's NFL playing time came during his two years in Dallas, where he recorded 29 tackles in 27 games with 10 starts before being cut at the end of training camp in 2023.

The Giants took Riley in the seventh round (243) of the 2023 NFL Draft. The 27-year-old defensive lineman started five of the 12 games he played for New York last year.

Riley didn't make the Giants' 53-man roster this past summer but signed to the practice squad the day after final cuts.

Bohanna is known as a space-eating, run-stuffer.

A former team captain at Kentucky, ""Big Bo"" is a massive defensive tackle who played in the 350-pound range while racking up 45 tackles and two sacks over 45 collegiate games with 31 starts.

A former three-star recruit, Bohanna was a finalist for the Tennessee Class 6A Mr. Football award in 2016 after recording 91 tackles (24 for loss) as a senior at Cordova (Tenn.) High School.

The 26-year-old defensive lineman's prodigious size for a nose tackle shot Bohanna onto NFL radars in 2021. Leading up to the draft, NFL.com's Lance Zierlein lauded Bohanna as a ""two-gapping nose with good power"" with the ability to ""man the nose in even or odd fronts and plays with decent knock-back explosiveness coming off the ball.""

Riley works out with Colby Wooden during the offseason.

Along with Giants' All-Pro defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence, Riley and Wooden trained with defensive line performance coach Mark Hall in South Carolina the past two summers.

The Packers' defensive lineman had a smile on his face when he learned during a meeting last week the team added Riley, who played 14 snaps in Sunday's 28-21 win over Chicago.

""Jordon's a heavy-handed guy,"" Wooden said. ""He comes from the Giants, where they played a lot of shade, a lot of zero (technique). They've done a lot of different things. For him to come in, it's going to be an easy transition I feel like. He's a get-along guy. He goes along. He doesn't cause any (issues). For us, he's going to be great. He's going to fit right in with us.""

Riley understands his value on early downs and makes it his priority to stop the run. Like Wooden, Riley was equally excited to have a fresh start in Green Bay.

""I'm blessed bro. Excited. Just excited, man,"" said Riley last week. ""Watching TV at home, then getting a call from my agent telling me I got (signed). Man, never moved so fast in my life. Opportunity just to be around some winning culture, man. Something in the tradition here, bro, I was doing some research and just all the things that happened here.""

Bohanna has several ties to the Packers, as well.

Bohanna was draft classmates with current Packers pass rusher Micah Parsons, whom the Cowboys selected in the first round (12th overall) in 2021.

Bohanna played his first two NFL seasons for former Packers coach Mike McCarthy in Dallas and was teammates with current Green Bay cornerback Carrington Valentine at Kentucky.

Bohanna played for Arden Duren in both Seattle and Dallas. Now serving as the Seahawks' defensive coordinator, Duren is a longtime NFL assistant coach whom Head Coach Matt LaFleur holds in high esteem after the two worked together in Atlanta.

Bohanna's uncle, Brian Ingram, also was a former linebacker for the New England Patriots and San Diego Chargers in the 1980s.

Riley played at four different colleges.

A native of New Bern, N.C., Riley played one season at North Carolina before transferring to Garden City (Kan.) Community College in 2019.

Riley spent his junior year at Nebraska, recording seven tackles (one for loss) in 10 games, before finishing his college career at Oregon, where he was teammates with Bennett Williams, the older brother of Packers safety Evan Williams.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/eg8u5u7yhavd77jlscva,N,,2025-12-09 22:00:23.037586

The Colts reportedly signed Philip Rivers after both their starting and backup quarterbacks were injured on the weekend.

The 44-year-old Rivers retired four years ago and recently became a grandfather, while also coaching at a high school.

What's next?

Indianapolis's season is on the line with four games left in the regular season, before playoffs start January 11.

The Indianapolis Colts have bolstered their injury-depleted quarterback corps by bringing 44-year-old Philip Rivers out of retirement and signing him to the practice squad, a person with knowledge of the deal has told The Associated Press.

The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team had not yet made an official announcement.

The move came less than 24 hours after Colts coach Shane Steichen confirmed Indy's starter, Daniel Jones, would miss the rest of this season after tearing his right Achilles tendon, and backup Riley Leonard injured his right knee during the weekend's loss at Jacksonville.

Rivers — who has 10 children and recently became a grandfather — has not taken a snap since finishing his career with a playoff loss following the Colts 2020 season. That was the last time the Colts (8-5) made the post-season.

The eight-time Pro Bowler announced his retirement in January 2021 and has been coaching St Michael High School in Fairhope, Alabama, ever since.

But it is not clear how long it will take Rivers to learn Indy's playbook — or work his way into game shape — as the reeling Colts try to snap a three-game losing streak next weekend at Seattle (10-3).

""Things happen. Wacky stuff has happened in this league. Your depth gets tested, your resolve gets tested as you get thrown into some adversity as a unit, as a coaching staff, as a position group,"" offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter said, declining to take specific questions about Rivers.

""We've been through some fire out there, but our coaching staff's excited to draw a plan up and teach it.""

Rivers rejoins a team desperately trying to rebound from its worst stretch of the season, four losses in five games. Indy has fallen out of the race for the AFC's top seed and is tied for second in the AFC South with Houston (8-5), one game behind division leader Jacksonville (9-4).

Rivers ranked among the NFL's career leaders in yards passing with 63,440, 421 touchdown passes, and 12 4,000-yard seasons when he retired.

NFL Network reported that the Colts could sign Rivers – who last played in the 2020 season – to the practice squad. Since his retirement he has coached high school football. This season he led St Michael Catholic Cardinals in his native Alabama to the Class 4A state semi-finals.

Daniel Jones, who was enjoying a resurgence in his first season with the Colts, suffered a season-ending torn achilles in Sunday’s 36-19 loss at Jacksonville. Backup Riley Leonard, who replaced Jones, is dealing with a knee injury, although the 2025 sixth-round draft pick is expected to make the start at Seattle on Sunday. Former first-round pick Anthony Richardson suffered a broken orbital bone in October and has not been medically cleared to return. Veteran Brett Rypien is on the Colts’ practice squad.

“Things happen, wacky stuff has happened in this league, your depth gets tested, your resolve gets tested as you get thrown into some adversity as a unit, as a coaching staff, as a position group,” Colts offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter said on Tuesday, declining to take specific questions about Rivers. “We’ve been through some fire out there, but our coaching staff’s excited to draw a plan up and teach it.”

The Colts looked set for the postseason when they topped the AFC South with an 8-2 record, but have since lost three games in a row and are just outside the final playoff place in the AFC.

The Colts’ remaining schedule is tough as they face four teams who look set for the postseason: the Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars and Texans. However, ESPN reports that the team believe Rivers would give them a chance at making the postseason.

After playing 16 seasons with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers, Rivers completed his career with the Colts in 2020. He threw for more than 4,000 yards for the 12th time in 13 seasons, tossing 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions as the Colts made the playoffs before narrowly losing to the Buffalo Bills in the wildcard round.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f05a9fbfa7d05e9d683ddc692674c7e71f3993ed/458_0_2280_1825/master/2280.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b75fde1312e9543eae5fdef9b382c3db",N,,2025-12-09 22:00:26.217121

“Broken But Never Beaten,” Ertz wrote, including an image of himself in his No. 86 uniform with a prayer.

His wife, Julie Ertz — an American retired soccer star and two-time Women’s World Cup Champion — reshared his message to her Instagram Story.

Ertz was injured when he tried to reel in a pass from Marcus Mariota, Washington’s backup quarterback, and took a hit from Minnesota defensive back Jay Ward in the third quarter.

The 35-year-old, who’s in his 13th NFL season, was visibly emotional while being carted off with his leg in a brace.

Ertz played 34 snaps and had one catch on two targets for 11 yards before exiting the game in what would be Washington’s eighth straight loss.

Star Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels left Sunday’s game with a left elbow injury shortly before Ertz did.

Head coach Dan Quinn told reporters after the game that Daniels was held out for precautionary reasons and could have gone back in.

Daniels dislocated that same elbow in Week 9 and missed three games. He returned Sunday against the Vikings.

Ertz tallied 50 catches for 504 yards and four touchdowns in his second season with Washington.

The former Super Bowl champion tight end’s future is up in the air after he signed a one-year contract with the Commanders for this season, with retirement a possibility.

The big name who will be on the injury report this week is receiver CeeDee Lamb, who is doing better as he endures concussion protocol. Tackle Tyler Guyton also seems to be trending toward playing Sunday night against the Minnesota Vikings. The bad news for Dallas is that Cowboys killer Aaron Jones also looks to be healthy and ready for another go at his favorite childhood team.

As for Trevon Diggs, he is set to return to practice, which will help determine his availability. Here is what Dallas is doing.

CeeDee Lamb injury report

The news continues to be encouraging as star receiver CeeDee Lamb goes through concussion protocol following his injury sustained Thursday against Detroit.

“He’s doing good,” coach Brian Schottenheimer said, via the team website. “Talked to him over the weekend. He’s progressing nicely, and hopefully things work out like we expect.”

The extra days Dallas gets coming off a Thursday game will help. At this point he rates as questionable for the Minnesota game.

Tyler Guyton injury update

Dallas offensive tackle Tyler Guyton, their No. 1 pick last year, injured his ankle in the Week 12 win over Philadelphia and is close to returning.

Jerry Jones said Friday on his radio show that the he’s optimistic Guyton will play against Minnesota.

""My thoughts are that he'll be available,"" Jones said. ""That's Dr. Jones (talking), and I know how you need to take that information. But the bottom line is my opinion is he'll be there.""

Schottenheimer was less rosy when asked about Guyton and defensive end Jadeveon Clowney.

“We will find out a little bit more over the next two days, 48 hours,” Schottenheimer said of their availability for Sunday Night Football.

Trevon Diggs Dallas Cowboys

Dallas’ cornerback Trevon Diggs, who has missed much of this season after suffering a concussion in his home, is set to return to full practice this week and how that goes will determine his availability for Sunday night’s game with Minnesota.

”I know who I am, I know what I can do on the field. I’m going to put that out there, I’m going to show them,” Diggs told the team’s website recently.

Dallas Cowboys next game

Dallas running back Javonte Williams hit a milestone against Detroit, as he went over 1,000 yards for the first time in his five-year career. He now has 1,022 yards on 215 rushes with nine touchdowns. He also has 33 receptions this year for 128 yards and two touchdowns.

The previous best year of his career was his rookie year of 2021 when he had 903 rushing yards for the Denver Broncos.

Aaron Jones injury update

Minnesota Vikings tailback Aaron Jones, a UTEP alum, has dealt with some injuries this year, most recently with a hamstring, but is healthy now. He had 14 rushes for 76 yards in the Vikings 31-0 win over Minnesota.

Jake Ferguson kettle jump

The NFL finally got around to assessing fines for Dallas’ Thanksgiving Day win against Kansas City, and a big surprise is that tight end Jake Ferguson wasn’t given one. After an apparent touchdown that was later overturned on review, Ferguson did the now somewhat traditional leap into the Salvation Army kettle.

In a departure from this tradition, the NFL didn’t give him a fine. The big kettle is considered a prop and props are illegal to use in celebrations.

In other news from the game,

Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco was fined $46,371 for illegal helmet use on Cowboys CB DaRon Bland, while Cowboys DB Markquese Bell was fined $11,593 for a facemask.

Philip Rivers will sign a deal with the Colts to join their practice squad after having a workout with the team on Tuesday, ESPN reported. The reported news of Rivers' signing comes two days after Daniel Jones suffered an Achilles tear in the Colts' loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Rivers, who turned 44 on Monday, spent the final season of his 17-year NFL career with the Colts in 2020. He joined them after spending the first 16 years of his career with the Chargers.

Rivers helped the Colts reach the playoffs in his lone season with the team, and Indianapolis is seeking to make its first playoff appearance since that season. The Colts appeared primed to make the playoffs earlier this season behind Jones' surprise play, but they dropped to 8-5 with Sunday's loss and are currently out of the AFC playoff picture.

The Colts' quarterback injuries go beyond Jones. Backup Anthony Richardson is still sidelined due to an eye injury. Rookie Riley Leonard relieved Jones after he suffered the injury in the first quarter on Sunday, but he's dealing with a knee injury. The Colts also have veteran Brett Rypien on their practice squad.

Rivers will support Leonard in the quarterbacks' room for now, but could serve as an option to start sometime down the final stretch of the regular season, according to NFL Media.

Rivers had one of the NFL's most decorated careers at quarterback since the turn of the century. He was named a Pro Bowler eight times in his career, ranking fifth all-time in passing yards and touchdowns at the time of his retirement following the 2020 season.

Rivers was also named a semifinalist for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of the Class of 2026 in November.

Sundell was replaced by Olu Oluwatimi, whose own injury issues during training camp might have been a factor in Sundell winning the starting center job.

It should be noted that Sundell received snaps at right guard in training camp and preseason. Anthony Bradford has had his ups and downs throughout his season and career, but his pass blocking has been very sturdy in recent weeks.

If not right guard in lieu of Bradford, would Sundell replace Oluwatimi and become the starting center again? Macdonald wouldn’t give any definitive answer on plans for Sundell.

Meanwhile, it’s a different story for tight end Elijah Arroyo. He left Seattle’s 37-9 win over the Atlanta Falcons with a knee injury after he was targeted on Sam Darnold’s interception.

“Elijah’s got a knee,” Macdonald said. “Just working through it right now, but I’d say this week’s probably in jeopardy for him.”

Arroyo has appeared in every game this season but the second-round rookie has just two catches over the last five weeks.

Josh Allen and Christian Benford draw praise from coaching staff

Buffalo's thrilling 39-34 win over Cincinnati included superstar performances from quarterback Josh Allen and CB Christian Benford.

In the second half, Allen completed 13 of 15 (87%) passes for 155 yards and two touchdowns. He added 79 rushing yards and a touchdown as well, helping the Bills comeback from two separate double-digit deficits, including down 28-18 with under eight minutes remaining.

""He's just got this 'it' factor that is hard to question and hard to defend. So it's just a special quality that not a lot of people have, not a lot of players, not a lot of performers have,"" head coach Sean McDermott said.

OC Joe Brady praised Allen and the entire offensive operation for bearing down and sticking together throughout the game.

""When you have Josh Allen at quarterback, as long as there's time on the clock, you're going to be able to score points. The game's not over,"" Brady said.

One week after rushing 51 times for a season-high 249 yards in Pittsburgh, the Bills were explosive in both facets of the game against another AFC North team. Buffalo netted six explosive gains of 15+ yards in the passing game and five in the run game.

""We want to be able to show that we can win different ways and different styles of games,"" Brady said. ""Finding ways to win football games is the most important thing right now, and showing that we can do it in different ways I think is equally as important.""

Cornerback Christian Benford recorded a takeaway and a defensive touchdown for the second consecutive games, turning the tide in favor of the Bills with his 63-yard interception return for a touchdown to give Buffalo a 32-28 lead with just over five minutes remaining.

Benford is the only player in the league this season with two INTs, two sacks and two defensive touchdowns.

""He's just a pro, and he wants to be really good. He works at it, that's just who 'CB' is,"" DC Bobby Babich shared. ""If you were to tell me (before the season) he's gonna have a couple defensive touchdowns, it wouldn't shock me.""

What to expect from Darnell Savage

The Bills claimed safety Darnell Savage off waivers prior to Week 14. McDermott confirmed the 28-year-old has reported to Buffalo and the 28-year-old joins the active roster this week.

""Had a conversation with him this morning. He's a guy that we've had our eye on,"" McDermott said.

At this time of year, any addition made to the roster is done so with the goal of helping the team win games. What Savage's role will be is still being fine-tuned.

Philadelphia Eagles @ Los Angeles Chargers

Omarion Hampton returns for the Chargers: The Chargers' first-round rookie was activated off injured reserve after last playing in Week 5.

Hampton began the year as Los Angeles’ lead running back, playing 77.9% of offensive snaps over the first four weeks. He was an every-down back, taking at least 72% of snaps in all situations, including 100% of the goal-line and two-minute drill snaps. He suffered an ankle injury in Week 5, which led to his placement on injured reserve. He was limited in practice on Thursday but practiced in full on Friday and Saturday, leading to his activation on Monday.

Najee Harris began the year as the backup and Hassan Haskins as the third-string back. Harris is out for the season, and Haskins also missed most of the games Hampton missed with a hamstring injury. Haskins was similarly limited on Thursday, practiced in full on Friday and Saturday, and was activated as well.

They joined Kimani Vidal, who started the year on the practice squad but was activated once Harris landed on injured reserve. Vidal played 71.6% of snaps from Weeks 6–11, taking at least 62% of snaps in all situations. With three healthy running backs, Los Angeles waived Jaret Patterson to clear a roster spot.

The Chargers used Hampton and Vidal in a frequent rotation, with each back taking only a few snaps at a time before the other subbed in. Haskins wasn’t involved on offense. There was a general tendency to use Hampton in run situations and Vidal in pass situations, though the split wasn’t as defined as most backfields. As the game progressed, the team leaned more on Vidal, with the second-year back dominating snaps in the fourth quarter when Los Angeles started playing from behind. Vidal caught a 60-yard pass on the opening drive, while Hampton scored a touchdown on that same drive — plays that accounted for most of their fantasy production.

There is a chance the Chargers were easing Hampton back in, but Vidal played well enough during his time as the starter that this could simply remain a two-man backfield for the rest of the season. Los Angeles has a tough matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs next week, followed by a favorable one against the Dallas Cowboys, and then finishes with another difficult game against the Houston Texans. Both running backs could be considered flex plays next week, but expectations should be tempered, as neither is likely to match the fantasy production from their peak usage weeks.

The Chargers adjust their tight end rotation: Will Dissly served as the Chargers' backup tight end, marking his first game since Week 7.

Los Angeles started the season with Will Dissly and Tyler Conklin as its top two tight ends, with Oronde Gadsden and Tucker Fisk serving as healthy inactives for the first two games. Dissly suffered a knee injury, which led Gadsden to emerge as the Chargers’ receiving tight end, while Dissly regained his role as the run-blocking tight end, similar to last season. Dissly returned in Week 6 and was part of a temporary three-man rotation.

From Weeks 8–13, Gadsden played 72.0% of the offensive snaps, primarily in 11 and 12 personnel. Fisk played 40.9% of snaps in 12 and 21 personnel, and Conklin logged 9.8% as a backup to both players, while Dissly has been a healthy inactive.

Fisk suffered an ankle injury last week, which kept him out of practice. He was placed on injured reserve, opening the door for one of the Chargers’ veterans to handle the 12 and 21 personnel roles. Los Angeles chose Dissly. They made Conklin inactive, which freed up a roster spot for another position. In future weeks, it’s at least possible that Conklin will also be active as a backup.

Gadsden’s role was unaffected by the movement among the backup tight ends, with his situational snap rates differing only a few percentage points from his averages over the last two months. He was a top fantasy tight end in October, but he hasn’t been nearly as involved in the Chargers’ passing game over the past month. He had his worst receiving performance of the season with one catch for seven yards. None of their fantasy playoff matchups are favorable, so he likely shouldn’t be in fantasy lineups going forward. Dissly served as a direct replacement for Fisk, as expected.

Jahan Dotson plays a limited role: The Eagles’ third wide receiver has seen his playing time decrease in recent weeks, and he showed up on the injury report this past week.

Dotson has spent the last two seasons as the Eagles’ third wide receiver, playing in three-receiver sets and rarely seeing snaps in two-receiver sets unless there is an injury. He played 90.8% of the team’s 11-personnel snaps over the first 11 weeks and just 9.0% of its 12-personnel snaps, with 14 of his 19 snaps in 12 personnel coming in Week 8 when A.J. Brown was out. His week-to-week playing time has varied entirely based on game script and formation usage.

That trend shifted slightly over the past two weeks, as he played only 75% of the 11-personnel snaps. Undrafted rookie Darius Cooper has taken the remaining 25%, along with a few snaps when Brown or DeVonta Smith needed a break. Cooper entered the game with just two career receptions, while Dotson has made several big plays this season. It seems likely that Dotson has been dealing with an injury, and last week was the first time he appeared on the injury report.

Dotson was limited in practice on Thursday and Friday with a toe injury before practicing in full on Saturday. Cooper again rotated in whenever Dotson came off the field in 11 personnel, taking an even higher percentage of snaps from him than in recent weeks. Cooper caught a 19-yard pass in this game, while Dotson had a three-yard reception.

The split between Dotson and Cooper won’t matter for most fantasy leagues, but it could become much more significant if Brown or Smith suffers an injury in the coming weeks.

Miscellaneous Notes

Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert was limited all week with a left hand injury that required surgery and was questionable, but he was ultimately active.

Los Angeles wide receiver Quentin Johnston was limited in practice on Thursday with a shoulder injury.

The Chargers activated wide receiver Dalevon Campbell from the practice squad, only for him to be inactive. While it’s common to see this when a player is elevated on Saturday as injury insurance and the starter ends up being active, it’s rare for someone to be elevated and inactive on the same day. With the Los Angeles wide receiver room relatively healthy, the move was even more unusual.

Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts threw an interception, recovered a fumble and fumbled the recovery on the same play. He is the first player with two turnovers on one play since 1978, according to Elias Sports Bureau.

Saquon Barkley recorded seven rushing touchdowns of 50 or more yards over the regular and postseason last year. He accomplished this once over the first 13 weeks and scored his second touchdown of 50 or more yards in this game.

The Eagles waived wide receiver Xavier Gipson on Monday. Gipson was primarily a returner, with only nine snaps on offense for the Eagles. Last week, Philadelphia turned to Britain Covey and running back Will Shipley as their kick and punt returners, making Gipson expendable.

Table Notes

• Snaps include plays called back due to penalties, including offensive holding or defensive pass interference. The other three stats have these plays removed.

• Targets may differ from official NFL sources. The most likely discrepancy would be from a clear thrown-away pass, where the NFL may give the target to the nearest receiver, while this data will not.",https://media.pff.com/2025/12/Barkley-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675,N,,2025-12-09 22:00:48.622985

Indianapolis signed the previously retired quarterback, who last appeared in a game five seasons ago, to its practice squad following Daniel Jones’ season-ending Achilles tear Sunday, according to reports.

Rivers could potentially start a game down the stretch for the Colts (8-5), per NFL Network, with backup Riley Leonard week to week with a knee injury.

Indianapolis is in a desperate spot to save its season following Jones’ injury and potentially turning to Rivers would be one of the wilder NFL storylines in years.

He last played on Jan. 3, 2021 with the Colts, and just celebrated his 44th birthday Monday. Rivers and his wife Tiffany share 10 children together — and their oldest child, Halle, recently gave birth to a son.

Rivers is even a first-time semifinalist or the 2026 Hall of Fame class, and he would lose his eligibility should he sign with the active roster, according to ESPN.

However, the father of 10 apparently still has the itch and participated in a workout Monday and apparently showed enough that the team inked him to the practice squad.

ESPN further noted that a source said Rivers threw the ball well.

He’s now in line to potentially start a game, although expecting him to start Sunday in Seattle against the 10-3 Seahawks would be daunting task.

Rivers reportedly has strong knowledge of the Colts’ offensive system under coach Shane Steichen, and the team hopes that could pay dividends in this playoff push.

That Rivers is even in this spot is due to a chaotic chain of events that has left the Colts vulnerable at the sport’s most important position.

Jones was enjoying a revival season before dealing with injuries recently, including a left fibula stress fracture, and then tearing his right Achilles this past week against the Jaguars.

Leonard replaced Jones and completed 18 of 29 passes with one interception, but he suffered strained knee ligament, per ESPN.

Former starter Anthony Richardson landed on injured reserve after suffering an orbital fracture before an October game.

Journeyman Brett Rypien is also on the team’s practice squad.

The Colts are also scrambling since a season that seemed like it could potentially result in a Super Bowl berth amid an 8-2 start now may end without a postseason berth.

Indianapolis sits on the outside of the AFC playoff picture after losing Sunday to the Jaguars, its third straight loss and fourth in five games, although they have the same record as the Texans.

Starting quarterback Daniel Jones will miss the rest of the 2025 season with a torn right Achilles, Colts coach Shane Steichen announced Monday. Jones will undergo surgery this week. The veteran suffered the non-contact injury while throwing a pass near the end of the first quarter of Sunday’s 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.

“Obviously, just really feel for him. Just an unfortunate situation,” Steichen said of Jones. “The work that he puts in, the effort on a day-to-day basis, the grind, a team captain for us — just very unfortunate. One of the toughest guys I’ve been around. So, just praying for a speedy recovery.”

Jones ended his season with 3,101 passing yards and 19 touchdowns against eight interceptions in 13 games. His 68.0 completion percentage is tied with Philip Rivers (2020) for the second highest in Colts history for a single season, trailing only Hall of Famer Peyton Manning’s 68.8 percent in 2009. Jones also totaled 45 carries for 164 yards and five touchdowns on the ground.

The loss of Jones deals a major blow to the Colts’ already dwindling playoff hopes. Following Sunday’s defeat, which was their third straight, the Colts’ odds to make the playoffs dropped to 30 percent, per The Athletic’s NFL Playoff Simulator, powered by Austin Mock’s NFL Projection Model. Their odds to win the AFC South for the first time since 2014 plummeted to 3 percent.

That’s Indy’s new reality without a proven backup to replace Jones. Anthony Richardson Sr., the 2023 No. 4 pick, began the season as the Colts’ QB2 and could have been a viable option, since he’s 8-7 as a starter. However, he is still on injured reserve due to an orbital fracture he suffered during a pregame warmup accident in Week 6.

Steichen said Monday that Richardson would not be activated off IR this week, thus ruling him out of Sunday’s game at the Seattle Seahawks. Last week, Steichen said Richardson was “doing some stuff in the weight room,” but he still hasn’t been cleared for on-field football activities.

“Obviously, anytime you’re dealing with an eye, you want to make sure he’s got full vision in that eye,” Steichen said last week. “He’s resting it right now, and once he’s cleared to go, I’ll let you guys know.”

With Jones set to join Richardson on IR, the Colts will put their season in the hands of sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard. That’s the first option anyway, according to Steichen, who said Monday that “the hope” is for Leonard to make his first NFL start Sunday. However, Steichen added that Leonard’s status is unclear since he suffered a right knee injury at Jacksonville.

If Leonard is unable to play, the Colts’ only other healthy QB is Brett Rypien, whom Indy signed in October after placing Richardson on IR. The 29-year-old NFL journeyman is 2-2 as a starter, and he last started for the Los Angeles Rams in 2023. He has thrown four TDs against nine picks in 11 games.

Asked if Rypien would start Sunday in place of an injured Leonard, Steichen was noticeably noncommittal, perhaps leaving the door open to sign another QB.

“Yeah, we’ll see how it goes,” Steichen said. “I mean, right now, that’ll be the guy that’s on our roster. So, like I said, we’re working through those situations right now.”

Despite Rypien’s edge in experience, the Colts still would like to play Leonard, who offers more versatility and upside as a dual-threat QB. Leonard was solid in his extended run Sunday, at least given the challenging circumstances. The 23-year-old rookie finished the game 18 of 29 passing for 145 yards with one interception. He also added a 6-yard rushing TD for his first NFL score. Before Sunday, the Notre Dame product had logged just six snaps and two pass attempts (zero completions).

“(With) more reps, obviously, the better it’s gonna be,” wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. said. “Coming into this game, I could probably count on my hand how many first-team reps that Riley’s taken. So, just the fact he was able to fill in and play well shows the potential in him, and we’re just gonna try to support him every way we can.”

Still, asking a late-round rookie to save Indianapolis’ season is a tall order, especially considering the treacherous stretch that awaits. After facing the 10-3 Seahawks, the Colts play host to the San Francisco 49ers (9-4) on “Monday Night Football” in Week 16. Indianapolis will close its season with back-to-back AFC South matchups against the Jaguars (9-4) at home and the Houston Texans (8-5) on the road.

As Leonard tries to keep the Colts afloat, Jones’ season-ending injury has implications that stretch beyond 2025. After starting the year 7-1, the Colts went all in on this campaign, trading wide receiver AD Mitchell and their next two first-round picks to the New York Jets in exchange for two-time, first-team All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner. Indy general manager Chris Ballard and principal owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon never would have green-lighted that deal if they didn’t fully believe in Jones and expect him to return as the team’s starter next season — either on a new long-term contract or the franchise tag.

Now, nothing is certain. Jones is on a one-year, $14 million deal, and a ruptured Achilles this late in 2025 significantly jeopardizes his ability to play in 2026. The 28-year-old already has a long injury history, including the fractured left fibula he was playing through in recent weeks, a torn ACL in 2023 and neck injuries in 2021 and 2023. Jones’ durability issues could make the Colts, and other teams for that matter, hesitant to tie their immediate future to him.

This is a nightmare scenario for Jones, who had quickly revitalized his career in Indianapolis. A castoff by the New York Giants a season ago, Jones had thrust himself into the early MVP conversation amid the Colts’ 7-1 start. He began the season with 13 touchdown passes against three interceptions, plus four rushing touchdowns, in his first eight games. Jones tapered off over the last month, as did the whole team, but he still seemed to have positioned himself as the face of the franchise’s future. That future is no longer a formality.

The Colts have Richardson under contract in 2026, but after losing the starting job to Jones in training camp, he had to have considered his days in Indianapolis numbered. Could the Colts stand pat and give Richardson another chance to compete for the QB1 title next season? Or will they look for another stopgap veteran and hope he can be as successful as Jones was in this offense?

These are the questions the Colts will be asking in the coming months. The answers may be hard to find.

Ward’s third concussion

Just over two weeks ago, Colts cornerback Charvarius Ward Sr. revealed that he contemplated retirement after suffering two concussions in six weeks.

Now, he has sustained a third concussion in 14 weeks.

Steichen said the veteran came to the team facility Monday with concussion symptoms and has been placed in the league’s protocol. Ward’s latest concussion is especially concerning, considering the scary and lingering effects of his previous one. The 29-year-old suffered his first concussion of the season in Week 1 and only missed one game with what he said felt like a migraine.

Yet, a freak accident during pregame warmups in Week 6, in which Ward and reserve tight end Drew Ogletree accidentally ran into each other, resulted in another, much more severe concussion for Ward. Neither player was wearing a helmet when they collided, and Ward was knocked out on the field.

The Colts ultimately placed Ward on injured reserve before his return in Week 12 against the Kansas City Chiefs, with whom he won the Super Bowl in 2020. Two days before that matchup, Ward detailed his second concussion and explained why it made him nearly walk away from football.

“I was throwing up, getting dizzy. I was getting dizzy for like a month,” Ward said. “That wasn’t normal, so that was like a real-deal traumatic injury for me.”

Steichen said it’s “always concerning when you have that many concussions” in a season. Whether Ward plays again this year remains unclear.

Indianapolis signed Ward, a 2023 second-team All-Pro with the San Francisco 49ers, to a three-year, $60 million deal in free agency. Over the last two years, though, he’s struggled to stay healthy while also publicly and candidly grieving the loss of his 23-month-old daughter, Amani Joy, who died in October 2024.

“Happy heavenly birthday AMANI,” Ward wrote in an Instagram post on Nov. 17, which would have been his daughter’s third birthday. “Haven’t been happy since you left us. God was wrong for this.”

In addition to Ward, Steichen said Monday that starting right tackle Braden Smith is also in concussion protocol and has a neck injury, and backup cornerback Chris Lammons has a foot injury.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/07164339/GettyImages-2250563352-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-09 19:00:37.193992

How Does Jones’ Injury Impact Contract Talks With The Colts?
If there’s a silver lining in this for the Colts, it’s that Jones’ injury should drastically reduce his market next offseason.
He was expected to be a strong trade candidate in the spring, but Jones’ injury likely changes that outlook.","In a devastating blow for the Indianapolis Colts, starting QB Daniel Jones tore his Achilles early in Sunday’s loss to the Jaguars, ending his season. Jones was already playing through a fractured fibula in his other leg, and though he wasn’t playing quite as well on it, he was gutting it out for his team.

His injury leaves the Colts at 8-5, currently outside looking in at an extremely competitive AFC playoff picture when just weeks ago they were 8-2 and vying for a first-round bye. Jones’ injury doesn’t just wreck this year, though. One torn Achilles turned what was a clear path forward for the Colts upside down. After trading two first-round picks for CB Sauce Gardner at the trade deadline with the intention of signing Jones to a long-term deal this offseason, Indianapolis finds itself at an unexpected and unwelcome crossroads. What will the Colts do?

What’s Next For Indy This Year?

With former first-round QB Anthony Richardson on IR, the Colts were forced to turn to sixth-round QB Riley Leonard against the Jags, to predictably poor results. Leonard would seem to be the one to finish out the season, except now he’s also dealing with a knee injury. Brett Rypien is on the team’s practice squad and is the only other quarterback on the roster. Even if Leonard was healthy, expect Indianapolis to add someone to their quarterback room in the short term.

The options for the Colts on the free agent market are extremely limited, as you might expect in December. Desmond Ridder spent some time with the Colts during minicamp early in the offseason, so he has a little experience with the team. Dorian Thompson-Robinson and Taylor Heinicke are some other options with relatively recent playing experience. The Colts are working out 44-year-old former QB Philip Rivers, which would be a different kind of Hail Mary to try and save the season. Rivers hasn’t played since 2020.

Alternatively, there are some intriguing options on other teams’ practice squads, including Trevor Siemian, Mike White, Kyle Trask, C.J. Beathard, Adrian Martinez, Sam Ehlinger and Will Grier. The most interesting name on that list is Ehlinger, a fifth-year pro out of Texas who spent the first four years of his career in Indianapolis. He started a couple of games for the Colts back in 2022 and was a valuable part of the organization during his time there, and the coaching staff is already familiar with him.

Players can be signed straight from other practice squads even after the trade deadline has passed, so if the Colts want to bring in Ehlinger (or another quarterback currently sitting on a practice squad) they can do so immediately. Players have to agree but the chance to play that the Colts are offering will be attractive.

As for Richardson, his return timeline is unknown, but it’s possible he could return for the last game or two of the season. At that point, it will likely be too late for Indy to salvage their playoff hopes (the Colts play the Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars, and Texans to close the season), but there would still be a lot on the line for both him and the team as they look ahead to 2026.

What Is Jones’ Recovery Timeline?

The average Achilles rehab takes six to nine months post-surgery. However, this timeline can vary. The foot is placed in a cast for the first couple of weeks after surgery and then for a few weeks after that, rehab involves slowly placing more body weight upon the affected leg as it continues to heal. By six to eight weeks post-op, balance exercises begin, and four to six months into recovery is when basic jogging and light on-field work begin.

Full training ramps back up after that and it’s why recovery timelines can be so different player to player. Athletes put their Achilles tendons through far more stress than the average person, frequently putting enormous strain on them through sharp cuts and jumps. A player won’t be cleared to return to practice until they can go through all of their usual on-field activity with no restrictions. What that looks like for each player will vary, as will how their body is responding and the general healing pace.

Because the Achilles tendon is attached directly to the calf muscles, athletes often lose power and motion in that leg even after a full recovery. NBA star Kevin Durant said his calf muscle is now permanently shorter after tearing his right Achilles. High-level athletes often need more time than the standard “six to nine months” that you hear, especially to return to full strength and their prior performance level.

The good news for Jones is that as a quarterback, he can still be a positive asset even if his leg never returns to full strength. He won’t put his Achilles through the same intense stress that skill position players and especially linemen do. Still, mobility is a big part of Jones’ game, and we saw his performance dip over the last few games when he was hampered by the fractured fibula in his other leg. If he’s not able to move the way he used to, he’s likely a far less efficient quarterback.

Optimistically, Jones could be ready for the start of the 2026 season, but it’s extremely unlikely he’ll be ready to do any team work in training camp. He might not look like the quarterback the Colts have come to expect until 2027.

It’s a devastating blow for a player who was heading toward a hefty mid-tier quarterback contract, but the potential bidding war between Indy and teams like Minnesota and Pittsburgh likely won’t materialize the way it was previously expected to.

The team most comfortable investing in Jones coming off that injury will be the Colts. They’ll have the most information on how his recovery and rehab is going, as well as his prospects for playing next season. If the Colts are hesitant to re-sign him, other teams may take that as an indication Jones may not play next year.

Before his injury, I think Jones was trending towards a contract similar to the ones Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnold are on. Both were seen as quality starters who can win a lot of games but aren’t considered franchise-altering talents you need to lock down at all costs, and that’s a fair assessment of how Jones looked pre-injury. Those contracts sit around three years and $100 million, with about half that guaranteed.

Now, however, Jones could be looking at another one-year deal — if he plays at all. Right now, he’s on a one-year, $14 million contract, and I’d expect Indy to be able to re-sign him to a similar deal. Jones would then enter next season in essentially the same position he was in this year, but with a lot more trust from the Colts should his injury recovery go well.

Do The Colts Have Other Options?

Without a first-round pick until 2028, not many. Not that this is a strong quarterback class — Richardson would be a much better starting option next year than anyone Indianapolis could have drafted in the middle of the first round — but trading away that pick means the Colts have one less option than they would have otherwise.

Free agency is usually pretty bare when it comes to quarterbacks, but Indy did sign Jones in free agency after all. Marcus Mariota, Malik Willis and Kenny Pickett are some pending free agents who could be in play for the Colts if they target someone to come in and compete for the job under the assumption Jones isn’t ready to start the season. None of those names inspire much excitement, though.

The most realistic trade target might be 49ers QB Mac Jones. The former first-round pick of the Patriots has since spent time in Jacksonville and San Francisco with solid success. This season, in particular, he stepped in for an injured Brock Purdy and helped guide the 49ers to a 9-4 record, all while comfortably running HC Kyle Shanahan’s offense.

Quarterback redemption projects are in vogue right now. Everyone looking for the next Mayfield, Darnold, or Daniel Jones will be eyeing Mac Jones, and that may include the Colts. He’s under contract for one more year with the Niners, and they might collect a pretty prize for their backup quarterback.

Alternatively, Indy could swing bigger. Kyler Murray is on the outs in Arizona and has all but officially played his last snap for the Cardinals. The former No. 1 overall pick is dealing with a foot injury and is out for the rest of the season, and it’s basically an open secret that the Cardinals want to move on.

His contract is pretty hefty, but his talent is undeniable. Making a move for Murray — whether the Colts trade for him or wait out the Cardinals to sign him if (when?) he gets cut — would all but end Jones’ chances of re-signing in Indianapolis. But the upside with a move like this is high. It was only a few years ago that Murray was an MVP candidate leading the Cardinals to the playoffs.

Then there’s Richardson. The former No. 4 overall pick in 2023 has battled numerous injuries in his short NFL career, and he’s currently on IR with a broken orbital bone, suffered during pre-game warmups when a resistance belt broke and a piece of the machine hit him in the face. It was a freak accident, but it adds yet another extended injury absence to his ledger.

In the past, Richardson hasn’t been consistent enough down-to-down to run an effective offense. The big plays have always been there, but he’s barely above a 50-percent completion percentage for his career. That just doesn’t fly in the NFL, and it’s why the Colts pursued Jones in free agency to compete with him for the starting job.

Richardson put a lot of work into improving his mechanics this offseason and it seemed to pay off, as reports from Colts training camp indicated the battle between Jones and Richardson was extremely close. At the time, that didn’t mean much, but given how well Jones played, it’s at least possible Richardson took a meaningful leap this offseason. If so, it may change how the Colts approach next year.

Building off that, Richardson had a strong preseason in limited action, going 8/13 for 94 yards in two appearances, adding one rush attempt for nine yards. He was expected to be a strong trade candidate in the spring, but Jones’ injury likely changes that outlook.

It’s possible Richardson still gets traded, especially if Jones’ recovery is ahead of schedule and the Colts bring in a different backup they like. But given Jones won’t participate in training camp, I doubt Indianapolis would be comfortable giving up both their investment and insurance policy in Richardson for a fifth-round pick or equivalent.

What Will The Colts Do?

The Colts essentially have two main paths to choose from next year, and their decision will hinge on how Jones’ recovery is progressing. Nine months from now is the beginning of September, so it’s possible he’s ready to go at the start of next season, or at least close to it.

If Jones is tracking on that timeline, the Colts are probably fine with Richardson starting a couple of games until Jones is ready to go. They would re-sign Jones to a one-year deal and sign a veteran backup like Tyrod Taylor or Gardner Minshew, rolling into training camp with Richardson and the vet as the depth chart while Jones works his way back. If Richardson is lighting it up, they can continue to ride the hot hand and not rush Jones back into the lineup — otherwise, Jones plays as soon as he’s able.

In a sense, that would be pretty straightforward, and it’s the scenario the Colts will be hoping for. This season may turn into a lost season due to the injury, but as long as Jones can play most of next season, Indy can feel good about their plan moving forward.

If Jones won’t be able to play most of next season, that’s where it gets more complicated (and interesting). And Indy’s decision-making process will be determined by their evaluation of Richardson. If they like where Richardson’s development is at, they can bring in some competition (like Mac Jones) to push him and provide insurance while giving their top investment one last chance to prove he can be the long-term starter. Bringing in someone like Jones also ensures that they have a quality starter on the roster, and Jones could even win the job outright out of camp (and might be favored to), much like Daniel Jones was this past summer.

However, my guess is the Colts would pursue Murray. This team has a win-now mentality, as evidenced by their 7-1 start and aggressive move at the trade deadline. Steichen’s offense has a high floor and it’s one of the most efficient units in the league with competent quarterback play. This team, this staff and this organization wants to win now, and Murray would offer them the best chance to do that.

Will Murray run the offense as well as Jones did? That’s an unknown, but there’s one way to find out. The main flaw in Murray’s game is his documented struggles attacking the middle of the field, one of the primary ways Steichen’s offense functions. Still, he’s extremely talented, and Steichen is smart enough to tailor his offense to the quarterback running it.

While this season might already be over for the Colts, they actually do have a few options for next year. There’s a chance they’re right back in the mix in the AFC South in 2026.",https://i0.wp.com/nfltraderumors.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/USATSI_27766315_168383805_lowres-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1706&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-09 19:00:41.011806

Perhaps not so coincidentally, Eagles offensive tackle Lane Johnson was sidelined for his third consecutive contest with a Lisfranc injury in the affair.

Philadelphia's lack of success with Johnson out of the lineup throughout the years has been well documented, so the fact that things have grinded to a halt without him should come as a complete shock.

The Eagles will be facing the Las Vegas Raiders this Sunday, and ESPN's Adam Schefter has revealed a major update on Johnson heading into the matchup.

""Eagles hoping to soon get back their All-Pro OT Lane Johnson from his Lisfranc sprain in his right foot, and they need him. This season, the Eagles are 0-3 without Johnson,"" Schefter wrote.

Schefter added that since Johnson's rookie campaign in 2023, Philadelphia has gone just 15-27 when he is out of the lineup. The former first-round pick is a six-time Pro Bowler and has earned a pair of First-Team All-Pro selections.

That being said, Philly's problems in 2025 run much deeper than Johnson's absence.

It seems pretty clear that there is a significant disconnect between quarterback Jalen Hurts and the rest of the offense this season, and the defense has also been wildly inconsistent.

The Eagles got off to a 4-0 start this year but have gone just 4-5 since, and even during Philadelphia's brief undefeated run to begin the campaign, you could tell that things just weren't quite right.

Yet, on Monday, Bills head coach Sean McDermott spoke to reporters and said there is a chance Bosa does return to the field on Sunday.

“I believe there is,” McDermott said on Monday. “Again, just need to get — you got to understand sight unseen for me. This is the medical team saying we’ll just take it one day at a time.

“So, I’m kind of, you know, waiting on them each day and seeing how it goes. So, we’ll get with him again tomorrow and then as we head into Wednesday. Wednesday, it will probably be a walkthrough. So, that’ll be hard to tell for sure, but at least we’ll be able to get out there and do the walkthrough at least at this point. So, we’ll just take it and see how it goes here.”

If the Bills do get Bosa back, it would be a big boost to Buffalo’s pass rush in a pivotal AFC East showdown.

Bosa has appeared in 12 games, recording 26 tackles, five sacks, and five forced fumbles, as he’s been a solid pass rusher for the Bills.

He noted that pain comes and goes, adding, ""My body has all these things that are a little wonky and a little wrong with it.""

The Bachelor Nation alum shared that he went to the hospital “crawling on all fours” due to overwhelming back pain that was aggravated during an RV trip with a friend.

“Right now, knees to my toes, it’s, like, still tingly, which is crazy,” he said on a March 2025 episode of his Trading Secrets podcast. “And to put in perspective, I don’t know, man, like not to sound douchey, but like two, three weeks ago, maybe a month ago, I was squatting probably like 295 pounds. And right now, I can’t do a squat on my foot. I can’t do a one legged squat, I fall. It’s like I had a stroke or something.”

After these doctors said they thought she had Cushing syndrome and that it may be caused by spiking coritsol levels or steroid injections, the Life & Beth creator thought, ""Wait, I have been getting steroid injections in my scars.""

Hailey Bieber had the ""scariest moment"" of her life when she was having breakfast with husband Justin Bieber and started experiencing stroke-like symptoms in March 2022.

""Justin was like, 'Are you OK?'"" the Rhode skincare mogul shared a month later on YouTube, ""and I just didn't respond because I wasn't sure. And then he asked me again and when I went to respond, I couldn't speak. The right side of my face started drooping. I couldn't get a sentence out.""

While Hailey said the facial drooping stopped and her speech came back, she went to the hospital to make sure she was OK.

""They did some scans and they were able to see that I had suffered a small blood clot to my brain,"" the model added, ""which they labeled and categorized as something called a TIA [Transient Ischemic Attack].""

Later, Hailey went to the University of California, Los Angeles, where she found out she had a hole in her heart called a patent foramen ovale (PFO).

She explained the blood clot had traveled into her heart, ""escaped"" through the hole and went to her brain, leading to the TIA.

Hailey said she had a successful PFO closure procedure and was now feeling great.

The same year Hailey had her health scare, Justin experienced one of his own.

In June 2022, the ""Baby"" singer shared he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, a condition that caused temporary paralysis to parts of his face and forced him to cancel the remainder of his Justice World Tour.

While Jamie Foxx initially kept details of his April 2023 hospitalization private, he later opened up about what he went through.

One day in Atlanta, ""I was having such a bad headache, so I asked my boy, I said, ‘Listen, I need an aspirin,’” the Oscar winner said in his 2024 Netflix special What Had Happened Was... “Before I could get the Aspirin, I went out. I don’t remember 20 days.”

Jamie said he was initially taken to a doctor who gave him a cortisone shot and then sent him home. However, his concerned sister Deidra Dixon then drove him to a hospital, where they got an answer: He had a brain bleed that led to a stroke.

Twenty days after undergoing an operation, the Django Unchained woke up May 4 in a wheelchair and couldn’t walk. He then went to Chicago for rehabilitation and therapy.

""All I can tell you is that I appreciate every prayer,” he said, “because I needed every prayer.”

The reality star revealed that she ""died"" while running a mile during the first challenge of the NBC competition series.

“I don't remember a lot,” she explained on Fit for TV: The Reality of The Biggest Loser. “I remember hearing the helicopter. I just felt like I was floating. And then my grandpa was there. And then I saw darkness. But then I saw light. So I knew, I knew I died that day.”

“My organs were literally shutting down,” she continued. “I didn't realize that I had rhabdomyolysis. And rhabdomyolysis is your body's way of saying, ‘I'm going to shut down on you.’”

Emilia Clarke filmed battle scenes for Game of Thrones, but in 2019, she published an essay in The New Yorker titled ""A Battle for My Life.""

Having a bad headache at the gym, ""I reached the toilet, sank to my knees, and proceeded to be violently, voluminously ill,"" the actress wrote. ""Meanwhile, the pain—shooting, stabbing, constricting pain—was getting worse. At some level, I knew what was happening: my brain was damaged.""

She was taken to the hospital for a brain scan.

""The diagnosis was quick and ominous: a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a life-threatening type of stroke, caused by bleeding into the space surrounding the brain,"" the Emmy nominee added. ""I’d had an aneurysm, an arterial rupture.""

Emilia had immediate surgery to seal the aneurysm, calling the pain ""unbearable."" While she was recovering, she continued, she experienced aphasia and was ""muttering nonsense.""

A week later, ""the aphasia passed,"" Emilia added, and she left the hospital a month after being admitted.

At a 2013 brain scan, she learned a growth ""doubled in size"" and that she needed surgery again.

""When they woke me, I was screaming in pain,"" she wrote. ""The procedure had failed. I had a massive bleed and the doctors made it plain that my chances of surviving were precarious if they didn’t operate again. This time they needed to access my brain in the old-fashioned way—through my skull.""

Thankfully, Emilia shared, she's now ""at a hundred per cent.""

Snoop Dogg's daughter Cori Broadus is grateful for her family.

Because after she suffered a ""severe stroke"" in January 2024, her loved ones rushed to be by her side.

""I texted them that I just had a stroke and sent them a picture,"" she told E! News correspondent Will Marfuggi in December 2024. ""Everybody just came to my rescue.""

Because of other medical concerns, Cori ended up staying in the hospital longer than she initially expected.

""I could have went home after my stroke, but my lupus wasn't doing so well,"" the Snoop's Fatherhood: Cori and Wayne's Story star continued. ""My kidneys were failing. It was a lot going on.""

Today, Cori is on the mend.

""I'm doing great,"" she added. ""I just had a little bit of motor skills that I had to work back on. But other than that, I was fine.""

Shailene Woodley’s early 20s were not an easy time health-wise.

“It got to the point where I was losing my hearing. I couldn’t walk for longer than five minutes at a time without having to lay down for hours, and hours and sleep. Everything I ate hurt my stomach,” the actress said on a September 2024 episode of the SHE MD Podcast. “It was this conflation of issues and diagnoses and different doctors telling me different things.”

So Shailene—who chose to keep the exact condition private—set out to find answers.

“I come from a very holistic background and study herbalism,” she added. “So I was very keen on, ‘I’m going to work with real MDs, [and] I’m also going to work with independent kind of healers.’ Just trying to search for some sense of comfort in my own skin.”

It was a long journey—one that lasted for 10 years.

“Throughout that decade, a lot of other things came from feeling so much discomfort physically,” the Big Little Lies star noted, “which was, ‘My gosh, if everything I eat hurts my stomach, I’m now suddenly afraid of food.’ And then going into the kind of mental f--ckery that can happen with that of body dysmorphia and confusion about identity and feeling safe in my own capsule, in my own skin, what that meant, and what that should be.”

With the division and a playoff spot on the line, the 8-5 Colts are bringing back the quarterback that started for them the last time Indianapolis made the postseason. Enter Phillip Rivers.

The Colts are signing the 44-year-old quarterback to their practice squad, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones reports. Rivers worked out for the team Tuesday, and the team felt comfortable enough to add him to the mix. Rivers became a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame just last month, but a potential induction will have to wait.

Rivers, who is now a grandfather, joins a new-look quarterback room headlined by Riley Leonard and Brett Rypien. Leonard is considered to be the new QB1 with Anthony Richardson still on injured reserve. However, the rookie is dealing with a knee injury, and it's unknown if he will start Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks.

There are four quarterbacks 44 or older to start an NFL game: Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg. Next Sunday, it will have been 1,800 days, or almost five years, since Rivers last took a snap in an NFL game, according to CBS Sports Research.

Oldest starting quarterbacks in NFL history

Rivers last played in 2020 for the Colts. He led Indy to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth, while throwing for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. The former No. 4 overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft spent 16 of his 17 NFL seasons with the San Diego-turned Los Angeles Chargers. An eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback, Rivers went 134-106 as a starter, and currently ranks seventh all-time in passing yards (63,440) and sixth in touchdown passes (421).

How would this impact Rivers' Hall of Fame eligibility?

For the first time, Rivers is eligible for induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He was recently among the 26 modern-era candidates who made the cut as semifinalists. Drew Brees and fellow 2004 draftee Eli Manning are the other modern-era quarterbacks who are currently eligible for enshrinement next summer in Canton, Ohio.

The Hall of Fame requires a player to be retired for five seasons before he is eligible for induction. Under those rules, Rivers is no longer eligible for induction this year. If his plays this season, Rivers' Hall of Fame eligibility would reset, meaning he becomes ineligible for induction until 2031.

Rivers said on the ""Dan Patrick Show"" this offseason that he received interest from teams in 2021 and 2022. The New Orleans Saints even called Rivers and Drew Brees in 2021.

""The reason there was a little bit of a wait is there were a couple of November/Decembers there in 2021 and 2022 where I was staying ready,"" Rivers said. ""I threw on shoulder pads a few times and a helmet and was throwing in the yard and working just in case. And there were a few things that kind of got close. But then the last two years I pretty much knew I was done.""

However, it turns out that Rivers was not 100% done. He is back in the NFL for one last run.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/09/59b0e6db-b3a8-4bb0-a097-b689f0fcda2a/thumbnail/1200x675/833103937cbe9c079b833bdff53aeea8/pr.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 16:01:39.938011

The eight-time Pro Bowl quarterback, who turned 44 on Monday, is being brought in by the Colts for a workout on Tuesday and could be signed, according to multiple reports.

News of the workout comes 24 hours after Colts QB Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles tear during Indianapolis’ 36-19 loss to the Jaguars on Sunday, and after the team revealed rookie QB Riley Leonard is week-to-week with a knee injury of his own.

Rivers hadn’t played since 2020 and had only officially retired from the NFL in July.

NFL Network reported that the workout would help see if he would join the Colts’ practice squad, and ESPN’s Adam Schefter suggested there was still a question of whether Rivers even wants to play again.

“While the Colts need to work out Philip Rivers to see what type of shape he is in, the former quarterback who is now a grandfather also needs to figure out whether he’s willing to play, per source. For now he’s clearly intrigued enough to fly to Indianapolis,” Schefter reported on social media.

He had played one season with the Colts during his 17-year NFL career, spending the other 16 with the Chargers organization.

In his one season with the Colts in 2020, Rivers helped Indy reach the playoffs before getting eliminated in the Wild Card round by the Bills.

He also threw for 4,169 yards and 24 touchdowns in 2020, but that was five years ago and it’s unclear where his skills may still be.

Since then, he has been coaching high school football at St. Michael Catholic in Alabama.

Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles tear during the team's 36-19 Week 14 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. The 28-year-old was visibly upset after suffering the non-contact injury but will now focus on trying to ready himself for the start of the 2026 NFL season.

The Colts will be thin at quarterback with Jones out of action. Anthony Richardson, who started the season as the team's backup signal-caller, remains on IR after suffering a fractured orbital bone ahead of the team's Week 6 game against the Arizona Cardinals.

That leaves sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard as the team's starting quarterback and journeyman Brett Rypien as the lone other healthy quarterback in Indianapolis' organization.

That said, the Colts are highly likely to add another quarterback to the fold to provide depth behind Leonard and Rypien. The pickings on the free-agent market are slim, but Indianapolis – which, at 8-5, is still within striking distance of an AFC wild-card berth despite a three-game losing streak – could potentially get creative as it tries to keep its postseason chances alive.

Here's a look at some external quarterback options for the Colts to consider as they deal with a catastrophic quarterback injury.

Sam Ehlinger

Realistically, the Colts will probably have to sign a quarterback like Ehlinger to provide depth to their quarterback room rather than chase a dream option.

Ehlinger, 27, is currently on the Denver Broncos practice squad but spent the first four seasons of his career with the Colts. He was the team's third-string quarterback last season and would have familiarity with Steichen's scheme, making him an ideal backup choice for Indianapolis.

Ehlinger has made just three career starts, all of which came in 2022. He posted an 0-3 career record across those games and has completed 63.4% of his passes for 573 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions while adding 96 yards on 20 carries.

Taylor Heinicke

If the Colts want more starting experience than Ehlinger provides, Heinicke represents one of the best free-agent quarterbacks available. The 32-year-old has a 13-15-1 record across 29 career starts and has completed 62.5% of his career passes for 6,663 yards, 39 touchdowns and 28 interceptions.

Most importantly, Heinicke has experience comporting himself well as an emergency replacement at quarterback. In 2020, he famously was called upon to start a playoff game for Washington. He completed 59.1% of his passes for 306 yards, one touchdown and one interception while adding 46 yards and a score on the ground and gave the Commanders a fighting chance in a loss against the eventual Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Heinicke could be asked to play a similar role for Indianapolis.

Trevor Siemian

Like Heinicke, Siemian has a solid amount of starting experience. The 33-year-old has made 33 regular-season starts during his career while posting respectable numbers, including a 58.5% completion rate, 7,751 passing yards, 44 touchdowns and 32 interceptions.

Siemian is currently on the Titans practice squad, so the Colts would need to sign the Northwestern product to their 53-man roster to take him away from their divisional rival.

Ryan Tannehill

Tannehill might be an option in name only for the Colts. The 37-year-old admitted in a late-November interview with The Escapist he believes he is likely done playing in the NFL.

""I think that chapter is closed,"" Tannehill said of his future. ""I think last year, that was where I was at, if the right opportunity came up and was right for our family. Staying in shape and staying ready. I had plenty of calls, but nothing ever felt like the right opportunity that I was looking for. That was last NFL season. At this point, I think that ship has sailed for me.""

Tannehill may remain steadfast in his belief. However, if the Colts can convince him to give the NFL one last shot, he could be the type of stabilizing force that gives Indianapolis a chance to stay afloat and work its way into a wild-card berth.

Tannehill has a career record of 81-70 in 151 starts and has completed 64.3% of his passes for 34,881 yards, 216 touchdowns and 115 interceptions. His experience would provide a boost to Indianapolis' otherwise green quarterback room and he would be a good fit for Shane Steichen's offense.

So, at the very least, the Colts should give Tannehill a call and see if he's willing to end his pseudo-retirement.

Hendon Hooker

If the Colts are merely looking for upside at quarterback now, they could take a look at Hooker. The Tennessee product was released from the Carolina Panthers' practice squad in early November and still hasn't landed with another NFL team.

Hooker was a third-round pick by the Lions in the 2023 NFL Draft after he completed 69.6% of his passes for 3,135 yards, 27 touchdowns and two interceptions while rushing for 430 yards and five touchdowns during his senior season. The 27-year-old has yet to carve out success at the NFL level, but perhaps Steichen will see some upside in a quarterback who has previously been lauded for his accuracy and mobility.

Hooker has attempted just nine career NFL passes, completing six of them for 62 yards.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/08/USAT/87670419007-ryan-tannehill-titans-120825.jpg?crop=5728,3225,x0,y22&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-09 13:02:02.148111

Here’s what stood out from Week 14 across the NFL: End of an era in Kansas City?
The drive that could’ve saved the Chiefs’ season ended with an interception because Kelce couldn’t hold onto the ball.","In all likelihood, this season’s AFC playoff field is going to look nothing like it has in years. No Kansas City Chiefs. No Cincinnati Bengals. And quite possibly, no Baltimore Ravens.

The Chiefs’ run of nine straight AFC West titles? Finished. Their streak of seven straight conference championship games? All but over. That’s Kansas City’s new reality following Sunday night’s 20-10 loss to the Houston Texans. The Chiefs, winners of three straight AFC titles, will almost assuredly be watching the postseason from home for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era. Meanwhile, driven by the league’s nastiest defense, the Texans (8-5) are winners of five straight and currently in the AFC playoff field for the first time all year.

The Chiefs are not alone among expected AFC contenders. The Bengals are finished after allowing a 10-point second-half lead to slip away in the Buffalo snow. The game turned on back-to-back Joe Burrow interceptions in the fourth quarter, and Josh Allen accounted for two of his four touchdowns in the final 7:41 to push the Bills to a 39-34 comeback win. Buffalo is now 9-4, Cincinnati 4-9.

And after clawing their way back to the front of the AFC North race, the Ravens have dropped two straight division games and fallen out of the current playoff seedings.

The door has opened, it seems, and the conference’s new blood — the New England Patriots, Denver Broncos and Jacksonville Jaguars — look primed to make January interesting.

One team that appeared ready to join that group throughout the first half of the season might have seen its playoff window close in the cruelest of ways Sunday. In Jacksonville, the Indianapolis Colts lost more than a divisional showdown. They also lost their starting quarterback, Daniel Jones, to what they fear is a torn Achilles. The 36-19 defeat was Indy’s fourth in five games, and the Colts are now in third place in the AFC South with a brutal schedule the rest of the way and sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard as their quarterback.

The Jaguars, meanwhile, have won four straight and are sitting alone atop the AFC South at 9-4. With so much of the Coach of the Year chatter focused on Mike Vrabel and Ben Johnson — deservedly so — the job Liam Coen has done in Jacksonville has been easy to overlook. It’s time to pay attention. He’s remade that franchise in a matter of months.

While Vrabel’s 11-2 Patriots were on a bye, the Broncos slid past them as the AFC’s top seed. Denver has won 10 straight after beating the Las Vegas Raiders 24-17 and owns a common opponent tiebreaker over New England.

In the NFC, the Los Angeles Rams moved back into the top spot after routing the Arizona Cardinals 45-17, while the No. 1 seed entering Sunday, the Chicago Bears, fell all the way to the No. 7 seed after a 28-21 loss to the Green Bay Packers. It was the Bears’ first loss since Halloween. The Packers, meanwhile, have rebounded nicely from that two-game skid in early November. Matt LaFleur’s team has won four straight and is back in front in the NFC North.

Both the Rams and Seahawks are 10-3, but L.A. owns the tiebreaker by virtue of a head-to-head meeting in Week 11. Seattle has been lights-out ever since. Over the past two games, the Seahawks’ defense has forced eight turnovers and allowed a combined nine points. This unit is downright scary and dominated again in an easy 37-9 win over the reeling Atlanta Falcons.

That 2-point loss to the Rams in Week 11 — the game in which Sam Darnold tossed four interceptions, almost half his season total — is the only defeat for Seattle dating to Oct. 5. Mike Macdonald, now the first coach in franchise history to win 10 or more games each of his first two seasons, has his team playing like a Super Bowl contender.

In rainy Tampa, the NFC South race tightened up. The New Orleans Saints stunned the Buccaneers 24-20, a result that had to have the Carolina Panthers smiling during their bye week. The Bucs and Panthers are both 7-6 with four games left and will meet in Weeks 16 and 18, likely with the division title on the line.

A week ago, Steelers fans were chanting “Fire Tomlin” during Pittsburgh’s listless loss to the Bills. On Sunday, Mike Tomlin’s team — and his 42-year-old quarterback — responded with their best offensive game of the year: Aaron Rodgers’ 284 passing yards were a season best, and the Steelers handed the Ravens a 27-22 loss. After all the noise in Pittsburgh all week, plenty of it centered on Tomlin’s status as his team again stumbled late in the season, what did Sunday’s result mean?

“It means maybe you guys will shut the hell up for a week,” Rodgers told reporters. The victory moves the Steelers to 7-6 and back atop the division with four to play. They’ll see the Ravens (6-7) again in Week 18.

In Cleveland, the Tennessee Titans won for just the second time all season, beating the Browns 31-29. Shedeur Sanders threw for three touchdowns and ran for another in the loss but wasn’t on the field for the Browns’ 2-point attempt that could have tied it late. More significant was the impact of Tennessee’s second win on the top of the draft board. Thanks to a strength-of-schedule tiebreaker, it’s now the New York Giants who own the No. 1 pick. If that holds, it would be the franchise’s first No. 1 selection since 1965.

In Minnesota, J.J. McCarthy put together the best game of his young career in a 31-0 blanking of the Washington Commanders. McCarthy threw for three touchdowns in the Vikings’ first win in over a month. The Commanders, meanwhile, got quarterback Jayden Daniels back, but he was a rusty 9-for-20 for 78 yards and an interception before leaving with an elbow injury (coach Dan Quinn said Daniels could have returned). A year after a stirring run to the NFC Championship Game, the Commanders are 3-10. Minnesota is 5-8.

In East Rutherford, N.J., the Miami Dolphins won their fourth straight by running all over the Jets, 34-10. “It’s BS,” Jets coach Aaron Glenn said of Miami’s 239 rushing yards. “Way too many.” While the Dolphins have rallied admirably under embattled coach Mike McDaniel in the second half of the season, winning five of their last six after a 1-6 start, Glenn’s Jets have clinched another January at home. The franchise’s 15-year playoff drought is the longest in North American major sports.

Here’s what stood out from Week 14 across the NFL:

End of an era in Kansas City?

Travis Kelce, the 36-year-old future Hall of Famer, stumbled off the field in a daze, saying nothing. Two plays. Two drops. The drive that could’ve saved the Chiefs’ season ended with an interception because Kelce couldn’t hold onto the ball.

That’s how it ended Sunday night at Arrowhead. This was a slugfest, an ugly defensive battle, a 10-0 Texans lead at halftime that was knotted up by the start of the fourth quarter. Then came a pair of pivotal calls from Andy Reid, who elected to go for it on fourth down on his half of the field twice in the final period. Both times, his offense failed to convert.

Then — trailing by seven with 3:44 left and his team’s playoff hopes possibly hanging in the balance — Mahomes had one final shot. The drive lasted two plays. Kelce dropped one, then another, the second of which turned into an interception for Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair. Houston tacked on a field goal to put the game out of reach.

Will the final days of Kelce’s career unfold over the coming month? He weighed retirement after last season, and as disappointing as this one has been, it’s not all that difficult to imagine him walking away.

Either way, the Chiefs will have to regroup for 2026 and find more answers on offense, with or without one of their longtime stalwarts. It wasn’t just Kelce on Sunday. The Chiefs dropped six Mahomes passes, the most in any game he’s ever played. On third and fourth downs, Kansas City finished 3-for-10.

The Chiefs built their dynasty by executing in key moments. All season long, they’ve found ways to screw them up.

The Texans, meanwhile, have only allowed two opponents this season to score more than 20 points, and none since early November. With the game on the line Sunday night — in the same stadium Houston’s season ended last January in the divisional round — DeMeco Ryans’ unit shut the door, over and over and over. Some of it was KC’s mistakes. Plenty more was the Texans’ pressure on Mahomes and sticky coverage in the back end. That’s what a championship defense looks like.

If Houston keeps this up, it could be a problem in the AFC playoffs. No one will want to see that defense.

LaFleur, Packers take Round 1

It was an odd jab, but one to file away. The day he was introduced as the Bears’ new coach in January, Ben Johnson lauded praise on his former boss in Detroit, Dan Campbell, as well as Minnesota’s Kevin O’Connell. Then he threw this in about the NFC North’s other head man: “I kind of enjoyed beating Matt LaFleur twice a year.”

Johnson was referring to his time with the Lions. His first test with his new team arrived Sunday. And by the end of this one, the Packers’ faithful at Lambeau Field were chanting a familiar refrain: “The Bears still suck.” The tally? LaFleur 1, Johnson 0. The handshake between the two head coaches was noticeably icy.

“We’ll see them again in two weeks,” LaFleur said later, downplaying any personal satisfaction after beating Johnson. “It’s Packers-Bears.”

The engine behind this one was a Packers offense that has come to life in recent weeks. Jordan Love threw three touchdowns, including two to Christian Watson, and running back Josh Jacobs scored the go-ahead TD in the fourth quarter.

Caleb Williams had a shot to tie it late, but he underthrew a fourth-and-1 pass from the Packers’ 14-yard line that was intercepted by Keisean Nixon. Since that ugly 7-point outing against the Eagles a month ago — which now feels like the low point of the Packers’ season — Green Bay has responded with games of 27, 23, 31 and 28 points. This offense is finding itself just in time for a playoff run.

The win moves the Packers to the top of the NFC North, a division they haven’t won since 2021. After stumbling to a 1-5 mark in division games last season, the Packers have started 4-0 this year. Meanwhile, the Bears’ five-game win streak is history, and they are now 1-12 in their last 13 against the Packers.

Are the Colts finished?

This was a worst-case scenario unfolding in real time, a playoff contender watching its postseason chances fade to black in one brutal sequence. There was no hit from the Jaguars’ defense, just Daniel Jones crumbling to the grass in Jacksonville after a first-half completion, grabbing his lower right leg in agony. A moment later, while the Colts’ training staff surrounded him, the quarterback unstrapped his helmet and twice slammed it on the field. It was about as much emotion as Jones has shown all season.

The 36-19 defeat, the Colts’ 12th straight road loss to the Jaguars, feels less consequential than what Jones’ injury will mean for the franchise moving forward. Simply put: This muddies everything. It has been a stunning turn of events for a team that had the best record in the league just five weeks ago.

Back in late October, Indianapolis was 7-1 and steamrolling opponents every week. Jonathan Taylor was running over and around every defense he saw. Jones was scripting a stunning second act. First-year coordinator Lou Anarumo was revitalizing the defense and Shane Steichen had worked his way into the Coach of the Year conversation. General manager Chris Ballard, emboldened by his team’s hot start, made an ambitious move at the trade deadline, sending two first-round picks to New York in exchange for cornerback Sauce Gardner.

The Colts were going for it. Now they are 8-5.

They’ve dropped four of their last five. And indications are that Jones tore the Achilles in his right leg, an injury that will jeopardize his availability for the start of the 2026 season. The QB was already playing through a left fibula injury, which played a significant role in the offense’s regression over the last few weeks. Now, a nightmare injury comes at one of the worst times. With a brutal stretch coming up — at Seattle, home against San Francisco and Jacksonville, at Houston — Indianapolis is staring at some long odds to make its first playoff trip since 2020.

Furthermore, Jones’ future in Indianapolis now becomes a different conversation. The trade for Gardner was a clear indication this team felt comfortable moving forward with Jones beyond this season; you don’t send away two first-round picks if you don’t believe you have your quarterback of the future already on the roster. Jones will be a free agent in the spring, and the Colts preferred locking him up before he hit the open market. How much does the injury change that? And how much pause does it give an organization that has cycled through six Week 1 starters dating to 2019?

Complicating matters is the uncertain status of Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 pick in 2023, who lost the starting job to Jones in August and has been on injured reserve for over a month after suffering an orbital fracture during a freak stretching incident in the locker room in October. Steichen has said recently that the team remains “hopeful” that Richardson can return this season, but he’s still regaining vision in his eye. It doesn’t sound like he’ll be ready anytime soon.

Richardson will be entering his fourth NFL season next year, and the Colts have publicly vowed not to trade him. If Richardson is able to return this season, it’ll be another opportunity for the young quarterback to overcome the rocky start to his career. And maybe his last opportunity in Indianapolis.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/08002751/GettyImages-2250563329-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-09 12:04:57.832167

Eleven months ago, he crumbled around the 50-yard line without contact early in the second quarter of the regular-season finale, clutching his right knee in agony on the Lambeau Field grass as he covered his face with his left hand.

On Sunday, Watson’s reactions were quite the opposite against the Bears. He was Griddy-ing, Lambeau Leap-ing and high-fiving fans and teammates alike with a mile-wide smile. From torn ACL to explosive piece on a Super Bowl contender, Watson continues proving why, even after such a significant injury, this may be the best version of him we’ve seen.

In the Packers’ 28-21 win that catapulted them atop the NFC North at 9-3-1, Watson caught four passes for 89 yards and two touchdowns. He’s found the end zone five times in the last four games. The Packers may not have a true No. 1 receiver, but Watson looks like the closest thing to it down the home stretch.

“It means a lot to me, for sure,” Watson said postgame. “Honestly, I tried not to think about it that much, but as the game was kind of getting going, it was definitely creeping in my mind a little bit. I’m just so thankful and blessed to be able to do what I do, and I’m glad that today panned out how it did.”

Watson first played in a game this season exactly nine months and three weeks after tearing his ACL on Jan. 5. He’s a physical marvel, not only for that, but also in how he makes defenses look foolish on the field. His Moss-ing of New York Giants cornerback Korie Black for the game-winning touchdown in Week 11, his 51-yard haul over Detroit Lions cornerback Amik Robertson into the end zone on Thanksgiving and his 41-yard slant-and-score while breezing past Bears safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson on Sunday are just some recent examples.

On the last play, quarterback Jordan Love called an audible at the line of scrimmage after identifying that the Bears were in man coverage. Watson cooked Gardner-Johnson on a slant from in between the hashes and numbers on the right side of the offensive formation. He caught the ball at the 34-yard line with a step or two on Gardner-Johnson and the Bears in a single-high-safety defense. The rest was history.

According to Next Gen Stats, Watson clocked at 21.6 miles per hour as he glided into the end zone to give the Packers a two-score lead midway through the third quarter. That was the 15th-fastest maximum speed of any player this season and sixth-fastest of any wide receiver, according to NGS. Head coach Matt LaFleur said he’d love to run more of those plays for Watson, but it’s hard when teams are playing cloud or quarters coverages. Watson burning his man was the second time Sunday he devoured one-on-one coverage with speed for a touchdown, the first coming against potential All-Pro safety Kevin Byard for a 23-yard score in the second quarter as the Bears sent seven at Love and Watson ran a post route from in between the hashes and numbers on the left side.

“That man’s different,” wide receiver/cornerback Bo Melton said. “Everybody know that in this locker room. He’s the gazelle, man. That man 6-4 and runs a 4.1. It’s hard to cover the man. Just to see him out there and just to see him happy and playing and him being healthy and all that, I thank God for that because he works so hard. That’s a hard worker, and at the end of the day, he’s blessed with the abilities, but he works hard for it. I love to see when he shines. Love to see when anyone shines in this locker room, but love to see Christian, for sure.”

Since returning against the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 8, Watson has 452 receiving yards, which rank tied for 11th in the NFL over those seven weeks. His 18.1 yards per catch during that stretch rank fourth. His five touchdown catches rank tied for fourth. His expected points added per target rank fourth, according to TruMedia.

In other words, a guy fresh off ACL rehab has been one of the NFL’s best wide receivers over the past two months.

“We’ve all watched him during rehab and things like that throughout the offseason and training camp to be able to get back,” Love said. “I think he’s just playing at a really high level right now. We talked in the locker room after. This game meant a lot to him for that reason. For him to be able to come out healthy and obviously have two big-time touchdown catches and make some other big-time plays, I think since he’s been back, he’s just been making play after play and been playing at a really high level.”

An even higher level than before he tore his ACL?

“Definitely,” Love said. “I definitely think so.”

Before Watson even returned to practice in early October, the Packers inked him to a one-year extension the month prior. According to Over The Cap, the deal was worth $11 million with a shade over $6 million guaranteed. For Watson, it provided financial stability and peace of mind coming off a major injury in a contract year. For the Packers, it provided a cushion for their pockets in 2026 if Watson exploded — like he’s doing.

Now Watson won’t hit the open market, where he’d surely command a higher price tag for the 2026 season than he’s currently making. Even so, the Packers might have to revisit the negotiating table soon to secure Watson long term. If the past two months are any indication of what’s to come post-injury, the Packers need him in Green Bay for both now and the foreseeable future.

“He’s a dynamic player, and we’ve got to continue to find ways to get him the ball,” LaFleur said. “What happened a year ago versus the Chicago Bears and how he’s responded and how he’s worked to get himself into a spot now where you go out and you see what he can do, I’ve got a lot of love and a lot of respect for Christian Watson.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/08182011/GettyImages-2250607403-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-09 12:05:00.912742

Coming off a pretty humbling loss, even by 2-11 team standards, the Giants had an interesting bye week.","Let's face it: Not everyone loves the holiday season.

Consider the 2025 Chiefs, who saw their realistic playoff dreams fade away on a cold night at Arrowhead, the place that used to fuel other teams' nightmares.

What about the Colts? They watched their starting quarterback go down for the season in a loss to their division rivals, putting them at serious risk of becoming just the third team since 1990 to start a campaign at 7-1 and miss the playoffs.

Then there are the reigning Super Bowl champion Eagles, who dropped their third straight -- with the offense committing major sins in each -- in a Monday OT heartbreaker, casting more doubt on their chances to repeat.

Of course, the holiday spirit was strong for our top three teams from last week (who remain as such this week), with all winning convincingly and building momentum for the postseason. The Packers and Bills aren't too far behind them, and they celebrated rousing victories on Sunday. And no team did more to diminish the winter blues than the Steelers, who suddenly find themselves back in the AFC North driver's seat after crashing one week prior.

Make no mistake: This playoff field is going to be utterly fascinating -- and likely quite different from what we've seen in recent years.

A week after their first loss since early October, the Rams racked up season highs in points (45) and yards from scrimmage (530) in a road beatdown of the Cardinals. Arizona played tough early but collapsed under the onslaught of Los Angeles' persistent and balanced attack. Right now, the Kyren Williams-Blake Corum backfield combo looks like a real winner. The Rams nearly ran for as many yards (249) as they threw for (281) on Sunday, and their only negative plays on offense came on a few annoying penalties. Other than that, they were dominant, rewarding my faith in them -- keeping them in the No. 1 spot -- after the Week 13 defeat at Carolina. Tough games lie ahead against the Lions and Seahawks, the latter of which likely will decide the NFC West and could seal the top seed for the Rams.

The Seahawks were surprisingly sluggish in the first half, but they cranked it up after the break, with Rashid Shaheed giving them a huge nudge via his 100-yard kickoff return. What makes these 'Hawks dangerous is that they have firepower in all three phases of the game. The special teams feature big legs and TD potential in the return games. Sam Darnold and the offense certainly can turn up the heat, as they did in the second half at Atlanta. But the defense might be the most incendiary unit on the team, holding the Falcons to three field goals and forcing three turnovers. Granted, Seattle hasn't faced the most fearsome group of quarterbacks (and will avoid Daniel Jones in this Sunday's game against Indianapolis), but Mike Macdonald's defense is close to full health and firing on all cylinders.

By sweeping the Raiders, the Broncos secured a key tiebreaker with the Patriots, earning a common-opponents edge between the two teams if they finish with the same record. That gives them pole position for the AFC's No. 1 seed, even if this thing could -- and probably will -- go down to the wire. Bo Nix led a very efficient offensive attack, with Denver scoring its first opening-drive touchdown since Week 2 and not letting up. There wasn't anything mind-blowing about Sunday's performance, but it was what was expected from a strong Denver team against a weak Las Vegas club, with the Raiders' late TD and field goal making this contest look a lot closer than it actually was. The Broncos' final four games are a real test, and don't expect any mercy when they visit Kansas City in a few weeks, even if the Chiefs are officially eliminated from postseason play by then.

Ten straight wins, followed by a bye and a shot to end the Bills' division run this Sunday in Foxborough. The Patriots are flying high in what could be a post-Chiefs playoff field, with a chance to earn a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the postseason. Beating Buffalo won't be easy, especially with Josh Allen heating up and undoubtedly champing at the bit for a second crack at that Patriots defense, which will be without Milton Williams. New England also will be shorthanded on the offensive line for a bit, and the run game has had its limitations. But Drake Maye and his receivers, with some brilliant guidance from Josh McDaniels, have made it work quite well to this point. The Pats aren't a perfect team, but they're pretty darned compelling, and they'll give anyone they face from here on out a great battle. That's guaranteed.

Jordan Love has stepped up in a major way over the past couple games, with four touchdown passes against Detroit and three more vs. Chicago, rallying on Sunday after a bad early interception. The big-play threat is back in the Packers' offense, even if it was surprising how much man coverage the Bears threw their way. Still, Christian Watson had two long touchdowns, Bo Melton added one of his own, and Jayden Reed reprised his old role (with three big first-down conversions) in his long-awaited return from injury. It also helps when Josh Jacobs is grinding out late yards, fueling the game-winning drive with some big plays. The defense looked gassed by game's end, but a third-down stuff and fourth-down pick were just what Green Bay needed. This is a tough team with Super Bowl potential, even if the Pack nearly coughed up a double-digit lead to the Bears.

Down 10 points late, with the snow really piling up, Josh Allen and an opportunistic Bills defense dominated the final eight minutes with an incredible flourish against the scrappy Bengals, keeping Buffalo's faint divisional hopes alive. The Bills will need to beat the well-rested Patriots on Sunday in Foxborough -- and do more than that -- to even harbor those thoughts, but it's possible. Yet, I think this team remains dangerous as a wild card, if that's the way it goes. With the Bengals, Ravens and Chiefs all falling off, and even the upstart Colts falling on hard times, you simply cannot count out an Allen-led group in the playoffs. I'm not ignoring Buffalo's defensive limitations, nor am I looking away from James Cook's rising fumble total. But with Allen, the Bills nearly always have a chance.

This was a humbling loss, not a demoralizing one, even if the Packers have seized temporary control of the division. The Lions aren't going away, either, and to demonstrate just how tenuous everything is at this time of year, the Bears fell from the top seed in the NFC last week to the last team in the playoff field. All for a team that was a few plays away from potentially stealing the game up in Green Bay. The rematch in two weekends remains huge and could shift the division back in the Bears' direction, but their hopes of a first-round bye might be gone now, and the wind's at Green Bay's back. Caleb Williams had his moments but couldn't finish, and the defense just gave up too many big plays, with not enough pressure and crossed wires in the secondary.

The league's most beat-up team rode into the Week 14 bye on a high, winning three straight, and you could make a strong case that having their week off earlier in the season might have helped more from a health standpoint. They're not going to get back any significant players from injury, and Kyle Juszczyk's status remains up in the air. That said, it's probably a great thing that San Francisco's stars -- especially workhorse Christian McCaffrey -- had a break. Winning out could actually give the Niners a shot at the No. 1 seed, and three of the final four are at home, with the lone road game (at Indianapolis) looking different following Daniel Jones' injury. Don't count San Francisco out, even with all the injuries.

If you were to ask me to identify Jacksonville's superpower, I'd probably stumble my way through an answer before mentioning the run defense. But once Daniel Jones was knocked out of Sunday's game, the Jaguars flexed their muscles and put the Colts away to wrest temporary control of the division. The Texans are coming, but these Jaguars are making things work in Liam Coen's first season. He might be running third in the Coach of the Year race behind Mike Vrabel and Ben Johnson, but Coen's offense looked nice early against Indy before slowing down after halftime. All in all, though, this team is playing good football at the right time. Jacksonville has allowed just 13 points per game over the past four, and it's looking like the Jags could face undrafted rookie Brady Cook at QB when the Jets come to town this Sunday.

With their backs against the wall, the Lions willed their way to victory over the Cowboys and kept alive their streak of 15 straight wins following a loss. That's the kind of mental toughness Dan Campbell has instilled in his team, but that resilience is going to be put to the test with Brian Branch suffering a season-ending Achilles injury. The star safety is as much the heartbeat of Detroit's defense as Aidan Hutchinson is -- losing Branch at an already-thin position could be a massive blow to Kelvin Sheppard's unit. Adding to the degree of difficulty: three road games in the final four, with zero gimmes remaining. The Lions' only contest against a team that's not currently in the playoff field comes in a short week at Minnesota on Christmas Day. With Jahmyr Gibbs on their side, anything is possible. But no doubt, the Lions still have a ton of work to do and several obstacles in their way.

C.J. Stroud completed three passes in the second half -- three! -- but the Texans produced just enough offense to finish what the defense started. DeMeco Ryans' elite D has thrown some beauties this season, but Sunday night's effort was probably its most important performance of the season, with Houston intercepting Patrick Mahomes three times (even if the last one was a gift off the hands of Travis Kelce). Andy Reid rolled the dice twice on fourth downs, and in some ways, that was a nod to just how good the Texans are defensively. Reid felt he had to play that riskily in order to get any spark offensively. Houston also managed an injury to Nick Chubb, with Dare Ogunbowale spelling Woody Marks to score his first rushing TD since 2022 (on only his fourth carry of the season). The Texans keep finding ways to win games, and they could run their streak to seven straight, with the Cardinals and Raiders on tap in Houston.

Justin Herbert was sacked seven times and hit a whole lot more, struggling to find open receivers and protect the broken left hand he had surgery on a week before Monday’s game. But it was Herbert’s running that gave the offense the tiny boost it needed, and though the Chargers failed to score a touchdown after their opening drive, they held on for dear life for a dramatic overtime win. The defense rose up time and time again, picking off Jalen Hurts four times, including the game-sealer just outside the end zone in overtime. Cameron Dicker remains the league's most underrated kicker, making five field goals, with three coming in the final eight minutes of regulation and overtime. Just a gutsy, ugly, chaotic victory for Jim Harbaugh’s team, with style points absolutely unnecessary. The Bolts keep scraping by.

Jalen Hurts overcame a nightmarish first half to rally the Eagles and put them in position to beat the Chargers in overtime ... but then threw his fourth interception of the game on a pass forced into coverage. Hurts’ third INT clanged off A.J. Brown’s hands, but the other three -- plus his fumble after his own pick -- were on the quarterback. In the first half, the Eagles had a touchdown erased by a holding penalty, missed a field goal and generally looked listless offensively outside of Saquon Barkley. It was Barkley’s terrific, fourth-quarter TD run that put Philadelphia ahead for the first time, but the Eagles couldn’t contain Justin Herbert as a runner. Still, it’s hard to blame a defense that held the Chargers to 3.9 yards per play and didn't allow a touchdown after Los Angeles' opening drive. The Eagles consistently got good starting field position from the return teams but had eight empty drives and went 0-for-2 in the red zone. After a third straight loss, this will be another long week in Philly. If the Eagles can't get right in Sunday's home game against the lowly Raiders, the reigning champs are in serious trouble.

What a difference a week made. Mike Tomlin's future in Pittsburgh was in question, it felt like it could be it for Aaron Rodgers and the Steelers were cooked ... until they went out and beat the Ravens in Baltimore. Rodgers came out like a man on a mission. He didn’t complete a pass of 20-plus air yards in the entire month of November, but he hit on three of them against the Ravens. Granted, the offense ran out of steam in the fourth quarter, and the defense started cracking, allowing Baltimore to score on four straight drives. But the Steelers were terrific in the red zone, holding the Ravens to two field goals and turning them over on downs in that area of the field, with Alex Highsmith ’s sack deep in Pittsburgh territory ending it. The Steelers now have stolen the momentum back in the AFC North. Can they hang on to give Tomlin an eighth division title (and first since 2020)?

No way to sugarcoat it: Sunday went about as poorly as the Colts possibly could have imagined. Daniel Jones suffered a season-ending Achilles injury, Indianapolis lost in Jacksonville (again), and now the Colts are a game back in the division race. We've elevated the concern level to DEFCON 1, with Indy falling to a 32 percent chance to make the playoffs. Even if the Colts can get back DeForest Buckner and Sauce Gardner on defense, the offense is adrift without Jones, and now backup QB Riley Leonard is dealing with a leg injury of his own. Jones' Achilles tear could significantly impact the team's future plans for him, with the quarterback now set to hit free agency while rehabbing a major health setback. Just an awful turn of events that has thrown the franchise into a state of desperation. At the beginning of November, Indianapolis owned the best record in the NFL at 7-1. On Tuesday, the Colts signed 44-year-old Philip Rivers, who hasn't taken an NFL snap since January of 2021.

The Ravens’ playoff chances aren’t dead, but they absolutely coughed up a great chance by losing two straight at home to division rivals. After Baltimore was blown out by Cincinnati, it felt that the Ravens understood the assignment against a battered Steelers team, yet they fell behind by two touchdowns early and ultimately couldn’t make up enough ground. John Harbaugh's team probably needs to win out (vs. the Bengals, Patriots, Packers and Steelers) in order to get in, and that just doesn’t look likely after another disjointed, uneven performance. Watching Jaylen Warren go untouched for a long catch-and-run TD was a painful sight after all the progress the Ravens had made defensively, and Lamar Jackson -- as it’s been much of the season -- just couldn’t find a consistent rhythm.

Less than three minutes into Sunday’s game in Tampa, the Buccaneers found themselves in a hole they’d spend much of the game trying to dig themselves out of. They turned the ball over on downs a whopping five times, with Tampa Bay scoring only three points after the Saints gave the ball up in three possessions via a missed kick, an interception and their own fourth-down failure. Twice, the Bucs took the lead, only to see the Saints take it back both times. There would be no third-time charm. The Bucs remain the statistical favorites to win the NFC South, but they’ve made it harder on themselves and given the dangerous Panthers even more hope and opportunity to steal the division. Tampa Bay just hasn't looked right for a month or more.

The league's most curiously competitive team (along with the Jaguars), the Panthers floated into their Week 14 bye following the dramatic home victory over the Rams that gave them a real path to the postseason. Tampa Bay's crushing loss to New Orleans just made it a little smoother, too. Of course, the way this Carolina season has gone -- ping-ponging between wins and losses since Week 7, and having some interesting results along the way -- we're not taking anything for granted. The Saints are no gimme this Sunday; they beat the Panthers, 17-7, a month ago. But the division should be decided in Carolina's showdowns with Tampa Bay in Weeks 16 and 18. Can Bryce Young deliver? He, like the team, has been alternately hot and cold, but Young has a chance to fully secure his future in Carolina with a big finish.

The Cowboys' playoff chances are on life support after the loss at Detroit, a game in which the defense reverted to old form and the offensive line couldn't protect Dak Prescott consistently enough. CeeDee Lamb also was knocked out with a concussion, and George Pickens couldn't pick up the slack -- even if Ryan Flournoy did, in an eye-opening performance for the second-year pro. It will be interesting to see how much Flournoy is featured down the stretch and whether Pickens plays well enough to convince the Cowboys to make him a strong contract offer in the offseason. The 'Boys will still have plenty to play for down the stretch, even with the postseason dreams essentially cooked.

Kansas City isn't mathematically eliminated from the playoffs -- yet -- but Sunday felt like a funeral at Arrowhead, with the 20-10 loss to Houston officially ending the Chiefs' streak of division titles at nine. Patrick Mahomes didn't have anything close to a vintage game against a terrific Texans defense, but he also didn't drop two catchable passes with a chance to tie or win the game in the fourth quarter. First came Rashee Rice's brutal flub on fourth down, giving the ball back to the Texans. Then, after a great defensive stand, Travis Kelce's bobble ended up as a game-killing Texans interception. There couldn't have been a more cruel, painful knife twist than that ending -- a surefire sign that this offense is broken, even if we've known it for a while. We've done various pre-eulogies, maybe even retracting a few along the way, but this feels like it. A shocking end to an incredible run.

The Dolphins have won four straight games, and they’ve all come with Tua Tagovailoa failing to reach the 200-yard passing mark. They’ve undergone an identity shift in those four games, holding all four opponents to 17 points or fewer and leaning heavily on the run game. We’ll see if that can continue after De'Von Achane left the game with a rib injury (apparently, it's not too severe), although Jaylen Wright had a career game and Ollie Gordon II also chipped in with his own score. With its own playoff hopes dwindling, Miami continues its quest to play the role of spoiler down the stretch (three of its four remaining opponents harbor playoff hopes). But Mike McDaniel deserves credit for getting these Fins back on track. The fourth-year head coach appears to have cooled his seat considerably, even as the postseason remains the longest of long shots.

Granted, it happened against a Washington defense that has made all kinds of opposing quarterbacks sparkle this season, but while many weren't looking, J.J. McCarthy had his most efficient and encouraging performance of the season on Sunday. Derailed by injuries and ineffectiveness to this point in his career, McCarthy put together a good showing on which to build. He moved around efficiently, didn't throw the ball into harm's way and generally made quicker, smarter decisions. And though Justin Jefferson was quiet again, McCarthy leaned heavily on his tight ends. That and a lights-out game defensively appeared to stun the home crowd after four straight losses. Other than the dip in draft position that resulted from this win, McCarthy playing a good game can only be viewed as a positive development.

We had fully bought into the Bengals' absurd and improbable playoff dream, but it almost certainly required holding on for victory Sunday against the Bills. Up 10 with eight minutes left, Joe Burrow was picked twice (on two of the shorter, stranger INTs you'll see on back-to-back passes), and Cincinnati allowed two quick TD drives to completely flip the game. The Bengals made their own bed with a disastrous string of games while Burrow was hurt, so blaming him after Sunday's two rather unlucky plays feels like a giant stretch. For most of the game, he matched Josh Allen blow for blow. Eventually, the Bengals must figure out how to avoid an early-season meltdown, lest they might perpetually find themselves in ""There's always next year"" mode.

Sunday's depressing defeat guaranteed that the Falcons will finish with a losing record, but honestly, that has felt clinched for a few weeks now. They're also 2-4 in Atlanta, with a home date left against the Rams. There just aren't many things to get excited about now, especially with DROY candidate Jalon Walker leaving the game with a quad injury. Bijan Robinson lost a fumble in the red zone, Kirk Cousins was picked twice and the special teams melted down for a second straight game, with a blocked field goal and a 100-yard TD allowed on a kickoff return, giving Seattle the momentum it needed to get going. Rookie James Pearce Jr. stepped up and played well, which is great, but then you remember where Atlanta's traded first-rounder is likely to land -- in the top 10 -- and it's depressing all over again.

Tyler Shough hasn't been amazing, but he's played well enough for the Saints to consider him as the possible starter in 2026. Even with an interception and limited passing success in Sunday's win over Tampa, Shough dealt well with heavy pressure and made big plays with his legs on his first two career rushing TDs. The rookie has looked pretty composed in leading two Saints victories in his five starts, and the Saints might have a chance to finish with five or six total Ws. It might be foolish at this moment to simply hand Shough the starting job next year. But this feels a little different than, say, when Desmond Ridder -- another former Day 2 pick -- finished his rookie season with a solid four-game opportunity for the 2022 Falcons, winning a few games down the stretch and needing only to beat out Taylor Heinicke for the starting job in Atlanta the next season.

That’s now three contests, each roughly a month apart, where Jayden Daniels has left a game he started with injury. It’s fair to wonder if we’ll see him again in 2025, because why would we? Entering the season, he was viewed as the crown jewel of an ascending franchise that went 12-5 and reached the NFC Championship Game, and now the Commanders are suddenly in the mix for the No. 1 overall pick. Eight straight losses will have that kind of effect on a team. Throw in Zach Ertz 's torn ACL, and the suffering only has gotten worse. Dan Quinn was a Coach of the Year candidate last season, but he has had no solutions for the Commanders’ issues, which suddenly run deep and wide. This is going to be a fascinating offseason for this wayward team.

With Arizona's fifth straight loss (and 10th in 11 games) and the news that Kyler Murray won't return this season, it feels like we could be headed for another organizational shift of some note in the offseason. It's not clear who will survive and who'll be deemed expendable, but changes figure to come after a lost season. For the glass-half-full folks, yes, there have been more close losses than embarrassments this season, but we half-empty people also can't help but notice how three of the past five defeats have come via blowout, with 41 or more points allowed in each. This after the defense was provided a lot of resources last offseason. In a stacked NFC West, the Cardinals just can't compete as they're currently constructed.

Brady Cook was thrown into a tough spot in his NFL debut after Tyrod Taylor left with a groin injury, asked to pull the Jets out of a 21-0 hole without many weapons or good protection. The Jets' special teams did their part, but the other two units came up way short in the loss to Miami. Cook certainly missed a few throws against the Dolphins, including a pair of red-zone picks, but his receivers didn't do him many favors, either. Taylor isn't the Jets' future. Justin Fields probably isn't, either. And Cook has a long way to go just to prove he deserves a roster spot next summer. So, the Jets almost certainly will focus their energies on solving the long-running QB concern this team has been dealing with for, well, decades. The Jets are currently slotted to pick fifth in the 2026 NFL Draft, and there's no guarantee they can get the right one there, although it helps that a few teams above them might already have their quarterbacks rostered. Not to mention, New York has a second first-rounder to play with, thanks to the Sauce Gardner trade.

Shedeur Sanders is still only completing 52.4 percent of his passes, and his stressed-out prayer throw into traffic -- which was predictably intercepted -- is the kind of play he'll need to work out of his system as he grows into NFL quarterbacking. But Sanders has provided more high notes than lows to this point, adding a clever rushing touchdown, with two of his three TD passes being absolute beauties. He hasn't done enough to be anointed anything after this season, but it's very tough to say he hasn't earned this shot to start for the rest of the year -- and Sanders had nothing to do with the second disastrous two-point try that prevented the Browns from tying the game late. The defense's failure to hem in the Titans' run game was one of the stranger developments of the season. Then again, losing in disappointing fashion is old hat for these Browns.

Coming off a pretty humbling loss, even by 2-11 team standards, the Giants had an interesting bye week. GM Joe Schoen took some bullets during a pretty stressful press conference -- hat tip to him for taking it like a man and accepting blame. It seems for now that Schoen will return in 2026, although no final decisions have been made. On Sunday, two of the Giants' QBs did the pre-game circuit, hamming for the cameras -- and no, Jaxson Dart was not one of them. He's had a really promising rookie season and is probably the biggest feather Schoen has in his cap, even with other high-end talents on injured reserve. How the Giants play out the string against, presumably, four non-playoff teams will tell us a lot about how the subsequent offseason could look.

Someone will have to explain to me how a Titans rushing offense that ranked 32nd entering Week 14 racked up 184 yards -- tied for the most the Browns have allowed in a game this season -- against a unit that is barely allowing 100 yards on the ground per game even after Sunday. Whatever the case, the Titans put forth their best all-around effort of the season, functionally good in all three phases. Yes, Cam Ward had a pick and averaged only 4.2 yards per pass attempt; he also threw two impressive TD passes and avoided the huge mistakes. Cleveland gifted the Titans two short-field touchdowns, but Tennessee's defense showed up when it needed to most, and it was a gutsy outing for a team that has been through the ringer. Mike McCoy certainly had to enjoy that one after losing his first six games as interim coach by a combined 80 points.

I preemptively moved Las Vegas into the cellar a couple weeks ago, even though Tennessee had a worse record, and it was one of my smarter calls of the season. Not to dance on the Raiders' grave or anything, but even after a moderately respectable showing against Denver, they still looked eons away from truly competing on Sunday. Hey, at least Vegas didn't turn the ball over once for the first time since Week 3. But the run game remains anemic, putting a lot of pressure on the Raiders to figure out how to unlock Ashton Jeanty going forward. The Raiders somehow ran for 240 yards against the Bears in Week 4 but have just 232 rush yards combined in the past five games.

Despite taking some big hits and smacking his head on the ground during the game, Higgins made it through the team's fourth-quarter loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.

But a day later, Higgins is once again in the concussion protocol, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Higgins was involved in at least two plays where he appeared to slam his head on the ground while being taken down. The first came fairly early in the contest, as Higgins jumped to try and make a one-handed catch on a sideline ball. Higgins was able to tip the ball, but couldn't come up with the catch. As he fell to the ground, Higgins' head snapped back and whipped off the grass.

He entered the blue medical tent on the sideline following the hit, but was able to return to the game.

Later, however, Higgins once again smacked his head on the ground while being tackled after a catch. This time around, Higgins sat up and immediately put his hands to his head, a sign he was in pain.

Despite both hits, Higgins was allowed to keep playing. After the game, Higgins was asked about remaining in the game after both hits. He responded by saying he's ""a soldier"" who can take hits.

While Higgins didn't appear to be dealing with any side effects from the hits during that interview, that changed later in the day. Higgins later reported concussion-like symptoms, leading to the wideout once again being placed in the league's concussion protocol.

Higgins finished Week 14 with six catches for 92 yards and two touchdowns in the 39-34 loss to the Bills.

Given the proximity of both brain injuries, Higgins is likely to miss time, if not the rest of the season due to the injury. With their loss in Week 14, the Bengals now sit at 4-9. Cincinnati hasn't been eliminated from playoff contention just yet, but the team would need a lot to go right down the stretch to secure a playoff spot. With little to play for, the Bengals may opt to let Higgins rest up so he can be fully healthy entering next season.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dsMALdwO_AtPFT1LOMCvLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/7e171e90-d472-11f0-bb5f-500f16b60824,N,,2025-12-09 17:03:07.046666

Mike Tomlin, J.J. McCarthy and Shedeur Sanders were among the figures who bounced back in a big way in NFL Week 14.

Week 14 in the NFL necessitated an acceptance of some challenging conditions.

The December weather forced several teams to adapt, with snow or rain altering game plans in several different matchups. But several other tilts also tested franchises in a different fashion, as some key injuries – none more notable than Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones going down with what was later confirmed to be a torn Achilles – and surprising dynamics significantly shifted any emerging sense of order in the playoff picture.

Here are the biggest winners and losers from Sunday's Week 14 action:

NFL Week 14 winners

Mike Tomlin

Following a week where so many were eager to speculate about his future, the stoic Pittsburgh Steelers coach once again let his team do the talking with a narrative-countering 27-22 win over the Baltimore Ravens. There were plenty of familiar elements for Pittsburgh, including the pass rush delivering in a key spot when Alex Highsmith sacked Lamar Jackson as time expired. But the Steelers also broke through by actually putting together a downfield passing attack, as Aaron Rodgers looked his best in years while completing three passes of more than 20 air yards, according to Next Gen Stats. Some perspective is needed given that the offense went cold down the stretch with four three-and-outs in the fourth quarter, and Pittsburgh was outgained 420-318. But the Steelers still delivered a pointed message, which Rodgers said might mean ""maybe you guys (the media) will shut the hell up for a week."" And if his team's statement wasn't enough, Tomlin seemed to drive it home by blowing a kiss to the CBS camera right after the conclusion of the game.

Green Bay Packers

Matt LaFleur said there was no personal satisfaction in beating Ben Johnson after the Chicago Bears' first-year coach said at his introductory news conference in January that he had enjoyed defeating the Packers coach twice a year while with the Detroit Lions. Still, LaFleur's maneuver in the postgame handshake resembled Micah Parsons dispatching an overmatched offensive lineman with a swim move. The Packers put the overachieving Bears in their place with a 28-21 win that handed back the NFC North lead and affirmed Green Bay's supremacy in the cutthroat division. An offense that was with its top five receivers for the first time all season showed off its potential, with Christian Watson hauling in two touchdowns from Jordan Love. But where the two teams are most divergent are in their defenses. While Chicago's group is adept at generating turnovers, Green Bay truly throws opponents off their rhythm, which the unit again managed to do against Caleb Williams. The Bears will have a chance for a response at home in two weeks, but it might be another year before Johnson and Co. can truly measure up.

Buffalo Bills' late flurries

This is not a reference to the snow that covered the field throughout the close call against the Cincinnati Bengals. Rather, it was the rapid accumulation of fourth-quarter points – 21 in under five minutes – that changed the forecast for Buffalo in a 39-34 win. Games in these conditions can produce some outlier outcomes, so it's wise not to try to make too much of the outcome. But the Bills pounced on two uncharacteristic interceptions thrown by Joe Burrow in an otherwise outstanding performance by the quarterback, and Josh Allen again carried the offense in the unit's time of need. There's no telling what version of Buffalo will show up on a drive-by-drive basis, but this is likely the most dangerous of the AFC wild-card contenders.

Shedeur Sanders

It's unlikely that the cellar-dweller tilt between the Cleveland Browns and Tennessee Titans will have many more ramifications beyond shaping the top of the 2026 NFL Draft order. But despite his day coming to a confounding end when he was sidelined for the Browns' game-deciding botched two-point conversion, Sanders made meaningful strides in his third start. There were still several setbacks, including a costly third-quarter interception. And his proclivity for holding onto the ball remains untenable, with his 3.57-second average time to throw representing the second-highest mark for any quarterback this season, according to Next Gen Stats. But for whatever pressure he invites and exacerbates, Sanders also gives the offense and its small collection of promising pieces the chance to grow. With Cleveland squandering the brilliance of Myles Garrett and the defensive end's pursuit of NFL history, the Browns can at least see this season out while putting up the sort of fight they couldn't muster in the fall.

Tyler Shough

When the New Orleans Saints handed their offense to Shough for the rest of the season after a 1-7 start, they at least gave their fans a reason to stay invested in a campaign of stalled growth. The second-round rookie quarterback is rewarding the organization with enough sparks to start a conversation about whether he can hold down the role for at least another year. Shough reeled off two impressive touchdown runs – the first coming on a 34-yard designed run, the latter an even more impressive 13-yard scramble – to power a 24-20 upset of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Neither play was the sort of outcome the Saints should expect the 6-5, 219-pounder to be able to replicate, but both were vital on a rain-soaked day in which New Orleans was again without running back Alvin Kamara. Consistency is still difficult to come by, but if Shough continues along this trajectory, he will be hard to shunt aside for a first-round rookie passer.

J.J. McCarthy

One isolated performance against an undermanned Washington Commanders defense won't single-handedly shift the season-long narrative surrounding the struggling quarterback, but McCarthy and the Minnesota Vikings need to cling to any signs of progress given how infrequently they've popped up. The second-year signal-caller finally exhibited some composure in a 31-0 rout, throwing for a season-high three touchdowns and averaging just 2.56 seconds to throw, his quickest mark of the year, according to Next Gen Stats. Not plagued by the protection problems that have become more pervasive as the season has dragged on, Minnesota was able to incorporate its tight ends more into the passing attack rather than forcing them to block or chip. The result had all three of McCarthy's scoring strikes going to players at the position - two to Josh Oliver and another to T.J. Hockenson - on a day when the rushing attack led the way with 162 yards on 34 carries. The Vikings can't expect things to remain this easy for the young passer, but the next two games against the Cowboys and Giants will provide opportunities to rebuild some confidence and establish a path forward before the degree of difficulty ramps up considerably in the final two weeks with tilts against the Lions and Packers.

NFL Week 14 losers

Kansas City Chiefs

If the Chiefs end up missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014 - three years before Patrick Mahomes was drafted and just the second season under Andy Reid's watch - Sunday night's 20-10 loss to the Houston Texans will serve as a fitting encapsulation of all the ways in which this year's team came up short.

The Texans' top-ranked defense doesn't depend on deception or inordinate blitzing. It's all the more galling, then, for opponents to be subdued by a group that simply comes out and denies almost everything, overwhelming offensive lines with its front four while its secondary locks down things on the back end.

In as close as a Week 14 game can be to a must-win affair, Kansas City wasn't outfoxed. It was simply overmatched.

The Chiefs once again left Mahomes to try to sling them to victory despite entering the game without three starting offensive linemen and later losing another. Yet time and again, the quarterback's supporting cast failed to rise to the moment. The most devastating drop came late in the fourth quarter, when Travis Kelce bobbled a pass that would then be intercepted by Texans linebacker Azeez Al-Shaair, extinguishing any shot at a late rally.

Despite his best efforts, Mahomes finished with the worst completion rate (42.4%) and passer rating (19.8) of his career, while his three interceptions also tied a personal low.

Any optimism surrounding Kansas City this season has largely stemmed from the notion that it was only a matter of time before this core flipped a switch and reached its previous heights. But the end of the Chiefs' nine-year reign atop the AFC West – cemented Sunday with the loss – indicates that this new and undesirable era has really arrived.

There's still a path to the postseason, but things are stacking up extremely unfavorably for Kansas City, which can't count on tiebreakers against the Texans, Bills and Jaguars, who all are ahead of them in the AFC pecking order. Whenever the season ends, it might be time for the franchise's most serious overhaul since the Super Bowl 55 beatdown by the Buccaneers.

A run game that lacks any kind of explosiveness should be completely reconfigured so as to recalibrate an attack that too often pushed everything on Mahomes' plate. The largely dormant pass rush ranks among the most pressing problems, with the group unable to get home against C.J. Stroud even when it was able to generate pressure. And the longstanding issues in the receiving corps seem as pervasive as ever.

Daniel Jones and the Indianapolis Colts

""It's not looking good,"" Colts coach Shane Steichen said of Jones' Achilles injury that knocked the quarterback out of Sunday's 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. And while Steichen was speaking strictly about his starting signal-caller's medical outlook, his words are also applicable to the football prognosis for both Jones and the Colts, both in the short and long term.

With Steichen confirming Monday that Jones suffered a torn Achilles that will end the signl-caller's season, Indianapolis has a crisis on its hands for the last four weeks of the regular season. Having lost four of their last five games, the Colts now face the prospect of trying to seize a wild-card berth – the AFC South crown all but out of reach – with a sixth-round rookie quarterback in Riley Leonard at the helm. And the schedule brings a final slate of games likely to render Indianapolis the underdog in each contest.

The Colts offense was already coming down from its early-season peak after the unit led the league in scoring en route to a 7-1 mark. But reproducing that efficiency seems even more outlandish with defenses now able to load up even more against Jonathan Taylor in an effort to force Leonard to be a consistent downfield thrower.

The upcoming offseason, however, is where things truly get complicated for Jones and the Colts. The quarterback figured to score a massive payday once his deal expired after this season, with Indianapolis having a strong incentive to bring him back. A torn Achilles, however, would likely leave Jones uncertain for at least the start of next season in even the most optimistic of recovery timelines.

Would Indianapolis still be willing to pay a sizable sum – or use the franchise tag – given the uncertainty? There aren't many good alternatives for the Colts after they dealt away their first-round draft picks for the next two years in a clear commitment to building around this offense and Jones. But Indianapolis was forging ahead at a time when it looked as though it could capitalize on a wide-open AFC field. Now, if the Colts fall in all of their remaining contests, they'll end up at 8-9 – the exact same mark they held last year before late owner Jim Irsay gave Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard a one-year reprieve. And if defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo lands a head-coaching gig elsewhere, Indianapolis will almost be back at square one as it commits to recreating magic that dissipated long ago.

Baltimore Ravens

Did everyone panic about the wrong AFC North team? The Ravens' Thanksgiving stumble was largely overlooked once the Steelers seized the spotlight with their struggles days later, but Baltimore has raised serious concerns as it fell behind Pittsburgh in the divisional pecking order. Yes, Isaiah Likely's overturned touchdown loomed large in a close game that featured close calls that didn't go the Ravens' way. But there's no need to indulge in conspiracy theories or hypotheticals when the offense simply started slow and went just 2-for-6 in the red zone, settling for three field goals and coming up short on a turnover on downs on the others. Meanwhile, the defense regressed to its decrepit earlier form, with a particularly debilitating coverage breakdown coming on an easy Jaylen Warren screen for a touchdown, among other miscues. Baltimore still might have a chance to reclaim the division so long as Pittsburgh doesn't wrap things up before the Week 18 rematch. At this rate, however, the Ravens simply don't look suited for the postseason.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers

The Buccaneers should be thankful that there's no NFL Playoff Selection Committee. Any such entity would probably try to omit this group from the postseason, regardless of their finish within the division. With Sunday's setback against New Orleans, Tampa Bay has now lost five of its last seven games and dropped into a tie atop the NFC South with the Carolina Panthers at 7-6. Any sloppiness can't merely be chalked up to the soggy conditions, as Baker Mayfield again was out of sorts. The Bucs had a distinct scheduling advantage in the final five weeks, but the loss essentially rendered that moot given the looming matchups with Carolina in Weeks 16 and 18. A fifth consecutive division crown is hardly a given.

Washington Commanders

Being eliminated from playoff contention wasn't a massive letdown in and of itself, as Washington was already starting down a lost season long before Sunday. But the fashion in which the Commanders suffered their shutout loss since 2019 was a sobering reminder of how far the organization has tumbled in a short time. In a meeting of NFC powers from last season that had both come undone in 2025, it was the Commanders who were unable to find any sort of toehold as they dropped their eighth consecutive game. Jayden Daniels' return from a dislocated elbow figured to invigorate the offense, but Washington had no answers for Brian Flores' defense, which surrendered just 206 total yards. Daniels exited the game in the third quarter after aggravating his elbow injury, though coach Dan Quinn said the second-year quarterback could have returned. While Quinn maintained he plans to keep playing Daniels for the rest of the year, Washington might soon need to revisit that school of thought to prevent this season's calamitous run from extending into 2026.

With starter Daniel Jones out for the season because of a torn right Achilles and backup Riley Leonard dealing with a knee injury, the Colts could, shockingly, turn to retired NFL great Philip Rivers as an emergency solution.

Indianapolis brought in Rivers, who last played in the NFL in 2020 with the Colts, for a workout Monday night, a source told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler on Tuesday. Rivers threw the ball well, the source told Fowler, but the Colts haven't yet decided to sign him, and Rivers has yet to determine whether he would play, a source said.

Rivers is currently a semifinalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame's Class of 2026. Per the Hall of Fame, if Rivers signs to the Colts' practice squad that would have no effect on his eligibility. However, if he signs to the Colts' active roster his eligibility clock would reset, whether or not he takes a snap in a game, and he wouldn't be eligible again until 2031.

Though it's unclear if Rivers, who turned 44 on Monday, is in football shape after his long layoff, he would have intimate knowledge of the Colts' offensive scheme, and his working relationship with coach Shane Steichen would be seamless. They worked closely during Steichen's days as the Los Angeles Chargers' offensive coordinator before Rivers' one season with the Colts.

The Colts believe Rivers' familiarity could give them a realistic chance to stay competitive.

He was impressive in his final season with the Colts in 2020. Indianapolis finished 11-5 with Rivers under center, making the playoffs as an AFC wild card. The Colts lost to the Buffalo Bills in a first-round game and, several weeks later, Rivers retired. No Colts team since that 2020 squad has averaged more than the 253.3 passing yards produced by Rivers.

Indianapolis won four of its last five games that season to clinch a playoff spot. And Rivers delivered throughout the season, completing 68% of his pass attempts and throwing 24 touchdown passes.

The Colts' possible signing of Rivers indicates the desperation of their desperate. Jones had been enjoying a career year in his first season in Indianapolis, but he had struggled amid a left fibula stress fracture in recent games. On Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Jones tore his right Achilles in a noncontact injury.

Leonard finished the game and was expected to fill in the rest of the season. But Steichen said Leonard, a sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame, reported an unspecified knee issue to the team's medical staff Monday morning. A source later told ESPN's Schefter that Leonard had a strained knee ligament and was considered week-to-week. The Colts said it was unclear whether Leonard would be available for Sunday's road game against the Seattle Seahawks.

With former first-round pick Anthony Richardson Sr. also on injured reserve, the Colts have only journeyman quarterback Brett Rypien on their practice squad.

The Colts (8-5) are sitting just outside the AFC playoff field, losing a tiebreaker for the final spot with the Houston Texans. Indianapolis has four games remaining in the regular season, against the Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars and Texans.

Rivers has not played in the NFL since the 2020 season with the Colts.

He has a close relationship with Colts head coach Shane Steichen from their time with the Chargers.

Faced with a dire situation at quarterback, the Indianapolis Colts aare reportedly thinking about turning to Uncle Phil.

Indianapolis brought in Philip Rivers for a workout, a league source confirmed to IndyStar on Monday night, in the wake of a season-ending injury to starting quarterback Daniel Jones and a knee injury to backup Riley Leonard, the rookie who took over for Jones on Sunday in Jacksonville.

When Leonard showed up at the team facility on Monday, the sixth-round pick was dealing with an injury to his right knee, an injury the Colts were still evaluating when head coach Shane Steichen held his typical media availability on Monday.

If Leonard isn’t able to play on Sunday, Indianapolis has only one healthy quarterback in the building. Veteran quarterback Brett Rypien has been a part of the practice squad since Anthony Richardson suffered a broken orbital bone.

Steichen indicated the Colts were already exploring players to add.

“We'll see how it goes,” Steichen said about the possibility of Rypien starting in place of an injured Leonard. “I mean, right now, that'll be the guy that's on our roster. So, like I said, we're working through those situations right now.”

Enter Rivers, the legend who celebrated his 44th birthday on Monday and hasn’t played since leading the Colts to the playoffs in 2020. He signed a one-day contract in July to retire with the Chargers.

Rivers has spent the past five seasons as the head coach of St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Ala.; the Cardinals lost a state semifinal to Jackson on Thanksgiving weekend, freeing Rivers to pursue the possibility of helping out a couple of old friends.

His relationship with the Colts is obvious. Rivers is the last Indianapolis quarterback to lead the Colts to the playoffs, throwing for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in 2020.

The legend left an indelible mark on the franchise. Five years later, everybody from players to general manager Chris Ballard who were in Indianapolis with Rivers still reference the legendary quarterback, affectionately calling him “Uncle Phil.”

But his relationship with Steichen runs even deeper.

Steichen spent seven of his first eight seasons as a member of the Chargers organization. From the start, he hit it off with Rivers, another football junkie who had a habit of staying up late during organized team activities in the offseason, talking football with each other deep into the night, even though Steichen was a defensive assistant at first.

“I just kind of naturally gravitated toward where Shane was,” Rivers told IndyStar in 2023. “For me, it was fun because I was talking to another quarterback mind, and for him, I think it was fun, because he was stuck with the defensive guys.”

When Steichen returned to the Chargers after a one-year stint with Cleveland, he was back on the offensive side of the ball, serving first as the team’s wide receivers coach and then four seasons as the quarterbacks coach to Rivers, going toe-to-toe with the legend in the quarterback competitions Rivers held at the end of each practice.

“I got a special kick out of it, because at the time, I would throw last, because we always went youngest to oldest,” Rivers said. “I’d be like, ‘Shane, I’m after you, get in there.’”

The two men have stayed close in the years since Rivers retired. Steichen frequently references conversations with Rivers, two head coaches talking ball together, the way they did for so many years in California.

A reunion now is unconventional. Only four quarterbacks have started in the NFL at age 44 or older: Tom Brady, Vinny Testaverde, Warren Moon and Steve DeBerg.

But Rivers knows Steichen’s offense inside and out, speaks the head coach’s language and kept the flame of a potential return alive as long as possible.

Rivers has been mentioned as a potential late-season replacement for a couple of teams since retirement, most notably the San Francisco 49ers. Kyle Shanahan told reporters that Rivers was San Francisco’s Super Bowl contingency plan in 2023 during a rash of playoff injuries that decimated the 49ers quarterbacks.

If Leonard isn’t able to play against Seattle, the Colts have precious few options to start. The trade deadline has long passed, limiting their options to pick up a player like former backup and current Bengal Joe Flacco. Indianapolis could try to poach a practice-squad player like Sam Ehlinger from Denver, but Ehlinger has reportedly turned down other 53-man spots to stay with the Broncos, and teams can raise the salaries of practice-squad players to keep them around.

With few options available, Indianapolis is going to see what Rivers still has left in his right arm.

The Colts already know Rivers is a fit everywhere else.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/presto/2020/11/13/PIND/01ab1692-b35d-45a5-84a1-8f98eac568a9-47_coltstitans_RS.JPG?crop=2399,1350,x0,y0&width=2399&height=1350&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-09 11:08:32.144537

Walking it back

The NFL has admitted that its officials got an important call wrong during the Steelers’ 27-22 win over the Baltimore Ravens.

That’s according to Baltimore head coach John Harbaugh. He told the media Monday that the Ravens got a phone call from the league telling the club that the referees were incorrect when they penalized defensive tackle Travis Jones for unnecessary roughness on Steelers long snapper Christian Kuntz during a field goal rush in the first half.

“It was the wrong call. It should not have been called,” Harbaugh said via the team’s website, adding that the league permitted him to disclose that information.

During the broadcast, and again on WDVE on Monday, CBS rules analyst Gene Steratore had a similar assessment.

That said, Harbaugh found no such satisfaction while seeking clarification on the two plays that involved possession of a catch — an overturned touchdown by tight end Isaiah Likely, and an overturned interception of a batted pass thrown by Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers.

“It’s about as clear as mud right now,” Harbaugh said of the catch rule.

“It’s very hard to understand how they get overturned. But they did. And that’s where it stands.”

The Ravens are now 6-7, a game behind Pittsburgh for first place in the AFC North with one head-to-head contest remaining in Week 18.

Trending to play

One challenge facing the Steelers on Monday night in their next game against Miami will be containing Dolphins star running back De’Von Achane. He has 1,126 rushing yards, third-most in the NFL.

The 24-year-old Texas A&M product had 92 yards and a touchdown versus the New York Jets on Sunday.

However, Achane suffered a rib injury during the game and was limited to just seven carries. Jaylen Wright soaked up most of the rushing duties and went off for 107 yards and a touchdown on 24 attempts.

On Monday, head coach Mike McDaniel said that Achane had imaging done after the game. No fracture was detected, and the running back is “highly motivated” to play in Pittsburgh.

Miami’s rushing offense is No. 8 in the NFL at 126.5 yards per game. The Steelers have allowed 249 yards and 217 yards in back-to-back games on the ground against Buffalo and Baltimore.

Keep ’em coming

The Penguins are continuing their tough streak of opponents when the Anaheim Ducks fly into PPG Paints Arena on Tuesday night.

They lead the Pacific Division with 37 points. This game is on the heels of the Penguins beating Tampa Bay, 4-3, on Thursday. The Lightning were atop the Atlantic Division at the time and are currently in second place.

Then Dan Muse’s club went to Dallas and lost in a shootout 3-2. The Stars have 45 points, second most in the NHL. Only Central Division rival Colorado (48) has more.

The Ducks have won three of their past four games, including a 7-1 win over Chicago on Sunday. However, the one loss in that bunch of games was a 7-0 defeat against Utah.

Anaheim averages 3.59 goals per game. Only Colorado (3.97) averages more. However, the Ducks allow 3.28 goals per game. They rank 23rd in goal prevention.

The Penguins are in the top Eastern Conference wild card spot with 34 points in 27 games. They’ve gathered points in three straight contests and six of their last seven.

This is the first of five straight home games for the Pens. Montreal, San Jose, Utah and Edmonton all come to town between Tuesday night and Dec. 16.

All or nothing

Speaking of the Penguins, there are some very specific Tristan Jarry trade rumors floating around.

There have long been rumblings that the Edmonton Oilers may want to acquire the Pittsburgh goalie. But according to Elliotte Friedman on his “32 Thoughts” podcast, Penguins general manager Kyle Dubas won’t deal Jarry unless the Oilers absorb his entire cap hit of $5.375 million over the next three years.

“The Penguins have made it very clear that if they were going to do this, there was going to be no retention,” Friedman said. “That’s going to be very hard for them to do. The Oilers are capped tight. Right now, they’ve got a lot of injuries, and guys just in and out. They’re barely carrying extra players. Their roster is stuck. So they really couldn’t do a lot of stuff, even if they wanted to.”

The Oilers have 31 points. Currently, that’s good for a Western Conference wild card spot. But their goals-against-per-game average of 3.45 is 28th in the NHL.

Jarry is 9-2-1 this season with a 2.54 GAA and a save percentage of .913.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/12/9113437_web1_AP25320647847814.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 11:08:37.061290

“Without the protection of a helmet, young football players are disincentivized to lead with their head while performing tackling drills in practice.
Furthermore, recent research shows that the excessive padding that is commonplace in the NFL today may not reduce injury in the first place.
Why do NFL players wear so much padding?
Many NFL players have begun to opt out of wearing knee pads for this reason.","When evaluating injury risk in the National Football League (NFL), one might imagine that the solution to avoid greater injury lies in introducing rules that punish aggressive actions, ensuring ethical ways of playing and the use of proper equipment or protection. While all of those are true, one important way to reduce injury is not immediately evident: the reduction of padding, such as helmets, shoulder, or leg pads.

Although that concept might in fact seem somewhat backwards, the reduction of protective equipment would actually make gameplay safer, making players focus on safer techniques of tackling and, in fact, reducing injury rates, as the padding itself can and does contribute to riskier behavior from the players.

Associate Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Union College, Chad Orzel, acknowledges that although the idea might seem counterintuitive, the argument is rooted in logic.

“The armor worn by American football players gives them a false sense of invincibility, leading them to fling their bodies around in ways that make serious injuries more likely,” Orzel wrote in a Forbes article.

Football is a high-contact sport that puts players at risk for serious injuries and many developments have been made to the NFL since its inception in 1920. Football helmets were not mandated in the league until 1943, with the prior standard being leather helmets. As more discoveries are made about safety in the sport, changes must be implemented to preserve and protect those who partake in this great American pastime.

Padding in this way gives players a false sense of invincibility and, in that way, makes them more injury-prone. More padding lowers the pain factor for more risky hits.

Some high school programs opt not to use helmets in practice to teach their players better technique.

“Without the protection of a helmet, young football players are disincentivized to lead with their head while performing tackling drills in practice. Thus, they’re instead forced to use proper technique — wrapping up with their arms and leading with their shoulders — when going up against a tackling sled or performing a similar tackling drill,” Education Week contributing writer Bryan Toporek wrote in an article.

Some argue that there is a mental shift when helmets are on as well, claiming that players view the helmet as “armament” and therefore see these protections as weapons rather than “armor” or protection.

Furthermore, recent research shows that the excessive padding that is commonplace in the NFL today may not reduce injury in the first place. A study conducted by Stanford University found that, in observing football practices, the helmet in fact failed to show a significant reduction in the impact from blows.

Why do NFL players wear so much padding? A change may be necessary

The question then remains: if the helmet does not significantly reduce injury and can instead inversely increase the likelihood of injury by encouraging unsafe practices, is the padding worth it?

Padding also reduces mobility and agility, which can not only affect gameplay but also safety in terms of reaction. Many NFL players have begun to opt out of wearing knee pads for this reason. Ironically, the more gear that one assumes, the more danger they may find themselves in.

Alternatives to ensuring safety in football may be in practice, not in padding. A study conducted at the University of New Hampshire found that practicing without a helmet, as the high school team did in the earlier example, may reduce injuries on the field.

Without helmets, players would learn to tackle as rugby players do, “with proper form that spares their heads from concussions and lowers the risk of debilitating long-term health problems like chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which plagues many former NFL players,” a GQ Sports article says.

A study conducted by Cornell University also posits a change to the design of the helmets that does not prioritize greater padding but smarter materials, such as liquid shock absorption helmets, to reduce impact.

Football is inherently a dangerous and aggressive sport. As such, all should be done to protect this pastime and its players.","https://www.fsunews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/08/PFSU/87665379007-football-padding-graphic.png?crop=2303,1296,x0,y288&width=2303&height=1296&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-09 13:02:13.581236

The Colts never confirmed reports Jones played with a broken fibula.","INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indianapolis Colts are considering going old school with their top two quarterbacks injured.

Just hours after coach Shane Steichen confirmed Monday that Daniel Jones would miss the rest of this season with a torn right Achilles tendon and that backup Riley Leonard injured his right knee in Sunday’s loss at Jacksonville, a person with knowledge of the details told The Associated Press that 44-year-old Philip Rivers is heading to Indy for a tryout Tuesday. The person requested anonymity because an official announcement had not been made.

Rivers has not taken a snap since 2020 when he played his final NFL season with the Colts. He led Indy to the playoffs that season and they’ve returned to the postseason since. Rivers announced his retirement in January 2021 and has spent the past five seasons coaching St. Michael High School in Fairhope, Alabama.

Strangely, Leonard also played high school football in Fairhope.

While it’s unclear how much time Rivers would need to learn the playbook or get in game shape, he did work with Steichen when they were both with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers. He also worked with Indiana Hoosiers coach Curt Cignetti when they were both at North Carolina State.

It’s a desperate move for a team that doesn’t have many options after losing three straight games and four of their last five, their playoff hopes rapidly fading away.

Jones was injured in the first half of Sunday’s 36-19 loss in rainy Jacksonville. He crumpled to the ground, reaching toward his calf despite not being hit on the play. Jones then slammed his helmet into the ground before limping off the field and into the locker room. He returned to the sideline in the second half with a walking boot protecting his lower right leg.

Following the game, Steichen acknowledged the initial diagnosis was not good and that it could be season-ending. Less than 24 hours later, Steichen gave updates about both injuries.

“He’ll have surgery within the week,” Steichen said, referring to Jones. “Obviously, just really feel for him, just an unfortunate situation. The work he puts in, the grind, a team captain for us. One of the toughest guys I’ve ever been around. Just praying for a speedy recovery for him.”

It’s a major blow for Jones, who resuscitated his career with an incredibly strong first eight games in his first season with Indy. Jones played so well, his name entered MVP discussion as his price tag in free agency continued to climb.

Losing Jones may prove more problematic for the Colts (8-5), who visit Seattle (10-3) next weekend before closing out the season with home games against San Francisco (9-4) and Jacksonville (9-4) and a visit to Houston (8-5).

Then came the surprise news — Leonard arrived at the team complex Monday with his own injury. He replaced Jones on Sunday, going 18 of 29 for 145 yards and one interception in his most extensive action since Notre Dame lost last year’s national championship game. Steichen couldn’t say yet if Leonard would play at Seattle, but the Colts have limited options in the building.

“He came in with a knee (injury) this morning so we’re working through that right now. That’s what I’ve got right now,” Steichen said before addressing Leonard’s playing status. “Hopefully, that’s the hope. We’ll see how it goes.”

If Leonard can’t play, veteran Brett Rypien could be next in line even though he was signed to the practice squad in mid-October but is not yet on the active roster.

Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 overall draft pick in 2023, lost the quarterback competition to Jones in training camp and has not practiced since going on injured reserve with a fractured orbital bone in mid-October.

“He’s not ready yet,” Steichen said when asked about Richardson’s potential return.

As for Jones, he was having a career year.

He went 8-5, going 261 of 348 for 3,101 yards, 19 TDs and eight interceptions while rushing for 164 yards and five more scores.

Jones established a new career high in completion percentage, 68.0%, and fell two wins, 105 yards and five TD passes short of posting new career bests in those categories, too. He also made 13 starts, his most since starting 16 games while leading the New York Giants to the 2022 playoffs.

But he played hurt again this year. Jones used an extra pad on his injured lower left leg in his last three starts. The Colts never confirmed reports Jones played with a broken fibula.

Steichen couldn’t say whether the injured fibula had any impact on Jones’ Achilles tendon.

“I don’t know that,” Steichen said. “I think it’s just a very, very unfortunate situation.”

Rivers was an eight-time Pro Bowl selection who finished ranks the NFL’s career leaders in yards passing with 63,440, 421 touchdown passes and 12 4,000-yard seasons. He made it to the semifinal stage in his first year of eligibility for the Pro Football Hall of Fame last month.

After losing starting quarterback Daniel Jones to an Achilles injury during Sunday's loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, Indy brought Philip Rivers in for a workout on Monday night and ""threw the ball well,"" according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler. The parties are now evaluating subsequent steps, the Colts' battered quarterback room − beyond Jones even − serving as a backdrop of the club's current state of desperation.

Rivers, who turned 44 on Monday, hasn't played since 2020 − which seemed like the last of his 17 seasons in the league and the only one he spent in Indianapolis after 16 years with the San Diego and Los Angeles Chargers. That 2020 campaign, widely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, also marks the last time the Colts reached the postseason.

Rivers, who became eligible for the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year and is currently a semifinalist, was voted to eight Pro Bowls. His 63,440 career passing yards rank seventh in league history, and his 421 touchdown passes are sixth all-time. He led the Chargers to four AFC West titles and two other playoff appearances, guiding them as far as the AFC title game in 2007, but never to a Super Bowl. Including the postseason, Rivers won 139 of his 252 professional starts, including an 11-6 mark in Indianapolis.

Originally selected fourth overall out of North Carolina State by the New York Giants in the 2004 draft, Rivers' rights were traded almost immediately to the Chargers in a draft day deal for Eli Manning, whom the Bolts chose No. 1 overall. Manning had no intention of going to San Diego, but the Chargers got Rivers and a package of picks, including a 2005 first-rounder − which would be used on Pro Bowl pass rusher Shawne Merriman − for their trouble. Rivers owns most of the franchise's significant passing records.

Colts coach Shane Steichen spent nine years as an assistant with the Bolts, including seven on the offensive side of the ball, where he served as Rivers' interim offensive coordinator in 2019.

Rookie Riley Leonard finished the loss at Jacksonville but is now nursing a knee injury. The team is hoping he'll be able to go for Week 15's game at Seattle against the Seahawks, whose 10-3 record is tied for the best in the NFC. Former Colts QB1 Anthony Richardson is on injured reserve with an orbital bone fracture. After a surprising 7-1 start to its season, thanks in large part to revitalized Jones, Indianapolis has lost four of five and fell out of the AFC's projected playoff field Sunday.

Since retiring after the 2020 season, Rivers has coached football at St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama. He is the father of 10 children and has a grandchild as well.

The Seahawks saw rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo exit Sunday's game early due to a knee injury. Nose tackle Brandon Pili was also briefly sidelined by a knee injury but was able to return, and Macdonald said after the game that Pili was OK.

As for Arroyo, Macdonald said they're still working through the specifics of the injury, but that it is unlikely he will play this week.

""Elijah's got a knee,"" Macdonald said. ""Just working through it right now, but I'd say this week's probably in jeopardy for him.""

Macdonald also said that center Jalen Sundell should return to practice this week after missing the last four games on injured reserve due to a knee injury.

""Yeah, Jalen should be back this week, yeah,"" Macdonald said.

Macdonald has praised the play of Olu Oluwatimi in Sundell's absence, and Sundell competed at right guard in camp before settling in at center while Oluwatimi was sidelined by an injury, give the Seahawks some options with how they want to configure their line when he is back.

Asked what the plan was for Sundell when he's back, Macdonald only offered, ""We'll see.""

Macdonald was also asked about Emmanwori, who briefly left the game with an apparent hand injury that was checked out on the sideline, and who quickly returned.

""I haven't heard anything since he went back in the game, so I'm assuming that he's OK,"" Macdonald said. ""I haven't heard anything on that front.""

2. Rashid Shaheed makes the Seahawks more dangerous.

Playing in his fifth game with the Seahawks since arriving in a midseason trade, Rashid Shaheed had his breakout moment, returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown to jumpstart a big second half. Shaheed also had his best game on offense, catching four passes for 67 yards.

Getting Shaheed going and having a player with his speed to play off of Jaxon Smith-Njigba and the rest of Seattle's pass catchers should be a big help to Seattle's offense moving forward.

""That's obviously a huge part of the reason why we decided to trade for him,"" Macdonald said. ""He's another great piece to our offense. We've got a lot of great weapons, including Jax, obviously, our tight end room, our runners, the rest of our wideouts are really talented as well. To me it's like, as a football team, what's our competitive advantage? It's the synergy of the group. It's the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, it's 12 as One, however you want to say it. If you can play together and you can play off of one another all the time and accentuate your teammates' strengths and build your teammates up and help your teammates have success, that's a powerful thing. So if Sheed's going in there and he's blocking in the run game and he's carrying it in some of the receiver run game, and then he's also running the whole route tree and making plays in the pass game, that's just going to make us that more dangerous, which is really cool.""

As for Shaheed's kick return, Macdonald said the play was a great team effort combing good blocking with Shaheed's return skills.

""There were a lot of great blocks,"" Macdonald said. ""Brady (Russell) made a great block—Brady played a phenomenal game on special teams, made a great play on punt. Paddy O (Patrick O'Connell) made a great block on that play. There were a lot of great blocks—I can't single out everybody—then he made a great run as well. It was definitely a team effort. It was a really great play everybody involved.""

3. Assistant coaches had a big hand in Seattle's third-down success.

Seattle's defense has been good on third down all season, but it was particularly dominant on Sunday. The Falcons converted on just one of 13 third-down attempts—their first—and all three takeaways came on third down, with DeMarcus Lawrence forcing a fumble on a third-and-1 run, and with Emmanwori and Devon Witherspoon both intercepting third-down passes.

""I've got to give (defensive passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach) Karl Scott a lot of credit,"" Macdonald said. ""He always has great ideas every week, he does a lot of the third-down game planning for us, and he was convicted about some of the calls we had this past game, and it was great to see those things come to life. And the guys did a great job executing it. Nick's interceptions, that's a defense we don't play that often, and the guys executed it phenomenally well. It was really Karl's idea, and it was great to make it come to life. And then on the short-yardage play, that's (outside linebackers coach) Chris Partridge's area, he does a great job game planning for that, he always has a great plan every week. It gives the guys a lot of confidence, and then at the end of the day, guys have to go make plays and attack the football. We had a funny little TV copy debate on who actually got the ball out, whether it was J-Reed or D-Law on the forced fumble. It turns out DeMarcus beat him by a hair there, so, sorry J-Reed. Next time buddy.""

4. Anthony Bradford had a good game against the Falcons.

In Sunday's game, Seahawks right guard, Anthony Bradford was Seattle's highest graded offensive lineman by Pro Football Focus.

""AB graded out as our highest offensive lineman yesterday,"" Macdonald said. ""He's playing hard, he's got a great punch.""

According to Next Gen Stats, through 34 pass block snaps, Bradford didn't allow a sack and allowed just one quarterback pressure.

""I think his overall confidence is probably at a high point in his career at this point,"" Macdonald added. ""He's practicing really well, he practices hard. He's doing all of those steps that it takes to end up putting good football out on the field.""

While Macdonald said there is room for Bradford to improve in some parts of his game, he said there's, ""a lot"" Bradford is doing well.

""I know there's some plays that minuses or plays that aren't up to par, but there's a lot of great plays as well, and I thought he had a good game yesterday.""

5. When Sam Darnold is clicking, the Seahawks are ""playing really efficient football.""

After what was a quiet first half for Sam Darnold vs. the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday, the second half of the game was a different story. In the first half alone, Darnold completed nine passes for 67 yards and was intercepted once. In the second half, he went 11 for 15 threw for 182 yards and three touchdowns.

""I just thought we got a little bit more in rhythm on offense and it was more successful on first down,"" Macdonald said. ""Had a couple actually get back on track, good plays, explosives. I think it's really that simple, you know. And it's a credit to Sam and our coaches of just, sticking to it, we're going to work through our game plan and make some adjustments and not get frazzled or discouraged or frustrated and just keep hammering away, and then eventually, we'll find some things that start to click. I thought Klint (Kubiak) called a great game in the second half and really set up some great plays. And I thought Sam played really well, especially late in the down. It's really accurate, but it really made some plays there when initially nothing was there, especially on that his last touchdown pass was a phenomenal play.""

Outside of Darnold's one interception, and taking two sacks, he played an otherwise clean game, but Macdonald knows the turnovers are one part of his game he needs to improve on.

Macdonald said, ""If you just look at how many times we turned the ball over, I think we'd all say it's too many. But I think Sam's playing really good football for us. There's a couple plays a game where, we got to protect the ball a bit better. But when Sam's clicking and he has been for the majority of the season, we're playing really efficient football and he's leading the charge for us. So keep plugging away, keep attacking it. Keep slinging the ball and we'll just, again, like every other position, there's always things that correct from a week-to-week basis. Find new things to screw up, we'll keep growing from it together and let's go rock and roll.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/lwqkbyxdk3i11hvnvswh,N,,2025-12-09 11:08:58.404416

The Magic announced that an MRI conducted Monday revealed that the left leg injury Franz Wagner suffered Sunday at Madison Square Garden is a high-ankle sprain — and not an injury to knee ligaments or tendons.

High-ankle sprains can take weeks or months to heal, and the Magic are not publicly putting a timeline on Wagner’s expected recovery, in accordance with team policies related to player injuries. But team officials are thankful that Wagner, a 24-year-old wing/forward who was a potential All-Star candidate, won’t be sidelined for the remainder of the season.

Wagner is one of the key two-way players in the Eastern Conference, if not the league, averaging 22.7 points, 6.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists per game and playing active defense for one of the NBA’s best teams on that end of the court.

When Wagner landed awkwardly on his left leg following a lob attempt on Sunday afternoon, it looked worrisome enough that, at first, it would have been easy to conclude his season could be over. That would have essentially derailed Orlando’s hopes for a top-four finish in the East and raised the likelihood of a first-round playoff exit.

But X-rays taken at Madison Square Garden ruled out any fractures, a team official told The Athletic. A preliminary examination by a medical doctor on site left Magic officials hopeful that Wagner had not sustained a serious injury. Monday’s MRI revealed the high-ankle sprain.

The Magic have not revealed the severity of the high-ankle sprain, but the possibility has been raised that similar high-ankle sprains have taken two to four weeks to heal. But Orlando now has reasons for optimism. Former All-Star forward Paolo Banchero returned recently from a 10-game absence because of a groin strain. Guard Jalen Suggs has started to knock off the rust from his knee surgery late last season. Third-year guard Anthony Black has made strides. And shooting guard Desmond Bane, the team’s key offseason addition, started to look more comfortable on offense in the games before Banchero’s return. Moe Wagner, the Magic’s former sixth man who is recovering from an ACL tear from a year ago, continues to make progress in his recovery.

The Magic are in fifth place in the East at 14-10. Franz Wagner’s absence likely will hurt, perhaps enough to derail the Magic’s hopes of hosting a first-round playoff series. But the team appears to be better positioned to withstand a lengthy absence than it was a year ago, when Banchero and both Wagners missed extended stretches due to injuries.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/08151844/USATSI_27557171-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-09 11:09:13.533352

You're upset and you're hurt for your teammate, but you still understand that you have to go back out there and play.

You have to keep doing your job.

In those instances, you become more aware of your own responsibilities as well.

You have to stay precise on what you do because the backup quarterback is coming in, and you have to be ready and able to help him and support him in the best way possible so he can function well and execute the offense.

With a backup quarterback out there, you want to make it as easy as possible for him and you want to be exact in regard to what's been coached for him specifically. You need to be in the right spot at the right time and just be on the same page as the quarterback.

You have to be on your assignments, on your alignments and execution of the plays because you don't want him to have to think about anything other than his own assignment. You want to take as much off his plate as possible.

We saw that when the Colts supported Riley Leonard on Sunday when he came in after Daniel Jones sustained his season-ending Achilles injury. And we'll continue to see that kind of effort over the next four weeks, as Leonard or whoever else comes in at quarterback (Leonard is now dealing with a right knee injury, Shane Steichen said on Monday) prepares to play.

Simply put, you have to adjust what you do to what the quarterback does. He's going to have a lot on his plate; you're going to try to make it easier for him however you can. It's going to take extra practice time and extra meeting time to figure out what he likes, and how he operates. The plays that you run with one quarterback might be slightly different than the plays you run with another quarterback, because every quarterback has certain plays he excels at and certain plays he likes more than others.

You have to spend extra time with him to make sure you're on the same page, and making those adjustments and processing them isn't that hard. The difficulty comes in doing it quickly, like the Colts will have to do this week before their next game against the Seattle Seahawks.

It's being able to execute the plays and get the timing down with only a week to prepare – and only a few practices in that week – that's difficult.

And I understand that some of the fans' thoughts around the Colts' quarterback situation and the outlook for the next four weeks is that this team is probably not going to make the playoffs, based off Jones' injury and the way the team has played over the last few weeks.

As a player, though, you can't feel that way. As a player, you have to understand that you still have an opportunity to go out there and play your best every single week, and at the end of the day you hope you're on the winning side. You still have to go out there and support your teammates, play for your teammates and give it your all, because there is still a chance to reach your goals that you set at the beginning of the season.

There are still four games left in the season. Of course, the Colts need to concentrate on one game at a time, but they understand they still have a responsibility to do their best.

They understand that they owe it to the organization, their teammates and themselves to continue to go out there and play their best and take advantage of the opportunity they still have.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/bbbkfzedcnqpev6tasin,N,,2025-12-09 11:09:26.129600

The Colts aren't going to make the playoffs, Frank.

They're not, uh, and it's just that you use the term heartbreaking.

And that's what it is, not just for Daniel Jones but for the Colts as well.

To start, 7 and 1, and right now I, I don't, Look, maybe, Maybe Riley Leonard is Brock Purdy.

Uh, we don't know; we'll see, but I doubt it.

I hope he is too; it'd be awesome, but I doubt it.

Like, I, I, I assume the Colts lose out, and That just stinks.

Like it just stinks for how good they were, legitimately good.

Like that.

Nobody should be celebrating this, And there are so many ramifications here, Andrew, like, it's not just, Hey, the Colts are going to miss playoffs, then whatever.

The slate is kind of clean in 2026.

Daniel Jones is a free agent.

What do the Colts do?

Achilles injuries usually take a year to heal completely right.

Well, thats you know, he did this week 14.

Like, do you franchise him just thinking that, Well, youre gonna be there week 14?

Do you come up with a long-term deal?

For him, with some protections involved?

Because part of the reason they traded for Sauce Gardner said, we don't need those first round picks anymore.

We've got a quarterback.

We're good.

We're all in; we're fine.

Another ramification: those draft picks get better for the Jets.

Like, it's just part of the math, too.

Ramifications like the Forty-Niners face soon at the Colts in a couple of weeks.

That was, that looked like a losable game for the 49ers and other teams in the NFC wild card Race was probably like, OK, the Forty-Niners lose that game.

Nope, not anymore, probably, like, it changes the NFC playoff race.

It changes things for a team like the Jaguars, who won their game yesterday.

And they might have won anyway, who knows?

They won yesterday.

Against the Colts, they take over first place.

The path for the Texans is now clear.

What about, like, there is a reasonable, not crazy; I don't think it's going to happen, But a reasonable storyline where we're sitting here in a few weeks.

And I'm saying, remember the Daniel Jones injury?

Yeah, that knocked the Colts out, allowing the Chiefs to get the seventh seed.

Like something just like that.

There are so many butterfly effects.

So many butterfly effects involved with Daniel Jones's injury.

This absolutely alters the whole NFL season.

It really does.

And that's weird to say about a Colts team, that's not even going to make the playoffs.

But everything changed.

Everything changed, and it has ramifications.

Dickerson limped off the field without an injury timeout as the Eagles were driving against the Los Angeles Chargers. He was listed as questionable to return.

Dickerson returned at the end of the third quarter. Until then, Dickerson was replaced by Brett Toth.

It's the latest of several injuries that Dickerson has played through this season. He had knee surgery in August, but was back in time for the season-opener.

He missed a game earlier this season with an ankle injury. And he has also dealt with a quad injury in recent weeks.

The Eagles were already without right tackle Lane Johnson, who's missing his third straight game with a foot injury.

Dickerson was taken into the locker room just before the first half ended.

In addition, Chargers star safety Derwin James left the game a bit earlier to be evaluated for a concussion.

On Monday afternoon, after having his helmet strike the playing surface on multiple occasions during a Week 14 game against the Bills, the Bengals placed Higgins in the concussion protocol.

Early Monday evening, the NFL and the NFL Players Association issued a joint statement.

“Tee Higgins was evaluated twice in game and cleared to return,” the league and the union said. “After the game, in discussion with club medical personnel as part of a postgame evaluation, he notified the team he was experiencing symptoms and was immediately placed in the concussion protocol.”

It’s standard practice for players who are checked for concussions during games to be checked again after the game ends. And, yes, concussions sometimes don’t emerge immediately.

Still, the optics weren’t ideal. Higgins, who suffered the concussion when his helmet struck the artificial surface in Cincinnati, had it happen more than once on Sunday on the artificial turf in Buffalo. It became objectively uncomfortable to see it happen — and to see Higgins stay in the game

After the game, Higgins told reporters he had no concerns about continuing to play. The protocol is nevertheless in place to protect players from their natural inclination to keep playing.

Per a source with knowledge of the situation, there will be no investigation regarding the handling of Higgins, because there is no reason to believe the protocol may have been violated. This situation nevertheless creates a potential opportunity for tweaking the protocol when it comes to players returning from concussions.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ca9e7f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7481x4208+0+779/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F59%2Fa5%2F5f7838b141a39b4982699eac8fab%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D27767592,N,,2025-12-09 06:02:04.568479

Now 8-5 and without their starting quarterback, it's no longer a given the Colts make the postseason. Jones' replacement, the rookie Riley Leonard, isn't 100% healthy either.

According to ESPN, Leonard is dealing with a strained knee ligament that has him ""week to week."" The Colts are uncertain if he will be able to start on Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks. Coach Shane Steichen told reporters Monday that Leonard is dealing with a right knee injury, but that he will ""hopefully"" be available for Week 15. How Leonard fares in practice this week should determine whether he makes his first career start.

With Anthony Richardson still on injured reserve after fracturing his orbital bone, and Leonard nursing a banged-up knee, the only other quarterback the Colts have is Brett Rypien, who is on the practice squad. It's a reason why the Colts are bringing in 44-year-old Philip Rivers for a workout. Rivers was the last quarterback to lead the Colts to the playoffs, as he went 11-5 in his one season with Indy back in 2020.

As for Leonard, he completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards and one interception in his first extensive NFL action on Sunday, and also rushed for a touchdown. The sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame led the Fighting Irish to the College Football Playoff National Championship game last year, where they fell to the Ohio State Buckeyes.

NFL news is nonstop, and we're breaking it all down week by week this season.

Here's the latest on what's happening around the league entering Week 15:

Colts to work out Rivers with Jones, Leonard injured

On top of Daniel Jones tearing his Achilles, bringing an end to his season, the Indianapolis Colts are now also dealing with an injury to backup quarterback Riley Leonard, as coach Shane Steichen explained that he suffered a knee injury on Sunday.

In the wake of the two injuries, the Colts will look outside the organization for reinforcements, with the club set to bring in retired QB Philip Rivers for a Tuesday workout, per multiple reports. The 17-year veteran played his final NFL season with Indy in 2020, and the 44-year-old could soon find himself coming out of retirement and serving as the team's Week 15 starter if all goes well.

The 23-year-old Leonard was drafted in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL Draft by Indianapolis, and has appeared in two games this season. While the first time was in October and saw him make just two pass attempts, on Sunday against the Jaguars, he was 18-for-29 for 145 yards with no touchdowns and an interception while filling in for Jones.

Sunday was Leonard's most extensive action since Notre Dame lost last year's national championship game. Steichen couldn’t say yet if Leonard would play at Seattle, but the Colts have limited options in the building.

""He came in with a knee (injury) this morning so we’re working through that right now. That's what I've got right now,"" Steichen said before addressing Leonard's playing status. ""Hopefully, that’s the hope. We'll see how it goes.""

If Leonard can't play, veteran Brett Rypien could be next in line even though he was signed to the practice squad in mid-October but is not yet on the active roster. Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 overall draft pick in 2023, lost the quarterback competition to Jones in training camp and has not practiced since going on injured reserve with a fractured orbital bone in mid-October.

Indianapolis is 8-5 after losing three games in a row, and in second place in the AFC South.

Commanders' Ertz tears ACL

Commanders head coach Dan Quinn announced on Monday that tight end Zach Ertz will miss the rest of the season, per the Athletic. Ertz seemed to have torn his ACL on Sunday against the Vikings, and an MRI on Monday confirmed the injury.

Ertz, who was upended during an incomplete pass over the middle late in the third quarter thrown by backup Marcus Mariota after Jayden Daniels was sidelined by an aggravation of his elbow injury, left the Washington locker room on crutches.

Ertz was unable to put any weight on his leg as he was helped off the field and visibly upset as he reached the sideline, before being transported inside on a cart. The 13-year veteran, a second-round draft pick by Philadelphia who won a Super Bowl with the Eagles after the 2017 season, has 50 catches for 504 yards in 2025.

In his second season with the Commanders, Ertz has the second-most receptions by a tight end (825) in the NFL since his debut in 2013, trailing only Travis Kelce (1,063 entering Sunday). He recently passed Shannon Sharpe to move into fifth place all time in tight end receptions, behind Tony Gonzalez, Jason Witten, Kelce and Antonio Gates.

Browns name Sanders starting QB for rest of season

The Browns have named rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders their starter for the rest of the season, following Sunday's strong performance in a loss against the Titans. While Cleveland was defeated 31-29, Sanders threw for a career-high 364 yards.

Through his three starts, Sanders has shown improvement. He had a breakout game on Sunday, with three touchdowns and a rushing score. He joins Cincinnati’s Joe Burrow as the only rookie quarterbacks with at least 350 passing yards, three touchdown passes and one rushing score in a game.

Stefanski is also convinced that Sanders can learn from his mistakes, such as the ill-fated interception in the third quarter where he scrambled and threw a deep pass to the middle of the field where it was picked off by Tennessee's Xavier Woods. The interception would later lead to the Titans scoring the go-ahead touchdown.

""I think he has constantly and consistently gotten better in each one of these games and how he’s approached his game,"" Stefanski said. 'He’s been working very hard, so I feel good about where his development is heading. He knows there are always going to be plays that he can be better and those types of things, but he’s very intentional about getting better each and every game he’s out there.""

Bucs welcome back two-time Super Bowl champion pass rusher

A familiar face has returned to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers following the team's signing of defensive lineman Jason Pierre-Paul to the practice squad, per NFL Network. The Bucs signed Pierre-Paul, 36, after a workout, setting him up for a chance to help his former team's pass rush and playoff push with four games left in the regular season.

A 2010 first-round pick by the New York Giants, Pierre-Paul previously played for Tampa from 2018 to 2021, and was a member of the club's Super Bowl LV-winning defense in 2021. JPP has 94.5 sacks, 632 tackles and 21 forced fumbles in 180 career games, with his last action coming in 2023 when he played one game for the New Orleans Saints and two for the Miami Dolphins.

Higgins missed the Bengals' Week 13 victory against the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion, but returned on Sunday.

During the matchup in Buffalo, Higgins hit his head hard on the turf twice. He was evaluated for a head injury in both instances but returned to the game. On Monday, Bengals coach Zac Taylor revealed that Higgins was back in the protocol after reporting symptoms Sunday night and Monday morning.

""I'm just told if he's available or not,"" Taylor said. ""So I think what happened yesterday was -- obviously there's some (hits) that looked bad. Tee felt good throughout it, is what I've gained throughout the game and postgame obviously. He did this morning and last night have symptoms again. So we will put him back in the protocol.""

On Monday evening, the NFL and NFLPA released a joint statement detailing exactly what happened with Higgins, via CBS Sports NFL Insider Jonathan Jones:

""Tee Higgins was evaluated twice in game and cleared to return. After the game, in discussion with club medical personnel as part of a postgame evaluation, he notified the team he was experiencing symptoms and was immediately placed in the concussion protocol.""

The joint statement won't do anything to quell concerns regarding the NFL's concussion protocol. It was clear that a player coming off a concussion took two massive shots to the head, showed discomfort/pain, and was allowed to return to action.

Higgins was a major part of the Bengals' offense on Sunday despite the big hits, as he caught six passes for 92 yards and two touchdowns. He told reporters afterward that he didn't consider sitting out after hitting his head multiple times.

""I'm a team-first guy,"" Higgins said. ""My team needed me, you know I feel like they did, so I went out there and played and tried to dog this out with my team.""

With Higgins again in the concussion protocol, it's fair to say his status for Sunday's matchup against the Ravens is in doubt. According to SportsLine, the Bengals have a 3.1% chance to win the AFC North.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/08/6d247258-11ac-4a89-b840-a43a8ab230e1/thumbnail/1200x675/3482fe93d19ed72ea80805be4967e1a7/higgins.jpg,N,,2025-12-09 06:02:21.838877
