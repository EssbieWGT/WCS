Those types of injuries, you can't really do much,"" St. Brown said.
St. Brown hurt his ankle during the opening quarter of Detroit's 31-24 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving Day and didn't return.
His mindset is just he refuses to fail,"" Campbell said of St. Brown.
I'm thankful,"" St. Brown said.","DETROIT -- Unable to walk just last week because of an ankle injury, Lions receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown said he was willing to do ""whatever it takes to be out there"" against the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday night.

St. Brown, who was officially ruled active in the hours leading up to kickoff, finished with six receptions for 92 yards, including a crucial fourth-quarter catch that helped seal the Lions' 44-30 win against the Cowboys while keeping their playoff chances alive.

He said he didn't know until Wednesday whether he was going to play through his ankle sprain.

""No matter what our record was, whether we were undefeated right now or didn't have a win, I was going to do everything to be out there,"" St. Brown said. ""Just to be out there for my guys.

""I feel like availability is your best ability at the end of the day, so my job is to go out there and make plays and be on that field. It's what they pay me to do, so I was going to do whatever it takes to be out there.""

St. Brown didn't practice in the week leading up to Thursday night's pivotal game, which matched two teams battling for playoff contention with five games left in the season.

""I just rested it, honestly. Those types of injuries, you can't really do much,"" St. Brown said. ""You've got to rest it. I was in the training room a lot. The training did a great job doing all different types of modalities and things like that, but, yeah, [last] Friday after the game, I couldn't move.""

St. Brown hurt his ankle during the opening quarter of Detroit's 31-24 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving Day and didn't return. Initially, Lions coach Dan Campbell said he thought St. Brown could be out for a week or two, but the receiver progressed quicker than expected with the help of the team's training staff.

""He's rare, man. His mindset is just he refuses to fail,"" Campbell said of St. Brown. ""Nothing is going to dictate where he goes, what he does, how it's going to be. He will dictate to himself what he's going to do.""

After Thursday night's win, St. Brown exited the locker room with a commemorative game ball after establishing a new record for the most receptions (511) through five seasons in NFL history, a mark that previously belonged to Michael Thomas (510).

""I'm happy for this. I'm thankful,"" St. Brown said. ""Thankful to all the guys ... Jared [Goff], coaches, O-line, just everyone. I couldn't do it without them.""

Detroit's odds to make the playoffs improved from 43% to 56% with the win, according to ESPN Analytics. It remained in eighth place in the NFC.

The Lions have won 15 consecutive games following a loss, which is tied for the longest streak in NFL history, also done by 1984-88 Broncos and 2009-12 Ravens. They haven't lost consecutive games since a five-game losing streak in 2022.

""I think it is a kind of culmination of who we are. I don't think that happens on accident,"" said Goff, who went 25-for-34 with 309 passing yards and a touchdown. ""It's who we are, it's what we believe in.

""I think when those losses happen, they suck, but we do as good a job as any team of learning from that and coming back the next week and putting our head down.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1205%2Fr1585063_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-05 07:01:46.947269

Although these measures are often used as stand-ins for head injury exposure, they didn't help identify which players experienced worse mental or physical health later in life. The study suggests that future research and potentially future health guidelines in sports should rely on confirmed concussion history rather than assumptions based on position or years in the league.

ESPN was the first to report the news that Carter is having a procedure, not surgery, on both of his shoulders. It is an injury that has plagued Carter since the beginning of training camp.

An NFL source confirmed Carter's injury.

It's not known how long Carter will be out, but the report indicates that Carter won't be placed on injured reserve, meaning that the Eagles could get him back before the end of the regular season.

Still, Carter could miss more than one game.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

Carter missed the first three days of training camp in July because of the shoulder. He missed a game against the Giants on Oct. 9, but that was because of a heel injury.

For the most part, he was playing his usual allotment of about 85-95% of the defensive snaps.

That is, until the Eagles' most recent game, on Nov. 28 against the Bears. Carter only played 70% of the snaps in that game.

Carter did not have one of his better games as the Bears rushed for 281 yards, the most the Eagles had allowed in 10 years.

""There were some runs out there I got drove back and wasn’t able to have an effect on the play,"" Carter said after the game. ""We kind of made an adjustment, if you saw who was playing first and second down then third down, and we just went from there.""

Later, Carter said: ""It’s my problem to deal with. I won’t tell you what I’m going through.""

Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, however, admitted on Dec. 3 that Carter was dealing with a shoulder injury.

""He does have a shoulder issue,"" Fangio said. ""He has been playing with it. Late in the game, he had a great play with it, but it's definitely something there.""

Gibbs, Detroit’s prolific running back, recorded three touchdowns and had 43 yards on 12 carries. David Montgomery also tallied a touchdown and 60 yards rushing on six carries. Jared Goff was efficient, going 25-of-34 passing for 309 yards and a touchdown.

Meanwhile, the Cowboys offense struggled in the first half, mustering just nine points. Dak Prescott went 31-of-47 passing for 376 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions in the loss. CeeDee Lamb, who had six catches for 121 yards, left the game in the third quarter and was ruled out with a concussion.

The Lions improve to 8-5, keeping them in the hunt for a playoff spot in the NFC. The Cowboys fall to 6-6-1, decreasing their playoff odds significantly.

Check out our live coverage schedule for the week.

The Lions aren’t quite back in the NFC playoff field yet.

Detroit is now 8-5, one game behind the 9-4 49ers for the last NFC wild-card and No. 7 seed (San Francisco is on a bye this week).

The Lions will get some extra days off before a massive showdown against another NFC West playoff hopeful next week...

The playoff window is not closed, but it took a major hit Thursday night. A win would’ve pretty much allowed the Cowboys to control their playoff hopes. After this loss, their chances drop to 40 percent — if they win their remaining four games. This loss shouldn’t completely take away from what they’ve accomplished over the previous three games, beating the Chiefs and Eagles.

But it does show that there’s still a lot that needs to be cleaned up. Special teams was subpar, particularly in their kickoff coverage. The Detroit starting field position average was pretty much midfield. The run defense was the worst it has been since adding Quinnen Williams. Defensive help is obviously still needed, particularly on the back end. But there also wasn’t nearly enough pressure on Jared Goff. I do wonder how the game would have gone if CeeDee Lamb didn’t exit with the concussion.

If the Lions lost this game, their playoff hopes would’ve fallen from 30 percent to 12 percent. Dallas would’ve passed the Lions in the standings. The Lions are now 8-5 and the playoff push is very much alive. The Athletic’s playoff simulator gives the Lions a 45 percent chance at the moment. If the Lions can win three of their final four games, it should be enough to get them in. Easier said than done, and there’s still work to do, but this was a huge step in the right direction.

The Cowboys were heating up at the right time, winning three of their previous four games. Their offense was already among the best in the league. Their defense had tightened things up after some high-quality deadline additions. They looked like a dangerous team, while the Lions were limping into Week 14 — losing three of their previous five contests.

But there’s something about this team when pushed to the brink. They tend to hunker down and rise to the occasion. We haven’t seen it much this season, but we did tonight. This was a gutsy performance by the Lions, in a game they absolutely needed. The offense was brilliant, en route to a 44-point outing. The defense got home five times, and recorded three turnovers. It wasn’t always pretty, but they took care of business.

As Saad alludes to below, the numbers on The Athletic’s NFL Playoff simulator really aren’t in the Cowboys’ favor after tonight’s loss.

A win would have punctuated Dallas’ late-season surge by boosting the Cowboys’ playoff chances all the way up to 41 percent. The loss, however, tumbles them down to 9 percent. Another loss would essentially end what faint postseason hope the Cowboys still have, diminishing those odds down further to just 1 percent.

Tonight was a season-saver for the Lions. Don’t take my word for hit — ask The Athletic’s NFL Playoff Simulator.

Detroit entered tonight with just a 30 percent chance to return to the postseason. A loss to the Cowboys would have dimished those odds to just 12 percent. But the Lions’ win has boosted their playoff chances to 45 percent, nearly a coin flip. Detroit does have a tough schedule to close out the season, including games against the Rams, Steelers, Vikings and Bears.

Jahmyr Gibbs entered tonight’s game tied with Hall of Famer Randy Moss for the second-most touchdowns in NFL history before his 24th birthday (44). The only name ahead of Gibbs on that list? Another Hall of Famer, legendary Lions running back Barry Sanders — who, as he often is, was in attendance at Ford Field tonight.

And all Gibbs did in front of the Lions’ biggest icon was score three touchdowns to surge past Moss and tie Sanders for the record. Barring injury, he’s a good bet to break that mark very soon.

After suffering a sprained ankle one week ago on Thanksgiving, which made him a game-time decision tonight, Amon-Ra St. Brown showed no ill effects of that injury. St. Brown had 92 receiving yards on six catches, punctuated by two chunk plays — both massive catch-and-runs off intermediate slant or post routes.

One was a 26-yard catch-and-run in the first quart. The other was a 37-yard catch-and-run that effectively iced the game in the fourth quarter. Both set up Jahmyr Gibbs touchdowns, the first and last Lions scores of their 44-point night.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/09njoQZnCm6o_rqaxGCEBA0Kh_1440x960.png",N,,2025-12-05 02:58:33.321847

Trailing 27-9 in the third quarter, the Cowboys were driving and hoping to get back into the game. Dak Prescott lofted a pass up for CeeDee Lamb in the end zone, but the receiver wasn't able to brace his fall.

Lamb was down on the field for a few extra moments before getting up. He received some help from the trainers, bracing his left arm.

He also hit his head on the turf, which proved to be the injury that forced him out. After being checked out on the sidelines, Lamb headed off to the locker room, and was quickly ruled out after that.

Here's the latest on Lamb.

CeeDee Lamb injury update

Lamb has been ruled out with a concussion.

It initially appeared that Lamb was dealing with an arm injury, but it was his head hitting the turf that proved to be the problem.

He appeared to be favoring his left arm after falling in the end zone. Lamb remained down for a few moments, but did walk off the field with trainers holding his arm.

Lamb was evaluated by doctors for about three minutes before quickly being ruled out and taken to the locker room, per the Prime Video broadcast. It was a quick diagnosis from the Cowboys, who will be without Lamb for the remainder of the game.

What is concussion protocol in the NFL?

The NFL's concussion protocol is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury. It's a five-step process that a player has to clear before they can return to play. Those steps are, as defined by the NFL:

Symptom limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Full football activity/clearance

Before a player enters the protocol, they are evaluated on the sideline. The tests are conducted by the team's physician and unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant. The evaluation includes observing any ""no-go"" symptoms, which are things like loss of consciousness, confusion, amnesia and more, in addition to history of concussions, other signs/symptoms and video review.

At that point, a neurological exam is conducted and the player is escorted to the locker room if the sideline evaluation leaves any doubt.

Cowboys WR depth chart

Here's a look at the Cowboys WR depth chart for the remainder of Week 14 without Lamb:

CeeDee Lamb (injured)

George Pickens

Ryan Flournoy

KaVontae Turpin

Jonathan Mingo

Dallas has seen this movie before, losing Lamb to an ankle injury in Week 4. The star missed three contests with that injury, allowing Pickens to emerge as a big weapon in the team's passing attack.

Flournoy and Turpin have each been effective in their roles, while Mingo is playing in just his second game of the season in Week 14.

That's why Daniel Jones has consulted with a pair of his college teammates who have created a special 3D-printed pad to better protect his injured leg.

“I’m lucky to have smart friends,” Jones joked to reporters on Wednesday. “It’s pretty low-profile and fits to my leg pretty well. I don’t really notice it.”

Clark Bulleit, a former Duke center, and Kevin Gehsmann, an ex-linebacker for the Blue Devils, have helped Jones before in a similar situation. In 2018, they created a pad for Jones after he fractured his collarbone during a game against Northwestern.

Bulleit and Gehsmann majored in mechanical and biomedical engineering and now run Protect3D, a company that makes custom-printed 3D braces and orthotics. After Jones suffered the fracture in his lower leg last month, his former Duke teammates created a thin pad that goes under the left leg of his football pants. He's worn it in each of the past two weeks.

All Bulleit and Gehsmann needed to create the pad was a 60-second scan that led to a 90-minute design process. A day and a half later, the pad was delivered to Jones the night before the Colts’ 23-20 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.

“I think they had the idea before [the collarbone injury], but I was the first pad that they printed that was played with,” Jones said Wednesday. “They were starting up that business and had had the idea about it my last year at Duke.

“And since then, they’ve built a pretty good business, 3D printing those devices and pads. Kinda funny that I’m using one of them again, but they’re smart guys. I’m lucky to have smart friends.”

The Colts have five games remaining in the regular season, three of them against AFC South foes — two against the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Houston Texans in Week 18.

Tied with the Jaguars atop the division at 8-4 and just ahead of the 7-5 Texans, earning one of the AFC's top four seeds will be a tough assignment. Missing out on a division crown could result in missing the playoffs entirely.

Jones is having a bounce-back season and Jonathan Taylor has played his way into the NFL MVP conversation. The Colts need a healthy Jones in order to not waste what could be a breakthrough season after not having made the playoffs since 2020.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.sXom3Xe_N32eYWd.4S5xw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2025-12/356ba1b0-e45b-4343-8fca-d903126443d7,N,,2025-12-04 23:59:24.005460

They announced Wednesday that they've signed tight end Mark Andrews to a three-year extension, which is reportedly worth $39.3 million. Quarterback could be a bigger question mark, however, as Lamar Jackson missed yet another practice with an ankle injury on Thursday.

The Washington Commanders, meanwhile, could be in position to see their starting quarterback return on Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings, as Jayden Daniels was a full participant in Thursday's practice as he recovers from a gruesome elbow injury suffered in Week 9. Washington is hoping to end a seven-game losing streak dating back to Week 6.

Elsewhere, Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans returned to practice Wednesday after breaking his clavicle in October. Evans reportedly healed faster than expected and will have his 21-day practice window opened, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

The Cleveland Browns, meanwhile, are designating Deshaun Watson to return to practice. This designation opens Watson's 21-day window for the team to decide whether or not he's healthy enough to be activated. Since being traded to Cleveland from Houston, Watson has played in just 19 games, primarily due to an 11-game suspension handed down by the NFL following multiple sexual misconduct allegations and injuries.

The Kansas City Chiefs revealed some rough news Wednesday as left tackle Josh Simmons is going on injured reserve after having surgery on his left wrist, head coach Andy Reid told reporters. Simmons, whom the Chiefs selected in the first round of this year's draft, previously missed four games this season because of an undisclosed family matter.

Lamar Jackson has started five consecutive games for the Ravens since being knocked out three weeks by a hamstring injury. However, the 28-year-old quarterback has been dealing with nagging leg injuries in recent weeks, and he has missed practice as a result of them.

Jackson's practice routine changed ahead of Week 14, as he missed Thursday's session because of an ankle problem. Does that signal a change in his status moving forward?

Here's what to know about Jackson's latest missed practice session and where the team would turn if he can't play in Week 14.

Will Lamar Jackson play Week 14?

Jackson's status for the Ravens' Week 14 game against the Steelers remains unclear. He was a limited participant in practice before being downgraded to a non-participant in Thursday's session, per multiple reports, casting doubt about his ability to suit up for the rivalry contest.

It's worth noting that Jackson has missed at least one practice session per week dating back to Week 11. Each time, he has been listed on Baltimore's practice report with a knee or ankle problem but has not carried any injury designation into game day.

That said, Jackson's absences from practice have typically come during the team's first session of the week. He missed the Ravens' Wednesday practices in Weeks 11 and 12 before being a full participant at the Thursday and Friday sessions. The two-time MVP followed a similar pattern ahead of Baltimore's Thanksgiving game against the Cincinnati Bengals, earning a non-participation tag Monday before returning fully Tuesday and Wednesday.

So, at the very least, the change in Jackson's practice pattern is notable. It will also make his status at Friday's practice worth watching, as what he's able to accomplish will be the best barometer of whether he will be able to play Week 14 against the Steelers.

Who is the Ravens' backup quarterback?

Tyler Huntley is the Ravens' backup quarterback and would get the nod if Jackson isn't able to play in Week 14.

Huntley, 27, won his lone start of the 2025 NFL season, which came in Week 8 against the Chicago Bears. He has completed 27 of 37 passes (73%) for 254 yards and a touchdown across two appearances while adding 92 rushing yards on 11 carries.

Huntley has posted a career record of 6-9 across 15 starts while completing 65.2% of his passes for 3,040 yards, 12 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. The 27-year-old – nicknamed ""Snoop"" – spent the 2025 NFL preseason with the Cleveland Browns before rejoining the Ravens for his third stint since signing in Baltimore as an undrafted free agent in 2020.

Ravens QB depth chart

The Ravens have three quarterbacks on their 53-man roster. Below is the pecking order within the unit:

Lamar Jackson

Tyler Huntley

Cooper Rush

The Ravens signed Rush to a two-year, $6.2 million contract during the 2025 NFL offseason to back up Jackson. The longtime Dallas Cowboys backup started two games in place of Jackson after the star quarterback's hamstring injury and struggled, completing 65.4% of his passes for 303 yards, no touchdowns and four interceptions.

Rush's struggles allowed Huntley to leapfrog him for the backup role. The 32-year-old has a 9-7 career record and has completed 61.1% of his career passes for 3,766 yards, 20 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/04/USAT/87607623007-lamar-jackson-ravens-120425.jpg?crop=5104,2873,x0,y56&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-04 20:01:43.377307

The Lions (7-5, 3rd in NFC North) are taking on the Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1, 2nd in NFC East) on Thursday, Dec. 4, at Ford Field in Detroit with big NFC playoff implications potentially on the line. The Lions have had a tough week with center Frank Ragnow's re-retirement and cornerback Terrion Arnold's addition to the injured reserve list, and major questions about whether the Lions will make the playoffs (they're currently out).

St. Brown, who didn't practice this week as he recovered from an ankle injury suffered in the Lions' 31-24 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving Day, is ready to play after a good pregame workout.

However, the Lions will be without starting left guard Kayode Awosika, who was downgraded from questionable to out hours before kickoff.

With the Lions likely needing to win at least four of their last five games to make the playoffs, they probably can't afford many more injuries if they want to see the postseason, much less make a run toward Super Bowl 60.

We'll have all the live injury updates from the Lions-Cowboys game below.

Lions vs Cowboys live injury updates

This section will be updated after kickoff.

Cowboys inactives

The Cowboys listed six players on their inactives list, most notably defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, who has four sacks over nine games so far in 2025.

Lions inactives

The Lions have six players listed on the inactive list, including safety Kerby Joseph and offensive lineman Kayode Awosika. It's unclear who will start in Awosika's place, though offensive lineman Trystan Colon could be an option now that starting center Graham Glasgow will be returning.

As previously reported, Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown is active and expected to play.

""He is Lamar Jackson.","OWINGS MILLS, Md. -- Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken said Thursday that he expects quarterback Lamar Jackson to play against the Pittsburgh Steelers despite the two-time NFL Most Valuable Player missing practice with an ankle injury.

""I just give him a lot of credit - he's battling each week trying to get healthy enough to be able to play every Sunday,"" Monken said. ""I mean, that's what I see out of him. I see a guy that's battling little nagging injuries, things that are stopping him from being able to get out there every day and practice.""

Jackson was limited on Wednesday and then didn't participate Thursday, which is three days from the Ravens' battle with the Steelers for first place in the AFC North.

This marks the fourth straight week where Jackson has been sidelined for at least one practice. During that stretch, Jackson has been mired in a career-worst worst slump by going three straight games without producing a touchdown.

In Jackson's last game - a 32-14 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on Thanksgiving night - Jackson committed a season-high three turnovers and completed a season-low 53.1% of his passes (17-of-32).

Monken said it's ""hard to judge"" how much the missed practice time has impacted Jackson's recent performances. This season, Jackson has dealt with a growing list of injuries: hamstring, knee, toe and ankle.

Ravens tight end Mark Andrews indicated he's there for Jackson during his struggles but added that Jackson doesn't really need anyone's support.

Two of the Eagles' All-Pro linemen did not participate in Thursday's practice ahead of the Monday night showdown with the Los Angeles Chargers.

Defensive tackle Jalen Carter was sidelined with injuries to both shoulders. Defensive Coordinator Vic Fangio noted that Carter was dealing with the injury during his Wednesday press conference.

""He does have a shoulder issue. He has been playing with it. Late in the game (against the Bears), he had a great play with it, but it's definitely something there,"" Fangio said.

Fangio added that rookie defensive tackle Ty Robinson may factor more into the line rotation due to Carter's injury. The third-round pick has been on the field for 35 defensive snaps this year.

Offensive tackle Lane Johnson was the only other Eagle to miss practice on Thursday. He has missed the past two games with a foot injury. Fred Johnson started in Johnson's absence.

Safety Marcus Epps returned to practice for the first time since being placed on Injured Reserve with a shoulder ailment on November 1. The seventh-year veteran played in eight games this season, but was previously a starter for the Eagles in his first tenure with the team. From 2020-23, Epps started in 28 games, including playoffs. Epps would need to be activated off Injured Reserve by Monday at 4 PM in order to be eligible to play against the Chargers. The Eagles elevated Andre' Sam from the practice squad last week with safety Andrew Mukuba going on Injured Reserve.

Wide receiver/punt returner Xavier Gipson returned to practice in a limited capacity for the first time since suffering a shoulder injury against the Cowboys on November 23.

What's the latest on Justin Herbert?

Quarterback Justin Herbert was limited in practice on Thursday as he recovers from surgery to stabilize a fracture in his left (non-throwing) hand that took place on Monday. Herbert suffered the injury during the first quarter of Sunday's win over the Raiders. He exited the game for eight plays, but returned after the hand was placed in a cast with a glove over it. The Chargers protected Herbert by only running plays for him out of the shotgun and pistol formations.

Trey Lance replaced Herbert for the brief period on Sunday. He is taking the first-team reps in Herbert's absence.

Despite the limited designation on Thursday, the Chargers have expressed optimism that Herbert will play Monday night against the Eagles.

""Yeah, that's the plan. To prepare as if I'm going to play,"" Herbert said on Wednesday, according to Chargers.com. Head Coach Jim Harbaugh and Offensive Coordinator Greg Roman have expressed similar sentiments in press conferences this week.

It remains to be seen whether rookie first-round pick Omarion Hampton will return to action against the Eagles. Hampton was a limited participant on Thursday. Reports indicate he was wearing a non-contact jersey at practice. Hampton was placed on Injured Reserve on October 8 after fracturing his left ankle against the Washington Commanders. His 21-day practice window opened on November 25. Hampton has 314 rushing yards and two touchdowns, averaging 4.8 yards per carry, this season. He also has 20 catches for 136 yards through the air.

Wide receiver Quentin Johnston was limited with a shoulder injury. He was seen at practice with a non-contact jersey. He leads the Chargers with seven touchdown receptions this season.

Pivotal night for the NFC

Barring a tie, the result of “Thursday Night Football” will drastically shape the remainder of 2025 for both teams.

If Detroit wins: Its playoff odds jump to 46 percent, while the Cowboys’ chances fall to 9 percent, all but eliminating them.

If Dallas wins: Its odds bump up to 41 percent, and the Lions drop to a nearly elimination-level 13 percent.

Campbell’s Lions are three-point home favorites in the game beginning at 8:15 p.m. ET on Prime Video. Here’s what I’m watching for:

Detroit’s high-powered offense, sans stars. Tight end Sam LaPorta is on the IR, while star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle) missed every practice this week and likely sits. Expect the Lions to lean heavily on Jahmyr Gibbs and Jameson Williams while rookie receiver Isaac TeSlaa gets more looks.

Dallas’ passing offense. The Cowboys’ passer rating is below average against Cover 1 defenses, and the Lions lean heavily on that physical, press-heavy style due to their talented secondary, which has allowed the fewest yards of separation in the NFL. But George Pickens doesn’t need separation, and should be peppered with targets tonight.

The Lions defensive line. Detroit must get more from this group. As our Lions beat writer Colton Pouncy explained, Detroit has the slowest time to pressure in the NFL and is allowing the fifth-highest explosive pass rate for opposing quarterbacks when under pressure. Prescott has led the league in yards per dropback when pressured.

The Cowboys’ improved run defense. Defensive tackle Quinnen Williams has transformed everything. Allowing 1.83 yards before contact (29th) from Weeks 1 to 9, this group now allows a league-best 0.32, having successfully limited Saquon Barkley (2.2 yards per carry) and Ashton Jeanty (1.2). The interior of Detroit’s offensive line is its weakest link, and that’s where Dallas is strongest.

Winners of three straight, the Cowboys have the momentum and maybe the talent edge, given Detroit is also missing All-Pro safety Kerby Joseph. I’ll take Dallas by six. Let the upsets continue.

For more, my colleagues Jon Machota and Colton Pouncy, who cover these two teams, shared an insightful game preview here. Over to Dianna for a word on 2026 coaching candidates.

What Dianna’s Hearing: Few standouts so far

Last January, Ben Johnson and Mike Vrabel were at the top of every team’s head-coaching wishlist. Through 13 weeks, it’s easy to see why. Johnson and Vrabel have the Bears and Patriots atop their respective conferences in December.

So who could be the 2026 hot-shot candidate? We’re still waiting for that name to emerge.

I would expect Kansas City offensive coordinator (and former Bears head coach) Matt Nagy to garner interest.

Same for veteran defensive coordinators Lou Anarumo (Colts) and Robert Saleh (49ers).

Younger defensive names, including the Jaguars’ Anthony Campanile and the Rams’ Chris Shula, could generate buzz as well.

I’ll be interested to see if the Giants make a call to Washington, looking into whether Kliff Kingsbury wants to work with a different young NFC East quarterback: Jaxson Dart.

From what I can gather, at this point in the cycle, no candidate has separated themselves from the pack quite yet. Back to you, Jacob.

Burrow and Herbert: Tough as they come

Andrew Luck felt invincible, until he wasn’t. His shocking retirement came at age 29, after six seasons, 86 regular-season games and 174 sacks, with a swath of punishing injuries to show for it.

Could Joe Burrow and Justin Herbert relate?

The 28-year-old Burrow has taken 28 more sacks than Luck in 14 fewer games, and he’s had at least four significant injuries across six seasons, ranging from a shredded knee as a rookie to a significant turf-toe injury this year.

In six seasons with the Chargers, the (somehow still only) 27-year-old Herbert’s taken seven more sacks than Burrow, albeit in more games. Among other injuries, Herbert’s broken his collarbone, fractured a rib, broken some fingers and, just last week, broken a bone in the back of his non-throwing hand.

Yet Herbert’s only missed four games in his career (Burrow’s missed 23, though that isn’t meant to imply he should’ve played without, you know, a knee), and threw a touchdown right after the latest break. As my colleague Daniel Popper wrote in his story on how Herbert plans to play on Monday, just days after ongoing surgery to stabilize the fracture, the Chargers quarterback is a fighter.

💬 “He fractured his rib cartilage in Week 2 of 2022 and played the next week. He suffered a high ankle sprain in Week 2 of last year and played the next week. Herbert broke his left middle finger in Week 4 of 2023 and did not miss a game.”

As for Burrow, how back is he? The 4-8 Bengals’ franchise quarterback made an emotional return on Thanksgiving, winning despite completing just 52.2 percent of his passes. In Derrik Klassen’s Quick Outs column, he explains that the league’s second-highest-paid player was rusty, for sure, but was better than that completion percentage suggests.

💬 “Truthfully, I was worried that Burrow had rushed back and wouldn’t look stable in the pocket right away. That couldn’t have been further from the truth. Burrow far outplayed his simple counting stats. Maybe it’s too little, too late for that version of him to turn the Bengals’ season around, but it’s nice to see him play at that level nonetheless.”

Tomorrow, we’ll preview the weekend’s biggest games. For more on that, Austin Mock shares six games that could shape the 2025 postseason, all occurring this week.

McCarthy cleared concussion protocol Thursday, his final step in returning to the starting lineup in time for Sunday's game against the Washington Commanders.

McCarthy suffered the concussion during a 23-6 loss in Week 12 to the Green Bay Packers and missed last week's 26-0 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Speaking Thursday with local reporters, he said he couldn't specify a play that caused the injury.

""Every single game kind of feels like you get kicked in the face by a donkey,"" McCarthy said amid a season in which he has missed as many games (six) because of injuries as he has played.

The Vikings hope McCarthy can remain in the lineup for their final five regular-season games as they look ahead to 2026 roster decisions. Coach Kevin O'Connell said this week that he has abandoned his seasonlong focus on McCarthy's mechanics and instead wants him to concentrate on decision-making and avoiding the kind of open-field contact that caused his two major injuries this year -- a high right ankle sprain in Week 2 and the concussion.

""There will be time to fundamentally focus on things and continue building this layer and a foundation that will be important for him into the future,"" O'Connell said. ""But now it feels like he's got enough experience. He knows a lot of these principles that we've talked about. I want him to have a clear head and a clear mind to just go play, but play with an understanding of the decisions that I make with the ball in my hand, the decisions that I make as a passer, and as we've learned, very important as a runner to protect himself and make sure that we can keep him in there.""

McCarthy said Thursday that he's a ""natural overthinker."" While making clear that he does not blame the coaching staff for pushing him hard on mechanics and footwork during the season, he said his concern about it falls ""into the bucket"" of overthinking.

""Just worrying about things,"" he said of how the focus on mechanics might have affected him. ""Like on the 12th hole, you're not going to switch up your golf swing and stuff like that. But there's always ways to refine it. There's always little mental cues that you're going to take throughout that game.

Carter will continue to undergo treatment on his shoulders and hopes to be as close to 100% as possible for the playoffs. Philadelphia (8-4) has a 1.5 game lead over the Dallas Cowboys for first place in the AFC East with five games remaining in the regular season.

This season hasn't been as productive for Carter, though. In 10 games, Carter tallied 2.0 sacks and four tackles for loss. He has, however, batted down six passes which ties his single-season high that was set last year.

On top of the thumbs-up list is left tackle Dion Dawkins who was listed as a limited participant in Wednesday’s practice. Sure, it was a walkthrough, but he wasn’t far enough along in the NFL’s concussion protocol to even do that much last week. Technically, the nine-year veteran could be a full participant on Thursday if he’s still symptom free. Dawkins could also stay limited all week, go through a simulated practice on Saturday, and be cleared to play. No matter how it goes, Dawkins participating on Wednesday is a very good sign.

Right tackle Spencer Brown’s shoulder injury had him inactive all of last week. Like Dawkins, he’s now progressed to limited work. It’s a good sign that he won’t miss too much time, but I would be a little more cautious on assuming he will play Sunday. It would be nice to think that some light work this week coupled with a harness at game time would have him good to go — but if he’s not 100%, having Alec Anderson for a second week in there is a more-than-adequate option.

Other good news for Buffalo is that tight end Dalton Kincaid was listed as a limited participant on Wednesday. The tight end has missed the past three weeks after suffering a hamstring injury in the Bills’ loss to the Miami Dolphins in Week 10. However, the positivity surrounding Kincaid’s practice participation should be hampered a little by the fact that Buffalo are now listing him with two injuries. He’s now being treated for a knee injury as well as the hamstring issues.

Not practicing for the Bills were Joey Bosa, Joshua Palmer, and Terrel Bernard. Bernard continues to deal with the elbow injury he suffered in Week 12. It would be great to see him back, but veteran linebacker Shaq Thompson is doing just fine in the MIKE position, so Buffalo taking their time with the fourth-year linebacker is warranted.

Both Bosa and Palmer have had injuries, but now each have additional ones. Palmer suffered his knee and ankle injury in Week 6 when the Bills played in Atlanta. After missing three games, Palmer was back on the field for Week 11. However, after two games, he was back out with an ankle injury again this Sunday. Now, once again, he’s listed as dealing with both the knee and ankle injury. Don’t be surprised if you see the Bills shut him down with a trip to Injured Reserve soon. Reading the tea leaves from head coach Sean McDermott don’t sound as promising as one might hope:

Bosa has had a wrist injury, and he’s played with a club-style cast/wrap for weeks. But on Sunday, while pursuing Steelers’ quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Bosa suffered a hamstring injury. When asked before practice on Wednesday, McDermott said that he would consider Bosa as week-to-week. McDermott went on to clarify that there’s “two ways” of viewing that: either 1-2 weeks, or 3-4 weeks. McDermott said he’s hoping for the former. In Bills coach speak: Don’t expect to see Bosa chasing quarterbacks Joe Burrow this weekend or Drake Maye in Week 15.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are finally seeing encouraging news on the injury front as the season reaches its critical stages. Star wideout Mike Evans and rookie receiver Jalen McMillan are making steady progress toward returning, giving the offense a much-needed boost. Their eventual comeback could be a game-changer as Tampa Bay battles for divisional relevance. With both receivers sidelined for extended periods, the Buccaneers have had to adjust their passing game and offensive schemes. The team is optimistic that the return of Evans and McMillan will strengthen Baker Mayfield’s options and add new dimensions to Tampa Bay’s attack.

Buccaneers monitor progress as Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan work toward full return

Head coach Todd Bowles confirmed that Evans and McMillan participated in Wednesday’s walkthrough, with Thursday’s practice expected to provide more clarity on their readiness. While a Week 14 return remains unlikely, their involvement in team activities signals meaningful progress and a potential impact in the coming weeks.

Baker Mayfield on Mike Evans & Jalen McMillan Returning | Press Conference | Tampa Bay Buccaneers

For Baker Mayfield, seeing Evans and McMillan back on the practice field was an exciting sight. “Mike just attracts so much attention,” Mayfield said. “His playmaking ability is great to have. I can trust him, know where he's going to be. It really affects how a defense is going to play you. For J-Mac, it’s obviously been a long time coming… he’s worked his tail off to get to this point.” Their progress, even in limited practice, is a morale boost for the quarterback and the entire team. Evans remains one of Mayfield’s most dependable targets, known for creating separation and drawing constant defensive attention, while McMillan brings a fresh, explosive element once fully cleared. Tampa Bay is taking a cautious approach to their ramp-up, ensuring both receivers regain timing, conditioning, and confidence before stepping back onto the field. Their return could rejuvenate the offense and open up new opportunities for Baker Mayfield to make big plays. Even a partial return of these key players could significantly boost the Buccaneers’ offense. While immediate impact may be limited, the team’s outlook is brighter, and Baker Mayfield now has reason to be excited about the near-future additions to his lineup. Their return also gives Tampa Bay fans hope for a stronger finish to the season.

Amon-Ra St. Brown injury update The Lions have not yet made a decision about St. Brown's status for ""Thursday Night Football.""","The Detroit Lions' season of injuries continues to mount up.

The Lions are set to be without multiple key contributors when they host the Dallas Cowboys (6-5-1) on ""Thursday Night Football"" on Thursday, Dec. 4. The question remaining is whether star wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown will be among them.

St. Brown exited Detroit's Thanksgiving Day game against the Green Bay Packers after suffering an ankle injury when a lineman rolled on his leg from behind. His availability has been in doubt since.

Detroit enters Week 14 with a 7-5 record – eighth-best in the NFC – leaving them on the outside looking in to the playoff picture. They are battling to stay in the race and Lions fans are hopeful their All-Pro wide receiver will be available today.

Here's the latest on St. Brown before ""Thursday Night Football"" kickoff against the Cowboys.

Amon-Ra St. Brown injury update

The Lions have not yet made a decision about St. Brown's status for ""Thursday Night Football."" Detroit listed him as ""questionable"" on its final injury report and is expected to make a game-time decision about his status.

St. Brown has only before missed two games during his five-year NFL career to date. The last one he missed was in 2023 when he suffered an abdominal injury in Week 3. He played through it before missing Week 5 due to the injury. Prior to that, he suffered an identical injury to this ankle sprain in Week 3 of 2022, which saw him miss Week 4.

St. Brown failed to participate in practice this week, but the Lions have no plans to place him on IR, which would require that he be out for at least four weeks. He was initially classified as ""week-to-week"" after suffering the low ankle sprain, per NFL Media's Tom Pelissero.

Pelissero also noted the Lions will have a mini-bye because of the ""Thursday Night Football"" matchup, which allows St. Brown extra time to recover if he can't play against the Cowboys.

Detroit has been no stranger to playing without its stars on offense, with TE Sam LaPorta lost for the season.

Lions WR depth chart

The Lions have six receivers on their 53-man roster:

Amon-Ra St. Brown (injured)

Jameson Williams

Kalif Raymond

Isaac TeSlaa

Tom Kennedy

Dominic Lovett

Kalif Raymond and TE Brock Wright missed last week's game, but they may be active for Thursday's matchup against Dallas. Isaac TeSlaa and Tom Kennedy operated as the No. 2 and 3 WRs behind Jameson Williams after St. Brown exited on Thanksgiving.

Williams will be Jared Goff's top target if St. Brown is sidelined. The 2022 first-round pick went off for 144 yards and a touchdown on seven receptions and a team-high 10 targets on Thanksgiving.

TeSlaa, a rookie third-round pick this season, could be more involved. His size at 6-4, 214 pounds makes him a legitimate red-zone threat.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/03/USAT/87577186007-usatsi-27484512.jpg?crop=8185,4607,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-04 14:03:03.555500

While a calf strain will keep him sidelined for weeks, it is a preferable injury and timeline to what players first imagined when they saw Antetokounmpo go down with no one else around him.
While Antetokounmpo was able to avoid a serious injury, the Bucks will still be in a challenging position with their star forward on the sidelines.
The injury, though, comes at an opportune time for the Bucks, regarding the number of games Antetokounmpo might end up missing.
The schedule is demanding after those two weeks, with the Bucks playing nine of their 11 games on the road between Dec. 21 and Jan. 11.","Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo will be sidelined for two to four weeks with a right calf strain he suffered Wednesday night, a league source confirmed to The Athletic.

ESPN first reported the news.

Antetokounmpo suffered a calf strain in what appeared to be a non-contact injury three minutes into Milwaukee’s 113-109 comeback win against the Detroit Pistons, which pushed the Bucks to 10-13 on the season. While a calf strain will keep him sidelined for weeks, it is a preferable injury and timeline to what players first imagined when they saw Antetokounmpo go down with no one else around him.

“It’s tough. Our brains always assume the worst right away,” Bucks guard AJ Green said after the game. “You hope it’s never that, but he’ll be all right. I’m not sure exactly what it is, but he’ll be all right.”

Following the game, Bucks coach Doc Rivers told the media that the team had ruled out an Achilles injury before Antetokounmpo underwent the MRI, and that early diagnosis was confirmed Thursday. While Antetokounmpo was able to avoid a serious injury, the Bucks will still be in a challenging position with their star forward on the sidelines.

Despite pulling off a surprising comeback win on Wednesday over the Eastern Conference’s best team without Antetokounmpo, the Bucks are 1-6 this season with their nine-time All-NBA forward not playing, including losing all four games he missed in November with a left adductor strain.

Milwaukee’s struggles this season have once again embroiled the team in trade rumors following an ESPN report on Wednesday about the conversations the star and his representation have had with the organization in light of the team’s underwhelming start.

While team sources downplayed those conversations, they acknowledged frustration throughout the organization over the team’s struggles in the first month and a half of the season.

Before Wednesday’s game, Rivers took a forceful tone with the media when discussing the reporting and even attacked ESPN’s coverage of Antetokounmpo.

“For the 50th time — and clearly it’s not getting to one network, for sure — Giannis has never asked to be traded. Ever,” Rivers said. “I can’t make that more clear.”

Yet, Rivers conceded that he understood why the future of the franchise’s all-time leading scorer was once again the topic of conversation around the league.

“The reason that this is out is because we’re not playing well,” Rivers said before Wednesday’s game. “So, let’s just call a spade a spade. We’re not playing well. We had a tough loss the other night, and so now this is the subject matter.

“We feel very good about this team, but we have to play better. We have to win games. And until we start winning games, this is going to be out here. We rip off 10 in a row, (and) my guess is this is magically going to disappear.”

While Rivers’ proposed plan might have worked with Antetokounmpo producing at an MVP level, it will be far more difficult for the team to win games consistently with him sidelined. It might leave the Bucks in a precarious position in the standings when their star returns to the floor.

The injury, though, comes at an opportune time for the Bucks, regarding the number of games Antetokounmpo might end up missing.

After playing 16 games in November, the Bucks play 13 games in December. Since the Bucks did not qualify for the NBA Cup quarterfinals, they will play only five games between Dec. 4 and Dec. 18, two weeks from Thursday’s diagnosis. The schedule is demanding after those two weeks, with the Bucks playing nine of their 11 games on the road between Dec. 21 and Jan. 11.

With Kevin Porter Jr.’s return from injury, Milwaukee can pair him with NBA Most Improved Player candidate Ryan Rollins and have a much better chance of winning games without their star on the floor.

However, the road ahead will be difficult, and Milwaukee will need to show its resolve to keep its postseason chances alive while Antetokounmpo is sidelined with his right calf strain.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/04121209/Gianniscalf-scaled-e1764877155214.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-04 17:05:16.809913

Understanding the players who are injured and at risk of missing Week 14 could be the difference between securing a playoff spot and playing for pride in the consolation bracket. Be sure to check in with this article throughout the week, as it will be updated with the players who are being upgraded and downgraded in practice ahead of Week 14.

Lamar Jackson, QB, Baltimore Ravens

Lamar Jackson was listed as a limited participant at the Baltimore Ravens’ Wednesday practice due to an ankle injury. This is an upgrade for Jackson, who has missed the first practice of the week in recent weeks due to various injuries.

Unfortunately, Jackson was downgraded to a non-participant on Thursday. That is far from ideal for the veteran quarterback and puts his status in Week 14 in jeopardy. Tyler Huntley would be the starter if Jackson is held out.

Justin Herbert, QB, Los Angeles Chargers

Justin Herbert suffered a hand injury during the Los Angeles Chargers’ win over the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 13 that required surgery. Herbert had that procedure on Monday and is considered day-to-day. The initial belief is that the veteran quarterback has a chance to be ready for Week 14’s matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles, especially since the game is on Monday night.

Expect Herbert to be ramped up as the week progresses to see if his hand can handle the rigors of catching snaps. If Herbert is ruled out, journeyman quarterback Trey Lance would be the starter.

Jayden Daniels, QB, Washington Commanders

Jayden Daniels began to practice last week before ultimately being ruled out for the Washington Commanders’ Week 13 matchup against the Denver Broncos. The quarterback has made it clear in interviews that when he is ready to return to the field, he wants to, regardless of the team’s record.

Head coach Dan Quinn stated that Daniels had not been fully cleared for contact heading into Week 14, but that the team would continue to ramp him up before deciding his game status on Friday. Marcus Mariota would continue to start if Daniels is ultimately unable to return.

Kyler Murray, QB, Arizona Cardinals | Out

Kyler Murray is eligible to return from the injured reserve in Week 14. However, Arizona Cardinals’ head coach Jonathan Gannon told reporters during his Monday press conference that Murray was “… not quite there yet.”

Jacoby Brissett will remain the starter in Arizona for the foreseeable future. Given how well the offense has looked with Brissett under center, it is fair to question whether the Cardinals will activate Murray at all in 2025, especially in a lost season.

J.J. McCarthy, QB, Minnesota Vikings

J.J. McCarthy missed the Minnesota Vikings’ matchup against the Seattle Seahawks due to a concussion. McCarthy has yet to clear the concussion protocol officially, but the fact that he was practicing in a limited fashion last week suggests that he will clear it in short order.

If McCarthy clears the protocol, he will be the starter against the Washington Commanders in Week 14. He logged a full practice on Wednesday, putting him on track to return.

Sam Darnold, QB, Seattle Seahawks

Sam Darnold was briefly taken into the medical tent during the Seattle Seahawks’ Week 13 win over the Minnesota Vikings due to an ankle injury. Darnold returned to the game and finished without issue. There is no reason to believe he will miss Week 14, but he will likely appear on the injury report throughout the week.

Omarion Hampton, RB, Los Angeles Chargers

The Los Angeles Chargers opened Omarion Hampton’s 21-day practice window to return from the injured reserve before Week 13’s matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders. The team ultimately chose not to activate him from the injured reserve after a week of practice.

Reports indicate that Hampton should return in Week 14. He is likely to return to a split backfield situation with second-year runner Kimani Vidal. Hampton was averaging 15.4 fantasy points per game before his injury, so fantasy managers should be excited to play him regardless of the pending backfield split.

Aaron Jones Sr., RB, Minnesota Vikings

Aaron Jones Sr. has been navigating a shoulder injury for several weeks. The Minnesota Vikings running back aggravated his shoulder during the third quarter of the team’s loss to the Seattle Seahawks and did not return to the game. He is considered day-to-day with the injury and logged a limited practice on Wednesday.

If the Vikings choose to rest the veteran running back to allow him to heal, then Jordan Mason would take on the bulk of the backfield, with Zavier Scott absorbing some work in the pass game.

Alvin Kamara, RB, New Orleans Saints

Veteran running back Alvin Kamara suffered a sprained MCL in the New Orleans Saints’ Week 12 loss to the Atlanta Falcons. MCL sprains are usually multi-week issues, so it wasn’t surprising when Kamara missed Week 13’s game against the Miami Dolphins.

Kamra does have a chance to return in Week 14 (although he may be limited) in a difficult matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He did not practice on Wednesday, setting the stage for a second missed contest.

If the veteran running back misses the game, then rookie Devin Neal would continue to dominate touches out of the backfield. Neal had just 9.9 PPR points in the Saints’ loss to the Dolphins, but posted 14 carries for 47 yards and three receptions for 22 yards while playing 81% of the team’s offensive snaps.

Tyrone Tracy Jr., RB, New York Giants

There was initial concern that Tyrone Tracy Jr. had suffered a significant lower-body injury after he was carted off the field during the fourth quarter of the New York Giants’ loss to the New England Patriots. However, Tracy spoke with reporters on Tuesday and told them he had suffered a stinger in his hip and should be fine.

The Giants are on bye in Week 14, so Tracy can’t help fantasy managers in the short term. However, if a fantasy manager panics and drops him due to the injury and bye week, he is worth stashing, since it does not seem he will miss time.

Woody Marks, RB, Houston Texans

Woody Marks briefly left the Houston Texans’ win over the Indianapolis Colts in Week 13 with an ankle injury. He was able to return and finish the game. The rookie was listed as a non-participant in Wednesday’s practice due to the same ankle injury.

This was likely a rest day for Marks, so there is no reason for concern at this time. He was able to return to practice on Thursday, which means he is trending toward playing in Week 14.

Trey Benson, RB, Arizona Cardinals

There was hope that Trey Benson could return to the field for the Arizona Cardinals in Week 13 after the team had opened his 21-day return window from the injured reserve in Week 12. Unfortunately, Benson logged a limited practice on Wednesday before being downgraded to a non-participant on Thursday and Friday, and then ruled out.

Benson has until Dec. 10 to be activated from the injured reserve, or he will need to be shut down for the remainder of the season. In theory, that gives him one more week to ramp up and return.

The second-year running back was not spotted at the open media portion of practice on Wednesday and did not practice on Thursday, which is not a good sign for his pending return to the field.

Kyle Monangai, RB, Chicago Bears

Rookie running back Kyle Monangai was listed as a non-participant in the Chicago Bears’ practice on Dec. 3 due to an ankle injury. Monangai had not previously appeared on the injury report with an ankle issue.

Chicago has held players out of practice throughout the season on Wednesdays, so there isn’t much reason for concern at this time. Monangai was upgraded to a limited participant on Thursday and is trending toward playing Week 14 against the Green Bay Packers.

Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR, Detroit Lions | Questionable

Amon-Ra St. Brown suffered an ankle injury during the first quarter of the Detroit Lions’ loss to the Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving Day. The veteran receiver attempted to return in the second half, but ultimately was not healthy enough to return to the field. Initial reports indicated that St. Brown avoided a major injury and suffered a traditional low ankle sprain.

The Lions have another Thursday night matchup in Week 14 against the Dallas Cowboys. That means that St. Brown will get a normal amount of rest, but won’t benefit from an additional couple of days to fully heal. St. Brown has been listed as a non-participant on both Monday and Tuesday this week, putting his status for Week 14 in doubt. He enters the game against the Dallas Cowboys with a questionable tag.

Detroit is also missing Kalif Raymond from its passing attack, so rookie Isaac TeSlaa and veteran Tom Kennedy will need to step up in the passing attack to keep the Lions’ playoff hopes alive in 2025.

Drake London, WR, Atlanta Falcons

Atlanta Falcons’ wide receiver Drake London has missed the last two games with a PCL injury. Head coach Raheem Morris spoke to reporters on Monday and stated that London was considered “day-to-day” at this point and had a chance of playing in Week 14 as long as he didn’t have any issues practicing throughout the week.

London did not practice on Wednesday, which is not a great first step toward his return to the starting lineup.

The Falcons have spread their passing attack between Kyle Pitts, Darnell Mooney, David Sills, and Dylan Drummond, with London sidelined.

Davante Adams, WR, Los Angeles Rams

Veteran wide receiver Davante Adams was listed as a non-participant in the Los Angeles Rams’ practice on Wednesday due to a hamstring injury. Head coach Sean McVay stated that he expected Adams to be ready to go when the Rams face off against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 14.

Tee Higgins, WR, Cincinnati Bengals

Tee Higgins missed the Cincinnati Bengals’ win over the Baltimore Ravens on Thanksgiving with a concussion that he suffered in Week 12 against the New England Patriots. According to head coach Zac Taylor, Higgins still hasn’t cleared the concussion protocol. He logged a limited practice on Wednesday, which is a positive sign.

There is still plenty of time for Higgins to complete the protocol, and his participation in practice throughout the week will indicate whether he is progressing without setbacks.

Rome Odunze, WR, Chicago Bears

Rome Odunze was listed as a non-participant during Wednesday’s practice for the Chicago Bears due to a foot injury. Odunze has missed Wednesday practices throughout the season due to a heel injury, but it is unclear if this is related to the issue.

Odunze has yet to miss a game due to this injury and, historically, is updated to a limited participant on Thursday. Unfortunately, Odunze was a non-participant on Thursday, which suggests something has changed (for the worse) with his injury.

There is still time for Odunze to upgrade to a limited participant on Friday, but for now, it appears that Odunze is trending toward missing Week 14. D.J. Moore, Luther Burden III, and Colston Loveland would absorb most of Odunze’s typical target share.

Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, Arizona Cardinals

Marvin Harrison Jr. returned to the Arizona Cardinals’ starting lineup in Week 13 after missing two games due to an appendectomy. Unfortunately, the second-year receiver suffered a heel injury during the game and could not return.

Head coach Jonathan Gannon has compared Harrison’s heel injury to cornerback Max Melton’s injury, noting that it was “tricky.” That injury also forced Melton to miss Week 13’s matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

RELATED: Cardinals Playoff Hopes Fade, Attention Shifts to 2026 NFL Draft Pick Placement

Time will tell whether the heel injury sidelines Harrison. However, he was not spotted at practice on Nov. 3 or Nov. 4, which suggests that he will miss at least one game, like Melton.

If he’s out, Michael Wilson and Greg Dortch once again become fantasy viable players after dominating with their increased workload with Harrison sidelined earlier in the season.

Mike Evans, WR, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Mike Evans suffered a broken collarbone in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ loss to the Detroit Lions in Week 7. At the time, the injury wasn’t believed to be season-ending, but there was also an expectation that Evans would miss nearly all of the regular season. Surprisingly, the Buccaneers activated Evans’ 21-day practice window this week, giving him a chance to return to the field for Week 14’s matchup against the New Orleans Saints.

The Buccaneers are currently just a half-game up on the Carolina Panthers in the NFC South, so they need all hands on deck to secure another division title. If the Buccaneers decide to give Evans a week to get his legs under him, then Emeka Egbuka, Chris Godwin, and Tez Johnson would lead the passing attack in Week 14.

Jayden Reed, WR, Green Bay Packers

The Green Bay Packers opened up Jayden Reed’s 21-day return window from the injured reserve on Nov. 21, which allowed Reed to log limited practices ahead of the team’s Thursday matchup against the Detroit Lions in Week 13, even though the veteran receiver was not expected to play. Reed has been out since September after having surgery on a broken collarbone and an unrelated foot injury he suffered during the summer.

On Monday, Packers’ head coach Matt LaFleur stated that the Packers would continue to ramp up Reed’s workload while the team waits for medical clearance for Reed to return to the field. The team has until Dec. 12 to make a final decision on Reed’s status, but there is a chance he can return to face off against the Chicago Bears in Week 14.

Matthew Golden, WR, Green Bay Packers

Green Bay Packers’ 2025 first-round pick Matthew Golden has missed the last two games with a wrist injury. On Monday, head coach Matt LaFleur described Golden as “potentially available” for Sunday’s matchup against the Chicago Bears.

Golden has struggled to find his footing this season and could return to even more target competition if veteran receiver Jayden Reed is also cleared to return. Golden may see himself as the odd player out in a receiving group that has found its stride with Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, and Dontayvion Wicks, plus Reed.

Josh Downs, WR, Indianapolis Colts

Josh Downs was a non-participant for the Indianapolis Colts on Dec. 3 with hip and knee injuries. Downs has missed practice with injuries in recent weeks, but has had no problem suiting up on Sunday.

Dalton Kincaid, TE, Buffalo Bills

Dalton Kincaid has missed the last three weeks for the Buffalo Bills, working through a hamstring injury. He was able to log limited practices last week before ultimately being ruled out on Sunday, suggesting he is close to a return. Kincaid was listed as a limited participant for the Bills’ practice on Dec. 3.

Kincaid may be in a heavier rotation than usual in Week 14, but he would still be in a smash spot against the Cincinnati Bengals if he’s able to return. Cincinnati is allowing over 15.7 fantasy points per game to tight ends in 2025. The difference between the Bengals and second place (5.4 points per game) is the equivalent of the difference between second and 31st in points allowed to tight ends per game.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/03120104/week-14-fantasy-football-injury-12-03-25.png,N,,2025-12-04 17:05:20.384994

Ernest Jones IV named NFC Defensive Player of the Week

The Seahawks have a 21-day window to activate each player to the 53-man roster or place them on injured reserve for the remainder of the season.

Head coach Mike Macdonald told reporters before practice they’ll evaluate whether each is activated for Sunday’s game against Atlanta throughout the week.

“We’ll see how it goes,” he said. “I know we have a certain amount of time to activate them, and we’ll either do it this week or we’ll do it another week.”

Macdonald did seem to indicate that Love, who has missed the past eight games with a hamstring injury, may not return this week, even if fully healthy.

“Let’s say everything went perfectly to plan, anytime you’re coming off a stretch where you’re not playing, you gotta have some sort of ramp back in,” Macdonald said of Love. “So that’s how we’re operating.”

In addition to Love, tight end AJ Barner (knee, shoulder), defensive end Rylie Mills (knee) and safety Ty Okada (oblique) were each limited participants in practice.

Seattle had five players listed with rest or non-injury related designations. Defensive linemen Leonard Williams and DeMarcus Lawrence did not practice while wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, linebacker Ernest Jones IV and backup quarterback Drew Lock were limited.

Right guard Anthony Bradford (elbow) and wide receiver Cody White (abdomen) were full participants. Bradford left Sunday’s win over Minnesota in the final minutes of the fourth quarter and did not return.

Macdonald also said veteran tight end Eric Saubert was “coming on strong” and could be a candidate to return to practice next week. Saubert was placed on IR with a calf injury on Nov. 1.

“He’s got some things he needs to hit this week rehab-wise, but optimistic that he’ll hit those things,” Macdonald said.

Carter missed the first three practices of training camp with a shoulder injury and has popped up several times on the injury report with the shoulder but hasn’t missed any games with it yet.
But even in the weeks he wasn’t on the injury report, he hasn’t seemed like quite the player he was last year.
Because they don’t play until Monday night, the Eagles won’t have an injury report this week until Thursday.
Asked how Carter played Friday, Fangio said: “Yeah, it was a lot like the rest of us, you know?","Jalen Carter hasn’t looked quite right all year, and in the loss to the Bears he played only 70.1 percent of the Eagles’ defensive snaps, his 3rd-lowest over the last two years.

Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said Wednesday the shoulder injury Carter first suffered before the start of training camp remains an issue and is affecting his play and his playing time.

Carter missed the first three practices of training camp with a shoulder injury and has popped up several times on the injury report with the shoulder but hasn’t missed any games with it yet.

He appeared on the injury report with the shoulder prior to the Cowboys opener and the Rams and Broncos games, and he was listed as limited the first day of practice before the Rams and Broncos games. But even in the weeks he wasn’t on the injury report, he hasn’t seemed like quite the player he was last year. He missed several series against Tampa with the shoulder, playing a season-low 47 snaps. He also missed the loss to the Giants with a heel injury.

Because they don’t play until Monday night, the Eagles won’t have an injury report this week until Thursday.

“He does have a shoulder issue,” Fangio said. “He's been playing with it. You know, late in the (Bears) game, he had a great play with it. But yeah, it's definitely something there.”

Carter on Friday picked up his second sack of the season as well as two tackles for loss and two pass breakups. But he was ineffective vs. the run, and the Bears rushed for 281 yards – 10th-most against the Eagles in their 94-year history.

Philadelphia Eagles

Carter, a Pro Bowler and 2nd-team all-pro last year in his first year as a starter, is down across the board in his production this year. His Pro Football Focus run defense grade ranks 94th out of 117 interior linemen who’ve played at least 200 snaps. Overall, he ranks 55th out of 117.

Asked how Carter played Friday, Fangio said: “Yeah, it was a lot like the rest of us, you know? Some good, some not good. I think we were all guilty of that.”

Overall, Carter’s snaps have dropped from last year. Carter played 79.4 percent of the Eagles' defensive snaps last year, and he's played 71.6 percent this year.

With Carter struggling with the shoulder Friday and the defense on the field for a season-high 87 snaps, Jordan Davis played a season-high 59 snaps, 2nd-most of his career; Moro Ojomo matched his career high with 62 snaps; and Byron Young played a career-high 38 snaps.",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/12/GettyImages-2249265599.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=1669px%2C723px%2C4344px%2C2445px&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-04 13:06:56.929495

Still, Jones is battling through the injury to not only play, but play at a level the Colts believe he can reach.

Take that for what it's worth – Pro Football Focus grades don't always match how teams internally evaluate their players. But the tape matches the grade (of 83.1), with Jones standing tall in the pocket and ripping throws all over the field against the Houston Texans. Another way to look at it: The Colts' dropback EPA per play of +.130 was the highest any team has had against Houston's stingy defense all season.

It didn't result in a win, or even crossing the 20-point mark. Tangible results are what impact the thing that counts – the Colts' win-loss record – and the Colts' 20-16 loss dropped them to 8-4. But the Colts remain confident in what Jones can do behind center, and do not feel like his fibula injury is condensing what they're able to get to as an offense.

""I think he's playing well, playing efficiently, spreading the ball around to guys, managing the offense within each weekly game plan against some pretty good defenses that throw different things at you and create different problems,"" offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter said. ""Doing a lot of good there. We're always conscious of all our guys, who's out there. Some guys are dealing with stuff throughout the NFL season, and we try to do what we can to put them in position to go have success.

""But like Shane said a few times, Daniel's sort of no restrictions. We're able to go out there and play ball and do whatever we can go do to beat our opponent.""

Jones on Wednesday was asked if his fibula injury was keeping him from moving outside the pocket; head coach Shane Steichen pointed out earlier this week one Jones' two touchdowns against the Texans came with him rolling to his right before connecting with tight end Tyler Warren.

""I feel good,"" Jones said. ""I think I'm feeling better every week, and continue to do more and more. I think, yeah, just being mindful of the injury and doing whatever I can to put the team in a position to win.""

Still, Jones is battling through the injury to not only play, but play at a level the Colts believe he can reach. And as the Colts look to get their 2025 season back on track for a critical final five-game stretch, Steichen also sees Jones' ability and willingness to play through his fibula injury as being inspirational to the other players on the Colts' roster.

""It's a huge impact,"" Steichen said. ""I mean, when a guy is out there dealing with an injury, it just shows the toughness and what he's willing to put on the line for the guys. I think that shows the guys how much he cares, that he wants to be out there with them and playing – still playing great ball.

,,2025-12-04 09:20:26+00:00,The Athletic,"What Tyler Seguin's injury means for Stars' salary cap, approach to trade deadline",Chris Johnston,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6859215/2025/12/03/tyler-seguin-injury-salary-cap-trade-deadline/,"Another season, another unfortunate injury setback for veteran forward Tyler Seguin.
“We didn’t get great news today,” Stars coach Glen Gulutzan told reporters Wednesday.
Under the new rules, the Stars can only replace Seguin’s full cap hit if he’s ruled out for the entirety of the regular season and playoffs.
Seguin is due to consult with doctors before a firm recovery and return-to-play timeline is established, according to a league source.
“He’s a great leader for us, and he’s a great pro,” said Gulutzan, in his first year since returning to the Stars bench.","Another season, another unfortunate injury setback for veteran forward Tyler Seguin.

However, due to recent changes to the NHL’s collective bargaining agreement, how his long-term absence impacts the Dallas Stars’ salary-cap picture could be a little different from the last time Seguin missed significant time to injury.

There was a sense of deja vu when the Stars announced Wednesday that Seguin suffered a torn ACL in his right knee, because it came almost one year to the day that the team announced his 2024-25 season was in jeopardy following hip surgery.

“We didn’t get great news today,” Stars coach Glen Gulutzan told reporters Wednesday.

Seguin suffered the latest injury during Tuesday’s game against the New York Rangers, when his leg got caught up with defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov while falling awkwardly to the ice. He needed assistance getting to the visitors dressing room at Madison Square Garden.

Gulutzan indicated that Seguin will be sidelined for months — “probably the rest of the season,” he later added — and where exactly the recovery timeline ends up will have a significant bearing on what the Stars can do to make up for his loss before the March 6 trade deadline.

Either way, they’re eligible for some relief under the league’s rules covering long-term injuries. The only question is whether it’s $3.82 million or the full $9.85 million on Seguin’s contract because of a revision to Section 50.10(d)(iii) in the recent CBA extension.

Under the new rules, the Stars can only replace Seguin’s full cap hit if he’s ruled out for the entirety of the regular season and playoffs. That would require him to be moved to season-ending LTI, which is irreversible. In the event he can play again before the end of the postseason, Dallas is limited to spending an amount equal to last season’s average salary on a replacement, which would be $3.82 million.

Seguin is due to consult with doctors before a firm recovery and return-to-play timeline is established, according to a league source.

With the Stars in win-now mode and off to a solid start — they were 17-5-5 heading into Wednesday’s game at the New Jersey Devils — they are expected to again be a big player leading into the trade deadline.

Last season, they added Mikko Rantanen in a blockbuster trade with the Carolina Hurricanes on March 7, after picking up Mikael Granlund and Cody Ceci from the San Jose Sharks on Feb. 1.

Under the previous rules, they made the finances work for those trades by having Seguin, Miro Heiskanen and Nils Lundkvist on LTI.

Seguin managed to work his way back from last year’s hip surgery with a diligent recovery program, playing in the Stars’ final regular-season game on April 16 and another 18 games in the playoffs during their third consecutive run to the Western Conference final.

The early indications suggest he likely won’t be in a position to do so again.

“He’s a great leader for us, and he’s a great pro,” said Gulutzan, in his first year since returning to the Stars bench. “He’s been a guy, quite frankly, that I’ve been maybe the most impressed with, just his leadership ability, when I’ve come in here.

“This is tough news for our whole group.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/03160523/USATSI_27724861-scaled-e1764796966219.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-04 09:02:52.838422

But even if they weren't inclined to keep Jones as their starter, the Colts' options are limited.

Anthony Richardson Sr., their 2023 fourth overall draft pick, remains on injured reserve and still is not cleared for football-related activities after sustaining an orbital fracture in his face in a freak pregame incident in October, coach Shane Steichen said Wednesday.

But Richardson is closer to gaining clearance from his doctors, and the Colts have not closed the door on him returning to the lineup before the end of the season, Steichen said.

Richardson's vision was temporarily impaired by the injury because of swelling and the resulting surgery that was required, leaving him with some blurriness in one eye that is now clearing, a source told ESPN.

There was initially serious concern about Richardson's eye in the immediate aftermath of the injury, multiple sources have said, with Richardson rushed to the hospital by paramedics. But he ultimately avoided damage to the eye and has come a long way since those initial days.

""Any time you're dealing with an eye, you want to make sure he's got full vision in that eye,"" Steichen said. ""He's resting it right now, and once he's cleared to go, I'll let you guys know.""

Steichen said Richardson is engaging in certain training activities in the weight room, a recent development. He also has returned to the team facility on a more regular basis after initially being advised by doctors to stay home and rest. He was prohibited from performing any strenuous tasks. But this week, Richardson attended his first Colts game since the injury and might travel with the team for its upcoming road games.

Richardson sustained the injury while warming up with an elastic stretch band in the locker room before the team's Oct. 12 home game against the Arizona Cardinals.

On Wednesday, Dec. 3, the Buccaneers opened the 21-day practice window for veteran wide receiver Mike Evans, according to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport. The 12-year NFL veteran broke his collarbone in Tampa Bay's Week 7 clash with the Detroit Lions, and he's missed five games since the injury.

Evans has missed a total of eight games this season with various injuries – a hamstring injury held him out for Weeks 4-6 before his more recent injury took him out for at least five games. It's unclear how much more time he'll miss, but his return to practice indicates the Buccaneers plan to activate him from injured reserve (IR) soon.

It's big news for the Buccaneers, who hold a half-game lead over the Carolina Panthers in the NFC South race. Tampa Bay just saw fellow veteran receiver Chris Godwin return in Week 12 and running back Bucky Irving return in Week 13. Evans is one of the last players the Bucs need to return to get back to full strength.

Here's the latest injury update for Evans:

When will Mike Evans return?

Evans has been on the IR since breaking his collarbone in Week 7, but the Bucs opened his 21-day practice window on Dec. 3, according to an NFL Media report. That means Tampa Bay has until Christmas Eve – Dec. 24 – to activate the veteran wide receiver or declare his season over.

Evans will return to practice in Week 14 and hope to avoid any setbacks ahead of a potential return in one of the final weeks of the regular season – just in time for a push to clinch the division and a playoff run.

Because Evans has missed so much time with his hamstring and collarbone injuries, his late-season return is too late to save his streak of consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. His run of prolific production will end after 11 seasons, leaving him tied for the all-time record.

Mike Evans stats

Unless Evans can stack together multiple games with more than 300 yards in each, his streak of 11 straight 1,000-yard seasons to begin his career will end in 2025. Here's how his stats look through 13 weeks and four games played:

Targets: 32

Receptions: 14

Receiving yards: 140

Yards/reception: 10

Touchdowns: 1

Last year, Evans reached 1,004 receiving yards in 14 games, tying him with Hall of Famer Jerry Rice for most consecutive 1,000-yard seasons in NFL history. The Buccaneers receiver is also the sole record-holder for most consecutive 1,000-yard seasons to begin a career and owns the franchise record in single-season receiving touchdowns (14 in 2021).

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

Ruled OUT

WR Kalif Raymond (ankle) — Not expected to play in Week 14

TE Brock Wright (neck)

TE Shane Zylstra (knee) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 18

S Kerby Joseph (knee)

Raymond was not expected to play this week, and he’ll miss his second straight game. Coach Dan Campbell said Raymond’s making progress, but the outlook on when he’ll be available again is unclear.

Wright missed practice this week as the team explored multiple opinions on his trachea injury. He’ll miss at least one more week and maybe more.

Zylstra just started his injury evaluation clock this week and missed practice on one of those days; he’s not ready to return to game action just yet.

Joseph practiced for the first time in nearly two months this week; however, the Lions appear to be taking things very slowly with him, and he’ll miss another game. Practicing is progress, but patience is necessary with this situation.

Questionable

RB Sione Vaki (thumb)

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle)

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder/rest) — Upgraded after a rest day on Tuesday

RT Penei Sewell (shoulder) — Upgraded to limited on Wednesday

G Kayode Awosika (foot) — Downgraded to no practice Wednesday

C Graham Glasgow (knee)

S Brian Branch (toe/ankle)

Vaki has played through his thumb injury for multiple games now, and this week should be no different.

St. Brown told the media he expected his availability to be a game-time decision. It appears we’re going to have to wait until 90 minutes before kickoff to know his injury designations. With some extra time to rest before the Lions’ Week 15 game, don’t be surprised if the Lions give him a week off. He was listed as “no practice” for Wednesday.

Decker continues to play through his season-long lingering shoulder injury, and after taking a rest day on Tuesday, he looks like he’s back on track to play this week.

Sewell spent over a month on the injury report for various ailments. Then on Monday, he was removed from the injury report entirely, only to be re-added on Tuesday with a shoulder injury. A questionable designation gives him a chance to play—and he was listed as limited on Wednesday. So there should be some optimism there.

Awosika got in a clean practice on Monday, then was added to the injury report on Tuesday with a foot injury. Most mid-week injuries are tough to recover from, especially on a short week, but a questionable designation is promising. But he, too, was a non-participant in Wednesday’s practice—so Detroit could be looking for a new left guard this week.

Glasgow has stacked a week’s worth of practices, and it looks like he’ll have a real chance to return to his starting center role this week.

Branch has had a few nagging injuries lingering over the past few weeks, but he’s managed to play through them and is expected to do the same this week.

Coach Jim Harbaugh said the Chargers are optimistic Herbert will play against the Eagles, but they are preparing backup quarterback Trey Lance to start if needed.","EL SEGUNDO, Calif -- Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who recently had surgery on his fractured left hand, did not practice Wednesday but said he is preparing to play Monday night against the Philadelphia Eagles.

""The plan is to prepare as if I'm going to play and see how the next couple of days goes,"" Herbert said. ""Do everything I can to be out there for the team and the guys out there.""

Herbert said he wasn't sure of the exact surgical details, only that doctors inserted a plate and screws to stabilize his hand. Herbert kept the injured hand tucked in his hoodie pocket Wednesday and said he was wearing a cast to protect it from contact.

Herbert participated in Wednesday's walk-through, a noncontact instructional practice, but said he still hasn't gripped a football, something he plans to attempt later this week.

Reducing swelling, he said, has been the primary focus.

""It's been the most important thing the past couple of days,"" he said.

Herbert was hurt in the first quarter Sunday, when Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn hit Herbert on a scramble, and Chinn's helmet appeared to connect directly with Herbert's non-throwing hand.

Herbert stayed in the game, clearly favoring the hand, and threw a touchdown to wide receiver Quentin Johnston on the next play. He eventually went to the locker room and missed nine plays while a hard cast and glove were applied to his left hand.

The Chargers didn't take a snap under center for the remainder of the game, as Herbert said he struggled to grip the ball.

Herbert said he hasn't spoken with the team's medical staff but anticipates wearing a hard cast again if he plays.

Two seasons ago, Herbert fractured the middle finger on his left hand; the Chargers primarily played out of the shotgun to manage that injury

If Herbert doesn't take any reps at practice this week, he believes he could still play Monday, noting he's done that before.

Herbert has only had two injuries that caused him to miss practice: a high right ankle sprain last season and a fractured rib cartilage in 2022. Herbert played through both.

The only games Herbert missed due to injury were in 2023, when he fractured the index finger on his throwing hand and couldn't grip a football.

""It's not ideal,"" Herbert said of potentially playing without practicing. ""It's definitely difficult in this league, but if that's the case and if Coach feels like I'll get the best shot for the team, then I trust his decision.""

Coach Jim Harbaugh said the Chargers are optimistic Herbert will play against the Eagles, but they are preparing backup quarterback Trey Lance to start if needed.

Even if Herbert suits up, Lance might handle under center situations -- typically coming in goal-line or short yardage -- if Herbert's grip remains an issue.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1204%2Fr1584532_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 01:01:19.323484

Dallas Cowboys at Detroit Lions (-3)

Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET | Stream on Prime Video

Dallas Cowboys: LT Tyler Guyton (ankle), CB Trevon DIggs (knee) OUT; DE Jadeveon Clowney (hamstring), S Malik Hooker (back) QUESTIONABLE

Detroit Lions: S Kerby Joseph (knee), WR Kalif Raymond (ankle), TE Brock Wright (neck), TE Shane Zylstra (knee) OUT; LG Kayode Awosika (foot), S Brian Branch (toe/ankle), LT Taylor Decker (shoulder/rest), C Graham Glasgow (knee), RT Penei Sewell (shoulder), WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (ankle), RB Sione Vaki (thumb) QUESTIONABLE

The Dallas Cowboys will be without starting left tackle Tyler Guyton (ankle) for the second week in a row, so once again, 2024 seventh-round pick Nate Thomas will start in his place. Dallas opted to not yet activate Pro Bowl cornerback Trevon Diggs (knee) this week after his 21-day practice window opened on Sunday. Edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney (hamstring) and safety Malik Hooker (back) will be game-time decisions.

Detroit may or may not have their No. 1, All-Pro wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown in Week 14. He suffered a low ankle sprain on Thanksgiving in Week 13 against the Green Bay Packers that knocked him out of that matchup. That's why Detroit officially listed as questionable for Week 14.

Linebacker Kaden Elliss (vet rest day) was limited.

Marvin Harrison Jr.'s heel injury kept the wide receiver out of Wednesday's practice. The issue, which occurred against the Buccaneers over the weekend, is similar to the heel injury cornerback Max Melton sustained against the Jaguars according to coach Jonathan Gannon.

When asked how Harrison was feeling, Gannon said he was doing ""OK."" If the Cardinals top wideout can't go, at least there is confidence in what Michael Wilson had been able to do as WR1 against the 49ers and Jaguars.

Harrison was one of the seven players that did not participate during Wednesday's practice. The others were Melton (heel), running back Trey Benson (knee), wide receiver Greg Dortch (chest), right tackle Kelvin Beachum (groin), outside linebacker Josh Sweat (NIR-rest), defensive lineman Walter Nolen III (knee), and safety Dadrion Taylor-Demerson (ankle).

The clock is ticking on Benson's return. Wednesday marked the third consecutive practice that he has missed since his practice window was opened two weeks ago. He must be activated to the 53-man roster by Dec. 10, and if he isn't, he will be relegated to Injured Reserve for the rest of the season.

The encouraging news for the Cardinals offense was Emari Demercado's return to practice after missing the last two games. He's the best pass blocking running back and can provide a balance with Bam Knight and Michael Carter.

In L.J. Collier's first practice back from IR, the defensive lineman was limited. The other limited participant was offensive lineman Christian Jones (knee).",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cardinals/ecjukvssakxc0n0nxoat,N,,2025-12-03 20:01:29.663321

Sunday will feature a showdown between the top-two teams in the AFC North, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens will host the Steelers knowing they've locked up their all-time leading receiver for the foreseeable future. They announced Wednesday that they've signed tight end Mark Andrews to a three-year extension, which is reportedly worth $39.3 million.

Elsewhere, Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans returned to practice Wednesday after breaking his clavicle in October. Evans reportedly healed faster than expected and will have his 21-day practice window opened, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

The Cleveland Browns, meanwhile, are designating Deshaun Watson to return to practice. This designation opens Watson's 21-day window for the team to decide whether or not he's healthy enough to be activated. Since being traded to Cleveland from Houston, Watson has played in just 19 games, primarily due to an 11-game suspension handed down by the NFL following multiple sexual misconduct allegations and injuries.

The Kansas City Chiefs revealed some rough news Wednesday as left tackle Josh Simmons is going on injured reserve after having surgery on his left wrist, head coach Andy Reid told reporters.

They remain in the thick of the AFC playoff picture and may have reinforcements on the way ahead of their Week 14 ""Monday Night Football"" matchup against the reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles.

Rookie running back Omarion Hampton has missed seven straight games after suffering an ankle injury in Week 5 but recently returned to practice.

Hampton was the top running back for Los Angeles at the time of his injury, and a playmaker Justin Herbert and Jim Harbaugh could lean on. Hampton had accumulated a team-high 314 rushing yards before his injury.

Najee Harris suffered a torn Achilles, and Hampton was expected to take on a larger workload. He

The Chargers are in contention, but they'll hope their rookie can give their offense an element it's been missing for much of the season. The No. 22 overall pick was leading all rookies in scrimmage yards with 380 before his injury in Week 5.

Here's the latest on the Chargers running back:

When will Omarion Hampton return?

The rookie running back had his 21-day practice window opened in Week 13.

Hampton returned to practice after the Chargers' bye and logged three limited practices before being ruled out of Week 13.

The Chargers will have two more weeks to activate him back onto the 53-man roster. On Wednesday, Dec. 3, Harbaugh was asked about Hampton's potential return for Week 14. “That question will be answered as the week unfolds. But what can I tell you, he’s on track and looking good,” per NFL Network.

Hampton was seen practicing in a yellow, non-contact jersey on Wednesday.

Earlier this week, Harbaugh told reporters, ""We opened his window, and we certainly wouldn't have done that - his 21-day window - if he wasn't close. Again, feel like he's been on track and let the week play out,"" Harbaugh said on Monday, Dec. 1.

Hampton was placed on injured reserve after Week 5, which required him to be sidelined for at least four games. The earliest Hampton was able to return from IR was Week 10.

The Chargers host the Eagles on Monday. It remains to be seen whether Hampton will be activated for the matchup, but all signs point to a positive outcome this week.

Last week, offensive coordinator Greg Roman said he planned on using both Kimani Vidal and Hampton in a ""1-2 punch"" shared backfield when the rookie returns.

Kimani Vidal has stepped up and led the backfield. He leads the backfield with 121 rushing attempts for 543 yards and three touchdowns. Vidal rumbled for 126 yards in the Chargers' win over the Raiders, and 124 of those 126 rushing yards came after contact. He also netted a league-high 11 missed tackles forced.

The team recently placed Haskins on IR, further thinning the room. Trayveon Williams was called up from the practice squad for the Chargers' Week 11 game against the Jaguars and was forced into action when Vidal suffered a thigh injury.

In Week 13, Los Angeles elevated Jaret Paterson from the practice squad who chipped in behind Vidal.

The team eagerly awaits the return of their first-round rookie with the running back room thin.

On the run defense “The biggest issues were, 1) they run the ball very well.
I didn’t do a good enough job preparing our squad for the quality and the diversity of their run game.
“[Jalen Carter] does have a shoulder issue.
He noted that Nakobe Dean has been strong against the run game, and with the issues they were having in that area, Fangio felt Dean would be better equipped to help.","The Eagles are preparing for the Chargers on Monday night, but defensive coordinator Vic Fangio spoke to reporters on Wednesday, and answered a few more questions about the defense’s issues against the Bears last week. He explained that the run defense wasn’t good enough, why that will be a problem against Los Angeles, and also touched on Jalen Carter dealing with a shoulder injury.

Fangio was also asked about the possibility of getting Darius Slay back — with reports Wednesday there is mutual interest between the veteran CB and the Eagles — he just smiled and said that was a question for Howie Roseman.

Here’s what the DC had to say:

On safety Marcus Epps

Fangio admitted that if Epps — who was activated from IR this week — is ready to play on Monday night, there’s a chance he’s in with the starters.

“He’s an experienced safety. He’s got good instincts, got a good feel for the game. We’ll have to get a feel, a barometer [of] where he’s at missing the last four, five weeks, whatever it was where he couldn’t practice, anyway.”

When asked about Sydney Brown’s start at safety last week, Fangio said that it was much like the rest of the defense, which had some good and some bad.

On the run defense

“The biggest issues were, 1) they run the ball very well. I didn’t do a good enough job preparing our squad for the quality and the diversity of their run game. And, we didn’t play the run and the blocks the way we had been playing.”

Fangio reiterated several times that the issues with the run defense were both from a technique standpoint, and the he hadn’t coached things well enough.

He also acknowledged that they’re going to face another good running team, noting the Chargers have put up 200-yard rushing performances against two teams already this season. Later, Fangio said that they’ll have to play the run well enough that they don’t go to that a bunch, and not give up much in the play-action game.

As for how Jaelan Phillips is acclimating to his new team, Fangio said it’s going very well.

“He likes being here, the other players like him being here. He’s a good dude, and we’re thrilled to have him.”

On Jalen Carter’s performance

Fangio echoed for Carter what he did with others, noting that his performance had good and bad moments, just like they were all guilty of against the Bears.

“[Jalen Carter] does have a shoulder issue. He’s been playing with it — late in the game, he had a great game with it, but yeah, it’s definitely something there.”

He later said that it’s possible for rookie Ty Robinson to get more opportunities as Carter deals with the shoulder injury — Robinson has been a weekly healthy scratch as the depth has been needed elsewhere up to this point of the season.

On Jihaad Campbell’s contributions

The DC admitted that he probably should have gotten rookie Jihaad Campbell on the field for a few snaps against Chicago. He noted that Nakobe Dean has been strong against the run game, and with the issues they were having in that area, Fangio felt Dean would be better equipped to help.

Fangio said that the plan moving forward, though, will probably be to find ways to get Campbell some snaps, but they’ll have to see how the game is going to know what situations for which that would be best.

In addition to Harmon, several other players are dealing with injuries this week and Tomlin said they would be 'questionable' to start the week.
Among them are linebacker Patrick Queen (glute), cornerback James Pierre (concussion protocol) and quarterback Aaron Rodgers (wrist).
You can characterize Aaron Rodgers within that group as well.""","The Steelers began their preparation for Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium, practicing inside at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex.

Quarterback Aaron Rodgers didn't practice, something Coach Mike Tomlin indicated during his weekly press conference when he said he would among those who would be limited to start the week.

Rodgers said after practice he felt like the wrist was healing.

""I didn't come out of the game any worse for wear,"" said Rodgers.

Rodgers started last week against the Bills, missing only a series when he was hit in the nose and bleeding.

""I feel good about what we can do offensively,"" said Tomlin. ""I don't think we're limited in any way. Certainly, we're going to do some things a little bit different to accommodate present circumstances, like we worked almost exclusively out of gun or pistol a week ago to minimize some of that. There will probably be less of a discussion this week. We'll see as the week wears on.

""Certainly, I think he came out of the game, at least physically from a wrist injury perspective, in a good place.""

For the second straight week they will be without rookie defensive lineman Derrick Harmon.

Harmon, who suffered a knee injury two weeks ago against the Chicago Bears, has already been ruled out for this week.

Harmon has become one of the key components of stopping the run, and last week the Steelers gave up 249 yards rushing against the Bills.

While Harmon's absence wasn't the only factor, finding consistency in the run defense is something they are searching for.

Coach Mike Tomlin was asked how you shore up the problems, whether it be focusing on smaller details or a global approach.

""I think you approach it from both perspectives,"" said Tomlin. ""You've got to put a lot of lines in the water. Certainly, we're looking at strategic, global things from a strategy or schematic standpoint, but we're also looking at the division of labor and the positions we put players in, how we adjust, adapt, and communicate, particularly when that gets strained due to player availability or lack thereof.

""So, some of those things, and all of those things are a component of the decision-making process.

""I think you have to look at each one of those things individually -- the plans, the players available to us, the schematics of those that we compete against. I think that's the challenge and the beautiful thing about this league is that week in and week out you start anew.

""Certainly, particularly at this point in the year, some evidence of who you are, and evidence of who your opponents are, but from a strategy standpoint, you'd better start at ground zero. You'd better build, and that's what we're in the process of doing today and this week in an effort to put out a better performance this week.""

In addition to Harmon, several other players are dealing with injuries this week and Tomlin said they would be 'questionable' to start the week.

Among them are linebacker Patrick Queen (glute), cornerback James Pierre (concussion protocol) and quarterback Aaron Rodgers (wrist).

""When I characterize people as questionable, oftentimes it means limited participation at the early part of the week and then increased participation as the week goes on and the quality and quantity of that participation being our guide towards availability,"" said Tomlin.

""The guys that fall into that category, Patrick Queen with his glute injury, and some other guys with bumps and bruises associated with play.

""James Pierre is in the concussion protocol, and I never really try to provide too much color regarding that. The medical experts make that determination, but he's in the protocol and could be listed as questionable as we sit here today.

""I would imagine we've got some other guys that lack availability associated with bumps and bruises, associated with play this time of year that could be limited in the top part of the week, but we expect those guys to pick up as the week goes on. You can characterize Aaron Rodgers within that group as well.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/steelers/i4b6iyn2969pv9jexmfg,N,,2025-12-03 18:04:41.080192

Elsewhere, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Mike Evans is expected to return to practice Wednesday after breaking his clavicle in October. Evans reportedly healed faster than expected and will have his 21-day practice window opened, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

The Cleveland Browns, meanwhile, are designating Deshaun Watson to return to practice. This designation opens Watson's 21-day window for the team to decide whether or not he's healthy enough to be activated. Since being traded to Cleveland from Houston, Watson has played in just 19 games, primarily due to an 11-game suspension handed down by the NFL following multiple sexual misconduct allegations and injuries.

The Kansas City Chiefs revealed some rough news Wednesday as left tackle Josh Simmons is going on injured reserve after having surgery on his left wrist, head coach Andy Reid told reporters. Simmons, whom the Chiefs selected in the first round of this year's draft, previously missed four games this season because of an undisclosed family matter.

NFL Week 14 FAQs","A team’s NFL schedule is another part of the handicapping process. Is the team coming off a Monday night game, making a short week even shorter? Another question we must ask is who do they play the following week? Is this upcoming game being taken for granted as they look ahead to a divisional rival, resulting in the infamous “trap game”?

Let’s take a look at the league’s most notable injuries and some of its top players who made NFL news for all the wrong reasons, and how their absences may affect the NFL spreads this week.

Injured Key Players

Justin Herbert (Chargers)

The Los Angeles Chargers injury report shows quarterback Justin Herbert suffering a fracture to his non-throwing hand in LA’s 31-14 win over the Raiders. However, Herbert has stated that he believes he will be available to play this upcoming week, despite having undergone hand surgery to repair the injury.

The Chargers will welcome the Eagles to SoFi Stadium on Monday night, where the oddsmakers have installed the home team as three-point underdogs. However, Herbert’s status could impact those odds, so keep your eyes peeled on Herbert’s progress, or lack thereof.

Omario Hampton (Chargers)

The Chargers’ first-round pick has been on the shelf since he suffered a left ankle fracture in Week 5 against the Washington Commanders. However, his time on the injured reserve has come to a close, and he was rumored to return last week but did not.

However, an extra week of rest greatly increases his chances of returning to action this week when the Bolts welcome the Eagles.

Amon-Ra St. Brown (Lions)

Detroit’s most lethal weapon, Amon-Ra St. Brown, suffered an ankle injury last week in the team’s 31-24 loss to the Packers. St. Brown did not practice on Tuesday, but Lions coach Dan Campbell has not ruled him out for the TNF game against the Cowboys, where the oddsmakers have installed Detroit as three-point home favorites.

Aaron Jones Sr. (Vikings)

The Vikings’ NFL injury report includes one of the team’s two tailbacks, veteran Aaron Jones Sr., who has been beset with injuries this season. Jones left during Minnesota’s 26-0 loss to the Seahawks with a shoulder injury, but it doesn’t appear serious, and he may find his way back to the field on Sunday.

The Vikings are narrow one-point home favorites over the Commanders, and if Jones is ruled out, Jordan Mason will see the majority of work in the backfield.

Drake London (Falcons)

One of the game’s most dynamic receivers, Drake London, has been sidelined since going down with a knee injury in Week 11 against the Panthers. He is now considered day-to-day and could suit up for Week 14’s tilt against the Seahawks, where the oddsmakers have installed Seattle as seven-point road chalk.

Other Injuries to Watch Out For

Player Position/Team Status Impact on Betting Alvin Kamara RB/Saints Questionable Kamara sat out last week’s loss to the Dolphins after injuring his knee the previous week. But Kamara’s MCL strain is on the mend, and he will likely return against the Bucs as nine-point road dogs. Tee Higgins WR/Bengals Questionable The Bengals’ No. 2 target missed last week’s upset win over the Ravens, but he may be cleared from the league’s concussion protocol list and be activated against the Bills on Sunday, where the Cats are 5 ½ point road dogs. Sam Darnold QB/Seahawks Questionable Sam Darnold is one name the Seahawks don’t want to see on their injury report, but the ankle injury he suffered last week is not severe, and he is expected to start this week when the team travels to Atlanta as seven-point road favorites. Jayden Daniels QB/Commanders Questionable Daniels has been sidelined since dislocating his non-throwing left elbow three weeks ago. However, he is optimistic about returning this week when the Commanders travel to Minnesota as one-point road dogs. Dalton Kincaid TE/Bills Questionable Josh Allen’s big target has been out since suffering a hamstring injury in Week 10 against Miami.

However, he is nearing a return, and that’s nothing but good news for Josh Allen and the Bills’ offense when they take on the Bengals this week.

Betting Tips for NFL Week 14

Quick Points on Interpreting Statuses Like “Doubtful” or “Probable.”

The league has a protocol for designating injuries, from likely to OUT. “Doubtful” merely means the player is unlikely to play, while “probable” means the opposite: it is likely he will play.

How to Adjust Bets Based on Injury Updates

Teams with injured offensive superstars will score fewer points if they are a favourite and get more points if they are an underdog. However, betting low on totals is always an option, as those weapons have been removed from the field.

Conversely, injured defensive stars can lead to higher totals. The best strategy is to assign a line and total based on the injury report before looking at the actual odds and total for the game, so you won’t be influenced. The bigger the difference between your line and the oddsmakers’ line, the more likely it is to reveal an opportunity to exploit that difference.

General Advice for This Week’s Betting Landscape

Jayden Daniels’ injury likely spells more doom and gloom for the Commanders after a spectacular 2024 campaign. Although Marcus Mariota is a capable backup, the Lions are probably the last team the Commanders want to face after this devastating injury, currently mired in the muck of a 3-6 season.

The NFL odds at BetUS show Washington getting 9 ½ points at home, and even that might not be enough to get the ATS cover.

Look, if you’ve followed along with the 2025 NFL season, you probably know what team I’m about to focus on here. If the conversation is about the cumulative effect of injuries on a team this year, that starts and ends with the 49ers.

They already knew they were going to be missing Brandon Aiyuk for much of the season, and from that point have also sustained injuries to Nick Bosa, George Kittle, Fred Warner, Ben Bartch, Brock Purdy, and Ricky Pearsall, among others. As a result, they’ve lost the most potential productivity to injury of any team in the NFL.

Most Value Lost To Injury, 2025 NFL season (through Week 13)

Team Games Missed Total Points Missed 49ers 206 156 Cardinals 177 151 Bengals 115 142 Commanders 143 136 Dolphins 169 123 Bills 212 123 Giants 192 116 Buccaneers 186 116 Falcons 140 114 Chargers 194 109 Saints 152 103 Panthers 133 95 Colts 176 91 Lions 226 89 Bears 240 84 Steelers 183 83 Ravens 128 73 Chiefs 123 71 Jaguars 110 70 Texans 167 65 Packers 157 64 Titans 116 63 Vikings 122 63 Cowboys 177 62 Raiders 62 57 Jets 130 54 Seahawks 160 53 Broncos 128 49 Eagles 111 40 Browns 113 35 Rams 97 35 Patriots 107 25

The value we’re measuring here is each injured player’s Total Points per game over his previous 17 games, multiplied by the number of games missed due to injury. This only counts injuries sustained since August 1.

The Walking Wounded

The Bengals have had substantially fewer total games missed to injury, but Joe Burrow’s loss alone cost them as many points as half the teams in the NFL have suffered in total this year. Without that injury they’d rank in the fortunate half of teams.

The Commanders are at the top of this list because of Jayden Daniels’ injury-plagued season. But they have also missed wide receiver Terry McLaurin, running back Austin Ekeler, safety Will Harris, and defensive end Deatrich Wise.

Kyler Murray’s injury has not affected the Cardinals’ fortunes as much as you’d think because backup Jacoby Brissett has been more than serviceable, but he still ranks among the most impactful injuries of the year by Total Points. Running back James Conner has been a favorite of Total Points for a little bit now, so his absence also looms relatively large.

Others Receiving Votes

A training camp injury to tackle Rashawn Slater started the ball rolling early for the 10th-ranked Chargers, and the hits kept coming as opposite tackle Joe Alt has dealt with multiple ailments. Los Angeles has more games missed than all but the 49ers and Bills in terms of Total Points missed.

The Lions and Bears have the most games missed due to injury in the league, but they rank just 14th and 15th respectively in Total Points missed. They’ve been fortunate to not have their biggest names go down so far this year, although the Lions’ fortunes have turned a bit recently with injuries to Sam LaPorta and Amon-Ra St. Brown.

Dodging Raindrops

The Patriots and Rams are the most fortunate teams so far in terms of health, which sheds a little light on their strong showings this year.

The Colts have not ruled out Richardson returning this season, but there is no certain timeline.

INDIANAPOLIS — Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson is not close to being cleared to return to action after undergoing surgery to repair a broken orbital bone suffered in a freak pregame accident involving a resistance band, coach Shane Steichen said.

Richardson has returned to the team facility, and he has started doing some physical work in the gym but he is not doing football activities yet.

“It’s an eye issue,” Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen said. “We’re just waiting for that to get clearance. Any time you’re dealing with an eye, you want to make sure he’s got full vision in that eye. He’s resting it right now.”

Richardson has been on injured reserve for seven weeks.

Indianapolis has installed rookie quarterback Riley Leonard in Richardson’s place as the backup, and the Colts have veteran Brett Rypien on the practice squad. Until Richardson is able to start doing football work, the backup quarterback situation will stay that way.

“(Richardson's) just doing some stuff in the weight room right now, getting back into it,” Steichen said.

The Colts haven’t ruled out the possibility of Richardson returning this season.

At the same time, it is not a certainty he will be back before the end of the year.

“We’re hopeful for that,” Steichen said. “He’s just resting his eye right now.

The Indianapolis Colts entered the 2025 NFL season with high expectations, quickly rising to the top of their division standings. However, recent developments have slowed their momentum, as the team now sits in second place. Quarterback Daniel Jones’ fractured fibula has emerged as a key factor affecting the Colts’ offensive efficiency and overall performance. While Jones remains active on the field, the injury has clearly limited his mobility, raising concerns about how sustainable the Colts’ early-season success will be. With Anthony Richardson on Injured Reserve, Indianapolis’ depth at quarterback is limited, leaving Jones as the primary option despite his compromised condition.

The impact of Daniel Jones’ fractured Fibula on the Colts’ offense

According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, Jones can technically play through the fractured fibula, but his movement appears restricted. “He’s clearly not 100 percent, and coaches who have prepared for the Colts or watched them closely say that his mobility appears compromised,” Fowler reported. Limited mobility affects a quarterback’s ability to escape pressure, execute designed runs, and maintain timing with receivers—all critical for maintaining an effective offense.

Daniel Jones Broke His Fibula and Wants to Play Through the Pain - Doctor Explains

During Indianapolis’ recent loss to the Houston Texans, Jones connected on several downfield throws when the pocket remained clean, demonstrating flashes of his skill. However, ESPN analyst Dan Graziano highlighted that the missing mobility made the offense appear constrained, reducing options and forcing the Colts to rely more heavily on short, safe passes. While injuries alone do not explain the Colts’ drop to second place, Jones’ health has been a central component in their performance challenges this season.

What the Colts must do to stay competitive moving forward

With rookie Riley Leonard as the backup, the Colts’ options are limited. Indianapolis will need to maximize Jones’ contributions while minimizing risk, a balancing act that will be critical over the next stretch of games. How the coaching staff adjusts the offensive game plan around his limitations could determine whether the Colts reclaim the top spot in their division or face continued difficulties. Jones’ ability to perform under these conditions will remain a focal point for analysts and insiders, as the Colts navigate the rest of the 2025 season.

Watson has spent the entire season on the physically unable to perform list after he ruptured his Achilles tendon last October, then suffered the injury again in January while rehabbing.

Though Watson’s return to practice leaves open the possibility that he’ll be activated in the next three weeks, the 3-9 Browns right now are focused on Watson just returning to the practice field with his teammates for the first time in almost 14 months. Even if Watson is activated, there is no guarantee he will play this season.

“(Playing) is not really my focus with (Watson) right now,” Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said Wednesday. “It’s not his focus right this minute. His focus is on putting on a helmet, putting on shoulder pads, throwing a football. He’s worked really, really hard and done everything he’s been asked. He’s been really supportive of his teammates.”

Watson will be listed as a limited practice participant on Wednesday’s injury report. He’s been with the team since the spring and has worked out individually with the team’s training staff during standard practice days.

In March, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam called the team’s 2022 trade for Watson “a big swing and miss.” The Browns gave Watson $230 million guaranteed and traded three first-round picks to Houston to acquire him, but the results haven’t come close to matching the investment.

Watson has started 19 games over three seasons with the Browns. He was limited to six games in 2023 after serving an 11-game suspension for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy, and each of his last two seasons has been ended by injury and subsequent surgeries. Watson has completed 61 percent of his passes in a Cleveland uniform, and the Browns are 9-10 in games he’s started.

The Browns still have a huge financial commitment to Watson, who counts just under $36 million on the team’s 2025 salary cap and is currently scheduled to count for just over $80 million in 2026. The Browns have re-worked Watson’s contract multiple times to lower his cap numbers and could do so again after this season.

Stefanski called Watson’s return to practice “a big next step” but reiterated that the team is focused on this week’s game versus Tennessee and rookie Shedeur Sanders’ third start.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/03110224/GettyImages-2248149808-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-03 14:07:04.026626

Even before the Bosa injury, it was feeling like it was just a matter of time before the Bills elevated Fox.","ORCHARD PARK - While the Buffalo Bills defense has played better lately, the pass rush continues to be less than impactful, and now it will be without its most productive edge rusher.

Coach Sean McDermott said that Joey Bosa’s hamstring injury, which he suffered last Sunday in Pittsburgh, is likely a week-to-week situation which means unless something unexpected happens in the next few days, he won’t be playing in Sunday’s game at Highmark Stadium against the Cincinnati Bengals.

“From what I’m being told, we’re thinking a week-to-week type of deal,” McDermott said Wednesday before the Bills conducted a walk-through practice. “But that can be perceived one of two ways. Is it week-to-week? Is it one week? Or is it like week-to-week as in four or five weeks? So we’re hoping on the shorter end of it. Joey’s intent on getting back as soon as he can, he loves to play, and so you saw his impact last week there.”

Hamstrings are notoriously tricky and the Bills’ medical staff routinely slow plays the return of players from that soft tissue injury because the risk of tweaking it and making it worse is a concern. Tight end Dalton Kincaid has missed the last three games, and linebacker Shaq Thompson has missed five games across two different stints, so it would not be a surprise if Bosa will be down several weeks.

Other players on Buffalo Bills injury report

Elsewhere on the injury front, McDermott said that wide receiver and Joshua Palmer and linebacker Terrel Bernard would not practice and like Bosa, it seems unlikely either will play. Bernard is assuredly out with a dislocated elbow, and Palmer has an ankle injury and McDermott sounded an alarm about his availability.

“He’s not in the best place right now just in terms of his body and the injuries he was dealing with, and he’s still dealing with them,” McDermott said. “So we’ll just have to see how it goes through the week here. But we’ve had good communication around his situation and with him specifically, and the key is that he continues to get himself healthy here one day at a time.”

Kincaid and offensive tackles Dion Dawkins (concussion) and Spencer Brown (shoulder) were limited at practice, so their game availability will be in question all week.

Bosa’s fragility over his last few seasons with the Chargers was always the No. 1 reason why the Bills signing him to a one-year, $12 million deal, one that pushes money out for four void years, was a risk. However, he has played in the first 12 games and has been Buffalo’s best edge rusher which is an issue in itself for a team that just gave Greg Rousseau - who is five years younger - a hefty contract extension.

Bosa leads the Bills in sacks (5), tackles for loss (8), QB hits (11) and QB pressures (41), and he leads the NFL with five forced fumbles. So yeah, if he can’t play against Burrow and the Bengals, that’s a problem.

Who will Bills turn to without Joey Bosa vs Bengals

With Michael Hoecht and rookie Landon Jackson lost for the season, the only healthy edge rushers on the 53-man roster are Rousseau, AJ Epenesa, and Javon Solomon, but Solomon is not a player you want to give more snaps to. If Bosa can’t play, this might be the week the Bills use their first practice squad elevation on veteran Morgan Fox who has been with the team for about three weeks.

Fox has 120 games and 34 starts on his NFL resume which began in 2016 with the Rams and has taken him to the Panthers, Chargers and now the Bills. One of his calling cards was versatility and in his three seasons with the Chargers he lined up in all four defensive line spots a similar amount of snaps.

He’s essentially what the Bills wanted Hoecht to be up front, a chess piece who can be moved around depending on the situation and the offensive formation.

Even before the Bosa injury, it was feeling like it was just a matter of time before the Bills elevated Fox. Solomon played just 25 snaps combined in the last three games as the Bills opted to use rookie DT TJ Sanders out of position on the edge because Solomon was giving them nothing, especially against the run. But Sanders hasn’t been any better playing a position that is completely new to him, so moving forward with him on the outside is untenable.

“We’ll see how it goes,” McDermott said when asked whether Fox might get the chance to play in place of Bosa.

According to Ian Rapoport, it is a fracture that Jones is working through.

It is an injury that Jones and Shane Steichen have said that the quarterback can play with, and he will continue to do so. However, that does not mean that there isn't some sort of impact that comes with having to navigate such an injury on Sundays.

ESPN NFL insiders Jeremy Fowler and Dan Graziano recently emptied their notebooks with what they're hearing around the league. One of the topics of conversation in this week's article was Jones' injury.

""He's clearly not 100 percent,"" wrote Folwer, ""and coaches I've talked to who have watched the Colts closely say his mobility appears compromised.""

Graziano had this to say:

""I spoke with some folks in Houston after the Texans-Colts game Sunday and they said they felt Jones really couldn't move at all. He was able to hit some shots downfield when the pocket held up, but the mobility part of his game is missing, which makes the offense seem more limited.""

Along with Jones' injury, Graziano mentions the impact on defense with Indianapolis not having DeForest Buckner in the middle of that front. He is currently on injured reserve with a neck injury.

Houston was very efficient against the Colts' defense on third downs in last week's game.

At 8-4, the Colts are tied in the wins and losses column with the Jacksonville Jaguars -- although it is Jacksonville who holds the current tie-breaker and AFC South lead.

With two meetings with the Jaguars over the final five games, the Colts can still control their own destiny when it comes to the division, but they'll have to navigate a difficult schedule. And doing so will also require much improved play from the offense as a whole.","https://coltswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/02/SCLT/87568955007-usatsi-27710193.jpg?crop=4516,2541,x0,y284&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-03 14:07:07.822219

Watson, 30, hasn't played since rupturing his right Achilles tendon last October, which sidelined him for the final 10 games of the 2024 season. He underwent a second surgery in January after retearing his Achilles, and the Browns announced that he would miss significant time in 2025.

The designation opens a 21-day practice window for Watson, who will be limited in practice Wednesday and will conduct individual drills. Stefanski said the next step for Watson could include scout team quarterback reps.

""His focus, my focus, is obviously getting him back to playing football, practicing football, which he hasn't done in over a year,"" Stefanski said. ""So, it's a good next step for him.""

The Browns will have to activate Watson to the 53-man roster at the conclusion of the practice window or he will be sidelined for the remainder of the season. Stefanski said it wasn't his focus when asked if it was the organization's desire to see Watson in a game before the end of the season.

Suspension and injuries have limited Watson to just 19 games since the Browns traded three first-round picks to the Houston Texans and gave him a fully guaranteed $230 million contract in March 2022.

Watson began his Browns tenure serving an 11-game suspension after more than two dozen women accused him of sexual assault and inappropriate conduct during massage sessions. Watson also missed the final eight games of the 2023 season after undergoing surgery to his throwing shoulder.

Since making his debut with the Browns, Watson has posted a 33.1 Total QBR, which would rank only above Tennessee Titans rookie Cam Ward if Watson had enough starts to qualify. In March, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam called the Watson trade a ""big swing-and-miss.""

Cleveland still owes Watson $46 million next season, and he has an $80.7 million cap for the 2026 season, the largest in the NFL.

The Browns have overhauled their quarterback room since Watson last stepped onto the field. Three different quarterbacks have started for the Browns this season: Joe Flacco and rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders.

Given Fred Warner’s Wolverine-like healing powers, where do you place the odds for him making a return to the lineup for the playoffs?
Here’s how I’d gauge his chances per round: Wild-card round: 16 percent Divisional round: 44 percent Championship round: 78 percent Super Bowl: just-try-and-stop-him percent What are your thoughts on Santa?","The San Francisco 49ers’ season has taken a pause, which gives us a chance to look ahead — to the final four games of the regular season, at a potential playoff berth and to what the team will do in free agency and the draft.

Thanks for all your thoughtful questions, which in some instances have been modified for length and clarity.

Do you think the Niners’ inexplicable injury epidemic might start to play into potential free agents’ minds before they come here? — Charles W.

Well, it’s interesting that the 49ers’ two lowest grades in the NFLPA’s annual report card were in the training room and training staff. They got B-minuses in those categories, though they ranked highly overall — eighth among the 32 teams.

That said, free agency is 90 percent about which team is offering the most money. And the next highest percentage is about finding an opportunity to make more money in the future. (For example, Sam Darnold and Mac Jones wanting to play in Kyle Shanahan’s system, thus making them more attractive to teams seeking a starting QB.)

I’d add that the Levi’s Stadium surface has ranked highly in player surveys in recent years. That’s gotta be a significant factor for free agents. For example, if Nick Bosa or George Kittle ever became free agents, I doubt they’d want to go to the Jets or Giants.

Does having Brandon Aiyuk’s guaranteed money off the books next year give the 49ers an opportunity for a splashy addition in the offseason? If so, what do you think the priority will be? — Iain D.

It looks like the 49ers will be in the middle of the pack when it comes to offseason salary-cap space (roughly $50 million) in 2026. If Aiyuk and pending free agents Jauan Jennings and Kendrick Bourne aren’t on the team, I’d imagine receiver will be a priority in free agency and the draft. The top returning options would be Ricky Pearsall, Demarcus Robinson, Jordan Watkins and Jacob Cowing. Three of those players have been injury-prone, while the fourth, Robinson, has just 13 catches in 10 games.

As far as flashy signings, I wonder whether Shanahan would be interested in Falcons tight end Kyle Pitts as someone who could step into the “big slot” role should Jennings move on. Shanahan had a similar player in Washington — and briefly with the 49ers — in Jordan Reed.

The 49ers’ plan depends on drafting stars along with solid players. Have they done that? Alfred Collins, maybe? Mykel Williams looks more solid than great. The strategy worked for the Rams because they got stars. Too early to say the 49ers have not? — Alex A.

Yes, I think it’s too early to say. Kittle wasn’t a star in Year 1, for example. Neither was the Rams’ Kyren Williams. Both took off in Year 2.

But I think it’s a legitimate question. The 49ers throw a lot of draft picks at wide receiver and the defensive line. As you note, they’ve found some solid players at those spots, but there’s been no indication yet that any go beyond “solid” when it comes to the past two drafts. As good as Collins has been, he still has no sacks and just four quarterback hits this season. Mykel Williams had one sack and three quarterback hits in nine games.

How do you think the Aiyuk situation, and to a lesser extent, Deebo Samuel’s negotiations and exit, will influence how the team approaches the position in the future, especially in regard to extensions? — Jeff S.

I wonder if the tactic will be:

Draft a wide receiver in the first round every two or three years so he’s under contract for four years with a fifth-year option.

Take advantage of the contract-year spike in performance that Aiyuk and Samuel had.

Resist rewarding that spike with a big contract. Either trade the player for a draft pick or let him sign elsewhere in free agency and perhaps get a compensatory pick the following year.

It’s never too early to look at next year’s draft. We all know the first-round pick will be a DL or maaaybe WR. But any early draft crushes for Rounds 2-5, i.e. the Oregon tight end that looks like Tony Gonzalez? Favorite deep positions? — Viktor A.

Confession: At this point in the year, I’ve really watched only one college team: UVA. But this is a good year to watch the Wahoos. An under-the-radar UVA guy I like is receiver Jahmal Edrine, who reminds me a lot of Jennings. He regularly serves pancakes and even got into a Jennings-like tussle in the back of the end zone with a frustrated Virginia Tech Hokie on Saturday. He might be someone the 49ers could land late — just like they did Jennings. Note: The 49ers had a strong scouting presence at the Florida State-UVA game in September.

As far as higher-round (but attainable) receivers, I really like Washington’s Denzel Boston and Louisville’s Chris Bell.

There were a lot of missed tackles against the Browns. Where do the Niners stand compared to the rest of the NFL? — Aurelien B.

Keeping in mind that four teams — 49ers, Giants, Panthers and Patriots — have played one more game than every other team, here’s how they rank in missed tackles, per Pro Football Focus:

Lions 71

Bears 73

Chiefs 79

Falcons 81

Titans 81

Browns 84

Packers 84

Patriots 84

Rams 86

Ravens 87

Buccaneers 90

Jaguars 91

Colts 96

Texans 96

Chargers 99

Broncos 103

Eagles 105

Commanders 108

Cowboys 108

Giants 108

Panthers 109

Dolphins 112

Seahawks 113

49ers 113

Jets 114

Saints 115

Steelers 115

Bengals 121

Raiders 122

Vikings 123

Cardinals 129

Watching Shadeur Sanders throw this week, it often felt like he had an age back there. How does the opposition time to throw look since Nick Bosa went down? — Niall M.

Your eyes weren’t deceiving you. Sanders’ average time to throw was 3.52 seconds, which is high. Still, only one other 49ers opponent — Matthew Stafford in Week 10 — has been above the 3-second mark since Bosa’s Week 3 injury.

When will the 49ers open Jacob Cowing’s practice window? — Josh S.

I spoke with Cowing about three weeks ago, and he said he was close to full speed/full health at that point. The problem is there’s no room for him on the roster at the moment. The 49ers already are making rookie Jordan Watkins a healthy scratch on game days.

The risk of opening Cowing’s window coming out of the bye would be that they’d have to activate him within 21 days or put him on the shelf for good. It might be wiser to wait and see if there are any more injuries at wide receiver and open the window at that point.

Is there a chance Nick Martin can take over for Luke Gifford? He is terrible in coverage. — Bill H.

In Gifford’s defense, he’s battling through a couple of injuries (I’m sure he’s been looking forward to the bye as much as anyone).

Second, he’s usually on the field because opponents are in their heavy personnel package. The Rams, for example, used a lot of three-tight end looks in their most recent matchup. The Browns used a lot of two-tight end sets with Harold Fannin Jr. and David Njoku. Gifford had problems when they passed out of those formations.

And third, I think the plan was to use Martin in that role Sunday, but Martin suffered a concussion in the first quarter. The 49ers went with Gifford and their big nickel package (Jason Pinnock) from that point forward.

Early in the season, Marques Sigle looked like maybe the steal of the 49ers’ draft class, a heat-seeking missile tackler and instrumental in key close-outs. I could understand Malik Mustapha winning back a starting role, but any insight into why Sigle suddenly dropped to apparent fourth on the safety depth chart? — Kieron S.

Here’s my stab: The 49ers feel like Mustapha and Ji’Ayir Brown are their best safety duo, which is something I questioned when they first started playing together, but which has borne out in the past two games as both, especially Mustapha, have gotten up to speed. (Is it possible the team knows more than me? Nah.)

As for Pinnock, I thought he struggled against the Panthers but was better against the Browns. The 49ers might like him over Sigle because he’s bigger and more experienced. He was also their rock at safety throughout the spring and summer. I wonder if his spot on the depth chart is partly a reward for that.

Now that Ben Bartch is out for the season, if Trent Williams were to miss a game, who would be the starting LT: Austen Pleasants or Spencer Burford (with Connor Colby filling in at LG)? — Allan B.

If it happened during a game, it would be Pleasants, who’s been practicing at left tackle and who’s been filling in at left tackle in garbage time in recent weeks. I think it would still be Pleasants if the team knew Williams would be out for an upcoming game, but it’s possible Burford would slide over from guard. The team also has Brandon Parker on the practice squad to be an emergency tackle in the second scenario.

Who replaces Kyle Juszczyk if he can’t come back from the rib fracture after the bye week? Jake Tonges? — Andy T.

Remember, Brock Purdy played on a short week (his second-ever) start after suffering a rib fracture (and after getting a pain blocker before the game). Obviously, they play dramatically different positions, but there’s a chance Juszczyk can go against the Titans.

If not, I think Tonges — who was in the backfield on six plays Sunday — would be the natural replacement. The team could also elevate Brayden Willis from the practice squad.

If the 49ers were to finish third in the division this year, what other third-place team would they face in 2026? — David H.

They’re scheduled to host teams from the AFC East and NFC North and to visit a team in the NFC South. Right now, the third-place teams in those divisions are the Dolphins, Lions and Falcons.

Every year, Kyle Shanahan is on the short list of best NFL coaches. Most consider this his finest coaching season. How is he not Coach of the Year? — Jason M.

I agree this is his finest year (though 2021 was pretty impressive, too). But there’s too much nuance for voters to take into account when it comes to San Francisco’s season. More obvious turnarounds like Mike Vrabel’s in New England or Ben Johnson’s in Chicago are far easier to comprehend. It’s hard to see Shanahan getting that honor.

Several teams will be calling the 49ers to trade for Mac Jones. What do you think the 49ers could realistically get back in compensation for him? —Jeffrey W.

The last time I answered this, I said a second-rounder and was tarred and feathered online. (I’ve been watching Ken Burns’ “The American Revolution” documentary.) So I’m changing my answer to a third-rounder with a seventh-rounder thrown in.

​​Do you think Jim Schwartz would be a top target as DC if the Browns’ staff gets let go and Robert Saleh becomes a head coach? — Mike D.

It’s a good call. Shanahan obviously has a ton of respect for Schwartz, and the two had a warm exchange at midfield after Sunday’s game. I will note, however, that Gus Bradley is also a possible Saleh replacement, and he’s already on staff.

What exactly do injured players do when they are working on the dreaded side field? Thanks! — Joe M.

Ha! Sometimes the side field is more crowded than the practice field. (Not really, but you get the joke.) It’s a gradual procession, one that begins with straight-line jogging, then eventually builds to making full-speed cuts between cones. Last week, I saw Cowing sprinting with a parachute on his back.

Given Fred Warner’s Wolverine-like healing powers, where do you place the odds for him making a return to the lineup for the playoffs? 50/50? — Angel A.

Well, it might depend on how far the 49ers go in the playoffs. When I spoke to orthopedic surgeons about the timeline, they said 16 weeks was normal for athletes with Warner’s injury, but that there were all sorts of variables — good and bad. Warner broke his ankle on Oct. 12, so the wild-card round (Jan. 10-12) would be 13 weeks since the injury.

Here’s how I’d gauge his chances per round:

Wild-card round: 16 percent

Divisional round: 44 percent

Championship round: 78 percent

Super Bowl: just-try-and-stop-him percent

Watson has 21 days to practice or he will remain on injured reserve for the rest of the season.

Watson suffered a setback in January that required a second surgery and extended his timeline for a return to the field. However, he is now set to begin ramping up his on-field workload. It's not clear what the timeline is for a potential return to actual game action for Watson. The Browns have five games left in this regular season and it's at least possible Watson gets a chance to take some snaps before the end of the year.

It has been a wild season at the quarterback position in Cleveland, starting with the NFL Draft when they selected Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders in the third and fifth rounds, respectively. Those rookies joined a crowded QB room with Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco. The Browns traded Pickett before the start of the season to the Raiders for a fifth-round pick.

Flacco began the year as the starter where he went 1-3 and was benched in favor of Gabriel. He was then traded to the rival Bengals. Gabriel went 1-5 in six starts before suffering a concussion that thrust Sanders into action. Sanders struggled in his first action, but he picked up a win in his first start against the Raiders before then losing to the 49ers last week.

Now, Watson's potential return to practice adds another layer to what has already been one of the league's most dramatic quarterback rooms.

Watson has one more year remaining on his infamous, fully guaranteed $230 million contract for 2026. Watson arrived in Cleveland embroiled in controversy as he faced lawsuits alleging sexual misconduct from nearly two dozen massage therapists. Most of those lawsuits have been settled and he served an 11-game suspension from the NFL in his first season in Cleveland.

Watson has played in just 19 games over four seasons with the Browns due to that suspension and various injuries. When he has played, his performance has been a disappointment, completing 61.2% of his passes for 3,365 yards, 19 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/03/a99b071f-c2ee-4a10-b4da-1b8e3f0fd363/thumbnail/1200x675/5378bdf29ffa37e1b31859dacca19b20/deshaun-watson.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 13:04:29.201821

Two of the Pats’ most important players, defensive tackle Milton Williams and left tackle Will Campbell, find themselves on injured reserve currently, which has forced Mike Vrabel and the coaching staff to get creative when it comes to filling out the depth chart.

If you ask NFL insider Jeremy Fowler, he believes that these injuries could cause problems for New England moving forward, especially with a pair of difficult games on the horizon.

“The Patriots have injuries to two key players — defensive tackle Milton Williams (high ankle sprain) and rookie left tackle Will Campbell (knee sprain) — that loom large,” Fowler wrote for ESPN.

“Williams has validated his massive free agent contract with impressive play, and Campbell has ferociously protected Drake Maye’s blind side. Both should be back before the playoffs, but how New England holds up in the meantime bears watching.”

Evans, 32, was out to a bit of a slow start prior to the injury. In four games, the veteran had 14 catches for 140 yards and a touchdown. His season was disrupted by a hamstring injury in Week 3, which sidelined the veteran for three games before he returned to action in Week 7.

His return was short-lived. Evans sustained a concussion and a broken clavicle during the team's 24-9 loss to the Detroit Lions in Week 7. Evans was injured trying to make a difficult catch on a deep ball. He was hit as he tried to haul in the ball and landed hard on his shoulder and head.

Evans remained down on the field after the play, though eventually walked off with the help of trainers. He was eventually carted to the locker room, where he was later ruled out for the rest of the game.

The injury ended Evans' chance at gaining at least 1,000 receiving yards for the 12th straight season. The veteran crossed that threshold every single season in his career prior to 2025.

While 1,000 yards is out of the question, Evans and the Bucs have plenty to play for down the stretch. The team currently leads the NFC South, though the Carolina Panthers aren't far behind. The two teams have yet to play each other and having Evans for those contests could make a big difference as the regular season comes to a close.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nJGBXkj1V8iFd16sFCDm_w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/36d236c0-d051-11f0-b75e-5e4305fc4a4e,N,,2025-12-03 13:04:33.802448

Tampa Bay is opening the 21-day practice window for star wide receiver Mike Evans as well as second-year wide receiver Jalen McMillan, CBS Sports lead NFL insider Jonathan Jones reports.

Evans, 32, broke his collarbone and suffered a concussion in Week 7 against the Lions, landing hard after nearly reeling in a deep pass from Baker Mayfield. That had been Evans' first game back since Week 3, when he suffered a hamstring injury. Coach Todd Bowles said after the Lions game that the collarbone injury would keep Evans ""out mostly toward the end of the year.""

Overall this season, Evans has 14 catches for 140 yards and one touchdown, so while his record-tying streak of 11 straight 1,000-yard receiving seasons is over, the fact that he's potentially returning on the earlier side of the timeline set by Bowles is a very good sign for Tampa Bay.

McMillan, 23, reeled in 37 catches for 461 yards and eight scores last season as a third-round rookie out of Washington; the eight touchdown catches were third-most by a rookie in franchise history. Expected to open the season as a starter, McMillan landed awkwardly after trying to catch a high throw in the preseason and suffered a ""severely sprained neck"" that had him in a brace for several months.

Jones noted that both players will ""take some time getting back on the game field,"" so while a return to the lineup may not be imminent, this is a key step forward.

Buccaneers finally getting healthy

Tampa Bay has battled a litany of injuries this season. Star left tackle Tristan Wirfs underwent knee surgery shortly before the regular season began and missed the first three games of the season. Likewise, wide receiver Chris Godwin, recovering from a severe leg/ankle injury last season, did not debut until Week 4. Godwin then missed Weeks 6-11 with a fibula injury. Bucky Irving played for the first time since Week 4 last week due to foot and shoulder injuries.

Right tackle Luke Goedeke has played in just six games due to a foot injury and aggravation, though he has been back for the last four games. Right guard Cody Mauch suffered a season-ending knee injury in Week 2.

Despite that, Tampa Bay is 7-5 and atop the NFC South. Mayfield has thrown for 2,600 yards, 19 touchdowns and five interceptions and run for 246 yards. Rachaad White and Sean Tucker have played well in Irving's absence, and standout first-round rookie Emeka Egbuka has shined with 791 receiving yards and six touchdowns. He and seventh-round rookie Tez Johnson (five touchdowns) have been on the receiving end of more than half of Mayfield's touchdowns.

Tampa Bay is yet to play a snap this season with its top three wide receivers -- Evans, Egbuka and Godwin -- on the field together.

Playoff impact

The Buccaneers have a half-game lead on the Panthers (7-6) for the NFC South lead; SportsLine currently gives Tampa Bay an 85% chance to win the division and an 86% chance to make the playoffs.

Let’s walk through all of the major injury news that fantasy football managers need to know heading into Week 14.

ForbesWeek 14 Fantasy Football Start ’Em Sit ’Em: Travis Etienne, DeVonta Smith And More

Notable Injuries

1. Amon-Ra St. Brown, Detroit Lions WR (ankle)

Amon-Ra St. Brown's fantasy managers didn't have much to be thankful for on Thanksgiving this year. He suffered an ankle injury midway through the first quarter of the Lions' loss to the Green Bay Packers and did not return, which left him scoreless on the day.

After the game, Lions head coach Dan Campbell told reporters that he didn't think St. Brown's injury would be ""long, long term,"" but he might miss a week or two. The Lions play Thursday against this Dallas Cowboys this week, which gives St. Brown three fewer days to recover than he'd typically have.

If St. Brown sits Thursday, the Lions’ passing game figures to flow through Jameson Williams and Jahmyr Gibbs. Williams erupted with seven catches for a season-high 144 yards and a touchdown against the Packers in St. Brown's absence and should be locked into fantasy lineups this week as well. Rookie wideout Isaac TeSlaa could be an intriguing flier for those in deep leagues, too.

2. Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Clippers QB (hand)

Justin Herbert suffered a fractured bone in his left (non-throwing) hand early in the first quarter of the Chargers' win over the Las Vegas Raiders on Sunday, although he was able to return to the game after getting fitted with a hard cast and glove. He underwent surgery Monday and is considered day-to-day, per ESPN's Kris Rhim.

After the game Sunday, Herbert told reporters that he expected to be fine for the Chargers' Week 14 game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday Night Football. However, he did say that he had trouble holding onto the ball after the injury, so Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh plans to prepare backup quarterback Trey Lance ""for under-center goal-line scenarios"" this week, according to Rhim.

Herbert hasn’t been putting up big numbers in recent weeks even prior to the injury, so fantasy managers might want to consider their alternatives even if he is able to suit up. Lance would be a break-glass-in-case-of-emergency starter only against the Eagles' typically stout defense.

3. Aaron Jones, Minnesota Vikings RB (shoulder)

Aaron Jones has been nursing an AC joint sprain in his shoulder for the past month and aggravated it Sunday in the Vikings' blowout loss to the Seattle Seahawks. He left midway through the third quarter and did not return.

On Monday, Vikings head coach Kevin O'Connell told reporters that Jones did ""not seem to have made it any worse for the wear, but he'll be day-to-day."" It's unclear if he'll be able to suit up in the Vikings' Week 14 game against the Washington Commanders on Sunday.

If Jones can’t go, Jordan Mason figures to lead the Vikings' backfield committee once again. He had six carries for 47 yards against Seattle in Jones' absence, although he'll have a relatively low ceiling given the current state of the Vikings' offense. He's still worth picking up if he's available anywhere on waivers, though.

4. Marvin Harrison Jr., Arizona Cardinals WR (heel)

Marvin Harrison Jr. made his return Sunday after a two-game absence due to appendicitis, but he didn't emerge from the game unscathed. He suffered a right heel injury against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the second half and missed most of the fourth quarter.

On Monday, head coach Jonathan Gannon told reporters that Harrison is continuing to be evaluated and that the Cardinals will have an update on his status later in the week. During a local radio appearance, he compared it to the heel injury that sidelined cornerback Max Melton this past week, which might not bode well for Harrison's chances of suiting up Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams.

If Harrison can’t play in Week 14, Michael Wilson will go right back to being the Cardinals' WR1. He caught 25 passes on 33 targets for 303 yards during the two weeks Harrison missed, so he should be locked into all fantasy lineups this week. Greg Dortch, who caught 12 passes on 15 targets for 119 yards and two touchdowns, is also worth a speculative pickup, particularly in deeper leagues.

5. Tyrone Tracy Jr., New York Giants RB (hip)

In the fourth quarter of the Giants' loss to the New England Patriots on Monday Night Football, Tyrone Tracy Jr. suffered a hip injury that required him to get carted off the field. In his absence, veteran tailback Devin Singletary stepped in as the Giants' every-down running back.

Tracy told reporters Tuesday that he suffered a hip contusion/stinger and he’s fine, according to Dan Duggan of The Athletic. The Giants are on bye in Week 14, but it sounds as though he should be back in action in Week 15.

With that said, fantasy managers who have already locked up a playoff spot or those with an open spot on their bench should consider scooping up Singletary in leagues where he’s available. With Cam Skattebo done for the year, Singletary is the only other running back on the Giants’ roster who's had a single carry this year.

Quick Hits

1. Dylan Sampson, Cleveland Browns RB (calf)

Dylan Sampson left Sunday’s loss to the San Francisco 49ers with a calf injury, although head coach Kevin Stefanski told reporters Monday that he's day-to-day. If he can't suit up for the Browns' game against the Tennessee Titans in Week 14, Jerome Ford figures to back up starting running back Quinshon Judkins, but he wouldn't be worth starting in any leagues.

2. Parker Washington, Jacksonville Jaguars WR (hip)

Parker Washington suffered a hip injury in the first half of Sunday’s blowout win over the Titans and could not return. In his absence, Jakobi Meyers hauled in a team-high six catches for 90 yards and a touchdown, while Brian Thomas Jr. mustered only two catches for 28 yards. Meyers would be a must-start, but Thomas would only be a desperation play. Tight end Brenton Strange (three catches for 45 yards and a touchdown) could be worth a flier for managers looking to replace George Kittle (bye) this week.

3. Kyle Juszczyk, San Francisco 49ers FB (ribs)

Kyle Juszczyk isn’t a fantasy factor whatsoever, but he's key to the Niners' running game. He suffered a rib fracture in their win over the Browns and is set to be re-evaluated after their Week 14 bye. If he's forced to miss time, it could further decrease Christian McCaffrey's effectiveness on the ground, although he's still a locked-in starter due to his robust work as a pass-catcher.

Potential Returns

1. Tee Higgins, Cincinnati Bengals WR (concussion)

Tee Higgins missed the Bengals’ blowout win over the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion, and head coach Zac Taylor told reporters Monday that he's still in the NFL's concussion protocol. However, he was in uniform Monday for the Bengals' walkthrough, so there's a decent chance he'll be cleared before Sunday's pivotal game against the Buffalo Bills.

2. Omarion Hampton, Los Angeles Chargers RB (ankle)

Omarion Hampton was a limited participant in practice last week before he got ruled out for the Chargers’ win over the Raiders. On Monday, CBS Sports' Matt Zenitz reported that ""there's optimism entering the week"" that Hampton will return from his seven-game absence to face the Eagles on Monday. With Herbert banged up, the Chargers may look to lean on their running game with Hampton and Kimani Vidal.

3. Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders QB (elbow)

Jayden Daniels was also a limited participant in practice last week before he was ruled out against the Denver Broncos on Sunday due to the elbow injury that has sidelined him since Week 9. Head coach Dan Quinn told reporters Monday that Daniels still has yet to be cleared for contact, although there’s a chance he returns for Sunday's game against the Vikings. Why the Commanders would risk their franchise quarterback in a year where they're effectively eliminated from the playoffs is anyone's guess, but make sure Daniels isn't available on your waivers just in case.

4. J.J. McCarthy, Minnesota Vikings QB (concussion)

J.J. McCarthy missed the Vikings’ blowout loss to the Seahawks with a concussion, but O'Connell told reporters after the game that he could be cleared from the league's concussion protocol as soon as Monday. The Vikings will go back to him as their starter if he does clear the protocol, although given his ineffectiveness in recent weeks, it'll be hard to start any Vikings skill-position player with confidence either way.

5. Jayden Reed and Matthew Golden, Green Bay Packers WRs (foot/collarbone, wrist)

The Packers’ receiving corps might get even more unpredictable this week, as head coach Matt LaFleur told reporters Monday that both Jayden Reed and Matthew Golden could return. Dontayvion Wicks erupted with six catches for 94 yards and two touchdowns in their absence against the Lions on Sunday, but Christian Watson might be the Packers receiver with the best combination of floor and ceiling.

The beginning of this knee injury is unclear.
Since after the Lions’ Week 4 game against the Cleveland Browns, he’s been listed with a knee injury every week on the injury report.","It’s been a rough season for Detroit Lions safety Kerby Joseph. After a strong start—nabbing three interceptions in the first six games of the season—Joseph has been sidelined with a knee injury for the past six contests. The Lions have not placed him on injured reserve, yet he hasn’t practiced, and the only updates we’ve been regularly getting is that he’s improving.

Things came to a head this week when Joseph went on social media, posted a couple of concerning messages (“God help me,” “I’m lost 4 words”) before deleting his social media accounts completely.

Afterwards, we got a little bit of clarity from coach Dan Campbell and Joseph himself via a pair of media sessions. So let’s break it all down.

Note: We will not be using any speculation on his injury from internet doctors who are guessing diagnoses based on video and comments. I understand the value of those expert opinions, but I would rather deal in hard facts for this post.

What is Kerby Joseph’s injury?

While there is no direct diagnosis of Joseph’s injury, we know that it is a knee injury that includes a bone bruise. Here’s what Campbell said this week about the specifics of the injury.

“I think bone bruise was certainly part of it, but it’s also just–he’s got some wear. He’s got a little wear, that’s all.

The beginning of this knee injury is unclear. He missed some time in training camp. Here’s what Campbell said about it then (August 18):

“Yeah, it’s something he’s been dealing with a little bit. So, he won’t be out there today. We’re hoping to get him back late in the week, that’s the hope right now. We don’t feel like it’s a major problem, it’s just something we’re trying to manage right now and get it calmed down.”

Joseph would eventually return to practice and was off the injury report for Week 1. However, he was back on it for Weeks 2 and 3, before being off it again in Week 4.

Since after the Lions’ Week 4 game against the Cleveland Browns, he’s been listed with a knee injury every week on the injury report. He played with that injury for two more games (Bengals, Chiefs) before being sidelined for the next six. In the Browns and Chiefs game, Joseph left temporarily, only to return later.

What is the hold up in his recovery?

Per Campbell, the concern is stability in his leg. In order for them to feel comfortable with him playing, they need to build up strength around it.

“A lot of it is just trying to get some stability in the leg. Get some strength, get some stability, which in turn will help some of the pain but also some of the wear and tear,” Campbell said. “The stronger you get it in there, it stabilizes it, so it doesn’t wear out as fast or create that kind of pain with it.”

Why the Lions didn’t put Joseph on injured reserve is unclear, but it’s certainly possible they didn’t expect the recovery to take long. And it’s also possible the Lions wanted to conserve IR-to-return spots, the maximum of which is eight per season.

One thing is for certain, though, the Lions believe Joseph is doing all he physically can to get back out there.

“I know it can be frustrating when you get hurt, especially when you’ve been trying to work your way back. And he’s been busting his tail to get back,” Campbell said.

Is this an injury that will affect his entire career?

This is where we have some conflicting information.

On Monday, Campbell indicated this is an injury that may never completely go away.

“I don’t think it’s necessarily going away, but I think you do the best you can to manage it,” Campbell said. “It’s like a lot of these guys, you know that they’ve got some injuries here or dealing with cartilage or meniscus or anything like that, you do your best to manage it. There’ll always be a little wear and tear, it’s just how bad is it.”

Joseph, himself, seemed to mostly corroborate this. In a short, somber media session on Monday, here’s how he answered some questions from reporters:

Reporter: “What can you add to [your social media posts] in terms of diagnosis?

Joseph: “My knee’s messed up.”

Reporter: “How do you fix it at this point?”

Joseph: “You don’t fix it. Just keep your faith.”

Reporter: “Surgery in the offseason or something like that? Is something like that possible?”

Joseph: “Nuh-uh”

Later, he was asked about how concerned he was that the injury would impact his long-term NFL career. His answer: “Got to trust in God’s plan. Put it in God’s hands.”

But a Tuesday report from NFL insider Jordan Schultz paints a brighter future for Joseph, including a potential offseason treatment that could help. Here’s the entirety of Schultz’s tweet:

#Lions All-Pro safety Kerby Joseph has been dealing with a nagging knee injury which has kept him out of the lineup, but he intends to return to the field this season, and this injury is not considered career-altering, as some have speculated, per multiple sources.

Joseph will likely seek treatment for the knee in the offseason, but he plans to be on the field in the coming weeks.

When will Joseph play again?

It seems relatively soon. Joseph returned to practice on Monday sporting a pretty hefty brace on his left leg, and he was moving around pretty well.

That said, he was constantly fidgeting with the brace, and he did not practice on Tuesday. Campbell was quick to point out this wasn’t necessarily a setback in Joseph’s recovery.

“He’s been rehabbing, he’s been doing things on the side, but that’s kind of his first being around it in the individual drills. And so, sometimes you’re always going to hope for a little bit more than the first time you get back on the turf, but that doesn’t mean this is a setback,” Campbell said prior to Tuesday’s practice.

The Lions play the Cowboys on Thursday, which seems possibly too early for Joseph’s return given he’s only had one practice with the brace. But with the Lions having a mini-bye before their Week 15 games against the Rams, that seems like a more realistic goal.",https://platform.prideofdetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/127/2025/12/gettyimages-2237913338.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.727691529249%2C100%2C78.544616941502&w=1200,N,,2025-12-03 15:05:36.994578

Indianapolis had the best record in the NFL after eight weeks (7-1), its offense was sizzling, and hopes of a deep playoff run were more than justified. It felt like a throwback to the Peyton Manning era, when the Colts were annually in contention for a Super Bowl run.

One month later, the Colts are reeling, losing three of four games. Their offense has come back to earth, and the playoffs are no longer a sure thing.

The Colts (8-4) find themselves in a tie with the Jacksonville Jaguars for the AFC South lead as their multigame advantage in the standings has been erased. And the Colts' final stretch run includes two games against Jacksonville, a road game at Seattle and another meeting with Houston, which beat the Colts on Sunday. This Sunday's game at Jacksonville poses a major test for Indianapolis, which hasn't won there since 2014.

Here's a closer look at some of the issues that have led to the Colts' recent struggles.

First-down production

One of the keys to the Colts' early offensive dominance was their prolific production on first downs. The Colts were averaging 7.2 yards per play on first downs through Week 8 but are mustering just 6 yards per play since. That was a historic pace for Indianapolis. To put it in context, in the past 15 seasons, only the 2016 Atlanta Falcons, who reached the Super Bowl that season, produced more yards per play on first downs (7.6).

Why does this matter? It's directly responsible for the Colts' long down-and-distance situations in recent weeks, which has led to more failed drives and punts.

""Those third-and-long conversions, they come and go,"" receiver Josh Downs said. ""They're not statistically high-percentage, so you've just got to try to stay on schedule.""

The Colts were 3-for-10 on third downs and 0-for-2 on fourth downs in Sunday's loss to the Texans.

Daniel Jones' injury

There's no way around it: Daniel Jones' fibula injury has placed limits on the Colts' offense.

Jones has been a limited practice participant multiple times in the past two weeks but hasn't missed any games. But make no mistake: He's playing hurt.

That's not to say Jones has played poorly. He completed 14 of 27 passes for 201 yards and two touchdowns in Sunday's loss. But the injury is limiting his mobility which in turn limits what plays the Colts can call. With run-pass options and bootleg throws being a big part of the Colts' usual game plans, it's likely that Jones' injury has impacted coach Shane Steichen's playcalling.

Jones attempted just one pass outside the pocket in Sunday's game, rolling out and hitting tight end Tyler Warren for a 12-yard touchdown.

Defensive injuries

The loss of defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, who remains on injured reserve with a neck injury, has been difficult to overcome.

The Colts have made significant draft and financial investments in their defensive line, but with players such as Laiatu Latu creating pressure but not always closing the deal with sacks, the Colts have struggled to replace Buckner's interior disruption.

The Colts expect Buckner back before the end of the season, but he must miss at least one more game.

The Buckner injury is compounded by the loss of star cornerback Sauce Gardner with a calf injury in Sunday's game. Gardner did not suffer an Achilles injury, which was initially feared. But he will still miss an undetermined amount of time in the lineup, Steichen said Monday.

The effect of Gardner's injury was immediately evident: The Colts had intended to use Gardner and fellow perimeter cornerback Charvarius Ward in static right and left roles, respectively. But after Gardner left Sunday's game, defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo immediately altered Ward's role, assigning him the job of tracking Texans No. 1 receiver Nico Collins throughout the game. That's likely to continue against top receivers, and it's a much heavier workload than the Colts envisioned.

Jonathan Taylor's slump

League rushing leader Jonathan Taylor was fueling talk of a run at Most Valuable Player after his stunning 244-yard performance in Week 10 against the Falcons. But in the two games since, Taylor has rushed a combined 37 times for 143 yards. That's a 3.9-yard-per-carry average, far lower than Taylor's 5.7-yard average for the season.

So, what's at play here? There's no singular answer. Some of it is consecutive matchups against two of the NFL's top defenses -- the Chiefs and Texans. Then, there's the lack of success on early downs, which has forced the Colts into more passing situations and made them more predictable.

There's an argument to be made that Taylor needs more touches since many of his most impactful plays have happened late in games. But until the Colts are able to sustain drives, it might not matter.

Kicking questions

The Colts lost kicker Spencer Shrader to a season-ending injury after a collision with a defender in Week 5, sidelining the league's leading kicker at the time.

In the seven games since, his replacement -- Michael Badgley -- missed three extra points, including one in Sunday's loss to the Texans that left Indianapolis with a four-point deficit instead of three points on its final possession.

The Colts released Badgley on Monday and signed former Saints kicker Blake Grupe.

The loss of Shrader had a clear impact on Steichen's in-game decision-making because Badgley had less range. That means Steichen has had to attempt some difficult fourth downs that he wasn't entirely comfortable with because the alternative of attempting a field goal wasn't seen as a good option.

Badgley was converting 43.8% on attempts of 50 yards or longer. The league average is 68.1%.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1130%2Fr1582917_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 09:59:49.634602

With Cincinnati on a short week for Thanksgiving, Higgins wasn’t able to clear concussion protocol and had to miss this year’s Thanksgiving win vs. the Ravens, 32-14.

The win was their biggest of the season, 32-14, as Bengals QB Joe Burrow’s return stabilized the offense. Burrow lled eight scoring drives and finished with 261 passing yards and 2 TDs.

This week, the Bengals could get Tee Higgins back in the lineup as they make one last playoff push. With that said, let’s get the latest Tee Higgins’ injury update to see if he'll play this week, and look at the stats and PrizePicks projections for the rest of the Bengals’ offense, including WR Ja’Marr Chase.

{{core_offer_banner=""/style-system/ui-components-playbook""}}

Tee Higgins Injury Status: Will Higgins Play This Week vs. Bills?

As of Monday, Tee Higgins remains in the concussion protocol but is progressing. Head coach Zac Taylor stated that Higgins is “doing well” and is in “great spirits” as he works through protocol. The Bengals play the Bills on Sunday at 1 p.m. ET.

The veteran wideout has a couple more days to clear the protocol and get ready for a big-time matchup against the Bills on Sunday. With a must-win game looming to keep the Bengals alive, Higgins will push to be available and help Cincinnati chase a Week 14 win.

Bengals Fantasy Football Outlook if Tee Higgins is Out Week 14

On Thanksgiving, Chase returned from a one-game suspension for spitting on Steelers CB Jalen Ramsey. He led the team catching 7-of-14 targets for 110 yards vs. the Ravens. It was WR Mitchell Tinsley and RB Chase Brown who emerged as Burrow’s favorite targets aside from Chase, combining for 16 targets.

If Higgins remains out for this critical matchup against the Bills on Sunday, the Bengals’ WR depth chart would likely look like this:

WR1 - Ja’Marr Chase

WR2 - Mitchell Tinsley

WR3 - Andrei Iosivas

WR4 - Charlie Jones

With Higgins still questionable for Sunday, Cincinnati would continue to feature Chase as the clear focal point of the passing game if he not cleared. In 14 games without Higgins in the lineup, Chase has averaged 6.1 receptions, 83.1 yards, and 0.8 TDs per game.

The Colts, his Week 14 opponent, have allowed the fifth-most fantasy PPG to tight ends this season.
That is especially true for Dontayvion Wicks, who popped up with 28 fantasy points on Thanksgiving.","Takeaways:

With the 49ers on bye, there's no Christian McCaffrey in the final week of the fantasy regular season (something I'm dealing with in my League of Record). That means many of us are going to be scrambling and making starts that we really would have liked to avoid. Looking at you, Chris Rodriguez Jr. Hopefully you have already locked up a playoff spot (I have) or a first-round bye (I have not), so good luck to all of you as you make your way through this ill-timed bye week.

George Pickens has scored 29-plus fantasy points four times this season. In Week 14 he faces the Lions, who have allowed the fourth-most fantasy PPG to wide receivers this year. Weird, I'm pretty sure nobody brought that up when the Packers had a great game against Detroit on Thanksgiving. Then again, nobody tries to discredit the Packers' wins. That's all saved for the Bears, Patriots and Broncos, right?

Jaxon Smith-Njigba is human. He was held to fewer than 13 fantasy points for the first time this season. You all need to chill on this man. He's going to be just fine.

Derrick Henry has four rushing touchdowns in his last three games, and I love the Ravens to bounce back this week against the Steelers. It's too little, too late for my Lamar Jackson shares. But Henry should be good.

James Cook had 35 touches in Week 13, which is incredible to think about. He might score 100 points if he gets that kind of volume against the Bengals, who have given up the most fantasy PPG to running backs this season.

Chase Brown leads the Bengals in targets (33) and receptions (23) since Week 9. I figured it would be a guy named Chase leading Cincinnati in those categories. Just not that Chase.

Jaylen Waddle has been a disappointment for fantasy managers of late (15.2 points in last two games combined). There's reason for optimism, though. The Dolphins' opponents during the fantasy playoffs include some of the most generous pass defenses out there (Steelers, Bengals, Buccaneers).

RJ Harvey has scored at least 16 fantasy points in three of his last five games. He's played 53 percent of the Broncos' offensive snaps in the two games since J.K. Dobbins suffered a season-ending injury. The Raiders, Denver's Week 14 opponent, have allowed the 11th-most fantasy PPG to running backs this season. It's been a rough year for Las Vegas. I'm curious to see what decisions are made after the season. It seems likely that the Raiders will draft a quarterback. Will Pete Carroll be back? Sorry, didn't mean to bring in a real football discussion here.

Blake Corum is starting to come alive for the Rams. He's played 33 percent of the offensive snaps since Week 7 and scored a season-high 14.1 fantasy points on Sunday. Kyren Williams has been dinged up, and the Rams are playing for the playoffs. No, not your fantasy playoffs (rude).

Takeaways:

Adonai Mitchell had a breakout game against the Falcons, who have one of the league's best pass defenses (at least statistically) this season. Mitchell has a 29.8 percent target share since making his Jets debut in Week 11, sixth-highest in the league over that span. Also, he has a league-leading 60.5 percent air yards share with 458 during that stretch, a leading indicator for future success.

I can't believe I'm writing this, but Kyle Pitts has 10 games with at least five targets this season.

Brenton Strange has scored at least 10 fantasy points in four of his last five games. The Colts, his Week 14 opponent, have allowed the fifth-most fantasy PPG to tight ends this season.

Devaughn Vele has been targeted 15 times in the last two weeks and was the fantasy WR7 in Week 13 (8 catches for 93 yards, TD). This week he'll face the Buccaneers, who have allowed the sixth-most receptions to wide receivers.

I'm having a tough time trusting any Packers wide receivers this week. That is especially true for Dontayvion Wicks, who popped up with 28 fantasy points on Thanksgiving. It was the first time he scored more than nine points in a game all season.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/vtauodbiqngkk1gadhzj,N,,2025-12-03 10:00:00.703629

Washington was a critical part of Baltimore's defensive turnaround last season when he was inserted into the starting lineup.","The Ravens got two key defenders back on the field Tuesday, as outside linebacker Tavius Robinson and safety Ar'Darius Washington returned to practice.

They'll begin ramping back up as the Ravens (6-6) head into a five-game December/January stretch that will determine whether they win the AFC North crown for a third straight year and reach the postseason.

Robinson, who has been designated for return and his 21-day window opened, has been sidelined since suffering a foot injury in the Ravens' Week 6 game against the Los Angeles Rams. He had never missed a game, or even a practice, to that point in his career.

A rugged defender against the run who had two sacks and 17 tackles in the Ravens' first six games this season, Robinson's return will strengthen Baltimore's defensive front.

His departure meant more snaps for rookie Mike Green and David Ojabo. The Ravens also traded for Dre'Mont Jones a few weeks after Robinson went down, and last week leaned on practice squad veteran Carl Lawson.

Washington was a critical part of Baltimore's defensive turnaround last season when he was inserted into the starting lineup. Even though the Ravens drafted safety Malaki Starks in the first round, Washington was still poised to play a big role in Baltimore's secondary this season before suffering an Achilles tear in May, which sent him to the Reserve/Physically Unable to Perform list.

His absence forced Kyle Hamilton to play in a more traditional role earlier this season and ultimately led to the Ravens trading for Alohi Gilman. That moved Hamilton back closer to the line of scrimmage, which has had a positive ripple effect on the rest of the defense.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/ravens/w4irjaconr0x9eca0gff,N,,2025-12-03 13:04:44.604115

Insiders Jeremy Fowler and Dan Graziano have been calling sources around the league for the latest news and buzz on key situations -- including some nuggets that might matter for fantasy football.

This week, they have the newest intel on two quarterbacks: Carolina's Bryce Young and Cleveland's Shedeur Sanders. Young is extension-eligible this offseason, and the Panthers also have a decision to make on his fifth-year option. Has he played his way all the way back from a 2024 benching into a new contract with Carolina? And what are people around the league saying about Sanders, now that the 2025 fifth-round pick has two starts under his belt? Has he shown any signs of being the future for the Browns?

But first, we have the latest buzz around the NFL on tight division races and key injuries. Which divisions could come down to the wire? And which injuries might affect those races? It's all here, as our national reporters answer big questions and empty their notebooks heading into Week 14.

Jump to:br/>Tight division races | Key injury updatesbr/>Young's next deal | Sanders' future

Which division race is getting the most buzz around the league?

Graziano: Does anybody want to win the AFC North? The Steelers started hot but have lost five of their past seven to drop to 6-6. The Ravens won five in a row to recover from a tough start and get to 6-5 but lost to the Bengals last week and are now tied with the Steelers for first place. The Bengals, with Joe Burrow back from his injury, are 4-8 and only two games out of first place with another gameagainst the Ravensstill to come.

The Steelers and Ravens have two games left to play against each other, starting with Sunday's meeting in Baltimore, so those head-to-head matchups could settle things, but it's possible they won't. Baltimore and Pittsburgh haven't looked very good lately, and there are those who wonder whether the Bengals can steal the division with a hot finish. The sentiment I get is that the Bengals' chances would look a lot better if they had simply held one of the fourth-quarter leads they had against the Jets or the Bears.

At this point, it seems anything is possible in the AFC North, where no one currently has a winning record. It has led some to wonder whether a team can win the division with nine or even eight wins.

Fowler: The tension is also palpable in the AFC South, one of two divisions featuring three teams with at least seven wins (the NFC West is the other). It's particularly thick in Indianapolis, which is coming off back-to-back losses and faces a unrelenting finishing stretch. The teams left on the Colts' schedule have a combined record of 33-15. Among those games is two meetings vs. Jacksonville, which is tied with the Colts at 8-4 but holds the tiebreaker because of its record against common opponents.

The Colts were looking forward to this difficult stretch, which started with a Week 12 loss to the Chiefs, believing it would test their January football mettle. How they play over the next month will be closely watched by many in the league. The Colts have lost three of their past four games, quarterback Daniel Jones is noticeably hobbled, and cornerback Sauce Gardner is probably out multiple weeks because of a calf injury. Meanwhile, Jacksonville keeps finding a way to win without a dominant passing attack, while Houston's defense can hang with anybody. All of this deepens the intrigue of a normally overlooked division.

Graziano: Since you mentioned the NFC West, I'll dive in there. It's possible the two best NFC teams play in the West, and when the Rams and Seahawks met earlier this season, the Rams prevailed, but only after a missed last-second field goal attempt. The rematch inWeek 16 in Seattlecould decide the division champ, as both teams are 9-3. But the injury-riddled 49ers miraculously sit a half-game behind them at 9-4 heading into their bye week.

This is an outstanding three-way race that could still tip San Francisco's way if the Rams and Seahawks slip up slightly. The Niners have benefited from a bit of a soft schedule, and they emerge from the bye with a Week 15 matchup against the woebegone Titans. But they finish with games against the Colts, Bears and Seahawks, each of whom occupies at least a share of first place in their respective divisions. The Rams still have two games against the 3-9 Cardinals along with a trip to Atlanta, but their toughest non-Seattle game takes place at home against the Lions in Week 15. The Seahawks have road games left in Atlanta, Carolina and San Francisco to go with home games against the Colts and Rams.

Fowler: All three of those NFC West teams are a problem if they make the playoffs, Dan. I'm also watching the NFC South, which Tampa Bay has dominated the past four seasons. But the Panthers are a half-game back and keep finding ways to pull off upsets. Panthers coach Dave Canales will get two chances -- in Weeks 16 and 18 -- to knock off his former boss, Bucs coach Todd Bowles. Meanwhile, Bowles' roster is finally getting healthy, and he has a 7-2 December record over the past two seasons.

Which injury holds the biggest playoff race implication, and what are you hearing on the fallout?

Fowler:We mentioned Jones earlier, and he's trying to play through a fibula injury. But he's clearly not 100 percent, and coaches I've talked to who have watched the Colts closely say his mobility appears compromised. Based on my understanding after asking around, it's also an injury that he can play through. In other words, I'm not so sure a few weeks of rest will make the issue better. And Jones is very tough and willing to push through. But the Colts are on the ropes and will need him at his best. Their scoring output has dipped 12 points per game since Week 9. Another signature huge game from Jonathan Taylor would alleviate the pressure on Jones ... and his leg.

Graziano: I spoke with some folks in Houston after the Texans-Colts game Sunday and they said they felt Jones really couldn't move at all. He was able to hit some shots downfield when the pocket held up, but the mobility part of his game is missing, which makes the offense seem more limited. I personally think the injury that has most affected the Colts was the one to defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, and their inability to get the Texans' mediocre run game off the field Sunday shows his injury is still being felt.

Lions wide receiverAmon-Ra St. Brown still has a chance to play Thursday against the Cowboys but hasn't practiced this week. It's possible the sprained ankle he sustained on Thanksgiving could keep him out of what amounts to a must-win game. Detroit is already without tight end Sam LaPorta and probably can't afford to be without St. Brown in a game in which they'll need to score to keep up with the Cowboys.

Also, Chargers quarterbackJustin Herbert had surgery Monday to repair a fracture in his left (non-throwing) hand. He has said he plans to play Monday night against the Eagles, but we will see how much he can practice in advance of that game (if at all) and whether that will affect his performance if he does play. The Chargers are in the middle of an extremely tough, cluttered AFC wild-card race and are two games behind the Broncos in the AFC West.

Fowler: The Patriots have injuries to two key players -- defensive tackle Milton Williams (high ankle sprain) and rookie left tackle Will Campbell (knee sprain) -- that loom large. Williams has validated his massive free agent contract with impressive play, and Campbell has ferociously protectedDrake Maye's blind side. Both should be back before the playoffs, but how New England holds up in the meantime bears watching.

This provides a big opportunity for Vederian Lowe, Campbell's replacement and a 2026 free agent. Capable swing tackles get paid, so money is literally on the line for Lowe. Things went well Monday night, as Maye completed 24 of 31 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns.

Graziano: I really thought those Patriots injuries might show up more Monday night than they did. Good on them for playing well despite them, and I guess shame on the Giants for not being good enough to exploit them. The Patriots go on bye this week and maybe they come out of that healthy (though Campbell is on IR and must sit out at least three more games).

Could the Panthers extend Bryce Young this offseason?

Graziano: I covered the Panthers this past weekend and asked a bunch of their people about Young. And from what I can tell, they still believe in him. They've used 10 different offensive line combinations this season and have a young receiver group, so the team seems to think the ups and downs can be blamed on more than just the quarterback. Young was excellent Sunday in beating the Rams, but he was far less than that against the 49ers the Monday night before. The week before that, he set a single-game franchise record for passing yards in a victory over the Falcons.

It's hard to really know what the long-term outlook is when the swings are this wild week to week. The Panthers will have to decide by the first week of May whether to pick up his fifth-year option for 2027. I expect them to do that because the cost will be reasonable (around $26.5 million), but then the question becomes what to do after that.

Fowler: This feels like the classic wait-and-see situation. Despite showing flashes, Young hasn't progressed beyond midtier starter status. The Panthers have overachieved a bit this season and have viewed 2026 as their true jump year. Whether they want to allocate heavy resources to a Young extension during a crucial offseason remains to be seen. Picking up his fifth-year option and having him play at least a portion of his fourth season on his rookie deal is a sensible play.

But Young has two things going for him. He's proving to be clutch, orchestrating four fourth-quarter comebacks and five game-winning drives this season. And he's showing touch on intermediate-to-deep passes, completing 30 passes of 20 or more yards. So he's giving the front office something to think about long and hard. Should the Panthers engage, what's the sweet spot on his market, Dan? Eleven quarterbacks are making at least $50 million per year.

Graziano: So, if Young is open to an extension in the 2026 offseason, I think it would have to be lucrative to make it worth his while. If the Panthers pick up the fifth-year option, they will have him under contract for two years at around $33 million, so it might be tempting for him take a below-market deal just to improve on that. It might make some sense to do a short-term bridge deal like the one the Packers did with Jordan Love after Year 3 (when he really hadn't played much, because Aaron Rodgers was in front of him). But I don't see what Young's incentive would be to do an extension next spring or summer that averages less than $50 million per year.

The Jaguars extended Trevor Lawrence at $55 million per year after Year 3, and we still don't know whether he's their long-term answer. Teams do wild things when it comes to quarterbacks because they're so scared about having to find one. So unless the Panthers are willing to give Young top-QB market value, he could bet on himself and bet on the team being incentivized to continue to improve around him. Then he could play out the 2026 season and put himself in position to negotiate a bigger deal after that, when the Panthers would have him for only one more year, which tilts the leverage Young's way.

Fowler: Teams are only as good as their quarterback options, and Young is easily the Panthers' best. He also seems to have good chemistry with Canales and his staff. But don't be surprised if teams slightly shift their thinking when it comes to paying quarterbacks and show some level of restraint. If you don't have a bona fide top-10 guy, why pay obscene market prices so early? That's an easy call if you have aJosh Allen, Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow, etc. But Miami (Tua Tagovailoa) and Arizona (Kyler Murray) are among teams saddled with bloated guaranteed money for good, but not great, quarterbacks.

My point is that there's no rush, barring both sides making concessions that work for them. I think Houston could be more inclined to payC.J. Stroud, another QB from the 2023 draft class, early. He has higher-end traits as a passer.

What's the buzz around the league on Shedeur Sanders after two starts?

Fowler: People I've talked to see a quarterback who has decent arm strength and is willing to stay in the pocket and wait for plays to develop. But they also see one who needs more seasoning.

""There were a lot of screens and boots [on Sunday vs. San Francisco] ,"" noted one NFL personnel evaluator who watched the game. ""You can tell they are trying to protect him, which you want to do with almost all rookie quarterbacks. But overall I thought he looked pretty comfortable in the pocket. He just needs time.""

The Browns entered Sanders' Week 12 starting debut believing he could avoid turnovers, which he has done with one interception in two games. He struggled mightily with sacks in college, which the Browns knew would be a concern. So taking only four sacks in two starts is a modest victory. What's your take on Sanders, Dan?

Graziano: To me, and to most of the folks I've asked, Sanders looks like a rookie quarterback. He has made some plays and throws, some of which Dillon Gabriel wasn't making. Sanders has made some mistakes, some of which (like running out of the back of the pocket) align with concerns people have about him. I see no reason why the Browns shouldn't continue starting him, because the point of the rest of their season seems to be finding out what they have at quarterback so they know how to approach the offseason. They have two first-round picks to help them address it if they want. Sanders won his first start, which is no small thing for this Browns team. The fans are into it. He has some talent. Let it ride and see what you've got.

Fowler: The Browns must find out whether their 2026 starting quarterback is on the current roster. The body of work through 12 games suggests it's probably not, but Sanders has a decent runway to give the team something to consider. And my sense is he'll get the rest of the season to do just that. Gabriel is a good decision-maker whose experience showed up in his six starts, but he projects more as a quality No. 2. Coaches I've talked to think Gabriel is slightly further along in his development than Sanders, who has the bigger arm and frame. Armed with two first-round picks (including one in the top five as it stands), the Browns are in prime position to get their future signal-caller, with the chance to supplement him with either a veteran bridge option or a variation of Gabriel/Sanders.

Graziano: If nothing else, Cleveland can come out of this season with some idea whether Gabriel or Sanders can be a solid backup or if one of them is a project the team is willing to continue to work on. Best-case scenario is Sanders lights it up and the Browns enter the offseason thinking he can be the guy long term. I'm not sure how likely that is at this point, but there is no harm in finding out. I know Sanders has a lot of people very worked up on both extremes, but my position is that he's a fifth-round rookie on a bad team that has been looking for a quarterback solution for three decades. The Browns would be fools not to explore every possible solution, and I think that's what they're doing.

Commentators rushed to claim, incorrectly, that Koo, an eight-year veteran with over 400 kicks in the NFL and zero turf-kicks to speak of, tripped on the turf. That he stubbed his toe.

That’s not what happened, according to Koo, who said his refusal to kick was intentional. With most eyes trained on Koo’s foot, it was easy to miss the bobbled snap by holder Jamie Gillan, who was moving the ball as Koo went to kick.

“I was approaching the ball and … the ball kind of slipped out at the bottom so it was moving,” said Koo. “I wasn’t able to kick through the ball. The ball was moving when I was driving to it, so I just pulled up on it.”

Though the slight angle is actually what kickers prefer (Eagles kicker Jake Elliott breaks down the science of a field goal in this YouTube video), and the hold looks nearly identical to prior holds of Gillan’s, Koo lost confidence in the kick.

“Jamie did a good job of catching it and putting it back,” Koo said afterward, “but, at that point, it was too late.”

Unlike golf, an NFL kicker must hit the ball for it to be counted as a miss. So, on paper, Koo has yet to miss a field goal since joining the Giants, while the holder Gillan has a sack added to his resume; that’s some chess by Koo.

NFL’s best: Texans passing defense

I wouldn’t want to be Patrick Mahomes this Sunday. His Chiefs take on the Texans, and 6-6 Kansas City’s playoff odds are at stake; it drops to just 11 percent with a loss, per our Playoff Simulator.

The three worst quarterback groups in the NFL this season, when ranked by passer rating, are the Vikings (69.1), Browns (71.0) and anyone playing the Texans (74.2). Opposing passers throw one touchdown (12 total) for every interception (12), the league’s worst mark.

Quarterbacks also average a league-low of minus-0.10 EPA per dropback against the Texans. Yes, Houston turns every quarterback it faces into Tyler Shough, who averages -.10 EPA per dropback.

What makes Houston so good? A strong secondary, led by shutdown corner Derek Stingley Jr., blankets opposing receivers while its pass rush, led by Will Anderson Jr., collapses the pocket.

About 87 percent of opposing passes come from the pocket (second-most) and Houston has faced just 33 rushing attempts from quarterbacks (second-fewest).

Limiting QBs to the pocket allows Houston’s pass rush to tee off. Opposing passers have just 2.75 seconds per pass, second-lowest in the NFL, and are pressured by the Texans on 43 percent of dropbacks, also the league’s second-best mark.

If Houston maintains the league’s sharpest passing defense, it might just eliminate the Chiefs from the playoff hunt — sweet revenge after Kansas City sent it home last year. Maybe Andy Reid shouldn’t be so optimistic?

Best run defense: Browns

Few teams spend more time trailing than Cleveland, which is why the Browns’ defense has seen 329 rushing attempts — 13th most in the NFL. It’s certainly not because it’s easy.

The Browns defense limits runners to 3.7 yards per carry and a 31.5 success rate, the two lowest marks in the league. The Browns have forced five rushing fumbles, second most, and allow opposing runners to convert first downs at the league’s lowest rate (19.5 percent).

Cleveland’s defensive line crushes opposing lines, with runners averaging just 0.59 yards before contact per attempt — well below the league average of 1.40. It’s why the Browns also lead the league in tackles for a loss, with 94, and why you’ll want to sit any Titans running backs in Week 14.

Top passing offense: Cowboys

The Chiefs, Rams, Lions and Patriots are all having impressive seasons, but the Cowboys’ passing attack has single-handedly kept Dallas in games this season.

Quarterback Dak Prescott leads the league in passing yards per game (271.8) and completions (303), with his 69.3 completion rate the highest rate among quarterbacks with over 400 attempts. Prescott takes sacks at the second-lowest rate in the NFL (just 3.7 percent of dropbacks, 17 total) and has the league’s lowest percentage of bad throws (10).

Prescott skyrocketed up Jeff Howe’s QB Stock Report this week, and now faces the reeling Lions defense, who just allowed Jordan Love to throw for four touchdowns.

Top rushing offense: Bills

As a team, Buffalo leads the league with 1,868 total rushing yards. They are third in success rate, and can credit a combination of James Cook, who has a career-high 1,228, Josh Allen’s running prowess and an elite offensive line that gives Cook 2.23 yards before contact, second-best among running backs in the NFL.

Despite missing their top two tackles against the Steelers, Buffalo still hung 249 rush yards in Pittsburgh, while Cook’s ran for 100-plus yards for the seventh time this season. Buffalo also rarely loses yards on runs, despite facing a loaded box at the second-highest rate (the Seahawks, the only team to face more loaded boxes, rank 31st in runs for zero or negative yards. Buffalo ranks top 10).

That’s a bad omen for my Bengals, who specialize in missing tackles (three of the top four players in missed tackles hail from Cincinnati) and face Buffalo this week. Over to Jake Ciely for a fantasy nugget.

All In with Jake Ciely: RBs to stash

Seems like almost all hope is lost for some, while others prep for the stretch run. One of the few season-altering shifts left is a running back injury. Jacob asked how I would rank the handcuffs likely available in every league.

I target them purely by the strength of the offense they play in, since we can’t predict injuries. So while Giants RB Devin Singletary is worth an add after Tyrone Tracy was carted off with a concussion, here’s how I’d rank other widely available, handcuff running backs.

Ray Davis, Bills

Tank Bigsby, Eagles

Ollie Gordon, Dolphins

Isaiah Davis, Jets

Raheem Mostert, Raiders

If every lead option got hurt, you could argue a more reliable workload for Davis. However, that’s like shopping in the discount bin and complementing the shrink wrap being completely intact.

My Week 14 waiver adds are live, with Kyle Monangai of the Bears my top running back add and Buccaneers receiver Chris Godwin the top add at his position, given that he was separating well, showed burst and was again Baker Mayfield’s No. 1 option.

Extra Points

Remember Laveranues Coles? The former Jets receiver made $42 million in his career, yet at age 47 chose to become a policeman in Jacksonville, Fla. Dan Pompei’s story explains how it starts with a difficult upbringing.

Staying healthy. It seems a tall task for Jaxson Dart, as the Giants rookie QB again absorbed unnecessary (and brutal) hits against the Patriots. Charlotte Carroll explores what the next regime needs to fix.

It seemed likely St. Brown would miss some time when he sustained the injury.
However, head coach Dan Campbell said Tuesday that he has not ruled St. Brown out for Week 14, per Dave Birkett and Rainer Sabin of the Detroit Free Press.
While St. Brown may play, fellow receiver Kalif Raymond is likely to miss his second game in a row with an ankle injury.
The Lions’ injury issues at receiver are especially unfortunate after standout tight end Sam LaPorta underwent back surgery in November.","After a crushing loss to the NFC North rival Packers on Thanksgiving, the Lions are 7-5 and sitting outside of the playoff bracket with five games left in their season. This Thursday’s matchup against the 6-5-1 Cowboys will take on a postseason feel for a pair of teams that can’t afford many more slip-ups (if any).

The Lions may face an uphill climb this week if they go without No. 1 wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, who suffered a low ankle sprain against the Packers. It seemed likely St. Brown would miss some time when he sustained the injury. However, head coach Dan Campbell said Tuesday that he has not ruled St. Brown out for Week 14, per Dave Birkett and Rainer Sabin of the Detroit Free Press.

While St. Brown may play, fellow receiver Kalif Raymond is likely to miss his second game in a row with an ankle injury. That leaves Jameson Williams, rookie third-rounder Isaac TeSlaa, and Tom Kennedy as their top healthy options at the position.

The Lions’ injury issues at receiver are especially unfortunate after standout tight end Sam LaPorta underwent back surgery in November. LaPorta is unlikely to return this season, and backup Brock Wright could also miss significant time as a result of an injury to his trachea, Campbell revealed (via Birkett).

Wright isn’t much of a receiving threat, having averaged fewer than 20 catches per season since entering the league in 2021. He has amassed 401 offensive snaps this year, though, and a lengthy absence would leave the Lions perilously thin at tight end. Ross Dwelley and Anthony Firkser are next on the depth chart.

In better news for Detroit’s offense, left guard Christian Mahogany said he fully expects to return during the regular season after going down with a knee injury in Week 9. After mostly working as a backup in 2024, his rookie year, Mahogany started in his first eight appearances this season. Pro Football Focus ranks his performance a solid 30th among 79 qualifying guards. With Mahogany on IR, reserve Kayode Awosika has temporarily taken on a starting role.

Defensively, the Lions have been without key cog Kerby Joseph since Week 6. A nagging knee injury will keep the 2024 first-team All-Pro safety out of his seventh straight game on Thursday, though it’s not a “career-altering” issue, veteran insider Jordan Schultz reports. Joseph intends to play again this season, but it’s unclear when that will happen.

Thomas Harper, claimed from the Raiders in late August, has been filling for Joseph alongside Brian Branch. Harper has recorded 26 tackles, four passes defensed, and an interception in nine games.

What this means for the Patriots The Patriots can feel good about the state of their team entering the bye.","The New England Patriots celebrated a relatively comfortable 33-15 victory over the New York Giants on Monday night, and will head into their bye week with an 11-2 record and as the No. 1 seed in the AFC. That bye is arriving at a good time for a team that recently had to absorb some injuries.

The game against the Giants also saw some players get shaken up, even though it appears the team avoided any major issues. Let’s assess the damage after rewatching the game.

Patriots injury analysis: Week 13

RB Terrell Jennings: Your classic case of Jennings-on-Jennings crime. Terrell, who had returned a kickoff 39 yards on the game’s first play, sustained a head injury on kick coverage in the late first quarter. He attempted to tackle Giants returner Deonte Banks from behind, but in the process of doing so collided with teammate Anfernee Jennings — a bang-bang play that forced the second-year running back to undergo medical examination in the blue tent on the sidelines. He later left for the locker room and after initially being announced as questionable to return was ruled out with a head injury in the second period.

CB Christian Gonzalez: The Patriots’ star cornerback looked a bit shaken up following Darius Slayton’s 30-yard catch-and-run touchdown in the second quarter. He had slipped while making a tackle attempt from behind. However, he ended up not missing any playing time and showed no limitations whatsoever for the rest of the game.

WR Kayshon Boutte: Also in the second quarter, Kayshon Boutte walked off with a slight limp after catching a short pass from quarterback Drake Maye. He was looked at on the sidelines — all while replacement Kyle Williams caught a 33-yard touchdown — but returned to the game without any visible issues. The third-year man ended up leading all Patriots wide receivers in snaps (49) and was targeted two more times after briefly exiting, catching one pass for 9 yards.

LB Jack Gibbens: Gibbens was announced as “injured during the play” following a run play in the late third quarter, but it looked like an equipment issue more than anything. After one snap on the sideline, he was back in action.

LB Robert Spillane: The Patriots’ starting linebacker had played 100% of defensive snaps in 10 of the Patriots’ 12 games entering Monday, but he was suspiciously absent at times against the Giants and also did not hold court with the media after the game. A reason for concern? No. With the team jumping to a 30-7 halftime lead, the team captain was simply given some rest for a change down the stretch. Something similar happened against the Carolina Panthers earlier in the year.

What this means for the Patriots

The Patriots can feel good about the state of their team entering the bye. Sure, several starters were unavailable against the Giants — LT Will Campbell (knee/IR), LG Jared Wilson (ankle), DT Milton Williams (ankle/IR), DT Khyiris Tonga (chest) — and there were some minor incidents besides Terrell Jennings’ head injury, but all in all the team appears to be trending in a positive direction health-wise.

The bye week is nonetheless coming at an opportune time.

Not only will it allow high-volume players such as the aforementioned Robert Spillane to get some much-needed rest, it also is a chance for players to treat minor injuries and the weekly bumps and bruises that appear. Christian Gonzalez and Kayshon Boutte are prime examples; neither was visibly hampered but still were shaken up at one point versus New York.

They and the rest of the team will now have several days off to get ready for the final four games of the regular season, and what the Patriots hope to be a deep playoff run. Players will be off Wednesday through Sunday, Dec. 7, before returning to the practice fields on Monday, Dec. 8.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/12/gettyimages-2249614813.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=2.1701385498047%2C7.756995933802%2C97.829861450195%2C76.829661151459&w=1200,N,,2025-12-03 06:58:29.524392

Baltimore Ravens cornerback Nate Wiggins left the Ravens’ Thanksgiving loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in the third quarter due to a foot injury.

The good news is that Wiggins’ injury is not serious, in terms of a long-term injury, according to Ravens head coach John Harbaugh, who provided the latest injury update on Wiggins on Monday.

“Nate’s day-to-day right now,” Harbaugh said. “We’ll see where he’s at on Wednesday and we’ll see where he’s at going forward from there.”

Wiggins is now in his second NFL season following a strong rookie campaign in 2024 after being drafted by Baltimore in the first round (30th overall) of the 2024 NFL Draft.

Wiggins has a team-leading three interceptions this season, to go with nine passes defended and 47 total tackles, including two tackles for loss. He has played in all 12 of his team’s games, starting 11 of them.

In 15 regular season games as a rookie last season, Wiggins tallied 33 tackles, 13 passes defended, a forced fumble and his first career interception – a pick-six in Baltimore’s Week 18 win over the Cleveland Browns. The former first-team All-ACC selection added six more tackles and a quarterback hit in two playoff games.

In his career at Clemson from 2021-23, Wiggins recorded 50 tackles (3.0 for loss), 24 pass breakups, three interceptions (including two returned for touchdowns), two forced fumbles, a sack and a blocked field goal over 34 games (18 starts).

Up next for the Ravens (6-6) is a big divisional matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6) this Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. The two teams are tied atop the AFC North entering Week 14.

The Vikings may also regain key offensive linemen, with O’Connell noting that Christian Darrisaw, Donovan Jackson, and Ryan Kelly all have a chance to return in Week 14.
How McCarthy performs in his return will determine whether the Vikings can stabilize their season over the remaining five contests.","The Minnesota Vikings reach Week 14, balancing uncertainty with a rare bit of optimism. Following weeks defined by injuries, stalled drives, and a shutout loss, the team finally received a development that could influence the direction of its season.

Whether that shift becomes meaningful depends on how their young quarterback responds in the coming days.

How Does J.J. McCarthy’s Status Shape the Minnesota Vikings’ Path?

J.J. McCarthy has been sidelined since suffering a concussion during the Vikings’ 23-6 loss to the Green Bay Packers.

Underdog NFL reported on X that he is now entirely symptom-free and will take part in a full practice session on Wednesday. If he handles that workload without any setbacks, he is expected to start Sunday’s home matchup against the Washington Commanders.

Head coach Kevin O’Connell confirmed McCarthy’s progress, saying, “He’s symptom-free and now the last phase I believe of the protocol is just he needs to just have a full practice day, and that should come on Wednesday.” O’Connell added that a standard practice week would put McCarthy in a position to reclaim the starting job.

McCarthy’s absence opened the door for undrafted rookie Max Brosmer, who struggled in a 26-0 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Brosmer completed 19 of 30 attempts for 126 yards with four interceptions, reflecting the broader issues across the Vikings’ offense.

The Vikings have scored just six points in their last eight quarters and hold the league’s No. 29-ranked unit.

Individually, McCarthy is still searching for a consistent footing. He has thrown for 929 yards with six touchdowns and 10 interceptions while completing 54.1 percent of his passes. PFSN’s QB Impact metric lists him with a QB Impact Score of 52.5, receiving an F grade, ranking 40th this season and 897th overall since 2000.

He has started six games and completed 86 of 159 passes, numbers that match the dataset’s season averages. These metrics highlight both his potential and the urgency behind his development.

McCarthy will have an opportunity to reset against a Commanders defense that has struggled throughout the season, allowing high totals in yards, points, and passing production. The Vikings may also regain key offensive linemen, with O’Connell noting that Christian Darrisaw, Donovan Jackson, and Ryan Kelly all have a chance to return in Week 14.

O’Connell summarized the situation by emphasizing the importance of adapting to challenges, stating that his focus remains on transforming the offense and finding ways to win games. How McCarthy performs in his return will determine whether the Vikings can stabilize their season over the remaining five contests.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/02144438/jj-mccarthy-injury-update-12-02-25-1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 12:03:25.938773

London has missed two full games – and overtime of another – while dealing with a knee injury he suffered in Week 11.
Drake London stats London had recorded at least 100 yards in each of the three games prior to suffering his knee injury.","Some good news is coming for the Atlanta Falcons, even if it may be too late to save their season and playoff hopes.

Head coach Raheem Morris told reporters on Dec. 1 that Drake London may be nearing a return after missing two games with a knee injury. London had put together three straight 100-yard games before sustaining the malady at the end of Atlanta's Week 11 game against the Carolina Panthers.

While the Falcons' top receiver may return soon, their starting quarterback will not. Michael Penix Jr. has been ruled out for the remainder of the season after undergoing surgery to repair a partial ACL tear. Meanwhile, Atlanta is 4-8 – three games behind the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the division lead, which is its only likely path to the postseason.

Regardless of the Falcons' long-term outlook, London's return could provide a spark for the team to finish on a high note. For fantasy managers, it could be what gives their team a final push to a league championship this year.

Here's what to know about London's injury status in Week 14:

When will Drake London return?

Morris, the Falcons' head coach, told reporters on Dec. 1 that London's status has been upgraded from week-to-week to day-to-day. That suggests Atlanta's top wide receiver could return to the field as early as Week 14's clash with the Seattle Seahawks.

London has missed two full games – and overtime of another – while dealing with a knee injury he suffered in Week 11. That's brought his total to three missed games this season after he was held out in Week 8 with a hip injury. The fourth-year wideout had never missed more than one game in a season prior to this year.

As injury reports for Week 14 begin on Wednesday, Dec. 3, London's availability will become clearer. If he does return this week, it will be with Falcons backup quarterback Kirk Cousins throwing London the ball with Penix out for the season with a partially torn ACL.

Drake London stats

London had recorded at least 100 yards in each of the three games prior to suffering his knee injury. Here's how his stats look through 13 weeks and nine games played:

Targets: 94

Receptions: 60

Receiving yards: 810

Yards/reception: 13.5

Touchdowns: 6

London's 13.5 yards per catch would be a career high in a single season. The Falcons' leading receiver is averaging exactly 90 yards per game and could still be on pace to reach the 1,000-yard mark for a second straight year if he returns soon. He's also three touchdowns shy of matching his career high of nine, which he set last year.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/02/USAT/87570964007-drake-london-falcons-imagn.jpg?crop=6414,3608,x0,y334&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-03 03:58:15.822176

While the tundra certainly be frozen at Lambeau Field for the NFL's oldest rivalry, the pregame buzz has more heat than usual — for both teams.

The surprising Bears (9-3) lead the Packers by a half-game (8-3-1) in the division as the two teams, after not meeting until Week 14, play twice in the next three weeks.

Chicago's decision to hire former Detroit Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson as head coach has been a sharp one. Second-year quarterback Caleb Williams and the Bears have won nine of their last 10 games and five in a row. The team rushed for 281 yards in a 24-15 victory over the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles on Nov. 28.

The Packers are also coming off an impressive win over the Lions for the second time this season and are 3-0 against division opponents after going 1-5 last year. The Packers have won three straight games after losing consecutive games at Lambeau Field to the Carolina Panthers and the Eagles at home.

Both teams have other playoff contenders on their remaining schedule remaining — the Packers play the AFC West-leading Denver Broncos next week — making the two upcoming head-to-head matchups even more important.

Packers injury update

Running back MarShawn Lloyd is among three Packers who could return from injury in the next three weeks.

The Packers opened the three-week window for activation by having Lloyd, defensive end Brenton Cox Jr. and linebacker Collin Oliver practice Dec. 1, according to the NFL's transaction wire.

Lloyd has been on injured reserve since suffering a groin pull in training camp. The Packers used one of two designated-to-return options afforded them for players injured in training camp. If they hadn’t used it, Lloyd would have been out for the season if put on injured reserve.

Coach Matt LaFleur also confirmed that defensive lineman Devonte Wyatt is out for the rest of the season due to ligament damage in his ankle.

Bears injury update

Though cornerbacks Jaylon Johnson and Kyler Gordon were activated off injured reserve before the Bears' victory over the Eagles, they were missing fellow defensive back Tyrique Stevenson due to a hip problem and linebackers T.J. Edwards (hand/hamstring), Noah Sewell (elbow), and Ruben Hyppolite II (shoulder). Defensive end Dominique Robinson was also out due to a concussion.

Packers-Bears last meeting

Quarterback Jordan Love missed much of the Jan. 5 game after injuring his elbow, and the Bears beat the Packers, 24-22, for the first time since LaFleur became the Packers' coach.

However, during Brock Purdy’s time rehabbing from a turf toe injury, the 49ers’ franchise quarterback took away some lessons from Mac Jones.

“Definitely learned from him in terms of being efficient,” Purdy explained Tuesday on KNBR’s “Murph and Markus.” “Taking what the defense gives you, trying to stay on the field, find ways to get points whether it’s good-looking or not, like kicking a field goal after a checkdown.”

Purdy, who missed eight games this season due to his injury, explained that his symbiotic relationship with Jones has helped him grow this year.

“It’s little things like that that’s playing NFL quarterback and hopefully we can continue to push each other and help each other out as we go down the stretch here, but extremely thankful for that guy, that’s for sure,"" Purdy said.

Jones acquitted himself well in the fill-in role. He kept the 49ers afloat with a 5-3 record in his starts.

As Purdy mentioned, Jones also was very efficient. He averaged 215.1 passing yards per game with a career-high 69.6 completion percentage.

""More than anything, him going out there and keeping our team alive, and making plays and straight up ballin’ out -- it’s really cool,” Purdy said.

Aside from football strategy, Purdy took note of Jones’ demeanor when commanding the San Francisco offense.

“He’s hilarious. Just his charisma and his personality, like he’s awesome. Honestly, it’s been good for me to have a guy that you can see play quarterback and have fun with it,” Purdy said. “Because for me, I’m so serious about my job and everything – which is great – but it’s cool to see him have fun with it and learn from him in that regard.”

Purdy returned to play in the 49ers’ Week 11 win over the Arizona Cardinals and has averaged 187 passing yards per game with a 67.6 completion percentage through Week 13. He has thrown five touchdowns with three interceptions.

Although the individual statistics are not eye-popping, the 49ers are 3-0 since Purdy’s return.

""My focus right now is on supporting Kafka as we go forward and we'll evaluate all aspects of the football operation as we go forward,"" Schoen said.
Schoen was asked on Tuesday why Daboll was held accountable but he seemingly has not.
Ownership made a decision to move on and, again, I'm going to control what I can control and that's support (interim HC Mike) Kafka moving forward,"" Schoen said.
Wide receiver Malik Nabers had a standout rookie season in 2024 before a knee injury ended his sophomore season in September.","The New York Giants sit at 2-11 following Monday's lopsided loss to the New England Patriots, eliminated from the playoffs for a third consecutive season and currently led by an interim head coach.

General manager Joe Schoen on Tuesday faced the heat from a contentious New York media, answering questions on the roster he assembled this season and why he should be in charge next season.

""I understand the frustrations of the fans, the ownership, people inside the building, and nobody's more frustrated than myself,"" Schoen said during his new conference preceding New York's bye week.

""It starts with me, and I'm tasked with trying to get this organization going back in the proper direction, and the standard is to compete for championships year in, year out. That's the plan moving forward. So, we're going to look at everything -- free agency, draft, coaching, finishing, execution on the field; whatever it may be -- we're going to look at all avenues in order to get this franchise back to where it belongs.""

Schoen joined New York during the 2022 offseason and the Giants saw early success under him and former head coach Brian Daboll, winning a playoff game in their first season at the helm. Since then, however, the franchise has cratered and is sitting at a third consecutive season of at least 11 losses.

That futility cost Daboll his job on Nov. 11. In announcing the decision to part ways with Daboll, the Giants said that Schoen would remain in his position and will lead the search for a new head coach. Assistant Mike Kafka took over interim HC duties after Daboll's firing, and Schoen told reporters on Tuesday that Kafka is ""getting a real look right now"" at getting the role full-time.

""My focus right now is on supporting Kafka as we go forward and we'll evaluate all aspects of the football operation as we go forward,"" Schoen said. ""Has it been perfect? No, but I'm very confident in my staff, in myself, and our ability to get this franchise back to where it needs to go.""

Schoen was asked on Tuesday why Daboll was held accountable but he seemingly has not.

""My hand's in it just like Brian's. Ownership made a decision to move on and, again, I'm going to control what I can control and that's support (interim HC Mike) Kafka moving forward,"" Schoen said. ""I wish Dabs nothing but the best, and we're going to do everything we can to get this franchise back to where it should be.""

Schoen appeared to have entered a make-or-break offseason this past winter after the Giants went 3-14 in 2024. When told that the franchise is in the same position now as it was a year ago, Schoen pointed to a young nucleus of talent that should provide reason for optimism.

The Giants appear to have hit on a potential franchise QB after trading back into the first round to select Jaxson Dart, and rookie running back Cam Skattebo was a brief sensation out of the backfield before he suffered a season-ending injury. Wide receiver Malik Nabers had a standout rookie season in 2024 before a knee injury ended his sophomore season in September.

""We do have a good, young quarterback that's on a rookie contract for the next four years,"" Schoen said. ""That's when it gets fun -- when you're building around a young quarterback, you have a good nucleus, you have a good left tackle, you have a wide receiver that had a historic year in his rookie season, you got a good running back room, you got good pass rushers. There are pieces in place, and I do understand the question. I do have confidence in our ability and our process to find the next coach to lead the organization.""

One of those supposed building blocks -- No. 3 overall pick Abdul Carter -- has had a disappointing rookie campaign, marred by multiple disciplinary issues.

Carter was benched for the first quarter of Monday's loss, which marked his second benching to begin a game in three weeks.

Schoen defended Carter on Tuesday, while supporting Kafka in how he disciplines players.

""(Carter's) smart and understands the magnitude of his actions and also understands what it means to be a pro,"" Schoen said. ""These kids are 21 years old and they're thrust in the spotlight in New York City. It's not always going to be perfect.""

Dart has also faced questions about his style of play after he missed two games due to a concussion and endured a number of big hits when he returned to action on Monday.

""What makes these players great is their toughness, their competitiveness, their desire to win,"" Schoen said. ""You appreciate that about Jaxson, but you also have to be available and try not to take the unnecessary hits. I would say last night was probably unnecessary, probably could have gotten out of bounds and it's third-and-1. Instead, we get a penalty, and he takes a shot and now it's third-and-16. There's a fine line, and what makes Jaxson great is his competitiveness, his desire to win and that's the way he's wired. So, you try and find a fine line between playing smart but also not taking away what makes him great.""",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/uele6uptyuwh74kxnvif,N,,2025-12-03 03:58:21.813621

#Bengals #NFL #TheStoneShieldsShow","On today's show Wayne Box Miller of the Bengals Radio Network join the show to discuss Trey Hendrickson's injury, Joe Burrow's return and more. Also, we have our latest NFL Power Rankings, more thoughts on Lane Kiffin leaving for LSU and discuss UC's win over Tarleton State.

The Cincinnati Bengals' defense faces yet another blow as star defensive end Trey Hendrickson is poised to miss his fifth consecutive game this Sunday in Buffalo against the Bills. Head coach Zac Taylor confirmed Monday that Hendrickson remains ""doubtful"" due to a nagging hip/pelvis injury—officially listed as a core muscle issue—that has sidelined him since exiting early in Week 8 against the New York Jets on October 26. Now 37 days removed from his last snap, Hendrickson's prolonged rehab has raised eyebrows, with no clear timeline for return despite the team's playoff aspirations.

This isn't just a minor setback for a player who entered 2025 with an NFL-best 35 sacks over the prior two seasons. Hendrickson, a three-time Pro Bowler, has already tallied four sacks, eight QB hits, and a forced fumble in just seven games this year. His absence has forced the Bengals to lean on rookies like Myles Murphy and Joseph Ossai, who have shown flashes—Myrphy's recent breakout sacks offer a silver lining—but lack Hendrickson's disruptive prowess. Without him, Cincinnati's pass rush ranks a middling 18th league-wide, allowing opponents to protect quarterbacks like Josh Allen with relative comfort. In a pivotal AFC North clash—the Bengals sit at 4-8 but alive for a wild-card spot after snapping a skid against Baltimore—Hendrickson's void could prove costly against Buffalo's high-powered offense.

Taylor's ""week-to-week"" management, avoiding injured reserve, signals optimism for a late-season surge, but reports hint at potential offseason surgery for the sports hernia. Hendrickson's offseason holdout, resolved with a $14 million raise, adds irony: the 30-year-old is now fully invested, yet his body betrays him. Fans and analysts alike fret over his 2026 impact, but for now, the focus is survival. If Cincinnati upsets the Bills without him, it might buy time for a heroic return; otherwise, playoff dreams—and Hendrickson's season—could fade into irrelevance. The Bengals' roar hinges on depth, but Hendrickson's silence echoes loudest.

Alvin Kamara suffered an MCL sprain in his right knee in week 12, causing him to miss week 13 and potentially one to two more games.
Amon-Ra St. Brown suffered an ankle injury on Thanksgiving that initially appeared to be the dreaded high ankle sprain, but sounds like it was actually a medial ankle sprain, not quite as concerning.
Chris Olave had a solid game in week 13 despite dealing with back spasms the entire week.
Tee Higgins missed week 13 due to a concussion and hopefully can return for week 14.","For running backs, Kyren Williams briefly left the game with an ankle sprain, but should be good to go. Aaron Jones re-injured his left AC sprain from early November and has the potential to return in week 14 without missing any time. Dylan Sampson suffered a calf injury, but sounds like it is mild and could potentially play in week 14, despite Jerome Ford lurking. Woody Marks got lucky with a midfoot sprain and should continue to lead the Houston backfield. Saquon Barkley entered week 13 with a groin injury and continued to put up another subpar performance. Alvin Kamara suffered an MCL sprain in his right knee in week 12, causing him to miss week 13 and potentially one to two more games. They have declined reports of shutting him down for the season. Devin Neal filled in admirably in his absence. Josh Jacobs looked pretty good only one week after spraining his left knee and should only get better with time. Bucky Irving returned from an extended absence, secondary to a midfoot sprain and a left shoulder dislocation. He picked up where he left off, and had a fantastic fantasy day. As far as the Cardinals backfield, Bam Knight and Michael Carter continued to split the work, with Emari Demercado dealing with a high-ankle sprain, and Trey Benson struggling to return from his significant MCL sprain and meniscal tear. Hopefully Benson can return in the next 2 weeks. Kimani Vidal put up monster numbers in week 13, as we anticipate the return of Omarion Hampton in the next one to two weeks, returning from a left ankle fracture. I expect some type of committee when he returns.

Amon-Ra St. Brown suffered an ankle injury on Thanksgiving that initially appeared to be the dreaded high ankle sprain, but sounds like it was actually a medial ankle sprain, not quite as concerning. The Lions play on Thursday night and I think it’s going to be very difficult for Brown to be effective if he tries to suit up. Marvin Harrison Jr., returning after missing a couple games due to an appendectomy, suffered a heel injury that could potentially cost him another game. These are usually bruises, injuries to the plantar fascia or sometimes fractures. Davante Adams is reportedly dealing with some hamstring soreness, but not overly concerning as he continues his incredible touchdown run. Chris Olave had a solid game in week 13 despite dealing with back spasms the entire week. Tee Higgins missed week 13 due to a concussion and hopefully can return for week 14. DK Metcalf struggled with his ankle injury and poor QB play. The Jaguars potentially lost Parker Washington due to a hip injury, no details have been released yet. In his first game back from a high ankle sprain, Brian Thomas Jr. struggled, hopefully he gets better.

Despite being banged up with knee and calf injuries, George Pickens continued to have another monster week, which I expect to continue when he faces the Lions in week 14. There is a chance Drake London returns this week from his PCL sprain, but he may struggle in his first week back and is at increased risk of reinjury. Mike Evans could potentially return in the next one to two weeks after having his clavicle surgically repaired. I expect him to pick up where he left off with no restrictions. Chris Godwin has had a rough year, finally looking healthy after suffering a left fracture dislocation of his left ankle and a re-injury about a month ago. The Bucs finally provided an update on Jalen McMillan, who fractured three cervical vertebrae in the preseason. There’s a chance he could return in the next couple of weeks as well. The Packers Jayden Reed, who is returning from a clavicle fracture and a Jones fracture in his foot could potentially return in the next two weeks. He is not medically cleared yet, likely due to the foot, which is still at high risk of refracture until 11 weeks postoperative. He should immediately slide into an important role for the Packers when he returns.",https://cdn-ilagkap.nitrocdn.com/aOEHXheMeCIspnAjcULUenvslcGnhuIC/assets/images/optimized/rev-d97d4bc/www.theinjuryexpertz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/cropped-Injury-Expertz-Favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-03 03:00:23.743921

,,2025-12-02 23:05:54+00:00,ESPN.com,Answering top questions on Brandon Aiyuk's future with 49ers - ESPN,"Nick Wagoner, Mel Kiper Jr, Eric Karabell, Tristan H. Cockcroft, John Keim, Courtney Cronin, Josh Weinfuss, Ryan McFadden, Mike Reiss, Jordan Raanan",,,,,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47172027/will-brandon-aiyuk-return-san-francisco-49ers-season-faq,"The Niners tried to grant that request only for Aiyuk to use his contract leverage to nix those offers.
So a week before the season, the 49ers gave Aiyuk an extension that included $76 million in guarantees.
But Aiyuk missed multiple rehabilitation sessions in the offseason and the Niners voided his 2026 guarantees, including that option bonus.
Still, in Aiyuk's case, it seems like there would have to be a major shift for him to play for the Niners this season or in the future.
In late November, it was mentioned to Shanahan that the voiding of Aiyuk's guarantees seemed to point to his eventual departure.","The San Francisco 49ers are at their Week 14 bye and though they're looking forward to some much-needed downtime, they're also reaching critical mass when it comes to wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk's status for the rest of the season and beyond.

Coach Kyle Shanahan said the Niners won't open anyone's -- including Aiyuk's -- practice window during the bye which means there are four more weeks for Aiyuk to return to practice and, potentially, play in the regular season.

Of course, while the 27-year-old has yet to be physically cleared to return from a torn ACL, MCL and meniscus in his right knee (an injury he suffered in Week 7 last season), it remains to be seen if he will even do so if he gets the green light. That's because, in July, the 49ers took the drastic step of voiding the roughly $27 million in guarantees contained in Aiyuk's contract for 2026 after Aiyuk failed to live up to the contract he signed in August 2024, including missed rehab sessions.

""I've been coaching over 20 years, and I've never been in a situation where a contract's been voided,"" Shanahan said on Nov. 22. ""It's extremely unusual to me.""

Now, the 49ers and Aiyuk are at a crossroads where his talent could be of use as the Niners (9-4) make a playoff push, but a potential return could also prove a distraction if he and the 49ers aren't able to put aside their differences.

Now a once promising future for the Niners and Aiyuk looks far murkier than it did on Aug. 29, 2024, when the sides signed a four-year, $120 million extension that, at the time, was the second largest in franchise history.

ESPN NFL Nation 49ers reporter Nick Wagoner, senior NFL insiders Dan Graziano and Jeremy Fowler, and NFL draft analyst Jordan Reid weigh in on what lies ahead for Aiyuk and the Niners.

How did the 49ers and Aiyuk get here?

Throughout the 2024 training camp, Aiyuk and the 49ers engaged in a contentious contract negotiation in which Aiyuk requested a trade after taking to social media multiple times to voice his displeasure. The Niners tried to grant that request only for Aiyuk to use his contract leverage to nix those offers. At the time, it seemed that the right amount of money might buy happiness for both parties.

So a week before the season, the 49ers gave Aiyuk an extension that included $76 million in guarantees.

But it didn't take long for those good feelings to vanish. Soon after Aiyuk signed, he and Shanahan had an awkward public exchange on the practice field on Sept. 27, 2024, when Aiyuk wore red shorts when the rest of the team was wearing the required black ones. Aiyuk was seen taking the shorts off on the field and kicking them as he changed in to the correct ones. That it happened publicly after Aiyuk signed the contract was a signal that all was not well despite the new deal.

Aiyuk then struggled on the playing field. He was averaging 58.5 yards per game with no touchdowns in the first six weeks. Then, he suffered a devastating knee injury on Oct. 20, ending his season.

At that point, the frustration of the contract negotiations lingered.

Multiple sources told ESPN that the Niners had hoped to trade him last offseason but the injury put an end to any realistic hopes of a good return in trade, though, as the market for an injured player with a big contract never materialized.

On April 1, Aiyuk's $24.935 million roster bonus for 2026 became guaranteed. But Aiyuk missed multiple rehabilitation sessions in the offseason and the Niners voided his 2026 guarantees, including that option bonus.

Still, Aiyuk earned praise from Shanahan and receivers coach Leonard Hankerson for taking an active role in helping the receivers and rehabbing in training camp, perhaps in an effort to get the Niners to reconsider the voided guarantees.

Aiyuk had 50 days from when his guarantees were voided to file a noninjury grievance (recourse for the player through the NFLPA that allows them to challenge club punishments related to contracts, fines or suspensions), but he did not. And though he has been around the facility for rehab in recent weeks, his presence for team activities and practice has been scarce, though teammates say they have been in contact with him.

""I reach out to him as much as I can, check on him,"" receiver Ricky Pearsall said before the 49ers' Week 12 win against the Panthers. ""Sometimes when you're in this business, you're always busy. He's busy doing his thing, so sometimes you're not communicating every single day. You would like to check on people like that. But when he pops in my head and I think of him, I'll reach out to him."" -- Wagoner

Will Aiyuk play for the 49ers again?

If the surprising 2022 Jimmy Garoppolo reunion taught us anything, it's that nothing should be ruled out. Still, in Aiyuk's case, it seems like there would have to be a major shift for him to play for the Niners this season or in the future.

In late November, it was mentioned to Shanahan that the voiding of Aiyuk's guarantees seemed to point to his eventual departure. At the time, Shanahan demurred.

""What happened in July, to me, doesn't have anything to do with the future,"" Shanahan said then. ""When it comes to the future of this, I would love for B.A. to be here. I would love for him to get healthy and get back to really helping us out and being a part of this team. We haven't had that in a little bit and I still hold out hope that he can get there. But he obviously hasn't gotten there yet.""

It should be noted that Aiyuk is on the physically unable to perform list, not injured reserve, which means the Niners could, in theory, open his practice window to see how healthy he is and how he might fit back into a team he hasn't played with in more than a year before possibly activating him and it wouldn't count against their allotment of eight players they can designate to return from IR. The window for Aiyuk to return to practice or be activated could extend if the Niners make the postseason.

Also, Aiyuk's knee injury was severe and it's fair to wonder if he can perform near the standard he has played at previously, which might make sitting the rest of the regular season more prudent if he can't be at or near full strength.

There is also a delicate balance to keep in mind in the locker room. And while the Niners could use someone of Aiyuk's considerable talents on the field, they also need to ensure they don't disrupt the chemistry and culture this year's team has built during an adverse season.

The more likely scenario is that Aiyuk and the Niners decline to bring him back this season and then part ways -- in whatever form that might take -- in the offseason when the Niners won't have nearly the financial burden they would have before voiding his future guarantees. -- Wagoner

What would be the contract and salary cap implications of moving on from Aiyuk?

With the future guarantees voided, the contract math on Aiyuk is pretty simple. The 49ers would incur a $29.585 million dead-money cap charge if they release him outright. They could designate him as a post-June 1 release and spread that money over two years, carrying a $13.325 million dead-money charge in 2026 and the rest in 2027. And the same math applies if they traded him -- a $29.585 million dead-money hit with the option to spread it over two years if they were to deal him after June 1.

Reminder: Teams cannot trade a player before June 1 and designate the move as a post-June 1 transaction. They would have to actually wait until after June 1 to trade him to be able to spread the dead money out, or else absorb the full $29.585 million dead-money hit in 2026. -- Graziano

What sort of market would exist for Aiyuk in free agency if he is released?

Somewhere on the top shelf of available free agent receivers. Dallas' George Pickens is considered the top option, but Dallas could take him off the market with the franchise tag. Aiyuk would most likely be in the class with Indianapolis' Alec Pierce and Green Bay's Romeo Doubs. His turbulent past two years in San Francisco must be accounted for, but he's only 27 and has a transferable skill -- he's an elite route runner, assuming he becomes healthy enough to still beat corners.

One team to potentially watch for Aiyuk is Washington. He is close with quarterback Jayden Daniels, his former teammate at Arizona State. And general manager Adam Peters -- a John Lynch disciple from his time in San Francisco -- understands the Aiyuk experience well. -- Fowler

Will the 49ers be looking to add another receiver in the 2026 NFL draft? If so, who would be a good fit?

The 49ers have been diligent in drafting wide receiver talent, as they've selected at least one in four of the past five years. And with another loaded class of wideouts on deck in 2026, San Francisco will likely be searching for talent at the position once again.

One common trait the Niners look for in wide receiver prospects is the ability to pick up yards after the catch. And that means KC Concepcion (Texas A&M) and Chris Bell (Louisville) would be two realistic options at the back end of Round 1 -- the 49ers are projected to pick No. 28, per ESPN's Football Power Index -- and both would make a lot of sense. Concepcion has 423 yards after the catch this season, while Bell has 378. -- Reid",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1202%2Fr1583553_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 22:59:25.050854

Not only did he provide another veteran presence on the defensive line, but also his ability to pass rush from the interior created opportunities for himself and for teammates across the defensive line to pressure and bring down opposing quarterbacks.
Collins' stats quietly illustrated how his presence on the defensive line was undeniably effective.
That hurt the whole defensive line right there.
Graham had played alongside Collins in the interior, starting all 12 games this season, while Harris has appeared in each game.","A career season for DT Maliek Collins has been unexpectedly cut short.

Head coach Kevin Stefanski announced on Dec. 1 that Collins would miss the remainder of the 2025 season with the quad injury that will require surgery. Collins sustained the injury in the third quarter of Week 13 against the 49ers and was carted off the field with the injury, then ruled out for the remainder of the game.

""Very disappointed for Maliek, he's obviously been playing such good football, and he provides great leadership for this team,"" Stefanski said. ""He's made a big impact on this football team on the field and off the field. I think our young room, we have some older guys in there, but we have a lot a bunch of young guys in there. I think they've learned a lot from the professional that Maliek is on a day in and day out basis, and I think you have to carry that with you throughout.""

His absence for the remainder of the season is a tough loss for the Browns' defense that has been a dominant force up front through 12 games. Not only did he provide another veteran presence on the defensive line, but also his ability to pass rush from the interior created opportunities for himself and for teammates across the defensive line to pressure and bring down opposing quarterbacks. He was disruptive, defeating blocks in one-on-one situations and was affective in their run defense.

Collins recorded a career-high 6.5 sacks, as well as a game-high 2.5 sacks in Week 12 against the Raiders. He also had 12 quarterback hits, seven tackles for loss, 24 tackles and one fumble recovery this season.

Not only did Collins capitalize on his own success, but his impact on the defensive line created opportunities on the edge for players like DE Myles Garrett – who has 19 total sacks this season and 30 quarterback hits. Earlier in the season, Garrett called Collins ""one of the most unique rushers I've had the privilege to be around with the combination of finesse and power.

Collins' stats quietly illustrated how his presence on the defensive line was undeniably effective. Collins entered Week 13 leading defensive tackles in the league in sacks and was on his way to a potential Pro-Bowl nod for his weekly contributions to the Browns' dominant defensive front.

""He's been amazing. He's done a great job,"" Garrett said following the Browns' 26-8 loss to the 49ers. ""I mean as far as his trajectory, he was going to have a double-digit sack season which he had yet to do. And it sucks seeing him go down, and just hurt seeing that look on his face, just disappointed, knowing that he had so much left for the year and giving more to this team. So, we're behind him 100 percent and we're going to support him however we can.""

When Collins signed with the Browns during the early days of free agency in March 2025, he knew he was joining a defensive scheme that benefited his skillset. He wanted to continue playing in an attack-style defense – the only defensive style he had played in during his NFL career – as well as have the chance to reunite with defensive line coach Jacques Cesaire.

He quickly stepped into his leadership role, as before training camp began, Collins worked out with rookie DT Mason Graham to help him acclimate to the NFL. Graham said he has continued to rely on Collins throughout the 2025 season, asking questions and working with him on his style of play.

Over the course of the season, Stefanski said he admired Collins' approach to his role through how he works on his craft early on the practice field, takes notes in the meeting rooms and provides a veteran leader to younger players on the defensive line. With his dedication to his game, leadership qualities and ability to make plays in both the run and the pass, Collins also served as a game captain in Week 4 against the Lions.

""(DT) Maliek (Collins) is one of our leaders,"" DT Shelby Harris said. ""He's one of our favorite guys, and it's always tough to lose somebody like that who's having a career year and someone who is truly happy for everyone else's success. That hurt the whole defensive line right there. That is one of our guys and you never want to see somebody go down like that.""

With Collins out for the remaining five games of the season, the Browns will rely on two younger players in Graham and DT Mike Hall Jr., as well as a veteran in Harris to fill the snaps Collins took each week. Graham had played alongside Collins in the interior, starting all 12 games this season, while Harris has appeared in each game.

Graham has 31 tackles, including five tackles for loss and four passes defensed in his rookie season. Harris has recorded 21 tackles, six tackles for loss and three quarterback hits. He recorded four tackles and a tackle for loss against the 49ers, three of which came after Collins exited the game.

Hall provides depth to the interior after returning in Week 8 from a knee injury that caused him to miss the first seven games of the season. In five games, Hall has six tackles, two tackles for loss, four quarterback hits and 1.5 sacks. His best game came against the Raiders in Week 12 with four tackles and two quarterback hits.

In the final stretch of the season, the Browns will find that combination to fill the interior spot on the defense and help sustain that interior pass rush presence.

""When you lose a guy like Maliek, you don't replace him. Everybody's just got to step up. It's multiple guys that have to step up,"" Stefanski said.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/browns/w52duvrspkwnouobxtl3,N,,2025-12-02 19:03:28.048026

""Guy made a good hit,"" he said.
In the game in which Dart was hurt last month, they used him on six designed runs.
Fortunately for Dart and the Giants, the quarterback said he felt good coming out of Monday night's game.
I feel like if I just turn into a complete pocket passer, that's just not how I want to play the game.","FOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart took a bone-crushing hit near the sideline in the first quarter of Monday night's 33-15 loss to the New England Patriots. Even though he probably could have stepped out of bounds earlier and gained a few less yards, he said he wouldn't change a thing.

It doesn't matter that Dart sat out the previous two games because of a concussion and was checked for a concussion in four of the previous eight games.

""No, look, I understand the question, but this is football,"" Dart said. ""I'm going to get hit if I'm in the pocket or outside the pocket. I feel like I played this way my whole entire life. It shouldn't be any shocker to anybody if you followed along with my career.

""We're not playing soccer out here. You're going to get hit. Things happen. It's just part of the game.""

Dart said he was scrambling out of the pocket on the second-and-13 play and was trying to get the first down before Christian Elliss sent him flying through the air. Dart landed on the Giants' sideline.

The hit was deemed legal. Dart was still inbounds at the time of the hit. ""Guy made a good hit,"" he said.

Interim coach Mike Kafka didn't have any problem with the play from his quarterback. Even if it led to a big hit.

""Obviously, don't want him to take any hits that are unnecessary, but he was working his way out of bounds,"" Kafka said.

Tight end Theo Johnson immediately came in to defend his quarterback. He picked up a 15-yard penalty for unnecessary roughness on the play.

Dart's offensive line also came to protect him.

""We're not here to just get rolled over,"" right guard Greg Van Roten said. ""It's your quarterback. Especially if you think it's late, cheap or dirty, you let them know that's not acceptable. If they do s--- like that, we will respond accordingly.""

Dart said he didn't play any differently coming back from the concussion. He said playing safer wasn't running through his mind. The rookie first-round pick was just playing his game.

He was 17-of-24 passing for 139 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. He rushed four times for 20 yards and wasn't thrilled with the performance.

""Not good enough because we lost,"" Dart said.

It was the Giants' seventh straight loss. It was their 13th straight road defeat dating to last season.

Dart still insists he was his usual aggressive self Monday night. The Giants (2-11) even kept him in the game down three scores with just over two minutes left.

""Like I said, I played like this my whole life,"" Dart said. ""Turn on my high school tape, turn on my college tape, it's not a shocker to anybody. It's how I've played. I felt like if you just watch the game, like, I did slide. I did avoid a lot of hits, so you're going to get hit. It's football.""

The Giants did call the game Monday night a bit differently. In the game in which Dart was hurt last month, they used him on six designed runs. They didn't call any designed runs Monday.

Still, some of his teammates would rather him avoid the type of hit he took in the first quarter.

""I told him earlier [Monday], be smart, protect ourselves. Obviously, he's not going to listen because he's just so competitive, loves the contact,"" veteran offensive lineman Jon Runyan said. ""That's just how he is. We're just going to have to keep talking to him. Maybe he'll listen to us one of these days.""

Fortunately for Dart and the Giants, the quarterback said he felt good coming out of Monday night's game. He bounced back from the massive hit from Elliss and immediately jogged back to the huddle.

The play on which he suffered a concussion in Chicago and this hit in New England aren't going to alter his thinking.

""I got knocked out of the game against Chicago on a fluke play. You watch the hit, I lose control of the ball and I don't brace myself because I'm trying to re-catch the ball,"" Dart said. ""It's not because of the hit. It's because I lost the ball. So just like any other league, you take new steps, there's bigger, faster players. My body feels good. I'm going to play aggressive. I feel like if I just turn into a complete pocket passer, that's just not how I want to play the game. I feel like there's an advantage to me using my legs. So, yeah.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1202%2Fr1583620_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 19:59:47.212421

Lions defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard insisted Monday the normally jovial Joseph was in good spirts and excited to return to practice.
Before Monday, Joseph last practiced Oct. 3, two days before the Lions' Week 5 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.","Kerby Joseph was on top of the world.

A first-team All-Pro selection and the NFL's reigning interception leader, Joseph signed a four-year contract extension with the Detroit Lions in late April that made him the league's highest-paid safety.

Seven months later, there are serious questions about how much of that contract he'll see.

Joseph returned to practice on a limited basis Monday, Dec. 1, for the first time in nearly two months and addressed the knee injury that has kept him out the past six games in a brief and somber exchange with reporters.

Joseph, wearing a balaclava on his head that covered his mouth, talked for just under 2 minutes and replied to 14 questions with no answers of more than 11 words.

""My knee messed up,"" Joseph said.

Asked how he can fix it, Joseph said, ""You don’t fix it. You just keep the faith.""

Joseph missed time in training camp with a knee injury and suffered a bone bruise in the same spot in a Week 4 win over the Cleveland Browns.

Lions coach Dan Campbell said Sunday, Nov. 30, that Joseph was dealing with ""a little wear and tear"" in his knee in addition to the bone bruise, and indicated it could be a problem for years to come.

Joseph's injury is cartilage-related, a person familiar with the injury but not authorized to discuss it publicly, told the Free Press, and surgery is not currently considered an option.

""I don’t think it’s necessarily going away, but I think you do the best you can to manage it,"" Campbell said. ""It’s like a lot of these guys that have gotten some injuries here or deals with could be cartilage or meniscus or anything like that, it’s you do your best to manage it and there’ll always be a little wear and tear and it’s just how bad is it?""

Joseph, 25, said he felt ""blessed"" to be back at practice and vowed, ""If I’m out there I’m going to go 100%.""

But he did little to assuage concerns about the long-term health of his knee.

Joseph indicated the problem would not be fixed by offseason surgery, and when asked how worried he is he's dealing with a chronic issue, he said, ""Can’t be worried, I trust in God’s plan.""

When healthy, Joseph has been one of the most productive defensive backs in the NFL and a key part of the Lions defense.

A third-round pick out of Illinois in 2022, Joseph led the Lions with four interceptions in each of his first two seasons and had a career-high nine picks last year. He had three more interceptions during the Lions' 4-1 start this year, and still leads the team in that category despite last playing in a Week 6 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.

Lions defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard insisted Monday the normally jovial Joseph was in good spirts and excited to return to practice. Before Monday, Joseph last practiced Oct. 3, two days before the Lions' Week 5 win over the Cincinnati Bengals.

“Kerby’s doing great,"" Sheppard said. ""He’s ready to get back. He was as upbeat as I’ve ever seen him last week, leading into the week, knowing that he’s scratching and clawing, hopefully it’s a chance we get him back pretty soon here. But Kerby’s good, man.""

Joseph deleted his account on the social media platform X in recent days and erased pictures from his Instagram account. Early Monday morning, he posted a black screen with the words, ""God help me,"" in an Instagram story.

He said ""it's all God's plan"" when he'll return for game action, and said he took down some of his social media ""to lock in.""

Asked for what he was locking in on, Joseph said, ""Got to lock in on life.""","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/28/PDTF/86408209007-092825-lionsbrowns-1-h-039.jpg?crop=2669,1501,x0,y139&width=2669&height=1501&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-02 18:04:20.796193

Daniel Jones Jones is another quarterback with a bone injury, but his ailment involves his lower extremity.
Details surrounding the nature of Jones' fracture are limited, but the injury appeared to effect Jones' mobility in the loss to Houston.","Broken. Crack. Fracture. All these terms can be used interchangeably to describe damage to a bone. This week's NFL Injury Report is filled with players managing bone-related ailments. While these terms may be interchangeable the differences in fractures can be wide, as they may vary in cause, pattern of the break and other medical-related classifications. This degree of variability often dictates treatment options that in turn influences time lost. Let's take a look at several of these cases.

Justin Herbert

The Chargers quarterback suffered a broken hand in the team's win over the Raiders. The injury occurred to his left hand after he struck it on the helmet of Las Vegas safety Jeremy Chinn. He briefly left the game but returned to action with the hand casted and gloved. X-rays on the injury revealed a fractured metacarpal. The metacarpal bones are the bones that bridge the area between the wrist and fingers. The distal ends of the metacarpals form the knuckles of the fist. Herbert underwent surgery on Monday to repair the fracture site, suggesting the bone fragments displaced when they broke. Surgical hardware will stabilize the bone and help ensure the bones adequately fuse together during the healing process.

While it seems impossible to play football a week after surgery for a broken bone, Herbert could still play in Week 14. The medical staff will address any of Herbert's associated symptoms and then pad the area to protect it. Because the injury occurred to his non-throwing hand, the injury should not be functionally limiting. Furthermore, there have been other examples of players who underwent metacarpal fractures and did not miss time following surgery, including former NFL players DeMarco Murray and Terrell Owens. The Chargers have labeled Herbert as day-to-day, and he will get an extra day of recovery with the team playing Monday night. Hopefully we get a better idea of his availability before Sunday's slate of games, but he does appear to be trending in the right direction. Trey Lance will start if Herbert is unable to go.

While there is reason for optimism about Herbert's status, Rodgers is a good example of how a fracture can be limiting for a quarterback, even on a non-throwing hand. Rodgers' injury is multiple fractures in his wrist, though all the breaks were classified as nondisplaced, meaning surgery was not necessary. However, Rodgers did not look comfortable in his return to action, finishing 10-of-21 for 117 passings yards, with no touchdowns. He also fumbled early in the second half. Given the description, it remains likely Rogers' injury involves the distal ends of his lower arm bones or the tiny carpal bones. Without a specific diagnosis, it's hard to speculate how long the wrist will be a problem, but most bones take four to six weeks to heal completely. This process can be prolonged if the invovled bone is one that has a poor blood supply. Rodgers is expected to play in Week 14 despite also suffering a nasal laceration in the loss to the Bills, but it is worth exploring healthier options in all formats.

Daniel Jones

Jones is another quarterback with a bone injury, but his ailment involves his lower extremity. The Colts quarterback is reportedly playing with a broken fibula. The fibula is the smaller of the two lower leg bones and sits on the outside aspect of the leg. While the fibula is not considered a weight-bearing bone, it still plays a crucial role in stability and functional movement. Details surrounding the nature of Jones' fracture are limited, but the injury appeared to effect Jones' mobility in the loss to Houston. He had just one rush attempt for a single yard and he did not scramble out of the pocket. Jones will continue to play despite the injury, but those invested in the signal caller will need to appropriately adjust their expectations.

Omarion Hampton

The Chargers running back is working his way back from an ankle fracture that is believed to have involved the previously discussed fibula. Fibula fractures often accompany an ankle sprain, as a lateral malleolus fracture or an avulsion fracture can happen when a small piece of bone is pulled away from the fibula by a one of the ankle ligaments. Hampton has not played since suffering the injury in Week 5 but has entered his 21-day practice window after being sent to the injured reserve. He did not play against the Raiders but could be activated in time for Monday's game. Look for Los Angeles to split carries with Kimani Vidal as they look to ease Hampton back into the mix.

Turf Burns

Marvin Harrison: Harrison was unable to finish his first game back following his emergency appendectomy. The reason for his departure was not related to his previous surgery but instead a new heel injury. A heel injury could be a variety of things including a bruised fat pad, a bone contusion of the calcaneus, or a plantar fascia injury. The Cardinals did not provide much insight on the nature of the injury, but coach Jonathan Gannon did compare the problem to the heel injury that is currently sidelining Cardinals cornerback Max Melton. As a result, it seems likely Harrison will miss his third game in the last four contests. Michael Wilson will take over at the top of the Arizona depth chart.

Aaron Jones: The Vikings veteran running back is considered day-to-day with a shoulder injury sustained in the loss to the Seahawks. He was injured on a play that resulted in a fumble and was unable to return. The team did not reveal details about the injury, but reports have suggested it is not considered serious. Look for him to be limited throughout the week ahead, with Jordan Mason becoming an intriguing waiver wire addition if he is available.

Amon-Ra St. Brown: Brown made an early exit from Detroit's Thanksgiving Day loss to the Packers and was not at practice on Monday when the team began their preparation for Thursday's game against the Cowboys. St. Brown suffered an ankle sprain that coach Dan Campbell said could sideline him for at least one week. Fortunately, the ankle is not a high ankle sprain and not considered a long-term issue. He will be evaluated throughout the limited week ahead, but anyone rostering St. Brown should have an insurance policy readily available. Jameson Williams excelled after St. Brown went out, catching seven of his 10 targets for 144 yards and a touchdown. Isaac TeSlaa also benefited from the elevated role, catching two passes for 35 yards and a touchdown.","https://res.cloudinary.com/rotowire/image/upload/ar_16:7,c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,g_auto:custom_no_override,q_auto,w_800/eaiknkrbmpvvgqnikkcl.jpg",N,,2025-12-02 18:04:25.322602

The last time defensive tackle DeForest Buckner, cornerback Kenny Moore II and cornerback Charvarius Ward Sr. played together was late September. By the time Moore returned from an Achilles' injury sustained in that Week 3 win over the Tennessee Titans, Ward was on injured reserve with a concussion sustained during pre-game warmups ahead of Week 6. And when Ward made it back for the Colts' Week 12 game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Buckner was into his second of a minimum four games on injured reserve due to a neck injury.

Throw in the addition of cornerback Sauce Gardner ahead of Week 10, and now the calf injury he sustained early in Week 13, and the Colts have had to dip into their depth at some critical positions this season.

But that's the nature of the NFL, a league in which teams that handle attrition the best often have the best shot at contending.

""It's a part of our league,"" defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo said. ""It's a part of our league that every team has to deal with in one shape, form or fashion. So, you move on. ... I think the beauty of our place is we have depth and we trust the guys that are out there.""

At defensive tackle, Adetomiwa Adebawore has played at least 44 snaps in each of the Colts' last three games, which is a significant uptick for the 2023 fourth-round pick. He's generated 13 pressures in the last three games, per Pro Football Focus, tied with defensive end Laiatu Latu for the most on the Colts since Week 10. Veteran defensive tackle Neville Gallimore has seen his snap share tick up a bit without Buckner, too.

And at cornerback, the Colts looked to Jaylon Jones (31 snaps) and Mekhi Blackmon (46 snaps) to fill in for Gardner against the Texans.

Buckner is eligible – but not guaranteed – to come off injured reserve in Week 15, and while head coach Shane Steichen didn't have a timetable for Gardner's return, he said Monday injured reserve (which would sideline him for a minimum four games) was not something the Colts were considering.

Still, for Anarumo – and for most other coordinators around the NFL – the next few weeks will be about continuing to seek solutions on defense without key a key contributor or two for a critical stretch of the season.

""It's unfortunate with Sauce – play two, he goes down,"" Anarumo said. ""We certainly had some things cooked up, but you adjust. We have faith in the guys that are coming in the game with JJ (Jaylon Jones) and Mekhi, and you adjust when a guy like Buck goes down. So, I just think everybody in the league deals with injuries. We're no different. You just got to be able to adapt and overcome those things and try to do what the guys do best. It may change a little bit, but you try not to change the whole thing from a structural standpoint.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/rw9dn3wp5snize62r8bo,N,,2025-12-02 19:03:31.042253

Herbert Undergoes Hand Surgery

Justin Herbert had surgery in Los Angeles today to stabilize a fracture in his left hand. The Chargers say he is day-to-day and they will wait until later this week to decide if he can go against the Eagles Monday night. Herbert said the team is optimistic and reminded everyone that he is not a doctor. This is the second time in three seasons he has hurt the non-throwing hand, and the last time the Chargers leaned heavily on shotgun snaps to protect him. For fantasy purposes the real twist is Jim Harbaugh openly prepping Trey Lance for goal-line reps. Even if Herbert suits up there is a real chance Lance gets specialty work inside the 5, which would trim Herbert’s touchdown ceiling.

Amon-Ra Trending Toward Sitting

Amon-Ra St. Brown did not practice Monday because of his ankle injury. Most reports point to a one- or two-week timeline, which means a Thursday return against the Cowboys feels unlikely. A Monday DNP sets the tone. If he is out Jameson Williams becomes the only true volume option Detroit has and would step into a featured role for fantasy.

Kyren Williams Expected to Be Fine

Sean McVay said Williams looked pretty good after Sunday’s ankle scare. Williams exited the game then returned and still punched in a touchdown. He will probably land on the injury report but the fact that he already played through it keeps expectations high for Week 14. He remains a locked-in high-volume fantasy play.

Tee Higgins Still in Protocol

Zac Taylor confirmed Higgins is still working through concussion protocol. Higgins was hurt in Week 12, which gives him a chance to clear in time for this weekend. This will be a major storyline as most leagues head into a crucial final regular season matchup. When Higgins plays he brings strong WR2 value with touchdown upside.

Aaron Jones Sr. Avoids Major Injury

Jones is believed to be day to day after hurting his shoulder in Sunday’s loss to Seattle. He left in the third quarter and never returned but early reports suggest he dodged the worst outcomes. If he can go, he would face Washington in Week 14. If not, Jordan Mason becomes the favorite for early down work with Zavier Scott taking the passing game snaps. That combo would offer fringe flex value in deeper leagues.

McCarthy Could Return Against Washington

Kevin O’Connell said J.J. McCarthy has a chance to play next week as he works through concussion protocol. He can be cleared as early as Tuesday. The matchup with Washington is softer than the brutal run he just survived but the Vikings offense has been so inconsistent that neither he nor Max Brosmer can be trusted in superflex unless you are desperate.

Dan Quinn said Daniels has not yet been cleared for functional contact although he is ripping passes in practice. The team will wait until later in the week to decide his Week 14 status. Marcus Mariota could start again if Daniels is not ready. Mariota would be a viable superflex option in a favorable matchup while Daniels would jump right back into QB1 territory if he is cleared.

Drake London Has a Shot to Return

Raheem Morris said London has a chance to play this week after missing two games with a sprained PCL. He avoided injured reserve, which kept the door open for a quick return. We need to see him practice by Wednesday. If he is active, he immediately slides back into his usual target hog role.

Mike Evans Nearing Practice Activity

Todd Bowles said it is possible that Evans practices this week. Evans broke his collarbone in Week 7 and has missed about six weeks which lines up with early timelines. The Bucs would need to designate him for return before he can officially practice, which would then start a 21-day evaluation window. Tampa is 7-5 and fighting for playoff positioning so Evans’ return would be massive. He is not guaranteed to play soon, but the arrow is finally pointing up.

Kyler Murray Will Not Be Activated This Week

Jonathan Gannon said the Cardinals will not open Murray’s return window. Murray has not played since Week 5 and eventually lost the job to Jacoby Brissett. With the Cardinals playing out the string and facing major decisions on Murray’s future there is no urgency to bring him back. We’re headed toward a divorce in the offseason.

Jayden Reed Still Waiting on Clearance

Matt LaFleur said Reed still needs final medical clearance before he can return. Reed has been practicing since the team opened his return window, but they have not yet pulled the trigger on activating him. Reed broke his collarbone in Week 2 and has barely played this season. If activated he would likely be eased back into the rotation.

MarShawn Lloyd Designated for Return

The Packers designated Lloyd for return from injured reserve. Lloyd has yet to play a snap this season because of a hamstring injury and has only appeared in one game since being drafted last year. Even if he is activated, he projects to sit behind Josh Jacobs and Emanuel Wilson, which makes him a deep stash only in dynasty formats.

That wraps up today’s Daily Dive. Herbert’s hand. Amon-Ra’s ankle. A bunch of players on the verge of returning. Fantasy managers need to stay sharp this week because playoff berths are on the line everywhere.",https://dmxvtdt4jwgem.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Amon-Ra-St.-Brown-vs-KC.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 18:04:30.986941

He is a generational talent; he really helps our offense and is kind of the heartbeat of our offense.","Standout right tackle Luke Goedeke has cemented himself as a pillar on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offensive line after returning from injury. Goedeke aggravated a foot injury in Week Two against the Houston Texans, after suffering the initial injury in the season opener. He was placed on injured reserve on September 18 and missed six games.

Just prior to the start of the 2025 regular season, Goedeke signed a four-year contract extension, rewarding his contributions on the field. Originally a second-round selection out of Central Michigan in the 2022 NFL Draft, he served as the starting left guard for the first half of his rookie campaign before being moved to his natural spot at right tackle in the last game of the season. After undergoing a learning curve during his first year facing a hellacious gauntlet of talented three-techniques, Goedeke won the starting job at right tackle in 2023 and has formed a stout tandem with linemate Tristan Wirfs. Deemed the ""enforcer"" by teammates in the run game, Goedeke sets the tone.

""It is part of shaping me into who I am,"" reflected Goedeke. ""It just made me battle-tested for future adversity that I may face. It feels like it was so long ago. Just looking back on it, that was four years ago. Time in the NFL flies…It is night and day difference.""

Goedeke can play low to high with a good center of gravity and he has outstanding athleticism at the second level to create seams for rushers. He generates power from his lower body and packs a lethal punch on initial contact. Goedeke plays with a fiery competitive disposition and moves opponents off their spot. He is effective on pulls with smooth footwork and has the anchor to counter bull rushes. Against the Cardinals in Week 13, Goedeke played a pivotal role in opening lanes for Bucky Irving and extending blocks when quarterback Baker Mayfield scrambled.

""He has the dawg in him for sure,"" said Goedeke of Mayfield during the Players’ Table Show. ""He will die on the sword out there for us or on a shield out there for us. Throughout the week, I think we were all kind of a little unsure, asking, 'Is Baker going to play this week?' So, when we knew that he would play eventually, it was a big sigh of relief. He is a generational talent; he really helps our offense and is kind of the heartbeat of our offense. To have him out there, it gives you a sigh of relief, just a lot more comfortable with him out there as well.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/buccaneers/moaakcsso02q2vdp50qo,N,,2025-12-02 17:03:43.852171

Daniels has made slow-but-steady progress in his attempt to return from a dislocated left elbow. The second-year quarterback returned to the practice field ahead of Week 13. He hasn't yet been cleared for contact, but once he is, he may have a chance to return to that lineup.

Naturally, if Daniels is able to return, the NFL's reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year would provide Washington's offense a boost. It would also mark an improbably short comeback from an injury that many initially feared would knock him out for the season.

Here are the latest injury updates about Daniels and his status for Week 14 and the rest of the 2025 NFL season.

When will Jayden Daniels return?

The Commanders have not provided a definite timeline for Daniels' return. His status for Week 14 remains in question, as Washington coach Dan Quinn revealed during a Nov. 1 media availability the second-year quarterback had not yet been cleared for contact.

""He's still going through that process of the functional testing,"" Quinn told reporters. ""I'll have a better sense as we go through the week.""

Quinn then told reporters the team wouldn't have a concrete update on whether Daniels will potentially be able to play the team's Week 14 game against the Minnesota Vikings until Friday.

Daniels originally returned to the practice field ahead of Washington's Week 12 game against the Denver Broncos. Quinn made it clear the 24-year-old was ""unlikely to play"" but characterized his participation as a good sign.

""Man, it's good to get started and get the return to play going,"" Quinn said at a Nov. 24 media availability. ""That's a big deal for us.""

Quinn has made it clear he believes ""it's important"" for Daniels to play again in 2025, if he's healthy enough to do so. The second-year quarterback is in agreement with his coach.

""If I'm healthy, and I'm ready to go, I want to be out there,"" Daniels told reporters on Nov. 25.

Who is Commanders backup QB?

Marcus Mariota is the Commanders' backup quarterback and has temporarily replaced Daniels in the starting lineup.

Mariota, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Oregon, has posted a 1-5 record across six starts in place of Daniels. The 32-year-old has completed 63.2% of his passes for 1,359 passing yards, nine passing touchdowns and six interceptions while adding 248 yards and a score on the ground.

Mariota has a 35-45 career record across 80 starts. Before the 2025 season, he had not started an NFL game since he went 5-8 across 13 starts with the Atlanta Falcons in 2022.

Commanders QB depth chart

Daniels is one of four quarterbacks in the Washington organization. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

Jayden Daniels (injured)

Marcus Mariota

Josh Johnson

Sam Hartman (practice squad)

Johnson, 39, has backed up Mariota in Daniels' absence. The veteran has played for an NFL record 14 different teams since being selected in the fifth round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He has a career record of 1-8 and last made a start for the Baltimore Ravens in 2021.

Hartman signed with the Commanders as an undrafted free agent out of Notre Dame in 2024.

Only Hendrickson knows how serious that is, and nobody on the Bengals’ staff can truly determine his pain level; they can only ask.","We are now 37 days removed from the last time Trey Hendrickson touched the football field for the Cincinnati Bengals, going down before halftime against the New York Jets on Oct. 26.

Twice in a three-game span, he attempted to come back from an injury that’s been listed as back, hip and pelvis and described as a sports hernia and “core muscle injury” over the course of the season. By any name, the ailment kept him from making it to the second half of either game without reaggravation ending his day.

The Bengals didn’t put their $30 million edge rusher on injured reserve, rather leaving the door open for his return every week.

At every Monday news conference since the injury, coach Zac Taylor has called Hendrickson “out” or “doubtful” before any hope could be mustered to even entertain a comeback to a defense in dire need of pressure off the edge.

Taylor did the same this Monday in advance of Sunday’s critical game in Buffalo, adding an underlying exasperation to his latest “week-to-week” explanation of Hendrickson’s future return possibilities.

When asked whether Hendrickson is still working behind the scenes in meetings, as normally associated with injured players, Taylor said, “mostly rehab stuff with trainers.” Not exactly a ringing endorsement.

Will he be back this season?

“We’ll just keep taking it week-to-week,” Taylor said.

All this leads to a murky, $30 million question: What exactly is going on with Hendrickson these days?

The Bengals could use extra juice in their pass rush, even if only in a subpackage of plays in high-leverage situations. Instead, those are going to 2024 sixth-round pick Cedric Johnson.

Hendrickson last spoke on the record with the media on the Monday before the trade deadline. When asked specifically about speculation that he is not playing because of his expiring contract at the end of the season and potentially lucrative free agency, he merely pointed out he wouldn’t be rushing himself back early.

“I can’t control what people’s evaluations and questions of me are,” Hendrickson said on Nov. 3. “I can only say that I have a standard for my play and I think they have a standard for their recovery process. The Jets game was a little early, in hindsight. Having unfortunate setbacks like that are kind of annoying. This is uncharted territory for me over the last four years. Navigating these will be a day-to-day process in figuring out when it is best and when the time is to get back to doing what I love.”

If there had been a diagnosis that Hendrickson would not be able to return in the following four weeks, Cincinnati could have placed him on injured reserve, saved the roster spot it has needed amid a roster crunch in recent weeks, and waited for Hendrickson to recover before clearing him back for practice.

None of that happened. Instead, every week he’s immediately ruled doubtful or out for that week’s game. Hendrickson didn’t travel with the team to Baltimore last week.

Hendrickson says he doesn’t want to have setbacks or play at a level below his highest standard. There are obvious reasons for him to have that stance rather than putting a lesser version of himself on tape as the league judges his worth.

The current view is that Hendrickson belongs among the league’s best. He led the NFL in sacks last season, finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting, racked up 39 sacks over his last 41 games and has been selected to four consecutive Pro Bowls.

Age and health will be the only factors held against an otherwise unassailable resume. He turns 31 on Friday and will hit free agency in March as one of the top players available, assuming he doesn’t receive the franchise tag. He’s played at least 15 games in all four seasons with the Bengals before this year.

“This is new territory for me,” Hendrickson said last month. “Navigating these waters of being tough but being smart is a new challenge. I am embracing this challenge; it’s different and new. I love these guys, that’s the unfortunate thing.”

This comes at the same time when an outpouring of love and admiration has been directed toward fellow captain Joe Burrow, who worked his way back a month ahead of schedule and played with special protection in the cleat to limit exposure to his left foot in an attempt to return to the field despite dwindling playoff hopes.

Coaches and players have pointed to Burrow’s willingness to play despite the pain and small chance of reaching the postseason as an inspiration for their effort. That showed in the 32-14 upset of the Ravens on Thanksgiving.

There’s always going to be a level of pain to play through and tolerance to consider when returning from any injury. Only Hendrickson knows how serious that is, and nobody on the Bengals’ staff can truly determine his pain level; they can only ask.

It’s created a confusing situation, to be sure. There is no injured reserve trip coming, which suggests a return could be soon, but instead, Hendrickson keeps being immediately declared doubtful at the start of every week. Nothing sounds imminent or shows signs of progress.

All that’s known is Hendrickson won’t be playing in Buffalo, and if the Bengals can’t find a way to beat the Bills, there likely won’t be any 2025 team goals that warrant a return to the field for the Bengals’ star edge rusher.

That trend continued Tuesday, as second-year cornerback Terrion Arnold will reportedly miss the rest of the 2025 NFL season due to shoulder surgery, according to NFL Network.

After an uneven rookie season, which earned Arnold some down-ballot Rookie of the Year award votes, the 22-year-old corner has had trouble staying on the field in Year 2. Arnold originally sustained a shoulder injury in Week 5. At the time, Lions head coach Dan Campbell expressed concern, saying Arnold could be ""out a long time"" due to the issue.

But the Lions got better news than expected after further evaluation. Arnold missed a few weeks before returning to action in Week 9. That return was short-lived, as Arnold sustain a concussion the following week, preventing him from playing in the Lions' next two contests.

He returned to face the division-rival Green Bay Packers on Thanksgiving, but played just 18 snaps in the contest. Arnold recorded four tackles during the game.

On Monday, the team may have shed some light on Arnold's limited playing time in that contest, placing the second-year corner on Injured Reserve due to a shoulder injury. While that move left open the possibility Arnold could return if the team made a run in the postseason, Tuesday's report suggests that won't be the case. Arnold will reportedly miss the rest of the year due to season-ending surgery.

The Lions expected big things from Arnold when the team selected him with the No. 24 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. He experienced an up and down rookie year, allowing a 99.2 passer rating on balls thrown his way as a rookie, per SI.com.

Arnold didn't do much to prove himself in Year 2, though injuries clearly played a role in his less than stellar metrics. PFF grades Arnold as the 91st best cornerback in the NFL this season.

Despite his on-field struggles, Arnold's injury comes at a tough time for the Lions. The team briefly thought it was going to get standout center Frank Ragnow to come out of retirement for the stretch run, but the veteran failed his physical due to a hamstring injury and won't play in 2025. The team could also be without standout tight end Sam LaPorta, who underwent back surgery ahead of the team's Thanksgiving game against the Packers. Campbell said LaPorta would likely miss the rest of the season due to the issue.

Under Campbell's watch, the Lions have transformed from bottom feeder to one of the best teams in the NFL. Despite some lofty regular-season win totals, however, the Lions have yet to reach the Super Bowl under Campbell.

Even without some key players, the Lions are talented enough to rally down the stretch and emerge as a legitimate contender.

PFF's fantasy football recap focuses on player usage and stats, breaking down all the vital information you need to achieve fantasy success in 2025.

New York Giants @ New England Patriots

Rhamondre Stevenson starts for the Patriots: TreVeyon Henderson had been the primary running back for New England in each of the past four games.

New England started the season with a three-man rotation between Stevenson, Henderson and Antonio Gibson. Gibson suffered a season-ending injury, which seemed to open the door for both Stevenson and Henderson to see more playing time, but instead, Stevenson played more than 70% of the snaps from Weeks 6–8. Stevenson missed Weeks 9–11 because of an injury, during which Henderson made several big plays, running 47 times for 264 yards and four touchdowns while catching 10 passes for 66 yards and a touchdown.

Stevenson returned last week, but Henderson remained the starter. Stevenson’s primary role was as a third-down back. Henderson ran 18 times for 66 yards and caught three passes for 15 yards. He has been held under 4.0 yards per carry in three of his four games as a starter.

This week, Stevenson was back to being the lead back in all situations. Henderson rotated in more frequently than he did in Weeks 6–8, but this still marked a significant decrease for him. Henderson averaged more yards per carry, while Stevenson was more effective as a receiver, helped by a 36-yard reception.

The Patriots have their bye next week and close out the fantasy season against the Buffalo Bills, Baltimore Ravens and New York Jets. The Bills and Jets are two of the top five teams in allowing fantasy points to running backs. Henderson is no longer a top-10 must-start option, but he can likely stay in fantasy lineups with those matchups. This also makes Stevenson a potential fantasy starter in those games.

Stefon Diggs plays a smaller role: The former All-Pro wide receiver played less than 50% of his team’s snaps for the second straight game.

The Patriots have stayed relatively healthy at wide receiver this season, outside of Kayshon Boutte missing a few games. They used a heavy rotation at the position through the first nine weeks, with Boutte playing 66.6% of snaps, Mack Hollins 60.9%, Diggs 55.4%, DeMario Douglas 30.3% and Kyle Williams 20.9%. The first four receivers all played more than 50% of snaps in 11 personnel, while Boutte and Hollins led the way in 12 personnel. Diggs played the second-most snaps in 11 personnel at 78.2% and the third-most snaps in two-receiver sets at 41.9%.

Boutte returned last week, and New England shifted its wide receiver strategy. Hollins and Boutte both saw their roles increase, each playing more than 80% of snaps. That included both playing more than 94% of snaps in 11 personnel and at least 87% in 12 personnel. This left Diggs playing 78.4% of snaps in 11 personnel but just one snap in 12 personnel.

This week, he played more in 12 personnel but was rotated out more often in 11 personnel than in any other game this season. Douglas was the one rotating with Diggs. While Diggs entered the week leading the team in yards per route run at 2.35, Douglas wasn’t far behind at 2.20, and Douglas’ separation numbers have been more impressive this season. Douglas narrowed the YPRR gap with three receptions for 33 yards, while Diggs caught three passes for 26 yards.

The Patriots have their bye week, then two favorable matchups in their final three games, but it will be very difficult to trust Diggs in those games, given his current role in the offense.

Monitor Tyrone Tracy Jr.’s health: Tracy suffered a hip injury in the fourth quarter and didn’t return.

Tracy has been the Giants' lead running back over the past four weeks since Cam Skattebo suffered a season-ending injury. He has played 59.5% of snaps, while Devin Singletary has played 40.8%. Those tendencies held on both early downs and third downs. Tracy had taken 100% of the late-down snaps, while Singletary had 84.4% of the short-yardage and goal-line snaps. This has given Tracy more fantasy value thanks to increased rushing and receiving production, but the gap between them hasn’t been large because Singletary has scored two goal-line touchdowns.

Tracy took all eight snaps on the first two drives, which was a change from the previous four games, as Singletary had always gotten involved early. Tracy ran the ball twice for gains of 1 yard and 2 yards. Singletary took over on the third drive and had runs of 6 and 8 yards among his first three carries. That success earned him another drive, where he continued to string together solid runs. He finished the first half with nine carries for 40 yards, while Tracy had only the two early runs.

Tracy started the second half, but the Giants were down by 23 points. He found some success early in the half, but it was too late for him to have a big game after the missed time in the first half. Singletary’s touchdowns this season have generally come on goal-line carries, but he took a direct snap for a 22-yard touchdown to open the fourth quarter. Tracy suffered a hip injury in the fourth quarter and was carted to the locker room. Singletary took over as the lead running back for the remainder of the game.

The Giants have their bye week next week and close the fantasy season with games against the Washington Commanders, Minnesota Vikings and Las Vegas Raiders. Singletary becomes a clear waiver-wire target if Tracy’s injury turns out to be serious. He would likely play more than 70% of snaps in those three games, and that is a top-10 schedule for running backs over that stretch.

Miscellaneous Notes

New England’s third-string running back and returner, Terrell Jennings, suffered a head injury on an early special teams play and was ruled out before halftime.

Patriots wide receiver Efton Chism III was back in the lineup after being a healthy inactive last week. He played five games from Week 6 to 11, primarily playing on special teams as a kick returner.

Patriots tight end Hunter Henry was limited in practice on Thursday with a toe injury.

New England tight end C.J. Dippre couldn't play due to a back injury, his second straight absence. New England had only two active tight ends, rather than finding a replacement for Dippre.

Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart was active this week after missing the last two games with a concussion. He practiced in full this week.

Wide receivers Wan’Dale Robinson (ankle) and Darius Slayton (hamstring) were limited in practice to start the week, but were able to practice in full by Saturday.

The Giants haven’t had much consistency at wide receiver from one week to the next, but this was the second straight week with Robinson as the top receiver, with Slayton and Isaiah Hodgins as the other primary receivers. The Giants used more 11 personnel than usual, leading both Slayton and Hodgins to see more playing time than in other recent weeks.

Fourth wide receiver Gunner Olszewski suffered a concussion on a second-quarter kick return and didn’t return.

The Giants activated wide receiver Dalen Cambre from the practice squad for this game on Monday.

New York wide receiver Jalin Hyatt was a healthy scratch. He was active last week, but didn’t play an offensive snap. He’s caught five passes for 35 yards this season.

Table notes

Snaps include plays called back due to penalties, including offensive holding or defensive pass interference. The other three stats have these plays removed.

Targets may differ from official NFL sources. The most likely discrepancy would be from a clear thrown-away pass, where the NFL may give the target to the nearest receiver, while this data will not.",https://media.pff.com/2025/12/Stefon-Diggs-Kyle-Williams-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675,N,,2025-12-02 15:02:46.952345

“It’s an opportunity to step up and see if I can put the big-boy pants on and do a job for us,” Schneider said.
We’ve got to show our best.” Rangers seeking ‘assertive play’ from Morrow Rookie Scott Morrow will also be called upon to help fill the void left by Fox’s injury.
“Assertive play,” Sullivan said.
Eliminating hesitation from his game.” Morrow acknowledged as much, noting “defensive reads” as the main area where he needs to show improvement.","TARRYTOWN, N.Y. — Braden Schneider has earned more and more trust from his coaches in each season of his NHL career. This year, Mike Sullivan has played the New York Rangers defenseman in what the coach called “a pretty elevated role” for an average of 18 minutes, 27 seconds per game, up from 17:52 last season.

With No. 1 defenseman Adam Fox out multiple weeks with a left shoulder injury, Schneider will be tested even more. The void presents a chance for the 24-year-old. The Rangers have held him in high regard since drafting him with the No. 19 pick in 2020, but he has yet to fully break out in a top-four role.

“It’s an opportunity to step up and see if I can put the big-boy pants on and do a job for us,” Schneider said.

Schneider moved into Fox’s spot on the top pair at practice Monday, lining up alongside left-side defenseman Vladislav Gavrikov. Sullivan said that the Rangers will have to replace Fox’s ice time by committee. Schneider, though, might see the biggest uptick in responsibility of any New York defenseman, set to play more minutes and face stiffer competition. He’s currently fifth among New York defensemen in quality of offensive opponent, according to Hockey Stat Cards, which uses colleague Dom Luszczyszyn’s Net Rating model. Gavrikov, meanwhile, leads New York’s defensemen in the metric.

“I’ve got to expect to play fast with (Gavrikov), to play hard defense with him and to try to create in the o-zone with him when we can,” Schneider said. “I think if we can be a good stalwart pair and play fast and get pucks in our forwards’ hands, I think we can be effective.”

Carson Soucy and Will Borgen, who remain the team’s second pair, will also likely have to take on tougher matchups. The Matthew Robertson-Scott Morrow third pair has a combined 40 games of NHL experience, and Sullivan has shown some hesitance to rely on Morrow early this season.

The Rangers count on Schneider much more for his defense than his offense. He has a 1.0 defensive rating, per Hockey Stat Cards, but a minus-3.2 rating on offense. In 27 games, he has five points. Schneider knows he’s not Fox offensively — “obviously we’re not going to fill that hole that he brings,” he said — but he believes he can chip in offense in more simple ways.

“For me, offense is kind of a byproduct of good defense,” Schneider said. “I’ve just got to make sure I’m doing the job physically. I’m a physical leader on this team. If I can bring that and get the pucks in our forwards’ hands, that’s my main objective.”

He also noted the importance of getting pucks through to the net. Sullivan said he needs the Gavrikov-Schneider pair to defend hard and be efficient with the puck. He doesn’t want them to change the way they play and hunt for offense with Fox out.

“I think that’s the game that they play when they’re at their best,” Sullivan said.

“We’ll try to bring our ‘A’ game,” Gavrikov added. “It’s really important right now, especially in our situation. We’ve got to be productive. We’ve got to show our best.”

Rangers seeking ‘assertive play’ from Morrow

Rookie Scott Morrow will also be called upon to help fill the void left by Fox’s injury.

The 23-year-old is a 2021 second-round pick who was part of the package the Rangers acquired in the July 1 trade that sent former top-four staple K’Andre Miller to the Carolina Hurricanes. He was an AHL All-Star last season and has a reputation as an offensive defenseman dating back to his days at the University of Massachusetts, but he was cut toward the end of his first training camp with New York and clearly has work to do to earn Sullivan’s trust.

The coach was upfront about that when asked what he needs to see from Morrow.

“Assertive play,” Sullivan said. “Making decisions with conviction and not being in between. Eliminating hesitation from his game.”

Morrow acknowledged as much, noting “defensive reads” as the main area where he needs to show improvement.

“Every defenseman who’s young kind of screws up from time to time and maybe misplaces situations,” he said. “I mean, hockey’s a very fluid game. You never really encounter the exact same situation twice, so it’s just getting those reps in my own zone, playing the rush, and just trying to learn from the things I do well and don’t do well. I watch some of the great guys on our team and just continue to hammer away at that. Be a little bit more physical. I know that’s something that the whole team’s trying to harp on right now, so if I can bring some more of that, too, that’d be big.”

Sullivan limited Morrow to a modest average of 13:37 time on ice in his first four NHL appearances of the season, which have been scattered around 12 AHL games with the Hartford Wolf Pack. Morrow called the back-and-forth “a little challenging” but said he’s feeling more comfortable lately.

The Darien, Conn., native will remain in a sheltered role in Fox’s absence, at least to start. He spent Monday’s practice skating on the bottom pair alongside Robertson while quarterbacking the second power-play unit. The Rangers are understandably hesitant to thrust a player who’s had defensive growing pains into a spot that would require tougher matchups, but with Fox expected to miss multiple weeks, there’s a runway for Morrow to prove he’s ready to take on more.

There isn’t one player who can replace Fox, but no defenseman on the roster is as similar in terms of skill set. Morrow is a right-handed shooter who’s capable of transporting pucks and creating offense, which the Rangers sorely need. Now, it’s a matter of seizing the opportunity without overthinking it.

“You’ve got to take it defense-first, and add offense wherever you can,” he said. “In the past in Carolina, there were times where I tried to force the offense – especially if it’s the third period, and you’re like, ‘Oh, I might not get another shift unless I make a play here.’ Things like that. Foxy is on LTIR. If I get in a spot where I’m not worrying about being in the lineup or getting another shift, I think it’ll ease my mind a bit. I’ll be able to settle in and kind of just play the game and let the game come to me, instead of trying to force things.”

Sullivan trying five forwards on PP1

With Morrow not on the top power-play unit, Sullivan went with a five-forward arrangement in practice Monday: Artemi Panarin in Fox’s typical spot as quarterback with Mika Zibanejad, Vincent Trocheck, J.T. Miller and Will Cuylle in front of him. Asked why he didn’t go with a defenseman — likely Morrow, Gavrikov or Schneider — running the power play as most units do, Sullivan said, “We don’t think that’s the strength of their games to this point.”

The coach also used six forwards when New York tried to score at six-on-five late in the Tampa Bay game.

Panarin said playing the point is “not really new” for him. He and Fox sometimes switched spots as power plays unfolded, and he likes the position because it allows him to play with the puck more and use his vision.

“It’s probably the best position to see the ice because you can go on both sides,” he said. “On the ice, it shows everything.”

New York’s power play has been getting results lately. It is up to 12th in the NHL with a 21.3 percent conversion rate and is nine for its past 25 (36 percent success rate). Losing Fox will be a major adjustment, though the unit should remain dangerous with Panarin at the point.

Sullivan knows a five-forward power play comes with defensive risks. Opponents, starting with Dallas on Tuesday, could look to be opportunistic shorthanded against forwards not as comfortable defending while skating backwards.

“We’re going to see how it plays out,” Sullivan said. “Obviously, we need to have some conscience on the power play with five forwards, without a doubt. And that’s a conversation that we’ll have.”

“I have to play a little safer up top, but I also can’t be too conservative,” Panarin added. “It won’t work like that. The NHL isn’t an easy league. You have to take risks.”

Notes

• Though defensive pairings drew much of the attention at Monday’s practice, Sullivan’s quest to find the right combinations for his top-six forward group is ongoing. He’s rearranged several times in recent weeks, with Monday featuring another new look. Panarin joined Zibanejad and Alexis Lafrenière on the top line, while Miller shifted to Trocheck’s left wing. Jonny Brodzinski was elevated to play right wing next to those two, while Cuylle dropped down to the third line with Noah Laba and Brett Berard.

“We’re looking for chemistry,” Sullivan explained when asked Saturday about all the juggling. “We’re looking for traction, consistency of play, all of those things. When we get it, we’ll stay with it. We’ve moved people around. There’s been people injured also. That’s been part of it. J.T. was out for a period of time. Troch was out for a bunch of games. That changes the dynamic a lot. Ideally, we’d like to settle into some consistent combinations and then build. But we just haven’t found a comfort level at this point where we see the elements that I’m talking about.”

• The Rangers called up goaltender Dylan Garand to back up Igor Shesterkin when Jonathan Quick went down with a lower-body injury, but Sullivan didn’t use him in the team’s three games last week. Notably, the coach played Shesterkin in the Boston and Tampa Bay games on back-to-back days. The team sent Garand back to AHL Hartford after the Lightning game and brought up Spencer Martin, who was at practice Monday. Martin started the year with CSKA Moscow in the KHL, then signed a two-year deal with the Rangers midseason. He was still wearing his KHL mask at Monday’s practice.

• Adam Edström left practice early Monday with a lower-body injury. Sullivan didn’t have a further update after the skate. Taylor Raddysh, meanwhile, missed practice for personal reasons.

• With Edström considered day-to-day and Raddysh’s status uncertain, the Rangers recalled forward Brennan Othmann from Hartford on Monday evening. The 22-year-old appeared in one previous NHL game this season on Oct. 26 against the Calgary Flames, but a couple defensive miscues resulted in a quick hook and eventual reassignment to the AHL.

“Well, he’s not out for the year, but this is a very significant injury,” Breer said while appearing on NBC Sports Boston’s pregame coverage. “He has a Grade 3 MCL sprain. That essentially means his MCL is torn. It’s a four-to-six week injury.”

Breer said the Patriots placed Campbell on injured reserve to ensure he doesn’t try to rush himself back. It’s the type of injury that you can aggravate and make worse by playing on it, after all.

“One of the reasons they decided to put him on injured reserve was actually to protect him from himself,” Breer said. “They felt like because of who he is, how tough he is, the sort of competitor he is, he would push to get back earlier than that. So, this puts a governor on it. This forces him to go through a full recovery. They’re going to try to get him back for the last game of the regular season, but even that may be pushing it a little bit.

Coach Kevin Stefanski made the announcement Monday that Collins will have to undergo season-ending surgery.

The 10-year veteran defensive lineman sustained the non-contact injury during the third quarter. He was second on the team with 6 1/2 sacks along with 28 quarterback pressures.

Collins is also a key reason why All-Pro pass rusher Myles Garrett needs four sacks to break the NFL's single-season record of 22 1/2.

“When you lose a guy like Maliek, you don’t replace him. He’s made a big impact on this football team on the field and off,"" Stefanski said.

""We have some older guys in there (the defensive line room), but we have a bunch of young guys in there. I think they’ve learned a lot from the professional that Maliek is and I think you have to carry that with you throughout.”

Collins' injury with 9:36 remaining in the third quarter also set off a fracas between some of the Browns defensive linemen and San Francisco wide receiver Jauan Jennings. Garrett and Shelby Harris said some of Jennings' comments after the play crossed the line.

Harris didn't hide his feelings about Jennings after Sunday's game.

“He says some things that you should not say to another man, ever,” Harris said. “But I don’t respect it because you say that, then run behind your O-line. That’s some real soft (stuff), and I want that known.

“I see exactly why they punched your (groin). I’m surprised nobody punched him in the jaw yet.”

It was the second straight game Jennings drew the ire of opposing defenses. Carolina safety Tre’von Moehrig was suspended one game without pay after punching Jennings during the fourth quarter of last Monday's game.

Moehrig said he punched Jennings because of continuing physical play after the whistle and trash-talking throughout the game. Jennings walked over to Moehrig after the game, shoved and punched him in the face before both players were separated.

Jennings was fined $12,172 by the league for the punch.

Garrett said he was trying to separate everybody and find out what the problem was, before Jennings started coming at him.

“He had a lot to say that was demeaning and disparaging toward some of our players. ... I mean, some guys just roll like that,” Garrett said. ""I don’t feel like that belongs in the game. But, hey, if that works for him and them, then more power to him.""

Stefanski didn't have any comments about what occurred, saying he was focused on Collins' injury and not what was happening elsewhere on the field.

San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan said on Monday that it was his understanding Jennings' comments were not about Collins, who played for the 49ers last season.

“It just sounded like there were players standing around for a while because of the injury and then they got chirping at each other. I don’t know what words were said, but it sounded like he offended some guys with the words,” Shanahan said. “I’d have to hear it to have an opinion on it. I haven’t heard what he said that offended them so much. Until I do, I don’t have much of an opinion on it. That’s just trash talk between a couple of people out on the field and I kind of leave it at that.”

Shanahan also defended Jennings' playing style despite him getting under the skin of his opponents the past couple of games.

“I think Jauan plays to the whistle as well as any player in this league. He’s extremely aggressive and plays as hard as he can to the whistle and he’s been doing that as Niner fans know and you guys know since he’s been here,” he said. “I think sometimes that offends other players and rubs people the wrong way because they’re not used to people going that hard to the whistle. But I think what JJ is very good at is not breaking rules.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/maeilek-collins-browns-AP-25335707372508,N,,2025-12-02 17:03:50.071995

,,2025-12-02 15:15:59+00:00,NFL.com,Giants QB Jaxson Dart won't change his style: Big hits 'just part of the game' - NFL.com,Kevin Patra,,,,,https://www.nfl.com/news/giants-qb-jaxson-dart-won-t-change-his-style-big-hits-just-part-of-the-game,"""Look, like, I understand the question, but this is football,"" Dart said following the 33-15 loss, via the team's official transcript.
The Giants' dynamic young quarterback was hit often Monday night, taking two sacks and the Pats picked up seven QB hits on 24 pass attempts.
Dart was adamant that he doesn't need to change his style, nor is he willing to consider that approach for fear it would hinder his game.
I feel like if I just turn into a complete pocket passer, that's just not how I want to play the game.
Interim coach Mike Kafka didn't scrutinise the play from his quarterback, even the big hits.","Missing two games due to a concussion isn't going to alter Jaxson Dart's game.

The rookie returned to the lineup Monday night against the New England Patriots, and almost immediately got blasted. During a first-quarter scamper up the sideline, Dart declined to step out of bounds, got lit up by Christian Elliss, and was sent flying into the bench area. It was a legal hit, but Dart's teammates took exception, with tight end Theo Johnson getting flagged for unnecessary roughness.

""Look, like, I understand the question, but this is football,"" Dart said following the 33-15 loss, via the team's official transcript. ""Like, I'm going to get hit if I'm in the pocket or outside the pocket. I feel like I played this way my whole entire life. It shouldn't be any shocker to anybody if you followed along with my career. We're not playing soccer out here. You're going to get hit. Things happen. It's just part of the game.""

Dart added that the hit ""didn't hurt, so that didn't play any thought in my mind.""

The Giants' dynamic young quarterback was hit often Monday night, taking two sacks and the Pats picked up seven QB hits on 24 pass attempts. Dart also ran four times for 20 yards. He finished 17 of 24 passing for 139 yards with one touchdown toss.

The quarterback has been a breath of fresh air for a franchise that has lived in the cellar much of the past decade. However, there is concern that his style of play won't afford him a long career. He's been checked for concussions in multiple games this season before missing the past two tilts while in the league's procotol.

Dart was adamant that he doesn't need to change his style, nor is he willing to consider that approach for fear it would hinder his game.

""My body feels good. I got knocked out of the game against Chicago on a fluke play,"" he said. ""You watch the hit, I lose control of the ball and I don't brace myself because I'm trying to re-catch the ball. It's not because of the hit. It's because I lost the ball. So just like any other league, you take new steps, there's bigger, faster players. My body feels good. I'm going to play aggressive. I feel like if I just turn into a complete pocket passer, that's just not how I want to play the game. I feel like there's an advantage to me using my legs.""

Interim coach Mike Kafka didn't scrutinise the play from his quarterback, even the big hits.

""Obviously, don't want him to take any hits that are unnecessary, but he was working his way out of bounds,"" Kafka said.

Dart insisted that he doesn't need to change how he plays, noting that he did slide on several runs.

""Like I said, I played like this my whole life,"" he said. ""Turn on my high school tape, turn on my college tape, it's not a shocker to anybody. It's how I've played. I felt like if you just watch the game, like, I did slide. I did avoid a lot of hits, so you're going to get hit. It's football.""

Yet, NFL players are bigger, faster, stronger than anything Dart has faced, even during his SEC days.

It's natural for a player to want to hang on to an aspect of his game that makes him dynamic. But growth and development in avoiding big hits are needed to ensure he's not a flash in the pan, like so many other quarterbacks before him.

""I told him earlier [Monday], be smart, protect ourselves. Obviously, he's not going to listen because he's just so competitive, loves the contact,"" Giants offensive lineman Jon Runyan said. ""That's just how he is. We're just going to have to keep talking to him. Maybe he'll listen to us one of these days.""",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/umbx9xevfi9rhme9wl3i,N,,2025-12-02 12:05:42.547533

The 23-year-old recorded a career-best 35 receiving yards and scored his second touchdown on Thanksgiving after St. Brown's injury.","The Detroit Lions didn't just lose their Thanksgiving Day game against the Green Bay Packers in 2025. They also lost one of their key offensive players.

Wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown exited the game in the first quarter after suffering an ankle injury when a lineman rolled on his leg from behind while he was engaged in blocking a defender.

St. Brown was able to walk off the field under his own power but quickly headed to the locker room. He was walking with a slight limp and was ruled out for the remainder of the contest after initially being deemed ""questionable"" to return.

The good news for the Lions? St. Brown's injury doesn't appear to be long-term. That said, with the team playing a second consecutive Thursday game, his status entering Week 14 will bear watching as the Lions look to work their way back into the NFC playoff picture.

Here's what to know about St. Brown's injury and when he could return to the field.

Is Amon-Ra St. Brown playing Week 14 vs. Cowboys?

The Lions have not yet announced whether St. Brown will be available for the team's Week 14 game against the Cowboys.

St. Brown didn't practice on Dec. 1, according to the Lions' injury report.

It isn't clear exactly when Detroit will announce a decision on St. Brown's status. That said, ESPN's Adam Schefter said in a Dec. 1 appearance on ""The Pat McAfee Show"" he expects the Lions to wait to make a decision about St. Brown's status until closer to the game.

""I don't think they'll be ready to rule him out quick,"" Schefter said. ""Maybe they will, but I think he's gonna give it a chance to be able to try to be able to play on Thursday. I'm not telling you he will, but this is guy is very, very tough.""

NFL fans will have a better understanding of St. Brown's potential availability based on the Lions' practice reports. Those will be released Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday ahead of the team's ""Thursday Night Football"" game against the Cowboys.

If St. Brown can practice on a full basis early in the week, he may be able to suit up without missing any extra action. If he's limited or a non-participant, it may be difficult for him to suit up for Detroit's second consecutive Thursday game.

Amon-Ra St. Brown injury update

St. Brown was originally classified as ""week-to-week"" after suffering a low ankle sprain in the Lions' Thanksgiving loss to the Green Bay Packers, per NFL Media's Tom Pelissero.

While St. Brown is considered week-to-week because of his ankle injury, Pelissero reports the 26-year-old receiver should avoid being placed on injured reserve. That means the Lions expect St. Brown to return to action without having to miss the minimum four games required by such a stint.

Pelissero also noted the Lions will have a mini-bye after Week 14, which will allow St. Brown some extra rest should Detroit need to hold him out. That could help the fifth-year veteran return to the field quickly, even if he isn't able to suit up against the Cowboys.

Lions WR depth chart

The Lions have six receivers on their 53-man roster, but just two are presently healthy. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

Amon-Ra St. Brown (injured)

Jameson Williams

Kalif Raymond (injured)

Isaac TeSlaa

Tom Kennedy

Dominic Lovett

As long as St. Brown remains out of action, Williams will be Jared Goff's top target. The 2022 first-round pick has generated 706 yards and six touchdowns on 38 receptions this season and will use his blazing speed to get open and make big plays.

TeSlaa, a rookie third-round pick out of Arkansas, could also be more involved in Detroit's offense. The 23-year-old recorded a career-best 35 receiving yards and scored his second touchdown on Thanksgiving after St. Brown's injury. His 6-4, 214-pound frame and elite-level catch radius will make him a legitimate red-zone threat if he sees increased opportunities.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/01/USAT/87553626007-amon-ra-st-brown-lions-120125.jpg?crop=6613,3723,x10,y36&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-02 12:05:50.947462

(AP) — Justin Herbert broke a bone in his non-throwing hand during the Los Angeles Chargers' first offensive series Sunday. After covering it with a hard cast and a white glove, he spent the rest of the afternoon exclusively taking shotgun snaps and handing off to his running backs whenever possible.

By the time Maxx Crosby knocked Herbert to the ground in pure frustration over yet another third-down conversion in the fourth quarter, the quarterback and his Chargers firmly had the upper hand in this long-simmering rivalry.

Herbert threw touchdown passes to Quentin Johnston and Ladd McConkey, and Kimani Vidal made a 59-yard scoring run during a 31-14 victory over the spiraling Las Vegas Raiders.

Vidal rushed for a career-high 126 yards for the Chargers (8-4), who snapped back from an embarrassing loss at Jacksonville and won for their fourth win in five games to keep pressure on the Denver Broncos atop the AFC West. Los Angeles improved to 4-0 in the division.

Herbert will have surgery Monday on the unspecified broken bone on the back of his left hand, but he is optimistic he won't miss any playing time down the stretch.

“I did my best to go out there and take care of business, and I thought we ran the ball really well, so it was really cool to see,” Herbert said. “I'm treating it as if I'm playing (next) Monday.”

Jaret Patterson rushed for his first NFL touchdown since 2021 with 1:55 to play, helping Los Angeles beat its longtime West Coast rivals for the fourth straight time. The Chargers' comfortable victory underlined the current gulf between the Bolts and the Raiders (2-10), who had less support in the SoFi Stadium crowd than in past seasons.

Herbert didn't put up big numbers after he injured his left hand, apparently when he was thrown to the ground by Jeremy Chinn. Johnston fought through contact to score a 10-yard TD one play later, but Herbert went to the locker room and missed part of the next series.

“He's as tough as they come,” Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh said.

Herbert finished 15 of 20 for 151 yards, improving on his career-low 81 yards passing against the Jaguars despite throwing a goal-line interception to Kyu Blu Kelly shortly after his return to the game. He threw only eight passes after halftime, but led a determined offense that converted 12 of its 17 third downs.

Geno Smith passed for 165 yards and threw two touchdown passes to Brock Bowers in the sixth consecutive loss by the Raiders, who have just one victory since Week 1.

At least the Raiders’ long-struggling offense showed mild improvement in its first game under interim offensive coordinator Greg Olson after high-priced Chip Kelly was fired a week ago.

Las Vegas’ 82-yard TD drive in the second quarter was the offense’s longest in four weeks, and the Raiders topped 10 points for the fourth time in eight games when Bowers made a ridiculous one-handed TD grab with 7:49 to play.

“No one knows how hard it is to step into that role when you haven’t been all season,"" Smith said of Olson's first game as play-caller. ""To speak new terminology, to try to get players involved in the game ... but I thought he did a great job, and I’m really appreciative.”

But four-time Pro Bowl selection Crosby exemplified the Raiders' mood when he inexplicably floored Herbert at midfield several seconds after Herbert hit Johnston for a first down with 3:55 to play. The penalty handed 15 yards to the Bolts on a drive that ended in Patterson's TD.

“I was hot about that,” Chargers safety Derwin James said. “I've got a good relationship with Maxx. I know he ain't that type of player. Hopefully he didn't try to do it on purpose.”

Herbert acknowledged he might have been celebrating his completion with a bit more zeal than necessary before he was knocked down by Crosby, who didn't speak to reporters.

“He had been getting after us all day, so I think it was just one of those plays where emotions got the best of him,” Herbert said. “I've got a ton of respect for him as a player.”

Tuli Tuipulotu had two of the Chargers’ five sacks while they limited the Raiders to 156 total yards, including just 31 on the ground.

Raiders coach Pete Carroll was proud of his defense's resilience in the first half, but felt the Bolts took control with Vidal's long TD run 57 seconds after halftime.

“I think we had three guys there that could make the play,"" Carroll said. “It winds up being a (59)-yard touchdown play. That was a backbreaking play in the game. And then we needed to respond, and we didn’t have it to respond, and so they get up by a couple scores, and that plays into their hands.”

The Chargers went up 21-7 on McConkey's 7-yard TD catch late in the third quarter.

Herbert is considered day-to-day, according to the Chargers, who added that his status for their Week 14 home game against the Philadelphia Eagles will be determined later this week.

Herbert was hurt in Sunday's win over the visiting Las Vegas Raiders and said afterward he was preparing like he'd be playing against Philadelphia.

The injury occurred in the first quarter, when Raiders safety Jeremy Chinn hit Herbert on a scramble. Chinn's helmet appeared to connect directly with Herbert's left hand. Herbert stayed in the game, clearly favoring the hand, and threw a touchdown to wide receiver Quentin Johnston on the next play. The signal-caller then went to the locker room with athletic trainers and missed nine plays while a hard cast and glove were applied to his left hand.

Herbert said the most challenging part of continuing to compete was holding on to the football; because of that, the Chargers played the remainder of the game out of the shotgun and pistol formations.

Coach Jim Harbaugh said the Chargers will prepare backup quarterback Trey Lance this week for under-center goal-line scenarios, whenever necessary. Typically, Herbert takes all of the team's first-team reps, but Harbaugh said Lance will get time with the starters in those specific packages.

""That'll be a point of emphasis this week,"" Harbaugh said Monday.

Harbaugh also marveled at Herbert's ability to play through the injury.

""There's never any grimace or flinch,"" Harbaugh said. ""It's pretty amazing.""

Two seasons ago, Herbert fractured the middle finger on his left hand also against the Raiders. The Chargers primarily played out of the shotgun to manage that injury.

""I think in terms of experience, I've gone through similar things, and so I think it'll be helpful,"" he said. ""But at the end of the day, just got to go out there and make sure that everything is good, you're comfortable.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1201%2Fr1583102_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 16:04:39.120823
