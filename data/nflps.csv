Ward was slow to get up following linebacker Foye Oluokun’s tackle that drove him into the ground and ended up getting checked out in the team’s medical tent. But he left there and walked into a nearby tunnel opposite the team’s locker room, presumably to get taken to the onsite X-ray machine at Everbank Stadium.

The team initially said he was questionable to return, but then ruled him out a few minutes later.

Journeyman backup Brandon Allen, a sixth-round draft pick by Jacksonville in 2016, replaced Ward on the next possession. It was the first snaps Ward has missed this season.

Ward, the No. 1 overall pick, has the franchise rookie record with 3,117 yards passing. He needed a season-high 271 yards to move into the top 10 for a single season in team history.

Ward had thrown two touchdown passes in four straight games.

Ward was ruled out with a shoulder injury suffered on a touchdown drive in the first quarter, Tennessee's only score in the first half as the Jaguars lead 31-7 on Jan. 4 at EverBank Field.

Ward had not missed an offensive snap all season before the injury. Brandon Allen made his Titans debut in the first half and has thrown a pick-six to Jaguars safety Antonio Johnson.

The game likely is the last for the majority of the Titans coaching staff and interim coach Mike McCoy.

Cam Little makes 67-yard field goal at halftime buzzer after Titans hand Jags scoring opportunity

The Titans' toothless end-of-half strategy has been a major issue all season, across two head coaches.

It strikes again in Week 18. The Titans, with two timeouts and the ball near midfield, opt to run clock down in between a screen and a checkdown that go nowhere.

Despite having two timeouts, the clock runs down to nine seconds and the Titans go for it on 4th and 8 from their own 49. Brandon Allen's pass is tipped and incomplete.

With three seconds left, it allows Jacksonville to try a field goal with strong-legged Cam Little.

He hits from 67 yards out. The Titans coaching staff again navigates the end of the first half in just about the worst way.

Halftime score: Jaguars 31, Titans 7.

PAT good. Jaguars 21, Titans 7 with 8:07 left.

The Titans offense is in a tough spot today with Ward ruled out and Brandon Allen making his first appearance this year. Add in the season-long changes at playcaller and head coach plus rookie receivers, and this is how it can look. The positive: Tennessee has plenty of time to get back into the game.

The 105th edition of the Battle of Ohio pits two teams not going anywhere but into the offseason. The Browns, though, will do so with many more questions to answer than the Cincinnati Bengals.

Cleveland will have to answer the question of coach Kevin Stefanski's future, as well as that of general manager Andrew Berry. It has a quarterback question it hopes it gets more answers on in Shedeur Sanders' seventh start, and an All-Pro defensive end, Myles Garrett, who would like to end the season the answer to the question ""Who holds the NFL single-season sack record?""

So what happened in Cincinnati? Follow here for updates:

Joe Burrow outruns Myles Garrett for 8-yard gain

Myles Garrett was bearing down on Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow. Garrett, though, wasn't going to be able to get to Burrow, who managed to run for a 8-yard gain.

Andre Szmyt knocks through a 27-yard FG for Browns

The Browns got points on their first drive of the second half when Andre Szmyt kicked a 27-yard field goal with eight minutes left in the third quarter. They nearly had a 37-yard touchdown pass from Shedeur Sanders to Sal Cannella, but Cannella couldn't come down with the ball in the end zone.

Cleveland leads 17-12 over Cincinnati.

Tyson Campbell expected to return

The Browns have announced cornerback Tyson Campbell is expected to return. He was originally questionable with a first-quarter shoulder injury.

Jerry Jeudy picks up 4th down on jet sweep

Wide receiver Jerry Jeudy bobbled the ball, but still managed to hold onto it for a 5-yard gain on a jet sweep to convert a fourth-and-1 from the Browns 44.

Denzel Ward ruled out for rest of game

The Browns have ruled out cornerback Denzel Ward for the remainder of the game. He left the game in the first quarter with a neck injury.

Halftime: Cleveland Browns 14, Cincinnati Bengals 12

Despite being outgained 231-40 in the first half, the Browns have the lead at halftime. They also will get the kick to open the second half.

Joe Burrow to Tee Higgins for Bengals TD

Joe Burrow threw a perfect fade route to Tee Higgins for a 13-yard touchdowh with 29 seconds remaining in the half. Evan McPherson, however, missed his second PAT of the game to keep the Browns' lead at 14-12.

Joe Flacco put in game to QB sneak for 1st down

The Bengals put backup quarterback Joe Flacco in out of the two-minute warning to pick up two yards on a third-and-1 quarterback sneak from the Cleveland 30. Joe Burrow came back in on the next play.

Flacco, in case you somehow forgot, was the Browns' starting quarterback for the first four games. He was traded to the Bengals Oct. 7.

Shedeur Sanders with big losses on back-to-back plays

Shedeur Sanders had back to back double-digit losses on sacks that pushed the Browns into a third-and-31 situation from their own 13. Sanders lost 11 yards on one play, and then lost 10 on the next.

The Browns ultimately had to punt with 7:13 remaining in the first half.

Another defensive score for Cleveland Browns

The Browns have two touchdowns, and neither of them were scored by their offense. This time, cornerback Sam Webb picked up a Noah Fant fumble caused by linebacker Jerome Baker and returned it 47 yards for a touchdown.

Another unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, this one on Webb, led to another 48-yard Andre Szmyt PAT kick. Szmyt made it, pushing the Browns lead to 14-6 with 14:06 remaining in the second quarter.

Tyson Campbell's shoulder, Denzel Ward's neck have both questionable

The Browns announced both cornerbacks Denzel Ward and Tyson Campbell were questionable to return with injuries. Campbell has a shoulder injury, and Ward has a neck injury.

End 1st quarter: Cleveland Browns 7, Cincinnati Bengals 6

The Bengals have a third-and-2 from their own 38 coming out of the quarter break.

Tyson Campbell to the locker room with injury

Tyson Campbell went to the Browns locker room accompanied by medical staff after spending time in the medical tent. Still no official word on the injury.

Devin Bush turns Shelby Harris' tipped pass into pick 6 for Browns

The Browns have turned a Joe Burrow turnover into a touchdown. Linebacker Devin Bush intercepted a Burrow pass that was tipped by defensive tackle Shelby Harris and returned it 97 yard for a Browns touchdown.

Bush was called for unsportsmanlike conduct after the score, forcing Andre Szmyt to kick a 48-yard PAT. Szmyt's kick was good to give the Browns the 7-6 lead with 56 seconds left in the first quarter.

Tyson Campbell shaken up, and Denzel Ward not on field

The Browns appear to be down both starting cornerbacks after Tyson Campbell appeared to suffer a shoulder injury while in on a play against Ke'Shawn Williams with 2:08 remaining in the first quarter. He went to the medical tent for further evaluation.

Denzel Ward, meanwhile, hasn't been on the field for a large percentage of the possession. There's been no word on why.

Bengals turn Shedeur Sanders fumble into Joe Burrow TD pass

The Bengals took a 6-0 lead with 7:59 remaining in the first quarter when Cincinnati's Joe Burrow hit running back Chase Brown coming out of the backfield for a 4-yard touchdown. Alex Wright got a finger on Evan McPherson's PAT kick, which forced it to go wide right.

Shedeur Sanders strip sacked by Cincinnati Bengals

Quarterback Shedeur Sanders gave up the ball on the Browns' first drive. Cam Sample got in and stripped Sanders from behind, and Howard Cross III fell on it for the Bengals at the Cleveland 29 with 10:22 remaining in the first quarter.

JACKSONVILLE ―Tennessee Titans quarterback Cam Ward went into the sideline injury tent and later the locker room to be examined by the athletic training staff after a rushing touchdown on the Titans' opening drive against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Per an announcement in the press box, Ward has a shoulder injury and his return to the game is questionable. The injury in question is to Ward's right throwing shoulder.

Ward was favoring his shoulder coming off the field. He initially sat on the bench for a few seconds before the tent was raised and he went in for further examination. After a minute or two in the tent, Ward walked into the locker room under his own strength.

Ward has played every snap for the Titans on offense throughout his rookie season. The only other quarterback the Titans have on the active roster is Brandon Allen.

Cam Ward injury

Ward had to leave the game after lunging to score on a designed run play from inside the red zone. Ward rushed to the offense's right, following blockers toward the pylon and dove toward the end zone. He landed awkwardly on the ball and a Jaguars defender, bouncing into the end zone for the score.

He remained on the ground for a moment after the play but was able to get up under his own strength and walk toward the sideline. Ward hasn't dealt with any injury concerns across his rookie season, and with his start on Sunday became the first Titans quarterback since Ryan Tannehill in 2021 to start every game in a season.

NFL Week 18 Predictions & Cheat Sheet for PrizePicks, NFL DFS

Find the top Week 18 predictions, picks, matchups to target, and players to target in Sunday's games below in the PrizePicks Cheat Sheet, including analysis on QBs, RBs, WR vs. CB matchups, and OL vs. DL mismatches.

Best QB Predictions for NFL Week 18

Here are two of the top QB vs. defense matchups for fantasy football and PrizePicks NFL this week to help you make your NFL Week 18 predictions.

Browns QB Shedeur Sanders vs. Bengals Defense

Shedeur Sanders gets a nice opportunity here against a Cincinnati secondary that has been one of the league’s weakest units for most of the season. The Bengals rank dead last in the NFL in passing TDs allowed (26) and sit 18th in passing yards afforded overall.

While the Bengals have shown marginal improvement since Week 12, they still 29th in EPA per dropback, per SumerSports. Cleveland has clearly given Sanders the green light, allowing him to operate aggressively from under center. In his limited starts this season, he’s averaging 29 pass attempts.

Against a defense that continues to struggle containing QBs, Sanders may be set up to make another statement before his rookie season closes.

Texans QB C.J. Stroud vs. Colts Defense

Indianapolis enters this matchup severely shorthanded on defense, with CB Sauce Gardner ruled out and DT DeForest Buckner placed on injured reserve. Since Week 12, the Colts rank 31st in passing yards and 30th in completions allowed, showing a clear inability to stop anything through the air.

That sets the stage for C.J. Stroud, who has led Houston’s surge. Despite missing time due to injury, he still ranks top 20 in passing yards (2,087), top 25 in passing TDs (18), and top 20 in average depth of target (8.6). He’s now just two TDs away from matching his 2024 total, and against a depleted Colts secondary, this may be an ideal spot to close that gap quickly.

Week 18 Prediction for PrizePicks: CJ Stroud – 211.5 Passing Yards

Best RB Predictions for NFL Week 18

Here are two of the top RB vs. defense matchups to target for fantasy football and PrizePicks NFL this week to help you make your NFL Week 18 predictions.

Bears RB D’Andre Swift vs. Lions Defense

Since Week 13, the Detroit Lions have been one of the weakest run defenses in the league, allowing 5.3 yards per carry (second-worst) and 152.6 rushing yards per game (fifth-most). That inefficiency has also shown up in the red zone, where Detroit has surrendered eight rushing TDs over that span, the third-most in the NFL.

Can D'Andre Swift exploit this matchup? In head coach Ben Johnson’s first season, the RB ranks top 15 in rushing yards (1,047), top 10 in rushing TDs (9), and is averaging an impressive 4.9 yards per carry. Against a front that has been consistently gashed on the ground, Swift may offer both a high floor and a high ceiling.

Rams RB Kyren Williams vs. Cardinals Defense

While much of the attention in Los Angeles has gone to QB Matthew Stafford and WRs Davante Adams and Puka Nacua, Kyren Williams continues to quietly deliver an elite rushing season. He ranks top 10 in rushing yards (1,192), top 10 in rushing TDs (10), and averages 4.8 yards per carry.

Since Week 13, the Arizona Cardinals have struggled badly against the run, allowing 4.52 yards per carry, 151.8 rushing yards per game (sixth-worst in the NFL), and eight rushing TDs (tied for third-most over that stretch). Williams could be set up for another strong workload and efficient outing.

{{nfl_offer_banner=""/style-system/ui-components-playbook""}}

Best WR vs. CB Matchups to Target: Week 18

Here are two of the top WR vs. CB matchups to target for fantasy football and PrizePicks NFL this week to help you make your NFL Week 18 predictions.

Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb vs. Saints CB Paulson Adebo

The New York Giants play man coverage at one of the highest rates in the NFL (29.9%, per Sharp Football Analysis), and CeeDee Lamb has consistently shredded man defenses. He ranks fourth in the NFL in receiving yards and ninth in receptions vs. man.

This matchup could favor Lamb, who thrives on separation and route nuance against this style of defense. He is expected to see plenty of snaps against CB Paulson Adebo, who ranks 85th out of 112 corners in coverage (via Pro Football Focus) and is allowing nearly a 100 passer rating and 11.1 yards per reception.

This is a potential leverage spot for Dallas’ top weapon.

Jaguars WR Jakobi Meyers vs. Titans CB Darrell Baker Jr.

The Tennessee Titans' secondary remains a liability, and CB Darrell Baker Jr. has been one of the worst coverage defenders in the league. Baker yields a 135.2 passer rating with 14.8 yards per reception.

That sets up well for Jakobi Meyers, who has been a seamless addition to the Jacksonville Jaguars' offense. Meyers ranks top 25 in receptions, targets, and receiving yards. He averages 11.3 yards per reception and is coming off a 6-catch performance in Week 17.

Against a corner who struggles to limit separation and yardage, Meyers profiles as a possible volume and efficiency play.

Week 18 Prediction for PrizePicks: Jakobi Meyers – 3.5 Receptions

Best OL vs. DL Matchups to Target for NFL Week 18

Here are two of the top OL vs. DL matchups to target for fantasy football and PrizePicks NFL this week to help you make your NFL Week 18 predictions.

Eagles DL vs. Commanders OL

The Philadelphia Eagles' defensive line remains one of the most dominant units in the league. DT Jalen Carter has missed time with injury but still owns 41 total pressures, ranking 16th. EDGE Nolan Smith has also battled injuries, yet in limited action has generated 31 pressures and 2 sacks.

The midseason acquisition of pass rusher Jaelan Phillips has only strengthened the group. He’s produced over 70 pressures on the season with 5 sacks, giving Philadelphia relentless havoc from multiple alignments. That sets up poorly for the Washington Commanders' offensive line, which has been one of the weakest in the NFL.

Starting LT Laremy Tunsil is listed as out, as is G Sam Cosmi. Filling in at RG is Andrew Wylie, who ranks 74th out of 80 guards via PFF. First-round pick Josh Conerly Jr. has struggled mightily, surrendering 43 pressures and 8 sacks with 13 penalties, while LG Chris Paul and C Nick Allegretti have also allowed consistent interior pressure.

This is a severe mismatch for Philadelphia’s front to pounce on.

Browns DL vs. Bengals OL

The Cleveland Browns' defensive line is led by a historically dominant season from DE Myles Garrett, who ranks sixth with 75 pressures and first in sacks with 22. Opposite Garrett, Alex Wright has emerged as a reliable complement, tallying 21 pressures and 7 sacks. Inside, rookie DT Mason Graham has impressed, producing 34 pressures.

That firepower goes head-to-head with a shaky Bengals offensive line tasked with protecting QB Joe Burrow. LT Orlando Brown Jr. has endured a rough season, allowing 41 pressures and 8 sacks. On the right side, Amarius Mims has given up 34 pressures and C Ted Karras has surrendered 19 pressures.

With Cleveland’s pass rush working in near-perfect harmony, this matchup appears to clearly favor the Browns’ front.

Week 18 Prediction for PrizePicks: Joe Burrow – 243.5 Passing Yards

Biggest NFL Week 18 Injuries:

Cam Ward Injury Update

Titans QB Cam Ward exited in the first quarter on Sunday after suffering an injury to his throwing shoulder.

The 2025 first-overall draft pick had played 100% of the Titans offensive snaps coming into today.

Veteran backup Brandon Allen replaced Ward under center.

Brock Purdy Injury Update

49ers QB Brock Purdy took a hard hit on the final play of their loss to the Seahawks on Saturday night.

He stayed down on the ground for a while before heading to the medical tent.

After the game, coach Kyle Shanahan said the quarterback suffered a stinger and could have continued playing if the 49ers got the ball back.

Purdy also suffered a thumb injury during the game.

Those issues mean he could have his practice reps managed in the lead up to the Wild Card Round, but he should be ready to go for the playoff opener.

Dolphins vs. Patriots Dolphins inactives: TBA Patriots inactives: TBA Key absence: De'Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins At 7-9, the Miami Dolphins have nothing to play for in Week 18.
Despite being listed as questionable for Week 18, Adams is not expected to play.","Week 18 in the NFL can mean everything — and nothing — to a team. For some franchises — like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or New York Giants — there's actually a lot on the line during the final week of the regular season. For others — like the Miami Dolphins and Houston Texans — there's not a ton at stake that is going to drastically change the team's plans moving forward.

Because of that, teams treat the final week of the regular season much differently than every other week. A team that has already secured a postseason spot might opt to rest players, even if they can still move up or down in the seeding. A team that has no shot at the playoffs might opt to rest players too, not risking a catastrophic injury to a key star in a meaningless game.

Now that the final week of the regular season has arrived, here is a full list of inactives for Week 18, including key players like Nico Collins and Justin Herbert, who are reportedly sitting out:

Saints vs. Falcons

Saints inactives: S Ugo Amadi, QB Spencer Rattler, WR Chris Olave, RB Alvin Kamara, OL Xavier Truss, DT Bryan Bresee, DT Nathan Shepherd

Falcons inactives: P Trenton Gill, ILB Ronnie Harrison, DL Brandon Dorlus, OL Michael Jerrell, WR Casey Washington, WR Malik Heath

Browns vs. Bengals

Browns inactives: TE Harold Fannin Jr., T Jeremiah Byers, C Kingsley Eguakun, WR Jamari Thrash, TE David Njoku, DT Sam Kamara

Bengals inactives: QB Jake Browning (Emergency 3rd QB), WR Charlie Jones, CB Josh Newton, S Daijahn Anthony, DE Joseph Ossai, TE Cam Grandy, DT Jordan Jefferson

Colts vs. Texans

Colts inactives: CB Sauce Gardner, DT Eric Johnson II, S Reuben Lowery III, TE Will Mallory, S George Odum, QB Philip Rivers

Texans inactives: CB Kamari Lassiter, WR Nico Collins, WR Braxton Berrios, QB Graham Mertz, RB Nick Chubb, LB Jamal Hill, OT Trent Brown

Key absence: Nico Collins, WR, Houston Texans

The Houston Texans are safely in the playoffs, though the team could see its seeding move quite a bit depending on what happens in Week 18. The Texans enter the week as the No. 5 seed in the AFC, though the team could move as high as No. 3 and as low as No. 7 based on what happens during the final week of the regular season.

Despite that, star wideout Nico Collins is not expected to play when the Texans take on the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday. Collins is not injured, and is considered a healthy scratch for the contest.

The 26-year-old is coming off yet another strong season, in which he hauled in 71 catches for 1,117 yards and six touchdowns. That performance earned Collins his second straight Pro Bowl nod.

Instead of pushing Collins for another week, the Texans will give the star some rest before the playoffs begin. After missing some time last season, Collins has stayed relatively healthy in 2025, missing just one game this season. Still, the Texans don't want to take any chances with their star ahead of the postseason.

Betting impact: Despite Collins' absence, there was minimal line movement, with the Texans going from -10 to -10.5.

Titans vs. Jaguars

Titans inactives: S Amani Hooker, OLB Arden Key, OG Drew Moss, OG Garrett Dellinger, OT Brandon Crenshaw-Dickson, TE Gunnar Helm

Jaguars inactives: CB Keith Taylor, OL PAtrick Mekari, TE Hunter Long, TE Patrick Herbert, DL Emmanuel Ogbah, DT Maason Smith

Packers vs. Vikings

Packers inactives: QB Malik Willis, LB Quay Walker, RB Josh Jacobs, WR Dontayvion Wicks, S Xavier McKinney, OT Zach Tom, LB Edgerrin Cooper

Vikings inactives: WR Myles Price, QB John Wolford (Emergency 3rd QB), QB Brett Rypien, RB Aaron Jones Sr., OT Walter Routes, TE T.J. Hockenson

Key absence: Jordan Love, QB, Green Bay Packers

The Green Bay Packers are the No. 7 seed in the NFC. The team can't move out of that spot. Because of that, Jordan Love, despite being cleared from a concussion, isn't expected to play in Week 18.

And with backup Malik Willis also dealing with injuries, the Packers announced earlier in the week Clayton Tune will get the start against the Minnesota Vikings. Willis will be inactive for the contest, and Love will serve as Tune's backup.

Since the news was announced previously, Love's absence shouldn't come as a surprise. Running back Josh Jacobs is also out.

Betting impact: Once it became clear the Packers were resting starters, the Vikings' line jumped from -6.5 to -12.5.

Cowboys vs. Giants

Cowboys inactives: LB DeMarvion Overshown, CB Shavon REvel, S Alijah Clark, DT Jay Toia, DT Perrion Winfrey

Giants inactives: S Jevón Holland, WR Ryan Miller, WR Jalin Hyatt, RB Dante Miller, OLB Caleb Murphy, TE Theo Johnson, QB Russell Wilson (Emergency 3rd QB)

NFL players expected to sit out in Week 18

The following players don't play in the early slate in Week 18, but are expected to sit Sunday:

Chargers vs. Broncos

Chargers inactives: TBA

Giants inactives: TBA

Key absence: Justin Herbert, QB, Los Angeles Chargers

The Los Angeles Chargers have little to play for in Week 18. The team can move around in the AFC playoff seeding, but would still go on the road for every one of its first-round matchups.

Because of that, quarterback Justin Herbert is expected to sit, along with running back Omarion Hampton, pass rusher Khalil Mack and safety Derwin James. Herbert, Mack and James aren't battling injuries and are expected to miss the game against the Denver Broncos due to rest.

Advertisement

Herbert turned in another solid season with the Chargers. The 27-year-old finished the year with 3,727 yards and 26 touchdowns.

Key absence: Omarion Hampton, RB, Los Angeles Chargers

Rookie running back Omarion Hampton is also expected to sit for the Chargers in Week 18. Hampton missed a significant amount of time as a rookie thanks to an ankle injury. He played in just nine games, rushing for 545 yards and four touchdowns.

Hampton will miss Week 18 due to an ankle injury as well. He did not practice all week, and was ruled out for the game after the Friday practice report. His absence — unlike Herbert's or Mack's shouldn't come as a major surprise.

Advertisement

Hampton is hoping to play in the team's first playoff game, so the injury isn't expected to be serious.

Betting impact: Once it became clear the Chargers would treat Week 18 as a rest week, the line moved from Broncos -7.5 to Broncos -14, a significant jump.

Dolphins vs. Patriots

Dolphins inactives: TBA

Patriots inactives: TBA

Key absence: De'Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins

At 7-9, the Miami Dolphins have nothing to play for in Week 18. With the season essentially over, star running back De'Von Achane will reportedly sit out the final game of the regular season. He won't be the only key player on the team to miss the contest against the New England Patriots, as wideout Jaylen Waddle is also expected to sit.

Advertisement

It turned out to be an exceptional third season for Achane, who rushed for a career-high 1,350 yards and scored eight rushing touchdowns. He led the league in yards per attempt at 5.7.

Achane was also a threat as a receiver, gaining 488 yards through the air and scoring four receiving touchdowns. That performance earned him his first-ever trip to the Pro Bowl.

Given that there's little on the line for the Dolphins in Week 18, the move was likely made to ensure Achane stays healthy heading into the offseason. The Dolphins are a team that could experience major change after Week 18, as head coach Mike McDaniel could be fired and former starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa could also be on his way out. That could make Achane the most important player on the team's offense next season, which is a good reason to not risk a major injury in Week 18.

Key absence: Jaylen Waddle, WR, Miami Dolphins

Much like Achane, the Dolphins likely feel there's no reason to risk one of their top offensive players in a meaningless game. Also like Achane, Waddle could be one of the most impactful offensive players on the team next season, especially if the Dolphins also move on from Tyreek Hill.

Advertisement

Waddle finished his fifth NFL season with 910 receiving yards and six touchdowns. He hasn't hit the highs he showed early in his career, but remains a strong player who could take a step forward if Hill is shipped out in the offseason.

Betting impact: With both Achane and Waddle expected to sit vs. the Patriots, the Dolphins' line moved from +11.5 to +13.

Cardinals vs. Rams

Cardinals inactives: TBA

Rams inactives: TBA

Key absence: Davante Adams, WR, Los Angeles Rams

Los Angeles Rams wideout Davante Adams was able to return to practice in limited fashion during the week, but will receive another week of rest for his hamstring. Despite being listed as questionable for Week 18, Adams is not expected to play. He reportedly wanted to get out there, but head coach Sean McVay told him to rest up for the playoffs.

Adams is coming off an excellent season, in which he hauled in an NFL-leading 14 touchdowns in his first year with the Rams.

Ole Miss (13-1) will meet Miami (12-2) in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal on Thursday.
Coming into the 2025 season, Simmons was viewed as the clear successor to former Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart, who was a first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.
Simmons, a former four-star recruit, signed with Ole Miss in the Class of 2023 after reclassifying up by two years.
This season, Simmons started the first two games of the season and appeared in eight total, completing 45 of 75 passes for 744 yards, four touchdowns and five interceptions.","Ole Miss quarterback Austin Simmons plans to enter the transfer portal, his father, David Simmons, confirmed.

The redshirt sophomore quarterback began the season as the Rebels’ starter but gave way to transfer Trinidad Chambliss after suffering an ankle injury in September. Chambliss hung on to the starting job after starting in Simmons’ place, and Simmons has served as the Rebels’ backup during their run to the College Football Playoff semifinals.

ESPN and On3 first reported Simmons’ intention to transfer. Simmons intends to stay with the Rebels through the remainder of their Playoff run, according to On3. Ole Miss (13-1) will meet Miami (12-2) in the Fiesta Bowl semifinal on Thursday.

Coming into the 2025 season, Simmons was viewed as the clear successor to former Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart, who was a first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. Simmons, a former four-star recruit, signed with Ole Miss in the Class of 2023 after reclassifying up by two years. He served as Dart’s backup in 2024 and earned his college degree by the time he was 19.

This season, Simmons started the first two games of the season and appeared in eight total, completing 45 of 75 passes for 744 yards, four touchdowns and five interceptions. He also ran for a touchdown.

Simmons will enter the portal as a graduate transfer and will have two years of eligibility left.

What will the market look like for Simmons?

Despite Simmons’ lack of extensive college playing time — he has 262 career snaps in three years — he’ll be a coveted transfer because of his talent level. The lefty has a terrific arm, is a versatile athlete and would easily be one of the 10 best transfer quarterbacks available in this portal cycle.

In recent months, as Chambliss became a Heisman Trophy candidate, the Rebels barreled toward the Playoff and Lane Kiffin prepared his eventual exit for LSU, Simmons was rumored to be a potential target for multiple teams that would be seeking a transfer quarterback for 2026, including LSU and Miami. Kiffin’s move to LSU only fueled further speculation on that Simmons might head to Baton Rouge, but early reports indicate that Missouri is the team to watch in the race for Simmons.

Mizzou coach Eli Drinkwitz and his staff are on the hunt for a transfer after the Tigers’ 2025 starter, Beau Pribula, declared his intentions to transfer in December and officially entered the portal on Friday.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/02171803/GettyImages-2245294117-scaled-e1767392314596.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-04 15:00:07.593012

If he clears waivers, Pharms could return to the practice squad where his roster elevations will reset for the postseason, giving the Patriots flexibility.
The Patriots also elevated OL Brenden Jaimes and DL Leonard Taylor III from the practice squad.
Starting with Williams, the standout defensive tackle hasn't played in a game since suffering a high-ankle sprain in the Patriots Week 11 victory over the Jets.
As for the Patriots practice squad elevations, Jaimes and Taylor have been elevated for the third time each.","Reinforcements have arrived for Sunday's regular-season finale vs. the Dolphins, with the Patriots activating LT Will Campbell (knee) and DT Milton Williams (ankle) off injured reserve on Saturday.

New England had one open spot on the 53-man roster but needed to make space to activate the two standout linemen for Week 18. The Patriots corresponding move was to waive DT Jeremiah Pharms Jr., who signed to the 53-man roster last week after spending most of the season on the practice squad. If he clears waivers, Pharms could return to the practice squad where his roster elevations will reset for the postseason, giving the Patriots flexibility. The Patriots also elevated OL Brenden Jaimes and DL Leonard Taylor III from the practice squad.

Obviously, it's good news that Campbell and Williams are returning to the lineup for Sunday's regular-season finale at Gillette Stadium, but it's great news that they'll be available for the Patriots upcoming playoff run. Starting with Williams, the standout defensive tackle hasn't played in a game since suffering a high-ankle sprain in the Patriots Week 11 victory over the Jets. Williams was injured just eight plays into that Thursday nighter, exiting the game in the first half and eventually landing on injured reserve. The veteran opened his 21-day practice window last week, but the Patriots held him out against the Jets to let him ramp up to his return.

Before suffering his ankle injury, Williams was one of the Patriots best defenders and one of the NFL's top defensive tackles. Williams ranks fifth among defensive tackles in pressure rate (12.7%) with 17 total pressures, while helping anchor New England's run defense with nine run stops in 11 games. With their standout defensive tackle available, the Patriots run defense was fourth in rush EPA in their first 10 games compared to 30th in their last five games.

Williams, who can shed blocks with the best of them, makes individual plays while also having a trickle-down effect on the Patriots defensive line. Besides fans and Williams himself, star DT Christian Barmore might be the happiest Patriot about Williams' return, as Barmore has been seeing an uptick in double teams without his partner on the inside. Barmore has seen a double-team block on 28 of his 65 pass-rush snaps, or 43.1%, while also getting extra attention against the run. Williams returning should free-up Barmore, and vice versa, with opposing offensive lines having two decide who to double team on each play.

As for Campbell, the standout rookie left tackle returns to the lineup after injuring his knee in a collision in a Week 12 win over the Bengals. The No. 4 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft ranks second among rookie tackles in pressure rate allowed (5.4%) and looked the part of a franchise left tackle before his injury. During the practice week, Campbell was a full participant in all three sessions, signaling that he'll be a full-go this week and into the Patriots postseason run.

Although their rookie left tackle is expected to return, the Patriots will still be down third-rounder Jared Wilson, as the left guard remains in concussion protocol. With some moving parts on the left side of the offensive line, New England's expected starting five is LT Will Campbell, LG Ben Brown, C Garrett Bradbury, RG Mike Onwenu, and RT Morgan Moses. Sunday's game will be the first time Brown and Campbell have started next to each other since Week 4.

As for the Patriots practice squad elevations, Jaimes and Taylor have been elevated for the third time each. Jaimes has played a special teams role on the field goal protection unit, while Taylor logged a run stuff in 22 snaps in last week's win over the Jets. As with Pharms, Jaimes and Taylor's standard elevations will reset in the postseason, giving New England the option to add the two linemen to the game-day roster in the playoffs if needed.

Lastly, Miami elevated RB Jeff Wilson Jr. and LB Derrick McLendon from the practice squad. Wilson Jr. being elevated signals that star RB De'Von Achane, who is listed as doubtful due to a shoulder injury, won't play on Sunday. Achane leads the NFL in yards per carry (5.7) and explosive runs (40), so that's a significant loss for the Dolphins offense. Miami will lean on running backs Ollie Gordon II, Jaylen Wright, and Wilson instead.

On Sunday, the Patriots will be playing for seeding in the AFC playoffs, with a chance at the No. 1 overall seed in the conference. If the Patriots win, they secure a top-two seed in the AFC and could climb to the No. 1 seed with a Broncos loss. If they lose to Miami, they could fall to the No. 3 seed with a Jaguars win. In all, there are five different scenarios for New England: first-round bye, vs. Chargers (most likely), vs. Bills, vs. Jaguars, or vs. Texans in the Wild Card round.

Despite defeat, Chicago was given its credit for going toe to toe in a big primetime road game against the 49ers last week.","Here are my NFL Week 18 best bets:

Detroit +3 at Chicago

One of the bigger stories of the 2025 NFL season has been the fall of the Detroit Lions. Many believed this would be their year to come out of the NFC after going 15-2 last season. One of my best bets in the VSiN Pro Football Betting Guide was the Lions Under 11.5 season wins because losing both coordinators seemed like too much for this team to overcome, and that proved to be the case, especially on offense, where Ben Johnson has the Chicago Bears as the NFC North Champions in his first season as head coach.

Detroit’s playoff hopes ended on Christmas in Minnesota with a 23-10 defeat despite holding Max Brosmer and the Vikings to three net passing yards. Yes, three net passing yards.

Chicago’s hopes of staying in the race for the NFC No. 1 seed fell by the wayside last week as the Bears still had a chance on the game’s final play but fell short in San Francisco. The Bears can still get the 2 seed and another matchup with Green Bay, with a victory over Detroit, but a loss would only drop them to No. 3, where a rematch with the 49ers or a battle with the Rams awaits.

Detroit is playing for pride and a winning season as it currently sits 8-8. So, there is a good reason to expect the Lions not to phone it in here. Meanwhile, the Bears would certainly like some payback for the 52-21 beatdown they suffered in Detroit all the way back in Week 2.

Jared Goff and head coach Dan Campbell are 23-13 ATS together as underdogs in Detroit.

The Bears have lived off turnovers defensively this season, and they are +22 in turnover margin, which is eight better than the next team (Houston +14). They have needed to do so considering Chicago’s rankings of No. 27 in yards allowed (357.3), No. 28 in rushing yards allowed (136), and 22nd in points allowed (24.8).

Despite defeat, Chicago was given its credit for going toe to toe in a big primetime road game against the 49ers last week. On the other hand, Detroit’s last impression on bettors was a disastrous performance in Minnesota. This is the buy low with Detroit here. Chicago, with more to play for and in some cold weather (low 20s), is only laying 3 here? Hmmmm.

Cincinnati -7.5 vs. Cleveland

At 6-10 and 4-12, neither of these teams has anything substantial to play for except for individual pride and records. Cleveland’s Myles Garrett is one sack away from the all-time single-season NFL record. Cincinnati’s Ja’Marr Chase is currently two receptions behind Arizona’s Trey McBride and the LA Rams’ Puka Nacua for the league lead in receptions. As an aside note, before you bet every Chase prop over, keep in mind that these incentive props are already highly taxed.

Cleveland broke a four-game losing streak last week with a 13-6 win over Pittsburgh and got to leave a positive impression in front of the “Dawg Pound” after two previous close home losses to Tennessee and Buffalo over the past month.

Meanwhile, Cincinnati’s offense has been cooking again with Joe Burrow back under center and the offensive line starting to come together.

However, the defense has been the story as Cincinnati has given up three of its lowest four point totals of the season in the last three weeks. After being near historically bad levels in the meat of the season, first-year defensive coordinator Al Golden has implemented more three down linemen packages, and the team has improved its tackling substantially.

The Browns, 30th in total offense and 31st in scoring defense, are not likely to test the Bengals’ defense all that much here. Cincinnati has a chance to end the season on a three-game winning streak and carry some momentum into 2026 with a healthy Burrow.

Purdy Injured on 49ers’ Final Drive The game was all but over when San Francisco took the field for its final drive.
On that last drive, Purdy cut the thumb on his throwing hand open after striking a player’s helmet on a throw.
“#49ers QB Brock Purdy suffered a stinger on the last play that sent him to the medical tent.","In their biggest game of the year, the San Francisco 49ers may have played their worst game.

The team finished with just 173 yards of total offense and only 9 first downs against the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday. The loss cost the 49ers the NFC West crown and the No. 1 seed in the NFC plus home-field advantage in the playoffs.

Star running back Christian McCaffrey was held to just 23 yards rushing and 34 yards receiving on 6 catches, and more surprisingly, he was kept out of the end zone. But McCaffrey wasn’t the only one who struggled.

Quarterback Brock Purdy completed 19 of 27 passes but threw for just 127 yards and an interception, marking the first time this season he didn’t score at least one touchdown. His 64.9 passer rating was also his second-lowest of the year as well.

And while the game was as ugly as could be, it could’ve ended a whole lot worse than it actually did for San Francisco.

Purdy Injured on 49ers’ Final Drive

The game was all but over when San Francisco took the field for its final drive. Trailing 13-3 with 2:20 left in the fourth quarter, a comeback was highly unlikely.

But with the division and No. 1 seed still somewhat in sight, Purdy trudged out to try and find some late-game magic. He found a bloody finger and the blue medical tent instead.

On that last drive, Purdy cut the thumb on his throwing hand open after striking a player’s helmet on a throw. A few plays later, he was sacked on a fourth-and-6 after throwing an incomplete pass intended for tight end George Kittle.

As the Seahawks took the field to run the clock out, Purdy was seen heading to the medical tent. Head coach Kyle Shanahan gave reporters an update on the QB’s status after the game.

“#49ers QB Brock Purdy suffered a stinger on the last play that sent him to the medical tent. Coach Kyle Shanahan said he was OK and could’ve gone back in,” NFL Network’s Rapoport posted on X.

Replays showed Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall blindsiding Purdy from behind right as he got rid of the ball. He was sandwiched between Hall and another defender and laid on the turf for a few moments before getting up.

Fourth-Quarter Woes Continue

Purdy’s potential injury was the story of the game, but what can’t be overlooked is the team’s continued struggles in the fourth quarter.

The 49ers mustered just 68 yards on 11 plays on their two drives in the quarter, while Seattle controlled time of possession 8:37 to 6:23 and ran up 144 yards of offense.

“Including playoffs since 2017, the 49ers are 1-38 under Kyle Shanahan when trailing by 7+ points entering the 4th quarter,” ESPN Insights wrote on X after the game. “The lone win came over the Packers in the 2023 Divisional Round against the Packers. #NFLonESPNInsights.”

“The 49ers are the only team in the NFL that has not won a game when trailing by 10+ points in the 4th quarter since the start of the 2017 season. They are 0-46 in such games,” ESPN’s Field Yates tweeted before the game.

And other news - Miami Herald,Barry Jackson,,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/miami-dolphins/article314107783.html,"The Dolphins made their final roster moves of the season on Saturday, elevating linebacker Derrick McLendon and running back Jeff Wilson Jr. from the practice squad.
“He’s athletic, he’s got twitch, he’s got speed,” defensive line coach Sean Ryan said of McLendon.
Defensively, the Dolphins will be without safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, who will miss his third game in a row with a calf injury.
Kicker Jason Sanders was not removed from injured reserve on Saturday, meaning Riley Patterson will complete a full season as the Dolphins’ kicker.
The Dolphins entered Week 18 at No.","The Dolphins made their final roster moves of the season on Saturday, elevating linebacker Derrick McLendon and running back Jeff Wilson Jr. from the practice squad.

Wilson’s elevation (his second of the season) is more evidence that De’Von Achane is very unlikely to play because of a shoulder injury. Achane, the NFL’s leader in per carry average (5.7) and the Dolphins’ MVP this season, is listed as doubtful for Sunday’s finale at New England (4:25 p.m., WSVN Fox 7).

If he doesn’t play Sunday, he will end the season with the third-highest rushing total in a season in team history (1350 yards). Achane needs only 23 yards to surpass Ricky Williams’ 2003 rushing total for second on the list. Williams had 1,853 yards rushing in 2002, which is the team record.

McLendon, a training camp standout, was elevated for the second week in a row but is still waiting to make his NFL debut.

He was not active for the Tampa Bay game because Miami needed to keep another offensive linemen active when it was determined last Sunday morning that center Aaron Brewer could not play with a neck injury.

“He’s athletic, he’s got twitch, he’s got speed,” defensive line coach Sean Ryan said of McLendon. “Those are tangible things. Things that stand out to me are his work ethic and his motor. He’s a positive influence on his teammates and coaches. That guy has got a lot of things that really make an intriguing quality prospect.”

Two Dolphins edge rushers are questionable for the game: Chop Robinson (who was in the later stages of concussion protocol on Friday) and Quinton Bell, who is dealing with an illness.

Several other players on offense are questionable for the finale, including receiver Jaylen Waddle (ribs), right tackle Austin Jackson (a new groin injury and a back issue) and center Aaron Brewer (neck). Brewer practiced fully on Friday, but Jackson and Waddle were limited. Waddle said he’s unsure if he will be able to play on Sunday.

Defensively, the Dolphins will be without safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, who will miss his third game in a row with a calf injury.

Linebacker Jordyn Brooks, the NFL’s leading tackle, is questionable with a hamstring injury but will try to play.

Kicker Jason Sanders was not removed from injured reserve on Saturday, meaning Riley Patterson will complete a full season as the Dolphins’ kicker.

This and that

Mike McDaniel’s job security is being portrayed in different ways by different national outlets this weekend. While SI.com’s Albert Breer said his return next season is a “coin toss,” NFL Network said “signs continue to point toward McDaniel returning.”

▪ A reminder heading into the weekend: The Dolphins (7-9), who entered Week 18 standing 11th in draft order, can jump the three 6-10 teams — No. 8 New Orleans, No. 9 Kansas City and No. 10 Cincinnati — if Miami loses at the Patriots and the Saints beat the Falcons, the Chiefs beat the Raiders and the Bengals beat the Browns.

Miami realistically can drop no worse than 13th.

▪ One big concern to emerge this season: Robinson’s regression. He has just 21 tackles and four sacks in 417 defensive snaps, and his 8.8 pass rush win rate is abysmal, 125th among NFL edge players, as Simon Clancy noted.

Pro Football Focus rates him 100 of 113 qualifying edge players. He looks more like a No. 3 outside linebacker than a starter.

▪ After being on the field for every Tampa Bay offensive play last week, Dolphins safety Ashtyn Davis has played 76 percent of Miami’s defensive snaps, putting him in position to earn a $500,000 bonus for playing 60 percent of the team’s snaps. Davis said it speaks very well of the organization that Miami played him instead of sitting him.

Davis’ bonus is contingent on Miami finishing in the top 25 in points allowed, he said. The Dolphins entered Week 18 at No. 21.

Some of Bradley Chubb’s bonuses are tied to Miami finishing in the top 20 in points allowed.

Rashod Bateman, WR, BAL (illness): If the Ravens win, Bateman is likely to be available for the playoffs. However, he'll miss out on Sunday night's must-win season finale. Devontez Walker and Tylan Wallace might be in line for some surprise heroics.

Harold Fannin Jr., TE, CLE (groin): David Njoku (knee) is also going to sit out the finale, leaving the likes of Blake Whiteheart to get some unexpected playing time.

Javonte Williams, RB, DAL (shoulder): Malik Davis (calf) is also out, which means Jaydon Blue is in line for potential super-sleeper Week 18 status.

Omarion Hampton, RB, LAC (ankle): He's getting rested, as is QB Justin Herbert (hand). Trey Lance will start at quarterback.

Geno Smith, QB, LV (ankle): Kenny Pickett? Aidan O'Connell? Both? Is this how the Pete Carroll era ends in Las Vegas? Is anyone shocked?

Aaron Jones Sr., RB, MIN (hip): Jordan Mason (ankle) was not on the team's final injury report and should handle lead-back duties.

T.J. Hockenson, TE, MIN (shoulder): Josh Oliver will start in Week 18. Perhaps we've already seen Hockenson's last game as Viking.

Alvin Kamara, RB, NO (knee): Once again, Audric Estime will be the team's top RB option.

Chris Olave, WR, NO (illness): Additionally, Mason Tipton (groin) was placed on IR, leaving Dante Pettis, Kevin Austin Jr. and Samori Toure to hold down the proverbial fort.

Theo Johnson, TE, NYG (illness): Daniel Bellinger will once again fill in for an under-the-weather Johnson.

Wan'Dale Robinson, WR, NYG (ribs): With the receiver landing on IR, Darius Slayton and Isaiah Hodgins will be the ones in Jaxson Dart's sights.

Breece Hall, RB, NYJ (knee): Isaiah Davis (concussion) is also out of action, leaving Kene Nwangwu and Khalil Herbert to stand behind QB Brady Cook.

Dallas Goedert, TE, PHI (knee): The Eagles were already planning to rest most starters, but Goedert is actually dealing with an injury. Still, he should be back for the playoffs. Welcome the Week 18 combo of QB Tanner McKee and TE Grant Calcaterra.

Gunnar Helm, TE, TEN (toe): Chig Okonkwo will get to showcase his ""headed for free agency"" talents.

Jayden Daniels, QB, WAS (elbow): With Marcus Mariota (hand) also hurting, Josh Johnson takes over the hosting chair in the Commanders' huddle one last time.

Dalton Kincaid, TE, BUF (knee): There's no need for Kincaid to risk it in Week 18 and, besides, Dawson Knox (knee) was removed from the final injury report and will play.

Rome Odunze, WR, CHI (foot): It's probably better for the Bears to make sure Odunze is healthy for the playoffs. Luther Burden III (quad) was not on the final injury report and will play.

Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR, DET (knee): St. Brown is trending toward suiting up on Sunday, but with nothing to play for, it's realistic to think that he might pack it up early.

Isiah Pacheco, RB, KC (risk avoidance): If he sits, as appears to be likely, Kareem Hunt and Brashard Smith would split RB duties.

Xavier Worthy, WR, KC (illness): A late-week downgrade to doubtful in a meaningless game for Kansas City? Look elsewhere for your WR needs.

Kimani Vidal, RB, LAC (neck): Hassan Haskins (concussion) is also questionable for this one. Someone is going to have to be in the huddle, but perhaps it matters not who that ends up being.

Blake Corum, RB, LAR (ankle): Kyren Williams (ankle) practiced more than Corum this week, so he may get more touches. It's also possible the team pivots to Ronnie Rivers and/or Jarquez Hunter to give their top RB duo some rest.

Tyler Higbee, TE, LAR (ankle): Terrance Ferguson (hamstring) is doubtful. Colby Parkinson is in line to start, although Higbee has been activated from IR and could see some Week 18 action.

Davante Adams, WR, LAR (hamstring): Potentially, the Rams could give Adams some playing time to see exactly how close he is to being 100% -- or they could simply choose to save him for the postseason.

Jaylen Waddle, WR, MIA (ribs): It's likely to be a game-time call here, but don't count on Waddle playing. Also, TE Darren Waller (groin) was placed on IR.

ANSWER: As a general rule, the NFL does not comment one way or another about specific calls in a game.
And league ownership has shown little appetite to expand replay for the purpose of adding more penalties to the game.","PAUL COSTANZA FROM NORTH ATTLEBORO, MA: Any idea of what the offensive game plan will be on Sunday vs. the Ravens? Try to establish the run first, or utilize the tight ends more? Against the Browns it looked like our WRs could not create separation.

ANSWER: There are a lot of things that will be different about the Steelers offense this week vs. what we saw in Cleveland. First of all, both G Isaac Seumalo and WR Calvin Austin III are expected to play after missing the Browns game with injuries. And the other significant factor is how Baltimore's defense differs from Cleveland's. The Browns defense ranked No. 2 in the NFL in total yards allowed vs. a No. 25 ranking for the Ravens; the Browns ranked No. 2 in the NFL in passing yards allowed per game vs. No. 29 for the Ravens; and the Browns defense ranked No. 2 in the NFL in sacks per pass attempt vs. No. 31 for the Ravens. Because this is a winner-take-all situation, how it happens is not as relevant as the Steelers simply finding a way to score more points than the Ravens.

LARRY LASH FROM TARENTUM, PA: I heard a professional analyst comment on Mason Rudolph never getting a fair chance to be a starting QB in the NFL. Do you think he did, I mean with the Steelers and Titans? What's your opinion and also do you believe he was ever really considered Ben's heir?

ANSWER: My recollection was that when the Steelers spent a No. 3 (76th overall) pick in the 2018 NFL Draft on Mason Rudolph, their quarterback depth chart contained Ben Roethlisberger, Landry Jones, and Joshua Dobbs. Roethlisberger might have been 36, but he still was playing to the level of a franchise QB, and neither Jones nor Dobbs had shown themselves to be special. I believe the Steelers liked Rudolph after the scouting process, and when it came to their pick in the third round, they decided he was a good value. I don't believe the Steelers were shopping for an ""heir,"" but if Rudolph shows himself to be a better backup than Jones, then it was worth it to select him at that point in the draft. I don't know anything about your ""professional analyst"" source, but what I have learned is that the league decides. Players are able to become unrestricted free agents, which means they are free to move wherever and all 32 teams are able to bid on their services. Rudolph hit unrestricted free agency two different times. The league decided what he is.

STEVE SOKOL FROM BEIT SHEMESH, ISRAEL: DK Metcalf's suspension for two games means that he loses two games' salary. Will that money get added to next year's salary cap?

ANSWER: A player who is suspended by the NFL does not receive his salary during the length of the suspension, and his team does not have that money charged to the salary cap. Teams that have salary cap money left after the season ends and everyone has been paid are able to carry that over to the following league year.

JOHN MARTIN FROM ARENDTSVILLE, PA: In regard to the ""no call"" pass interference on the last play vs the Browns, has any official comment come from the league about whether they feel that was a bad ""no call?"" It seems sometimes they come out and comment but most times they do not. Was Aaron Rodgers ever fined for his comments? Also, I know they experimented with allowing coaches to challenge pass interference in the past, is there any talk of bringing that back?

ANSWER: As a general rule, the NFL does not comment one way or another about specific calls in a game. There could be a pool report, where an on-site media member may be granted a brief audience with the game's referee to ask about some specific things. But there is no ""announcement."" I'm not going to claim there are times when information leaks or is leaked, but you catch my drift.

What Aaron Rodgers said and how he said it after the game about that play did not deserve a fine. And league ownership has shown little appetite to expand replay for the purpose of adding more penalties to the game.

SCOTT RANDALL FROM CONWAY, SC: Regardless of how this season ends, do you think Aaron Rodgers is done? The class of college quarterbacks declaring for the NFL Draft doesn't seem elite. Do you think if Will Howard gets in a full preseason that he will have any shot at a chance to be the starter?

ANSWER: A lot of questions in there, and some of them are liberally sprinkled with qualifiers, but all I am willing to opine at this stage of the process is that I would be surprised if the Steelers went to training camp with a QB depth chart that had Will Howard any higher than No. 2. If that means he will ""have any shot at a chance"" then the answer to your last question is a yes.

RAY ZARATE FROM COMSTOCK PARK, MI: Whatever happened to Will Howard? Nothing is ever said about his progression.

ANSWER: Will Howard is the No. 3 quarterback on the 53-man roster. Players in that role do not have progress reports made and then given to the public.

GRANT SPELLERBERG FROM CUTLER BAY, FL: A few weeks back I sent you a question regarding the trade for DK Metcalf and the trading away of George Pickens. If you compare their stats you can see that Pickens' are way better. You made a point indicating that Pickens' behavior was an issue. As it turns out DK may cost the Steelers a playoff spot because of his behavior. Do you still think it was a wise choice for the Steelers to make those trades?

ANSWER: The way I view this submission is that you believe the Steelers were unwise to make those trades, and you're looking for me to agree with you.

Purdy walked away the 49ers’ 13-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks battered and bruised.

The 49ers quarterback had his thumb bloodied after he was hit in the second half following a pass attempt.

The hits didn’t stop there for Purdy.

On fourth-and-6 with less than two minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, Purdy was sandwiched in the pocket by Seahawks linebacker Derick Hall and defensive lineman Leonard Williams as he threw an incomplete pass. Purdy was on the ground for a moment in visible pain before he walked off the field under his own power.

The Seahawks took over possession of the football and went into victory formation with the game decided.

Was Brock Purdy injured against the Seahawks?

Head coach Kyle Shanahan announced postgame that Purdy suffered a stinger on the desperation play.

“Purdy would’ve went back in,” Shanahan said to reporters. “He checked out all right.”

Purdy was sacked three times and hit three times in the loss. He was pressured on 11 dropbacks, per Pro Football Focus.

San Francisco’s loss prevented them from winning the NFC West and the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs.

Shanahan said Purdy’s stinger won’t prevent him from playing in next week’s wild-card game.

The 49ers have delt with a slew of injuries this season. Linebacker Fred Warner (ankle) and Nick Bosa (knee) suffered season-ending injuries earlier in the season. Standout left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring) and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee and ankle) were both inactive on Saturday due to injuries.

San Francisco does expect Williams, Pearsall and Purdy to be available for next week’s road playoff game.

“It would’ve been nice to have both home games here and get a bye, but it is what it is,” Shanahan said. “This team’s been through a lot this year. Now we got to do it the hard way. We’ll embrace the (expletive) out of doing it the hard way.

Buffalo Bills head coach Sean McDermott is not going to end Allen's consecutive starts streak cold turkey.

Allen injured his right foot against the Cleveland Browns in Week 16 and aggravated it in the loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 17. Buffalo can potentially improve their playoff seed on Sunday.

Allen owns the NFL’s longest active consecutive starts streak by a quarterback at 134 games, including 121 regular-season contests and 13 playoff appearances. The streak is tied for the ninth-longest by a quarterback in league history.

""You've got to know, to get (Allen) off the field, you're going to have to ... I'm going to have to wrestle him,"" McDermott said.

The Bills host the New York Jets at 4:25 p.m. Sunday.

Is Josh Allen playing today?

Allen is expected to extend his consecutive starts streak to 135 games, including playoffs.

""He'll be good to go for the game,"" McDermott said his franchise quarterback.

Allen did not practice Wednesday or Thursday and was a limited participant Friday. He's doesn't have a game designation on the Bills' final injury report.

It's possibly Allen only plays a snap or series to extend his consecutive starts streak then gives way to backup Mitchell Trubisky.

Allen had X-rays on his right foot after the Bills' 13-12 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. The X-rays were negative. It's the second straight week Allen received X-rays postgame.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Allen's foot feels better now that it did before he played against the Eagles.

""Maybe in a slightly better spot than the early part of last week,"" McDermott said. ""We'll just take it one day at a time and see how he does here through the week.""

Josh Allen

Mitchell Trubisky

Allen is second in the league with 39 combined passing and rushing touchdowns. His overall numbers are similar to his NFL MVP-winning season last year. His completion percentage has ticked up to 69.3% from 63.6% but his interceptions (6 to 10) and sacks (14 to 40) have also increased.

Because Allen is an ironman, Trubisky has only appeared in three games this season, completing 3 of 6 passes for 54 yards.

Brock Purdy was under siege all night and had trouble getting up off the turf after being hit by two Seattle defenders on his final pass of the game, a fourth-down incompletion. Coach Kyle Shanahan said postgame that he suffered a “stinger” nerve pinch in his left shoulder and would have returned to play if the game had not ended.

Purdy was 13-of-27 for 127 yards and an interception, which went off the hands of Christian McCaffrey and into those of Seahawks linebacker Drake Thomas to end the 49ers’ hopes of getting back within a single score early in the fourth quarter. He said he felt good postgame after the injury initially kept him down.

McCaffrey, for his part, led the 49ers in rushing, but he did so with just 23 yards on eight carries. Purdy had two carries for 21 yards. Brian Robinson Jr. had two for nine yards.

McCaffrey also led the team with six receptions, but they netted just 34 yards. Jauan Jennings had 35 yards on four catches and George Kittle had 29 on five receptions. Demarcus Robinson had three catches for 24 yards starting in place of Ricky Pearsall.

Kyle Shanahan

On whether the injuries will linger into next week:

Possibly with Tatum (Bethune) and Dee (Winters). I’m not sure — they say Purdy would have gone back in; he checked out all right.

On the Seahawks’ stifling defense:

It was what we expected, just with their defense, and we expected to do better than we did. … We knew it would be a challenge. They got us in a number of moments, had a couple of opportunities, I thought, that we missed. You can’t miss those against a team like that.

On the key plays:

A chance to recover that fumble could be different, a chance to stop them on third-and-17 on that run could be different. The turnover at the end inside the 5. Their third-and-2, our fourth-and-2. A number of plays that could have made it different.

On the execution of the offense:

Having 40 plays. We couldn’t get the run game going — I think we only had 12 runs. I think we converted one third down in the first half. That was the only series that we got to score on. You convert two third downs in the game, they control the clock for 40 minutes.

On the game:

It’s kind of the opposite of what happened last game. I thought we did better on third downs in Week 1. We had the ball for 40 minutes. We averaged about 3 yards a carry in that game, but we stayed on the field so we were able to get 36 runs. Today the run average was similar, but we only had 12 of them. They controlled the ball, kept it from us and when we had to get something going, we didn’t stay on the field on third (down).

On going on the road in the playoffs as a wild card:

We’re ready for it. It would have been nice to have both home games here and get a bye, but it is what it is. I mean, this team has been through a lot this year. Now we got to do it the hard way and we’ll embrace the (expletive) out of doing it the hard way.

On how close Ricky Pearsall and Trent Williams were to playing:

They were pushing it. It would have been too risky to play them, though.

On whether Pearsall and Williams would have had a better chance to play if the game were Sunday:

Much better chance.

On assessing the Seahawks:

A very good defense, a good offense. I mean, they’ve been showing that they’re one of the best teams in the league all year. That didn’t feel much different than the team we played in Week 1.

I thought Brock battled out there. On the one drive, we got something going, where we turned it over there inside the 5. But he made some big plays on that drive. He battled throughout the game. I know he was under duress. We had a feeling that would be the case going into the game. But none of us played good enough to win, but not disappointed at all in Brock.

On the defense:

We need to tackle better. We need to play better than that. I was proud that they kept battling and was able to hold them to 13 points. That’s what gave us a chance there at the end.

Christian McCaffrey

On the loss:

Obviously we wanted that one. But onward, man. We’re in the playoffs and we don’t have time to sulk over it.

On the interception that went off his hands:

It’s a play that I have to make, absolutely have to make. I expect nothing less, and it’s completely on me.

On the defense’s play and his drop:

The defense did an unbelievable job the whole game. They held them to 13 and that’s huge. It’s on us. Again, I go back to that play that could have put us in the game.

On whether this team can make a run on the road in the playoffs:

This whole season’s been difficult for us and we continue to beat the odds, continue to show people that we’re a real football team. We didn’t show it today. We know that but I love the guys in the locker room and how we’ve responded all year.

Brock Purdy

On the Seattle defense:

Obviously they’re a good defense, good front. They did a good job with making us go through reads and checking the ball down. For me, I just wish I could have been a little bit more efficient. They’re going to make you work for the yards and make you have to convert on third down.

On missing out on the No. 1 seed:

That was our goal, but we can’t dwell on it. We have a pretty quick turnaround here and we got to go win next week. But our team has been through so much adversity, guys going down, next man up. People have counted us out and that’s fine.

On the stinger:

I feel good. Just got hit and the left shoulder sort of lit up. So I feel good right now. We’ll see how I feel tomorrow.

On the offense, which had been rolling, struggling so mightily:

We always feel like there’s plays left out there that we could have converted, we had an opportunity and we just didn’t do the X, Y and Z. … They played good defense. We didn’t execute and when all these other games where we’ve pulled away and had good points and stats and all that stuff, it’s because we execute on the gritty third downs. We stay on the field and then we go score touchdowns after that.

On missing an open Kittle:

It was one of those things where I felt pressure, but at the end of the dya, I need to find a way to set my feet and get it to him and take a hit if I need to. I was concerned with just having my feet set and then I saw george and from where I was at, I didn’t really have a clear picture to be honest, but when we got back to the sideline, it was like ‘Dang, he was there.’

On McCaffrey’s bobbled interception:

That’s a tough play. Ball got tipped at the line, so it came out weird and he’s trying to adjust. He beat his guy, and then all of a sudden, the ball is just coming in weird and it just didn’t go our way and the other guy was right there to catch it right in his lap. … Christian’s a baller, dude. He’s going to live to play the next play and he’s a Hall of Fame running back, so he should walk out with his head up.

George Kittle

On the game:

In the NFL, you have a bad game, any game. Unfortunately, we decided to have a bad game today. Not efficient. What were we, 2-of-9 on third down? Didn’t really get our run game going.

On the loss and the playoffs looming:

We lost at home to a division rival for the division and the 1 seed and that sucks. That just is what it is. Yes, I’m disappointed about it. It’s horrible. Good news is I get to play football next week, whether it’s Saturday, Sunday, Monday, whenever it is. I get to play football again on the road in a hostile environment.

Would I much rather be on a bye and get to play at Levi’s Stadium? Yeah, but that’s just not our reality. So I fully expect our team to come in, and attack it. We have a whole new season ahead of us.

On rooting for the Cardinals against the Rams tomorrow:

I’m not a betting man, but I’m just rooting for Budda Baker to have three pick-sixes tomorrow, that’s it, and Trey McBride have 200 yards, three touchdowns, that’d be awesome.

On the Seattle defense:

They pressured randomly, they brought a lot of pressures, which is what they do. They drop really deep, they force you to check the ball down and they routed the ball really well.

On the frustration of not having an answer to the Seahawks’ defense:

I feel like we kind of did have an answer there at the end. And then you have a tipped ball, it’s weird, and then another tip for an interception at the 2-yard line. We score a touchdown there and it’s 10-13, who knows? It’s a completely different game.

On leaning on handling adversity in prior seasons:

We weren’t missing as many players back then, from Bosa to fred. That’s really tough, but there are experiences that a lot of our vets have gone through and it’s just your back’s against the wall, like what are you going to do?

On the defense’s game:

Shoutout to our defense. I though thtey played a phenomenal game and gave us plenty of opportunities. That’s why I’m so disappointed, because our offense didn’t back up our defense.

On the offense:

I have a ton of confidence in this offense and it just didn’t go our way tonight.

On the Seahawks celebrating in the locker room:

I would do the same (expletive). They won their division, they got the 1-seed, they won in a rival stadium. Good for them.

On the atmosphere at the stadium:

I thought our fans were fantastic. That was really loud Levi’s Stadium. They helped us out so much in the first half. I never blame the fans. We have to give them more to cheer for on offense.",https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/BNG-L-49ERS-0104_046da9.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2026-01-04 04:58:04.642674

Lamar Jackson will return from a one-game absence to help the Ravens in a must-win game against the Steelers. But a slew of players on teams eliminated from playoff contention are sitting out Week 18. The Jets' Breece Hall, the Cowboys' Javonte Williams and the Cardinals' Marvin Harrison Jr. won't suit up for the regular-season finale.

See who's in and who's out for Week 18:

QB Lamar Jackson (Ravens)

Practice schedule: Full-Full-Full

Injury: Back

Kickoff: 8:20 p.m. ET

Jackson will be active for the Ravens' Week 18 game against the Steelers. He'll return from a one-week absence due to a back injury and be thrusted into a win-or-go home game. Whoever is victorious between the Ravens and Steelers on Sunday night wins the AFC North title and earns the No. 4 seed in the conference.

QB J.J. McCarthy (Vikings)

Practice schedule: Limited-Full-Full

Injury: Hand

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

McCarthy will be active for the Vikings' Week 18 game against the Packers. He missed Week 17 with a right-hand injury, but will be back for Minnesota's regular-season finale. The Vikings are hoping to end the season on a five-game winning streak.

RB Javonte Williams (Cowboys)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Shoulder/Neck

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Williams will miss the Cowboys' final regular-season game against the Giants with injuries to his shoulder and neck. Williams sustained the injuries on Christmas Day against the Commanders.

RB De'Von Achane (Dolphins)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-Limited

Injury: Shoulder

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Achane will be active for the Dolphins' Week 18 game against the Patriots. He's dealing with a shoulder injury, but will tough it out for Miami's regular-season finale.

RB Breece Hall (Jets)

Practice schedule: DNP-Limited-Limited

Injury: Knee

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Hall will miss the Jets' Week 18 game against the Bills. It's his first absence of the 2025-26 season, in which he surpassed the 1,000-yard rushing mark for the first time in his career. Hall will be an unrestricted free agent following this season, so there's a possibility he's played his last snap for New York.

RB Omarion Hampton (Falcons)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Ankle

Kickoff: 4:25 p.m. ET

Hampton will be out for the Chargers' Week 18 game against the Broncos. He's dealing with an ankle injury and the Chargers can't gain any ground in the AFC playoff picture. Los Angeles is sitting a slew of starters, including Hampton and quarterback Justin Herbert.

RB Kyren Williams (Rams)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Full

Injury: Ankle

Kickoff: 4:25 p.m. ET

Williams will be active for the Rams' Week 18 game against the Cardinals. He sustained an ankle injury during the Rams' game against the Falcons last Monday night, but it shouldn't cost him any time. While Los Angeles can't win the NFC West, it is vying for position as the top Wild Card in the NFC.

TE Harold Fannin Jr. (Browns)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Groin

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Fannin will miss the Browns' Week 18 game against the Bengals. He re-aggravated a groin injury on a touchdown catch in Week 17. Before that, though, Fannin set the Browns' franchise rookie record for receptions, hauling in 72 catches this season.

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (Lions)

Practice schedule: DNP-Limited-Limited

Injury: Knee/Ankle

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

St. Brown will be active for the Lions' Week 18 game against the Bears. He's played through injury on numerous occasions this season, and will continue to do so on Sunday despite Detroit being eliminated from the playoffs.

WR Drake London (Falcons)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Knee

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

London will be active for the Falcons' Week 18 game against the Saints. He's dealing with a knee injury, but it won't prevent him from playing on Sunday. While Atlanta is eliminated from playoff contention, a win over the Saints would push the Carolina Panthers into the playoffs regardless of their result against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Saturday.

WR Rome Odunze (Bears)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-Limited

Injury: Foot

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Odunze will miss the Bears' Week 18 game against the Lions. This marks his sixth consecutive absence as he's dealing with a nagging foot injury. Chicago has been cautious with Odunze's recovery with the hope he'll return for the playoffs.

WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (Cardinals)

The NFC’s road to Super Bowl LX will go through Seattle for the first time since 2014, after the Seahawks smothered the NFL’s hottest offense in a 13-3 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in a pivotal regular-season finale at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif.

With the win, the Seahawks (14-3) secured the conference’s No. 1 seed, the lone first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, as well as their first NFC West title since 2020. Seattle also set a franchise record with 14 regular-season wins and improved to 15-2 on the road during coach Mike Macdonald’s two-year tenure.

With one day left in the NFL regular season, 12 of the 14 seeds in the postseason bracket remain undecided.

Nary a seed in the AFC has been solidified, including the No. 1 spot and the first-round bye that comes with it. That seed will go to either the Denver Broncos, New England Patriots or Jacksonville Jaguars, with the Jags the lone team that could land anywhere from No. 1 to No. 7 in the AFC.

The top seed in the NFC was finally decided Saturday night with the Seattle Seahawks’ win over the San Francisco 49ers in the Bay Area, but there’s plenty more to be determined in that conference, too. In fact, things are so absurd in the NFC South that a game between teams guaranteed to miss the playoffs will now determine whether the Carolina Panthers (8-9) or Tampa Bay Buccaneers (8-9) represent the division with the NFC’s No. 4 seed.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/yV9GFZvpFmam_OLHYfCTW4WQt_1440x960.jpg",N,,2026-01-04 04:58:16.315184

A game that was already going to be an uphill climb for San Francisco will now be a little tougher.","The San Francisco 49ers got some brutal injury news 90 minutes before their Week 18 showdown with the Seattle Seahawks.

Left tackle Trent Williams and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall were both ruled out after being listed as questionable on the injury report. Williams is dealing with a hamstring injury while Pearsall continues to battle knee and ankle issues.

It isn't a huge surprise that Williams is out. He hurt his hamstring on the team's first snap against the Chicago Bears in Week 17. On a short week it always appeared unlikely the 37-year-old would be able to suit up Saturday. He was also a non-participant in practice throughout the week.

It is a bit of a surprise Pearsall is out since he played well while battling the injuries in Week 17 with five catches for 85 yards. Then he was limited throughout the week in practice. This will be his 14th missed game in two seasons.

Here are the 49ers inactive players for Week 18:

LT Trent Williams (hamstring)

WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, ankle)

RB Isaac Guerendo

DE Robert Beal Jr.

DT Kevin Givens

LB Curtis Robinson

CB Chase Lucas

In a bit of good news, George Kittle is off the injury report and will play after missing Week 17 with an ankle injury. That's a great sign for San Francisco given how important Kittle is for both their pass and run games. He was listed as questionable on the injury report.

Defensive end Keion White and cornerback Upton Stout are also good to go after showing up as questionable on the injury report. White has a groin issue he's dealing with and Stout needed to clear concussion protocol before suiting up Saturday.

Missing Pearsall and Williams is tough for the 49ers while facing one of the best defenses in the NFL. Pearsall opens things up in their passing game with his ability to stretch the field vertically and get open in the middle of the field. Williams' absence wasn't felt much against Chicago, but having him out against Seattle will almost assuredly lead to some negative plays.

A game that was already going to be an uphill climb for San Francisco will now be a little tougher.","https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/20/SNIN/87853783007-usatsi-27817745.jpg?crop=4072,2291,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-04 04:58:19.377214

Williams' absence was expected after he didn't practice all week because of a right hamstring injury. Pearsall's was a bit more surprising because he was a limited participant in practice each day despite right knee and ankle injuries.

Tight end George Kittle (left ankle), defensive lineman Keion White (groin) and cornerback Upton Stout (concussion) were active after being listed as questionable.

Without Williams, the Niners turned to Austen Pleasants as the starter at left tackle. It was Pleasants' first start since entering the NFL as an undrafted free agent in 2020.

The Niners were held to 173 yards and nine first downs, while quarterback Brock Purdy passed for only 127 yards without a touchdown and also was intercepted and sacked three times against the Seahawks, who claimed the NFC West division crown, the No. 1 seed in the NFC, home-field advantage throughout the playoffs and a first-round bye.

On Thursday, Niners coach Kyle Shanahan said the team needed to be smart with Williams, acknowledging the importance of beating Seattle but also recognizing that it's not an elimination game and Williams will be needed at full strength for the postseason.

""It needs to be possible based off the doctors, and then it's got to be more on what Trent tells me,"" Shanahan said. ""I definitely don't want to lose any players for the following week knowing we're in the playoffs, but I also look at when you're playing to play one less playoff game, you can look at that as a playoff game. I know the season's not over if we lose, but you've still got to go play a game the next week on the road if you lose. And you can completely avoid that by winning. So, I see this as a playoff game too. I don't look at is as maybe that you'd lose him, you won't have him next week.""

Pearsall's situation has remained tenuous since he returned from a right knee injury in Week 11.

With the playoffs around the corner, and the Eagles guaranteed a spot in the Wild Card round, they have to be wise with their health. A player missing Sunday’s action might not be a bad scenario, but the Eagles still have a handful of players that are carrying some level of concern.

The 6 Eagles to Keep an Eye On

During Friday’s practice session, the Eagles missed six players. Each of them plays a key role for the team on Sundays.

1. Marcus Epps

The latest to land on the injury report. Marcus Epps is battling a concussion after reporting symptoms on Thursday. His status for next week’s game will depend on whether he can clear the protocol.

2. Jalen Carter

This season, Carter has battled health issues. He just returned from a multi-week absence last Sunday, and his impact was immediately felt. The good news is that Carter’s latest issue isn’t related to his most concerning setback of the season. He was unlikely to play on Sunday—injury or not.

3. Nakobe Dean

The Eagles didn’t have Dean in the picture until Week 7 this season. When they played the Commanders two weeks ago, he left after seeing the field for just 24 percent of the defensive snaps. He needs all of the rest and recovery he can get.

4. Lane Johnson

It’s been well over a month since Lane Johnson has taken the field. He is dealing with a foot injury, but returned to practice last week. However, Johnson hasn’t returned for game action and is now looking at the Wild Card round as his potential return to the field.

5. Dallas Goedert

The veteran tight end is dealing with a knee-related setback. All season long, Goedert has been consistent for the struggling Eagles offense. He was a rest candidate anyway. Goedert finishes the year with 60 catches for 591 yards and 11 touchdowns, marking a career high.

6. Jaelan Phillips

One of the top trade deadline pickups in the league this year, Phillips has been a major addition to the Eagles. He had an injury scare during last week’s outing in Buffalo. Phillips hasn’t practiced as he recovers from a minor ankle-related setback. His status moving forward is unclear.

The Steelers just lost to the Cleveland Browns in Week 17. Luckily, they'll have major reinforcements at home for their finale against Baltimore.

T.J. Watt injury update

Four-time All-Pro linebacker T.J. Watt will be back on the field for Pittsburgh in the biggest game of the season.

Watt was out of action for the last two weeks following surgery stemming from a partially collapsed lung on Dec. 10. That lung injury happened during a routine dry needling treatment at a team facility. He was subsequently hospitalized but has made a full recovery.

""It'll be great to have him back,"" Steelers defensive coordinator Teryl Austin said via the team. ""What capacity we'll find out really, not till Sunday. But it'll great to have him back... I would think that he'll only strengthen our group and how we play and all those things.""

Watt has just 7.0 sacks this season in 13 games - his fewest since recording 5.5 in 2022 in 10 games. That was the last time the Steelers failed to make the playoffs. The 2021 Defensive Player of the Year wasn't sure if he could play a week ago against Cleveland but told reporters he's ready for Sunday night.

""I'm excited to play,"" he said.

According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, he’s also looking to earn up to $1.5MM in incentives by throwing for at least 150 yards and three touchdowns and raising his passer rating (99.2) to 100. Unfortunately, he’ll be doing so without a few key pieces.

Backup swing tackle Josh Jones has played well in Cross’ absence these past two weeks and will be relied upon again in a winner-take-all matchup with the 49ers.

Curtis Crabtree of FOX Sports adds on that, although rookie fifth-round receiver Tory Horton is eligible to be activated off injured reserve, he is not expected to play again this season. The shin injury that’s kept him out since early November has likely ended his rookie campaign. Head coach Mike Macdonald told reporters, “The best way I can describe it is just, what he has, it just takes a long time to heal…we’re not planning on having him.”

The Vikings and the Green Bay Packers have both released their last injury reports ahead of Sunday afternoon’s game at U.S. Bank Stadium. Let’s take a look at everyone that’s been given an injury designation ahead of this one.

Green Bay Packers

OL Donovan Jennings - OUT (throat)

LB Nick Neimann* - OUT (pectoral)

G John Williams* - OUT (knee)

WR Savion Williams - OUT (foot/illness)

WR Dontayvion Wicks - DOUBTFUL (concussion)

OL Zach Tom - QUESTIONABLE (back/knee)

QB Malik Willis - QUESTIONABLE (right shoulder/hamstring)

Only one of the top two quarterbacks for the Packers has been given an injury designation for this one, but they’ve already declared that Jordan Love won’t play in this one despite being cleared. Some other big names for the Packers were not given injury designations after being limited for much of the week. Among them are linebacker Edgerrin Cooper, running back Josh Jacobs, and wide receiver Jayden Reed. But, as we’ve said all week, with the Packers not having anything to play for, those guys likely won’t play much if they play at all.

Minnesota Vikings

TE Gavin Bartholomew* - OUT (back)

TE T.J. Hockenson - OUT (shoulder)

RB Aaron Jones - OUT (hip)

WR Myles Price - OUT (ankle)

CB Dwight McGlothern - QUESTIONABLE (hip)

McGlothern was just added to the injury report today. The team has added cornerback Zemaiah Vaughn to the active roster from the practice squad, so he’ll be up on Sunday in the event that McGlothern can’t go. The team has also added Taki Taimani to the active roster as well. Bartholomew will, officially, miss his entire rookie season with the back injury he’s been dealing with all year long.

The big news, of course, is that quarterback J.J. McCarthy does not have an injury designation, and Kevin O’Connell has announced that he will, in fact, start on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. We’ll see if he can give himself something positive to build on as the team heads into the offseason.

The Kansas City Chiefs are entering an uncertain offense, primarily because of quarterback Patrick Mahomes' crushing knee injury.

Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL during Kansas City's Week 15 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, and though the All-Pro signal-caller is targeting a Week 1 return in 2026, it remains to be seen if that comes to fruition.

Even if Mahomes is ready for the season opener, the Chiefs would be foolish not to add another quarterback to the roster this offseason, as Gardner Minshew will also be a free agent.

FOX Sports' Ralph Vacchiano has a bold prediction for who Kansas City will sign to fill in for Mahomes until he's back from his knee injury.

Vacchiano predicts the Chiefs will bring in Philip Rivers for one last ride.

""Rivers will send out feelers to let teams know he wants to keep playing at least one more season. And that’s when he’ll get a surprising offer: Come to Kansas City and be a placeholder until Patrick Mahomes returns from his torn ACL. The chance to potentially play for Andy Reid and maybe even ride along on a Super Bowl quest will be too much to pass up,"" Vacchiano wrote.

Rivers shocked the football world when he came out of retirement in December to play for the Indianapolis Colts. The 44-year-old went 0-3 as the Colts' starting quarterback, tossing four touchdowns to three interceptions with a 63% completion rate.

Though Rivers stated that he will go back to retirement after the 2025 season, we've seen crazier things happen. If Rivers changes his mind and decides to come back for one more year in 2026, Kansas City would be a logical landing spot for the future Hall of Famer.

Rivers would be a solid option to fill in for Mahomes if the Chiefs' superstar quarterback can't return to begin the 2026 campaign. The eight-time Pro Bowler would gel well with Andy Reid, who played against Rivers for years and knows him well.

Obviously, the chance of this happening is low, as Rivers is no longer a viable long-term starter, but never say never.

,,2026-01-03 19:27:56+00:00,The Seattle Times,Seahawks rookie WR Tory Horton unlikely to return from injury this season,Bob Condotta,,,,,https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/seahawks-rookie-wr-tory-horton-unlikely-to-return-from-injury-this-season/,"RENTON — Seahawks rookie receiver Tory Horton will likely not return this season due to a shin injury that has caused him to miss the past eight games, coach Mike Macdonald said Friday.
But Macdonald said the following week that Horton suffered an injury in that game that got worse.
“Best way I can describe it is what he has, it just takes a long time to heal,” Macdonald said of Horton.
“To my understanding it was a good exam right there at the game,” Macdonald said.
Just let us know.’ And we did and the guys executed it, so I thought we’ve had a great week.”","RENTON — Seahawks rookie receiver Tory Horton will likely not return this season due to a shin injury that has caused him to miss the past eight games, coach Mike Macdonald said Friday.

Horton last played Nov. 2 against Washington and was placed on injured reserve two weeks later.

That made him eligible to return at any time during the past three weeks and the team had seemed to hold out the hope publicly that he might make it back. But that changed Friday.

“Put it this way, we’re planning on not having him and if something happens, which we’re not counting on, and he’s able to come back, that’s great,” Macdonald said following Friday’s practice. “But right now we’re planning on not having him. Just needs time and rest, so it’s unfortunate but these things happen. We’re with him. He’s doing a great job. Just not going to have him right now.”

A fifth-round pick out of Colorado State, Horton spent the first half of the season as Seattle’s third receiver, making 13 receptions for 161 yards with five touchdowns, and also was the primary punt returner, returning one for a 95-yard TD in Week 3 against New Orleans.

He had his best game with four receptions for 48 yards and a 25-yard touchdown Nov. 2 against the Commanders before being sidelined. Horton played a season-high 37 snaps against the Commanders in a game that Cooper Kupp missed. But Macdonald said the following week that Horton suffered an injury in that game that got worse.

“It was a lingering issue from the game, and that’s probably the best way to put it,” Macdonald said that week.

Two days after that game the Seahawks acquired veteran Rashid Shaheed in a trade with the Saints, and Shaheed has taken over the third receiver and punt-return roles.

“Best way I can describe it is what he has, it just takes a long time to heal,” Macdonald said of Horton.

Shaheed entered this week as a question mark after he suffered a concussion and was sidelined for the last three quarters of last Sunday’s 27-10 win at Carolina.

But he was not on the game status report released Thursday and is cleared to play Saturday against the 49ers.

“To my understanding it was a good exam right there at the game,” Macdonald said. “So I know he’s confident on where he’s at and feels great and he’s had a good week, so I think he’s in a good spot.”

The Seahawks also put receiver Cody White on injured reserve this week with a groin injury, and Macdonald confirmed Friday that White is also out for the season.

That leaves Seattle with five receivers on its current 53-man roster: Shaheed, Kupp, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Jake Bobo and Dareke Young.

Jones making progress but still questionable

Macdonald kept it somewhat vague on the status of offensive tackle Josh Jones, who is listed as questionable for Saturday’s game with knee and ankle issues.

Jones was able to practice on a limited basis Thursday, and the team held a day-before-game light walk-through Friday and did not have to release a practice report via league rules.

“He’s doing good, doing good,” Macdonald said of Jones, who has started the past two games in place of injured starter Charles Cross. “He’s progressing.”

But asked if Jones will play Saturday, Macdonald said only: “It’s questionable if he’s going to play. He’s progressing. The injury report is what it is. We’ll stick with it right now.”

Cross will miss his third straight game with a hamstring injury suffered Dec. 18 against the Colts.

But Macdonald said the team hopes Cross can return for the first playoff game, which will either be next weekend if Seattle loses to the 49ers on Saturday, or the following weekend if the Seahawks win.

“We’re optimistic for next week or the week after for Charles,” Macdonald said.

Bryant ‘doing well’; Diggs might be available

Macdonald also said that safety Quandre Diggs “could” be available for Saturday’s game. He has not played since Nov. 30 due to a thigh injury. Seattle has just four safeties on its 53-man roster after D’Anthony Bell was claimed off waivers this week by Carolina.

But one of those four, Coby Bryant, is listed as doubtful with a knee injury that held him out against the Panthers.

Macdonald said Bryant is “doing well. He’s done as much as he can this week and then we’ll just keep going.”

Seattle’s depth issues at safety might mean the team would turn to Diggs but Macdonald noted he is still recovering from his injury.

“He could, yeah,” he said when asked about Diggs potentially being available for the 49ers game. “He’s coming back from his injury as well, so we’re working through that.”

Seahawks-49ers to get experienced ref

A significant X factor in any football game is the officiating crew.

Maybe due to the magnitude of the game, the NFL assigned one of its most experienced refs, Bill Vinovich, to oversee it.

The 65-year-old first began working in the NFL in 2001 and has been a referee for 17 seasons, including every year since 2012. Among his assignments have been three Super Bowls, including Seattle’s loss to the Patriots in 2015 and the 49ers’ loss to the Chiefs in 2024.

He has done four Seahawks games over the past three seasons — Seattle has won them all, including a 38-14 win Nov. 2 at Washington.

As detailed by nflrefstats1 on social media, Vinovich’s crews have traditionally been near the bottom in average penalties per game but this year are third at 13.58 and are first in calling offensive pass interference and second in enforcing special teams penalties and illegal block in the back.

Short week worked out well, Macdonald says

Both teams found out late Sunday night that they would have to play Saturday night. That caused the Seahawks to have to compress their schedule some, turning what is normally an off-day Tuesday into a workday that included a walk-through, then holding what was a somewhat-modified Thursday-style practice Wednesday and what was a usual Friday-style practice Thursday.

“The guys did a great job,” Macdonald said. “We were talking about the process and changed the calendar a little bit and guys were like: ‘Look, we’ll do whatever. Just let us know.’ And we did and the guys executed it, so I thought we’ve had a great week.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01022026_tzr_tzr_135245.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2026-01-03 17:59:24.410853

Schwesinger had originally been ruled out of the Browns' finale Jan. 4 at the Cincinnati Bengals. A day later, they placed him on injured reserve in order to sign linebacker Edefuan Ulofoshio to the active roster off the practice squad.

“Yeah, I mean this kid, as you guys know, has been unbelievable,"" coach Kevin Stefanski said Jan. 2. ""So, for him to play in that game with the injury he had is absolutely remarkable. And then he just can’t go this week. So, I cannot say enough good things about Carson Schwesinger. I’ve said a lot of good things. It’s just incredible what he means to the middle of this defense. He’s just a great kid. But in context now, with the injury he had, for him to play in that game the way he did his unbelievable.”

Buy Cleveland Browns tickets

The Browns also elevated tight end Sal Cannella to the gameday roster off the practice squad. Both rookie Harold Fannin Jr. (groin) and David Njoku (knee) have been ruled out against the Bengals.

There was some good news in that veteran guard Teven Jenkins cleared concussion protocol and will start at right guard. Jenkins had originally been ruled questionable for the game, but no longer has an injury status.

Schwesinger, when asked a day after a Week 17 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers couldn't exactly pinpoint when the injury happened in the first half. However, the CBS broadcast showed a replay of Schwesinger coming up limping after planting his foot to run on a third-down pass play on the first play of the second quarter during a sideline report on the thigh injury.

Although it may have initially been a noncontact injury, subsequent hits only exacerbated the issue. The limp became substantially more pronounced as the second quarter went along.

""I mean, halftime I was able to go in and put a pad over it and wrap,"" Schwesinger said. ""And so that always helps. And then I think sometimes with things, you just kind of get used to it and I think that helps, too.""

Schwesinger played all 66 defensive snaps for the Browns, despite the injury. The heavy favorite for NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year finished tied with fellow linebacker Devin Bush with nine combined tackles, snapping what had been an NFL-best six-game streak of recording double-digit tackles.

Schwesinger leads all rookies with 146 total tackles and 11 tackles for loss, while adding two interceptions and 2.5 sacks. He recorded double-digit tackles in seven games this year, including a stretch of six consecutive games, the longest streak in the NFL this season.

Ulofoshio is in his second NFL season out of Washington. Originally selected by Buffalo in the fourth round of the 2024 draft, he has appeared in four career games.

Are you buying that the losing coach is on the hot seat — or gone — after this game?","The Athletic has live coverage of Panthers vs. Buccaneers and Seahawks vs. 49ers from NFL Week 18 action.

Four division titles and both conference’s top seeds hanging in the balance should be enough to satiate even the biggest appetite for high-stakes action in Week 18.

But there is plenty more to watch in the 2025 season’s ultimate week.

Just one sack away from setting the single-season record (22.5), Myles Garrett has one more shot at pass-rushing immortality as the Cleveland Browns face the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday. If Garrett misses the mark, though, how will his performance be viewed historically in an otherwise forgettable Browns campaign?

It also gets a little hotter at the final whistle for any head coach sitting on a warm seat this week. That could include two of the league’s most consistent winners in Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh and Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin. Could the losing coach of the teams’ AFC North title clash on Sunday night be in trouble?

Our NFL writers Zak Keefer, Jeff Howe and Mike Sando have plenty to say in this week’s roundtable previewing Week 18’s game. Read more below.

The Bucs meet the Panthers on Saturday and the NFC South winner could finish under .500 and host a playoff game. The idea of the league re-seeding for the postseason might be a topic of conversation once again. Where do you stand on that? Does the league have it right or should the Lions’ proposal from May be revisited?

Keefer: I’m 100% with the Lions on this — teams shouldn’t be punished for playing in tougher divisions, and wins shouldn’t be discounted. They’re simply too hard to come by. Philip Rivers actually brought up this topic a few weeks ago in Indianapolis, mentioning the time his 8-8 Chargers team hosted a 12-4 Colts team in the wild-card round. The Lions’ proposal pertains to the second-round games, but the point stands. I’m all for division winners earning their spot in the playoffs, but that doesn’t mean a losing team should be hosting a game against one that won three or four more games during the regular season.

Howe: While the record-based seeding is the fairer of the two, I still think a division title should carry more distinction, and the home playoff game is a suitable reward. This is typically a reactionary topic in the rare instance when a team with a bad record wins a division, but few seem to care when the model works according to plan. I’ve never felt strongly about this topic, though, because there are really good cases for each side. Another perk for record-based seeding: There’d be a few more meaningful games this weekend.

Sando: The best solution to this problem is to win your division. I’ve got no issue with the current setup. It’s the sort of thing that comes up when a specific team has a great record and feels slighted because a division-winning team has a lesser record.

The NFC West and NFC’s No. 1 seed is on the line when the 49ers and Seahawks meet. But does the winning team’s coach have the best case for Coach of the Year as well? Kyle Shanahan would have an injury-riddled 49ers team atop the conference. Oddsmakers had the Seahawks at 7.5 wins in August.

Keefer: Shanahan is my Coach of the Year, with Mike Vrabel a close second. I think it’s the most competitive race for this award in a decade, maybe longer. Ben Johnson deserves a seat at the table, as does Sean Payton, Liam Coen and DeMeco Ryans. Macdonald has been tremendous in Seattle, and if they win Saturday night, I have no issue with him bringing home the award. But I’m picking the 49ers in this one because of how well Brock Purdy is playing of late, and Christian McCaffrey remains the most productive high-volume player in the league. San Francisco looks Super Bowl-good right now. Shanahan’s never done a better job, and that’s saying quite a lot.

Howe: This is an awesome race for Coach of the Year because there are about 10 guys who have legitimate cases. And without a consensus favorite for the Super Bowl — in either conference — voters can’t just defer to the coach on the best team. If you’re going with the coach who has done the most after entering the season with the lowest expectations, Liam Coen, Mike Vrabel, Ben Johnson and Mike Macdonald have to be leading the way. I’d have to see how the weekend played out before deciding because it’s too close to call.

Sando: It’ll be hard to ignore Shanahan if his 49ers beat the Seahawks to claim the top seed after missing so many key players for long stretches, including Brock Purdy. Mike Vrabel has a really strong case as well. I’ll wait til the season is over before making a decision.

Myles Garrett has one more shot at the single-sack record. The Bengals might pull out all the stops to leave Garrett sack-less (even if it cost them the game like it did for the Steelers). If he misses the record, how are we viewing Garrett’s season among the all-time great edge rushers?

Keefer: I can’t recall the last time I saw Myles Garrett face a single lineman. It’s always a minimum of two, even three, with plenty of chip blocks thrown in there somewhere. Offenses know how quickly he can wreck a game. His season has been remarkable any way you slice it. The only shame is he’s doing it on a four-win Browns team that will miss the playoffs for the seventh time in his nine seasons. The all-time greats Garrett has put himself in company with — pass rushers like Reggie White and Michael Strahan — won Super Bowls. If Garrett sets the record Sunday, it should be celebrated. But it’d mean more if the stakes were higher.

Howe: Not unlike one of the Jets’ wasted seasons with Darrelle Revis, or J.J. Watt with the Texans or Larry Fitzgerald with the Cardinals, when people wondered if one of the generation’s most impactful performers will ever make more than one playoff appearance per election cycle. Garrett is on his way to going down as an all-time great, but pass rushers have a distinguished place in the game’s history. To be compared to the best of the best across generations, Garrett needs to play for a winner.

Sando: I feel like it’s one more dominant season from an all-time great player. Whether Garrett has 14, 18, 21 or 25 sacks means less to me for a player of that caliber. The difference between 22 and 23 could help Garrett’s legacy hold up better in the distant future, when fewer people appreciate what he brought to the game. Either way, he’s been great the whole time.

The Chargers (at Broncos) are resting starters. With Josh Allen’s lingering foot injury in mind, the Bills (vs. Jets) could do something similar. Those won’t be the only teams weighing whether or not to play starters. Is resting players always the smart move in Week 18 for playoff teams or does seeding matter this year more than ever?

Keefer: It didn’t seem like Allen was quite himself in the second half of Sunday’s loss to the Eagles, so if I’m Sean McDermott, I’m sitting him. He’s their ticket come January, and Allen at 100% is enough to push the Bills to their first Super Bowl appearance since 1994. With no Patrick Mahomes or Joe Burrow in this year’s AFC playoff field — and if the Ravens lose Sunday night, no Lamar Jackson — the door is open. A healthy Allen gives the Bills their best shot. It doesn’t matter where they have to play, no one in football tilts the field quite like him.

Howe: If the Chargers win and the Patriots and Jaguars hold serve against inferior opponents, the Chargers’ reward would be a return to Denver in the wild-card round. That’s a daunting scenario for any division opponent. For the Bills, resting Allen should be the obvious call. They need a win and a Texans loss to Indy to jump into the No. 5 seed for a wild-card trip to the AFC North winner, so that’s a long shot. Intriguingly, if the Bills rest Allen and lose to the Jets — still not a given — and the other AFC playoff teams hold serve, they’d be setting up a first-round trip to New England.

Sando: Seeding matters less with only one bye instead of two. Every team needs to weigh the risks. Having a healthier Josh Allen could be the most important thing for Buffalo, so resting him makes sense. I agree with Chicago playing its starters because the Bears are trying to establish something under a first-year coach. They have not arrived. Keep playing. Having something to play for, however minor, makes it easier to justify.

The Steelers and Ravens meet for the AFC North title on Sunday night. The loser’s season comes to a very disappointing end and perhaps a new direction is up for discussion. Are you buying that the losing coach is on the hot seat — or gone — after this game?

Keefer: I’ve never got the inkling that Steelers ownership has even considered moving on from Mike Tomlin, so if he’s not the coach there next year, it’s because it was his call, not theirs. A disastrous end could lead to some tough discussions for a team that leads the league in defensive spending year after year but hasn’t found a running game or a solid offensive line in a while. Aaron Rodgers has Band-Aided the Steelers’ QB issue for a few months, but he’s not a long-term answer. If this season ends the way the last one did — with a blowout loss to the Ravens — the furor will rise in Pittsburgh, and I could see it being the end for Tomlin. The Dolphins or Titans would be wise to scoop him up as fast as possible.

Howe: I don’t think the result should matter with Tomlin or Harbaugh. Should a wild-card exit move the needle? Or even a trip to the divisional round? When it’s time to consider parting with an organizational institution — one who has maintained a Super Bowl standard — the decision must be about far more than the outcome of a game or two in early January. Is the message still being received? Are the visions still aligned? Are all parties still getting the best out of every relationship in the building? If they’re not and it’s been trending this way for a while, delaying the inevitable wouldn’t serve the best interest of the organization or the coach in question.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/02190013/Week-18-roundtable-Saturday-NFL.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-03 16:58:15.970772

I'm still hopeful that Clayton Tune will help us end the regular season on a high note.

I almost ended the column right here.

Jeff from Pleasant Hill, IA

""Tune"" in Sunday?

OK, OK, OK…puns aside, I can't wait to see it. Tune is a young quarterback who came here looking for opportunity and Green Bay provided it in gold trim. It won't be easy against Brian Flores' front, but it never is. You gotta capitalize. While Tune is the most obvious storyline given the nature of his position, there are two dozen young players like him who'll get reps Sunday they might not otherwise see in the playoffs. I can't wait to watch the likes of Matthew Golden, Collin Oliver, Brenton Cox Jr., Ty'Ron Hopper, Bo Melton, Jonathan Ford and Kitan Oladapo get more work. I get it's not a traditional Week 18 matchup, but Sunday's game is what the NFL is all about: Opportunity.

Phillip from Wonder Lake, IL

Can it really be possible for the Packers to rest most of the main players for the last game of the season and come back and play at the first game of the playoffs against either team that they already lost to at least once?

Yes.

Ben from Pittsfield, MA

Best scenario/outcome from the Vikings game?

Get out healthy of U.S. Bank Stadium healthy. The rest is extra credit at this point.

Kerry from Canyon Lake, TX

Packers currently sit at three straight losses. We sit our starters at MN for a fourth straight loss (I get the health thing). Then we head into a playoff road game which is likely a loss. Is that how we want to end the season? Five straight losses. Play our team and beat the Vikings! Just a thought.

The final outcome of Sunday's game is irrelevant if the Packers don't win in the wild-round round. With all the injuries Green Bay has suffered this season, I'd say resting key players in an irrelevant game in regards to the standings puts the Packers in the best position to move forward in the postseason. The Packers haven't had much luck in the good fortune dept., but this is a chance to rest up and the closest thing they're gonna get to a reprieve.

Jason from Boyle, MS

Nice addition with Trevon Diggs. Nice to see these moves being made for a playoff run with all the injuries we have right now. Change is inevitable.

Sometimes the next man up is somebody no one expected. Green Bay has lost a lot through the course of this season, but Thursday felt like it gained something back. Let's see what the Packers and Diggs make of it.

Scot from Rice Lake, WI

I feel Trevon Diggs signing reminds me of Andre Rison signing late in season. Andre filled a void we had on a previous run to the top, could Trevon fire up an injury-riddled defense?

While it wasn't the playoffs, I think back to the boost Rasul Douglas gave the Packers back in 2021. There were serious questions about what would happen at cornerback after losing Jaire Alexander for the remainder of the regular season to the shoulder injury. Douglas solved all of that. As Spoff outlined, this is the perfect time for the Packers and Diggs to unite. Both need something from the other. It goes without saying Diggs has the ball skills to make his presence felt on defense immediately if given the opportunity.

Dave from Wheaton, IL

Not a question, but here's hoping that Diggs is this year's Howard Green, but with a better fitting uniform.

Diggs looked good in that ""28"" in practice. Hopefully, it fits well this Sunday.

Joe from Dartford, UK

Just watched the Trevon Diggs locker room interview and wow, he interviewed well. He came across as a humble, unassuming guy who wants to help this team. I don't know where the ""bad attitude"" chat comes from. Were you impressed by his interview? Also, does he slot in as our No. 2 corner or is that too much to ask, too soon? Thanks II for all you do.

We'll see where he fits on defense. I am hopeful Diggs has picked up enough of the scheme to get in there Sunday. But I was super impressed with how Diggs has conducted himself – not only with us but also just seeing him interact with teammates and coaches at practice and in the locker room.

Herbert from Palm Desert, CA

Good morning, Wes. I've seen several comments questioning the character of Trevon Diggs. If Micah Parsons considers him a brother, that's good enough for me. For you as well?

I couldn't give two sheets of loose-leaf paper what social media has to say on many things, but especially as it pertains to individuals I cover. Because I'm gonna get that answer soon enough. Reputations may precede people, but it doesn't define them. For all the couch critics of Parsons when the Packers traded for him, I've found Micah to be nothing but thoughtful and respectful since he's gotten here. He thinks the world of Diggs. I'll take his word over user34235624 with 10,000 comments and six followers.

Logan from Tribune, KS

Stylistically how does Diggs' skill set fit into Hafley's defense? How do you see them utilizing him down the stretch? A big ask for a corner to join the squad this late! Excited to see it play out. Go Pack Go!

We'll just have to find out either this Sunday or in the weeks that follow. What I do know is Hafley is one of the very best when it comes to determining what a player does well and building around those strengths within his scheme.

Ben from Cripple Creek, CO

If Rasheed Walker, Zach Tom, and Aaron Banks all do rest, it would be nice to get to see maybe Jordan Morgan at one of the T spots, and a couple other young players get some reps across the line. Good work with communication and fundamentals against this MIN team.

I would assume Morgan stays at the position he's been playing at right tackle. Maybe that changes if the Packers rest Walker, but again there's only so many players Green Bay can sit. Some veterans will have to play just based on the roster numbers.

Joseph from Duryea, PA

Where does the Pack rank on third-down defense efficiency? It's a killer every week. That is part of total defense, right?

The Packers fell to 18th (40.4%) after Baltimore went 10-of-14 (71.4%) last week. The defense has to get the train back on the tracks.

Doug from Neenah, WI

Good morning, Wes. There's been a lot of discussion lately about the lack of turnovers by the Packers' defense this season, especially when it was a point of emphasis during practices. I'm not sure if it's the other side of the same coin but the Packers rank near the top of the league in not missing tackles. Isn't that equally important? Thanks.

The Packers haven't generated enough turnovers this year. I'm not dismissing that. But one of the defense's biggest strengths this season has been eliminating explosive plays. Not missing tackles is a key part of that. At the same time, when you look at the games where the defense has struggled, it's been largely due to missed tackles and not capitalizing on takeaway opportunities. Green Bay needs to lock in on both areas to make a run this month.

Mark from Shoreview, MN

Just wondering, is there any way we could talk Malik Willis into wanting to play in the AFC next year?

I'd say that's preferable, but just hoping the best for Willis regardless of what happens. He's been a total pro and the best performing backup QB I've covered in Green Bay.

Michael from Shawano, WI

Gents, is it just me, or is this locker room one of the most cohesive, laid back, all business, positive, genuine, locked in, mature (for youngest team) teams in recent history?

It is and I think that continuity is what's propelled this team to the playoffs despite a rash of injuries to key players.

Robin from Ashburn, VA

What to expect against Vikings?

It'll be J.J. McCarthy under center and I imagine he'll want to end his first full season as Minnesota starting quarterback on a high note. The Vikings won't have T.J. Hockenson or Aaron Jones available, but that entire receiving corps will be there for McCarthy. As much as we talked about Brian Flores' defense presenting a stiff test to Tune and Co., the Packers' defenders have their work cut out for them, as well.

Troy from Ninety Six, SC

I'm curious about the contract status of Trevon Diggs and Desmond Ridder. Do they have years left on their contracts after this year or are they unrestricted free agents? If years left, I think that was a wise move by BG, offering flexibility at two key positions of need. If free agents, do they play into the compensatory pick formula seeing as they'll only have one game on the roster?

Ridder is on the practice squad, so the Packers will need to sign him to a futures contract to keep him around this offseason. The extension Diggs signed with Dallas runs through 2028 but there's no guaranteed money past this year.

Bart from Appleton, WI

Great job answering questions! As the playoffs are upon us, can you please explain the overtime rule about each team's possession of the ball. Say the Packers get the ball first, drive down and score a touchdown and chew up roughly eight minutes on the drive. Does the opponent get only the remaining time of the first overtime period, or does a second period kick in?

In the playoffs, overtimes consist of 15-minute periods until a winner is decided. Each team has three timeouts in a half (two overtime periods).

James from Chicago, IL

When a player is claimed off the waiver wire and is expected to play just a few days later, how does it work with HR? Do they have to come in right away and meet with HR, fill out their W-2, get their iPad and employee badge, get an orientation walk-through of the facility so they know where the copy machine, bathrooms, and locker rooms are?

The Packers' football operations have people for all that to make the transition as easy as possible for the player, whose agent also assists in those matters.

Derek from South Point, OH

Wes, I wrote in 2020 about Austen Pleasants, only the second student from where I teach to make the NFL. He was an undrafted FA. After bouncing around multiple teams since then, he has found a home in SF. He came in on Sunday when Trent Williams went down and played well, even getting a shout out during the locker room speech. He's getting praised for his work, especially coming in early this week. We are so proud of ""Big Red."" His is one of those wonderful stories you don't always hear.

You've given me a reason to pull for the Niners. Congrats on Austen's success.

Jessi from Sterling, KS

I wonder if Matt and Co. realize they have so much to thank you two for in at least keeping a portion of the Packer fans base somewhat sane. You help with objective perspective through the season (and offseason!). Probably not, but I wish someone would tell them how loved you two are! Speaking of that, thank you for the latest ""Unscripted"" and once again bringing me better perspective. I know you guys need a recoup time too, but in the offseason it's one of the things I miss the most every week.

John from Belleview, FL

It's been said that the past cannot be changed, and the future cannot be known. That's why today is called the ""present."" So, let's treat each week's game as a present to be unwrapped and enjoyed. To do otherwise is asking for disappointment. Happy New Year to your entire team and thank you to all who contribute to this forum that keeps the ""social"" in ""social media.""

Kathryn from Greenville, WI

Is there any song more annoying than ""Skol, Vikings Skol""?

Al from Green Bay, WI

In response to Bill from Raleigh (Tuesday's II column), I'll blow right past the ""Tune-up"" game vs. Minnesota and address his request. Reasons to believe the Pack can win the Super Bowl this year: 1) The 27-year-old Jordan Love is entering his prime, and he's good! 2) Jeff Hafley's defense has played well, despite the lack of turnovers. If that turnover faucet can be turned on, look out! 3) Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed, etc. Playmakers across the board! 4) Josh Jacobs/Emanuel Wilson will provide the balanced attack. 5) While Week 18 isn't a bye, it's a chance for key players to get a needed reprieve and go into the playoffs healthy and rested. 6) With only one recent exception, GB has lost only the games in which they beat themselves. This is a talented team! 7) See ""2010 Packers season."" It's a great reminder that seeding only matters until the ball is kicked off! Let's do this thing! GPG!

I see the Packers giving themselves a chance to give themselves a chance. Take a breath and enjoy the game, everyone.

On Friday, the Patriots ruled four players out for their final regular season game of the year this Sunday against the Miami Dolphins.

Guard Jared Wilson (concussion protocol), defensive lineman Khyiris Tonga (foot), and linebackers Harold Landry (knee) and Robert Spillane (ankle) won't play in this one. That list is highlighted by Spillane, who hasn't played since the Week 13 game against the New York Giants heading into the bye week. Spillane dressed and was active for the Week 15 game against the Bills but did not play a snap.

Spillane did get on the practice field on Friday, his first time doing so since that Bills game. Head coach Mike Vrabel discussed his return to the practice field Friday afternoon.

""When you go through an injury and you're away from the team, guys that care a lot about the team want to be out there,"" Vrabel said. ""So, just trying to get the return to play, and felt good enough to get out there and do a little bit of work in a limited fashion. So, I think that was positive and excited that he's feeling better.""

The Patriots also have two players listed as questionable in fullback Jack Westover (ankle) and cornerback Charles Woods (foot). Westover missed the first two days of practice this week then was limited on Friday. Woods was also limited on Friday, as a new addition to the report.

Then there's the status of the three players set to return from IR - tackle Will Campbell (knee), defensive tackle Milton Williams (ankle), and cornerback Alex Austin (wrist). Campbell was a full participant all week, and Williams was a full participant on Friday after being limited to start the week. Austin was limited all week.

""We'll see how they respond from today's work,"" Vrabel said on Friday when asked if Williams or Campbell would be activated for Sunday's game. ""Tried to get them a full week of work in, but I think it looks good. Both of them were able to work the whole week and we'll see where we're at tomorrow.""

The deadline for players to be activated for this Sunday is 4 p.m. ET on Saturday. There is currently one open roster spot on the 53-man roster for the Patriots. If any of the players are not activated, they still have the opportunity to be activated for the playoffs.

On the other side of the injury report, Miami ruled safety Minkah Fitzpatrick (calf) out for the game and listed running back De'Von Achane (shoulder) as doubtful after neither player practiced this week.

Green Bay Packers (9-6) vs. Minnesota Vikings (8-8) — Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS

Spread: Vikings -7.5 | Over/Under: 36.5

Are the Packers Resting Starters?

Green Bay has clinched the No. 7 slot in the NFC. With that said, the Packers are expected to rest starters as they prep for the postseason with a 9.09x payout to win the NFC, via PrizePicks Team Picks.

Packers QB Jordan Love cleared concussion protocol but will not play on Sunday. Backup QB Malik Willis (shoulder/hamstring) is questionable and WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion) holds a doubtful status. RB Josh Jacobs (knee/ankle) and WR Jayden Reed (illness) have been cleared, but their potential workloads remain up in the air as of Saturday morning.

Are the Vikings Resting Starters?

Despite the Vikings being eliminated from playoff contention in Week 15, there’s been no indication of Minnesota resting starters for Sunday’s NFC North clash. As 7.5-point favorites, the Vikings aim to add to their four-game winning streak.

This roster is not without injuries, though, as RB Aaron Jones (hip) and TE T.J. Hockenson (shoulder) will miss the season finale.

Indianapolis Colts (8-8) vs. Houston Texans (11-5) — Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, CBS

Spread: Texans -10.5 | Over/Under: 39.5

Are the Colts Resting Starters?

Following six consecutive losses, Indianapolis will bench QB Philip Rivers and start rookie QB Riley Leonard. Outside of a QB evaluation, the Colts are looking to roll out their starters.

Are the Texans Resting Starters?

Houston has plenty at stake in Week 18. The Texans could clinch the AFC South and earn the No. 3 seed with a win and a Jaguars loss. A win from Houston will guarantee at least the fifth seed, but a loss would put the Texans in play for the sixth and seventh spots.

Texans CB Kamari Lassiter (ankle/knee) could be the lone starter out; RT Trent Brown (ankle/knee, questionable) is the only other one that could sit. Houston, trying to keep up its momentum, has emerged as a Super Bowl sleeper with a 10x payout to win it all, per PrizePicks Team Picks.

Dallas Cowboys (7-8-1) vs. New York Giants (3-13) — Sunday, 1 p.m. ET, FOX

Spread: Cowboys -3.5 | Over/Under: 48.5

Are the Cowboys Resting Starters?

There’s been no official indication that the Cowboys will rest starters in bulk. While Dallas QB Dak Prescott is expected to start, he hinted at not playing the entire game. Second-string QB Joe Milton may get some time under center.

If Milton takes over the offense, key starters like WRs CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens could move to the bench, too. RB Javonte Williams (shoulder/neck) was ruled out on Friday, while TE Jake Ferguson (calf) was cleared to play.

Are the Giants Resting Starters?

Following last week’s 34-10 win against the Raiders, New York’s chance of securing the No. 1 pick for the 2026 NFL Draft dropped to 20%, via ESPN Analytics. The Giants’ days of “tanking” for the top selection look to be over, as proven by interim coach Mike Kafka stating he plans to play starters “all the way through.”

New York has a long list of injuries, with WR Wan’Dale Robinson (rib), TE Theo Johnson (illness), DE Rakeem Nunez-Roches (ankle/toe), S Jevon Holland, and CB Cor’Dale Flott (knee) all out. Superstar DT Dexter Lawrence did not practice on Thursday and Friday due to illness, putting his status in question.

Arizona Cardinals (3-13) vs. Los Angeles Rams (11-5) — Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET, FOX

Spread: Rams -7.5 | Over/Under: 44.5

Are the Cardinals Resting Starters?

As one of four teams sitting at 3-13, Arizona is in contention for a top-five 2026 NFL Draft pick. Despite that, the Cardinals are not expected to rest starters.

The starting lineup will be without WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel) and LG Evan Brown (personal). DE Josh Sweat (ankle/knee) is questionable for Sunday.

Are the Rams Resting Starters?

Los Angeles is out of contention in the NFC West and will have a wild-card seed for the playoffs. That would lead many to believe starters will rest, yet head coach Sean McVay quickly stated starters will play following Week 17’s loss against the Falcons.

Perhaps the Rams will look to rest players in the second half with a big lead. For now, we have to assume key players will be in action. According to the injury report, RB Kyren Williams (ankle), RB Blake Corum (ankle), and WR Davante Adams (hamstring) are questionable.

Washington Commanders (4-12) vs. Philadelphia Eagles (11-5) — Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS

Spread: Eagles -3.5 | Over/Under: 39.5

Will the Commanders Rest Starters?

Washington is another team in tank territory, carrying a 4-12 record, yet the Commanders are expected to roll out most of their starters.

On offense, though, Washington QB Jayden Daniels (elbow) and QB Marcus Mariota (hand/quad) will be out, leaving the offense to third-string QB Josh Johnson.

Will the Eagles Rest Starters?

With the NFC East locked up, Philadelphia is one of few teams expected to rest most of its starters. The Eagles could still secure the No. 2 seed with a win and a Bears loss. At worst, Philly will carry the third seed in the NFC.

Resting players could include key cogs like QB Jalen Hurts, RB Saquon Barkley, WR A.J. Brown, and WR DeVonta Smith. Injuries include Philadelphia TE Dallas Goedert (knee), DT Jalen Carter (hip), EDGE Jaelan Phillips (ankle), and LB Nakobe Dean (hamstring).

New York is in desperate need of a franchise QB and could score a top-five draft pick this weekend. While a loss would likely help the Jets in the long run, they are not resting starters to close the 2026 campaign.

New York RB Breece Hall (knee) is questionable for Sunday’s matchup, and RB Isaiah Davis (concussion) and TE Mason Taylor (neck) are out. Undrafted rookie QB Brady Cook will have another audition with a start on Sunday.

Will the Bills Rest Starters?

Despite Buffalo QB Josh Allen not practicing on Wednesday and Thursday (foot), coach Sean McDermott said Friday afternoon that the Bills’ superstar signal-caller is “good to go” for Sunday

While the Patriots won the AFC East, Buffalo could still boost its seeding. For example, a win paired with the Texans and Chargers losing would lock up the fifth spot.

With Allen active, the Bills could play most starters. The injury report includes TE Dalton Kincaid (knee) and DE Joey Bosa (hamstring) being out, while DT DaQuan Jones (calf) and S Jordan Poyer (hamstring) are out.

Los Angeles Chargers (11-5) vs. Denver Broncos (13-3) — Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS

Spread: Broncos -13.5 | Over/Under: 39.5

Will the Chargers Rest Starters?

Los Angeles is in position for the sixth seed and would move to the fifth spot with a win and a Texans loss. That looks challenging with several key players resting, including QB Justin Herbert and RB Omarion Hampton.

Adding to the limited rotation, L.A. LT Jamaree Salyer (hamstring) and C Bradley Bozeman (concussion) are battling injuries. With QB Trey Lance leading the charge, the Bolts are major 13.5-point underdogs on the road.

Will the Broncos Rest Starters?

Denver has plenty to play for this week, as a win would clinch the No. 1 seed in the AFC. They could be fired up, hence the 13.5-point spread.

They even have a limited injury report, including DE John Franklin-Myers (hip) and LB Dre Greenlaw (hamstring). This one could get ugly, which may mean starters sit late in Sunday’s bout.

1 seed The 49ers surged to the NFC's top seed in 2023 when they finished 12-5 and won the NFC West division.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The last time the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks met in the regular season with the NFC West on the line, an epic battle came down to a single yard.

It was the last game of the 2019 season. Then-Niners linebacker Dre Greenlaw stopped Seahawks tight end Jacob Hollister short of the goal line as time expired, sending San Francisco to a 26-21 win and the NFC West division crown, the NFC's No. 1 seed, a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the postseason. The 49ers would then go on a postseason run, but lose in Super Bowl LIV against the Kansas City Chiefs.

Six years later, a lot has changed for the 49ers and Seahawks -- who square off again Saturday night at Levi's Stadium (8 p.m. ET, ABC/ESPN) -- but not the stakes.

The Seahawks (13-3) enter the game in first place of the NFC West and on a six-game winning streak. A win or tie would lock them in for top spot in the division and the conference. They have an NFL-best 14-2 road record since 2024 under coach Mike Macdonald.

The 49ers (12-4) are also on a six-game winning streak -- and a seventh would pull them even with the Seahawks in overall record. They'd claim the NFC West crown and No. 1 seed by virtue of a 2-0 record against Seattle.

Back in Week 1, the Niners went to Seattle and escaped with a win in the closing moments. Since then, these teams have taken decidedly different paths to the same destination.

Seattle has emerged as one of the league's most complete teams, led by the second-best scoring defense in the NFL. The Niners have been the opposite, carving a path to the postseason on the strength of a high-octane offense that ranks fifth in offensive points per game and first since Week 9.

Add it all up and the expectation on both sides is for another classic that could come down to the final seconds, if not the final yard.

""We stole one up there, but I think they're going to be ready for this one,"" 49ers right tackle Colton McKivitz said. ""It's going to come down to that last couple of plays.""

Seahawks| 49ers

Seattle Seahawks (13-3) at San Francisco 49ers (12-4)

Saturday, 8 p.m. ET| ABC/ESPN | SEA -1.5 (47.5 O/U)

Can Seattle's defense get to 49ers QB Brock Purdy?

It's tempting to ask whether Sam Darnold and Seattle's offense can finally play a clean game and kick their recent bad habit of slow starts, as they've failed to top nine points in the first half in six of their past seven games.

But the unstoppable-force-versus-immovable-object matchup on the other side of the ball is worth watching. No offense has been hotter of late than San Francisco's (it has scored 40-plus points in each of the past two games), and maybe only one defense -- Houston's -- has been better than Seattle's all season. Macdonald's unit is allowing the second-fewest points in the NFL at 17.3 per game.

Part of the formula has been relying on their dominant front four -- led by 2026 Pro Bowlers Leonard Williams and DeMarcus Lawrence -- to get to opposing quarterbacks without having to send an extra rusher, instead keeping one more defender in coverage. The Seahawks rank fifth in pressure rate (35.1%) and 27th in blitz rate (20.4%).

Their 44 sacks are eighth most in the NFL, though they've only recorded four over their past four games. That is partly due to how quickly Indianapolis Colts'Philip Rivers and Carolina Panthers'Bryce Young got rid of the ball.

Purdy, on the other hand, has averaged the second-longest time before a throw of any quarterback this season at 3.19 seconds. Williams, Lawrence & Co. will need to take advantage of the opportunities Purdy gives them to get home. If San Francisco has to start its backup left tackle, with 12-time Pro Bowler Trent Williams questionable with a hamstring injury, there should be a few.

Seattle's key players to watch

QB Sam Darnold

The Seahawks are hoping that Darnold can regain the form he showed over the first two months of the season, when he led the NFL in Total QBR (78.2) through 10 weeks. The past seven have been an adventure. Darnold ranks 27th in Total QBR (37.3) since Week 11, committing 10 turnovers in that span. Which is not to say the Seahawks have been winning entirely in spite of him. Two weeks ago, for instance, he played a leading role in their epic comeback against the Rams, coming up clutch in the fourth quarter and overtime. Last week, he made several big-time throws on third down to help Seattle pull away from Carolina.

Darnold has up to $2.5 million worth of contract incentives that he can reach in this game, including $500,000 apiece for throwing three more touchdown passes and 150 more passing yards.

DB Nick Emmanwori

The rookie second-round pick played all of four snaps in the season opener against San Francisco before suffering an ankle injury that sidelined him for the next three games. Since returning, he has developed into an almost-every-down playmaker, a versatile weapon and one of the leading candidates for Defensive Rookie of the Year.

Emmanwori lit up the scouting combine with a 4.38 40-yard dash and a 43-inch vertical jump at 6-3 and 220 pounds. That blend of size and athleticism allows him to play all over the field -- sometimes lining up on the line of scrimmage, or across from slot receivers. He's an X factor that Seattle's defense didn't have the first time it faced the 49ers.

Stat to know

Wide receiverJaxon Smith-Njigbais having a historic season for the Seahawks. His 1,709 receiving yards and 113 receptions are franchise single-season records. He is 91 yards shy of becoming the seventh player in NFL history to record 1,800 receiving yards in a season.

Smith-Njigba is a downfield threat, leading the NFL in receptions and yards (683) on passes 20-plus yards downfield this season. His 974 yards on passes thrown outside the numbers this season is 222 more than the next-closest player.

Injury concerns

The Seahawks could be down to their third-string left tackle, undrafted rookie Amari Kight. They ruled out starter Charles Cross and have listed Josh Jones as questionable. Jones has filled in capably for Cross the past two games, but he suffered knee and ankle injuries against Carolina that kept him from practicing Tuesday and Wednesday before he returned Thursday as a limited participant.

The Seahawks' defense will likely be without safety Coby Bryant, who's doubtful with a knee injury that also sidelined him last week. The good news there is that Ty Okada has been an unsung hero this season while making nine starts for Julian Love and one last week for Bryant.

Another piece of good news for the Seahawks: Wide receiver and kick returner Rashid Shaheed cleared concussion protocol this week after leaving last week's game against the Panthers.

Best thing I heard in the Seahawks' locker room this week:

""We know they're a good offense and we're a good defense. Saturday is going to speak for itself. I'm not going to lip-box y'all to death about what we're going to do or not. I'm just going to get out there ... and play Saturday. Let us go, let our defense roll and let our pads do the talking Saturday night."" -- defensive tackle Jarran Reed

Last time the Seahawks won the NFC's No. 1 seed

It has happened three times in franchise history. Not coincidentally, those were the three times the Seahawks made the Super Bowl.

The most recent was in 2014, the year they came a yard away from claiming their second straight Lombardi Trophy. The Seahawks went 12-4 in the regular season before beating Carolina in the divisional round and then Green Bay in overtime in the NFC Championship Game, after they improbably erased a 12-point deficit in the final four minutes.

The Seahawks went into the final weekend of the 2019 season with a chance to claim the No. 1 seed with a win and some help. But by the time they kicked off against the 49ers, it was no longer in play for Seattle. So this will be the first time since 2014 in which the top seed will truly be on the line for the Seahawks in their regular-season finale. -- Henderson

Will San Francisco's defense step up and force turnovers?

Absent star defensive end Nick Bosa and linebacker Fred Warner, the Niners' defense has struggled mightily down the stretch, particularly when facing more efficient offenses. While Seattle's defense is the better side of the ball, the offense has been no slouch despite some late-season hiccups.

But the Seahawks also have a penchant for giving the ball away. Seattle has 28 turnovers this season, second most in the NFL with Darnold responsible for a league-high 20 of those.

Those giveaways have become even more common in the past seven games, as Darnold has 10 turnovers in that span. It's why a hot start that had Darnold -- who spent the 2023 season with the 49ers as Purdy's backup -- in the MVP conversation has given way to observers wondering if he can do enough to guide an otherwise well-rounded team on a deep playoff run.

The Niners' defense, meanwhile, has made its living this season off limiting explosive plays, forcing field goal attempts and coming up with the occasional fourth-down stop or red zone turnover.

Aside from that, though, there hasn't been a whole lot of resistance from Robert Saleh's patchwork unit. And taking the ball away is probably second only to pass rush in areas the Niners would like to improve defensively.

San Francisco is tied for 22nd in takeaways this season with 16 and has had none in seven of its 16 games. Coincidentally, it was a late-game forced fumble from Bosa that clinched San Francisco's Week 1 win against Seattle.

There will be no Bosa to bail the Niners out this time. The numbers suggest Seattle will give someone else a chance to make that key play that could win the game, but it's still fair to wonder who on the Niners' defense will be the one to capitalize when that opportunity arises.

49ers' key players to watch

QB Brock Purdy

There's a case to be made that Purdy is playing the best ball of his still young career. Since returning from a toe injury in Week 11, Purdy has thrown 16 touchdowns with five interceptions and added three rushing scores. He's not qualified because of time missed, but if he was, Purdy's 77.8 QBR would lead the NFL.

Like Darnold, Purdy has had turnover troubles, and Seattle's defense is a difficult challenge. But if he can take care of the ball, there should be opportunities for another big day.

CB Deommodore Lenoir

Lenoir has not shied away from trash-talking anyone but that's especially true when it comes to the Seahawks. Lenoir has fully embraced this rivalry and even fired shots at Smith-Njigba, Seattle's star wideout, in March. He doubled down on that this week, asking to shadow JSN on Saturday night.

""Man-to-man coverage, me and him,"" Lenoir said. ""That's what I want."" The Niners are unlikely to grant that request because of how they'd have to change their defense elsewhere but, after sharing his thoughts, Lenoir will be in the crosshairs if and when Seattle targets him.

Stat to know

Running back Christian McCaffreyhas shown what makes him a dual threat in the passing and rushing games again this season. His 17 total touchdowns are tied for third most by a Niner in a season. He is on pace to average 50 rushing yards per game and 50 receiving YPG in a season for the third time in his career.

McCaffrey's 116.4 career scrimmage YPG is the third most in NFL history (min. 100 games) after Hall of Famers Jim Brown (125.5) and Barry Sanders (118.9).

Against the Seahawks he can further cement himself in history. He needs five receptions to pass LaDainian Tomlinson (624) for the third-most catches by a running back in NFL history.And he needs four receptions to reach 100 for the season and become the first Niner since Terrell Owens in 2002 to hit the century mark.

Injury concerns

The Niners could be without left tackle Trent Williams because of a right hamstring injury. He's listed as questionable, and though coach Kyle Shanahan said Williams has made ""good progress,"" Williams said ""we'll see"" when asked if he will be available. Austen Pleasants, who fared well against Chicago last week, would make his first NFL start if Williams can't play.

As for George Kittle, who sat out last week against the Chicago Bears with an ankle injury, he said he ""absolutely"" expects to play versus the Seahawks, but was officially listed as questionable.

Best thing I heard in the 49ers' locker room this week:

""We never really thought that 'Hey, man, we've got to go attack the No. 1 seed.' It was always we've got to go take on whoever we're playing on Sunday and win that game. And so, this is just where we're at at the end of the year. We're very grateful for that, to be in this opportunity and situation. But, we can talk all we want. We have to go do it at the end of the day."" -- Purdy

Last time the 49ers won the NFC's No. 1 seed

The 49ers surged to the NFC's top seed in 2023 when they finished 12-5 and won the NFC West division. Including that year, each of the previous two times the Niners had the No. 1 seed under Shanahan they've advanced to the Super Bowl. -- Wagoner

Seahawks-49ers Injury Report: Shaheed to play; Cross ruled out

Horton, a fifth-round draft pick out of Colorado State, had 13 catches for 161 yards and five touchdowns in eight games. The speedy wideout also had 16 punt returns for 238 yards, including a franchise-record 95-yard punt return touchdown.

Horton got injured in a Week 9 win over the Washington Commanders on Nov. 2 and was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 22.

“It just takes a long time to heal,” Macdonald said. “And so put it this way, we’re planning on not having him. If something happens, which we’re not counting on, and he’s able to come back, then that’s great. But right now we’re planning on not having him. It just needs time and rest.

“It’s unfortunate, but these things happen. So we’re with him. He’s doing a great job. We’re just not gonna have him right now.”

Two days after Horton got hurt, the Seahawks acquired speedy wide receiver/returner Rashid Shaheed in a Nov. 4 trade-deadline deal with the New Orleans Saints.

Shaheed has since taken over Horton’s role as Seattle’s No. 3 receiver, hauling in 14 catches for 186 yards over his eight games with the Seahawks. He also had a 100-yard kick return touchdown and a 58-yard punt return score since arriving in Seattle.

Smith has been dealing with an ankle injury over the past few weeks and has missed a handful of games. He’ll have played in 12 games this season, the fewest in his five-year career.

Smith, who was named to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year, entered the season having just signed a four-year, $94 million contract extension that made him the NFL’s highest-paid guard.

Mike Caliendo has gotten the starting assignments in Smith’s absence and likely would get the call Sunday at the Las Vegas Raiders.

Four others are listed as questionable: tackle Jaylon Moore, running back Isiah Pacheco and defensive linemen George Karlaftis and Jerry Tillery. They were limited participants in practice on Friday.

Smith joins, among others, quarterback Patrick Mahomes, wide receivers Rashee Rice and Tyquan Thornton, cornerbacks Trent McDuffie and Jaylen Watson, tackles Josh Simmons and Jawaan Taylor and linebacker Leo Chenal — all of whom are on injured reserve — in finishing the season less than fully healthy.

Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said wide receiver Xavier Worthy is questionable for Sunday’s game.

“He’s sick, so we’ll have to see,” Reid said.

Who does that leave available for Sunday’s game, KC’s first season finale without playoff implications under Reid’s leadership?

Chu Godrick and Esa Pole, with a combined seven games of NFL experience, were the starting tackles against the Denver Broncos on Christmas. Rookie wide receiver Jaylen Royals made his first start in that game, too.

And rookie cornerback Nohl Williams and running back/return specialist Brashard Smith have been getting more snaps.

“Every chance some of these young guys have to play, benefits the team (and) benefits them being a part of the team,” Reid said. “I’d tell you that the last few games. If there’s a plus that you can take out of it, then that’d be it.”

McCarthy will start the team's final game of the season Sunday against the Green Bay Packers, coach Kevin O'Connell said Friday, after he recovered sufficiently from a hairline fracture in his right hand.

McCarthy missed the Vikings' Christmas Day game against the Detroit Lions, but he performed well in a throwing session Tuesday with medical officials and then participated in most of Wednesday's practice. He was a full participant both Thursday and Friday and will give the Vikings one last look at him before they enter the offseason.

""He threw the ball well,"" coach Kevin O'Connell said. ""So we're excited to see him play Sunday. It's going to be his 10th start. He has gained some experience and gets an opportunity to lead the team on Sunday, which is important.""

McCarthy has missed seven games in his first season as the Vikings starter because of three injuries -- a high right ankle sprain, a concussion and the fractured hand. After one of the worst six-game starts to a career for an NFL quarterback in the past decade, McCarthy has performed better in his previous three. His 69.8 QBR during that period ranked No. 9 in the NFL.

But just before halftime in Week 16 against the New York Giants, McCarthy dropped the ball as he attempted to throw a screen pass. The Giants' Tyler Nubin recovered the ball and returned it 27 yards for a touchdown. When he reached the sideline, McCarthy told the team's medical staff that he couldn't grip the ball.

The Vikings removed him from the game, which they won 16-13, and further testing revealed what O'Connell called a ""very, very small"" hairline fracture. McCarthy wasn't able to pinpoint when the injury occurred, saying earlier this week that it ""was just a multitude of things"" that occurred over the course of the season.

McCarthy had previously suffered what the Vikings called a bruised hand in Week 10. The injury caused him to be a limited participant in one practice but did not force him from any games.

A review of the game film showed that McCarthy hit his hand on the helmet of Giants defensive lineman Roy Robertson-Harris after a throw with 2 minutes, 57 seconds remaining in the second quarter. McCarthy managed to throw a short completion on the next play, and then he scrambled 12 yards for a touchdown after that.

He opened the Vikings' next possession by handing off to tailback Aaron Jones, but on second down he dropped the ball as he tried to throw the screen pass.",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1215%2Fr1589478_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 12:59:11.668335

With the Bulldogs trailing by 14 and under three minutes to play, Taylor was scrambling for extra yardage and his leg was hit awkwardly as he was tackled.

It appeared gruesome at the time. He writhed in obvious pain as play stopped, and teammates gathered around him. A few moments later, a cart came on the field to take Taylor, who is viewed as the team's promising young future quarterback, to the locker room.

""Initial reports have been good, so we'll continue to evaluate and get more information,"" Lebby said.

Lebby wouldn't say immediately after the game what part of the body Taylor injured, or if he suffered broken bones or torn ligaments.

""I feel good about getting in the locker room, being able to talk, talk to our medical staff, and being able to see Kamario again,"" Lebby added. ""We'll continue to evaluate.""

Taylor's mother, LaQuandra Conner, posted a picture of her and her son on Facebook after the game. Conner wrote that the injury was to Taylor's ankle and that ""nothing is torn or broken.""

Taylor was making his second career start for the Bulldogs (5-8) after a promising initial appearance in a loss to No. 6 Ole Miss.

He finished 13-of-22 for 241 yards and a touchdown against Wake Forest. He also ran for 63 yards and another score. After taking a snap from the shotgun, he ran forward, dove over several players and extended the ball over the goal line.

""A ton of toughness, and there's a ton of things to be excited about,"" Lebby said about Taylor.

Lebby added: ""For what he was able to get out of this bowl experience with 15 extra practices, the ability to go play in another game against a really good opponent, to me, that is huge for us as we're continuing to build this thing.""

Interim coach Mike McCoy ruled out five players with injuries in the season finale for the Titans (3-13) against the Jacksonville Jaguars (12-4) at EverBank Stadium on Jan. 4 (noon CT, FOX), interim coach Mike McCoy ruled out five players with injuries: cornerback Jalyn Armour-Davis, outside linebacker Arden Key, receiver Van Jefferson, tight end Gunnar Helm and edge rusher Oluwafemi Oladejo. McCoy also listed safety Amani Hooker as doubtful to play.

The Armour-Davis and Jefferson listings aren't surprising; both players exited the Week 17 loss against New Orleans with severe injuries, Armour-Davis to his Achilles and Jefferson to his arm. Helm, the rookie tight end who's caught 44 passes and two touchdowns in his debut season, has been battling a toe injury since Week 15. Key, who is dealing with a hip injury, is a pending free agent after three seasons with the Titans. And Oladejo has been on injured reserve since Week 6 and, despite returning to practice the last three weeks, will not be activated for the end of the season.

If Hooker is unable to go, the Titans' depth issues in the defensive backfield become even more dire. Already missing L'Jarius Sneed, Armour-Davis, Xavier Woods, Kevin Winston Jr., and Mike Brown to injury, not to mention the trades that sent Roger McCreary and Jarvis Brownlee Jr., elsewhere, the only healthy player in the Titans' secondary who's been with the team continuously since training camp is cornerback Darrell Baker Jr. Expect in-season acquisitions like safeties Jerrick Reed II, Sanoussi Kane and Erick Hallett II and cornerbacks Kaiir Elam and Micah Robinson to play bigger roles. Practice squad player Kemon Hall has been elevated to the active roster in recent weeks to help with the depth issues.

Without Helm, the only tight ends on the Titans' active roster are Chig Okonkwo and David Martin-Robinson. The other options would include practice squad tight end Cole Turner, as well as extra blocking help from utility linemen like Oli Udoh and Corey Levin.

The Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win and still have an outside chance of earning the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a win and losses by New England and Denver.

The Titans have spoiled the Jaguars' postseason hopes in Week 18 before, most recently in 2023 with a win in Nashville that doubled as the final Titans performances for running back Derrick Henry, quarterback Ryan Tannehill and coach Mike Vrabel.","https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/28/PNAS/87935752007-titans-v-saints-012.jpg?crop=3999,2250,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-03 14:59:47.198990

Panthers vs. Buccaneers Injury Report for Week 18

The NFC South title is on the line as the Carolina Panthers travel to Tampa to face the Buccaneers in a true win‑or‑go‑home matchup in Week 18.

The Bucs are 2.5-point favorites (1.75x payout) on the spread on PrizePicks Team Picks, with a 1.61x payout to win outright. Meanwhile, the road underdog Panthers carry a 2.22x payout to win outright on Team Picks.

The Panthers vs. Buccaneers over/under is set at 44.5 points, with a 2x payout on the over on PrizePicks.

All payouts listed are at the time of writing and are subject to change.

Carolina Panthers Injury Report for Saturday

OUT: CB Robert Rochell (concussion), LB Claudin Cherelus (calf/ankle)

QUESTIONABLE: LB Krys Barnes (back), DT Tershawn Wharton (hamstring), G Robert Hunt (biceps), WR David Moore (elbow)

Carolina's defense faces a significant challenge with key contributors sidelined for Saturday's must-win against Tampa Bay. Losing LB Claudin Cherelus (418 snaps) puts more pressure on a defense that has been league‑average, allowing 326.6 YPG (15th in the NFL).

Cherelus’ absence looms large for a Panthers run defense that allows 122.3 rushing YPG (19th‑most) and surrendered a season‑high 163 rushing yards to Seattle in Week 17.

It’s going to be a tough ask for the Panthers’ defense to stop the Bucs’ RB Bucky Irving, who turned in 71 yards on 19 carries against Carolina in Week 16, one of his most productive outings of the season.

Irving is projected for 58.5 rushing yards and 17.5 receiving yards in Week 18, projections courtesy of PrizePicks.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers Injury Report for Saturday

OUT: CB Jamel Dean (shoulder), LB Anthony Nelson (knee)

QUESTIONABLE: DT Calijah Kancey (pectoral)

Tampa Bay’s secondary faces significant challenges in Week 18 with veteran CB Jamel Dean (668 snaps) sidelined due to a shoulder injury. Dean, who recorded a league-best 26.6 passer rating when targeted this season, leaves a massive void in coverage alongside his 3 INT and 2 forced fumbles.

With Dean out and CB Zyon McCollum on injured reserve, the Buccaneers' pass defense — already ranked 26th in the NFL, allowing 236.4 passing YPG — becomes even more vulnerable.

Panthers QB Bryce Young has shown improvement in recent weeks, posting a 102.5 passer rating in his last matchup against Tampa Bay with 191 passing yards and 2 TDs.

Young's completion percentage sits at 63.2% with 2,745 passing yards and 21 TDs. The Panthers QB struggles under pressure, but faces a Bucs pass rush that averages just 2.3 sacks per game.

Young is projected for 195.5 passing yards and 0.5 passing TDs in Week 18; projections courtesy of PrizePicks.

{{nfl_offer_banner=""/style-system/ui-components-playbook""}}

Seahawks vs. 49ers Injury Report for Week 18

The biggest matchup on the Saturday slate takes place in Santa Clara, Calif., as the Seahawks visit the 49ers with a chance to clinch the NFC West and secure the NFC’s No. 1 seed for the first time since 2014. San Francisco enters on a six‑game winning streak.

The Seahawks are 2.5-point road favorites (1.88x payout) on the spread on PrizePicks Team Picks, with a 1.66x payout to win outright. Meanwhile, the road underdog 49ers carry a 2.12x payout to win outright on Team Picks.

The Seahawks vs. Seahawks over/under is set at 46.5 points, with a 1.72x payout on the over on PrizePicks.

All payouts listed are at the time of writing and are subject to change.

Seattle Seahawks Injury Report for Saturday

OUT: OT Charles Cross (hamstring)

DOUBTFUL: S Coby Bryant (knee)

QUESTIONABLE: OT Josh Jones (ankle/knee)

The Seahawks will be without starting LT Charles Cross, a significant loss for the NFL’s eighth‑ranked offense (350.8 YPG). Seattle’s offensive line has been one of the best in the league, allowing only 1.6 sacks per game, sixth‑fewest in the league.

With the loss of Cross and potentially backup LT Josh Jones, QB Sam Darnold may see added pressure from the 49ers’ front-seven. When blitzed, Darnold’s completion rate drops to 61.4% (22nd in the NFL), and his 65.5% catchable‑ball rate ranks 28th among QBs.

Luckily, the Seahawks get one of the softest pass-rushing matchups in Week 18; the Niners rank 29th in pass-rush win rate (30%) and 32nd in sacks, with just 1.1 per game.

Darnold is projected for 237.5 passing yards and 1.5 passing TDs; projections courtesy of PrizePicks.

San Francisco 49ers Injury Report for Saturday

QUESTIONABLE: WR Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle), TE George Kittle (ankle), OT Trent Williams (hamstring), DE Keion White (groin), CB Upton Stout (concussion)

San Francisco's offensive line faces a significant test against Seattle in Week 18. While All-Pro LT Trent Williams is a ""long shot"" to play due to his Week 17 hamstring injury, backup LT Austen Pleasants proved capable when pressed into duty against Chicago, helping the 49ers post 496 total yards.

The loss of Williams, who anchors a line allowing just 1.5 sacks per game (fifth‑fewest), creates a potential mismatch up front against a Seattle defense that generates 2.8 sacks per game (eighth‑most), ranks sixth in pass-rush win-rate (41%), and third in run-stop win rate, per ESPN.

49ers TE George Kittle's expected return vs. the Seahawks after missing Week 17 with an ankle sprain provides crucial relief for QB Brock Purdy. However, the 49ers’ fourth‑ranked passing attack (252.3 YPG) likely must operate without its premier blind‑side protector in the biggest game of the season.

Purdy is projected for 243.5 passing yards and 1.5 passing TDs; projections courtesy of PrizePicks.

Most of the postseason field is set as far as the teams are concerned, but divisions and seeding are up for grabs across the 16 games on Saturday and Sunday. Week 18 can be a tricky one for bettors due to varying motivation factors and whatnot, and injuries also play a big role. Here's a look at the most notable NFL injuries of Week 18 as well as a quick snapshot of which teams are expected to rest key starters. We'll also look at NFL betting lines per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.

Panthers at Buccaneers (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)

No major injuries of note

The Panthers can win their first NFC South title since 2015 with a win over the Buccaneers on Saturday, while Tampa Bay needs a win and a loss by the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday to win the franchise's fifth division title in a row. The good news is, both teams enter the final week of the season in pretty good shape health-wise.

Tampa Bay is a 3-point favorite. The total is 43.5.

Seahawks at 49ers (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)

SEA OT Charles Cross (hamstring, out)

SF OT Trent Williams (hamstring, questionable)

SF TE George Kittle (ankle, questionable)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee and ankle, questionable)

The winner of this matchup will take home both the NFC West and secure the No. 1 seed in the conference. The 49ers won this matchup back in Week 1 by a final score of 17-13 in Seattle. Both teams enter Week 18 on six-game win streaks. The Seahawks will again be without starting left tackle Charles Cross, this time against a tough San Francisco defensive front. The 49ers' main injuries are on offense, with George Kittle, Trent Williams and Ricky Pearsall all questionable to suit up in this pivotal matchup.

Seattle is favored by 2.5 points on the road. The total is 47.5.

Packers at Vikings (1 p.m. ET)

GB QB Malik Willis (shoulder and hamstring, questionable)

GB WR Dontayvion Wicks (concussion, doubtful)

MIN TE T.J. Hockenson (shoulder, out)

MIN RB Aaron Jones (hip, out)

The Packers are locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC, so expect to see many key contributors on the sideline for Green Bay against a Vikings team that is hoping J.J. McCarthy's solid end to the season can be a building block for 2026. McCarthy is back after missing last week with yet another injury, but he won't have his top running back in Aaron Jones or tight end T.J. Hockenson.

With the Packers set to rest many key starters, Minnesota is favored by 9.5. The total is 37.5.

Cowboys at Giants (1 p.m. ET)

DAL RB Javonte Williams (shoulder and neck, out)

DAL RB Malik Davis (calf and eye, out)

NY TE Theo Johnson (illness, out)

NY WR Wan'Dale Robinson (rib, out)

Both offenses are shorthanded here with both of Dallas top running backs out, including 1,000-yard rusher Javonte Williams, while two of New York's top receiving options are out for Week 18.

Dallas enters Week 18 favored by 3.5. The total is 49.5.

Colts at Texans (1 p.m. ET)

IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, out)

The Texans are hoping to get a win and some help in order to win the AFC South this weekend, and they're in good shape on the injury front. Injuries have played a part in the Colts' epic collapse after they started 2025 as one of the best teams in the NFL. They'll again be without top cornerback Sauce Gardner, and the team will turn to rookie Riley Leonard in Week 18, ending Philip Rivers' shocking NFL return at three weeks.

The Texans are 10-point favorites. The total is 38.5.

Browns at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)

CLE TE Harold Fannin Jr. (groin, out)

CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)

Two teams that struggle in very different ways meet in Week 18. The Browns' scuffling offense is down two top playmakers in tight ends Harold Fannin Jr. and David Njoku, meaning two fewer weapons for Shedeur Sanders against a Bengals defense that's horrific at defending tight ends.

Cincinnati is a 7.5-point favorite while the total sits at 44.5.

Saints at Falcons (1 p.m. ET)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)

NO WR Chris Olave (blood clot, out)

ATL WR Drake London (knee, questionable)

ATL TE Kyle Pitts (knee, questionable)

Top playmakers for both offenses are out or questionable here, as the Saints are down top receiver Chris Olave due to a blood clot scare while running back Alvin Kamara remains out with multiple injuries. Two of Atlanta's top pass catchers are questionable here in Drake London and Kyle Pitts. If the Bucs win Saturday, they need the Falcons to lose in order to win the NFC South.

Atlanta is favored by 3.5, and the total is 43.5.

Titans at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

The Jaguars have plenty to play for this week, as a win clinches them the AFC South, while a win and some help could net them the No. 1 seed in the conference. The good news for Jacksonville is the team is in good shape health-wise against a Titans team that's just trying to get across the finish line and find its next head coach.

The Jaguars are 13.5-point favorites here, and the total is 47.5.

Cardinals at Rams (4:25 p.m. ET)

ARI WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (foot, injured reserve)

LA WR Davante Adams (hamstring, questionable)

LA RB Kyren Williams (ankle, questionable)

LA RB Blake Corum (ankle, questionable)

The Cardinals are just looking to finish what's been a dreadful 2025 campaign, while the Rams are licking their wounds after consecutive close losses that cost them the NFC West and a shot at the No. 1 seed. Arizona is down Marvin Harrison Jr. for this season finale, while Davante Adams, Kyren Williams and Blake Corum are all questionable to suit up for L.A.

Los Angeles is favored by 8.5. The total is 46.5.

Commanders at Eagles (4:25 p.m. ET)

WASH QB Marcus Mariota (hand and quad, out)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, out)

PHI DT Jalen Carter (shoulders, out)

PHI TE Dallas Goedert (knee)

The Eagles are expected to take things easy in Week 18 by resting key players ahead of the postseason, a strategy that worked well last year ahead of a Super Bowl run. Tanner McKee is expected to start at quarterback for Philly. The Commanders, meanwhile, are down to their third quarterback as Marcus Mariota, who has been starting in place of the injured Jayden Daniels, is out for Week 18, setting up a start for journeyman Josh Johnson.

The Eagles are favored by 4.5, and the total is 38.5.

Chargers at Broncos (4:25 p.m. ET)

LA RB Omarion Hampton (ankle, out)

LA RB Kimani Vidal (neck, questionable)

The Chargers will rest many key players in Week 18, including quarterback Justin Herbert, who had surgery on his left hand a few weeks ago. For this matchup with Denver, which can clinch the No. 1 seed in the AFC with a win, the Chargers will be without rookie running back Omarion Hampton, who has over 700 scrimmage yards in nine games this year. No. 2 back Kimani Vidal is questionable to suit up.

Denver is a massive 12.5-point favorite, and the total is 37.5.

Jets at Bills (4:25 p.m. ET)

NY RB Breece Hall (knee, questionable)

NY TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)

BUF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, questionable)

The Bills are just trying to improve their playoff seeding in Week 18, and they face a Jets team that has really struggled and will be without most of its top weapons on offense. Garrett Wilson has been out for some time, rookie tight end Mason Taylor is out once again and star running back Breece Hall is questionable. Tight end Dalton Kincaid is questionable for Buffalo due to a nagging knee injury.

Buffalo is a 7.5-point favorite. The total is 37.5.

Dolphins at Patriots (4:25 p.m. ET)

MIA RB De'Von Achane (shoulder, doubtful)

MIA WR Jaylen Waddle (ribs, questionable)

MIA TE Darren Waller (groin, injured reserve)

The Patriots can clinch the top seed in the AFC with a win and a Broncos loss on Sunday, and they will face a rather depleted Dolphins offense in Week 18. Star running back De'Von Achane is doubtful, while No. 1 receiver Jaylen Waddle is questionable. Tight end Darren Waller was also placed on injured reserve this week.

The Patriots are favored by 11.5, and the total sits at 45.5.

Lions at Bears (4:25 p.m. ET)

DET WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee and ankle, questionable)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, questionable)

The Lions have nothing to play for but pride in Week 18, while the Bears can secure the No. 7 seed in the NFC with a win. Detroit may be without star receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown, who has been hobbled by various ailments the last few weeks. Rome Odunze is aiming to return for the Bears after missing time with a nagging foot injury.

Chicago is a 3-point favorite. The total is the highest of the entire Week 18 slate at 50.5.

Chiefs at Raiders (4:25 p.m. ET)

KC RB Isiah Pacheco (rest, questionable)

KC WR Xavier Worthy (illness, doubtful)

LV QB Geno Smith (ankle, out)

The Raiders are playing for pride at this point as their 10-game losing streak has them in line for the No. 1 pick in April's NFL Draft. They will be down quarterback Geno Smith, who is out with an ankle injury. Both Kenny Pickett and Aidan O'Connell are expected to see the field. The Chiefs usually have nothing to play for in Week 18, but that's because they've often clinched a postseason berth and a high seed. Instead, the Chiefs are just playing things out in a lost season that sees third-string QB Chris Oladokun starts once again.

The Chiefs are 5.5-point favorites, and the total is 36.5.

Ravens at Steelers (8:20 p.m. ET)

BAL QB Lamar Jackson (back, will play)

PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, will play)

The AFC North will be decided in the final game of the 2025 regular season. The Ravens are 8-8 while the Steelers are 9-7, and the winner will secure the No. 4 seed in the AFC. Both teams will get their best player back for Week 18 as Lamar Jackson returns from a back injury that cost him last week while T.J. Watt returns to the Steelers' defense after he suffered a collapsed lung during a dry needling session.

Baltimore is a 3.5-point road favorite. The total is 41.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/11/24/1dc240e9-9ef6-4a62-82af-d960abbcd68b/thumbnail/1200x675/24fb2a7bf5a2226f5b7a974faacf5562/george-kittle-san-francisco-49ers-imagn-images.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 14:59:53.283802

This will mark the ninth game he has missed this season.

Greenlaw previously missed the first six games of the campaign with a quad injury, one game with a suspension and last week's game with his current hamstring injury. The 28-year-old linebacker has totaled 43 tackles, two pass breakups, one interception, one forced fumble and one sack in eight appearances this season.

Greenlaw is expected to be ready for the playoffs, according to the Denver Post's Luca Evans. With Greenlaw sidelined this week, Justin Strnad is set to make his eighth start of the season in Week 18. Strnad will be joined by Alex Singleton at inside linebacker.

The Broncos are going to be thin at linebacker, as they also ruled out Karene Reid (hamstring). They are likely saving Reid for the playoff run.

Denver may also be down defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers (hip), who was listed as questionable.

Josh Jones latest Coaches have liked how veteran swing tackle Josh Jones has played the last two games starting for Cross.
“It’s questionable if he’s going to play...Injury report is what it is.","Tory Horton’s season is apparently over.

Good — no, great — thing for the Seahawks their general manager traded for Rashid Shaheed.

Coach Mike Macdonald said Friday following practice before his 13-3 team boarded its plane to the NFC West title game at the San Francisco 49ers (12-4) Saturday night (5 p.m., ABC and ESPN, KOMO channel 4 locally) the Seahawks don’t expect Horton to play in Seattle’s upcoming postseason.

The team’s speedy wide receiver, kick returner and fifth-round draft choice this spring hasn’t played since he got his most snaps all season and caught two touchdown passes from Sam Darnold Nov. 2, in Seattle’s blowout of the Commanders in Landover, Maryland. Horton emerged in that game veteran wide receiver Cooper Kupp missed with an injury.

Horton has been on injured reserve the last two months with a shin issue. It isn’t getting better anytime soon, his coach said Friday.

Macdonald said the team doesn’t expect Horton, who had a team-record 95-yard punt return for a touchdown to spark a runaway first half to beat New Orleans Sept. 21, to play again until next season.

“What he has, it just takes a long time to heal,” Macdonald said. “We’re planning on not having him.

“And if something happens — which we’re not counting on — and he’s able to come back, then that’s great. But right now we’re planning on not having him. He just needs time and rest.

“It’s unfortunate.” This is the second consecutive year Horton’s had a season-ending injury. A knee injury in October 2024 ended his college career at Colorado State. It’s why he fell to the fifth round in the draft.

General manager John Schneider decided to send New Orleans two third-day draft picks to acquire Shaheed the first week of November. That was the week Horton’s shin condition appeared, during a practice days after the Commanders game. Macdonald said at the time Horton’s injury was a carryover from that Washington game.

Shaheed arrived in Seattle and immediately became a game- and field-changing force in kickoff and punt returns. His speed deep on pass routes also has changed how opponents defend NFL receiving yards leader Jaxon Smith-Njigba.

The Seahawks would not have rallied from 16 points down to the Rams with 10 minutes left to force overtime and eventually win Dec. 18 if Shaheed hadn’t returned a punt for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.

Last weekend Shaheed got concussed by Carolina’s Mike Jackson throwing him down hard into the turf beyond the sideline following an 8-yard catch and run.

A team doctor then an independent doctor cleared Horton this week out of the NFL’s concussion protocol.

Shaheed will play Saturday night at San Francisco.

“To my understanding, it was a good exam (by an independent neurologist) right there at the (Carolina) game,” Macdonald said. “I know he’s confident at where he’s at and feels great, had a good week.

“Yeah, I think he’s in a good spot.”

Shaheed will be a weapon on special teams and in Darnold’s passing game Saturday night that the Seahawks did not have in their loss to San Francisco 17-13 at Lumen Field back in week one, Sept. 7.

Charles Cross for playoffs

Charles Cross will miss his third consecutive game Saturday night with the hamstring injury he got on Jason Myers’ game-winning field goal to end Seattle’s win over Indianapolis Dec. 14.

Macdonald said the Seahawks are expecting Cross to start in their first playoff game.

If Seattle beats San Francisco, the Seahawks will have a first-round bye and begin the playoffs in the divisional round the weekend of Jan. 17-18. If Seattle loses Saturday it will play next weekend in the wild-card round at the NFC South champion, either Carolina or Tampa Bay.

“We’re optimistic for next week, or the week after (if they don’t play until then), for Charles,” Macdonald said. The coach said special-team mainstay Chazz Surratt (ankle), running back George Holani (hamstring) and rookie tight end Elijah Arroyo (knee) also have chances to return off IR for the Seahawks’ playoff games.

Josh Jones latest

Coaches have liked how veteran swing tackle Josh Jones has played the last two games starting for Cross.

Jones is questionable to play Saturday night. The team lists him with knee and ankle issues. But he practiced for the first time this week on Thursday. It’s trending toward Jones starting at San Francisco, though Macdonald was purposefully coy avoiding declaring that Friday.

“He’s doing good. He’s progressing,” Macdonald said with a grin. “Yeah, yeah.

“It’s questionable if he’s going to play...Injury report is what it is. We will stick with it right now.”

Cowboys player to watch

QB Dak Prescott has a 14-game winning streak against the Giants since two of his losses in a 13-3 rookie season in 2016 came against them. It's the second-longest winning streak against a single opponent in NFL history behind Bob Griese, who beat Buffalo 17 consecutive times from 1968-79. Prescott will get credit for a Dallas victory because he is expected to start. The question is how long he will play in a finale with no playoff implications. Either way, this will go down as one of Prescott's best seasons. He enters the final week first in the NFL with 4,482 yards passing.

Giants player to watch

WR Wan'Dale Robinson gets to put the finishing touches on his case for a new contract, either with the team that drafted him or elsewhere. Robinson last week became the first player 5-foot-8 or shorter to eclipse 1,000 yards receiving since 5-7 Richard Johnson in 1989 and just the third since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. And he's playing against a Dallas secondary without Trevon Diggs, who was released on Tuesday.

Key matchup

Cowboys' offensive line vs. Giants' pass rush. New York's Brian Burns trails only Cleveland record-chasing Myles Garrett in sacks with a career-high 16 1/2, while rookie Abdul Carter has heated up with 3 1/2 over the past four games. Dallas would like to keep Prescott upright, no matter how long he plays.

Key injuries

Cowboys: RBs Javonte Williams (stinger) and Malik Davis (calf/eye) have been ruled out. The backs with a chance to be active have 54 career carries among them: FB Hunter Luepke (32) and rookies Jaydon Blue (22) and Phil Mafah (0). Mafah has been out all season with a shoulder injury, and is listed as questionable ... LB DeMarvion Overshown and rookie CB Shavon Revel have been dealing with concussions and won't play.

Giants: Two starters in the secondary are out: CB Cor'Dale Flott (knee) and S Jevon Holland (knee/concussion).

Series notes

The Cowboys have won nine in a row against the Giants and 16 of the past 17. It's the longest active series in the league. Dallas' last winning streak this long was against Carolina from 1998-2012. ... Each team has been eliminated from playoff contention. ... The Cowboys are trying to avoid consecutive losing seasons for the first time since going 5-11 under coach Dave Campo from 2000-02. ... New York can still secure the top draft pick with a loss and Las Vegas victory against Kansas City or could drop as low as No. 7. ... This is expected to be interim coach Mike Kafka's final game with the Giants.

Stats and stuff

Cowboys WR George Pickens needs 80 yards receiving to reach 1,500 in his Dallas debut after the offseason trade from Pittsburgh. His only 1,000-yard season in three years with the Steelers came in 2023, when he had 1,140. ... Ferguson needs one touchdown catch to tie the franchise tight end record of nine, held by Jason Witten and Billy Joe Dupree. ... In their Week 2 game, K Brandon Aubrey had a tying 64-yard field goal on the final play of regulation and a winning 46-yarder as time expired in overtime in the 40-37 Dallas victory. ... Giants rookie QB Jaxson Dart has accounted for 22 TDs (13 passing and nine rushing) with just five interceptions, in his first 11 professional starts. ... Robinson led the team with 113 yards receiving at Las Vegas. He had 142 in Week 2 at Dallas, which was before top receiver Malik Nabers was knocked out for the season with a torn ACL in his right knee. ... LB Bobby Okereke intercepted Geno Smith and had seven tackles last week. ... CB Deonte Banks returned a kickoff 95 yards for a TD against the Raiders.

Fantasy tip

Daily fantasy players might be able to cash in if Giants RB Tyrone Tracy has another big game rushing and receiving.

Seattle listed Jones (knee/ankle) as a nonparticipant Tuesday and Wednesday, then limited Thursday, when game designations came out.","RENTON, Wash. -- The Seattle Seahawks are expecting some reinforcements to return for the playoffs, but Tory Horton isn't likely to be one of them.

Coach Mike Macdonald said Friday that Seattle isn't counting on the standout rookie wide receiver to return from the shin injury that has sidelined him since midseason. The team had been holding out hope that Horton, who scored six touchdowns in his first eight NFL games, could return at some point this season.

""We got some clarification on Tory,"" Macdonald said. ""The best way I could describe it is what he has, it just takes a long time to heal. So put it this way: We're planning on not having him. If something happens -- which we're not counting on -- and he's able to come back, then that's great. But right now we're not planning on having him. He just needs time and rest. It's unfortunate, but these things happen. We're with him. He's doing a great job. We're just not going to have him right now.""

Macdonald said there's no long-term concern about Horton's shin injury and that Horton should have a full offseason.

A fifth-round pick out of Colorado State, Horton beat out veteran Marquez Valdes-Scantling for Seattle's No. 3 receiver job out of training camp. He caught five touchdown passes and scored another touchdown on a 95-yard punt return, which broke the record for longest in club history.

But Horton began dealing with his shin injury in early November, landed on injured reserve and hasn't played since.

Macdonald said the Seahawks are optimistic that left tackle Charles Cross will return in the next two weeks. Cross missed the past two games with a hamstring injury and was ruled out for the Seahawks' regular-season finale against the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday night, which will determine the NFC West champion and the conference's No. 1 seed.

The Seahawks might be down to their No. 3 left tackle against San Francisco -- undrafted rookie Amari Kight -- as backup Josh Jones is listed as questionable. Seattle listed Jones (knee/ankle) as a nonparticipant Tuesday and Wednesday, then limited Thursday, when game designations came out.

On Friday, Macdonald said Jones is progressing, but he otherwise said little about Jones' chances of playing beyond reiterating that he's questionable.

The Seahawks also listed starting safety Coby Bryant (knee) as doubtful.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0103%2Fr1595999_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 03:58:07.397317

Mariota, who is dealing with a cut on his throwing hand and a quad injury, was considered doubtful to play in Week 18, Quinn said earlier in the week, and has not practiced since sustaining his injuries. Josh Johnson is set to make his second start to close out the Commanders' season.

""If he can accelerate and stop and start and do those things, that would be a difference,"" Quinn said of Mariota on Wednesday. ""He's not able to do that today.""

Johnson made his first start since the 2021 season on Christmas Day and completed 65% of his passes for 198 yards with no turnovers. It was the second highest completion percentage of his career as a starter and his fourth most yards in a single game. Quinn said on Monday that the Commanders would ""lean and start with Josh again"" if Mariota could not play because of Johnson's performance and decision-making that helped the offense have one of its better performances since the bye week and keep the game competitive.

""Josh did a lot of things correct that I liked, so we would lean in that way again for sure,"" Quinn said.

Tunsil has dealt with an oblique injury that held him out of Washington's Week 17 game last Thursday. While Tunsil has no issues moving forward, Quinn said, he has had issues with ""turning and torquing."" Like Mariota, Tunsil has not practiced all week and was considered a ""long shot"" to play on Sunday.

""Everything with your oblique is all about the rotation and the power that comes from that,"" Quinn said.

Second-year pro Brandon Coleman is currently in line to start in Tunsil's place at left tackle -- a position he held as a rookie in 2024. Coleman had one of his best weeks as a pass-blocker against the Cowboys, according to Pro Football Focus, allowing just one pressure on 28 pass block snaps.

""I think...he has learned a lot here in year two,"" Quinn said. ""This is a resilient guy that can do a lot of things based on his athleticism, him learning and going through the hard moments.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/commanders/q1k04p2kunhkgjhi1r8h,N,,2026-01-03 09:58:48.221230

Honestly, I don't know if I could say that a week ago, but I feel really good,"" Watt said. ""I feel really confident about the week of practice, and I'm excited to play.""

Watt hasn't played since Pittsburgh's last meeting with Baltimore, a 27-22 win on Dec. 7, due to a lung injury suffered as a result of an accident that occurred while he was receiving dry needling treatment at the team's facility.

Watt underwent surgery to repair the partially collapsed lung on Dec. 10, causing plenty of concern for Watt's condition in the immediate aftermath of the accident. Nearly a month later, it sounds as if Watt avoided the worst and has recovered well enough to consider playing again.

""I got dry needling at the facility. Didn't feel right shortly afterwards. I was in a significant amount of pain,"" Watt recounted. ""Ended up going to the hospital and getting surgery. Recovery was different because it was something I wasn't used to, but I'm very thankful for everybody here, very thankful for Dr. (Ryan M.) Levy at UPMC for taking good care of me and helping guide this whole process back. It's been very unique, but I feel really good sitting here today.""

Because Pittsburgh lost to the Cleveland Browns in Week 17 and Baltimore defeated the Green Bay Packers, the Ravens can win the AFC North title and send the Steelers home for the winter with a win on Sunday night in the Steel City. Pittsburgh can do the same to Baltimore with a home victory and will need Watt's involvement in order to maximize the Steelers' chances of success.

Watt won't go for another round of dry needling ahead of this contest, smiling before telling reporters, ""I am gonna take a break now, for sure."" The Steelers will hope he can earn them a few with his performance Sunday.

Before the injury, Lane Johnson started 10 games and was performing at a very high level.
The Eagles are resting most of their starters in Week 18 so the injury report this week isn’t too much of a concern.","For the first time since suffering a Lisfranc sprain in his foot on Nov. 16 against the Lions, Eagles All-Pro right tackle Lane Johnson made an appearance at practice on Friday.

While Johnson did not participate, he was out there in his No. 65 jersey and had a helmet too during the brief portion of practice open to reporters. As the rest of his teammates warmed up in the middle of the indoor practice field, Johnson was against the back wall stretching.

Johnson’s presence on Friday appears to be a positive sign for his availability in the Eagles’ wild-card game next weekend at the Linc.

Johnson, 35, has missed the last six games with that injury and backup Fred Johnson has made those starts. Before the injury, Lane Johnson started 10 games and was performing at a very high level. In those 10 starts, Johnson hadn’t surrendered a sack and had been charged with just 7 pressure, per PFF.

Johnson was one of six Eagles' players ruled out for Week 18:

OUT: DT Jalen Carter (hip), LB Nakobe Dean (hamstring), S Marcus Epps (concussion), TE Dallas Goedert (knee), T Lane Johnson (foot), OLB Jaelan Phillips (ankle)

Williams hasn't played since the Patriots' Week 11 win over the New York Jets due to an ankle injury. He was the team's major free agent addition last offseason and had been playing at a high level prior to the injury. The Patriots' run defense has really struggled without him.

Marlin Klein, a 6-foot-6, 250-pound tight end, has declared for the 2026 NFL Draft according to ESPN on Friday, Jan. 2.

Klein, a captain in 2025, who battled his way through injuries off and on this season, still had one year of NCAA eligibility remaining.

Klein had the best year of his modest career in 2025, hauling in 24 receptions for 248 yards and one touchdown in 11 games, starting strong and fading out. Klein set the tone for what felt like it could be a monster season in Week 1, finishing with a career-high six catches for 93 yards and the first touchdown catch of his career from quarterback Bryce Underwood.

Instead, the rest of the way he had just 18 grabs for 153 yards and didn't find the end zone. Klein missed the Week 2 loss at Oklahoma after sustaining a lower body injury during practice and also missed the 24-7 win over Washington at home in mid-October with another undisclosed injury.

Klein played the rest of the games, but had to leave U-M's bowl game against Texas early after taking what appeared to be a helmet-to-helmet hit on a short checkdown throw near the left sideline. He had four catches for 39 yards in the 41-27 loss to the Longhorns.

Klein was a raw prospect, coming from Cologne, Germany, yet he grew under both tight ends coaches Grant Newsome and, more recently, Steve Casula. He was voted a captain by his teammates and an All-Big Ten honorable mention by both coaches and media.

Klein appeared in 35 games in his career with 12 starts but told ESPN he's ""ready for the next step.""

“The NFL is getting an explosive player that can do whatever is asked of him - play special teams, run block and catch the ball and someone who is not going to complain about his usage,"" Klein said according to ESPN. ""They are getting a player that’s willing to die for his teammates.”

Michigan's tight end room now primarily features Hogan Hansen, Deakon Tonielli, Zack Marshall and Brady Prieskorn − if they all stick around for 2026 − as well as incoming freshman Mason Bonner.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/29/PDTF/87526993007-112925-um-1-h-037.jpg?crop=2717,1528,x0,y0&width=2717&height=1528&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-02 22:58:06.581716

The Panthers have some issues to contend with defensively, especially if Wharton is out in addition to Cherelus. Hunt's potential absence would hurt the running game as well.

Dean's absence could affect Tampa's efforts to cover Tetairoa McMillan. Kancey could be on the verge of a return from his pectoral injury after upgrading to a full practice on Thursday.

Cross' absence will affect the protection in front of Sam Darnold, while Bryant potentially missing the game would affect the coverage on the back end of the defense.

George Kittle seems on the verge of a return for San Francisco. Pearsall played last week despite his injuries. White is one of San Francisco's top pass rushers in the wake of all the injuries the Niners have been dealing with and his potential absence could be a blow on that front.

Neither Jordan Love nor Josh Jacobs has an injury status for Green Bay, but Love is not expected to play. We don't yet know whether Willis will start in his place but if he does, he'll be without a top offensive lineman and one of his key receivers.

J.J. McCarthy is off the injury report for the Vikings but don't have his starting tight end or running back here.

The Giants are down a pair of starters in the secondary, as well as two of Jaxon Dart's top options in the passing game.

The Bills took Josh Allen off the injury report, but we don't yet know if he'll actually play. They will be down three key defenders and could be without two more players up front. Kincaid missed last week and has been playing through injuries all year.

The Lions are eliminated from the playoffs, and their entire offensive line is banged up entering this game. They also may not have Amon-Ra St. Brown, who has been battling injuries in recent weeks.

The Bears are mostly healthy, though Odunze still seems unlikely to go considering he has just one limited practice under his belt. Trapilo's potential absence could be important at tackle.

The Cardinals are pretty healthy but Sweat's potential absence would obviously affect their pass rush.

The Rams have said that they'll play their healthy starters no matter what happens in the Seahawks-49ers game on Saturday, but here we see that they have listed a bunch of those players as questionable after getting in limited practices during the week, so they could just be inactive for the game depending on the result the night before.

Fitzpatrick's absence will be felt on the back end of the defense. Mike McDaniel said that players who don't practice are unlikely to play, so that applies to Achane. The Dolphins could also be without a pair of starting offensive lineman, their best linebacker, a pass rusher, their kicker and then their No. 1 wide receiver.

The Patriots are missing a few key defenders here but Milton Williams and Will Campbell are off the injury report after upgrading to full practices late in the week. Demario Douglas and Kayshon Boutte will be in action as well.

The Seahawks will play Saturday's game without starting left tackle Charles Cross, who has been ruled out, meaning he will miss a third straight game due to a hamstring injury.
""These guys have done a great job of getting back and working, but obviously Charles isn't going to make it this week.""
""My understanding, it was a good exam right there at the game,"" Macdonald said.
We're with him, he's doing a great job, we're just not going to have him right now.","The Seahawks fly to the Bay Area on Friday ahead of a big Week 18 showdown with the 49ers, which will decide both the NFC West title and the NFC's top seed.

And Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald liked what he saw from his team at practice as they prepared for a game on a short week.

""Guys did a great job,"" he said. ""We're ready to go… The guys did a great job. We were talking about the process and how we wanted to change the calendar a little bit, and the guys were just like, 'Look we'll do whatever, just let us know.' We did, and the guys executed it. I thought we had a great week.""

The Seahawks will play Saturday's game without starting left tackle Charles Cross, who has been ruled out, meaning he will miss a third straight game due to a hamstring injury.

The good news is that there is hope that Cross is back for the Seahawks' first playoff game, which will be in two weeks if they win and earn a bye, or next week if they end up a wild card team.

""We're optimistic for next week or the week after for Charles,"" Macdonald said. ""These guys have done a great job of getting back and working, but obviously Charles isn't going to make it this week.""

Josh Jones, who has started the past two games for Cross, is listed as questionable due to knee and ankle injuries. Jones, who played every offensive snap in last week's win in Carolina, did not practice Tuesday or Wednesday, then was listed as limited on Friday.

Asked directly if Jones would play, Macdonald, who earlier in the week indicated that Jones would be able to play, elected to stick with the injury report, saying, ""It's questionable if he's going to play. He's progressing; the injury report is what it is. We'll stick with it right now.""

If Bryant doesn't play, the most likely outcome with a doubtful designation, then Ty Okada would again start in his place. When it comes to depth, the Seahawks lost safety D'Anthony Bell this week when he was claimed off waivers by the Panthers, so one option could be veteran Quandre Diggs, who signed to the practice squad in November, but has been dealing with a thigh injury (players on the practice squad aren't listed on the injury report).

Asked if Diggs could play this weekend, Macdonald said, ""He could. He's coming back from his injury as well, so we're working through that.""

Receiver Rashid Shaheed, who left last week's game with a concussion, did not have a game status designation, meaning he is ready to play.

""My understanding, it was a good exam right there at the game,"" Macdonald said. ""So I know he's confident on where he's at, feels great, and he's had a good week. I think he's in a good spot.""

Macdonald also provided more clarity on rookie receiver Tory Horton, who has been on injured reserve with a shin injury since November. Unfortunately, Horton is unlikely to play again this year.

""We got some clarification on Tory,"" Macdonald said. ""The best way I can describe it is that what he has, it just takes a long time to heal. Put it this way, we're planning on not having him, and if something happens, which we're not counting on, and he's able to come back, then that's great. But right now, we're planning on not having him. He just needs time and rest. It's unfortunate, but these things happen. We're with him, he's doing a great job, we're just not going to have him right now.

""He should be able to have a full offseason. Who knows how things are going to shake out, how long we go and all that, but right now we're not planning on having him. But not a long-term concern.""

Aside from Horton and receiver Cody White, who was placed on injured reserve this week due to a groin injury, the other players put on IR this season—running back George Holani, tight end Eljah Arroyo and linebacker Chazz Surratt—all have a chance to return in the playoffs.

""Really all those guys with the exception of Tory and Cody I would say at some point would be capable of coming back,"" Macdonald said.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/rah72bsbzcc5hsf0tuoj,N,,2026-01-02 18:58:24.418359

Receiver Dontayvion Wicks (concussion) is doubtful after not practicing this week. The Packers also ruled out receiver Savion Williams (foot/illness), guards Donovan Jennings (throat) and John Williams (back/physically unable to perform), and linebacker Nick Niemann (pectoral/injured reserve).

Quarterback Jordan Love (left shoulder/concussion) did not receive a game status and will be available Sunday, though Head Coach Matt LaFleur told reporters earlier this week the intention is for Love not to play in Minnesota.

With Green Bay locked into the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs, the Packers announced on Thursday that third-string quarterback Clayton Tune will start against the Vikings but have not disclosed who'll serve as his backup.

If Willis isn't available, former Atlanta third-round pick Desmond Ridder could be a possibility after he signed to Green Bay's practice squad on Wednesday.

""He's a guy that we've seen up close and personal,"" said LaFleur of Ridder. ""We played against him when he was in Atlanta and watching what he did in that game, he led them to a win. He's got experience in the system. He's put in the time. … He'll be ready to go if need be.""

Tom, who was limited in practice this week, has been out since injuring his knee against Denver on Dec. 14. Former first-round pick Jordan Morgan started the past two games in Tom's place.

Savion Williams practiced in a limited capacity Wednesday but didn't participate the past two days. The Packers planned for Williams to play against the Ravens before falling ill before the game. Sunday will be the fifth game the rookie third-round pick has missed this season.

""We'd love to get him back,"" said LaFleur of Williams on Thursday. ""He's been pretty hobbled for multiple weeks, and to compound that, last week he was really sick, so there was a lot of factors into that.""

In addition to Love, Green Bay didn't issue a game status for the following players who will be available: running back Josh Jacobs (knee/ankle), guard Aaron Banks (illness/ankle), linebacker Edgerrin Cooper (shoulder), receiver Jayden Reed (illness), defensive lineman Lukas Van Ness (illness/foot).

The Packers listed Jacobs as a full participant on Friday, marking the first time he's practiced in full since a Friday practice in Week 14.

Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy (right hand) isn't carrying a game status and will play Sunday after missing last week's game against Detroit.

While the Bears are getting healthier, the Lions were forced to shut down four of their starters for this game.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

Ruled OUT

RT Penei Sewell (ankle)

IOL Trystan Colon (wrist)

DT Alim McNeill (abdomen)

LB Alex Anzalone (concussion)

SAF Thomas Harper (concussion)

Sewell was unable to practice this week, and coach Dan Campbell hinted at his Friday morning press conference that the All-Pro right tackle might not be available for the season finale:

“I don’t feel great about Sewell right now, but I’m always going to hold out hope. But as far as does it affect you not having him? Yeah, it does. I mean he’s a phenomenal player. He’s a phenomenal football player. Yet, we’ve got guys who are going to step in and do a good job for us. They’ve got a job to do, they’ll have a role and we expect them to hold up their end of the bargain.”

The Lions will most likely turn to veteran Dan Skipper to start at right tackle against the Bears, with reserve Kayode Awosika available in an emergency third offensive tackle role. Giovanni Manu remains a long shot to play in Week 18.

Colon has been dealing with a wrist injury for several weeks now, and while he looked like he was making positive progress in recent games, he was unable to practice this week and will not play in Week 18.

McNeill’s injury popped up ahead of Week 17, then he appeared to reaggravate his abdomen during the game, left early, and hasn’t practiced since. With him ruled out, look for first-round pick Tyleik Williams to see an increased role and quite likely get the start.

Anzalone and Harper were not able to clear the NFL’s concussion protocol, and both have been ruled out. With Anzalone in a contract year, it’s fair to speculate if he has played his last game as a Lion. Harper remains under contract next season.

Questionable

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee/ankle)

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness/rest)

OT Giovanni Manu (knee) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 5

LG Christian Mahogany (illness)

OL Kayode Awosika (illness)

St. Brown wants to play in Week 18, and according to Campbell, things are “trending the right way.” Campbell did leave the door open to possibly holding the start wide receiver out of the finale, but for now, he looks on track to finish out the season in Chicago.

Decker saw two limited practices this week—which is more than most weeks—and appears to be heading towards another start at left tackle.

Manu progressed through his injury evaluation window, and while he could be an option to replace Sewell, Campbell told the media on Friday that it’s unlikely that they activate him for this game, reiterating that his return to practice was more about getting him ready for 2026:

“I don’t see playing him this last one,” Campbell told the media, later adding, “You get football reps, and so those have been good for him. I mean, he looks a lot better than he did three weeks ago when he started, so that’s a good thing. He gets some individual work, some technique work, team work against our defense. So, that always helps.”

Mahogany and Awosika look as if they’ve put their illness behind them and are on track to play against the Bears.

No injury designation

DB Avonte Maddox (back/illness)

Maddox looks to be in a good position to return to game action this week and is expected to step back into a starting role.

S Minkah Fitzpatrick (calf)

New England’s rookie left guard will remain in the NFL’s concussion protocol for a second Sunday in a row. And across the ball, three March signings will stay sidelined until the playoffs. The all-purpose Tonga has not practiced since sustaining a foot injury against the Baltimore Ravens. Knee and ankle injuries have also kept defensive captains shelved off the edges and off the ball.

Landry leads team with 8.5 sacks, 19 quarterback hits and 10 tackles for loss. As for Spillane, who played his most recent snaps as the calendar turned to December, he leads the way with 97 tackles while also having a hand in one sack, one forced fumble and two interceptions.

Westover was sidelined for the Patriots on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day due to an ankle injury that arose in the fourth quarter last weekend. The fullback moves forward as questionable, along with a member of the cornerback depth chart, after practicing in a limited capacity on Friday.

But additional calls loom without game designations. When asked whether offensive tackle Will Campbell or defensive tackle Milton Williams will be activated in time for the finale, New England’s head coach provided optimism.

“We’ll see how they respond to today’s work. Try to get them a full week of work in,” Vrabel said of the full participants. “But I think it looks good. Both were able to work the whole week, and we’ll see where they’re at tomorrow.”

Both have resided on injured reserve with respective knee and ankle injuries since November, yet have seen their 21-day windows open in consecutive weeks, along with cornerback Alex Austin.

Some teams are opting to use Week 18 as a tune-up before the playoffs begin, while others are making bold moves to keep their starters in. Here is a rundown of notable roster situations to watch in Week 18.

Expected to play starters

Los Angeles Rams

After a “humbling” 27-24 loss to the Atlanta Falcons on “Monday Night Football,” Rams head coach Sean McVay did not hesitate to declare his starters active for Week 18 against the Arizona Cardinals.

“We need to play,” McVay said. “We need to play better football.”

The Rams have lost their last two games and eliminated themselves from the NFC West and No. 1 seed race. Instead, Los Angeles is between the No. 5 or 6 seed. Quarterback Matthew Stafford might also want to use this week to redeem his MVP case after one of his most inconsistent showings against the Falcons. It’s worth noting a win by the Seattle Seahawks over the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday night would lock the Rams into the No. 5 seed — and a wild-card matchup with the NFC South champions — and perhaps change McVay’s approach.

Statuses to watch

Buffalo Bills

Coach Sean McDermott said quarterback Josh Allen will practice on Friday and “be good to go” against the New York Jets on Sunday. The quarterback missed some practice time earlier this week with a foot injury, bringing up speculation about how the team would handle his status — and the status of the other starters — against a lowly 3-13 Jets team. Buffalo is already locked into a wild-card spot in the AFC and could land anywhere between the No. 5 and 7 seeds.

There are two caveats here, though. First, Allen has a 139-game starting streak, across the regular season and playoffs, that is the longest active streak for a quarterback. Last season, he played one snap in Week 18 to preserve it.

Second, this is likely the final game at the Bills’ old Highmark Stadium.

Resting QB/key starters

Los Angeles Chargers

Quarterback Justin Herbert will not dress for his team’s Week 18 matchup with the Denver Broncos, coach Jim Harbaugh said earlier this week. Herbert fractured his left hand four weeks ago. He had surgery to stabilize the fracture and didn’t miss a start, but Harbaugh said “he’s got bruises that need to heal” before the Chargers’ playoff run.

Los Angeles could rest other starters against the Broncos, but Harbaugh did not specify who those players might be. The Chargers already clinched a playoff berth and are currently the No. 6 seed in the AFC. They could drop to No. 7 with a loss to the Broncos or move up to No. 5 with a win, plus some help elsewhere. Trey Lance will start at quarterback for the Chargers.

The game means much more for the AFC West champion Broncos, who would lock up the No. 1 seed and the first-round bye with a victory. Denver could fall as low as the No. 3 seed if it lost and the Jacksonville Jaguars and New England Patriots both won.

Philadelphia Eagles

Coach Nick Siranni said the “marathon of a season” is the reason he will be resting key starters against the Washington Commanders despite playoff seeding still on the line. Tanner McKee will start at quarterback in place of Jalen Hurts, and others will likely join Hurts on the sideline. This is the fourth time in five seasons in which the Eagles have rested key players in Week 18.

The Eagles, currently the NFC No. 3 seed, could rise to No. 2 if they beat the Commanders and the Chicago Bears lose to the Detroit Lions. If they remain the No. 3 seed, they would host either the Rams or the 49ers.

Green Bay Packers

Quarterback Jordan Love has cleared concussion protocol but will not start against the Minnesota Vikings. Love has not played since suffering his first documented NFL concussion in the second quarter of a Week 16 overtime loss to the Bears.

Third-string quarterback Clayton Tune will get Sunday’s start. The Packers’ backup options are limited in a banged-up quarterback room. Malik Willis is nursing a hamstring injury, and the team signed Desmond Ridder to the practice squad on Wednesday. The Packers are already locked into the NFC’s No. 7 seed and will travel to play either the Eagles or Bears in the wild-card round.

Indianapolis Colts

Philip Rivers’ three-game resurgence from retirement is officially done. Already eliminated from playoff contention, the Colts will start rookie Riley Leonard in their season finale against the Houston Texans.

The 44-year-old Rivers confirmed in an interview on the “Up & Adams Show” on Wednesday that his playing career is over (again) and he will return to coaching high school football next year in Fairhope, Ala., where two of his sons will be on the same team. Leonard was a sixth-round pick out of Notre Dame and has appeared in four games this year, mostly in garbage time during blowouts.

Las Vegas Raiders

The Raiders don’t have playoff implications at stake, but they will lock up the No. 1 pick if they lose to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. Coach Pete Carroll told reporters on Wednesday that he was getting quarterbacks Kenny Pickett and Aidan O’Connell ready to go, while starter Geno Smith is likely not to play with an ankle injury. Carroll said Pickett, who has been the primary backup this season while O’Connell spent time on the IR, will likely start, but he expects both quarterbacks to play.

Star pass rusher Maxx Crosby will also not play after the Raiders placed him on injured reserve last week due to a lingering knee injury. The decision caused tension between the team and Crosby, who told reporters three days before his IR designation, “I don’t give a s— about the (first) pick, to be honest.” Tight end Brock Bowers was also placed on IR last week with a knee injury that’s bothered him all season.

If the Raiders beat the Chiefs, who are down to their third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun, they could still end up with the No. 1 pick if the New York Giants lose to the Dallas Cowboys. They also could still end up with the top pick even if the Cowboys win so long as at least three of these teams win this weekend: Seahawks (at 49ers), Cleveland Browns (at Cincinnati Bengals), Falcons (vs. New Orleans Saints) or Bears (vs. Lions). Among those teams, the Seahawks, Falcons and Bears are all favored, according to BetMGM.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/02132440/GettyImages-2253987452-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-02 16:59:41.184176

Star edge rusher T.J. Watt, who returned to practice in a limited capacity this week, indicated Friday when speaking with reporters that he will play in Sunday's decisive clash against the Baltimore Ravens.
""I feel pretty good,"" Watt said.
""Honestly, I don't know if I could say that a week ago but I feel really good.
I feel really confident about the week of practice and excited to play.""","It appears as if the Pittsburgh Steelers will have one of their top players back on the field as they push for an AFC North title in Week 18. Star edge rusher T.J. Watt, who returned to practice in a limited capacity this week, indicated Friday when speaking with reporters that he will play in Sunday's decisive clash against the Baltimore Ravens.

Watt has been sidelined since Dec. 7 after undergoing surgery to correct a partially collapsed lung.

""I feel pretty good,"" Watt said. ""Honestly, I don't know if I could say that a week ago but I feel really good. I feel really confident about the week of practice and excited to play.""

Watt initially went to a Pittsburgh hospital last month when he experienced discomfort in his chest after a dry needle treatment session. The ensuing surgery caused him to miss three games.

Watt indicated that he plans on taking a break from dry needling for the time being.

""It was very scary,"" Watt said. ""Just a significant amount of pain. Obviously, anytime you go to work and then have to all of a sudden need surgery, it sucks. Just a lot of unknown. But I'm glad to have the doctors that we had, surgery that I had. To be able to be here and play in a football game this weekend is all I'm really focused on now.""

Prior to the setback, Watt, a four-time first-team All-Pro with the Steelers, had 53 total tackles, including 15.5 for a loss, and seven sacks. He also logged an interception and seven pass deflections.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/02/a0419c0c-b910-4fcd-81f8-9462e3cc4d21/thumbnail/1200x675/f2d8aa401b669ad2ab6bce98943065b4/gettyimages-2249563802-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 18:00:10.587453

​With possible returns from injured reserve on the horizon, DT Milton Williams (ankle) and LT Will Campbell (knee) are off the injury report.
This week, starting LT Will Campbell returned to practice for the first time since injuring his knee in a Week 12 win over the Bengals.
Depending on whether Campbell is activated for Sunday's game, the Patriots have two possible starting offensive line combinations.
Campbell and Williams playing in Sunday's regular-season finale will give them in-game reps before the intensity increases in the playoffs.","On Friday, New England ruled out OLB Harold Landry III (knee), LB Robert Spillane (ankle), LG Jared Wilson (concussion), and NT Khyiris Tonga for Week 18. The Patriots also listed FB Jack Westover (ankle) and CB Charles Woods (foot) as questionable for Sunday's game vs. the Dolphins. ​With possible returns from injured reserve on the horizon, DT Milton Williams (ankle) and LT Will Campbell (knee) are off the injury report.

Starting with a trio of Patriots currently on injured reserve, reinforcements should be arriving for New England just in time for the playoffs. This week, starting LT Will Campbell returned to practice for the first time since injuring his knee in a Week 12 win over the Bengals. Campbell was injured when he was hit on the side of his knee while pulling in space in front of a run play. As for Williams, the standout defensive tackle returned to practice last week, but wasn't active in Week 17. Lastly, CB Alex Austin (wrist) is also eligible to return from injured reserve.

​Campbell, the fourth-overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, started the first 12 games of his NFL career at left tackle. He was having a strong rookie campaign, ranking second among rookie tackles in pressure rate allowed (5.4%). At the time of the injury, the hope was that the 21-year-old would be able to return for the postseason and after being a full participant in practice this week, it appears that Campbell is on track to return for at least the postseason. ​

Although he'll be welcomed back with open arms, backup LT Vederian Lowe filled in well for Campbell over the last four games. In four starts filling in for Campbell, Lowe only allowed one sack, showing he is capable of spot-starting in place of the talented rookie. New England also has some uncertainty at left guard with third-round rookie Jared Wilson remaining in concussion protocol. Last week, super-sub Ben Brown made his third start at left guard for Wilson, but had some ups and downs, allowing three total pressures.

Depending on whether Campbell is activated for Sunday's game, the Patriots have two possible starting offensive line combinations. The first option would be LT Campbell, LG Brown, C Bradbury, RG Onwenu, and RT Moses. The other would be another week of Lowe in for Campbell at left tackle, with New England having until 4 p.m. ET on Saturday to decide on Austin, Campbell, and Williams.​

As for Williams, the standout defensive tackle has participated in the last four practices in a limited capacity, as he works his way back from a high-ankle sprain suffered in Week 11. Williams told reporters this week that he has more ""confidence"" in his ankle to possibly give it a go on Sunday, while adding that he'd like to knock some of the rust off before the playoffs. On Friday, head coach Mike Vrabel had a positive update on Campbell and Williams.

""We'll see how they respond from today's work. Tried to get them a full week of work in, but I think it looks good. Both of them were able to work the whole week and we'll see where we're at tomorrow,"" Vrabel said.

Campbell and Williams playing in Sunday's regular-season finale will give them in-game reps before the intensity increases in the playoffs. However, three key defenders remain out for the Patriots: Landry, Spillane, and Tonga. With the Pats missing four key pieces in their front seven, including Williams, their run defense has slumped to 19th in rush EPA allowed, while New England now ranks 20th in pass-rush win rate. The run defense, in particular, is missing its starting MIKE linebacker (Spillane), best block-shedder (Williams), and run-stuffing nose tackle (Tonga).

Although he won't play this week, Spillane returned to practice on Friday for the first time in three weeks, a positive step toward a potential return in the playoffs. Spillane was last active in the Patriots loss to the Bills but didn't play and hasn't played or been at practice since Week 15. Spillane also appeared on WEEI radio and gave a positive update on his status for the playoffs.

""I'm very motivated. Every day I come here eager to get back on the field, preparing. I think we're moving in the right direction. I'm looking forward to getting back on the field,"" Spillane said.

As for the Dolphins, star RB De'Von Achane (shoulder) is doubtful and starting S Minkah Fitzpatrick (calf) won't play on Sunday for Miami. Achane leads the league in yards per carry (5.7) and explosive runs (40), anchoring the eighth-ranked rushing attack in EPA. The Dolphins are mathematically eliminated from postseason contention, so with nothing to play for on Sunday, Achane could sit – a significant loss. Rookie RB Ollie Gordon II and Jaylen Wright will likely get the bulk of the carries for Miami if Achane doesn't play.

Although the Patriots are headed to the playoffs as AFC East champs, the AFC playoff seeding is still undecided heading into Week 18. With a win, New England secures a top-two seed, while it could finish with the No. 1 overall seed in the conference with a win and a Broncos loss. If the Patriots lose, they could fall to the No. 3 seed if the Jaguars beat the Titans in Jacksonville. With a chance at the No. 1 overall seed and the No. 2 seed to preserve, Vrabel said all healthy players will play vs. the Dolphins on Sunday. As mentioned, the Patriots have until 4 p.m. ET on Saturday to activate Austin, Campbell, and Williams from injured reserve – we'll keep you updated. ​",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/dsgb7xsutjsrwtmcn1wk,N,,2026-01-02 16:59:45.511494

Rookie left tackle Will Campbell, the No. 4 pick in April’s draft, seems poised to return to game action after missing four games with a right knee injury.

“It looks good,” coach Mike Vrabel said regarding the odds Campbell will be protecting quarterback Drake Maye’s blindside in Sunday’s regular-season finale against the Miami Dolphins. Campbell will have to be activated from injured reserve to play in Sunday’s game.

The addition is a massive one for the Patriots with the postseason looming. While Vederian Lowe played fine in relief of Campbell, the Patriots needed Campbell back before the start of the playoffs. Now, Campbell will have one game against the Dolphins to prep for playoff action.

“I’m looking forward to having Big Willy back out there and looking forward to seeing him get back to doing what he does best,” Maye said earlier this week.

Allen aggravated his foot injury during the Bills' Week 17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles and didn't practice on Wednesday and Thursday, casting doubt over whether he'd play in Buffalo's regular-season finale.

However, Allen has started 121 straight games -- 134 in a row, if you include playoffs. There's also the added factor of saying goodbye to ""The Ralph,"" otherwise known as Highmark Stadium, as Sunday will mark the Bills' final home game there, barring some postseason upsets. Buffalo (11-5) is currently seeded seventh in the AFC playoff bracket and can jump up to No. 6 or No. 5 depending on how Week 18 goes.

Allen was injured and missed four games during his 2018 rookie campaign and has started every game since Week 12, 2018.

The Panthers would clinch their first division crown since 2015 with a win, while the Buccaneers need a victory on Saturday plus an Atlanta loss to New Orleans on Sunday to be the South champs for a fifth season in a row. To find out how to watch, listen and livestream the game, click here.

As Pro Football Talk writes, it's ""now or never for the Bucs to snap out of it."" One analyst considers the return of Tristan Wirfs to be a very important factor in the outcome, and CBS Sports' Pete Prisco thinks the Buccaneers' offense will get back on track. One expert considers the Panthers a somewhat easier team to trust at the moment, and another notes Carolina's alternating pattern of wins and losses over the last 10 weeks would suggest a win on Saturday. While one analyst pointed out that the Bucs' averaged just 5.6 yards per pass attempt against the Panthers in Week 16, another provides the counterargument that Carolina's Bryce Young only threw four passes more than seven yards downfield last week, completing just one.

The Buccaneers are 2.5-point favorites at home but the experts are finding it difficult to trust either team and thus there isn't much of a consensus. Here's what some of them are predicting will occur on Saturday afternoon at Raymond James Stadium:

NFL.com – Four of five analysts go with the Bucs, but none predict a margin of more than four points

ESPN.com – Eight of the 11 assembled experts have their picks in, and six go with the home team

CBSSports.com – Pete Prisco sides with the Bucs in a six-point decision

USA Today – Only one of six prognosticators likes the Buccaneers in this one

Bleacher Report – Using the spread, four of seven analysts go with Carolina

""Over the last couple months, the Panthers' previously potent run game has ground to a halt, while their once-stout run defense has become a sieve. The Bucs have their own issues, to be sure, but they also have the more experienced quarterback and coach in this matchup, as well as the more established roster. This isn't truly a postseason play-in game -- while Carolina would clinch the division with a win, Tampa needs a win on Saturday and an Atlanta loss to New Orleans on Sunday -- but it will feel like one in the moment. And with this game taking place in Raymond James Stadium, I'm all too willing to go down with the pirate ship.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/buccaneers/pjcbqcaspqsnrqpywrvr,N,,2026-01-02 16:59:48.693308

No wonder he was happy.

After practicing fully each of the last two days, the Seahawks’ Pro Bowl kick and punt returner plus wide receiver is full go to play Saturday when Seattle (13-3) goes for the NFC West title and the conference’s top playoff seed at the San Francisco 49ers (12-4) in Santa Clara, California.

Shaheed was not on the official injury report the Seahawks issued Thursday for the game. That indicates a team plus an independent doctor both cleared him through all five phases of the NFL’s concussion protocol. Shaheed got concussed last Sunday when Carolina cornerback Mike Jackson threw him into and well beyond the sideline boundary into the Panthers’ bench area following Shaheed 8-yard catch and run. Seattle won the game 27-10.

He was the reason the Seahawks rallied from 16 points down in the fourth quarter to beat the Los Angeles Rams 38-37 in overtime Dec. 18. Shaheed touchdown on a punt return began Seattle’s comeback.

The Seahawks’ other positive injury development Thursday was veteran swing tackle Josh Jones practiced and is questionable to play Saturday. Jones injured his ankle and knee in the Carolina game, his second consecutive start for injured Charles Cross.

Coaches have praised Jones for his play replacing Cross as the blind-side protector for right-handed quarterback Sam Darnold.

“That’s why we signed him (in March),” offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak said Thursday

Cross is officially out for the 49ers game. He injured his hamstring on Jason Myers’ game-winning field goal on the final play of Seattle’s win over Indianapolis Dec. 14.

The Seahawks signed undrafted rookie offensive tackle Amari Kight from the practice squad to the active roster this week as insurance in case Jones can’t play at San Francisco. But Thursday’s developments signal Jones likely will play.

The Seahawks have a light practice at team headquarters Friday before they fly to the Bay Area Friday afternoon.

Starting safety Coby Bryant is listed as doubtful for the game Saturday. He missed the Carolina game last weekend with a knee injury he got during the Seahawks’ win over the Los Angeles Rams Dec. 18. Ty Okada is poised to start again for Bryant. Okada has started 10 games this season, nine for previously injured Julian Love.

The Vikings and Packers have met 130 times in their history, with Green Bay possessing a 67-60-3 advantage in the series.
Sunday will be just the fourth time in franchise history the Vikings have won at least four consecutive games going into the final week of the regular season.
The previous three instances happened in 1969 (12 consecutive victories), 1998 (seven consecutive) and last season (nine consecutive).","Although Minnesota and Green Bay have faced each other twice a year during the regular season since the Vikings inception in 1961 (except for the strike-shortened 1982 season), the two teams have rarely closed the regular season together. Sunday's game will mark only the seventh time in the Border Battle's history the Vikings and Packers will play each other in the regular-season finale. Naturally, both teams have split the previous six such meetings, which are detailed below:

The Packers won't be taking any chances with so many banged-up offensive players, including Jordan Love, Josh Jacobs, Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs and some linemen. They also will try their best to rest some defenders ahead of the Wild Card round. The Vikings can now smell finishing above .500 to salvage a rough season of QB transition for Kevin O'Connell. Regardless of the QB they throw in, the Vikings will finish well to make Justin Jefferson and others feel much better for 2026.

Packers Head Coach Matt LaFleur announced Thursday that, despite Jordan Love clearing concussion protocol, Clayton Tune will get the start Sunday. He was thrust into action last week, and it didn't exactly go well, but this will be his second career start – his first was in 2023 with the Cardinals. Injuries have caused the Packers to spiral, losing three straight, so getting healthy is likely the main priority before heading on the road for the first round of the playoffs. Minnesota is trending in the opposite direction at the moment, winning its past four games thanks to the dominant play of Brian Flores' defense, which allowed 12.3 points per game in that span. Might we see more of the same with Tune under center for Green Bay? Probably. Offensively, it's still been a struggle for the Vikings. J.J. McCarthy has a chance to start despite dealing with a hairline fracture in his hand. Honestly, at this point, I don't care who the Vikings trot out at quarterback. What I do care about is Justin Jefferson getting 53 yards, which he needs to hit 1,000 receiving yards for the season. He would join Hall of Famer Randy Moss and Mike Evans as the only players with 1,000-plus receiving yards in each of their first six seasons. It'll be a shame if a healthy Jefferson doesn't accomplish that feat because of this season's nightmarish QB play.

I certainly don't feel comfortable favoring the Vikings by this many points in a divisional game – regardless of who is at quarterback. However, I think this game will mean a whole lot more to Minnesota than it does to the Packers, who are locked into the NFC's No. 7 seed. I'd expect Green Bay to sit multiple starters on both sides of the ball and to fall behind late as the Vikings try to end their season on a high note.

The Vikings and Packers have met 130 times in their history, with Green Bay possessing a 67-60-3 advantage in the series. Last year, Minnesota swept the Packers in the regular season for the first time since 2017; on Sunday, the Vikings will try to avoid being swept by Green Bay for the first time since 2019. The Packers claimed the most recent matchup at Lambeau Field in Week 12 with a 23-6 victory to snap Minnesota's two-game win streak against Green Bay.

After dropping four consecutive games in November, the Vikings have made a late-season charge, as Minnesota has won its past four contests. Sunday will be just the fourth time in franchise history the Vikings have won at least four consecutive games going into the final week of the regular season. The previous three instances happened in 1969 (12 consecutive victories), 1998 (seven consecutive) and last season (nine consecutive). The 1998 season is the only one in which Minnesota won the regular-season finale.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/hbxsjlph4lydrxs3rkd4,N,,2026-01-02 15:00:45.539564

Love has been cleared from concussion protocol but is being rested for the playoffs.

Coach Matt LaFleur is prioritizing injury avoidance as the team is locked into the NFC's seventh seed.

GREEN BAY – Jordan Love lay on the grass at Soldier Field, eyes closed until the Green Bay Packers staff arrived, ringing in his head.

He’d just taken a hit from Chicago Bears defensive end Austin Booker, and his head was throbbing. Love would get up and run to the locker room with the urgency of a player who wanted to return as quickly as possible.

“I didn’t know,” Love said. “I’m always trying to go out and hopefully meet with the doctors, see what’s going on and try to get back as quickly as possible. But I didn’t know at the time.”

The plan for Love finally became clear Jan. 1. Love’s sack, which was nullified because Booker led with his helmet against the quarterback’s head, with 8 minutes, 21 seconds left in the second quarter at Chicago on Dec. 20 will be his final regular-season snap this season.

The Packers will start quarterback Clayton Tune this week against the Minnesota Vikings, declining to use their Week 18 matchup as a tune-up for the postseason. With his team locked into the NFC’s seventh seed regardless of the result, coach Matt LaFleur is prioritizing rest and injury avoidance over finding a late-season rhythm.

Love would be available if the Packers still had a chance to win the NFC North this week. He's a full participant in practice and was cleared from concussion protocol on Jan. 1. Instead, LaFleur made clear “the intent is not to play him.” The Packers were eliminated from a division title in last week’s loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Love said he prepared the entire week like he would play against the Ravens. He felt no symptoms of his first NFL concussion but learned late in the week he failed the computerized testing necessary to clear the league’s concussion protocol.

“I understood what the situation was,” Love said. “I just didn’t clear the concussion protocol. It’s one of those things where you understand coming into it you might be going, you might not be going. It just came down to understanding that obviously the protocol is there in place to try to keep me safe, protect me. And even though you might be feeling good, there’s a lot more things that could happen potentially in a game to knock you out even further.

“So it’s just understanding that and understanding I’ll be good. It’ll be good to sit out a week, rest and come back under center.”

The potential problem, of course, is that Love will not be returning one week after missing the Ravens game. He will instead enter next week’s NFC wild-card playoff matchup at either Chicago or Philadelphia without having played in almost three full games. The Packers are structuring practice this week in an attempt to mitigate any rust from such a substantial absence.

LaFleur’s plan includes scripting practice periods to include starters on offense and defense taking reps against each other. Love said the only difference from a game is he won’t be hit in practice. He isn’t concerned about practice reps failing to adequately prepare for game speed in the postseason.

“I would even argue,” Love said, “sometimes in the game it feels like it slows down a little bit compared to practice. It’s something where I played all season. It’s not like I sat out all season and am just coming back. I have a lot of banked reps playing out there. I know what it’s like to be on the field and feel those things, and obviously vice versa in practice trying to emulate game speed and get everything back to feeling like you’re in that atmosphere.”

Love didn’t just start 15 games this season, staying healthy until his concussion. He started twice against the Bears and once against the Eagles, the Packers’ two potential opponents in the wild card. He’ll have familiarity with both defenses that stand in the Packers’ way of the divisional round.

He’s also using this week to get a head start on preparation. The Packers are likely to play the Bears, given the Eagles also are resting starters in their regular-season finale and currently hold the third seed. Love said he has “a good idea” of who his team will play next week, and he’s already started watching film.

Love is still in quarterbacks meetings this week and will help Tune prepare for his start, but it’s not the same attention on the Vikings that would be required if he were starting.

“Obviously, if I was starting this game, I would be preparing and having all my focus on this week,” Love said, “and this is a defense that you’ve got to have a lot of focus going into that week and just understanding the different looks. So, yeah, if you can get ahead and start looking at other teams, it definitely helps out.”","https://www.packersnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/21/PMJS/87868933007-packers-20-27.jpg?crop=4147,2333,x0,y114&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-02 16:59:56.696906

LaFleur said he “anticipates” Packers rookie defensive end Collin Oliver finally making his NFL debut in Week 18.

Oliver was drafted in the fifth round out of Oklahoma State, where he mostly lined up as an edge rusher and off-ball linebacker, totaling 134 tackles, 40.5 tackles for loss, and 23.5 sacks. Unfortunately, his senior season was limited to just two games due to a foot injury.

""He dealt with a little bit of an injury this year, didn't play a lot, but the one thing about him, especially back to the '23 tape, you turn the tape on him, and you can see he's got a twitch and explosiveness off the edge that brings a little bit more of a unique skillset that way,"" said Packers director of scouting Milt Hendrickson after the team took Oliver 159th overall. ""He's also got some versatility that's going to allow him to play some stack (linebacker), and then he brings incredible special teams value with his whole skillset.""

Oliver was expected to be a situational pass rusher and contributor on special teams, but a hamstring injury cost him all of training camp and the preseason.

The Packers placed Oliver on the physically unable to perform list to start the regular season and didn’t designate him for return until Dec. 2. After making it through multiple weeks of practice, Oliver was then activated to the 53-man roster on December 22.

The hope is that Oliver can add some juice to a Green Bay pass-rushing unit that will be without Micah Parsons for the rest of the season and hasn’t gotten a sack from Rashan Gary in nine straight games.

However, even if Oliver makes his rookie debut Sunday against the Vikings, the game will have no impact on the Packers' playoff positioning. Coming off three consecutive losses, they are already locked in as the NFC’s seventh seed. Green Bay is expected to rest several of its key players against Minnesota, including quarterback Jordan Love, who sustained a concussion against the Chicago Bears on Dec. 20 and only recently cleared the league's protocol. With backup Malik Willis dealing with a shoulder injury, LaFleur confirmed Thursday that third-string quarterback Clayton Tune will be the starter.

Still, Sunday's game could be an opportunity to get a good look at Oliver and newly acquired corner Trevon Diggs as the team tries to get back on track to make a deep run in the postseason.","https://packerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/23/SPAC/85340155007-usatsi-26073571.jpg?crop=5021,2825,x0,y264&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-02 13:59:35.978423

Stacy Rost: Defense wins championships? Seahawks are counting on it

Wide receiver and Pro Bowl return man Rashid Shaheed is set to play Saturday night, as he does not have an injury designation on Thursday’s report just four days after suffering a concussion in a win over the Carolina Panthers.

That’s big news for the 13-3 Seahawks, as it means they will continue to have a dynamic presence on special teams thanks to Shaheed, who has returned both a kickoff and a punt for a touchdown since coming to the Seahawks in a November trade with the New Orleans Saints.

Three Seahawks have injury designations for Saturday’s game:

• Starting left tackle Charles Cross will be out for the third straight week with a hamstring injury.

• Starting safety Coby Bryant is doubtful, putting him at risk of missing a second straight game with a knee injury.

• Tackle Josh Jones, who has started on the offensive line in Cross’ absence, is questionable with ankle/knee concerns.

Bryant and Jones were both limited in practice Thursday after not participating Wednesday, while Cross did not practice at all this week.

Shaheed was a full participant on both Wednesday and Thursday.

As for the 49ers, they have three notable offensive players questionable for Saturday: left tackle Trent Williams (hamstring), tight end George Kittle (ankle), and wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (knee/ankle). Cornerback Upton Stout (concussion) and defensive lineman Keion White (groin) have also been ruled questionable.

Kittle and Pearsall have been limited in practice this week, while Williams has not participated. Star Niners running back Christian McCaffrey did not participate in practice Tuesday, was limited Wednesday and practiced in full Thursday while dealing with a back issue.

The Seahawks and 49ers (12-4) will meet at 5 p.m. Saturday, with the winner taking the NFC West championship, the No. 1 seed in the NFC, and a bye through the wild card round of the playoffs. Radio coverage on Seattle Sports will begin at 2 p.m. Saturday with the pregame show.

We'll see how quickly he can find his way onto the field in Green Bay.","Trevon Diggs' surprise departure from Dallas landed him with an NFC contender in Green Bay.

It's a fresh start he may have needed to get back on track after an injury riddled last few years, and it returns Diggs to a place of importance -- even if he might not yet own a vital role with his new squad. Because of injuries at the position, Diggs could find himself on the field soon; Packers coach Matt LaFleur did not rule out Diggs potentially playing as soon as Sunday's regular-season finale against the Minnesota Vikings.

""It feels good, you know?"" Diggs said of the move Thursday, via ESPN. ""I want to be comfortable with being uncomfortable being somewhere that I've never been before. Just starting over, starting fresh, a clean slate, and just working, and keeping my head down, and just working.""

Diggs arrives in Green Bay with a résumé that once stood up against the elites of the NFL but hasn't carried the same weight over the last three seasons. A two-time Pro Bowler and 2021 first-team All-Pro selection, Diggs has played in just 21 games over the last three campaigns, missed eight games in 2025 due to a concussion he admitted he suffered in an at-home accident and saw his tenure with the Cowboys -- a team that once valued him enough to hand him a lavish five-year, $97 million extension in 2023 -- end with Dallas unceremoniously waiving him just before the new year.

Despite the difficulties, Diggs' confidence remains unchanged, telling reporters Thursday he still feels ""like I'm the best."" Now, he has to prove that to his new team and an NFL audience that might be rightfully skeptical of his potential.

""I think I just need to be myself, you know? Be who I know I am,"" Diggs said. ""Go out there and perform and performing everything will take care of itself. I'm not chasing accolades. I'm not chasing anything. I'm chasing, you know, being a better me, being better every day ... helping this team win.""

Diggs stormed onto the scene in his second NFL season, logging a league-best 11 interceptions in 2021, but has since snagged just six picks over the following four seasons. He joins a Packers team that likely isn't worried about production potential and is instead more interested in adding a skilled corner to a roster that needs one after losing two (Nate Hobbs and Kamal Hadden) to injury in Saturday's loss to Baltimore.

""He can help us tremendously,"" safety Xavier McKinney said. ""He can get the ball, and I think that's one thing that we're missing, obviously, is getting the ball at a high rate. And I think he can be the guy that comes in and really helps us with that. In that way, I think it's going to be a big help for us.""

If Diggs is going to make an immediate impact in either Week 18 or Wild Card Weekend, he'll have to acclimate quickly. Luckily, he has a former Cowboys teammate, edge rusher Micah Parsons, in Green Bay to help him adjust.

""He told me, you know, it's work,"" Diggs said of Parsons, who is on injured reserve after suffering an ACL injury in Week 15. ""It's a lot different. He said I'm going to like it a lot and I'm going to enjoy it. So far, I've been enjoying it a lot. My first day was out there today, and I had a lot of fun. And it's a great, great thing to be here.""

Running back Chase Brown (illness) was out for the second straight practice. The illness Brown is dealing with hasn’t been specified, and he could still play on Sunday. If he can’t go, look for Samaje Perine and rookie Tahj Brooks to man the backfield.

Defensive end Joseph Ossai (ankle) also missed another practice, and with him missing Week 17, it is looking like his 2025 season may be over, opening the door for more snaps for rookie Shemar Stewart. Defensive tackle B.J. Hill (ankle) was out again as well after missing Wednesday.

Josh Newton (hamstring) was upgraded to a limited participant after missing Wednesday, so he may have a chance to be back in the lineup.

For Cleveland, standout rookie linebacker Carson Schwesinger (quad, ankle) was out yet again, so they could be without one of their top defenders.

Both of Cleveland’s top tight ends have missed both practices as well. David Njoku (personal) and Harold Fannin Jr. (groin) could be out of the lineup Sunday. Njoku, however, is a veteran who could play without practicing.

Guard Teven Jenkins (concussion) was upgraded to a limited participant on Thursday, but he remains in the NFL’s concussion protocol and would still need to be cleared in order to play Sunday.

Nick Underhill of New Orleans.Football first reported the news.

Luckily, the blood clot was caught early. Underhill added that Olave is being discharged on Thursday and is doing well.

Olave's season will end with 100 receptions, 1,163 receiving yards and nine receiving touchdowns, all career highs. He's the first Saints player with 100-plus receptions post-Drew Brees retirement (last was Michael Thomas' NFL record 149 in 2019).

Olave enters 2026 set to play on the fifth-year option, worth $15.493 million. He is in line for a massive contract this offseason.

Burden had no more than four catches in any game until his last two outings.
We did a great job of protecting and really flipping into that protection that we needed to handle.","The emergence of the Bears' top two picks in the 2025 draft over the past two months has helped fuel an offense that ranks in the top 10 in scoring (10th) and total yards (3rd) after finishing in the bottom five in both categories last year.

""They've progressed really since they've gotten here,"" said offensive coordinator Declan Doyle. ""Early on, they had been banged up a little bit and so they didn't have quite full offseasons. But they've just done a great job of keeping their heads down.

""I think it's a byproduct of them being very willing and growth oriented. It's an environment that encourages that, and then the position coaches have done a great job with both of those guys staying on them and continuing to push them to grow.""

Loveland, a first-round selection, missed all offseason practices while recovering from shoulder surgery, while Burden, a second-round choice, sat out most offseason workouts and the first few days of training camp with a hamstring injury. Neither rookie, however, allowed that to stop them from blossoming into a key contributor on a division championship team.

""It's not something that happens a lot, and yet it's not something outside of the realm,"" Doyle said. ""When you watch their habits and how they work every single day and you see them go out and have success on Sunday, it ties together, it makes sense.""

After averaging 1.8 catches and 19.3 yards with no touchdowns in six games played in September and October, Loveland averaged 4.1 receptions and 56.2 yards with five TDs in nine contests in November and December.

""[I've been] getting a couple more targets and a couple more opportunities to make plays and I've been doing so for the most part, which has been good,"" Loveland said. ""It's been a blessing. I've always trusted the process, trusted coaches and trusted my teammates.""

Burden had no more than four catches in any game until his last two outings. He had six receptions for 84 yards in a win over the Browns, and after missing the overtime victory over the Packers with an ankle injury, established career highs last Sunday night in San Francisco with eight catches and 138 yards, including a 35-yard TD from Caleb Williams.

""I'm super blessed,"" Burden said. ""Me and Colston came here, and we set our goals and winning the division was one of them … I feel like coach [Ben Johnson] is getting us more involved and Caleb is doing a great job spreading the ball around. We're just taking our opportunities and making the most of them.""

""You see a guy who is more in command as far as when he's up there and utilizing the cadence to an advantage,"" Doyle said. ""We talked about that a lot when we first got here, just our cadence being something that we wanted to kind of hang our hat on. It helps you in a lot of different ways, being under center and your guys being able to come off the ball and get a little bit of an edge just because the quarterback's cadence is consistent.

""That's a situation that we practice quite frequently. They jumped; we pulled the trigger at center. We did a great job of protecting and really flipping into that protection that we needed to handle. [Williams] did a good job of working out there, and then Loveland able to separate and we create a big play down the field. We create a touchdown and it's really all of [Williams'] cadence.""

""That speaks to the quarterback, that speaks to [center] Drew [Dalman] being able to direct things,"" Doyle said. ""You've been in 17 battles together and there's shared experience as far as how we handle problems, how we handle things that might come up that are unscouted, and the communication is much cleaner.

""And then just confidence. Confidence is born of demonstrated ability, and so they've seen themselves perform at the highest level at times.

The Rams have signed Lake to a three-year contract extension, the team announced Thursday.
The new deal comes the day Lake returned to practice after a six-week trip to injured reserve to repair a dislocated elbow.
In the six games since that injury, Los Angeles has surrendered 25.6 points per game.
“You don’t replace a Quentin Lake,” coach Sean McVay said at the time of the injury.","WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. — Los Angeles Rams safety Quentin Lake made his return to practice this week, and he came back to quite a reward.

The Rams have signed Lake to a three-year contract extension, the team announced Thursday. The three-year deal is worth $42 million with $25.7 million of it guaranteed, a league source confirmed to The Athletic.

The new deal comes the day Lake returned to practice after a six-week trip to injured reserve to repair a dislocated elbow. The return was all about getting the top leader on defense back into the fold, and now the Rams are making that status clear with a rare in-season extension.

This is the second in-season extension on defense this year, along with linebacker Nate Landman’s three-year deal. The Rams typically wait until the offseason to negotiate with their players, but it was always a goal to sign a deal with Lake, who spent much of his childhood in Los Angeles before playing at UCLA and then getting drafted by the Rams.

“This is a place I’d love to play for, for the rest of my career,” Lake said earlier this season.

Lake’s impact is hard to ignore, whether he’s on the field or not. The 2022 sixth-round pick grew from a special-teamer and backup his first two seasons to a full-time starter last year, when he racked up 111 tackles. This season showed a growth in playmaking from him, as he intercepted his first pass, forced a fumble, recovered a fumble and added a sack through 10 games before the injury.

Lake’s play defines the scheme that coordinator Chris Shula runs, which deploys four- and five-man fronts with heavy zone coverage and dime defenses built to hold serve against the run with lighter bodies and confuse the quarterback with pre- and post-snap coverage movement. Lake mastered that role in his fourth season by rotating from nickel cornerback to strong safety to free safety while also communicating those changing coverages to younger players as a team captain.

With Lake starting this season, the Rams boasted one of the best defenses across the board, despite fielding the lowest-paid offensive or defensive unit on any NFL team. Through 10 games, the Rams allowed just 17.2 points per game.

In the six games since that injury, Los Angeles has surrendered 25.6 points per game. The defense had a strong showing the next week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but the Rams lost 31-28 to the Carolina Panthers when they couldn’t turn Bryce Young over, and the run defense showed leakage for the first time. They then allowed 34 points to the Detroit Lions, 38 to the Seattle Seahawks and 27 to the Atlanta Falcons. They went 3-3 in that stretch, after an 8-2 start with Lake.

Lake had always been targeting a return for the postseason. The Rams opened his 21-day practice window for Thursday’s practice and expect him to make his in-game return for the wild-card round next week, when Los Angeles will play on the road.

“You don’t replace a Quentin Lake,” coach Sean McVay said at the time of the injury. “He’s so valuable for so many reasons with what he can do, with who he is as a human, with the way that he elevates and leads. He’s a glue guy for us.”

Now, the franchise has shown it means that.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/01152925/GettyImages-2241084426-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-02 05:58:37.784637

Simpson said he had an X-ray at halftime, and he was on the field to start the second half for the Crimson Tide.

Simpson said the injury occurred after he took a helmet to the rib while scrambling for a first down late in the first half. He fumbled on the play, however, and Indiana recovered.

""Felt like I had a good thing going on that drive when I got hit,"" said Simpson, who completed 12 of 16 passes for only 67 yards in the game. ""It kind of changed the momentum for sure. ... The competitor in me wanted to make sure I got the first down. Got more than the first down, and then should have been smart and just got down.""

Simpson said he had an X-ray at halftime, and he was on the field to start the second half for the Crimson Tide. After a three-and-out, he said he realized that he couldn't play through the injury and ""I made an executive decision and thought [about] what gave us the best chance to win.""

Backup Austin Mack played the rest of the game for Alabama.

Said Simpson: ""I thought Austin being 100 percent could help us win.""

Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said Simpson wanted to see if he could continue to play in the second half.

""We treated him there at halftime and he gave it a series, and I know he feels like he let down the team -- and there's no way that that's the case,"" DeBoer said. ""He went out there and tried to battle, and that's who he is. And so I'm never going to let that be a thing where he [thinks he] let us down in any way.""

Mack, a redshirt sophomore who has completed 13 of 16 passes this season for 125 yards, guided the Crimson Tide to a field goal on his first drive for Alabama's first -- and only -- points of the game.

Mack, a third-year sophomore, went 11-of-16 for 103 yards against the Hoosiers with three sacks.

If Williams is unable to play, the 49ers will turn to Austen Pleasants to make his first career NFL start. He entered the NFL as an undrafted rookie in 2020 and spent time with five teams before joining the 49ers late last season. He saw considerable action in the final two games of 2024 while splitting time with Charlie Heck after the 49ers lost their top three left tackles due to injuries. Pleasants earned a spot on the 49ers’ 53-man roster after a strong training camp.

“A big thing for him is every Wednesday, since he's been our swing tackle, is Trent takes Wednesdays off,” general manager John Lynch said on 49ers Game Plan. “We give him (Williams) Wednesdays off to get his body back. And he (Pleasants) has taken advantage of those opportunities, and I think that gives him some comfort. He's worked with the starters before.”

Pleasants was called upon Sunday night against the Chicago Bears when Williams sustained a hamstring injury while chasing linebacker T.J. Edwards’ 34-yard interception return for a touchdown. Pleasants entered the game at the beginning of the next possession and played the final 71 snaps in the 49ers’ 42-38 victory.

White has played approximately 60 percent of the 49ers’ defensive snaps as part of the 49ers’ defensive line rotation since arriving in a mid-season trade from New England.

Cornerback Renardo Green is also set to be back after missing two games with a neck condition.

Epps, 29, is now in the NFL’s concussion protocol and will have to clear that protocol before he’s able to return.

The Eagles have already elected to rest key starters for their Week 18 game against the Commanders but it’s unclear if the plan was to play Epps. The veteran has played well next to Reed Blankenship in the second half of this season and has helped solidify the back end of the defense.

Here’s the full injury report from Thursday:

Full: LB Jihaad Campbell (back/shoulder), S Marcus Epps (concussion)

NFL

Epps this season has played in 12 games and has started 4. He has played very well since taking over the starting job. Epps’ experience has been on display the last month.

For most of the season, the Eagles started rookie Drew Mukuba at the safety spot next to Blankenship in the secondary but Mukuba fractured his ankle in Dallas on Nov. 23 and has been on Injured Reserve after having surgery. The Eagles started Sydney Brown for one game before activating Epps off IR from a shoulder injury and starting him.

The Eagles initially signed Epps to their practice squad after training camp but eventually signed him to the 53-man roster. Before his IR stint coming off the bye week, Epps had played just 15 defensive snaps all season. Since his return, he has played 235 and is fully expected to be the starter when the playoffs begin next weekend.

Epps is in his seventh NFL season and his second stint with the Eagles. He was a full-time starter for the Super Bowl season in 2022.",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/12/Epps-M-Getty-2241956265.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-01 19:58:07.504504

NFL

LB Jihaad Campbell (back/shoulder) was practicing after being listed as limited to start the week. This should be his second straight start.

And OT Cameron Williams (shoulder) was practicing after being listed as a full participant to start the week. The Eagles activated Williams off IR to the 53-man roster, which means the sixth-round pick will make his NFL debut on Sunday. Williams on Thursday was removed from the injury report after being activated.

The Eagles are going to rest many key starters for their Week 18 game against the Commanders, so it’s not a big deal that Johnson, Dean, Goedert and Phillips are not practicing this week. They will obviously not play against the Commanders as the Eagles rest up for their wild-card round game the following week.

Johnson will miss his seventh consultive game after suffering a Lisfranc sprain against the Lions on Nov. 16 and Dean will miss his second after suffering a hamstring injury against the Commanders on Dec. 20.

Phillips suffered that ankle injury in the win over Buffalo and could probably use a bye week anyway; he has already played in 17 games this season because of the timing of his trade from the Dolphins to the Eagles. Goedert has missed just one game all year but will likely sit in this regular season finale.

Some Eagles starters are going to be inactive on Sunday, while others will be limited and some will dress out but will not play.

Olave is eligible for a contract extension this offseason and set to make more than $15 million next season after the Saints picked up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract.

McCarthy missed last week’s game with a right-hand injury. He practiced in full Thursday for the first time since exiting the Week 16 game against the New York Giants with the injury.

“I felt like the ball was spinning,” McCarthy said after Wednesday’s practice. “We’ll take it day to day.”

Earlier in the season, head coach Kevin O’Connell suggested that McCarthy needed a full week of practice to give him the best chance at optimal performance. The circumstances are different this late in the season. O’Connell said Monday the team would love to get McCarthy one final opportunity.

It’s been a rollercoaster of a season for the 2024 first-round pick. McCarthy, 22, has missed seven games due to three injuries: a high-ankle sprain, a concussion and currently a hairline fracture in his throwing hand. He struggled early in the season, then found his footing from Weeks 14-16. Improved accuracy and decisiveness provided optimism about McCarthy’s trajectory. He called having to miss the Week 17 victory versus the Lions “extremely tough.”

“I’ve had a lot of ups and downs and twists and turns,” McCarthy said. “But at the end of the day, it’s a beautiful picture and a beautiful story that I’m really starting to understand the meaning of. And the reasoning behind it. And we’re not done yet.”

Green Bay has secured its playoff bid, so it may not play most of its starters. Regardless, this is an opportunity for McCarthy to give a closing statement on his first season as a starter ahead of a critical offseason. The current Vikings regime has not won a playoff game. Flipping that will likely be the expectation in 2026, which will require a particular baseline level of play at the quarterback position.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/01165836/GettyImages-2252294261-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-01 19:58:29.176813

Mayfield suffered a left shoulder injury against the Rams earlier in the season but returned the next week.
As to whether the right shoulder injury could affect Mayfield on Saturday, though, shouldn't change his availability, said Brown.","CHARLOTTE — Claudin Cherelus was out of the boot he was wearing all week on Thursday, but he's not ready to play, which is forcing the Panthers to adjust at linebacker again this week.

With Cherelus ruled out, the Panthers are thin at the position, with veteran Krys Barnes and rookie Bam Martin-Scott up next to play next to Christian Rozeboom.

Barnes has played in 74 games with 32 starts in his career, but he didn't practice Tuesday because of a back issue. He's listed as questionable on the final injury report.

Martin-Scott has played defense in a couple of games this year (San Francisco and Seattle).

""We've been working him back in, looking better and better each day; so hopefully we'll get him out there,"" Panthers head coach Dave Canales said of Barnes. ""Krys has played some good snaps for us, and then we got a couple of other guys.""

Canales said if need be, known commodity Jacoby Windmon could be activated from the practice squad for depth.

But obviously, Barnes' experience is significant in a situation like this with the playoffs on the line.

""Extremely valuable,"" Canales said. ""Just with the week of preparation, and what do you do? You don't do anything different. You go about it the same way, and you attack the work, and Krys has been a stud for us. We've asked him to play special teams roles, pop in there and play linebacker for us, he's a guy that can handle a lot and has really good experience within our scheme. So, really fortunate that he's here.""

Hunt and Moore's status remains questionable

Offensive lineman Robert Hunt and receiver David Moore both continued to practice this week, within their 21-day window to be activated. Both are officially considered questionable for the game, but Canales isn't quite ready to commit to either playing on Saturday against the Buccaneers. However, it is for different reasons.

""David had a fantastic week, you know, at this point it's just about figuring out, roster-wise, when that makes sense for us,"" Canales explained. The roster is currently full at 53 men, so for Moore to be activated, a man would have to be cut.

As for Hunt, it remains a matter of having him physically ready.

""Rob was able to do a little bit more, but we got to see how his body responds tomorrow (Friday), and that's why, you know, it's questionable right now for Rob.

""We were able to kind of ramp up his work, but it's like the recovery of what does this thing feel like the next day, where are we at in terms of football, whole football readiness.""

Some of the challenges with testing Hunt's readiness stem from the fact that teams are not in pads at this late stage of the season. And for an offensive lineman, a lot of their work centers around being as physical as possible, something that isn't full tested unless in pads.

""We were able to simulate some things from a physical standpoint,"" Canales shared, before continuing, ""Not being in pads certainly does present its challenges. If we were just practicing in the normal scheme of the season and being able to hit each other and all that, you can gather a little bit more information.""

However, considering Hunt's injury is in his biceps, the coaches can still gather a lot of information from non-padded drills.

""The nature of the injury, he just needs that physical change of direction and getting his hands split the right way. So we were able to evaluate some of that.""

No question about Baker Mayfield's toughness

Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield popped up on Tampa Bay's injury report this week with right shoulder and knee. He was a limited participant on Tuesday, but was able to practice fully on Wednesday.

Those who know him well, such as Canales (who was Mayfield's coordinator in Tampa in 2023) and Derrick Brown (who was teammates with Mayfield in Carolina), fully expect to see him on the field Saturday.

""My short time with Baker, this is a tough guy. This is a competitor. He's a great teammate. He's going to be out there with this team, and he's going to give everything he has,"" Canales said Thursday. ""We got to expect that. We got to be ready for that version of Baker, and, so, and I respect him for it, and I've seen him battle through things and find his way to game day and give everything he has.""

Mayfield suffered a left shoulder injury against the Rams earlier in the season but returned the next week. The left shoulder is Mayfield's non-throwing shoulder, but he has thrown five of his 10 interceptions in the five games since. As to whether the right shoulder injury could affect Mayfield on Saturday, though, shouldn't change his availability, said Brown.

""Knowing 6, he'll be out there Saturday,"" said Brown. ""He'll be out there for sure. So, you know, I think he's the ultimate competitor, so we'll see him out there Saturday.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/panthers/ljrj14tfqvdmlwt4czub,N,,2026-01-01 18:58:47.232081

Ravens quarterback Tyler “Snoop” Huntley started in Jackson’s absence and went 16-of-20 passing for 107 yards and one touchdown. Huntley was aided by running back Derrick Henry, who rushed for 216 yards and four touchdowns, both of which were career highs with the Ravens.

Jackson practiced Wednesday and Thursday and will wear extra padding to protect his back. Before the back injury, Jackson dealt with hamstring, toe and knee injuries this season. He missed three games earlier in the season with a hamstring injury.

Jackson’s injuries this season have limited his mobility. His 63 rushing attempts, 340 rushing yards, and 2 rushing touchdowns are all career-low numbers for Jackson.

Despite the season being on the line, the Ravens’ concerns extend beyond this season. The Baltimore Sun reported on the team's frustration with Jackson’s practice and preparation habits. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh and Jackson denied the report.

Harbaugh has also been under fire for the 1-4 start to the season and the lack of playoff success in recent history.

No practice

RT Penei Sewell (ankle)

IOL Trystan Colon (wrist)

DT Alim McNeill (abdomen)

Sewell has now missed back-to-back practices, and it’s fair to speculate if he’ll play this week, considering coach Dan Campbell’s comments earlier in the week surrounding playing injured players. At the same time, Sewel has taken two practices off earlier in the season and was still able to play by Sunday, so there is still a chance he plays on Sunday.

Colon missing two practices with a lingering wrist injury he has previously played through is unusual, and could be a sign he re-aggravated it.

McNeill showed up on last week’s injury report, then exited Week 17 very early and has not practiced since. His status for this Sunday’s game is very much up in the air.

Limited practice

WR Amon-Ra St. Brown (knee/ankle) — upgraded from no practice

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder/illness)

LG Christian Mahogany (illness) — upgraded from no practice

OL Kayode Awosika (illness) — upgraded from no practice

OT Giovanni Manu (knee) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 6

LB Alex Anzalone (concussion) — upgraded from no practice

SAF Thomas Harper (concussion) — upgraded from no practice

St. Brown hopes to be able to play this weekend, per Campbell, and a return to practice on Thursday sets him up for that. He’ll need to participate on Friday in some capacity, but signs are pointing up. St. Brown talked to our Jeremy Reisman in the locker room on Thursday.

“I feel solid. I would say a little banged up, but good enough to go, so that’s all that really matters.”

St. Brown would go on to add that he doesn’t believe there is any long-term injury risk involved for him with his current ailment:

“I don’t think so. Obviously, there’s risk in any game you play with any injury, but to answer your question, I don’t think so.”

Decker getting in a second practice this week is a good sign that he’ll be able to finish out the season on the football field.

Mahogany and Awosika returned from their illnesses, a good sign that they’re likely to be available on Sunday.

Manu is closing out his injury evaluation window, but it’s still not entirely clear if he’ll be activated and play this weekend. Sewell’s health could be a factor in determining that.

Anzalone and Harper both returned to practice on Thursday, suggesting they’re progressing through the NFL injury protocols. That being said, there are still hurdles to clear, and there’s no guarantee either play, especially Harper, who is dealing with his second concussion this season.

Maddox getting in back-to-back practices after missing last week’s game is a good sign he’s on track to return, though there is no guarantee, as we’ve seen many times this season.

Joining the limited, both starters were back at practice as Miami Dolphins prep continued inside the WIN Waste Innovations Field House. But fullback Jack Westover, guard Jared Wilson, defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga, as well as linebackers Harold Landry III and Robert Spillane remained non-participants.

Here’s the second injury report leading up to Sunday’s 4:25 p.m. ET season finale at Gillette Stadium.

After beginning the week with seven sidelined, the Patriots went forward with five sidelined. Wilson, Tonga, Landry and Spillane had all been ruled out ahead of what became a 42-10 win over the New York Jets last Sunday. But the visit to MetLife Stadium also ended without Westover due to an ankle injury that surfaced on a kickoff in the fourth quarter.

The Patriots had four partial participants on hand. After catching his seventh touchdown and eclipsing 700 receiving yards for the first time in his NFL career, Henry missed practice on New Year’s Eve due to a knee injury. And across the line of scrimmage, Barmore, who is facing a domestic assault charge stemming from August, had also been absent due to an illness. Elsewhere, two players whose 21-day practice windows opened over the past week remained limited. Ankle and wrist injuries sent Williams and Austin to injured reserve in November. Both await activation.

Boutte went without a non-contact jersey after spending the past week in the NFL’s concussion protocol. The wide receiver has caught 31 passes for 527 yards and six touchdowns through 13 appearances this campaign. He was among six full participants for the Patriots as 2026 arrived. The No. 4 overall pick was, too. Campbell spent the past four games on injured reserve due to a knee injury. The rookie left tackle had been listed as limited to begin the week.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2249994956.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.752529846059%2C100%2C78.494940307882&w=1200,N,,2026-01-01 19:58:35.328824

The Bills quarterback did not practice on Wednesday or Thursday.

With the Bills seemingly destined to finish as the No. 6 seed in the AFC, and given that they’re playing the Jets, it could make sense to give Allen all or most of the day off on Sunday.

The injury happened in Week 16 against the Browns, on a long self-sack play. He finished the game, but his post-game contention that the foot didn’t affect him in the second half wasn’t convincing.

After seemingly aggravating it against the Eagles, Allen insisted it had “zero” impact on him. (And then he went to the X-ray room.) Meanwhile, Allen possibly rushed his throw on the fateful two-point misfire to receiver Khalil Shakir so that he wouldn’t have to try to run away on the injured foot from Eagles linebacker Jaelan Phillips.

Given that Sunday will likely be the last game at Highmark Stadium, maybe the Bills will give Allen a drive or two. Or maybe just one snap so he officially gets the start in the final game. There’s no point in risking further aggravation to his foot, not with the playoffs looming — and with Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow, and possibly Lamar Jackson not among the quarterbacks Allen may face.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dd1df61/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7169x4033+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fc2%2Fb1%2F3d40da4641e6adf5fa91d71205ba%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2254071059,N,,2026-01-01 17:57:53.600510
