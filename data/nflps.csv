What does that mean?

Hollins likely won’t be activated to return this week, but opening his practice window puts him in a position to play as soon as Sunday. If not, he’ll be eligible to continue practicing and can be activated at any point until the day before Super Bowl LX.

The Patriots would certainly be eager to bring the veteran wide receiver back into the fold, as he finished third on the team in receptions (46) and fourth in receiving yards (550) despite suffering his injury and missing the final two regular season games against the New York Giants and Miami Dolphins.

The operation was conducted Tuesday in Alabama. Nix sent out a heartfelt message on his Instagram account Wednesday.

""What started as one of the most exciting games I’ve ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I’ve ever received. This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it.

Winners will be announced at NFL Honors on Thursday, Feb. 5 at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco. The show will air at 8 p.m. CT on NBC and NFL Network.

It's the latest in a series of accolades for Parsons, who earlier this month was voted first-team All-Pro as determined by a vote of 50 media members of the AP.

Acquired in an August trade with Dallas, Parsons tallied 41 tackles, 12½ sacks, 26 quarterback hits and 83 pressures, according to NFL Next Gen Stats, in 14 games with Green Bay.

Parsons tore his anterior cruciate ligament against the Denver Broncos in December but still earned a fifth consecutive Pro Bowl selection (2021-2025).

“What I would tell you, because it deals with allegedly the health and safety of our players, I think you have to look into everything,” G.M. John Lynch told reporters on Wednesday. “So, our guys have been — we’ve been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and by coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means. That’s what we know exists. We’ve heard that debunked. So yes, we will look into it. We have. The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We pour into it.

The 49ers have practiced in the same facility since 1988, winning three Super Bowls in the first seven years there. And even if there’s nothing to the electricity angle, the 49ers have had too many injuries in recent years.

“The health and performance of our players is at the utmost priority each and every year,” Lynch said. “You know, this year it was tough and it took a toll on our team. We’ll continue to look. Now, having said that, we’ve spent a lot of time and effort in recruiting really quality people and I think being at the forefront of injury prevention. I think this year probably because the star players that that went down there was a lot of attention given on that. The fact of the matter is injuries are a part of this game.

That, of course, ended his season and required surgery to repair, and putting him on a very long road to recovery.
Add in four fourth-quarter comebacks and three game-winning drives and it was the best showing from Prescott since 2023, when he was named finalist for NFL MVP before ending as runner-up to Lamar Jackson, one year after having been named Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2022.
That season, Prescott threw for only one fewer interception (9), six more touchdowns (36), two more first downs (222), and just 36 more passing yards on six more passing attempts.
Even more impressive was Prescott's ability to scramble, something that appeared rejuvenated despite the brutal hamstring injury suffered only months prior.","FRISCO, Texas — It goes without saying that the Dallas Cowboys didn't end their 2025 campaign in the way they had envisioned, but it's equally as obvious that Dak Prescott did all he could to try and change the team's fate. And as the calendar nears February, the All-Pro quarterback is being rewarded for his efforts in keeping the team afloat when they otherwise wouldn't have been.

Prescott has been named a finalist for the 2025 NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, giving him a very real chance at adding to his growing list of achievements — also honored with his fourth Pro Bowl nod this past season.

It marks the second time Prescott has been named a finalist for the award, the first being in 2021, named runner-up at the time to Cincinnati Bengals' quarterback Joe Burrow, in a year that saw the Cowboys' quarterback return from a season-ending ankle injury that cost him a total of 11 games in 2020, then racking up career-best numbers in the season that followed.

The All-Pro was a man possessed for much of 2025, an impressive feat when considering Prescott suffered a catastrophic injury in Week 8 against the Atlanta Falcons, attempting to escape pressure to make a play, that resulted in his hamstring being torn off of the bone. That, of course, ended his season and required surgery to repair, and putting him on a very long road to recovery.

A little less than nine months later, Prescott was on the field to begin training camp — not on the team's physically unable to perform (PUP) list — igniting Oxnard as arguably the MVP of the three-week program, but that was ultimately just a taste of what was to come, and particularly with the addition of George Pickens via trade to join CeeDee Lamb.

Before the season was all said-and-done, Prescott had overtaken Tony Romo as the Cowboys’ all-time passing leader, going on to start in all 17 games en route to throwing for 4,552 passing yards (the second-highest of his career) and 30 touchdowns (tied for third-highest of his career) to only 10 interceptions (tied for second-fewest through with a minimum of 16 games played).

Add in four fourth-quarter comebacks and three game-winning drives and it was the best showing from Prescott since 2023, when he was named finalist for NFL MVP before ending as runner-up to Lamar Jackson, one year after having been named Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2022.

That season, Prescott threw for only one fewer interception (9), six more touchdowns (36), two more first downs (222), and just 36 more passing yards on six more passing attempts. Even more impressive was Prescott's ability to scramble, something that appeared rejuvenated despite the brutal hamstring injury suffered only months prior.

He rushed for 177 yards and two touchdowns, numbers that were also comparable to 2023, along with 15 first downs that kept the chains moving in critical moments — also using his legs to extend plays that eventually turned into downfield highlights for Lamb, Pickens and others.

If he walks away with this year's NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award, it will mark only the second time a Cowboys' player has won it, the first being former Pro Bowl edge rusher Greg Ellis, when he earned the honor for his work that produced 12.5 sacks in 2007, after his return from a torn Achilles suffered in 2006.

For NFL football players, disability insurance for athletes exists at the intersection of physical risk and financial reality.","Disability Insurance for athletes sits at the center of income protection for NFL football players whose careers can end instantly after a single hit. Professional football exposes players to repeated collisions that place future earnings at risk long before most workers reach peak income years. Unlike salaried professions, NFL income depends on continued physical performance, and when that performance stops, paychecks often stop with it.

The average NFL career spans only a small number of seasons, yet many players enter the league with financial expectations tied to long-term earning potential. Contracts are frequently structured with limited guarantees, meaning injuries can terminate salary, bonuses, and roster status at once.

Studies of the NFL labor market show that severe injuries shorten careers and permanently reduce lifetime earnings, even for players who reach elite levels of performance, researchers report.

Income loss does not occur only at retirement. An ACL tear, spinal injury, or concussion history can reduce playing time, limit future contracts, or force early exit from the league. These losses often arrive without warning, leaving little time to replace earnings that were expected to last several more seasons.

Disability insurance differs from medical coverage because it is designed to replace income rather than pay treatment bills. For NFL football players, whose occupation depends entirely on physical ability, disability insurance focuses on what happens when the ability to play is lost, not just when injuries occur. That distinction becomes critical when an injury permanently ends a player’s earning capacity on the field.

NFL Injury Risk and Long-Term Threat to Player Income

Injury risk in professional football does not end when a player leaves the field for the last time. Former NFL players face elevated rates of chronic pain, joint disease, depression, and cognitive symptoms that can interfere with post-football employment. These conditions can limit a former player’s ability to earn income in coaching, broadcasting, business, or other second careers, medical researchers report.

Long-term data shows that health risks rise with additional years of play. “Having a longer NFL career significantly increased risk of cognitive impairment and depression later in life,” researchers reported, noting that “with each additional five years of play, the risk for self-reported cognitive impairment increased by 20%,” according to the Football Players Health Study at Harvard University.

Neurological symptoms create particular financial strain because they may worsen gradually rather than appear immediately after retirement. Cognitive problems, headaches, and mood instability can limit a former player’s ability to maintain steady work even when physical injuries appear manageable. These symptoms often emerge years after playing careers end, complicating income planning.

A large study of nearly 2,000 former NFL players found that about one-third believed they had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and those players reported significantly higher rates of cognitive problems, depression, suicidality, and chronic pain than peers without those concerns, investigators reported.

NFL Disability Benefits and Limits of League Coverage

NFL players are eligible for disability benefits through plans administered by the league and the NFL Players Association. These benefits provide monthly payments under specific disability classifications and eligibility criteria outlined in plan documents. Coverage varies based on service time, medical evidence, and disability determinations.

However, league benefits operate within standardized limits that may not reflect individual earning trajectories. A player with high projected future income may receive the same benefit level as a peer with shorter expected earnings, leaving a portion of income unprotected if a career ends early.

Disability claims under league plans can also involve administrative review processes that take time to resolve. Conditions that worsen gradually, such as neurological or musculoskeletal disorders, can be especially difficult to evaluate under strict definitions of disability.

Because of these structural limits, some players rely on individual disability insurance policies that are designed around expected earnings and occupation-specific risk. These policies focus on replacing income tied to playing ability rather than providing a flat benefit unrelated to prior compensation.

Medical Evidence Links NFL Careers to Long-Term Disability Risk

Researchers studying former NFL players emphasize that many symptoms attributed to irreversible brain disease may also stem from treatable conditions.

“Many conditions common to former NFL players, such as sleep apnea, low testosterone, high blood pressure, and chronic pain, can cause problems with thinking, memory, and concentration,” said Rachel Grashow, first author of the Harvard-led study examining CTE concerns among former players.

While CTE cannot be diagnosed during life, researchers caution that uncertainty itself can create emotional and financial stress. “While we wait for advances in CTE research to better address living players’ experiences, it is imperative that we identify conditions that are treatable,” Grashow added, noting that misattributing symptoms can lead to hopelessness and worsen mental health outcomes.

From an income protection perspective, uncertainty around long-term health can directly affect employability. Cognitive symptoms, chronic pain, and mental health challenges may limit a former player’s ability to sustain post-football income, even when physical injuries appear less visible. These risks compound the financial impact of early career endings.

For NFL football players, disability insurance for athletes exists at the intersection of physical risk and financial reality. When careers end earlier than expected and long-term health remains uncertain, income protection becomes less about planning for retirement and more about managing sudden and lasting loss of earning capacity.

Nix has opened up in a letter for the first time since he was diagnosed with the injury.

“What started as one of the most exciting games I’ve ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I’ve ever received. This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined byovercoming adversity and responding to it,” Nix wrote.

With Nix out for the remainder of the postseason, Jarrett Stidham will be the next man up as the starting quarterback, and everybody has the ultimate belief in him to get the job done.

“I can’t express how much this team and organization mean to me and how much I believe in them. I couldn’t be more proud of our guys. I couldn’t be more confident in Jarrett. And I couldn’t be more excited for what’s next,” Nix wrote.

The Broncos had a great regular season, and though it was their defense that led them through the way, Nix and the offense held their own. In his second season, Nix finished with 3,291 passing yards, 25 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.

Now, the Broncos may have to rely on their defense even more against the New England Patriots if they want a chance in the AFC Championship Game. The Patriots also don’t have much information on Stidham, so that could either work in the Broncos’ favor or it could hurt them since he hasn’t gotten many reps as QB1 throughout his career.

In the end, it was a great season for Nix, and he did all he could to help the Broncos get to where they are now. It’s up to the team to finish the job.

Analysis by The Athletic’s Jack Pitt-Brooke

The news that Lucas Bergvall is set for another spell on the sidelines with an ankle injury has come at a bad time for Tottenham.

Midfield has been an issue all season for Spurs, but even more so recently because of injuries. Rodrigo Bentancur, who had been Tottenham’s most reliable midfielder, underwent hamstring surgery earlier this month and will be out for a significant period of time. James Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski, of course, are both recovering from knee operations of their own.

Bergvall has been in and out of the team recently and had only just recovered from a groin injury when he sustained this new problem against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday.

Frank will now be without Bergvall’s energy and tenacity in the next period of games. Spurs have already bought Conor Gallagher this window, a reaction in part to Bentancur’s hamstring injury.

As part of the effort, general manager John Lynch announced Wednesday that the 49ers will even look into a viral conspiracy theory suggesting the electrical substation near the training facility and Levi's Stadium could be contributing to the team's injury woes.

""Because it deals with, allegedly, the health and safety of our players, I think you have to look into everything,"" Lynch said, per ESPN's Nick Wagoner. ""We've been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see, does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means? That's what we know exists. We've heard that debunked.""

The online theory claims the Niners' long history of injuries, dating back over a decade, can be partially linked to excessive exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF).

Although many scientists and medical professionals have dismissed the theory, Lynch emphasized that the organization wouldn't ""turn a blind eye"" to any possibility that could affect player health and safety.

The 49ers' training facility has been located in Santa Clara, California, since the late 1980s, with the substation built a few years later. The station was expanded in 2014, in conjunction with the opening of Levi's Stadium.

Lynch added that the Niners will conduct a detailed assessment of their injury prevention and management strategies, looking well beyond the conspiracy theory to address all potential factors contributing to the issue.

""We'll look at everything, and we'll examine everything,"" Lynch said.

San Francisco lost several key contributors to season-ending injuries this past campaign. Fred Warner, Nick Bosa, and George Kittle were among 20 players the 49ers placed on a reserve list. Quarterback Brock Purdy missed several games due to turf toe, while Ricky Pearsall and Jauan Jennings were sidelined for multiple weeks.",https://assets-cms.thescore.com/uploads/image/file/818527/w768xh576_GettyImages-2254534835.jpg?ts=1769040745,N,,2026-01-22 04:39:42.649403

The six total games this season were the most Kittle has missed in a season since 2020.","A player suffering a torn Achilles tendon toward the end of the season is a tough blow and oftentimes could mean missing a large portion of the following year.

But, in the case of George Kittle’s recovery from the torn Achilles he suffered in the playoffs, Kittle and the 49ers organization have a high level of optimism despite the unknown.

“What I do know, right out of surgery, Dr. [Neal] ElAttrache called and just went into great detail as to why it was a real success..."" general manager John Lynch told reporters Wednesday, “...the outcome was really good, and there's a lot of reason to be optimistic where the tear was and such.”

The surgery to repair Kittle’s torn Achilles was performed by Dr. ElAttrache, who performs many athletes’ procedures to repair injured tendons and ligaments.

Lynch declined to give a specific timeline for Kittle’s return, but he echoed the tight end’s optimism that the 49ers star had when he talked to reporters Monday.

“Best case scenario when you tear an Achilles, is that you tear it up high by your soleus, which is what I did,” Kittle said. “I had a clean tear, they didn’t have to drill into my heel, and where the repair was, is where there is more blood flow and so it takes some time off of the recovery time.”

Kittle’s typical high spirits were quick to return after the injury and he already has spent time with the team.

“He's already been around our team with that infectious personality. And you know, George was down for a little bit, but he's already flipped the switch to recover,” Lynch noted. “George will attack it in a great way. We're very hopeful to have him back.”

Much of Lynch’s optimism about Kittle’s path back to the field is based on how recovery has improved since his playing days. Achilles tears used to be a death knell for players’ careers, but sports medicine practices have improved greatly over the last 30 years.

“I remember when I first started playing, you had an Achilles and everybody's like -- ‘Oh man, that's tough, you're never the same.’ That's not the case anymore,” Lynch said. “I think like a lot of things, they've gotten much better at the surgeries.”

“They've gotten much better and more aggressive in the rehab and how quickly you get after it. And I think that will be the case for George.”

Kittle, 32, finished the 2025 season with 628 receiving yards on 69 receptions. He missed five of the 49ers’ first six games with a hamstring injury, and missed Week 17 against the Chicago Bears with an ankle sprain.

The six total games this season were the most Kittle has missed in a season since 2020.

“I don’t think Bo Nix is heavily regarded as an elite quarterback in the league or a true game-changer,” Feazel said.
“This is not like a Super Bowl where it’s very artificial the way the crowd is and all the hoopla.
The four most recent teams to accomplish that went to win the Super Bowl.
NFC title game winner a Super Bowl favorite BetMGM and Caesars list the Seahawks and Rams as two leading favorites to win the Super Bowl.","LAS VEGAS (AP) — Denver would be a slight favorite if quarterback Bo Nix was healthy and ready to play Sunday in the AFC championship game, but the Broncos instead are fairly substantial underdogs to New England.

It’s a development that has caused some head shaking in the sports betting industry.

The Broncos would be about 1 1/2-point favorites in the AFC championship game, but as of Wednesday afternoon, the Patriots were favored by 5 points at BetMGM Sportsbook and 4 1/2 at Caesars Sportsbook.

“Typically, a quarterback is worth about four points to the line,” BetMGM sports trader Christian Cipollini said. “This line movement based off that opening line is pretty close to six or seven, which I find pretty interesting. I personally think as we get closer to kickoff, it’ll come back closer to the Broncos. I think this will close maybe 3 1/2, 4, but we’ll see what happens.”

Nix is out for the remainder of the postseason after breaking his right ankle late in Saturday’s 33-30 victory over Buffalo in the divisional playoffs round. Jarrett Stidham, who last started a game in 2023, will take his place.

Joey Feazel, head of football at Caesars, said he was surprised to see such a significant line movement.

“I don’t think Bo Nix is heavily regarded as an elite quarterback in the league or a true game-changer,” Feazel said. “Obviously, he made some really good throws this past weekend and has been consistent throughout the year.”

CBS SportsLine handicapper Bruce Marshall is a buyer on the Broncos. He likes Denver coach Sean Payton’s history of getting quality play out of his backup quarterbacks going back to his days in New Orleans.

“I think they’ve inflated this line too much,” Marshall said. “This is not like a Super Bowl where it’s very artificial the way the crowd is and all the hoopla. This is still like a regular game and it’s in Denver, where they are very tough to beat. I think Denver’s going to win this game and we’ll see what happens in the Super Bowl.”

Seahawks slight favorites over Rams

If the point spread — 2 1/2 points at BetMGM and Caesars in favor of Seattle — is to be believed, the Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams should play another tense game when they meet in the NFC championship game.

They split the regular-season meetings, with the Rams winning 21-19 at home and the Seahawks 38-37 in Seattle. LA blew a 16-point fourth-quarter lead in the rematch before falling in overtime.

Cipollini said three times more betting action has come in on the Seahawks.

“If you do like the Seahawks, right now is the time to get on,” Cipollini said. “Any sharps (professional bettors) that are on the Seahawks are going to want to take them at 2 1/2. Just judging where this number is, if anything, it feels it can possibly get to 3.”

Feazel noted the Rams were favored just a month ago when they played at Seattle.

“Week in, week out, there’s some recency bias that goes into the lines,” Feazel said. “What have you done for me lately and what did we see last week and expect the same thing. That’s what makes the NFL so great.”

Rams with the road advantage?

Lumen Field has provided a notable home-field advantage for the Seahawks.

Even so, the Rams were in position to win the regular-season meeting there, and they won both their playoff games on the road so far this postseason.

The Rams and quarterback Matthew Stafford will attempt to become the sixth team to win three road games in one postseason. The four most recent teams to accomplish that went to win the Super Bowl.

“I almost think the Rams are better off playing on the road,” Marshall said. “Even at home, a lot of times almost half the fans are for the other team. They’re the only team I think can go into Seattle and have a chance against this defense.”

Another test for Darnold

Sam Darnold struggled earlier in his career until a breakout season with Minnesota in 2024, but he now is the only quarterback to lead two different teams to consecutive 14-win seasons.

The eight-year veteran finally earned his first playoff victory Saturday, a 41-6 win over banged-up San Francisco.

NFC title game winner a Super Bowl favorite

BetMGM and Caesars list the Seahawks and Rams as two leading favorites to win the Super Bowl.

Seattle or Los Angeles would be favored by a field goal or more over the Patriots in the big game and by at least 7 1/2 points over the Broncos.

Here are some of the top moments and defining characteristics of the Patriots' Super Bowl legacy, as shared by Redditors:

Super Bowl LI Comeback (28-3 vs. Falcons)

The Patriots' comeback from a 28-3 deficit against the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI is widely considered the greatest in Super Bowl history.

Edelman's Miraculous Catch: A pivotal play that kept the Patriots' drive alive. ""The slowmo of the Edelman catch is always so insane to me"" and ""The Edelman catch was sacred healing.""

Hightower's Sack and James White's Performance: Key defensive and offensive plays that turned the tide. ""Hightower had a similar quote when someone asked him if he was upset he didn’t make the pro bowl. 'We’re in the ring business'"" and ""James White robbed of MVP"".

Falcons' Collapse: Critics point to the Falcons' play-calling as a major factor in their loss. ""Still so mind-blowing that the Falcons could fuck up so badly."" and ""Throwing on 3rd and 1 up 16 with 8 minutes to go in the game was certainly a choice"".

Brady's Leadership: Many believe the comeback was only possible due to Tom Brady's experience and leadership. ""I genuinely don't think this comeback is possible without Brady having such a history of doing this stuff."".

The ""Ring Business"" Mentality

The Patriots organization and its players are often characterized by their focus on winning championships above all else.

Prioritizing Rings over Individual Honors: ""We went to 13 AFC championship games in an 18 year span. It’s easier to reference the 6 rings."" and ""You think I play this shit to go to Probowls?"".

Consistent Success: The Patriots' ability to consistently reach and compete in the Super Bowl is a testament to their organizational strength. ""I had moved to the Boston area a few years prior but have never been a fan of Boston teams... The level of noise I heard in my neighborhood just from the cheering at the end of this game is unmatched."".

Future Prospects

While the Patriots have faced challenges in recent years, there's still hope for future success.

Drake Maye and Future Potential: Some fans believe in the potential of new players to bring the team back to Super Bowl contention. ""Drake Maye is an elite QB and Vrabel is a great coach but the supporting cast isn't top tier."".

The money raised goes directly to the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation dedicated to curing spinal cord injury, the Michael J. Fox Foundation committed to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease and SCIboston's Travis Roy Legacy Grant that assists individuals with paraplegia or quad/tetraplegia caused by spinal cord injury or disorder.

In addition, Tampa-based charitable organizations pdLIFE, which helps patients with Parkinson's disease, and Stay In Step Brain & Spinal Cord Injury Recovery Center will receive funding from the Go Forward! event.

""This is our biggest night,"" NHL Foundation U.S. executive director Rob Wooley said. ""The NHL Foundation has never raised a half a million dollars ever at one time.""

The NHL Foundation will also host the Travis Roy Hockey Classic at Benchmark International Arena in Tampa on Feb. 1, hours before the 2026 Navy Federal Credit Union NHL Stadium Series between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Boston Bruins at Raymond James Stadium, home of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6:30 p.m. ET; ESPN, SN, TVAS).

Players each had to raise at least $5,000 to play in the event, which is expected to raise about $150,000.

""Our work is rooted in a simple belief that hockey has the power to change lives,"" Wooley said. ""Go Forward! is about making sure families facing spinal cord injuries, Parkinson's and long journeys of recovery don't walk those roads alone.

""Tuesday night, this community stepped up in a big way. We're proud to have raised about $600,000 to help fuel research, rehabilitation and support for the organizations doing that work every day. And we're already looking forward to building on that momentum next year.""

As part of the Go Forward! event, the NHL Foundation presented awards to Josh Pauls, a four-time U.S. Paralympic gold medalist in sled hockey, and Lee and Brenda Roy, parents of the late Travis Roy, a forward who sustained a spinal cord injury 11 seconds into his first shift of his debut with Boston University on Oct. 20, 1995, that left him paralyzed from the neck down.

Pauls received the NHL Foundation U.S. Athlete Leadership Award. The Roys received the NHL Foundation U.S. Advocacy Impact Award.

""This is our first truly large fundraising event, and we couldn't be more proud to be honoring such amazing organizations,"" said Kim Davis, the NHL Foundation U.S. president and NHL senior executive vice president of social impact, growth initiatives and legislative affairs. ""The NHL Foundation is really about using the sport of hockey to help build strong and more vibrant communities and the work that we do is never done alone. It's done because of the people in the room tonight. Our ability to be able to do this comes as a result of the work that's done on the ice, but what we do off the ice is just as important.

In attendance were NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly, Hockey Hall of Famers Cam Neely and Brendan Shanahan, 1980 United States Olympic gold medalists Rob McClanahan and Buzz Schneider, former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason, and several retired NHL players.

Their first injury report of the week also listed their top three left tackles -- Charles Cross, Josh Jones and Amari Kight -- as nonparticipants.
Cross -- Seattle's starting left tackle who just signed a four-year, $104.4 million extension -- left in the third quarter Saturday with a foot injury.
""Really good team, really good defense, really good scheme,"" Darnold said.
We've just got to have a really good week of practice.","RENTON, Wash. -- Seattle Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said Sam Darnold ""continues to get better"" but that the quarterback's throwing will be limited this week as he manages an oblique injury ahead of the NFC Championship Game on Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams.

""He's not going to be a full-go the whole week, so we have a plan; we're going to work through it, see how the day goes and then we'll kind of take it day by day and take it to tomorrow,"" Macdonald said Wednesday. ""But he won't be throwing every ball every play for the whole week, no.""

The Seahawks listed Darnold as a limited participant Wednesday. Their first injury report of the week also listed their top three left tackles -- Charles Cross, Josh Jones and Amari Kight -- as nonparticipants.

Darnold suffered the injury to his left oblique in practice Thursday and played through it Saturday against the San Francisco 49ers, completing 12 of 17 attempts for 124 yards, a touchdown and zero turnovers. He was pulled with over nine minutes remaining in the fourth quarter with the top-seeded Seahawks on their way to a 41-6 win in the divisional round.

Darnold said Wednesday he ""felt good"" a day after that game and that he was ""feeling really good"" three days later as the Seahawks began preparations to host the Rams in their third meeting of the season against their NFC West rivals.

""Just attacking rehab these last couple days,"" he said. ""Obviously will be throughout the week. ... I've just got to continue to prepare and get my body right for Sunday.""

Cross -- Seattle's starting left tackle who just signed a four-year, $104.4 million extension -- left in the third quarter Saturday with a foot injury. He missed the final three regular-season games with a hamstring injury and also hurt a knee in practice leading up to the divisional round game against the 49ers.

Seattle's Wednesday injury report listed a foot ailment for Cross as the reason he didn't practice. Jones missed the 49ers game because of knee and ankle injuries he played through in Week 18 while filling in for Cross. Kight, an undrafted rookie, replaced Cross on Saturday but is now listed as having a knee injury.

Logan Brown, another undrafted rookie, is Seattle's No. 4 left tackle.

Macdonald announced Monday that the Seahawks will be without Zach Charbonnet for the remainder of their playoff run after the third-year running back suffered a significant knee injury against the 49ers. Charbonnet, one half of Seattle's two-man rushing attack along with Kenneth Walker III, will need surgery.

The Seahawks on Wednesday designated George Holani to return to practice. He began the season as Seattle's third running back but has been on injured reserve since hurting a hamstring in Week 12.

Seattle's other backup tailbacks are Velus Jones Jr. and former Ram Cam Akers, who won Super Bowl LVI with Los Angeles.

Holani was a full participant Wednesday. Macdonald answered in the affirmative when asked if it's realistic that he could play Sunday.

""Yeah, George is in great shape,"" he said. ""Working his tail off. Excited to get him out there. Haven't seen him practice in a minute, so it'll be fun.""

The Seahawks are 2.5-point favorites in the NFC Championship Game.

They lost the first meeting 21-19 at SoFi Stadium in November, missing a 61-yard field goal that would have won the game despite four Darnold interceptions. The Seahawks came from behind to beat Los Angeles 38-37 in an overtime thriller at Lumen Field in Week 16, as Darnold shook off two more interceptions to help rally Seattle from a 16-point deficit in the fourth quarter.

""Really good team, really good defense, really good scheme,"" Darnold said. ""Good players. So like always, we're really excited about this opportunity to play these guys. We've just got to have a really good week of practice. For me, I've got to continue to attack all the things that I need to attack, just get ready to play these guys, but also just getting my body right to be ready for Sunday.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0116%2Fr1601609_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-22 00:42:17.006051

As Patriots coach Mike Vrabel announced earlier in the day, cornerback Carlton Davis, who is currently in concussion protocol from the injury he suffered in last week's divisional playoff game, practiced in a limited capacity.

The fact that Davis was already on the field in a red non-contact jersey bodes well for his chances of playing on Sunday. It means he's further along in the concussion protocol with a real shot at being available for the road trip to Denver.

There's hope that wide receiver Mack Hollins will be available as well. He is currently dealing with an abdominal injury that has kept him sidelined since the Patriots' Week 16 meeting with the Baltimore Ravens. Vrabel announced that the team wasn't going to open the injured reserve window for Hollins on Wednesday.

Read Nix's complete Instagram post below:","Broncos quarterback Bo Nix took to social media on Wednesday to thank fans for all the support he's been getting since he was injured at the end of the Saturday's divisional playoff win in Denver. It was the first time he's made any type of public comment about his injury since the 33-30 overtime win at Mile High.

Nix was scheduled to undergo surgery a day before for a broken bone in his ankle. In his Instagram post, he thanked his doctor in Alabama who performed the operation.

""Thank you all for the kind words, love and support over the last few days. Thankful for my trainers, Beau, Vince and Dr. Waldrop for taking great care of me,"" Nix wrote.

Nix could be seen on CBS's broadcast walking around on the sideline after getting hurt on one of the final plays. Dr. Landon Fine, an orthopedic surgeon at AdventHealth Parker, said that's not surprising.

""Immediately it hurts to break a bone, obviously. Initially he was able to walk around. But once the swelling and the bleeding and things do what they do, it becomes more symptomatic,"" Fine said.

Nix also wrote about his religious beliefs and how they're guiding him through his recovery, saying ""God never says oops."" He said he believes God has ""big plans for this team.""

Jarrett Stidham will be starting at QB for Denver in the AFC Championship this weekend, and Nix had words of encouragement for his teammate who will now be leading the huddle.

""I couldn't be more confident in Jarrett,"" he wrote.

So far there's no announced timeline for when Nix will be able to begin practicing again for the team, but Fine said that he expects ""after a couple months he'll be back out there.""

The substation (which is operated by Silicon Valley Power) expanded in 2014 with the opening of Levi's Stadium.
The theory was mentioned by receiver Kendrick Bourne after tight end George Kittle tore his right Achilles during the 49ers' wild card playoff win over the Philadelphia Eagles.
And while the theory has been debunked by scientists and other medial professionals, the 49ers aren't taking anything to chance.
Despite those and other injuries, the 49ers went 12-5 during the regular season while playing in the NFL's toughest division.","After having another promising season derailed by injury, the San Francisco 49ers will evaluate everything this offseason, including looking into whether or not excessive exposure to electromagnetic force (EMF) is contributing to the team's alarming injury rate.

Specifically, 49ers general manager John Lynch said the team will investigate a viral conspiracy theory that the electrical substation near their training facility and Levi's Stadium is having an impact on the team's injuries. The substation (which is operated by Silicon Valley Power) expanded in 2014 with the opening of Levi's Stadium.

The theory was mentioned by receiver Kendrick Bourne after tight end George Kittle tore his right Achilles during the 49ers' wild card playoff win over the Philadelphia Eagles. And while the theory has been debunked by scientists and other medial professionals, the 49ers aren't taking anything to chance.

""We've been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see, does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means? That's what we know exists,"" 49ers general manager John Lynch said, via ESPN. ""We've heard that debunked. ... The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We pore into it. Our ownership, Jed [York] is tremendous in terms of resources and we'll always be cognizant of things. I know that a lot of games have been won at this facility since it opened, but yeah, we aren't going to turn a blind eye.""

Given their injury numbers in recent years, it's easy to see why the 49ers will at least do their due diligence to look into this theory. This season, the 49ers dealt with significant injuries to several key players, including Kittle, pass rusher Nick Bosa (torn ACL), linebacker Fred Warner (fractured and dislocated ankle), quarterback Brock Purdy (turf toe) and rookie pass rusher Mykel Williams (torn ACL).

Despite those and other injuries, the 49ers went 12-5 during the regular season while playing in the NFL's toughest division. But if the 49ers want to win their first Super Bowl since 1994, they're going to have to find a way to get more of their players to the finish line.

With that in mind, Lynch said the 49ers will look over their entire process this offseason in an effort to have a healthier team moving forward.

""The fact of the matter is injuries are a part of this game,"" Lynch said. ""What we strive to do is never to eliminate injuries, but to mitigate injuries. And I think we have a lot of good processes. We'll challenge them all. And that process has begun. It never frankly stopped. But yes, we'll look at everything and we'll examine everything.""",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/21/c001b6f3-c0b5-46fa-8007-35bdf8224ace/thumbnail/1200x675/a21b98472007b6e0e74f13252532f158/kittlehurt.png,N,,2026-01-22 00:42:31.801687

Linebackers Harold Landry III and Marte Mapu stayed sidelined during Wednesday’s practice inside the WIN Waste Innovations Field House. But a handful were limited as sights set on the Denver Broncos, including cornerback Carlton Davis III, who entered the NFL’s concussion protocol late in the divisional round.

Here’s the first injury report ahead of Sunday’s 3 p.m. ET kickoff at Empower Field.

Landry has been managing a knee injury since the midway mark in the regular season. The defensive captain and sack leader began the week of the divisional round with back-to-back limited practices before sitting out on Friday and earning a questionable game status. He saw 11 out of 75 defensive snaps from there against the Houston Texans. As for Mapu, the core linebacker handled 58 percent of the workload on special teams in the 28-16 win at Gillette Stadium.

Officially among five partial participants in Foxborough, Davis headed to the locker room and was ruled out in the closing minutes last Sunday. The veteran corner turned in four tackles, including one for loss, along with two interceptions and two pass breakups before then. He is trending in the right direction ahead of the matchup with a new starting quarterback at Mile High.

A week after opening Jennings’ 21-day activation window, the Patriots opened Farmer’s. The rookie defensive tackle sustained a hamstring injury in December and was a full participant in his first practice back.

The Broncos head coach sung the praises of backup Jarrett Stidham Wednesday as Denver prepares to face the New England Patriots. In fact, he expects Stidham to ""rip it"" against an aggressive Patriots defense that's given C.J. Stroud and Justin Herbert fits in the first two rounds of the playoffs.

“That's his personality. He’s going to rip it,"" Payton told reporters of Stidham. ""He has a calm demeanor that suits him well.""

In fact, Payton says he believes that Stidham is a starting-level NFL quarterback.

""I felt like our two [QBs] were inside the best 32,"" Payton said, per Troy Renck of the Denver Post. ""I am glad that acquisition took place.”

If Stidham is a top-32 quarterback, Payton knows something that the rest of the league doesn't. Stidham is a career backup who hasn't thrown a pass since the 2023 season.

It's not all bad news for the Broncos

The good news for the Broncos is that Stidham won't be going in completely cold. Stidham joined the Broncos as a free agent in 2023, Payton's first season as Denver's head coach. He's been practicing in Payton's system for three seasons.

The Broncos will be counting on that familiarity and comfort level with the Denver offense against a Patriots defense that sacked Herbert six times in the wild-card round and intercepted Stroud four times last week in the divisional round.

It would be a daunting task for Nix, much less a quarterback in Stidham who's made four career NFL starts. And practice experience, obviously, doesn't equate to a playoff atmosphere with a trip to the Super Bowl at stake.

Stidham: It's just another game

Stidham said on Wednesday that he's taking the approach that it's just another game.

""What I always go back to — in any game — regular season, preseason, AFC championship — it’s still the same game,"" Stidham told reporters. ""Obviously there’s implications — winner advances, and all that kind of stuff. But at the end of the day, it’s still football. And that’s how I view it.

""I’m not treating it any differently. I’m not treating my preparation any differently. I’m just gonna go out there and play and be myself.""

He sounds confident. And that's certainly what you want to hear if you're Payton or a Broncos fan.

Broncos are built to win without elite QB play

The Broncos have a team that doesn't depend on high-level quarterback play to win. Denver earned the AFC's No. 1 seed on the strength of a defense that finished second in yards allowed and third in points allowed (18.3 per game) this season.

The offense was no slouch and finished in the top half of the league in yards and points per game (23.6). But the Broncos neither depended on nor received elite quarterback play from Nix.

Nix's passer rating (87.8) was below league average (91.4) and ranked 27th among quarterbacks who started eight games or more. His completion percentage (63.4%) and yards per attempt (6.43) both took a slight dip from his rookie campaign as he threw for 25 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.

Nix's best attribute, arguably, was his play late in close games. Thanks in part to not having an offense that pulled away from opponents, the Broncos found themselves repeatedly in tight games in the fourth quarter. More often than not, Nix found a way to make the plays the Broncos needed in those situations, including a late go-ahead touchdown pass against the Bills last week that ultimately forced overtime in Denver's 33-30 divisional round win.

Nix addressed that finish and his confidence in Stidham Wednesday in an Instagram post that included his first public comments since learning of the season-ending ankle injury he sustained at the end of the win over Buffalo.

“This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it,” Nix wrote. “I can’t express how much this team and organization mean to me and how much I believe in them.

""I couldn’t be more proud of our guys. I couldn’t be more confident in Jarrett. And I couldn’t be more excited for what’s next.”

Confidence exudes from the Broncos' practice facility despite Nix's injury. But what ultimately matters is what that confidence looks like when the whistle blows on Sunday.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ynqBYYBxiLX8xpzuSWWqOA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MTQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/c3c92ce0-f4d8-11f0-a3df-5966d2ace387,N,,2026-01-22 00:42:45.125392

None of Seattle’s top three options at left tackle – starter Charles Cross and reserves Josh Jones and Amari Kight – participated in practice Wednesday due to injury concerns.

There’s an area of Rams’ offense Seattle Seahawks can exploit

Cross returned for last week’s divisional round win over the San Francisco 49ers after missing the final three games of the regular season with a hamstring injury, but a knee issue was added to the injury report last week. Now he’s dealing with a foot injury.

Jones was out all of last week and missed the 49ers game with a knee injury. On Wednesday’s practice report, he was listed with both knee and ankle injuries. Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald had said earlier Wednesday that Jones was not expected to practice.

Kight, an undrafted rookie from Alabama and Central Florida, has a knee injury. He played well in 17 offensive snaps and seven special teams snaps last weekend.

The Seahawks had a whopping 14 players on Wednesday’s injury report, though three were limited for rest reasons – linebacker Demarcus Lawrence, wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and defensive end Leonard Williams.

Quarterback Sam Darnold remained limited in practice with an oblique injury that he first encountered last week in practice. The other limited players were guard Bryce Cabeldue (knee), linebacker Uchenna Nwosu (hamstring) and fullback Robbie Ouzts (neck).

Injury Updates: How Seahawks will handle Darnold this week

The best news for Seattle is that running back George Holani was a full participant in his first practice after being designated to return from injured reserve earlier in the day from a hamstring injury. The Seahawks no doubt would like to see Holani, their typical No. 3 RB, return this week following No. 2 RB Zach Charbonnet’s season-ending ACL tear suffered against the 49ers.

Other Seahawks listed as full participants were linebacker Tyrice Knight (knee), tight end Elijah Arroyo (knee) and linebacker Chazz Surratt (ankle). Arroyo and Surratt were both designated to return from IR in the past two weeks but have yet to be activated back onto the active roster.

The Rams’ injury report was a fraction in size of Seattle’s on Wednesday with just four players listed. Safety Quentin Lake (illness) and linebacker Byron Young (knee) did not participate, cornerback Emmanuel Forbes (shoulder) was limited, and linebacker Josaiah Stewart (knee) was a full participant.

Sunday’s NFC Championship at Seattle’s Lumen Field is set for a 3:30 p.m. kickoff, with radio coverage on Seattle Sports beginning at 12:30 with the pregame show.

After rushing for 1,016 yards and earning Pro Bowl honors for the second time in his career in 2024, Joe Mixon landed on the non-football injury list before 2025 kicked off. His roster designation did not change throughout the regular season or postseason.

""We haven't seen Joe in a little bit, so I think at some point we'll see him and then we'll be able to evaluate kind of where he is and then based on information, we'll see where his status is,"" Caserio said.

During last year's training camp, the Texans announced Mixon sustained a foot injury away from the facility in the offseason. The team was largely mum on the details of the running back's recovery throughout the season.

Caserio gave a partial explanation Wednesday, stopping short of revealing the injury.

PATRIOTS RETURN TO AFC CHAMPIONSHIP AFTER FORCING 5 TEXANS TURNOVERS IN HEAVY WINTRY MIX

""It wasn't like he was riding a snowmobile or anything like that,"" Caserio said. ""It was more of a medical condition or situation that never ... really didn't improve maybe as much as everybody would have hoped. I'm not trying to evade the question, that's the reality of the situation. He didn't jump off a building. He wasn't cliff diving or anything. He wasn't doing anything irresponsible. It was just a freak thing.""

The Texans reached the divisional round of the NFL playoffs for a third straight season, but five turnovers against the New England Patriots ultimately ended Houston's hopes of advancing to the AFC Championship.

The Texans’ offense took a noticeable hit with Mixon out all season due to the injury. Mixon has one year remaining on a three-year, $27 million contract extension he signed after joining the Texans following seven years with the Cincinnati Bengals.

Caserio said they were not sure of his status throughout the season but held out hope that he could return at some point.

""It was a very unique situation,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody really had any clarity, honestly, from the start of the year until now. I'd say Joe worked very, very hard to try to get himself ready to play football, it just never manifested itself, came to fruition. So probably have an opportunity to kind of see where he is in the offseason relative to next year.""

With Mixon out this season, the Texans relied on rookie Woody Marks and veteran running back Nick Chubb. Marks, a fourth-round pick, led the team with 703 yards rushing and Chubb added 506 yards.

When asked specifically if they believe Mixon's condition will improve enough for him to be ready for the start of training camp, Caserio said it's too soon to tell.

""We'll see. Believe me, I'm not smart enough to be a doctor so I'm going to leave that up to the medical experts,"" he said. ""Once we ... get a little bit more clarity, more information, we'll kind of see where we are.""

Thank you all for the kind words, love and support over the last few days. Thankful for my trainers, Beau, Vince and Dr. Waldrop for taking great care of me.

God never says oops, and he is always good. He has big plans for this team. We're not finished, as a matter of fact we're just getting started. We're just going to keep climbing higher.

Go Broncos.

Nix's injury halted what would have been an intriguing showdown between two of the league's rising young quarterbacks with Patriots quarterback Drake Maye on the other sideline.

Members of the 2024 NFL Draft class, Maye and Nix have enjoyed fast starts to their careers. Nix helped the Broncos snap their 10-year drought without a playoff appearance as a rookie. This past Sunday, he led Denver to its first postseason victory since its win over the Carolina Panthers in Super Bowl 50.

While his team didn't have much success in 2024, Maye did earn Pro Bowl honors after completing an impressive 66.6% of his passes. This year, he led the NFL with a 72% completion percentage while leading the Patriots to their first 14-win season since 2016.

While Nix and Maye won't get the chance to match wits on Sunday, there is another point of intrigue in Stidham trying to join the surprisingly long list of backup quarterbacks who have led their teams to the big game. That list includes Jeff Hostetler, the former New York Giants quarterback who helped Bill Parcells win his fourth Super Bowl with Big Blue.

Broncos coach Sean Payton -- a Parcells disciple -- is hoping to emulate his former boss by becoming the latest coach to win it all with a backup quarterback.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/21/f79bb6d2-54e5-4904-9a98-f7fa7f88fbbc/thumbnail/1200x675/2c9d161012a65ee6d9fd8acdc5ee4fdd/bonix.png,N,,2026-01-21 20:00:38.900953

The 49ers have trained in Santa Clara since the late 1980s with the substation coming in a few years later.
Still, the 49ers' injury issues over the past decade or so are robust enough to take nothing off the table.
According to Lynch, the 49ers will do a deep dive into their entire process for injuries beyond conspiracy theories.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- After yet another injury-plagued season, the San Francisco 49ers intend to investigate every avenue to find out why those ailments continue to pile up year after year.

That includes an investigation into the viral conspiracy theory that the electrical substation near their training facility and Levi's Stadium is contributing to those injuries, general manager John Lynch said Wednesday.

""Because it deals with allegedly the health and safety of our players, I think you have to look into everything,"" Lynch said. ""We've been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see, does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means? That's what we know exists. We've heard that debunked. ... The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We pore into it. Our ownership, Jed [York] is tremendous in terms of resources and we'll always be cognizant of things. I know that a lot of games have been won at this facility since it opened, but yeah, we aren't going to turn a blind eye.""

The theory that has been making the rounds on the internet and has crept its way into the 49ers locker room -- receiver Kendrick Bourne alluded to it after tight end George Kittle tore his right Achilles in the playoff game against Philadelphia -- suggests the Niners' lengthy injury list over the past decade-plus can be attributed, in part, to excessive exposure to electromotive force (EMF).

The 49ers have trained in Santa Clara since the late 1980s with the substation coming in a few years later. The station, which is operated by Silicon Valley Power, expanded in 2014 in conjunction with the opening of Levi's Stadium.

The theory has been shot down by various scientists and medical professionals. Frank de Vocht, a professor of epidemiology and public health at Bristol Medical School in England, is considered a leading expert on how EMF affects humans and told The Washington Post that the theory is ""nonsense.""

Still, the 49ers' injury issues over the past decade or so are robust enough to take nothing off the table. This season, San Francisco lost three of its best players -- defensive end Nick Bosa (torn ACL), linebacker Fred Warner (broken ankle) and Kittle (Achilles) -- to season-ending injuries. First-round pick Mykel Williams (torn ACL) also missed a big chunk of the season.

There also were lengthy absences for quarterback Brock Purdy (turf toe variant), receivers Ricky Pearsall (sprained knee and ankle) and Jauan Jennings (rib, shoulder and ankle) and linebacker Tatum Bethune (groin).

According to OverTheCap, the 49ers had 20 players on a reserve list this season, accounting for more than $95 million in adjusted annual value on their contracts, the highest amount in the league by nearly $20 million over second-place Arizona.

That comes on the heels of a 2024 season in which the Niners led the league in adjusted games lost (141.2), a number that estimates the impact of injuries on teams. They also led the league in that category in 2020 (not including COVID).

""We're always looking into trends, data, everything we do,"" Lynch said. ""Our health and performance of our players is at the utmost priority each and every year. This year it was tough and it took a toll on our team and we'll continue to look. ... We've spent a lot of time and effort in recruiting really quality people. And I think being at the forefront of injury prevention and I think this year, probably because the star players that went down, there was a lot of attention given on that.""

On the injury front, Lynch and coach Kyle Shanahan indicated that Bosa and Williams will have a chance to be back around the start of training camp or early into it. Warner should be good to go for the start of the offseason program, and Kittle is expected back during the season.

Rookie linebacker Nick Martin cleared concussion protocol Wednesday morning for a concussion he suffered Nov. 30, and tight end Jake Tonges suffered a plantar fascia injury against Seattle that will keep him out about three weeks.

Defensive tackle Alfred Collins might also need surgery on a shoulder injury suffered last week against Seattle, Shanahan said.

According to Lynch, the 49ers will do a deep dive into their entire process for injuries beyond conspiracy theories.

""The fact of the matter is injuries are a part of this game,"" Lynch said. ""What we strive to do is never to eliminate injuries, but to mitigate injuries. And I think we have a lot of good processes. We'll challenge them all. And that process has begun. It never frankly stopped. But yes, we'll look at everything and we'll examine everything.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0121%2Fr1603813_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 19:01:40.652431

The New England Patriots are one of the NFL’s best teams once again. Mike Vrabel immediately brought the Patriots back to glory, leading them to an AFC Championship game in his first season as head coach. Now the Patriots are gearing up for their most important game in several years. The team received a mixed bag of injury updates before this weekend’s game against the Broncos.

Vrabel said that cornerback Carlton Davis III is expected back at practice on a limited basis, per ESPN’s Mike Reiss.

Davis suffered a concussion against the Texans during the Divisional Round. He played well in that game, logging four tackles and snagging two huge interceptions.

It is a good sign that Davis should practice at all on Wednesday. However, the NFL’s concussion protocol is a multi-step process. It is simply too early to tell whether he’ll be cleared to play on Sunday.

Meanwhile, Vrabel also said that veteran receiver Mack Hollins will not start practicing on Wednesday.

Hollins suffered an abdomen injury in late December and was placed on injured reserve. He has missed New England’s last four games.

The fact that Hollins has not yet return to practice suggests he may not play in the AFC Championship. Even if he ends up getting activated, it would be unlikely that he has a large role in the offense after practicing so little this week.

But getting Hollins back would be a big emotional boost for the team. Patriots receivers Stefon Diggs and Kayshon Boutte explained after the Divisional Round that they were inspired by Hollins’ eventual return.

“We said one more game before we get Mack back,” said Boutte, per Mark Daniels of MassLive on X, formerly Twitter.

Both players did just enough against Houston to keep New England’s offense humming. But the challenge will be quite different against Denver this weekend.

Many expected Mack Hollins to return to practice today, but Mike Vrabel announced that it will not be the case. Hollins has spent four weeks on the injured reserve and is eligible to return for Sunday’s game.

“That won’t happen today,” Vrabel said when asked if the Patriots would be activating Hollins.

The move could come later in the week. However, the fact that the Patriots are not opening his practice window casts doubt on his availability for Sunday. The Denver Broncos have a great defense, and having Hollins on the field will go a long way.

If Hollins’ practice window is opened on Thursday, he would have just three days to show he’s ready to return from injured reserve. He was placed on injured reserve with an abdominal injury after the Patriots game against the Baltimore Ravens.

Before his injury, he had played 68% of offensive snaps, which was the most among Patriots receivers at the time. He was third on the team in receiving yards and receptions before landing on injured reserve.

At 6-foot-4, 221 pounds, Hollin’s presence downfield and in the run game was a huge part of the Patriots’ offense. They do not have another receiver with his build and skillset. Kayshon Boutte and Stefon Diggs were , but will have to wait to see him return to practice.

“It would mean a lot,” Boutte said about getting Hollins back, per MassLive’s Mark Daniels on Monday. “Even before this game, that was the message to our receivers. Me and Diggs come out before the game and talk together when we come out of the tunnel for warmups and said, ‘One more game, and we get Mack back.’ I think it would mean a lot to Mack.

One of the challenges for their defense entering next season will be improving their pass rush.

And for their defensive ends to be healthy.

One of the leaders of that group, defensive end Greg Rousseau, spoke to the media during the locker cleanout on Sunday and revealed something previously unknown.

The edge professed that he was injured during the first game of the season and played through it.

I started the season off, I kind of hurt my knee versus Baltimore,” Rousseau said when asked about his individual play and how it ramped up near the end of the year.

“But then when I got healthier towards the middle end of the season, I feel like I started playing some real good ball, especially heading into the playoffs, getting to the quarterback, hitting the quarterback. Just trying to help the team win. I feel like I try my best, and obviously, there's always room to grow. So I'll be excited for the opportunity next year to keep on getting better and keep on helping the team win.”

The 2021 first-round pick out of Miami had more recently been practicing in a limited capacity throughout the week, going into the Bills' Division Round playoff matchup with the Denver Broncos. This after a strong outing in Buffalo's Wild Card round win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, finishing with six total tackles, 1 sack, and one pass defensed over 44 defensive snaps.

He started opposite veteran Joey Bosa this season, forming a formidable duo until Bosa's play plateaued late in the season after missing time with a hamstring injury himself in Week 14.

""It's tough. It's part of the game,"" he added. ""You could put together a roster at the beginning of the season, and then like fast forward 20 weeks, it's not the same. There are a lot of injuries, a lot of things happen in football. It's a violent game.""

It's unknown yet if Bosa will resign with the Bills this offseason, but Rousseau acknowledged that their teammates stepped up do their part to help the team compete.

""A lot of dudes stepped up. A lot of dudes really embraced it, and nobody was scared of the moment. Everybody stepped up to the plate and tried their best.""","https://billswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/12/SNET/88138921007-usatsi-27984984.jpg?crop=3926,2209,x0,y204&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 17:03:38.166960

Come late November, the Texans effectively closed the door on Mixon suiting up at any point in 2025.
""It was a very unique situation,"" Caseiro said.

General manager Nick Caseiro said Wednesday that Mixon has not been at the team facility in some time. The Texans are unable to make a decision on his future until medical personnel gather more information.

Mixon missed OTAs and minicamp with what was believed to be an ankle injury. He was then feared to miss an extended period of time when the Texans placed him on the non-football injury list on July 23. His transfer to the reserve NFI list ruled him out for the first four games of the season, and Caseiro said after that period that while Mixon was progressing, he still needed at least another month before making a decision on his availability.

Come late November, the Texans effectively closed the door on Mixon suiting up at any point in 2025.

""It was a very unique situation,"" Caseiro said. ""I don't think anybody really had any clarity, honestly, from the start of the year until now. I'd say Joe worked very, very hard to try to get himself ready to play football. It just never manifested itself and came to fruition.

""Probably have an opportunity to kind of see where he is in the offseason relative to next year. But, again, it was as unique a situation and injury as I've been associated with. I don't want to call it a freak thing, but it's just kind of a freak thing. Joe worked really hard, put his best foot forward, but it didn't work out.""

The Texans have been coy about Mixon's status from the jump, which Caseiro chalked up to there being a lack of clarity regarding the injury itself. Houston's GM did shed more light on the situation this week, though, referring to the issue as a medical condition.

""He didn't do anything off the field,"" Caseiro said. ""It wasn't like he was riding a snowmobile or anything like that. I'd say it was just more of a medical condition or situation that really didn't improve maybe as much as everybody would have hoped. I'm not trying to evade the question. I think that's the reality of the situation. He didn't jump off a building. He wasn't cliff diving or anything like that.

""He wasn't doing anything irresponsible. It was a freak thing. Honestly, I've never seen it, the condition.""

A stellar debut season in Houston set Mixon up for what most believed would be a highly productive 2025 campaign. He earned his second career Pro Bowl nod in 2024 after rushing for 1,016 yards and 11 touchdowns and shining in a pair of playoff games. Instead, the Texans leaned on Woody Marks and Nick Chubb, who combined for just five rushing scores.

“We’ll see. Believe me, I’m not smart enough to be a doctor so I’m going to leave that up to the medical experts,” he said. “Once we… get a little bit more clarity, more information, we’ll kind of see where we are.”

Mixon has rushed for 7,428 yards and 60 touchdowns in 111 career games (102 starts) with the Cincinnati Bengals (2017-23) and Texans. He has 319 catches for 2,448 yards and 14 scores.

The Texans finished 12-5 without Mixon and earned their third straight trip to the playoffs. Rookie Woody Marks led the team with 703 rushing yards and veteran Nick Chubb added 506 yards on the ground.

Among the topics discussed were injury updates on two starters, cornerback Carlton Davis and wide receiver Mack Hollins.

According to Vrabel, only one of the two will be present at the first practice of the week.

After catching a pair of interceptions in the first half of the Patriots’ divisional round game against the Houston Texans, Davis exited in the fourth quarter with what was later announced as a head injury. Originally deemed questionable to return, he was eventually ruled out before the two-minute warning.

According to Vrabel, Davis has since been placed in the NFL’s concussion protocol. Nonetheless, the belief is that he will be able to practice on Wednesday.

“I would anticipate him being out there, probably in a limited capacity,” said Vrabel. “But just working his way through protocol.”

Davis is one of the Patriots’ starting cornerbacks, lining up on the perimeter opposite Pro Bowler Christian Gonzalez. Ranked second on the team in defensive snaps this season, he was replaced by backup Charles Woods after his departure.

One of the Patriots’ starting receivers, Hollins caught 46 passes for 550 yards and a pair of touchdowns over the Patriots’ first 15 games of the regular season. However, and an abdomen injury forced the team to place him on injured reserve on Dec. 27, ahead of New England’s Week 17 contest against the New York Jets.

While eligible to return to practice this week, the free agency pickup has not yet been cleared to return to action.

“That won’t happen today, no,” said Vrabel.

Without Hollins, the Patriots gave increased opportunities to rookie receivers Kyle Williams and Efton Chism. The two youngsters finished last week’s game against the Texans ranked third and fourth among their position group in snaps, although neither was able to haul in a pass.

Hollins’ next opportunities to return to practice will come on Thursday and Friday; the Patriots will then travel to Denver on Saturday, at which point a decision about his return to the 53-man roster will have to be made.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2257293162.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=3.0595520019531%2C3.3498935183544%2C96.940447998047%2C76.137139785078&w=1200,N,,2026-01-21 16:01:11.511982

As with the previous piece, this isn’t only a “dang, that stinks” reaction. It’s a way to examine unexpected results to learn and improve. Interestingly, and not all too surprisingly, a lot of the receiving hits and misses hinged on the performances of their quarterbacks.

Wide receivers

Underperformers

Brian Thomas, JAX: To be fair to Thomas, starting the season with a wrist injury disappointed managers from the beginning. Many — including me — expected at least the same, if not better, success with Trevor Lawrence (vs. Mac Jones). Unfortunately, Thomas’ talent couldn’t bridge the rapport gap, and 2025 was worse. When Thomas was 100%, we saw flashes of his rookie season and upside, but never the consistent dominance — partially due to Lawrence’s comfort level throwing to his slot options.

He’s targeted the slot at a 32.5% rate since entering the NFL — ninth among 70 QBs with at least 250 attempts and fourth among full-time starters during that span (behind Lamar Jackson, Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes). Thomas dropped from a 26.9 Slot% mark to 21.4 this season, with first Travis Hunter, then Parker Washington, being the ones lining up in the slot the most. We saw how good Washington was at the end of the year, further proof of Lawrence’s comfort with those quick-decision throws to the slot.

Additionally, the arrival of Jakobi Meyers had Thomas being used as the downfield option all too often. Thomas saw a small jump from 11.6 AirYD/TGT to 12.9 this year, but once Meyers arrived, it rocketed to 17.6. That also came with just 5.2 targets per game, down from 7.8 last year.

The first part of the equation is actionable in terms of effectiveness with a different quarterback … but we knew that. A better quarterback doesn’t always mean a stock boost for everyone. The second part is deeper: Having this information on Lawrence’s slot reliance should have made managers abandon ship, even trading Thomas for a major discount on draft cost, once the Meyers trade happened, since there was no way it could get better.

Xavier Worthy, KC: Easily one of my biggest misses, as Worthy didn’t provide WR2 value, but couldn’t before even Rashee Rice’s return. Even factoring in the Week 1 injury, Worthy had just 14.6, 8.1 and 9.6 points, respectively, in Weeks 4-6, and zero double-digit games after his 14.6 showing, including just a 5.7 FPPG mark after Rice’s return — 57th among qualified WRs.

Sure, Patrick Mahomes missed the final three weeks, but Worthy was already on Bust Boulevard before that. Simply put, projecting Worthy to continue most of his late-2024 success was wrong. It’s not that we were purely chasing those final three games of last season, as Worthy had five double-digit scores before that and three more over 7.0 points.

The reason for the miss? Similar to Thomas, Worthy’s usage changed. He saw more downfield targets, which are inherently less reliable. Worthy went from a 75.0 Catchable TGT% as a rookie to 66.7%, with a deeper AirYD/TGT mark (12.9, up from 9.2). If the Catchable% doesn’t sound like a major drop, it is, as Worthy was 155th of 170 players with at least 25 routes and targets.

My assumption (and miss) was that Mahomes was too good for Worthy to fail in replacing the aging Travis Kelce as the No. 2 target earner. The targets were there — when healthy — but Worthy didn’t succeed as much downfield, which fell on Mahomes’ shoulders a bit too. Worthy replicating much of what Rice does — but not as well — was the fact not to overlook.

Justin Jefferson, MIN: Speaking of which, how about we don’t overlook just how much of a risk a quarterback can be? Even as someone who tabbed J.J. McCarthy as “J.J. McHeinicke,” I figured Jefferson was way, waayyy, too good to allow subpar QB play to stop him. After all, Jefferson could have retained his WR1 (Top 12) value with Taylor Heinicke under center, as he did with Nick Mullens and “Fugitive” villain (The One-Armed Man) Carson Wentz. It wasn’t only the decrease in targets, as Jefferson averaged 7.6 with McCarthy versus 9.9 the previous four seasons, but also how poor the targets were.

Nearly 20% (19.7) of McCarthy’s throws were off target, leading to a 52.6 Catch% for Jefferson, plus just 1.07 fantasy points per target (FPPT), well below his 1.71 career mark. I also jokingly called Jefferson “QB immune” due to his talent, but he wasn’t: He finished as WR34 in FPPG (min. 10 games) at 9.4. No one would have predicted it to be this bad, but ranking Jefferson as a WR1, let alone pushing the Top 5, did not account for the very real and very terrible QB-influenced floor.

Overperformers

George Pickens, DAL: Many of us expected the same, if not a better, Pickens as the Cowboys’ No. 2 receiving option versus being the top (only?) option with the Steelers in 2024. It turned out to be much better in Dallas. Pickens hit career highs across the board, finishing as WR6 with 14.3 FPPG and WR5 overall. It wasn’t only because CeeDee Lamb missed time either, as Pickens had a near-identical TmTGT% with (22.4) and without (22.8) Lamb on the field. You can toss in YD/REC (15.3 to 15.6), First Down per TGT% (54.4 to 51.1) and red zone target rate (0.71 to 0.53) as numbers that also barely changed. The miss in projections came down to lower REC% and YD/REC, as Dak Prescott’s numbers were actually super close (403-for-607, 4,460 yards, and 31.5 passing touchdowns, compared to 404-for-600, 4,552 and 30). I undersold Pickens’ per-play/target upside, so instead of increasing the volume with a small efficiency downtick, I should have had all of his per-target numbers pointing up … or at least holding steady.

Chris Olave, NO: A midseason QB change and trade of Rashid Shaheed were catalysts for Olave’s career-best campaign. Tyler Shough didn’t make a positive difference because of volume or OnTGT%, as both were better with Spencer Rattler (28.9 TGT% to 25.1 and 7.0 OffTGT% to 16.5). It was AirYD/TGT (9.7 to 13.5) and touchdowns (3 to 6). Shough, having more downfield ability, helped Olave climb from a volume middleman option (like Jarvis Landry of old) to a true all-around threat and Top 10 WR.

The lesson gleaned from Olave’s best season cannot be applied on draft day; rather, it applies in-season. Like when Meyers went to Jacksonville, and Jameson Williams benefited from Dan Campbell taking back offensive playcalling, buying low on Olave (as I suggested and many sent thanks for), given the upside with the change at QB and the addition of Shaheed, was the winning move.

Alec Pierce, IND: Similar to Jefferson in a different direction, no one saw Pierce’s ascendance coming, even if you predicted injury issues with the Colts’ wideouts. Pierce was all about the quarterback situation, which is a major theme here. With Anthony Richardson, Pierce saw 14.6 TGT% with a 44.4 REC% and 1.37 YPRR. With Daniel Jones, Pierce had 19.0%, 56.5% and 2.19, respectively. Those numbers dropped back with Philip Rivers’ ancient arm to 10.5%, 50.0% and 1.07, then rebounded with Riley Leonard to 22.6%, 58.3% and 3.51.

Pierce, like many of the “miss” wide receivers, has a style heavily influenced by his quarterback’s tendencies, abilities and rapport. Remember that not only for Pierce and where he plays next season, but also for any waiver grabs, given the upside or risk factors, if the backup quarterback is significantly different.

Tight ends

Underperformers

Mark Andrews, BAL: If you recall my Travis Etienne breakdown in the RB piece, one of the takeaways was not overrating half of a season. We should factor it in, particularly if it’s injury- or situational-related, but sometimes it’s just a minor factor. Once Andrews “woke up” in 2024, he was TE5 overall and in FPPG with a league-leading 11 touchdowns. Andrews’ targets and yards weren’t too far off from his norm, but the touchdown rate was astronomical. Even including a projected decrease for the 2025 season, Andrews was still pegged for nearly 8 touchdowns.

Due to his decline and quarterback play, Andrews was a major miss. I don’t like injury-related “misses” in general, and the negative impact on Lamar Jackson’s health played a part, but touchdown variance for receiving options can turn a stud into a bust rather easily.

Overperformers

Kyle Pitts, ATL: I didn’t project Pitts for the five touchdowns that kept his career progression on track — 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 from 2021-25 — and I also didn’t project him for enough overall production, even though I was one of the few willing to give him another chance. My line of 100 targets, 63 receptions and 745 yards fell short of his actual 118-88-928 line.

It wasn’t so much QB play with Pitts as it was the Falcons finally using him to his full ability. Instead of asking Pitts to run downfield regularly or work on his routes, they let Pitts use his body, as an NFL power forward of sorts, and man-up defenders to create space and make catches. While we don’t often like to see an AirYD/TGT number go from 10-14 yards to 7.4, there is a similarity to Worthy in that the usage better suited the player.

If you enjoy watching games and players this closely, you likely saw the same and didn’t need me to tell you that the Falcons finally stopped trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. If you’re a more casual fan — and I say that with no disrespect at all — you come to us, including the beat writers and scouts.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/20211257/USATSI_27884638-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-21 18:02:01.698262

New England head coach Mike Vrabel announced that cornerback Carlton Davis III was expected to practice in a limited capacity on Wednesday.

Davis, who was ruled out with a head injury late in Sunday’s divisional round victory over the Houston Texans, is progressing well enough to where he could be eligible to play against the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship.

The NFL’s concussion protocol makes sure that each game is staffed with three unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants, who are primarily responsible for identifying potential head injuries and removing players who exhibit signs of trauma from the game — entering them into the return-to-participation protocol.

Savis is currently in phase four of that protocol, meaning his neurological testing returned to baseline and he is eligible to return to non-contact football activities. If all goes right on Wednesday, he could elevate to phase five and be removed from protocol as early as Friday.

Gonzalez would go on to be listed as a full participant on Thursday and Friday, before making the start against Houston.

Hollins was placed on the NFL’s injured reserve list on Dec. 27, meaning this is the first week he was active to return to practice and to the Patriots’ active roster.

Despite missing two games to end the season, Hollins still finished with the third-most receptions and fourth-most receiving yards — his 550 passing yards were one shy of tying Kayshon Boutte, who also dealt with injury issues late in the season, for third most on the team — in 2025.

The team ranked 15th in the league for rushing in 2024 with Mixon on the team.","The Houston Texans still have no further clarity on Joe Mixon after the running back mysteriously missed the entirety of the 2025 season.

The Texans were rocked just over a month before the start of the season when it was announced that Mixon, 29, had sustained a foot injury.

No other details were divulged at the time other than that the Pro Bowler would miss 'an extended period of time'.

Ultimately, Mixon didn't suit up at all throughout Houston's season, which ended with a playoff defeat to the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round last weekend.

Now, it appears that his future is shrouded in just as much mystery.

Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans had no further update on Mixon's condition when asked if he will play next season.

'I don't know the answer to that right now,' Ryans told reporters on Monday. 'No clarity.'

Ryans also refused to shed any further light on the injury that kept the running back on the non-football injury list throughout 2025.

'He didn't jump off a building,' the coach said. 'He wasn't doing anything irresponsible. It was a freak thing.'

The Texans signed four-time Pro Bowl running back Nick Chubb in free agency in June with the team leaning on him and rookie Woody Marks in Mixon's absence.

'When you have your best players, you're going to be a better team,' Ryans said. 'Joe, he's a really great running back for us and not having him, yes, of course, it affected our running game. Joe is one of the top running backs in this league. That affected us.'

Mixon has one year remaining on his two-year, $19.7 million contract with the Texans, leaving his NFL future in limbo.

Houston missed his contributions this season. The team ranked 15th in the league for rushing in 2024 with Mixon on the team. They dropped to 22nd this past year.

In his first season with the Texans, who acquired him in a trade with the Cincinnati Bengals, he rushed for 1,016 yards and 11 touchdowns.

He has had five 1,000-yard seasons in an eight-year career that started in Cincinnati.",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/21/17/105708519-0-image-m-14_1769015655081.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 16:01:42.115458

“We haven’t seen Joe in a little bit, so I think at some point we’ll see him and then we’ll be able to evaluate kind of where he is and then based on information, we’ll see where his status is,” Caserio said.

The Texans provided few details on the 29-year-old Mixon’s recovery throughout the season after announcing in training camp that he sustained a foot injury away from the facility in the offseason.

Asked for details about his injury Wednesday, Caserio gave a bit more information but still didn’t specify exactly what the injury was.

“It wasn’t like he was riding a snowmobile or anything like that,” Caserio said. “It was more of a medical condition or situation that never… really didn’t improve maybe as much as everybody would have hoped. I’m not trying to evade the question, that’s the reality of the situation. He didn’t jump off a building. He wasn’t cliff diving or anything. He wasn’t doing anything irresponsible. It was just a freak thing.”

The Texans reached the divisional round of the playoffs for a third straight season, but their offense took a major hit with Mixon out all season with the injury. It came after he ran for 1,016 yards and 11 touchdowns in his first season with the team in 2024. He has one year remaining on a three-year, $27 million contract extension he signed after joining the Texans following seven years with the Bengals.

Caserio said they weren’t sure of his status throughout the season but held out hope that he could return at some point.

“It was a very unique situation,” he said. “I don’t think anybody really had any clarity, honestly, from the start of the year until now. I’d say Joe worked very, very hard to try to get himself ready to play football, it just never manifested itself, came to fruition. So probably have an opportunity to kind of see where he is in the offseason relative to next year.”

With Mixon out this season, the Texans relied on rookie Woody Marks and Nick Chubb. Marks, a fourth-round pick, led the team with 703 yards rushing and Chubb added 506 yards. The Texans struggled to run the ball in their loss to New England last week, managing just 48 yards rushing.

When asked specifically if they believe Mixon’s condition will improve enough for him to be ready for the start of training camp, Caserio said it’s too soon to tell.

“We’ll see. Believe me, I’m not smart enough to be a doctor so I’m going to leave that up to the medical experts,” he said. “Once we… get a little bit more clarity, more information, we’ll kind of see where we are.”

After the 2016 season, Golden State added Kevin Durant and he helped them add two more titles to the trophy case.","Mike Dunleavy wore a somber look of resignation as he spoke to the press before the Golden State Warriors hosted the Toronto Raptors on Tuesday night. Less than 24 hours earlier, Jimmy Butler had torn his ACL, effectively ending any last measure of hope for this Warriors season. Dressed in a dapper gray suit jacket and black slacks, the Golden State general manager looked the part of a man readying for a state funeral. Seconds after taking his seat, he began to speak for an organization in peril.

“I don’t have a positive twist on the news,” Dunleavy said. “It’s not good. But this will all come out well in the end and we’ll move forward.”

The situation quickly devolved from bad to worse, as the Raptors routed the Warriors, 145-127. Without the threat of a secondary scoring option, Toronto was able to blitz Stephen Curry, often relegating him to the wing as it built a 30-point lead in the third quarter. The performance laid bare the Warriors’ grim reality as they stare down the February trade deadline, the remainder of the season, and the final years of Curry’s career.

Last February, on the eve of the trade deadline, Dunleavy engineered a trade for and signed him to a two-year extension, hoping to breathe new life into Curry’s career twilight. It worked. Butler meshed immediately with Curry and Draymond Green, and the Warriors went 23-7 with Butler in the lineup down the stretch. They finished seventh in the Western Conference, advanced through the play-in and past the 2-seed Houston Rockets in the first round, and eventually lost in the second round of the playoffs—a series Curry missed after suffering a hamstring strain in Game 1.

This season started slow and uneven, but over the past month, Butler and the Warriors were playing their finest basketball of the year. Prior to Tuesday night’s game, Golden State had won 12 of 16 games, climbing to the 8-seed in the West. Butler was in the midst of a typically excellent season, averaging 20 points, six rebounds, and five assists on lights-out efficiency. All of it came to a halt in the third quarter of Monday’s win over Miami, when Butler’s knee buckled on landing after he jumped to catch a pass.

Butler’s injury is at once clarifying and confounding for the Warriors. Any hopes that Dunleavy and the front office harbored about making noise in the playoffs are dashed. Even a splashy trade deadline acquisition wouldn’t do enough to elevate a team that relies on Butler’s defense and secondary playmaking. Bigger picture, Golden State now finds itself in a hole so deep—with an old roster, a series of misses in the draft, and now a devastating injury—that it may be impossible to dig out of.

When Joe Lacob and Peter Gruber purchased the team in 2010, Lacob aimed to re-create the Celtics dynasties he watched as a child in New England. He installed luminaries like Jerry West and Rick Welts into leadership roles, and hired a young Bob Myers. Those decisions paid off, as Myers rounded out the roster around Curry and Klay Thompson by drafting Draymond Green and acquiring complementary veterans like Andre Iguodala, Leandro Barbosa, and Shaun Livingston. The Warriors won the title in 2015. After the 2016 season, Golden State added Kevin Durant and he helped them add two more titles to the trophy case.

In recent years, Lacob’s grip on basketball decisions has clouded Golden State’s future around Curry. In 2020, he grew enamored of James Wiseman after a predraft workout, pushing the team to draft the 6-foot-11 center instead of flipping the no. 2 pick for an established player. The following year, he pushed his front office to draft Jonathan Kuminga over Trey Murphy III, whom many on the staff pushed for, seeing the 18-year-old as a potential star who could both help Curry in the short term and then fill the seats of Chase Center long after Curry was gone.

Now in his fifth season, Kuminga’s career has been defined by tension with the coaching staff and an inability to hold down a role within the Warriors’ system. And despite the star power Golden State still possesses, its season has been defined by Kuminga’s discontent. Over the summer, the team and Kuminga’s representatives engaged in an intense negotiation before reaching a two-year pact during training camp. But that détente was short-lived. Another clash with Steve Kerr left Kuminga on the bench for 16 straight games entering Tuesday evening. And last week, Kuminga officially demanded a trade.

The Warriors have been trying to offload Kuminga’s contract since last summer, to no avail. “When you make a demand,” Dunleavy said on Tuesday, “there needs to be a demand on the market. So we’ll see where that unfolds.”

In Butler’s absence against the Raptors, Kuminga did his best to fill the void and audition for the rest of the league, scoring 20 points in 21 minutes, including a buzzer-beater to end the third quarter, prompting a Lacob fist pump. The performance, which happened mostly during garbage time, helped Golden State whittle Toronto’s lead to 11 before the Raptors rebounded to hold on to the win and snap a two-game skid.

Following the defeat, Kerr remained positive. “We’re well equipped with our depth to continue to play at a high level,” he said, citing the offseason signings of guard De’Anthony Melton and veteran big Al Horford, who didn’t play Tuesday evening to preserve his 39-year-old body, as reasons to be hopeful. “I think we have enough to compete,” Kerr added.

But Kerr’s future is still up in the air. This is the final year of his contract, and as of Wednesday, he has yet to sign a new deal. Though Kerr has publicly been mum about his future, multiple assistant coaches have been operating under the premise that he will not return next season, according to team sources, with some surveying the league to secure jobs next season. Last month, longtime assistant Chris DeMarco left the staff to be the head coach of WNBA’s New York Liberty.

Butler’s future is also up in the air. Last spring, he entered a marriage of convenience with Golden State, which offered him a two-year extension that lined his contract length up with The injury marks a devastating turn for one of the game’s great players and one of its most compelling personalities. Butler will turn 37 in September; the team has yet to offer a timetable for his return, but his recovery could keep him out for part of next season, as well.

The Warriors will have more options over the summer than they will between now and the trade deadline next month. Still, on Tuesday evening, Dunleavy seemed open to any possibility, including parting with draft picks to salvage another shot at contention with Curry. At 25-20, the Warriors sit eighth in the West, 2.5 games out of the 6-seed and five games over the Clippers in 10th.

Time is ticking. Curry will turn 38 in March. He’s still capable of greatness, but his team has no road map back to the league’s mountaintop.

It’s been a long time coming, but it’s still striking to see the Warriors like this. Butler’s injury feels like yet another body blow to a dynasty that rose to power with a joyful, unbridled swagger. Even during lean times, the Warriors projected optimism about the future. But late Tuesday night, as they prepped for a four-game winter road trip, the cold reality of NBA purgatory set in.

“We’ve got to get through it,” Green said. “Injuries happen and that’s why you got 15 guys on a roster. Somebody else or collectively got to step up. But I believe we can figure it out. What does that mean for us long term? I don’t know.

“If I had all the answers right now, I would gladly give them to you. But I just don’t.”",https://wp.theringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/cropped-nextforwarriors_getty_ringer-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 16:01:51.618643

As he sat in front of the podium late Monday night, trying to process what Jimmy Butler’s knee injury meant to the Golden State Warriors — and himself — Curry paused, deciding he wasn’t ready to answer the question asked of him.

“I won’t talk about him being out until we know what’s going on,” Curry said.

But everyone in Chase Center already knew when Butler fell awkwardly on his right knee. An MRI later confirmed it: Butler had a season-ending ACL injury. He was done for the year.

Butler’s injury also officially closed the Warriors’ final hope of making one last title push in the Curry era. The Warriors were built, after a trade just before last season’s deadline, around two future Hall of Famers, Curry and Butler, with no runway beyond the present. Curry will turn 38 on March 14. Butler will be 37 in September. The window, in theory, was open through the end of 2026-27. Well, it closed Monday night.

No team can afford a season-ending injury to a star player. But Butler’s injury feels different. This iteration of the Warriors, with Curry at the forefront and Butler serving as an essential wingman, was built for now.

Warriors owner Joe Lacob and GM Mike Dunleavy have to acknowledge that.

Best-case scenario, Butler returns about a year from now after months of rehab. Despite dealing with numerous injuries over his career, it would be unreasonable to expect him to return at the same level. Draymond Green, who turns 36 in March, has already shown signs of regression. Without meaningful games to play, sustaining his standard high level of play becomes harder.

Curry and Green won’t leave quietly. Their pride and legacy — the one they created alongside former Warriors great Klay Thompson — means a lot to them.

The hope that followed Butler’s arrival last February and a late-season surge during which the Warriors won 12 of their last 16 games is gone. The idea that they’d be able to win another championship, as far-fetched as it seemed even before Butler got hurt, has also vanished. Expecting Curry to carry another flawed team for another season at this level, despite his greatness, is unrealistic.

Financially, the Warriors are stuck. Butler is making over $54 million this season and nearly $57 million next season while rehabbing. There is no player out there that the Warriors could acquire via trade that replaces what Butler provided next to Curry. The Warriors’ fan base, which was clamoring for a trade long before Butler’s injury, has to accept that there’s only so much Lacob and Dunleavy can do.

Some Warriors fans are still holding onto the dream of landing Giannis Antetokounmpo in a deal. As The Athletic’s Danny Leroux noted, Butler and Antetokounmpo have essentially the same cap slot in a max deal, making a swap theoretically easier during the summer when Golden State would no longer be hard-capped and able to take on more salary. If they were to wait until after the draft, the Warriors would be able to offer a wider variety of picks, including both their 2026 and 2027 selections, without being impacted by the Stepien rule.

But unless Antetokounmpo forces his way to the Bay, the Bucks would certainly receive better offers than a package built around Butler’s expiring deal and future picks/young assets. That also assumes Antetokounmpo would even ask out of Milwaukee, something he repeatedly has said he would never do. Also, it’s fair to wonder if a Warriors’ future centered around Curry, Antetokounmpo and very few future picks is much better than the one that’s staring them in the face now.

Dunleavy is stuck in no man’s land as far as any next moves go. The Warriors are hard-capped at the second apron, aging and no longer a contender. Could they package Butler’s expiring deal with other players and picks for another player? Sure, but he wouldn’t fit better than Butler.

Frankly, the more pressing short-term question for Dunleavy should be whether he should move some players to set up next season.

Lacob is competitive and badly wants to win. After Curry broke his hand in the fourth game of the 2019-20 season and missed four months, Lacob scoffed at the idea that the Warriors would tank — even though Curry’s injury, Thompson’s ACL ailment and a general lack of talent put the Warriors at 15-50 and led them to the No. 2 pick in 2020 NBA Draft, which turned out to be James Wiseman.

Over the past month, this group started to find a rhythm, at least, in part due to Butler’s renewed offensive presence and foul-drawing ability, which helped take the pressure off Curry. Without him, the Warriors would be better served to see what they can get on the market for some of their veterans.

De’Anthony Melton, who missed almost all of last season while rehabbing his own ACL injury, has really turned a corner in recent weeks. At 27, and with a player option next season that he seems likely to decline, the Warriors risk letting him walk for nothing. Wouldn’t it make more sense to get an asset in return?

Al Horford came to the Warriors believing he would have a better chance to win a championship this season than he would with the Boston Celtics. The 39-year-old has really struggled this season due to injuries and inconsistency, but his veteran presence still holds value to a contender. The Warriors are no longer one.

Jonathan Kuminga’s status remains in flux, his present clouded by speculation about his future. Warriors coach Steve Kerr said after Monday’s game that he was open to using Kuminga in Butler’s absence, but it’s unclear, even after Kuminga returned to the rotation Tuesday, if either side still wants a professional partnership.

All of those factors point back to the question that Curry wasn’t ready to answer out loud. Without Butler in the fold, any hope for the foreseeable future is gone. Even with Butler, the Warriors were mediocre, trying to stay afloat. Or as Kerr put it last month, “We are a fading dynasty. We know that. Everybody knows that.”

Now, the fading is over.

Another deep run in the Champions League will test Arsenal’s squad depth, but as they — through Jesus — showed against Inter, that’s something they have plenty of right now.","Mikel Arteta has a decision to make.

The Spaniard and his coaching staff will have left Milan with one question in their mind: Has Gabriel Jesus now forced his way into the starting XI for Arsenal’s game against Manchester United on Sunday?

That is likely what Arteta will be pondering in the coming days after the Brazilian striker scored twice in his side’s Champions League victory away to Inter on Tuesday night.

It was the first time Jesus, 28, had netted twice in a match since his brace against Crystal Palace in December 2024, although being sidelined with an ACL injury for 11 months is the biggest contributing factor behind that statistic.

But even in recent weeks, with the striker making several appearances off the bench, he hadn’t done anything overly impressive, bar an immediate impact as a substitute against Aston Villa in December.

That changed against Inter, though — and now Arteta will have to decide whether he drops Viktor Gyokeres from his Premier League XI, something he has yet to do this season despite the summer signing’s lack of goals. The fact that Gyokeres came off the bench to add Arsenal’s third at San Siro will only complicate Arteta’s thinking.

“We have been missing Gabi a lot and I think this (his performance) is going to raise his confidence level and the team’s because we now have different profiles in that position, like we have with the wingers, and the fact those players are playing at that level and having an impact in the game is only going to make us better,” Arteta said in his post-match press conference.

It is also fair to wonder when Kai Havertz, who was left on the bench as an unused substitute against Inter, will be given the nod, despite the fact that he is yet to start a match following his return from a lengthy spell out with a knee injury that required surgery.

But from the moment Jesus stepped foot in San Siro — which was on Monday night as he was the player selected to speak to the media ahead of the match — he showed his calm confidence.

For around 20 minutes, Jesus answered a series of questions — often taking a considered pause to think before responding — ranging from his thoughts on Gyokeres’ form, whether his past experiences at Manchester City can help Arsenal win the Premier League and his hopes to remain at the club beyond the end of his existing deal.

Jesus’ contract expires in June 2027, and he made it clear that he hopes to remain at the Emirates and “win trophies” at the club, only to then add that discussions were yet to take place between himself and Arsenal over fresh terms.

If he continues to score between now and the end of the season and proves to be decisive as Arsenal compete on four fronts, then you would expect his stock to only rise.

One potential stumbling block to whether Jesus retains his position in the starting XI for Manchester United is that Arteta failed to keep Noni Madueke in the team after he scored twice away to Club Brugge in December.

“I think in a club like Arsenal, there is no guaranteeing a spot to anyone,” Jesus said on Monday. But for a game as important as Sunday’s, especially after Arsenal have drawn their last two league games, it would be bold for Arteta to decide against selecting a striker who is full of confidence.

That is not to diminish the role Gyokeres has been playing in recent months, with Arteta and his team-mates often pointing out that his movement off the ball is hugely beneficial when it comes to dragging opposition players with him and creating space for others to attack.

Goals will always be a striker’s main currency, though.

And the first of the Brazilian’s first-half double came after a delightful passage of build-up play on the edge of the area from Arsenal that saw Eberechi Eze pass to Jesus, who then knocked it to Mikel Merino, who switched it to Myles Lewis-Skelly. His lateral pass was met by Jurrien Tmiber, only for his scuffed, spinning shot to find Jesus, who anticipated the ball dropping his way and made the run to turn it in.

His second, unsurprisingly, came from a corner kick. Leandro Trossard nodded Bukayo Saka’s deep corner back into the danger area via the crossbar and Jesus was there to head home from close range.

“If I were Gabriel Jesus now, I’d be saying: ‘I want to start the game on Sunday’,” Wayne Rooney, the former Manchester United striker, told Amazon Prime after the game.

Jesus’ goals also meant Arsenal have now won all seven of their Champions League matches, conceding only twice in the process, and confirming a top-two finish, which means they will have home advantage in the second leg of all knockout rounds they progress to.

The attacker will be seen by a specialist in the coming days, after which his prognosis will become clearer.

Grealish played the whole of the away win to former side Aston Villa on Sunday.

The 30-year-old joined Everton on loan last summer, with an option to buy in the region of £50million ($67.3m), after falling down the pecking order at Manchester City and not being selected to travel to the Club World Cup in the United States.

He has made 20 league appearances this season — the same number as across the 2024-25 season with City — registering two goals and six assists in that time.

Everton saw the return of captain Seamus Coleman to the bench on Sunday after a hamstring injury, while centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite is still yet to play this season.

They also will have Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gueye back from the Africa Cup of Nations after the pair won the competition with Senegal on Sunday.

What this setback means for Everton

Analysis by Everton correspondent Patrick Boyland

We will have to wait for the specialist to determine the full extent of Grealish’s issue but Tuesday’s news clearly does not bode well.

The 30-year-old loanee has been a key performer so far this season, even if his output has dried up in recent months after a scintillating start.

With Everton already missing a number of key players, there is also a cruelty about this latest setback. Having spent the last month playing with a threadbare squad, it had looked like their crippling injury worries would start to ease.

Iliman Ndiaye and Idrissa Gueye are due back later this week after winning the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) with Senegal, while defender Jarrad Branthwaite is stepping up his own return from a long-term hamstring problem.

Yet Grealish’s injury now gives manager David Moyes a further selection headache and leaves Everton without their talisman at a key juncture in the season. They have invested heavily in the England man, paying around £250,000 of his £300,000 City salary, and an extended absence would harm their chances of qualifying for Europe.

There will no doubt now be a real temptation to pitch Ndiaye straight back into action for Monday’s visit of Leeds United. Like Gueye, he is currently celebrating Senegal’s AFCON win in Dakar.

Fellow winger Dwight McNeil has been the subject of transfer speculation but will now almost certainly be needed too, while summer signing Tyler Dibling will also hope for a more game-time.

Prater’s play allowed Bills Mafia to forget about Bass, and it’s more than likely many would not be opposed to him giving it one more season with Buffalo.","The Buffalo Bills season is now in the rearview mirror, which gives us a good opportunity to begin breaking down how the team performed during the 2025 NFL season. Over the next couple weeks, we’ll break down this past season’s roster based on position groups.

We’ll begin by taking a look back at the Bills’ place-kicking situation — perhaps an underrated group, but one that plays a huge role in every game’s outcome. Buffalo entered the 2025 season expecting Tyler Bass to handle all kicking duties (not including punting). Things veered off path very quickly, where during the preseason Bass dealt with a hip/groin injury that landed him on Injured Reserve to begin the regular season. There was some hope Bass would be back during the season, but in December he needed surgery, which officially ended his season.

With little notice before Week 1 to find a new kicker, the Bills turned to veteran Matt Prater who

started the season with a walk-off win against the Baltimore Ravens. The 41-year-old veteran became a viable weapon for Buffalo, making 90% of his kicks. Then, Prater suffered a quad injury against the

New England Patriots in Week 15. The injury left the postseason in doubt as Prater was pulled in the regular-season finale against the New York Jets after reportedly tweaking the injury.

However, Prater said he was good to go for the postseason, and sure enough he was right. Prater went 5-of-5

on his field goals in the playoffs, including a 50-yard kick against the Denver Broncos to send the game into overtime. Prater was also 6-of-6 on extra-point attempts when points were at a premium against the Jacksonville Jaguars and Broncos.

Prater earns a solid A for the season, showing the world that he can still be an effective kicker in the twilight of his NFL career. He comes up just short of an A+ solely due to giving fans a heart attack thinking he would not be available for the playoffs.

It will be interesting to see if Prater decides to give it one more season or at least comes back for training

camp, should the Bills be in the market. Prater’s play allowed Bills Mafia to forget about Bass, and it’s more than likely many would not be opposed to him giving it one more season with Buffalo.",https://platform.buffalorumblings.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2026/01/gettyimages-2257218209.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.730440268852%2C100%2C78.539119462295&w=1200,N,,2026-01-21 14:03:15.704414

Cybercitizens quickly dubbed it “NFL Injury Theory: EM fields from nearby substation causing injuries to San Francisco 49ers.” One said, “CMC transmitting the soul-crushing electromagnetic waves from the 49ers practice facility directly into Jimmy Butler’s knee.” Another urged, “Someone gotta shut down that way station.” A third supposedly blamed McCaffrey and Juszczyk: “They brought the electricity.” A fourth speculated, “At this point the players are carriers of electromagnetic energy.” A fifth said, “The Substation has transitive properties.” A user declared, “It’s got to be that practice field electricity! It’s contagious!” Another said, “They *are* the substation now [crying face emoji].” A third user commented, “The injury disease hopped off the Niners onto the Warriors.” Now, the injury history of each of the two 49ers is most important here.

More injuries since 49ers players moved to Levi’s Stadium in 2014

Peter Cowan, a researcher, recently tweeted: The San Francisco 49ers are statistically the most injured team in the NFL over the past decade. Since they moved to Levi’s Stadium in 2014, there have been seven to eight full Achilles or patellar ruptures, over 40 major hamstring or calf tears, and high-ankle syndesmosis [ligament] injuries every year.

The Denver Broncos' season changed in an instant on their game-winning drive against the Buffalo Bills in the AFC Divisional Round, but not in the way they thought.

Yes, they advanced to the AFC Championship Game, but quarterback Bo Nix was also injured on the drive. He fractured his ankle.

The news didn't emerge until after the game, and it forced the Broncos to face a shocking reality, that backup QB Jarrett Stidham will start against the New England Patriots with a spot in the Super Bowl on the line.

Some Broncos fans are still holding out hope for Nix, though, thanks to a viral post on social media that isn't what first meets the eye.

Is Bo Nix playing this week?

No, Bo Nix is not playing in the AFC Championship Game.

The Broncos' QB has already been ruled out, and he was supposed to undergo surgery already this week.

The hope comes from a viral fake post from NFL Drop, which acknowledges in its bio that it's a satire account:

MORE: Could the Raiders trade the No. 1 pick and Fernando Mendoza?

The Broncos are expected to roll with Stidham, backed up by Sam Ehlinger, with the newly signed Ben DiNucci around in case of emergencies.

The best Nix will be able to do is advise Stidham and help him through the tough assignment.

It certainly wasn't the first time Nix has suffered a serious ankle injury in his football career.

Back in 2017, he missed four high school games with an ankle fracture before returning to lead Pinson Valley to a championship. Four years later, Nix suffered a broken ankle while playing at Auburn in 2021. Three years after that, following his 2024 rookie season, Nix underwent a ""routine and minor"" cleanup procedure on his ankle in early 2025.

Now, two years into his pro career, Nix is undergoing another ankle surgery. After breaking the news on Saturday night, Denver coach Sean Payton praised the QB's outlook.

""He’s such a strong, faith-based guy,"" Payton said. ""He was sitting in the hallway with his family, and I went over, and we’re all talking to him. He knows that God has a plan for him.""

Then came the Payton zinger.

""He said he had one in high school, and then he said he had one at Auburn. I said, ‘I didn’t realize that.’ I said, ‘If I would have known that, I wouldn’t have drafted you.’ He’s a tough cookie.""

Payton, of course, was joking. NFL teams do extensive medical research on each prospect coming into the draft, and the Broncos undoubtedly knew about Nix's previous ankle injuries. The 25-year-old quarterback bounced back from his previous setbacks, and he'll aim to do so again in 2026.

In the meantime, Denver's turning to Jarrett Stidham for the rest of the 2025 playoffs.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/20/SBRC/88258414007-sean-payton-joke-bo-nix-ankle.jpg?crop=4615,2596,x0,y240&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-21 12:05:26.774077

Renowned orthopedic surgeon Dr. Neal ElAttrache performed Kittle’s surgery last week in Los Angeles and said it was a clean tear near the soleus muscle that is located higher on the Achilles tendon. This news should offer some hope that Kittle’s recovery may not be as prolonged as initially expected.

“They didn’t have to drill into my heel,” Kittle said. “Where the repair was, there’s more blood flow so it takes some time off the recovery time. So he’s very excited about everything. My recovery — when I’ll be running, when I’ll be ready to go play again — he’s very excited about it. So that puts me in a really good mood. It’s not as bad as other ones.”

Kittle said it “felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger.” From this feeling, Kittle knew immediately that he’d just suffered a serious injury. The seven-time Pro Bowl tight end isn’t giving a timeline for his return, keeping it a surprise for now. When the injury occurred in Philadelphia, 49ers owner Jed York was in attendance and joined Kittle in the locker room after he was carted off the field.

“Getting his support was absolutely fantastic,” Kittle said. “Just the fact that the team owner comes down to come give his condolences to you, and just like stays there for you, just really means what kind of place this is, and the people that are in this building. And it makes me really happy to be a Niner.”

The injury means backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham will be asked to start at home against the New England Patriots with a Super Bowl berth on the line. Denver entered the postseason as the AFC’s No. 1 seed and owns an 8-1 home record this season. But the sudden change at quarterback has made the Patriots 5.5-point favorites and dramatically shifted the outlook of the Broncos’ season.

It is not the first time across sports that a late-season injury to a key player has significantly altered championship hopes. In some cases, backups stepped in and saved the day.

In Week 14 of the 2017 NFL season, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles came in for injured MVP candidate Carson Wentz and finished the journey through a Super Bowl win over the New England Patriots.

In 1990, Jeff Hostetler took over for New York Giants starting quarterback Phil Simms, who broke his foot in Week 15. Five wins and one precariously wide-right kick from Buffalo Bills kicker Scott Norwood later, Hostetler and the Giants were Super Bowl champions.

Kenyon Martin, 1999-2000 Cincinnati Bearcats

The Bearcats were 28-2, ranked No. 1, and in Martin had the national player of the year and eventual No. 1 NBA Draft pick by the New Jersey Nets. But the big man broke his fibula in the Conference USA Tournament. UC was dropped to a No. 2 seed, then lost in the second round of the 2000 NCAA Tournament, 69-61, to Tulsa.

Martin had led the conference in scoring (18.9 points per game) and blocks (3.5), while adding 9.7 rebounds. Without Martin, the Bearcats were outrebounded 39-34 in their tournament loss to the Golden Hurricane.

Kyrie Irving, 2015 Cleveland Cavaliers

The Cavs’ All-Star point guard fractured his kneecap in Game 1 of the 2015 NBA Finals, the first of four straight finals matchups between the Cavaliers and Warriors.

In the prior series, Kevin Love suffered a severe left shoulder injury against the Boston Celtics that knocked him out of the finals as well. Though LeBron James tried to carry the load alone, the absence of the team’s second- and third-leading scorers and leading rebounder was too much even for James to overcome.

The Warriors went on to win the series in six games, their first of four titles in the Steph Curry-Steve Kerr era.

Tyrese Haliburton, 2025 Indiana Pacers

Haliburton was the Pacers’ best player in the 2025 playoffs, taking Indiana to Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the favored Oklahoma City Thunder.

But he was playing with a strained right calf that he suffered in Game 5, and it proved to be a ticking time bomb. After catching fire and hitting three triples in the first seven minutes of Game 7, his calf gave out on a drive, and he tore his Achilles.

As Haliburton left the court in tears, the Pacers were trailing only 18-16. Oklahoma City went on to win 103-91 to take the series.

Colt McCoy, 2009-10 Texas Longhorns

Texas’ starting quarterback, a first-team All-American, suffered a pinched nerve in his throwing shoulder in the first quarter of the 2010 national championship game against Alabama.

McCoy had finished third in Heisman voting that season, but freshman Garrett Gilbert had to replace him, and Texas lost 37-21 to a Crimson Tide squad led by Heisman winner Mark Ingram.

Juju Watkins, 2025 USC Trojans

USC was a No. 1 seed in the 2025 NCAA Women’s Tournament when Watkins tore her ACL against Mississippi State in the second round. Watkins was fourth in the nation in scoring that season, averaging 23.9 points per game. She won AP player of the year and was named a first-team AP All-American after leading USC to a Big Ten title.

Without her, the Trojans managed to dispatch the Bulldogs 96-59 and advanced to the Elite Eight, where they lost to eventual champion UConn, 78-64.

Jim Rice, 1975 Boston Red Sox

The Red Sox had two leading contenders for AL Rookie of the Year in 1975, future Hall of Famer Jim Rice and outfielder Fred Lynn. Lynn took home rookie of the year and AL MVP, the first to win both in the same year, but Rice was stellar that season as well. He hit 22 home runs with a .309 batting average, .350 on-base and .491 slugging percentage.

In late September, Rice broke his hand after being hit by a pitch against the Detroit Tigers. He missed the rest of the season, including the entire postseason. In his absence, the Red Sox made the Fall Classic, but lost to the Cincinnati Reds in an exhilarating seven-game series coined “the series that saved baseball.”

The defeat also furthered the “Curse of the Bambino,” as Boston had remained without a championship since selling Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees following the 1919 season. The Red Sox could not break the curse until 2004.

Brock Purdy, 2022-23 San Francisco 49ers

Purdy’s improbable rookie season ended at the worst time, with a UCL injury in the first quarter of the 2023 NFC Championship Game against the Eagles, which the 49ers lost 31-7. The Mr. Irrelevant pick, taken last in the 2022 NFL Draft, had fought his way up from the practice squad to take over starting duties that season in Week 13 after Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo suffered major injuries.

Purdy had won seven consecutive games, including the first two rounds of the playoffs, before being forced to exit the NFC Championship Game. Josh Johnson was tabbed to finish the game but suffered a concussion in the third quarter, which, for a brief moment, had running back Christian McCaffrey readying a helmet with a radio before Purdy returned. Purdy was unable to throw, however, and simply had to hand the ball off for the remainder of the game.

Carey Price, 2013-14 Montreal Canadiens

The Canadiens goaltender suffered a knee injury when New York Rangers forward Chris Kreider crashed into him in Game 1 of the 2014 Eastern Conference final. Price was out for the rest of the series, and the Canadiens lost the series 4-2.

Price had career bests in games played (59), wins (34), goals-against average (2.32) and save percentage (.927) that season. Without him for much of the series, the Rangers peppered the Montreal net for 20 goals over six games, an average of 3.33 per contest.

Derrick Rose, 2011-12 Chicago Bulls

Chicago’s point guard was on top of the basketball world entering the 2012 NBA playoffs. Chicago was the No. 1 seed, and Rose was one year removed from being the youngest MVP in NBA history.

But he tore his ACL in Game 1 of the first-round series against the eighth-seeded Philadelphia 76ers. Without its MVP, Chicago lost the series 4-2, and Rose’s career never fully recovered. Since then, the Bulls have only been to the playoffs five times and have only won two playoff series.

The Broncos will have to continue their journey through the AFC Championship Game, and potentially beyond, without starting quarterback Bo Nix. It was announced shortly after Denver’s 33-30 AFC divisional-round win over the Buffalo Bills that Nix had broken his ankle on one of the game’s final plays.

The injury means backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham will be asked to start at home against the New England Patriots with a Super Bowl berth on the line. Denver entered the postseason as the AFC’s No. 1 seed and owns an 8-1 home record this season. But the sudden change at quarterback has made the Patriots 5.5-point favorites and dramatically shifted the outlook of the Broncos’ season.

It is not the first time across sports that a late-season injury to a key player has significantly altered championship hopes. In some cases, backups stepped in and saved the day.

In Week 14 of the 2017 NFL season, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick Foles came in for injured MVP candidate Carson Wentz and finished the journey through a Super Bowl win over the New England Patriots.

In 1990, Jeff Hostetler took over for New York Giants starting quarterback Phil Simms, who broke his foot in Week 15. Five wins and one precariously wide-right kick from Buffalo Bills kicker Scott Norwood later, Hostetler and the Giants were Super Bowl champions.

Unfortunately, it doesn’t always work out. Here are 10 examples across sports in which a major injury changed a team’s fortune. Let us know in the comments which ones we missed.

Kevin Durant and Klay Thompson, 2019 Golden State Warriors

The Golden State Warriors suffered a double whammy in the 2019 NBA Finals. With the Warriors trailing the series 3-1 entering Game 5, Durant tore his Achilles after just 12 minutes of court time. Golden State managed to win the game to stay alive, but then Klay Thompson tore his ACL in Game 6. Without the team’s second- and third-leading scorers that season, the Warriors lost the finals 4-2 to the Toronto Raptors.

Following Bo Nix’s season-ending ankle injury, Stidham has a chance to lead the Broncos past the Patriots into the Super Bowl when the teams play in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday.

The former fourth-round pick can also join Brady and a handful of others in an exclusive club of signal-callers to lead their team to the Super Bowl following injuries to the starter.

Jordy Fee-Platt of The Athletic discussed on Tuesday eight quarterbacks in NFL history who have accomplished the feat.

“Stidham has just four career NFL starts, so it will be a tall task for him to win two playoff games. But he is far from the first quarterback to attempt this feat,” Fee-Platt wrote. “In fact, several backup signal callers have succeeded in taking their teams to the Super Bowl following midseason injuries to starters. Many inherited situations that were far worse than what Stidham is facing.”

Among the men under center to take over the starting job and get their group to the big game are 1971 first overall pick Jim Plunkett (1980 season), Hall of Famer Kurt Warner (1999), Brady (2001), Colin Kaepernick (2012) and one-time Pro Bowler Nick Foles (2017).

“In Week 2 of the 2001 season, Patriots starter Drew Bledsoe suffered internal bleeding from a hit by Jets linebacker Mo Lewis. New England started 0-2, but Brady went 11-3 as the starter, and the Patriots won the AFC East and earned a first-round bye,” Fee-Platt said. “Thanks to some help from the ‘Tuck Rule,’ Brady beat the Oakland Raiders in a blizzard in the divisional round. He injured his knee in the second quarter of the AFC Championship Game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, as Bledsoe replaced him and won the game. However, Brady returned for the Super Bowl and helped New England beat the St. Louis Rams 20-17 as 14-point underdogs. And the rest is history.”

Stidham will look to become just the second quarterback since 1950 to make his first start of the season in the playoffs and win.

With 7:41 left in the third quarter, Brandin Podziemski tried to float a post entry pass over the top to Butler, who had his man sealed; however, as he went up for the catch, Davion Mitchell collided with Butler, who came down awkwardly on his right leg.

With Butler's season officially over, Golden State's campaign might be as well. The Warriors (25-19 after Monday's win and currently eighth in the West) were already going to have to go on a big second-half run to crawl above the play-in line.

Headed into Sunday’s AFC title game at home against the New England Patriots, here the Broncos are and there Wattenberg is, with a chance to return to the field.

“Luke Wattenberg is eligible to return off IR this week and play in the AFC Championship,” DNVR’s Zac Stevens wrote on X on Tuesday, January 20. “When originally placed on IR, Sean Payton indicated his timetable to return would be right around the 4 week IR mark. So there’s a chance he’s back this week.”

Shoulder Injury Sidelined Wattenberg

Wattenberg appeared to injure his shoulder in a 34-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 16 which snapped the Broncos’ 11-game winning streak.

“The Broncos placed starting C Luke Wattenberg on IR today with a shoulder injury,” NFL Network’s Mike Garofolo wrote on X. “He’s out through the first two playoff games with an injury that’s still being evaluated to determine if he can return later in the postseason.”

Wattenberg signed a 4-year, $48 million contract extension on November 25 that made him one of the Top 10 highest paid players at his position in the NFL.

The team bounced back to win its final 2 games of the regular season with Alex Forsyth starting at center. Forsyth started 4 games for the Broncos at center in 2024 when Wattenberg was out with an ankle injury.

Broncos Have One of NFL’s Elite Centers

When Wattenberg is on the field, there’s little doubt he’s one of the NFL’s very best at his position.

Wattenberg’s 70.9 overall grade from Pro Football Focus this season put him ninth among 40 eligible players at his position.

“Center Luke Wattenberg has been placed on IR,” Broncos.com’s Alec DiLalla wrote on X. “Had played all 1,005 of the Broncos’ offensive snaps to start the season.”

Wattenberg was a fifth round pick in the 2022 NFL draft out of the University of Washington and became the full-time starter for the first time in 2024.

In 2025, he’d started all 15 games before being placed on injured reserve.

His come-up in the NFL went against projections for him headed into the 2022 NFL draft, where NFL draft expert Lance Zierlein predicted he would be signed as a priority free agent and had little chance of making a 53-man roster.

“Wattenberg has played a lot of football over his six years at Washington, but a career in the NFL might not be in the cards,” Zierlein wrote in his pre-draft evaluation. “He lacks the ability to anchor in and battle against bigger players across from him. He’s athletic in space, has good length and can get to most run blocks, but playing with functional strength to get wins on reps might be too great a challenge at the next level.”",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/nbcsports.brightspotcdn_2a1097-e1768930526132.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-21 13:03:06.289760

""Absolute whirlwind of emotions after the game last night. Ultimately so proud of these boys & what they have accomplished this so far. do it for 10!!!!"" Kennedy wrote, via the New York Post, referencing Nix's jersey number.

The veteran quarterback in Stidham, who at one point was considered to be the heir to the Patriots’ starting job once Tom Brady departed for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, received a huge boost of confidence from Broncos head coach Sean Payton.

""It started with our evaluation in New Orleans of him,"" Payton said when asked why he believed Stidham was ready for the challenge. ""He was a target for us in the draft. That doesn’t really mean anything other than we liked this player coming out. I know how he was coached in New England. I know exactly how he was coached in New England. Then I know how [Patriots offensive coordinator Josh] McDaniels felt about him when he brought him from New England to Vegas. Then I know reports on how he played, and then we saw him play real time.

""But ultimately, to answer your question, it’s our three years here. In our three years, watching him day-in and day-out that you guys don’t have access to. He will be ready to go and ready for the moment.""

Here's who's left in the NFL Power Rankings and today's predictions, odds on who is going to play in Super Bowl 2026.

The Divisional Round delivered disappointment for some Super Bowl hopefuls such as the Buffalo Bills, Houston Texans, Chicago Bears and the San Francisco 49ers, in their crushing loss to Super Bowl LX favorite Seattle Seahawks.

But elimination wasn't the only bad news after the weekend games.

Headed to this weekend's final playoff games is the Denver Broncos team without their star quarterback Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury during their winning game against the Bills. In his place for the upcoming AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots will be Jarret Stidham and backup Sam Ehlinger or newly signed Ben DiNucci from the practice squad.

New England Patriots lead the remaining Super Bowl hopefuls with 11 appearances and six wins, Denver Broncos have three wins out of eight appearances, Los Angeles Rams (St. Louis Rams) have two wins out of three appearances, and the Seattle Seahawks have won one of two.

Because I have a feeling he’s going to be even more motivated than ever to prove himself in 2026.
When he’s engaged, he’s a really good player.
He’s another guy I’m hoping comes back even better than ever next season.
I know those first two Rams vs. Seahawks games this season were lose—both were decided by a combined three points.","1. Congratulations to the Chicago Bears on one of the most fun seasons of football they’ve ever put together. Seriously. That was awesome. Obviously, it’s over now, but it was awesome to take the ride with all of you.

2. Weren’t we just talking about how Caleb Williams just made the greatest throw Bears fans had ever seen against the Green Bay Packers—until he somehow makes the next one? Well…we didn’t think he was actually going to do it. What the hell is he going to do next? A walkoff Hail Mary to win the Super Bowl next year? Psh, there’s no way that will ever happen. I dare him to prove me wrong. But I bet he can’t. (Of course, it would be just as cool if he just dominated the old-fashioned way and won MVP next season by hitting more of the simple stuff. But again, bet he can’t do that, either. Boy, would that really show me if he did, though.)

3. Count me among the people who had it out for DJ Moore after that overtime interception, and the bits of context that have come in from film gurus haven’t made his play look any better there. But new hot take on this: I’m actually not mad at him anymore, and I hope the Bears don’t trade him this offseason (though it could definitely help them from a salary perspective). Because I have a feeling he’s going to be even more motivated than ever to prove himself in 2026. Here’s hoping that’s the case. When he’s engaged, he’s a really good player. What’s more: I like that Caleb Williams has taken accountability for that play rather than shifting the blame. This guy gets it.

4. I’m not the biggest Bo Nix fan in the world, but watching him go down with a broken ankle after a gutsy three-touchdown performance against the Buffalo Bills is extremely depressing. He deserved a chance to keep it going and prove all the haters wrong in the AFC Championship game (and potentially beyond). He’s another guy I’m hoping comes back even better than ever next season.

5. On the flip side of things: can I just say that I don’t feel even the slightest bit bad for Josh Allen? Yeah, I get it. The Bills don’t have a ton of other stars on that team, and the receiving corps, which was already worn down to the nub heading into the Broncos game, only got more injured during the contest. But let’s not pretend his offensive line didn’t give him enough time, and the defense didn’t do enough to keep them in the game. Allen’s miss of a wide-open Dalton Knox could’ve ensured the game never went to overtime in the first place, and the controversial overtime interception on the throw to Brandin Cooks wouldn’t have happened if Allen had put that ball out in front of Cooks, which he had more than enough arm to do. He doubtless holds himself to a higher standard than everyone else does, so it’s not an Allen problem. He’s still a great player and a top-five quarterback in the league. But he shouldn’t get a pass for this one—not when he wouldn’t even give himself one.

6. Allen’s young carbon copy, Drake Maye, on the other hand, might be getting narratively shafted a bit. He obviously hasn’t performed quite to the same level as he did in the regular season as he’s played a much higher level of defense, and that has shown itself in his six overall fumbles and three total giveaways (two INTs, one lost fumble). You simply can’t put the ball in harm’s way that many times and consistently hope to win, though the Patriots’ defense has done more than its fair share to pick him up so far in the postseason. But this is where you look at context. Not a single player on New England’s offense (aside from Maye) earned an All-Pro or Pro Bowl nod. Maye’s first-round left tackle Will Campbell, who is still getting his legs under him after missing time with injury, has gotten annihilated in consecutive weeks by Khalil Mack and Will Anderson. No skill player aside from Maye keeps opponents up at night, not even Stefon Diggs. He’s speed-running the Infinity Gauntlet of top-10 defenses, having faced the second- and 10th-best scoring units in the league so far with the third-ranked unit on deck and the first-ranked final boss Seattle Seahawks possibly waiting in the Super Bowl. Regardless of who plays quarterback for the Broncos next week, getting this team to the title game would be an insane accomplishment.

7. I know those first two Rams vs. Seahawks games this season were lose—both were decided by a combined three points. But I just have this feeling like the Seahawks are going to come up with a level of rapacity the Rams won’t be able to match with the 12th man behind them at Lumen Field. That utter ass-whooping they just put on the (albeit banged up) San Francisco 49ers felt like a warning: this squad is on a mission. And no division rival is going to stand in their way. That said…division rivalries tend to be games where you throw all your expectations out the window. Should be fun.

8. I’m a crazy for thinking the Tennessee Titans might have hit a 400-foot home run with the Robert Saleh hire? I say this without knowing who he plans to have coach Cam Ward, of course. But I’d argue the quarterback situation was the only part of job he and his staff couldn’t figure out in New York, with the team getting saddled with three years of Zach Wilson and one with the “late-career Belichick” version of Aaron Rodgers. His defenses, though? Elite. Despite playing on a dumpster fire of a team, I feel comfortable enough believing Ward can at least be good if you give him anything resembling a representative NFL offense. That could be a sneaky-good hire. Plus, we can watch Saleh and Liam Coen stare daggers at each other twice a year instead of shaking hands. And you thought the Ben Johnson-Matt LaFleur situation was testy…

9. We all thought that the Steelers-Ravens game in Week 18 was a battle to determined whether John Harbaugh of Mike Tomlin kept their jobs. Turns out, both of them were doomed and didn’t know it. (I know Tomlin “stepped down” from the Steelers, but it was probably more of a “We don’t want to have to fire you, so let’s resolve this amicably” affair.) Just like that, almost 40 combined seasons of those two coaches dueling twice a year is over. But neither one of them was going to be without a job for long. Harbaugh’s already back in the saddle with Jaxson Dart and the New York Giants, who will probably show immediate improvement in the NFC East next year. Meanwhile, though Tomlin won’t coach in 2026, half the league will come knocking his door down when he finally puts his “OpenToWork” sign up on LinkedIn. Being a good coach—even if not a great one—still matters in this league.

10. Please, please let this be the year Brian Flores’ maniacal ass gets a head coaching job with a good quarterback (and gets the hell out of the NFC North, or the NFC altogether). I hear Baltimore is nice this time of year. (It’s not, but that’s where I want to see him the most.) Also, that Matt Nagy first-year vibe bump is going to hit crazy for some NFL team next year—as will the comedown when that team realizes he can’t consistently call an NFL offense without Patrick Mahomes and/or Andy Reid to save his butt. His trick-play names will be fun, though!",https://platform.windycitygridiron.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/180/2026/01/gettyimages-2256469862.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.17856301212756%2C100%2C78.350745495549&w=1200,N,,2026-01-21 02:58:09.119544

A big part of the Bears' success on defense was the effort from Jaquan Brisker, who perhaps put together his best performance in a Bears uniform.
For the game, Brisker led the team with 14 tackles and 6 defensive stops while also contributing 2 passes defended as well as 1 sack.
Brisker's contributions stood out the most on the Rams' third possession of the game early in the second quarter.
The defensive line was surprisingly a plus for the Bears against the Rams, which can largely be attributed to the impact that Sweat made.","As alluded to earlier, Dennis Allen saved his best for last as he put together a masterful game plan on Sunday night. Allen had a tall task going up against the number one offense in the NFL with the potential MVP in Matthew Stafford, but for large stretches of the evening, he had them completely flustered. Allen did a good job of mixing up his looks with blitzes and simulated pressures that led to consistent pressure on Stafford. The Bears had four sacks for the game and that pass rush led to opportunities for turnovers that didn't quite materialize. The Rams were held well below their season averages in yards per play, passing yards per attempt and rushing yards per attempt, a testament to how well Allen had his unit prepared in all phases. While the defense did break at the end, it's important to remember that they did get a huge stop to begin overtime and gave the offense a chance to win the game. Looking back on the season, it was an up-and-down year for Allen and the defense, but they put together an admirable fight when it mattered the most.

A big part of the Bears' success on defense was the effort from Jaquan Brisker, who perhaps put together his best performance in a Bears uniform. For the game, Brisker led the team with 14 tackles and 6 defensive stops while also contributing 2 passes defended as well as 1 sack. Brisker was also charted as the second-highest graded defender for the Bears according to Pro Football Focus, with positive grades in all categories. Brisker's contributions stood out the most on the Rams' third possession of the game early in the second quarter. Brisker singlehandedly ended that drive with a series of three plays where he sacked Stafford for a big loss on first down before following that up with a tackle and a pass breakup down the field while covering Puka Nacua on third down. In what could have been his last game as a Bear, Brisker deserves the right to hold his head high as he was practically everywhere for the defense on Sunday.

Another player who played a substantial role in the defense having a strong performance was Montez Sweat. The defensive line was surprisingly a plus for the Bears against the Rams, which can largely be attributed to the impact that Sweat made. Sweat had a strip sack fumble early in the game while also leading the team with four combined pressures according to PFF. Sweat also played a large role in the run defense, which held the Rams to 3.6 yards per carry for the evening. All things considered, Sweat was the one consistent piece that held the defensive line together this season, which played out once again in the Divisional Round.

On the offensive side of the ball, the play of Joe Thuney should be commended on a night where the unit struggled as a whole. With Ozzy Trapilo out due to a patellar tendon injury suffered last week, Thuney made the switch from his usual left guard spot out to left tackle. Thuney isn't unaccustomed to this move, as he did the same thing for the Kansas City Chiefs last season when they were having issues at left tackle, but it's less than ideal to put him in that spot on short notice with the season on the line. With that said, Thuney played admirably against a formidable Rams edge room as he only allowed 2 pressures and finished with a 76.1 PFF pass block grade. As was the case all season long, Thuney was the glue that held this offensive line together as his flexibility allowed the Bears to avoid complete disaster on the left side.

Even though Ben Johnson deserves his flowers for changing the culture at Halas Hall and for bringing a playcalling edge on offense during his first season on the job, Sunday night was not his best moment. As has been the case at times this year, Johnson's offense was inconsistent as there were multiple rough stretches where the Bears simply couldn't move the ball. While many of these issues come down to execution, I also felt like this was an underwhelming day for Johnson as a playcaller. Nowhere was this more evident than in short-yardage situations. Time after time, it just felt like Johnson's playcalling was predictable on third and fourth down, with multiple stuffed runs up the middle that had no chance from the start. Johnson could have done a better job of being creative in these spots, especially with a quarterback like Caleb Williams, who can be a weapon with his legs. When it's all said and done, Sunday could prove to be a valuable learning experience for Johnson for the future. As it stands, this was a rough way for his season to end after doing so much good to get the franchise to this point.

While his touchdown throw to Cole Kmet that eventually sent the game to overtime will go down as another one of his signature special throws in a season full of them, that play doesn't quite make up for the struggles that Caleb Williams had for large portions of the evening.

Williams' stat line makes his overall performance look worse than it was, but it was still an uneven game for the Iceman in a cold, windy environment. Williams finished the game going 23-42 for 257 yards with 2 touchdowns but also 3 interceptions. Some of those interceptions were not fully on Williams, including his final interception, which was mostly the fault of DJ Moore (more on him later). With that said, it was an uncharacteristically rough day for Williams when it came to protecting the ball, as he finished with 4 turnover-worthy plays according to PFF's tracking. After a strong first half, Williams also went cold for most of the second half, which played a big role in the Rams taking back momentum and retaking the lead in the fourth quarter.

All-in-all, Williams deserves a ton of credit for his clutch play, but it would not have been needed had it not been for his struggles earlier in the game. Still, there is a lot for Williams to build on heading into the offseason, as this postseason will hopefully only be the beginning of more to come in his career.

Williams was not the only reason why the passing game was spotty on Sunday, as the receiving group as a whole struggled to play up to their standards. This was a game where nobody was absolved from blame, as pretty much every receiver made a critical mistake at some point. In particular, this group really struggled to catch the ball. Rome Odunze, Colston Loveland and Luther Burden were all credited with one drop each, but I think this undersells the issues that this group had with coming down with the catches. Odunze's struggles in particular stood out, as he failed to come down with what would have been a touchdown on the first drive of the game. DJ Moore also made a critical error leading to the final interception, as he appeared to run the wrong route on the play with questionable effort as well. Given how much has been invested in the receivers over the last few years, this simply was not the performance that the Bears needed from them with the season in the balance.",https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/826/355/13355826.jpg?width=1200&height=628&crop=1.91:1&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-21 05:59:23.976660

Charbonnet injured his knee during Saturday night’s 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC divisional round.

“He’s got a significant knee injury, unfortunately,” Macdonald said on Seattle Sports 710 on Monday. “Breaks your heart. He’s going to need surgery, so he’s got a good long road to come back. Our heart goes out to him, prayers go out to Charbs. We love him, man.”

During the regular season, Charbonnet led the Seahawks with 12 rushing touchdowns, as well as added 730 yards, which trailed only Kenneth Walker III for the team lead.

Charbonnet became the first Seahawks running back since Marshawn Lynch in 2014 to rush for at least 10 touchdowns in a season.

Walker, whose three rushing touchdowns against the 49ers tied him with Shaun Alexander for the most in a playoff game in franchise history, is the only healthy running back on Seattle’s roster. The Seahawks could add either of veteran running backs Velus Jones Jr. or Cam Akers from the practice squad, as well as George Holani, who has been on injured reserve since late November.

Regardless, the Seahawks will be without Charbonnet ahead of their NFC championship game matchup against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.

“This guy is the epitome of what it means to be a Seahawk,” Macdonald said. “Absolute tough as nails, great teammate, great human being, plays his tail off, detail oriented, unselfish. It just hurts, man, it hurts that it’s going on, but he’s going to be back stronger than ever, and the guys are going to pick him up.”",https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/dailyrecordnews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/2d/52da814d-8a9f-4409-a93b-49d83b7d02ba/696ea67c7f1af.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2026-01-21 05:59:30.495813

Green Bay released the cornerback and announced the move among a batch of forward-facing roster changes that included a pair of futures contracts. Diggs is now subject to waivers. If he clears them, which is likely, he'll be a free agent.

A six-year NFL veteran, Diggs latched on with the Packers at the end of the 2025 regular season, starting in their finale at Minnesota and recording two tackles before playing one snap in Green Bay's Wild Card Weekend loss to Chicago.

Diggs made his way to Green Bay only after Dallas abruptly parted ways with the former All-Pro defender in late December in a move that was reportedly the culmination of multiple factors over time, including performance and other components. The decision came less than three years after the Cowboys signed Diggs to a five-year, $97 million extension that preceded a season-ending ACL injury in 2023 and a tumultuous journey that followed both on and off the field.

Diggs' contract -- a lucrative agreement that became a bloated one due to his lack of production -- already placed him on a track to be released after the 2025 season. Instead of waiting for the offseason, the Cowboys decided to cut ties in December, freeing Diggs to join a title-contending squad with the expectation he'd likely be released by his new team after their season ended.

Green Bay did exactly that on Tuesday, freeing up the entirety of the $15 million he was scheduled to account for in cap space in 2026. Diggs faces an uncertain future as heads to free agency, but will have a head start on finding a new home prior to the start of the new league year in March.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/nm94oj8kpxpfztwmegbh,N,,2026-01-21 01:58:31.822798

We were kind of just sitting in our offensive line room reminiscing about the season.
“It felt like a frustrating season — especially on offence, we just couldn’t click, couldn’t mesh together for some reason.
“It’s great that Marty (Costello)’s going to be back coaching us as an offensive line.
I think it’ll just be a true commitment to executing and getting the job done on game day.”","Canadian offensive lineman Patrick Neufeld was unable to play the second half of the East Semi-Final due to a nasty injury he opened up about after signing a one-year contract extension to return to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for 2026.

“It was a kidney injury. I recovered a loose ball in the first quarter there and one of the Montreal defenders going for the ball hit me in the lower back. I didn’t know it at the time — I was in pain, but I just kind of thought it was like one of those hits in football. He must have hit me right in the kidney,” he told the media on Monday.

“At halftime, I was just urinating the wrong colour, let’s say, and immediately got our trainer Al (Couture) to assess everything. The next thing you know, that was the end of my day. It was just super unfortunate. Another huge reason why I wanted to come back was because I just felt like I couldn’t go out like that and need to redeem myself.”

Winnipeg had a miserable start to the East Semi-Final, falling behind 25-6 to the Montreal Alouettes by halftime. Backup blocker Tui Eli took over for Neufeld at right guard to start the third quarter and the team hit the ground running, scoring 21 unanswered points in seven minutes to take a 27-25 lead.

The Blue Bombers were unable to maintain the lead, losing to the eventual East Division champions by a score of 42-33. Neufeld never reentered the game, which may have been his last had his contract extension with the team not worked out.

“I just couldn’t return. It was just one of those organ kind of things where you’ve got to make sure you’re looking out for your health more than anything,” said Neufeld. “It was about two weeks of pretty solid pain and I can tell you guys for sure you want to stay away from kidney injury because it doesn’t feel great.”

The offensive line never made an appearance on locker room clean out day, which occurred shortly after Winnipeg’s playoff loss. Neufeld, who recently turned 37, didn’t speak to the media, nor did veteran stalwart left tackle Stanley Bryant.

According to the native of Regina, Sask., he and his fellow offensive linemen chose not to speak because they were still processing a whirlwind year.

“I think it was just a sentiment of feeling upset and frustrated with how our season ended. Me personally not getting to play the second half of that game was really disappointing, just with the hit that I took and the injury that happened,” said Neufeld.

“We just wanted to be in the room with the guys. It’s a business of change, so you never know who’s not going to be back in that offensive line room. We were kind of just sitting in our offensive line room reminiscing about the season. It was not an airing of grievances, but just talking about the season — the good, the bad, the ugly, the fun, all that.”

The Blue Bombers have already started making changes, recently releasing pending free-agent centre Chris Kolankowski, who has already landed with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

Neufeld indicated he was surprised by the move, calling Kolankowski one of his best friends. He expects Eli to take over the starting job at centre, while also speaking positively about young offensive linemen Gabe Wallace and Ethan Vibert. He also wants to see pending free-agent Bryant return, indicating he speaks regularly with the 39-year-old future Hall of Fame inductee.

Winnipeg has already made a key change to its coaching staff, hiring Tommy Condell as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. In a corresponding move, Jason Hogan was demoted to his old role of running backs coach.

“It felt like a frustrating season — especially on offence, we just couldn’t click, couldn’t mesh together for some reason. I think we were for whatever reason on different pages and that made that made it frustrating,” said Neufeld. “We just weren’t playing to the standard that we felt like, so I think everyone this offseason is kind of taking it to heart, the guys who are coming back, and want to make a statement that’s not the team going forward that we were in the past.”

“It’s about executing and playing better, that’s the bottom line. It’s about production and that’s just on executing. There’s a lot of elements that go into execution that we’re going to have to focus on. I think there’s going to just be kind of a renewed sense of fire, I think it’ll be refreshing having a new offensive coordinator, but having still part of our staff who’ve been around for a long time.

“It’s great that Marty (Costello)’s going to be back coaching us as an offensive line. He’s a tremendous coach for our group and has led us for the last number of years and I don’t know if there’s an offensive line coach who works harder on preparing us and getting us ready for game day, so we should be excited to have him still here and to be playing for him. I think it’ll just be a true commitment to executing and getting the job done on game day.”",https://cdn.3downnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/RPS08469-scaled-e1736097542702.jpg,N,,2026-01-21 05:59:37.165702

During their 33-30 victory over the Buffalo Bills, Bo Nix suffered a broken ankle in the final minutes of his first NFL playoff game, but Nix is maintaining his bold witness for Jesus Christ just like former Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow.

Nix and Tebow are the only quarterbacks drafted in Broncos franchise history to win playoff games, which last happened for Denver in 2011, according to Broncos Wire.

Outspoken about their Christian faith, Nix and Tebow also shone as quarterbacks in the SEC before arriving in Denver in the 2023 and 2010 NFL drafts, respectively.

Though not drafted by the Broncos, another courageous believer in Denver's winning history, quarterback Peyton Manning was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts before playing in the Mile High City.

With the mix of good and bad news about Nix following the win over the Bills, Tebow and Manning applaud him for leading the Broncos to the playoffs and are wishing him well during ankle surgery on Tuesday in Alabama.

The fracture ended a run to Super Bowl 60 for Nix.

Before hearing the bad news from Bronco's medical staff, Head Coach Sean Payton learned his second-year star quarterback had fractured his right ankle after Nix's wife, Izzy, posted a disheartening picture on social media.

""I snuck this picture because I wanted to remember this moment forever,"" Izzy wrote on Instagram. ""The joy, followed by the heartbreak, followed by watching each teammate and coach come to this little corner and sit by Bo's side. God could have placed us anywhere, and I'm so grateful He chose Denver. He is the perfect Author of Bo's story, and we cannot wait to see what He has in store for this team — We'll be on the front row, cheering the loudest!!!"" wrote Izzy Nix.

She also shared two Bible verses, including 2 Corinthians 4:16-17* which encourages followers of Jesus to persevere in faith and hope during suffering.

In the photo posted by Izzy Nix, her husband is on the floor with quarterbacks Jarrett Stidham and Sam Ehlinger; and Patrick Nix, the father of Bo.

Observing the scene and learning the news about the season-ending injury, Coach Payton returned to a post-game press conference broadcast live by CBS Colorado.

""He's such a strong faith-based guy. He was sitting in the hallway with his family, and I went over, and we were all talking to him, and he knows God has a plan for him,"" said Payton, who believes faith will carry him to recovery.

Payton announced that Stidham, the Broncos' No. 2 quarterback, will replace Nix in the AFC Championship Game against New England on Sunday.

The 25-year-old Nix passed for 279 yards and three touchdowns with one pick in the overtime victory over the Bills.

Asked before the game about advice from family members, Nix said his mother always offers the best. ""She wants me to stay healthy, go out there and have fun, stay humble, do the right things, and be a good leader for my teammates. I think sometimes parents can put it in perspective for you, just once in a while, let you know there's more out there than football,"" Nix said.

In mid-season, following the Broncos' 44-24 win over the Dallas Cowboys, Nix said playing for an audience of One is what inspires him.

""I feel like I'm in a great spot. Jesus has given me the ability to do what I'm passionate about. I'm really grateful for that. Salvation belongs to Him. I don't go around worrying about what other people think,"" Nix told The Gazette.

Before being drafted by the Broncos, Nix also played in Oregon after transferring from Auburn. As an Oregon Duck, Nix was also quick to give praise to Jesus for his team's victories.",https://cbn.com/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/ap26017776458420.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 21:59:25.802681

And then there were four.

After the divisional round of the NFL playoffs produced some tantalizing football, we’re now down to the final four teams: the Denver Broncos and New England Patriots in the AFC in addition to the Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams in the NFC.

That leaves eight remaining units: four offenses and four defenses. All have their strengths, and all have their weaknesses, but who are the best and worst remaining units in the conference championship games?

1. Seattle Seahawks defense (84.8 PFF grade; 2nd in EPA, 3rd in success rate)

The Seahawks’ defense is the epitome of a modern NFL defense. It is hard-hitting, excellent against the run and pass, incredibly deep, and most importantly, it can line up however it wants. The Seahawks don’t let offenses decide what package they run. They dictate the game on their own terms. The Seahawks line up almost exclusively in nickel and dime packages, 75.3% and 16.5% of their snaps — and no team is in base formation less than the Seahawks’ defense (6.5%).

Mike Macdonald’s unit has been historically good in 2025. Its 84.8 PFF grade is third among all defenses, and they rank second in EPA per play and third in success rate. It also leads the league with an 89.8 PFF coverage grade. The Seahawks' greatness comes from the fact that they don’t do anything too much. They blitz at one of the lowest rates in the NFL, they run simulated pressures on 19.7% of their passing down snaps — 14th in the NFL — but continuously win with four up front and pressure opposing quarterbacks 41.6% of their dropbacks, the fifth-highest rate.

Even in coverage, the Seahawks are multiple in their looks, running Cover 3, Cover 6, Quarters, Cover 1 and Cover 2 at rates of 10.0% or higher. By definition, they’re a team that has the answers to all of the tests.

2. Los Angeles Rams offense (93.0 PFF grade; 1st in EPA, 1st in success rate)

The Rams’ offense stuttered against the Chicago Bears in the cold of Chicago in the divisional round, but make no mistake, this is the NFL's premier offense. Led by one of the best offensive innovators in the business in Sean McVay, the Rams have the highest PFF grade (93.0) among all offenses, leading the league in EPA per play and success rate. Whether it’s on the ground or through the air, the Rams can move the ball at will and score points in bunches.

Matthew Stafford (92.9 grade; first) has had a career-best season in 2025, completing 65.0% of his passes for 4,707 passing yards, 46 touchdowns and eight interceptions, as the Rams led the league in passing success rate. It’s Stafford’s connection with receiver Puka Nacua (96.1 grade; first) that gives the Rams their edge. Nacua caught a league-best 129 passes for 1715 yards and 10 touchdowns in the regular season, and the Rams averaged 1.166 EPA per play when Nacua caught the ball.

Even beyond Nacua, the Rams have plenty of options. Receiver Davante Adams (84.2 grade; 10th) led the NFL in regular-season touchdown catches and is one of the NFL's best red-zone threats. The Rams have compelling tight ends that can feature in the passing game and an excellent run game to complement the passing attack. Their 89.1 PFF run grade is fifth in the NFL.

3. Denver Broncos defense (78.7 PFF grade; 6th in EPA, 2nd in success rate)

The Broncos won the AFC West for the first time since 2015 and, in the process, clinched the top seed in the conference with a 14-3 record. Though their offense flashed at times, the defense led the charge with a 78.7 PFF grade as one of the best defenses in the NFL. Vance Joseph’s unit got after the quarterback more than any other unit in the NFL, sacking opposing quarterbacks 79 times in the regular season and pressuring them on 42.1% of their dropbacks, the league's second-highest rate.

The defense gets the job done by blitzing at the sixth-highest rate in the NFL and overwhelming offensive lines with number mismatches, but there are still heaps of talent across the defensive line. Edge defender Nik Bonitto (79.5 grade; 16th) finished the season with 18 sacks, the second-most, and 80 pressures, while interior defender Zach Allen (64.5 grade; 45th) led the team with 81 pressures.

They’re excellent in coverage, as cornerback Patrick Surtain II (70.3 grade; 27th) is arguably the NFL's best, while hard-hitting safety Talanoa Hufanga (68.3 grade; 36th), linebacker Dre Greenlaw (74.8 grade; 20th) and linebacker Alex Singleton (70.1 grade; 28th) make the Broncos an equally tough proposition against the run. All across the board, the Broncos are supremely talented.

4. Los Angeles Rams defense (87.6 PFF grade; 8th in EPA, 8th in success rate)

Not to be outdone by the offense, the Rams’ defense has played lights out in 2025 and carried the load on the rare occasions the offense couldn’t hold up its end of the bargain. Chris Shula has a unit that finished 27th in EPA per play in 2024 rolling this season, as the Rams’ defense has gone from a potentially promising group of players to one of the best defenses in the NFL. Its 87.6 PFF grade is first among all defenses while placing eighth in EPA per play allowed and success rate.

The Rams defense's improvement in 2025 can be attributed to a variety of reasons, but signing free agent interior defender Poona Ford (88.1 grade; fourth) has been one of the key ones. Ford has compiled a 78.7 PFF run-defense grade in 2025 and helped stuff opposing rushing attacks at the line of scrimmage with 25 stops, while third-year edge defender Byron Young (85.5 grade; 9th) is second in run stops among edge defenders.

The defensive line is where the Rams flash the most talent, and its 41.8% pressure rate is third in the NFL. Edge defender Jared Verse (79.7 grade; 14th) has 87 pressures in 2025, the fifth-most in the NFL, and having an elite edge rusher that can earn four or five pressures a game in the playoffs is a big boon for any defense looking to win a Super Bowl.

5. New England Patriots offense (83.4 PFF grade; 5th in EPA, 8th in success rate)

After barely two seasons, the Patriots have found their guy in quarterback Drake Maye (87.4 grade; fifth). Maye had a promising rookie season but has lifted off in Year 2 with Josh McDaniels as his play-caller, leading the NFL in completion percentage (70.6%) while throwing for 4,841 yards, 36 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. As of now, Maye is locked in a fight with Stafford for MVP honors and is quarterbacking one of the NFL’s best offenses.

The Patriots’ 83.4 PFF offense grade is third in the NFL, and it places fifth in EPA per play and eighth in success rate. The offense's real strength comes from Maye and the passing game. The Patriots lead the NFL in EPA per passing play, and Maye has been one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL at pushing the ball downfield. His 37 completions of 20-plus yards are the third-most in the NFL, and his 52.1% completion rate on those throws is third. Maye isn’t chucking and praying; he’s throwing the ball downfield with accuracy, and showing off one of the best arms in the NFL. On paper, the Patriots aren’t blessed with the best receiving talent. Receiver Stefon Diggs (85.5 grade; ninth) was the team’s big free-agent signing in the summer, and he’s caught 91 passes for 1,069 yards and five touchdowns this season, but receivers Kayshon Boutte (73.8 grade; 36th) and Demario Douglas (76.7 grade; 25th) have both stepped up to help elevate the passing attack.

The Patriots’ 73.0 PFF pass-blocking grade is fifth among offensive lines, too, as the unit is a key reason for the improvements up front, even if Maye has been sacked the second-most times in the NFL. Even after a slow start, the Patriots’ run game has been competent. Running backs Rhamondre Stevenson (76.3 grade; 20th) and TreVeyon Henderson (68.4 grade; 42nd) have combined for 36 rushes of 10-plus yards in 2025.

6. Seattle Seahawks offense (85.3 PFF grade; 11th in EPA, 10th in success rate)

The Seahawks have presented themselves as, potentially, the most well-rounded team in the NFL. The defense is a force-shattering unit full of talent, and though the offense doesn’t have that same depth of talent, it’s still one of the better offenses in the NFL. Its 85.3 PFF grade is second in the NFL, and the Seahawks rank 11th in EPA per play and 10th in success rate. Though they don’t live and die by Jaxon Smith-Njigba (92.8 grade; second), he’s the fulcrum of their world. Smith-Njigba broke out in his third season in the NFL, catching 119 passes for a league-best 1,793 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns, and he led the NFL with 16 catches of 20-plus yards.

The offense’s explosiveness remains its calling card, too. It has the sixth-most explosive plays in the NFL in 2025, and quarterback Sam Darnold (79.9 grade; ninth) has the highest completion percentage in the NFL on deep pass attempts (56.6%). In recent weeks, the rushing attack, which had started the season slowly, has picked up, too. Running back Kenneth Walker (90.7 grade; first) went nuclear in the 41-6 divisional round win, carrying the ball 19 times for 116 yards and three touchdowns while forcing four missed tackles and breaking off four rushes of 10-plus yards, earning a 90.6 grade. Losing his running mate, Zach Charbonnet (86.6 grade; third), to a torn ACL is a big blow for the Seahawks, but Walker could shine with more carries.

There’ll naturally be question marks about Darnold, who compiled a 73.5 grade in the win against the San Francisco 49ers, going up against a defense that’s had his number this season — Darnold has thrown six picks in two games against the Rams, notching a 48.4 grade, but offensive playcaller Klint Kubiak has done well to make life easier for Darnold, while the offensive line allows pressure on just 30.5% of the passing snaps.

7. New England Patriots defense (78.3 PFF grade; 4th in EPA, 15th in success rate)

The argument can be made that the Patriots’ defense has faced a schedule that’s been kind to it, as its 78.1 PFF grade is seventh in the NFL, and its fourth in EPA per play allowed and 15th in success rate. In their last two playoff games, the Patriots are second in EPA per play allowed and third in success rate, thanks to two excellent performances against the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans.

The Patriots are excellent up front, pressuring opposing quarterbacks at the seventh-highest rate in the NFL and have 46 sacks on the season. They’re not the greatest finishers, but the Patriots can win up front with power and speed, putting opposing quarterbacks under duress. Edge defender K’Lavon Chaisson (60.8 grade; 80th), in particular, has had a career year, generating a team-high 68 pressures and 12 sacks while seven separate defenders have at least 20 pressures on the season. The Patriots, as a unit, blitz at the 10th-highest rate in the NFL.

It’s not just up front where the Patriots win. Their 89.8 PFF coverage grade is the second-highest in the NFL, and cornerbacks Christian Gonzalez (72.3 grade; 21st) and Carlton Davis III (71.3 grade; 25th), as well as slot CB Marcus Jones (72.1 grade; 22nd), have been excellent in coverage, and the Patriots have allowed the 14th-fewest explosive passing plays in the NFL.

8. Denver Broncos offense (76.3 PFF grade; 12th in EPA, 21st in success rate)

Moments after their win against the Bills in the divisional round, the Broncos were handed the devastating news that quarterback Bo Nix (77.1 grade; 13th) would miss the rest of the postseason due to a fractured ankle. Nix had looked excellent in the 33-30 win against the Buffalo Bills, throwing for 279 yards, three touchdowns and an interception while earning an 80.1 grade. His loss is a massive blow for the Broncos, who will look to backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham to lead them to their first Super Bowl appearance since 2015.

Even with Nix, the Broncos offense still had its flaws. Its 76.3 PFF grade is 13th, and it is 12th in EPA per play, but it is 21st in success rate, and Nix has underwhelmed at times. His 22 turnover-worthy plays were the ninth-most in the NFL, and his 6.4 yards per attempt were 32nd out of 43 quarterbacks in 2025. Despite that, Nix had earned a 78.2 grade since Week 15. The drop off from Nix to Stidham, who earned a 55.5 grade in 2023 when he last started an NFL game, is concerning, but the Broncos have one of the best pass-blocking offensive lines in the NFL — its 79.1 grade leads the league — and head coach Sean Payton knows how to call a football game.

With Nix out of the picture, the Broncos are going to need to run the ball better. Their 78.4 PFF run grade is 18th in the NFL, and they’re 22nd in EPA per rushing play and 25th in rushing success rate.",https://media.pff.com/2025/12/Leonard-Williams-Week-15-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675,N,,2026-01-21 05:59:44.228589

Is this the end of Golden State’s storied dynasty, the one that even Steve Kerr acknowledged recently was fading? The rest of us could see that much from the other side of the Bay Bridge for years now, but it was something altogether different for one of their leaders to actually say it. Yet as Kerr knows as well as anyone from his “Last Dance” Chicago Bulls days, there’s no graceful way to get out of the ring-collecting business.

Monday night was a brutal reminder.

To see Jimmy Butler limp off the Chase Center court after tearing his right ACL in the third quarter against his old Miami Heat team was to wonder where the Warriors go from here. The 36-year-old forward was Robin to Steph Curry’s Batman, a mercurial talent whose two-way play elevated their program and — if they squinted hard enough — made Warriors officials believe that they could still be title contenders. Yes, this season.

Even after the Warriors’ slow start, and with all the drama surrounding the Jonathan Kuminga situation that now gets even more interesting as the Feb. 5 trade deadline nears, there was still a sense in Warriors circles that this group would ultimately be capable of making real noise when the playoffs rolled around. They had Butler playing at an All-Star level again in recent weeks, with Golden State’s win 135-112 over Miami making it 12 wins in 16 games after they started just 13-15 (they’re in eighth place in the West — 1 1/2 games behind the Lakers for the sixth spot).

Veteran forward De’Anthony Melton had recently returned from … a torn ACL … to star in his role and provide a serious spark. The improved play of old-head Al Horford was another significant factor. They felt they could become true contenders if they managed to stay healthy when it mattered most. And all of these goals — per their organizational norm — were a way of honoring Curry and his greatness, which should never be taken for granted.

But this Butler injury changes everything. Will Kerr rely on Kuminga, the 23-year-old with whom he has struggled for so long? It’s nearly impossible to imagine a basketball world where Kuminga becomes the savior. No, this — the loss of a proud star in his late 30s who is in the first year of a two-year, $112 million extension that he was given upon arrival when the Warriors traded for him last February — just might be their death knell. Especially considering Butler had a meniscus tear in that same knee in 2018 (which required surgery) and an MCL sprain in 2024.

Consider this much, too: Even if Kuminga decides to play ball, so to speak, we’ve already seen the limits of that particular approach. He did his best in the Western Conference semifinals last postseason after a Game 1 hamstring injury ended Curry’s season. Kuminga averaged 24.3 points on 55.4 percent shooting in 31 minutes per game, and … the Warriors still lost in five games. That’s a cautionary tale if ever there was one.

What’s more, it’s worth noting that Kuminga was the only active Warriors player not to play against the Heat Monday, despite them being without Draymond Green, Melton and Butler (after his injury). That speaks volumes.

If nothing else, Kuminga should be motivated by the fact that his value is not what he or his agent, Aaron Turner, believed it to be. All indications are that the Sacramento Kings remain the only legitimate suitor for his services, and they lowered their offer recently (refusing to include a protected first-round pick) because of the Warriors’ sordid state of affairs.

You never know what might shake loose as the deadline nears, and it’s safe to assume that longtime owner Joe Lacob and general manager Mike Dunleavy will get even more aggressive in their pursuit of roster upgrades. But team sources say the phones are simply not ringing for Kuminga’s services at this point.

Here’s an idea to pass the time: Kuminga, who has every right to be frustrated by the way in which his Warriors situation has evolved, should compartmentalize all of that angst and prove his worth to the league in these coming weeks. After all, Golden State did give him a two-year, $48.5 million deal last summer, with a team option for next season and the overall impression that services would be rendered.

When Kerr was asked if Kuminga might finally see the floor in the wake of Butler’s injury, he said, “Absolutely.” He was then asked if he was ready.

“Yep, yep,” Kerr said.

Now is the time to deliver — so long as Kerr calls his number. Their almost-dead dynasty depends on it.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/20073813/USATSI_28042988-1-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-20 21:59:32.660405

Super Bowl odds barely budge

The Divisional Round didn’t change the Super Bowl odds board much, at least at the very top.

With four teams left, the Seahawks remain the favorites (+145, FanDuel Sportsbook) to win it all after they drubbed the 49ers.

After their win over the Bears, the Rams are still right behind Seattle (+210), followed by the Patriots (+240).

The biggest shift came in Denver after Bo Nix’s injury, which we will have more on here in a minute.

The Broncos now have, by far, the longest odds to hoist the Lombardi Trophy (+1300).

The Bo Nix effect

About that Bo Nix injury.

The Broncos quarterback shockingly went down with a broken ankle, ending his season with his team just two wins away from a Super Bowl title.

Oddsmakers, apparently, really don’t like the downgrade from Nix to backup Jarrett Stidham.

The Broncos went from a 1.5-point lookahead favorite before the news of Nix’s injury broke, shifting the odds in the Patriots’ favor despite having to travel to the Mile High City.

The line shifted to as high as -5.5 for New England as of Tuesday afternoon.

If that number holds, the Patriots would be the biggest road favorite during the conference championship round since the merger (1970).

But that was far from the only news on Tuesday.

General manager Joe Schoen spoke with the media following Harbaugh's press conference, where he provided updates on the injury status of wide receiver Malik Nabers and running back Cam Skattebo.

Nabers suffered a torn ACL during the team's Week 4 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, an injury that cost him the rest of the season. While Schoen wouldn't say anything definitively about the timetable for the young wideout's return, the general manager did say Nabers looks like he could be ready for the start of camp.

""Malik is trending to hopefully be ready for training camp,"" Schoen added. ""Things can change ... but that's the hope.""

The injury occurred with 6:12 left in the second quarter of Jaxson Dart's first career start under center. Nabers had two receptions for 20 yards on three targets up to that point.

In his four games, the young receiver totaled 18 receptions for 271 yards, including his explosive 167-yard, two-touchdown performance against the Cowboys in Week 2.

Nabers enjoyed a historic rookie campaign in 2024 as he set a new franchise single-season reception record on his way to being named to the Pro Bowl. He finished his rookie season with 109 receptions for 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns.

While Harbaugh said he has not had the chance to meet Nabers in person over the last week, the two were able to connect over the phone, where the 22-year-old made a strong first impression on his new head coach.

""I had a chance to talk to Malik on the phone,"" Harbaugh said after the press conference. ""It was great. He was training out in LA, rehabbing out there for a week or whatever it was and working hard. I just love talking to him. His joy and excitement, he had some really good ideas, he's really a thoughtful guy. Obviously, saw him coming out (of LSU). He wasn't a guy we had a chance for, so it was like, 'Well, look at this guy, he's really good.' Just kind of a dream. I figured we might have to cover him someday, and here we are, we get a chance to coach him. So I'm really excited about it.""

As for Skattebo, the young running back is on track to be ready for the start of the Giants' offseason workout program in the spring.

""He'll be fine,"" Schoen said about the 23-year-old running back. ""He'll actually be prepared for the offseason program on April 6th. He should be good.""

Skattebo suffered a dislocated ankle in Week 8 when the Giants were on the road in Philadelphia. The young back underwent successful surgery that night at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital Presbyterian campus and was discharged the next day.

""That's not even a question,"" Skattebo said after the season ended on whether or not he would return to 100 percent. ""I'm going to be back. I've played seven games in the NFL and I got hurt. There's a long road ahead. That is not going to stop me.""

In his limited action this past season, Skattebo ran the ball 101 times for 410 yards (4.1 avg.) and five touchdowns. He also played a big role in the passing game, catching 24 passes for 207 yards and another two scores.

Despite missing the second half of the season, Skattebo stayed around the team as he rehabbed his ankle, providing the sideline with the same energy he brought on the field prior to the injury.

""It sucked because you can't be out there to help,"" Skattebo told reporters on January 5. ""When you can't do something to make sure that your team is in a better position to win or you can't contribute at all other than having the energy on the sidelines and making sure the guys in the building have a positive mindset, it's hard to be in that situation. But I tried to take it as best as I could.""

A couple of weeks after his surgery, Skattebo made an appearance with some teammates on WWE 'Monday Night Raw' at Madison Square Garden. Skattebo had some back-and-forth banter during the skit, which led to him shoving wrestler JD McDonagh from behind a steel barrier and getting pushed back.

The appearance was all in fun and Skattebo was not actually put in harm's way. While Schoen did admit he would have preferred it if the injured back did not participate in the skit, the GM acknowledged that at the end of the day, Skatt is going to be Skatt.

""I was sitting on my couch at home, I had no idea what was going on and the agent called me,"" Schoen said about the WWE appearance. ""I would rather him not do that, but as you guys that have been around Skatt (know), that's just who he is.""

The running back certainly found his own ways to showcase his personality while injured. But he made it clear the day after the season ended that once he's healthy enough to get back on the field, the sole focus will turn back to football.

""Obviously, the main thing is football, so I'll get back to that when I'm ready to go. It's football from there on out,"" he said.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/giants/avw1lsgh3qoarwzli9qr,N,,2026-01-20 18:00:51.650996

The Browns linebacker was voted NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year by the Pro Football Writers of America, it was announced Tuesday. He’s the favorite to be named Associated Press Defensive Rookie of the Year at NFL Honors on Feb. 5.

Schwesinger is the first Browns player to win the award since the PFWA established it in 1974.

He was joined on the PFWA All-Rookie team by defensive tackle Mason Graham.

Schwesinger was the No. 33 pick out of UCLA, where he began his career as a walk-on and started only one season. He immediately impressed Browns coaches and teammates and was inserted in the starting lineup. When veteran Jordan Hicks retired at the start of training camp, Schwesinger became the signal caller.

He started 16 games — he missed the finale with a quadriceps injury — and led NFL rookies with 146 tackles and 11 tackles for loss. The total tackles ranked eighth in the league. He added two interceptions, 2.5 sacks and three passes defensed.

He had double-digit tackles in seven games, including six straight, the longest streak in the league this season. The seven double-digit-tackle games were the most among rookies.

Myles Garrett voted All-NFL by Pro Football Writers of America for sixth straight season

He was the only linebacker in the league with at least 11 tackles for loss and two interceptions.

He was voted a Pro Bowl alternate.

“He’s playing at a really high level,” safety Grant Delpit said during the season. “And it’s no secret, everybody knows it.

“I saw it early, I ain’t going to lie. I saw early at camp, I think everybody saw. We knew that he was going to be around the ball a lot. He’s around that ball, so it’s inspiring. Makes everybody else want to make plays, too.”

Schwesinger played through a high ankle sprain throughout the second half of the season, earning even more respect from coaches and teammates.

“It’s really been an honor to coach that kid,” defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, who’s a candidate for the head coaching job, said during the final week of the season. “It’s easy for me, but he’s done everything — and he’s played extremely tough, going back to the ankle sprain. But he’s been all over the injury report. He prepares the same, he goes out and plays effectively.

“And he’s been a good leader for us — he’s increased that as the season’s gone on, and I look forward to seeing him even take greater strides as a player. Really a cement block for our defense and I think Defensive Rookie of the Year.”

Graham was the No. 5 pick out of Michigan. He started all 17 games, compiling 48 tackles, including seven for loss, a half-sack, four quarterback hits and four passes defensed.

The Browns defense ranked fourth in the NFL in yards allowed and third in passing yards.

Running back Quinshon Judkins, the No. 36 pick out of Ohio State, was a strong candidate after rushing for 827 yards and seven touchdowns in 14 games, but New England’s TreVeyon Henderson and Las Vegas’ Ashton Jeanty were picked for the All-Rookie team. Henderson and Judkins were teammates at Ohio State.

This is where Bo Nix chose to rest, finally, on Jan. 17. Slumped with his arms across his chest on the floor, still in a crumpled Broncos jersey and his gameday eye black, with his left sock on and right sock off. Processing. A small group formed around him, growing and thinning in size, Nix’s wife, Izzy, capturing the moment and sharing it to Instagram. Quarterbacks coach Davis Webb took a seat against the wall next to him. QB3 Sam Ehlinger watched. QB2 Jarrett Stidham watched.

Eventually, as not pictured by Izzy Nix, 315-pound right tackle Mike McGlinchey wandered over and sat next to his quarterback, too.

“I think he was made to handle things like this,"" McGlinchey told reporters Monday. ""He’s as tough as they come. And he’ll be back better than ever, when it’s all said and done.”

It hurts, McGlinchey reflected. Nix's season was done in the snap of an ankle bone, a freefall off an emotional mountaintop after leading the Broncos to a 33-30 overtime win over Buffalo in the AFC divisional round Saturday. Nix and McGlinchey are close. So are wives Izzy and Brooke. McGlinchey has texted Nix a ""bunch"" in the two days since, the tackle said.

But there is no time to mourn. The AFC's No. 2-seeded New England Patriots and MVP candidate Drake Maye loom on the immediate horizon. This Broncos locker room finds itself in the strangest of all places -- the future of the franchise suddenly ripped away, and having to step into an immediate future without him.

“I wouldn’t say it’s just another test, right,"" McGlinchey said. ""Like, you don’t ever say that about guys getting hurt. I think, especially when it’s the leader and the quarterback of your team, there’s a little bit more nuance to that.

""But certainly, we are a team that’s been battle-tested.”

The next test: to coalesce around the locker closest to the trainer's room, the one the 29-year-old Stidham calls home. Game-planning for New England without Nix will be tough. Adjusting Sean Payton's offense to Stidham's strengths in one week will be tough. But as both McGlinchey and defensive tackle Zach Allen indicated Monday, rallying around career backup Stidham is a fairly easy task.

""I have no doubts that he’s going to go out there and play his butt off,"" McGlinchey said Monday. ""And I think our team is in a perfect position with Stiddy moving forward, and we’re lucky to have him.

""And we’re lucky that our team, and our coaching staff and our front office, invests in every situation that could possibly come up on a football field, because not everybody has a quarterback waiting in the wings as talented as Jarrett.”

Stidham, as McGlinchey said, has been waiting for a moment like Sunday ""the entirety of his career."" He waited behind Tom Brady in his final year in New England -- and Stidham's rookie year -- in 2019. He lost a quarterback battle to Cam Newton in 2020. He played insurance for Derek Carr in Las Vegas in 2022. He lost a quarterback battle to Nix in Denver in 2024. Six years have come and gone with only four NFL starts to show for it.

And yet the man's made good money for good reason. He signed in Denver for two years and $10 million in 2023 to back up Russell Wilson, and signed for two years and $12 million this past offseason to back up Nix. Multiple Broncos sources have expressed clear conviction in Stidham to The Denver Post, a feeling outwardly shared by players.

""He’s like a second quarterback coach out there,"" Allen said. ""And on top of it, too, he can make every single throw.”

""He’s more prepared than anybody would be in this situation,"" McGlinchey said. ""And he can ball. Like, he can flat-out play quarterback. And we’ve seen it every single day of practice.""

Will this be an easy transition in pure Xs and Os? No. Payton made clear Monday that Nix takes the majority of reps on any given work week, with limited game-feel situations for Stidham.

Still, they will ride behind his No. 8 jersey, because there is currently no other option.

“He’ll be ready to go,"" Payton said Monday, ""and ready for the moment.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tdp-z-refer-02_64c2d5.jpg?w=1024&h=691,N,,2026-01-20 18:00:56.659358

After suffering multiple injuries at wide receiver, the Denver Broncos are bringing back a familiar face ahead of the AFC Championship game.

The Broncos are signing receiver Brandon Johnson to their practice squad, KUSA-TV's Mike Klis first reported on Tuesday. Denver will need to make a corresponding move to make room for Johnson.

Johnson (6-2, 195 pounds) originally entered the league with the Broncos as an undrafted free agent out of UCF in 2022. After hauling in six receptions for 42 yards and one touchdown in seven appearances as a rookie, Johnson's role expanded under new coach Sean Payton in 2023 as he totaled 19 catches for 284 yards and four touchdowns in 13 games.

Johnson failed to make Denver's 53-man roster following training camp in 2024 and he landed on the Pittsburgh Steelers' practice squad. He made three appearances that season, grabbing one catch for nine yards. After being cut by the Steelers in August, Johnson spent most of the 2025 season on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' practice squad.

After being cut by the Bucs in December, Johnson returned to Pittsburgh's practice squad. Because he was not on an active roster at the end of the Steelers' season, Johnson was eligible to join the Broncos after his practice squad contract expired in Pittsburgh.

Pat Bryant suffered his second concussion in less than a month during Saturday's divisional round win over the Buffalo Bills and Troy Franklin left the game with a hamstring injury. Following those injuries, the Broncos were down to three healthy WRs on the active roster: Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims and Lil'Jordan Humphrey.

“It’s not as bad as other ones.” Another top-end player feeling optimistic about his recovery was Fred Warner.

Both are de facto team MVP awards, with the Eshmont being voted on by players and the Walsh by coaches.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. — George Kittle was supine on the Eagles’ sideline on Jan. 11 when Philadelphia’s trainer knelt beside him and asked what he needed.

“I need a cart,” Kittle said. “I’m not going to be able to walk this one off.”

The San Francisco 49ers tight end knew immediately he’d torn his right Achilles tendon after making a 6-yard catch midway through the second quarter. Kittle said it “felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger.”

Despite the early end to his season and a months-long rehabilitation ahead, Kittle was his usual jokey, upbeat self after pushing his knee scooter to the middle of a media scrum on locker clean-out day Monday.

He said his tear was a best-case scenario, one that occurred higher up on the tendon near the soleus muscle, where there’s better blood flow and thus the chance for a faster-than-normal recovery.

“I had a clean tear,” he said, “They didn’t have to drill into my heel. And where the repair was, there’s more blood flow. So it takes some time off the recovery time.”

Kittle declined to give a specific timeline, but a quick recovery from an Achilles tear has traditionally been around eight months, which would put him in play for the start of the regular season.

Some NFL Achilles patients come back even faster than that. Former 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree, for example, returned in six months. One-time Los Angeles Rams runner Cam Akers’ recovery took five and a half months.

“It puts me in a really good mood,” Kittle said. “It’s not as bad as other ones.”

Another top-end player feeling optimistic about his recovery was Fred Warner.

The linebacker said last week’s well-reported return to the practice field went very well, so much so that he was confident he’d have been able to play in this Sunday’s NFC Championship Game had the 49ers won Saturday.

“Which gives me the ultimate confidence going forward into the offseason, to just attack things as hard as I can,” he said. “Because there are no limitations.”

Warner said he didn’t need any follow-up surgeries on his ankle, which he broke and dislocated on Oct. 12, and that he’d continue to rehabilitate the muscles around the ankle, albeit at a more moderate pace than last week.

“I think my rehab got super-accelerated to try to make that NFC Championship Game, so now I get to kind of slow things down and just really just work on all the little things that I didn’t get to work on before all this happened,” he said.

Quarterback Brock Purdy also said he wouldn’t need any procedures on the turf toe injury that caused him to miss eight games in 2025, declaring the toe “good to go.” Even defensive end Mykel Williams, who tore his ACL as well as his lateral meniscus on Nov. 2, was optimistic about being ready for the regular season, saying Monday he “should” be back in time for the start of training camp.

The first-round draft pick said he’s been leaning on advice from position mate Nick Bosa, who tore his ACL six weeks earlier, the third time he’s had such an injury.

“Because he’s been through it,” Williams said. “He knows exactly what it feels like and how to move.”

Kittle, meanwhile, said he’s been buoyed by all the well-wishers who contacted him after his injury. That group includes quarterback Kirk Cousins and former cornerback Richard Sherman as well as Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton, who tore his Achilles in June in Game 7 of the NBA Finals.

Kittle, a massive wrestling fan, said he also fielded a call from former wrestler Bill Goldberg.

“That was a cool experience for me,” Kittle said.

Odds and ends

• Receiver Jauan Jennings, who’s scheduled to hit free agency, became nostalgic when asked about the prospect of signing with another team.

“(When) I first flew in here, I was thinking I was going to San Francisco just like everybody else,” he said. “And then you find out fast it’s Santa Clara. Now it’s home. It quickly turned into home, and a run I’ll never forget for sure.”

Jennings led the 49ers’ wide receivers in receiving yards (643) and receiving touchdowns (nine) this season.

• Defensive coordinator Robert Saleh interviewed in-person for the Tennessee Titans’ head coach job Monday and by late Monday evening was finalizing a deal to become their next head coach. With Saleh leaving, his heir apparent appears to be his mentor, Gus Bradley, who served as assistant head coach for the 49ers this season and who had a prominent role as storyteller at the day-before-game team meetings in 2025.

“For years, I heard Saleh telling those same stories,” Warner said. “(Bradley’s) been doing it for such a long time, and he’s been great to have.”

• Christian McCaffrey, who led the NFL in touches and was second in yards from scrimmage, won both the 49ers’ Len Eshmont and Bill Walsh awards. Both are de facto team MVP awards, with the Eshmont being voted on by players and the Walsh by coaches.

Seahawks lose RB Charbonnet to ‘significant’ knee injury

If he’s able to return, Holani would provide some much-needed running back depth for the Seahawks, who will be without second-leading rusher Zach Charbonnet for the rest of their playoff run. Charbonnet tore his ACL in the second quarter of Seattle’s 41-6 rout of the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Divisional Round on Saturday night.

Holani has been on injured reserve since Nov. 29 after suffering a hamstring injury in Seattle’s Week 12 win over the Tennessee Titans.

“George is an option, yeah,” Macdonald said. “We’ll see how it goes this week.”

Prior to his injury, Holani spent the first 11 games of the season as Seattle’s third-string running back behind Kenneth Walker III and Charbonnet.

An undrafted second-year pro out of Boise State, Holani rushed for 73 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries this season, while adding two catches for 15 yards. He also had 16 kick returns for 387 yards.

Walker and Charbonnet spent the season as a formidable one-two punch in Seattle’s backfield. Walker rushed for a team-high 1,027 yards and five touchdowns, while Charbonnet ran for 730 yards and a team-high 12 TDs.

How Zach Charbonnet’s injury impacts the Seahawks

Walker is currently the only healthy running back on Seattle’s 53-man roster. However, the Seahawks also have fourth-year pro Velus Jones Jr. and sixth-year pro Cam Akers on their practice squad.

Jones was elevated from the practice squad for Saturday night’s divisional round game and rushed for 10 yards on six carries after Charbonnet went down. Jones, who signed with Seattle’s practice squad midway through the season, ran for 32 yards on four carries in three regular-season games.

Akers signed with the Seahawks in late-November after getting released by the Minnesota Vikings. He spent his first three-plus seasons with the Rams, finishing as their leading rusher in both 2020 and 2022. He has no carries with Seattle this season, but had two kick returns for 54 yards in a Week 17 win over the Carolina Panthers.

Here are three betting storylines for the NFL’s final four, with odds from BetMGM:

How Bo Nix’s injury affected the line

It’s impossible to discuss the AFC championship game without a dive into the Broncos’ quarterback conundrum.

Broncos coach Sean Payton shocked everyone with the announcement that Bo Nix would undergo season-ending surgery, meaning Jarrett Stidham would start the AFC championship game. Stidham will set the record for fewest career starts (four) of any starting quarterback in NFL conference championship game history.

There was a huge adjustment to the line. On lookahead lines for potential matchups last week, the Broncos were a 1.5-point favorite over the Patriots. That moved all the way to Patriots -5.5, but it has come back to Patriots -5 at BetMGM. The Broncos could close as the biggest home underdog in NFL conference championship game history.

Before the season, 12 oddsmakers broke down the point-spread difference between starting quarterback and backup quarterback for each team to Yahoo Sports’ Ben Fawkes, and the average difference from Nix and Stidham was 3.85 points. The line actually moved 6.5 points, based on that lookahead line, which seems like an overreaction.

Seahawks favored over Rams

The NFC championship game is the third meeting between the Seahawks and Rams this season, which means we have point spread history for two other games.

In the first meeting in Los Angeles, the Rams were 3-point favorites and won but didn’t cover, outlasting Seattle 21-19 when the Seahawks missed a long field goal as time expired. In the second game, the Seahawks were 1.5-point favorites and trailed by 16 points in the fourth quarter before coming back to win but not cover in a wild 38-37 win.

The line this time has moved the Seahawks’ way, even though their win over the Rams was fluky with a historic comeback. Seattle is -2.5 at -120 odds, which means it could move to Seahawks -3 before kickoff. The Seahawks’ rest over the last two weeks, with a bye followed by a blowout win over the 49ers, might factor in. The Rams’ wild-card game came down to the final minute and then the divisional round game at Chicago went to overtime. The Seahawks have also looked impressive in the three games since that comeback over the Rams, while Los Angeles hasn’t played a great game since then.

Both of these teams have been good to bettors. The Seahawks and Rams both went 12-5 against the spread this regular season, in a four-way tie for the best ATS record in the NFL, according to Action Network (the Patriots and Jaguars were the others).

NFC likely to be favored in Super Bowl

As has been the case for weeks, the two NFC West teams are atop the Super Bowl odds. No matter which NFC team wins Sunday, they’re very likely to be favored in Super Bowl LX.

The Broncos’ quarterback situation has also affected the current Super Bowl odds:

Seahawks +150

Rams +220

Patriots +250

Broncos +1300

It is a bit jarring to see Jarrett Stidham at +2000 to win Super Bowl MVP, considering he hasn’t thrown a pass in either of the last two regular seasons and wasn’t on anyone’s radar just a few days ago.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ka9F2ozaNnuwHPPfDfelmw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/d2cfc31a-7baf-425a-b863-cd18e2e05e94,N,,2026-01-20 17:00:53.027078

Fernando Mendoza, born in Miami and the grandson of Cuban immigrants, chose a different path: American football – a decision that has carried him to the top of college football and positioned him as the leading candidate to be the No. 1 pick in next year’s NFL Draft.

The quarterback for theIndiana Hoosiersled his team to an undefeated season and the national championship after beating theMiami Hurricanes. He also claimed theHeisman Trophy, given to the best player in college football. Mendoza finished the regular season with 2,980 passing yards, 33 touchdown passes and six interceptions.

Although he has lived his entire life in the United States, Mendoza is proud of his Cuban roots through his grandparents, who taught him the value of perseverance and hard work – principles he applies every day. He says he admires Cuba’s sporting tradition in other disciplines, but wants to inspire island communities to embrace American football as well.

“My idea was to be able to broaden the horizon and show different Cuban communities that it’s not only about boxing and baseball – sports we excel in and that I love,” he said in an interview with CNN. “I really enjoy watching those sports, but we can also play football and any other discipline we choose.”

History with the Heisman

By winning the Heisman, Mendoza matched Jim Plunkett, who has Mexican roots, as the only Latino players to have captured college football’s most prestigious individual award. “It’s definitely a huge honor to be part of the conversation, especially alongside so many great players from the past and great players in the conversation now,”he said. “I’ve always trusted my team and myself. Now I’m just trying to take it one game at a time, one practice at a time, so I have a clear vision to reach my biggest goals.”

Finally, in his acceptance speech, Mendoza paid tribute to his family, singling out his grandparents. “For the love and sacrifice of my parents and grandparents – I love you so much. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.”

George Kittle injury update

No additional tests were required for the 32-year-old to learn the extent of his injury, as Kittle said he knew right away after hitting the turf in the Eagles-49ers game that it was an Achilles tear.

""It felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger,"" he said. ""The second it happened, I knew exactly what it was. A Philadelphia trainer came down, a very nice guy, and said, 'What do you need?' I was like, 'I need a cart. [I'm] not gonna be able to walk this one off.'""

He also confirmed the rumor that he had a bottle of Patrón tequila sent to him by the 49ers' owner, Jed York, while he was in the locker room with medical staff.

""I did have both my parents and my wife in there too, so it's not like I was alone,"" he joked. ""I had supporters.""

Renowned surgeon Dr. Neal ElAttrache performed surgery on Kittle's Achilles in Los Angeles shortly after the Eagles game. Kittle said he was told the best-case scenario for an Achilles tear is that it occurs high near the soleus muscle, which is what happened in his case.

""Surgery went really, really good,"" Kittle said. ""I had a clean tear. They didn't have to drill into my heel, and where the repair was is where there's more blood flow, and so it takes some time off the recovery time. [ElAttrache] is really excited about my recovery... that puts me in a really good mood. It's not as bad as other ones.""

Kittle did not provide a timeline for his return, wishing to ""keep it as a surprise"" instead. He did not rule out a return in 2026, though, and ESPN reported Kittle saying he could be back out on the field ""well before November.""

For a professional athlete, recovery time for a torn Achilles tendon is typically 8-12 months.

Now that I have reclaimed my laptop, in a shockingly violent confrontation, from the clutches of Golden State's head coach, this blog is allowed to acknowledge the existence of Jonathan Kuminga, recently stranded in basketball purgatory.","Jimmy Butler's season is over. His painful-looking collapse in the third quarter of Golden State's win Monday night over the visiting Miami Heat was caused by the sudden kerplosion of his right ACL, a crisis that will require surgery and then many months of recovery. This stinks for Butler, who is now facing the most serious injury of his career during his age-36 season. Butler delivers and takes beatings, a consequence of his particular style of basketball, which aesthetically certainly is not for everyone. You have to grade durability on a curve: LaMelo Ball will miss 15 to 40 games per campaign due to having papier-maché ankles; Butler, meanwhile, played a solid majority of his team's games every season for 13 years despite deploying his own tender body every night as a bulldozer, a forklift, a wrecking ball, an excavator, a railway stopblock, and a grenade. That he made it this long without any ligaments shredding catastrophically should be a real point of pride.

Lately he'd been cooking pretty good, and the Warriors had won 12 of 16 games to climb up to eighth in the Western Conference, a season-best six games over .500. Even with Butler, the Warriors are desperately cramped for offensive space and reliable shot-creation. Of the players who have played at least half of Golden State's games this season, only Butler and Stephen Curry have posted usage rates over 20 percent, which does not seem like it should be possible and in any case cannot have been sustainable, not when those two players have a combined age of 73 years old. The next most engaged Warriors regular by usage, after Butler, is veteran DeAnthony Melton, who is working his way into form after missing the first month of the season while recovering from his own ACL injury; the next most engaged guy is reserve guard Pat Spencer, who despite Steve Kerr's sweaty insistence to the contrary is 100 percent not ""that motherfucker."" Across Golden State's last 11 games Spencer has scored a grand total of three points.

It would sure be a luxury if the Warriors had another talented scorer in reserve, preferably someone with the floor skills and in-between game to handle some of Butler's bruising creation duties, and the size to hold up at all when assigned to defend opposing swingmen. Unfortunately, such players nowadays cannot be had for less than, say, $22.5 million per season, an expenditure that would push a team with Golden State's other salary commitments deep into the luxury tax. Obviously you cannot expect the Warriors—a tax-repeater, and thus subject to an onerous tax multiplier— to have splurged on such a thing, and thus to now be on the hook for an estimated tax bill for this season of more than $81 million. Obviously, had they made such a bold commitment, the player would already be in Kerr's rotation, spelling Butler, absorbing an important share of the offense, and pushing washed-up bozo Buddy Hield to the very end of the bench. Especially if that player were just 23 years old, in good health, had cost the team a valuable lottery pick, and had averaged 21 points per game across the team's most recent playoff series. Frankly, I don't even know why we are still talking about this!

Ahem. Now that I have reclaimed my laptop, in a shockingly violent confrontation, from the clutches of Golden State's head coach, this blog is allowed to acknowledge the existence of Jonathan Kuminga, recently stranded in basketball purgatory. Kuminga—23 years old, healthy, acquired via the seventh pick in the 2021 NBA draft, and recently signed to an expensive two-year contract—fell out of Kerr's rotation back in November and has not touched the court once since Dec. 18. In late October, Kerr was up there gassing up Kuminga's development and affirming his security as a starter after an encouraging win; two weeks later Kuminga had devolved into a radioactive clump of dog turds, and could not be allowed to approach the court except in disaster scenarios. Kerr can't stand Kuminga, and Kuminga is a clunky fit with the team's ancient core, and the relationship is now so rotten that Kerr would rather dish opportunities at the likes of Will Richard and Gui Santos than give any burn at all to a guy who performed heroically for his team in a by-God playoff series just eight months ago.

The situation could not be much more awkward without one or both men having bits of spinach conspicuously lodged in their teeth. Kuminga, as a recent free-agent signing, did not become eligible for a trade until Jan. 15; that same day, he or his agents demanded that he be traded, and leaked the demand to Shams Charania of ESPN. Charania reported that everyone in the organization, including Kuminga's teammates, agreed that he should be shipped out immediately. Not even five full days later, Kerr wakes up in a scenario where he cannot continue Kuminga's exile, if for no other reason than because he otherwise lacks the human bodies necessary to fill out an NBA-grade rotation. As recently as yesterday afternoon, Kuminga was a distressed surplus asset with ruined trade value; today he is by default the second-best offensive player on a team that opened the weekend with perfectly credible playoff aspirations.",https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2026/01/GettyImages-2256616585.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:01:00.962419

Dobbins to return from injured reserve on Monday, according to the NFL's transaction wire. He is now eligible to practice this week and, if cleared, can be activated from IR. View our original post below.

This is huge.

The Denver Broncos are opening the practice window for running back J.K. Dobbins this week, ESPN's Adam Schefter first reported on Monday. The Broncos are expected to return to the practice field on Wednesday, and if Dobbins practices, it will open his 21-day window to be activated to the 53-man roster.

Dobbins suffered a Lisfranc injury in November and landed on injured reserve. Initial reports indicated that a potential Super Bowl return would be a best-case scenario for Dobbins, but coach Sean Payton (and the running back himself) hinted leading up to Week 18 that Dobbins might be able to return for the AFC Championship game, if the team made it that far.

Denver has since advanced to host the New England Patriots in the AFC title game on Jan. 25, but they will be without starting quarterback Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the divisional round. The Broncos are now set to start backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham, and getting Dobbins back would provide a huge boost to the offense.

The 27-year-old running back totaled 809 yards from scrimmage and scored four touchdowns in ten games before his foot injury. Dobbins was averaging 5.0 yards per carry before the injury and rookie RJ Harvey has only managed 3.3, 1.9, and 3.1 YPC over the last three games.

If the Broncos are going to activate Dobbins from IR in time for the Patriots game, a decision will have to be made by Saturday afternoon. Denver's considered a home underdog going into the AFC championship.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/12/SBRC/88144709007-broncos-on-injured-reserve.jpg?crop=8191,4609,x0,y427&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-20 19:03:36.431086

This was the kind of performance that made you think the Seahawks are destined to win the Super Bowl.
Though they were far from spectacular in their win over Houston, the Patriots nonetheless find themselves one game from the Super Bowl again.
Then again, neither was the Patriots squad that shocked the Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI with Mike Vrabel as a player.
Instead, it’s another season falling short of a Super Bowl title -- and it cost Sean McDermott his job.","Three of the top four seeds advanced to Championship Sunday in a playoff field that was said to be as wide open as any in memory.

The Divisional Round treated us to the good, the bad and the ugly, and the latter even applies to the team hosting the AFC Championship Game. Bo Nix's shocking ankle injury has completely shredded the Broncos' script. The question now, in historical terms, is whether this will be a Nick Foles-like ending ... or similar to Josh Johnson replacing an injured Brock Purdy in a 49ers slaughter at the hands of the Eagles?

The Super Bowl-winning QB could be one of the two MVP front-runners -- Drake Maye or Matthew Stafford -- or it could be backup Jarrett Stidham or the oft-maligned Sam Darnold. To Darnold's credit, he has stacked two very good years together, he just played through a likely painful oblique injury and he now captains an extremely dangerous Seahawks squad that has emerged -- somewhat similarly to last season's Eagles -- as the team to beat.

Don't say we didn't warn you. Seattle has topped these rankings since its Week 16 win over the Rams. If the 'Hawks can repeat that, they'll make their first Super Bowl appearance in more than a decade.

This was the kind of performance that made you think the Seahawks are destined to win the Super Bowl. That obviously remains to be seen, but Sam Darnold and his injured oblique were not even asked to do that much, and Seattle still had a three-score lead by halftime. The 'Hawks dominated from the opening kickoff return, which allowed their pass rushers to torment Brock Purdy and the 49ers all game long. Kenneth Walker III looked fresh as a daisy, rushing for a season-high 116 yards and three touchdowns, though Seattle lost complementary back Zach Charbonnet to a torn ACL. On a more positive note, it appears Charles Cross (foot) avoided serious injury, with Mike Macdonald calling the left tackle day-to-day. All in all, the Seahawks clearly are the favorites right now, given the way they're playing, although they are about to face the one team that might be able to get them, if their first two showdowns with the Rams are any indication. The initial bout resulted in a two-point L.A. win, while the second showdown went Seattle's way on a two-point conversion in overtime. Buckle up for what could be a classic rubber match.

Though they were far from spectacular in their win over Houston, the Patriots nonetheless find themselves one game from the Super Bowl again. Their defensive performance on Sunday gets as much credit as (if not more credit than) the offensive effort, and now they are the favorites in the AFC title match vs. the Bo Nix-less Broncos. You can talk about the Pats' ""easy"" path, and it's worth mentioning the breaks they've caught in terms of their schedule and opponents' injuries; it's all accurate. This is not a juggernaut. Then again, neither was the Patriots squad that shocked the Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI with Mike Vrabel as a player. Today, the coach and Drake Maye have turned this into a team that believes in itself. Amazingly, the pressure is squarely on the AFC upstarts, who are suddenly in line to face Denver backup Jarrett Stidham , a former New England second-stringer who threw 48 forgettable passes for the Pats back in the day. Maye and his pass protection have to be better than they were against the Texans, but this is now viewed as their game to win, even if it will take place in a stadium that has been historically wicked to New England.

The Rams won a road playoff game in overtime despite their offensive-whiz coach and MVP front-runner quarterback having the kind of night that inspired them to deliver quotes like ""I have to be better for our group, I will be better for our group"" (Sean McVay) and ""Obviously, I can be better"" ( Matthew Stafford ). Still, Stafford hit on enough big throws when they counted, finishing the job after Los Angeles' defense made the key takeaway in overtime. And McVay finally turned to the run game, handing off 19 times in the fourth quarter and overtime after ignoring the ground attack for most of the first three quarters. Now, L.A. gets a chance at redemption after the painful loss at Seattle in Week 16, which tilted the NFC West and the conference's top seed in the Seahawks' direction. That game came down to just a few missed plays by the Rams, including Harrison Mevis ' errant 48-yard field goal attempt late in the fourth quarter. It was his only miss so far this season, and his game-winner in Chicago set up the showdown that felt inevitable. The Rams might be underdogs, but they looked like the best team in football at one point this season, and they have a chance to be that again.

Bo Nix 's broken ankle has to be one of the cruelest injuries in recent memory. Nix and the Broncos started hot in Saturday's game against the Bills, went into a lull, then engineered go-ahead and game-winning drives in the fourth quarter and overtime in a terrific showing. Sean Payton showed trust in his young quarterback, and Nix delivered. Now, with Nix done for the season, it'll be Jarrett Stidham , who hasn't attempted a regular-season pass in two years and who has never played in a playoff game before. And at center, Denver could be down to its third-stringer, depending on the health of Alex Forsyth , who suffered an ankle injury of his own. I can't wait for Payton to lay it on thick all week with the disrespect card, and I also can't wait to see what kind of offensive plan he cooks up against a Patriots defense that has come to play in two postseason games so far. It might take a special effort by Denver's defense, which has been very good all season, to beat Drake Maye, but it's an assignment this unit can carry out on its best pass-rush day.

This was supposed to be the season Josh Allen got it done, with Patrick Mahomes , Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow unable to hurt the Bills in the playoffs. Instead, it’s another season falling short of a Super Bowl title -- and it cost Sean McDermott his job. The Bills didn’t punt once in their overtime loss at Denver. Everything was either a touchdown, field goal or turnover. There were five of the latter, and only one turnover for the Broncos, which ultimately did Buffalo in. You can talk about non-catches and shaky penalties until you’re royal blue in the face, but the giveaways were killers. James Cook’s fumble was a huge early turning point, and Allen’s two fumbles led to six painful Denver points. The Bills rang up 449 yards of offense and went 10-for-15 on third downs, 1-for-1 on fourth down and 3-for-5 in the red zone -- and they still lost. The late flags were also hard to ignore. After only 15 penalty yards in the game’s first 54-plus minutes, the Bills drew four flags in the final six snaps of the game, costing them 53 yards. This was a game the Bills could have -- perhaps should have -- won, and that’s why Buffalo will have a new coach in 2026.

C.J. Stroud followed up his five-fumble game against the Steelers with a four-interception first half against the Patriots, and we’re left to wonder if the quarterback who looked so precocious as a rookie will ever return to that form. He’s played below that level in the two seasons since, reaching a new low with the two recent playoff games, and the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer following a first-round QB’s third campaign is typically when contract-extension talks begin. Is Houston ready to lock up Stroud at more than $45 million per year? That’s a big commitment for a quarterback seemingly going in the wrong direction. The Texans’ world-class defense gives them a shot to be title contenders, and Stroud can’t be blamed for the lack of offensive options, with all the injuries that hit late in the season and at New England. But Houston has to know that Stroud can reverse this trend before feeling too good about making a significant financial commitment at the game’s most important position.

The Bears couldn’t go down without giving the Solder Field crowd one more heart-stopper, with Caleb Williams slinging his fourth-down miracle to Cole Kmet . But their magic ran out in overtime with Williams’ third pick -- a play heavily dissected for DJ Moore ’s route, too -- and not enough stops on defense. The Bears were clearly a flawed team, but also one brimming with self-belief and clutch playmaking ability, and they milked it to the last drop. There’s obviously a bright future in Chicago with Ben Johnson and Williams and the rest of the crew, but there’s also work needed to make this team a true Super Bowl contender. Chicago’s defense turned in a valiant effort in the Rams loss, but that’s the unit I would be seeking to upgrade first this offseason, even with a few lingering offensive issues. I can’t wait to see what the Bears do to try to address it, but I am also realistic about the idea that progress is rarely linear. That's very important context to keep in mind, especially for a team so wholly dependent on defensive takeaways and late-game heroics.

The season ended with a giant thud, with the last bollards collapsing under the weight of injuries and shortcomings against a superior Seahawks squad. We know about all the defensive losses the 49ers had suffered en route to the Divisional Round, and then the offense was served a dose of pain with George Kittle already out and Christian McCaffrey and Jake Tonges barely making it through the loss. Kyle Shanahan did nothing short of a masterful job with this team amid all the chaos. His job might not be any easier next season, with stellar DC Robert Saleh taking the Titans' head-coaching job, and the Niners have to figure out how to avoid the wave of injuries that seems to cripple them every year. Brock Purdy showed some stuff this season, but he naturally remains at his best with a strong group around him. With only decent salary cap space and limited draft resources, can San Francisco make enough foundational improvements to help the quarterback and team as a whole?",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/jbf56eaxtqzitwhtdlxt,N,,2026-01-20 15:00:26.559140

Nix is hoping to be ready for Week 1 next season. But that was unknown immediately after the game, and may have offered little to no consolation in the moment.

Nix suffered the injury on the Broncos’ third-to-last play before Wil Lutz’s game-winning field goal against the Bills. He finished the game. Nix also participated in an on-field interview after helping the Broncos reach their first AFC Championship Game since 2015.

Izzy, Nix’s father, Patrick, and Broncos QBs Jarrett Stidham and Sam Ehlinger were there.

Still, Nix sat on the floor in a hallway, his back against a wall. The posture both fit and underscored the moment. Broncos head coach Sean Payton joined in. He joked that he told Nix the Broncos would not have drafted him had they known about his two previous ankle injuries.

The message from coach to QB was clear, though, with Payton remarking that Nix is “such a strong, faith-based guy.”

“He knows that God’s got a plan for him,” Payton told reporters on January 17. “He’s a tough cookie. And I said, ‘Listen, I believe you’re the second quarterback in Year 2 to take your team to a championship game,’ and the first is [Patrick] Mahomes. And this team, all year, has lost key players.

“We’ll rise up for the next challenge, and we’ll go from there.”

Pat Surtain II Sends Strong Message for Bo Nix Before AFC Championship Game

The Broncos will not have Nix the rest of the way, however long that may be, but the second-year QB is on the minds of teammates like All-Pro cornerback Pat Surtain II.

The reigning Defensive Player of the Year and three-time Pro Bowler expressed sentiments of support following Nix’s injury, for which he will undergo surgery during the coming week. Even if he is not physically present, Nix will be with Surtain and the Broncos.

“We got ya 10!” Surtain captioned a post on his Instagram story on January 17.

While the Broncos eye potentially getting players back, such as running back J.K. Dobbins, losing Nix is a cloud that will loom over them the rest of the way.

And as we saw last year, that was indeed a problem for the Cowboys.
When you think about the Cowboys are about to hire their fourth defensive coordinator in four years, that pretty much wipes out any chance of real consistency.
And that was one of the biggest problems for the Cowboys defense in 2025 - regular mistakes and confusion especially in the secondary.
Overall, the substations were a lack of communication, which stems from the leadership, both from the players and coaches.","Kurt: We hear on a regular basis how the offensive line needs to play together in order to build communication, and if you ask any running back, he'll tell you he's got to have consistent reps to get into the flow of the game. So it only makes sense that, although perhaps to a lesser degree, the same can be said for the defense.

And as we saw last year, that was indeed a problem for the Cowboys. Consider that only three players in the team's secondary played at least 50 percent of the snaps in 2025, Donovan Wilson (83.2), DaRon Bland (67.4) and Malik Hooker (53.7), and even they all missed games due to injury. And just one linebacker, Kenneth Murray, played more than half the snaps (78.9) on the way to Dallas finishing last in the league in points allowed (30.1).

Conversely, Seattle's defense, which led the NFL in average points given up (16.6), had six defensive backs see at least 60 percent of the Seahawks' snaps with five linebackers getting in on 50 percent of the plays. They also had 17 defensemen overall play at least 20 percent of their snaps while the Cowboys had a whopping 24 top 20 percent, if you count DeMarvion Overshown coming in at 19.7.

That kind of turnover makes finding any kind of cohesion so much tougher. There's just no denying that injuries, general poor play and, in turn, a lack of significant depth were key factors in the unit's struggles with communication.

So yes, a new defensive coordinator was needed to straighten out some of this mess, but if they run into the same injuries and even talent evaluation next season, the Cowboys defense could be in for another tough campaign.

Nick: First of all, I think we can throw consistency out the window when talking about the defense. Nothing consistent about this season, the previous one or the one before that. When you think about the Cowboys are about to hire their fourth defensive coordinator in four years, that pretty much wipes out any chance of real consistency.

Sure, you're talking about as the season goes on and wondering if there should be that many mistakes, especially with guys not sure what to do. And the answer is no - that shouldn't be happening. And that was one of the biggest problems for the Cowboys defense in 2025 - regular mistakes and confusion especially in the secondary. That's going to happen when you play a lot of young players, have a lot of injuries and the Cowboys had both. But it can't just end right there. This team had systematic failures on defense all year long and that has to fall on the coordinator and coaching staff, which it did.

But in terms of substitutions, I think the Cowboys were always looking for the right combination, just hoping to find the best players on the field. Sure, you like to rotate on defense, especially on the line, but there can't be a major drop-off. That was always he problem with having guys like DeMarcus Ware and Micah Parsons - sure they needed a break, but when is the right time to have your best pass-rusher off the field. Well, the Cowboys didn't have those problems this year. The starters and backups weren't that different and that was a reason for the lack of sacks and pressures. Overall, the substations were a lack of communication, which stems from the leadership, both from the players and coaches. All of it needs to be changed and it sounds like the Cowboys are working towards doing that.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/qpcd3knx4xnqyrpmrfxf,N,,2026-01-20 16:01:45.029917

Working for CBS Sports, then-analyst Ben DiNucci spoke about the impact of Nix's injury and the role of Jarrett Stidham as he assumes the role of starting quarterback.

""This is next man up mentality to a T,"" DiNucci said. ""For Jarrett Stidham, there's a reason he re-signed with the Denver Broncos in the offseason; a chance to play, a chance to mean something for this team if something, God forbid, happened to Bo Nix, which unfortunately, it did tonight.""

DiNucci detailed how things are likely to go in practice this week for Denver; the cadence of everything will have to change, the mindset will change, and obviously, the quarterback will have changed.

One day after his breakdown for CBS Sports, the quarterback-turned analyst got a call from the Broncos and signed with the team's practice squad.

DiNucci officially signed with Denver's practice squad on Monday, taking over QB3 duties. DiNucci has experience with head coach Sean Payton, having been with the Broncos in 2023. DiNucci could serve as Denver's emergency third quarterback for the AFC championship on Sunday.

Kittle hurt his right Achilles tendon in a wild-card win over Philadelphia on Jan. 11 and had surgery last week in Los Angeles. Kittle said Dr. Neal ElAttrache told him he had a “clean tear” near his soleus muscle that is higher on the Achilles tendon.

“They didn’t have to drill into my heel,” Kittle said Monday. “Where the repair was, there’s more blood flow so it takes some time off the recovery time. So he’s very excited about everything. My recovery — when I’ll be running, when I’ll be ready to go play again — he’s very excited about it. So that puts me in a really good mood. It’s not as bad as other ones.”

Kittle didn't want to give a timeline for his potential return, saying, “I'll keep it a surprise.” But a return in eight to nine months could get Kittle back on the field near the beginning of the 2026 season.

Kittle said he knew immediately how serious the injury was, saying it ""felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger.”

He told the Eagles trainer who was first on the field to check on him that he needed a cart and was taken back to the locker room. Kittle was joined there by his family, as well as Niners owner Jed York, who procured a bottle of tequila for his star player.

“Getting his support was absolutely fantastic,"" Kittle said. ""Just the fact that the team owner comes down to come give his condolences to you, and just like stays there for you, just really means what kind of place this is, and the people that are in this building. And it makes me really happy to be a Niner.”

Kittle is a two-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowler who is a key part of San Francisco’s offence as a passing threat and a blocker in the run game. He had 57 catches for 628 yards receiving and seven touchdowns this season.

The Niners struggled offensively in his absence last week, losing 41-6 to Seattle in the divisional round.

Injury updates

There were a few other injury updates on locker cleanout day.

Star linebacker Fred Warner said he was ready to return had the team advanced to the NFC title game, but now will slow down his rehabilitation work with significantly more time to heal.

“I think my rehab had gotten obviously super accelerated to try to make the NFC championship game,” Warner said. ""Now, I just get to kind of slow things down and really just work on all the little things that I didn’t get to work on before all this happened. It’s just business as usual.”

Rookie defensive end Mykel Williams, who tore his ACL in Week 9, said his rehabilitation is going well and he hopes to be ready for the season opener.

Quarterback Brock Purdy said he won't need any special treatment for his turf toe injury that sidelined him for eight games during the season.

″The toe is good to go,” Purdy said. “Obviously, I’ll continue to strengthen it and give it some rest and whatnot. But it’s good.”",https://www.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CP174967123.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:08:09.243664

With that said, let’s take a look at the most impactful injuries around the league this week.

Let’s dive in.

NFL Conference Championship Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Bo Nix, Denver Broncos

Broncos fans got terrible news shortly after their win this week over Buffalo. The news was that Bo Nix has suffered a broken ankle and would miss the remainder of the playoffs. This is a huge blow, and his backup is Jarrett Stidham, who hasn’t thrown an NFL pass since 2023.

NFL Conference Championship Injury Report: Running Backs

J.K. Dobbins, Denver Broncos

Dobbins is officially having his practice window opened, meaning there’s a chance he could return to action should Denver make the Super Bowl. This would be a notable addition for this roster, as RJ Harvey has been more effective as a pass-catching back than as a runner.

Zach Charbonnet, Seattle Seahawks

Charbonnet suffered a torn ACL this weekend against San Francisco, ending his season. Seattle will be without their leading touchdown scorer for the conference championship against the Rams.

NFL Conference Championship Injury Report: Wide Receivers

Troy Franklin, Denver Broncos

Franklin suffered a hamstring injury that took him out of action this weekend. His status will be monitored, but his loss was certainly felt, given the other injuries to this offense.

Pat Bryant, Denver Broncos

Bryant suffered a concussion this weekend and will be in the protocol this week as a result. He will have to clear concussion protocol to return to action against the Patriots this week, which feels unlikely at this stage.

NFL Conference Championship Injury Report: Tight Ends

Elijah Arroyo, Seattle Seahawks

Arroyo ended up missing the divisional round of the playoffs due to his knee injury. He’s got a chance to return for the conference round, but it remains to be seen at this point.",https://d29m18w01sxjzp.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/source/fatest/bo_nix_afc_championship_injury_report-1000x600.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:09:02.680817

What a bummer for Charbonnet and for this Seahawks offense.","Unfortunately, Seattle Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald’s initial optimism that running back Zach Charbonnet’s injury was not serious was merely optimism. The reality is that Charbonnet, who led all Seahawks players with 12 touchdowns scored, will not play again this season.

Coach Macdonald confirmed on his weekly Seattle Sports 710 radio appearance that Charbonnet’s knee injury, which he suffered in the second quarter of Seattle’s 41-6 Divisional Round win over the San Francisco 49ers, is serious enough to need season-ending surgery.

Charbonnet was in the middle of the best season of his career, rushing for 730 yards and the aforementioned 12 touchdowns, the most by any Seahawks running back since Marshawn Lynch in 2014. Alongside Kenneth Walker III, Seattle’s rushing attack has improved significantly over the past several weeks, with Charbonnet notably rushing for the Seahawks’ only touchdown in the Week 18 NFC West title game against the 49ers, having previously rushed for over 100 yards and two scores in Week 17 at the Carolina Panthers. Of course, the story of Seattle’s top seed can’t be told without Charbonnet’s bizarre game-tying two-point conversion against the Los Angeles Rams.

The Seahawks will now turn to Walker as the undisputed number one option at running back. Walker rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns in a magnificent showing versus San Francisco, but after a season’s worth of splitting carries with Charbonnet, he’s going to be getting the bulk of the carries starting with this Sunday’s NFC Championship Game against the Los Angeles Rams.

Seattle does have other backup options at running back on the practice squad, including Velus Jones Jr and former Rams starter Cam Akers. George Holani is still on injured reserve and there hasn’t been much of an indication that he’s nearing a return, but we’ll see on that front.

The Bills fired Sean McDermott on Monday, making the 10th coaching change of the 2026 cycle.

Gannon is reportedly talking with the Cowboys about their defensive coordinator position this week, and has interviewed with the Titans for their head coaching job.
UPDATE: It looks like the openings have fallen back down to seven again, with the Dolphins going with Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley.","There are 8 coaching openings now. Again. After starting as 9 and falling to 7, and with a total of 10 overall.

The Bills fired Sean McDermott on Monday, making the 10th coaching change of the 2026 cycle. The Giants (John Harbaugh) and the Falcons (Kevin Stefanski) have already filled their vacancies, but still, 10 switches in one cycle is an incredibly big number.

The Cardinals are obviously one of the 10.

ESPN reported that this is the fifth time there have been 10 openings for one coaching cycle, the others being 1978, 1997, 2006, and 2022. Only within one of these cycles were the Cardinals seeking a coach; that came back in 1978 after Don Coryell left and the team hired Bud Wilkinson. (It should be noted that in 1978 there were only 28 teams, so 10 openings was 36 percent of the jobs, higher than now with 32 teams.)

The Bills move impacts the Cardinals from two angles -- one, as another opening with which the Cards may have to contend with in terms of taking a candidate the Cards may want; two, putting McDermott on the market. We'll see if McDermott would have any interest for Cardinals GM Monti Ossenfort, but even to a lesser level, if McDermott ends up in one of the other vacancies, that could make available a coach that would have otherwise taken the job McDermott gets.

Among the coaches the Cardinals have reportedly reached out to that remain in the playoffs -- now down to the final four -- are Rams assistants Mike LaFleur and Chris Shula, Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, and Patriots passing game coordinator Thomas Brown.

Also coming out Monday was the news the Lions are hiring Cardinals offensive coordinator Drew Petzing in the same role, the first coach on Jonathan Gannon's staff to get another NFL spot. Gannon is reportedly talking with the Cowboys about their defensive coordinator position this week, and has interviewed with the Titans for their head coaching job.

UPDATE: It looks like the openings have fallen back down to seven again, with the Dolphins going with Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley.

However it happens, the Seahawks will need their run game to take pressure off of Darnold as he continues to play through an oblique injury.
How he performs in Charbonnet's absence will help determine his future in Seattle and whether the Seahawks' offense can continue to ride its run game to Super Bowl LX.","RENTON, Wash. -- If not for Zach Charbonnet, the Seattle Seahawks might be playing Sunday's NFC Championship Game against the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium as opposed to hosting it at Lumen Field as the conference's top seed. Or they might not be playing for a trip to Super Bowl LX at all.

Recall how significant of a role the third-year running back played when the Seahawks beat their division rivals in Seattle in Week 16.

Charbonnet opened the scoring with a 4-yard touchdown run and then made an all-time heads-up play on a 2-point attempt in the fourth quarter. As other players were starting to walk off the field, thinking Sam Darnold's screen pass had been batted down for an incompletion, Charbonnet wisely grabbed what turned out to be a live ball in the end zone. The successful try tied the score at 30-30, completing the Seahawks' improbable comeback from a 16-point deficit before they prevailed in overtime.

The win kept them atop the NFC West standings and in control of the conference's top seed.

The play that kept them alive in regulation showed one of the many traits that have made Charbonnet a favorite of coach Mike Macdonald. But the Seahawks will be without those traits for the rest of their postseason now that Charbonnet -- part of their two-headed rushing attack with Kenneth Walker III -- needs season-ending surgery to repair a knee injury he suffered during Seattle's 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round Saturday.

You could hear the pain in Macdonald's voice when he delivered the news Monday.

""It breaks your heart,"" Macdonald told Seattle Sports 710-AM. ""... Prayers go out to Charbs. We love him, man. This guy is the epitome of what it means to be a Seahawk. Absolute tough as nails, great teammate, great human being, plays his tail off, detail-oriented, unselfish. This hurts, man. It hurts that it's going on, but he's going to be back. He's going to be back stronger than ever, and the guys are going to pick him up.""

Charbonnet's loss is a significant one given his importance in third down and short-yardage situations, but it shouldn't be insurmountable if Walker continues his recent tear.

Walker carried 19 times for 116 yards and three touchdowns against San Francisco, powering Seattle's red-hot run game after Charbonnet went down in the second quarter. Walker finished with 100 yards in the Week 16 win over the Rams and 97 when they beat the 49ers in the regular-season finale, which put him over 1,000 for the season.

""I think Ken has done a heck of a job,"" Macdonald said. ""I think you're seeing the results in the past X amount of weeks now of ... stacking all those reps. I thought this was the most decisive he's ran up to this point, and as expected, you just keep getting better and keep finding ways to improve, especially in the run game. He's done a great job.""

Walker has played in all 18 games this season after entering the final year of his rookie contract with durability concerns. It has probably helped that he hasn't carried the ball more than 19 times in any of them while sharing the work with Charbonnet. The rest of the Seahawks' playoff run will either be a test of Walker's ability to handle a greater workload or of the ability of their backup running backs to step into larger roles, whether it's Cam Akers, Velus Jones Jr., George Holani or a combination of the three.

However it happens, the Seahawks will need their run game to take pressure off of Darnold as he continues to play through an oblique injury.

Akers, who won Super Bowl LVI with the Rams, and Jones are on Seattle's practice squad. Holani is eligible to come off injured reserve -- where he has been since hurting his hamstring in Week 12 - though Macdonald did not indicate whether or not that will happen this week.

""That's part of the reason we brought them here, is to provide great running back depth,"" Macdonald said of Jones and Akers. ""Both are really good players in their own right, and they've got a great opportunity in front of them. You hate it to be under these circumstances, but it is what it is. We've got to move forward. So they'll be ready to go.""

Another way in which the Seahawks can make up for Charbonnet's absence is with their tush push play, which has become almost unstoppable in short-yardage situations with tight end AJ Barner. Barner has converted 10 of 11 attempts, though only one of those plays has resulted in a touchdown as Seattle has instead relied on Charbonnet at the goal line. Six of Charbonnet's team-high 12 rushing touchdowns came from 1 or 2 yards out.

""That's going to be something we continue to lean on,"" Macdonald said of the tush push. ""These other guys will be good in some of those [goal-line] situations as well.""

When the Seahawks opted not to give Walker an extension this past offseason when he became eligible for one, the logical assumption was that they had reservations about his durability after sitting out 10 games in three years. He was then limited during the spring because of an ankle injury before a sore foot sidelined him for a chunk of training camp.

It was a tough start to a contract year after Walker had made changes over the offseason to his eating and sleeping habits with an eye toward improving his durability and performance. But since then, he has barely appeared on the weekly injury reports while playing in all 18 games so far.

How he performs in Charbonnet's absence will help determine his future in Seattle and whether the Seahawks' offense can continue to ride its run game to Super Bowl LX.

""I know he was working through his foot over the course of the offseason. That was frustrating for him because of the amount of work that he was putting in,"" Macdonald said. ""Hopefully he realizes the dividends that's paid, that work he put in to really get himself in a good spot up to this point. I've seen a guy that's gotten better through the season. You can't say that about all runners, so that's a tribute to him and how he's taken I have taken care of his body.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0120%2Fr1603038_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 10:01:42.979975

He said Byron Young has a sore knee, which is likely what limited him to a season-low snap share, but he’s expected to be able to play against the Seahawks in the NFC title game. Emmanuel Forbes Jr. left the game after just four snaps due to a shoulder injury, as well, and did not return.

McVay said neither injury should limit Young or Forbes in the NFC Championship Game, which is great news.

Josiah Stewart and Desjuan Johnson played increased snaps with Young banged up, helping fill in for the Rams' standout edge rusher. With Forbes injured, the Rams leaned on Roger McCreary, Darious Williams and Cobie Durant in the secondary.

One of the main storylines for the Niners heading into the 2026 NFL season will be the recovery of George Kittle.

Kittle suffered a torn Achilles tendon injury during the 49ers’ wild-card win over the Philadelphia Eagles. It was another blow for San Francisco, who couldn’t escape the injury bug all season to their top and even depth players.

On Jan. 19, Kittle spoke with the media and shared the latest regarding his recovery, as the veteran will likely do his best to be ready for Week 1 later this year.

“Overall, I’m fantastic,” Kittle said (h/t 95.7 The Game). “Surgeon went really, really well. The surgeon was incredibly happy with it. A little background into it: He said, ‘Best-case scenario when you tear an Achilles is that you tear it up high by your soleus,’ which is what I did. I had a clean tear. I didn’t have to drill into my heel. Where the repair was is where there was more blood flow.

“It takes some time off the recovery time. He’s very excited about everything—my recovery, when I’ll be running, when I’ll be ready to play again. He’s very excited about it. That puts me in a really good mood. It’s not as bad as the other ones, so just excited about that.”

49ers’ George Kittle Confirms Tequila Story

Moreover, Kittle also confirmed the tequila story, noting that he had the alcoholic drink in the locker room once the 49ers star knew he tore his Achilles tendon.

“My first response to that is, ‘Can I get Jed fined? What’s the question? Can I get Jed fined by talking about tequila?’ I would stop,” Kittle added (h/t 95.7 The Game). “Yeah, it happened. Had a great time.”

If the 49ers pursue a tight end either in the draft or free agency, perhaps it will allow them to take their time with Kittle and not rush him for Week 1 to ensure that the player is fully healthy once he’s ready to go for the 2026 season.

49ers Need to Address Injury Woes This Offseason

Injuries have been a major storyline for the 49ers for a while. As a result, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones is urging San Francisco to find the root of the problem and address it as injuries have held this team back.

“The Niners have to figure out how to get healthier,” Jones said during a Jan. 17 appearance on CBS Sports HQ. “This continues to happen to them time and again because if you look at it, if they can stay moderately healthy, average health, they will make the playoffs every year. They will make noise in the playoffs. I can go on, and we could talk about how they need another wide receiver, and they do.

“They need some depth on the defense and certainly they could use some pass rush and some corner help. There’s no doubt that if they ran it back with the team that they have and even lose the free agents that they’re going to have, if they could stay healthy, 75 to 80 percent healthy, they’re in the NFC Championship game. I absolutely mean that. But instead, they can’t.”",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/george-kittle-san-francisco-49ers_e71f46.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-20 11:09:19.439319

Kittle didn’t want to give a timeline for his potential return, saying, “I’ll keep it a surprise.” But a return in eight to nine months could get Kittle back on the field near the beginning of the 2026 season.

Kittle said he knew immediately how serious the injury was, saying it “felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger.”

He told the Eagles trainer who was first on the field to check on him that he needed a cart and was taken back to the locker room. Kittle was joined there by his family, as well as Niners owner Jed York, who procured a bottle of tequila for his star player.

“Getting his support was absolutely fantastic,” Kittle said. “Just the fact that the team owner comes down to come give his condolences to you, and just like stays there for you, just really means what kind of place this is, and the people that are in this building. And it makes me really happy to be a Niner.”

Kittle is a two-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowler who is a key part of San Francisco’s offense as a passing threat and a blocker in the run game. He had 57 catches for 628 yards receiving and seven touchdowns this season.

The Niners struggled offensively in his absence last week, losing 41-6 to Seattle in the divisional round.

Injury updates

There were a few other injury updates on locker cleanout day.

Star linebacker Fred Warner said he was ready to return had the team advanced to the NFC title game, but now will slow down his rehabilitation work with significantly more time to heal.

“I think my rehab had gotten obviously super accelerated to try to make the NFC championship game,” Warner said. “Now, I just get to kind of slow things down and really just work on all the little things that I didn’t get to work on before all this happened. It’s just business as usual.”

Rookie defensive end Mykel Williams, who tore his ACL in Week 9, said his rehabilitation is going well and he hopes to be ready for the season opener.

Quarterback Brock Purdy said he won’t need any special treatment for his turf toe injury that sidelined him for eight games during the season.

″The toe is good to go,” Purdy said. “Obviously, I’ll continue to strengthen it and give it some rest and whatnot. But it’s good.”

He was able to really help Mukuba during his rookie season.","Drew Mukuba had finally found some consistency in his rookie season and then it was over in a flash.

On Nov. 18, Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio agreed that the rookie from Texas had finally found consistency in his game after an “uneven” start to his season.

A few days later, Mukuba fractured his fibula in Dallas.

“The toughest part about that was just knowing that I can’t finish the year out,” Mukuba said at locker cleanout day last week. “I just started to build some consistency in my game. So knowing that I was able to do that and that I was playing at a high level, I felt like going down, that was kind of discouraging.

“But I kind of got over it with the guys around me and the help that I had. They helped change my mentality. Knowing that this is not a bad thing, just another way, another hurdle I gotta get over. I was able to work through that.”

After Mukuba suffered his fibula fracture that needed surgery, the Eagles didn’t rule him out for the season and held out some public hope that he could return at some point.

But at locker cleanout day, Mukuba said there was no way he could have returned even if the Eagles made it to the Super Bowl. The day after the Eagles’ season ended, Mukuba was still in a walking boot. But he did express an expectation that he will be ready for spring practices in May.

While Mukuba’s season ended on a sour note because of the injury, he feels pretty encouraged by some of his progress as a rookie.

“Yeah, definitely,” Mukuba said. “I feel like with my experience this year, everything I seen, I feel like I played a lot of snaps to see a lot of things. I feel like going into my second year, that’s going to help me a lot because I’m already ahead. I know what to expect and I know what’s going to happen. Now it’s just my job to do my part.”

While Mukuba didn’t begin the season as a starter, he the second-round pick from Texas took over that role and started the next 10 games. He had some ups and downs but showed some promise with 46 tackles, 2 interceptions and 3 pass breakups.

Mukuba made some plays on the ball but he gave up some plays too. He was targeted 20 times in his rookie season and gave up 14 passes for 263 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His opposer passer rating allowed was a 106.3. But Fangio expected some growing pains for a rookie safety.

Like Fangio said earlier in the season, Mukuba’s rookie season was “uneven” at one point. But he really began to even it out before the injury. He found a stability in his game.

How did he get there?

“Just looking in the mirror, looking at myself and what I needed to do on my end,” Mukuba said. “I just felt like there were a lot of things I needed to get better at and I didn’t get to rush it. Just take one step at a time, finding one thing to work on, get better at that and then finding something else to improve on. Once I got to do that, that’s when I started to see my game grow, started to get better in a lot of areas I was struggling in. That’s when everything picked up for me.”

After Mukuba went down, the Eagles started Sydney Brown for one game but then quickly inserted veteran Marcus Epps into that spot for the rest of the season next to Reed Blankenship.

There are some serious questions about the Eagles’ safety position going into 2026 because both Blankenship and Epps are pending free agents. There’s a chance one or both could be gone.

Blankenship, 26, joined the Eagles as an undrafted rookie in 2022 but became a full-time starter over the last three seasons. He was able to really help Mukuba during his rookie season.

“Just really how to be a pro, to be honest with you,” Mukuba said when asked what he learned from Blankenship. “I feel like how he handles his business, how he takes care of his body, what he did off the field with the person he is overall, it really taught me a lot. I was just sitting back and watching him and learning and he definitely showed me how to be a true professional.”",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/11/Mukuba-D-USATSI-2247173456.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-20 11:09:29.087294

Several players were injured during the contest, with multiple Patriots among those to go down.

With the AFC Championship Game against the Denver Broncos on the horizon, let’s assess the damage after rewatching the Patriots’ 28-16 win.

Patriots injury analysis: NFL divisional playoffs

LB Robert Spillane: The Patriots’ defensive leader took a trip to the blue medical tent on the sideline after the Texans’ second series and was announced as questionable to return with a thumb injury. However, the issue did not keep him out long. While he did end up missing five defensive snaps, Spillane was back on the field at the start of the next series in the late first quarter.

RB TreVeyon Henderson: Henderson remained on the ground after a short run in the early second period, but eventually jogged to sideline under his own power. He did get checked out by trainers and was not on the field for the subsequent two offensive snaps, but returned for the next series midway through the quarter. No injury was announced by the team.

RB Rhamondre Stevenson: The Patriots’ lead running back spent some time on the sideline in the first half after getting poked in the eye. He was ultimately announced as questionable to return, but by the third quarter was back in action wearing a clear visor on his helmet. Stevenson ended up carrying the ball 13 times for 45 yards after reentering, and did not show any limitations.

S Craig Woodson: The rookie safety took a hard hit on his interception with 8:37 left in the second quarter and looked shaken up afterwards. He visited the medical tent and was announced as questionable to return with a head injury, but ultimately was cleared for return and ended up missing just two defensive snaps.

CB Charles Woods: On the very next play after Craig Woodson’s return, another defensive back got banged up. No. 4 cornerback Charles Woods was slow to get up after a punt, but he ultimately made his way to the sideline and did not end up missing any time. As with the aforementioned TreVeyon Henderson, no injury was announced by the team.

OT Morgan Moses: The Patriots’ starting right tackle was slow to get up after a lost fumble midway through the third quarter, but he made his way to the sideline under his own power. No injury update was announced, and Moses was back in action after New England had reacquired possession five plays later. He did end up missing a pair of snaps later in the game, though: on the two final kneel-downs, backup tackle Thayer Munford Jr. took his spot in the lineup.

ED Anfernee Jennings: Jennings was able to sack Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud with 2:37 left in the third quarter, but with teammate Christian Elliss coming in to clean up came down hard on the ground. The sixth-year defender was shaken up a bit, but never entered the medical tent and was back in action after two plays.

CB Carlton Davis: After catching two interceptions earlier in the game, Davis had to exit the contest in the early fourth quarter. The veteran cornerback was banged up after making a tackle on a run play, and was immediately removed from the field. He went into the medical tent and was announced as questionable to return with a head injury. Eventually, Davis departed for the locker room and was ruled out with two minutes left in the game.

What this means for the Patriots

The Patriots’ injury situation obviously is not as dire as the Broncos’ — Denver lost starting quarterback Bo Nix to an ankle injury on Saturday — but there are still some question marks hanging over the team. The biggest among them is starting cornerback Carlton Davis, whose head injury will be worth paying close attention to in the coming days.

Davis himself did not speak with the media after the game, which is standard procedure for players dealing with head injuries. On Monday, Mike Vrabel did not provide any update on his status.

Should Davis end up missing time, the Patriots’ backup cornerbacks will be pressed into action. Based on the season so far, Charles Woods projects as the next man up. The team also recently got Alex Austin back from injured reserve and has rookie Kobee Minor as additional depth on the 53-man roster.

As for the other injuries listed above, none of them seemed overly serious.

Charbonnet injured his knee during Saturday night’s 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC divisional round.

“He’s got a significant knee injury, unfortunately,” Macdonald said on Seattle Sports 710 on Monday. “Breaks your heart. He’s going to need surgery, so he’s got a good long road to come back. Our heart goes out to him, prayers go out to Charbs. We love him, man.”

During the regular season, Charbonnet led the Seahawks with 12 rushing touchdowns, as well as added 730 yards, which trailed only Kenneth Walker III for the team lead.

Charbonnet became the first Seahawks running back since Marshawn Lynch in 2014 to rush for at least 10 touchdowns in a season.

Walker, whose three rushing touchdowns against the 49ers tied him with Shaun Alexander for the most in a playoff game in franchise history, is the only healthy running back on Seattle’s roster. The Seahawks could add either of veteran running backs Velus Jones Jr. or Cam Akers from the practice squad, as well as George Holani, who has been on injured reserve since late November.

Regardless, the Seahawks will be without Charbonnet ahead of their NFC championship game matchup against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.

“This guy is the epitome of what it means to be a Seahawk,” Macdonald said. “Absolute tough as nails, great teammate, great human being, plays his tail off, detail oriented, unselfish.

Asked if there was a timeline for his return, Kittle initially said he'd ""keep it as a surprise.""
""[ElAttrache] said best-case scenario when you tear an Achilles is that you tear it up high by your soleus, which is what I did.
Whether it's from injury, free agency or potential trade, Kittle's situation isn't the only possible return the 49ers are monitoring this offseason.
He missed most of training camp as he battled a hamstring injury and sought a lucrative contract extension from the Niners.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Despite tearing his right Achilles tendon on Jan. 11, San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle said he is optimistic he could return to the field sooner than expected next season.

As the 49ers cleaned out their lockers Monday, Kittle spoke to the media for the first time since the injury, explaining that it was the ""best-case scenario"" because of where the tear occurred and how clean it was.

Asked if there was a timeline for his return, Kittle initially said he'd ""keep it as a surprise."" but he later scoffed when asked by a reporter whether his return would be around midseason and said it could happen ""well before November.""

Dr. Neal ElAttrache did the surgery on Kittle's Achilles last week in Los Angeles.

""Surgery went really, really good,"" Kittle said. ""[ElAttrache] said best-case scenario when you tear an Achilles is that you tear it up high by your soleus, which is what I did. I had a clean tear. They didn't have to drill into my heel. And where the repair was there's more blood flow. And so it takes some time off of the recovery time... It's not as bad as other ones.""

When the injury happened in the first half against the Eagles, Kittle said a member of Philadelphia's athletic training staff came over and asked what he needed. His immediate response? A cart.

""I knew exactly when it happened, it felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger,"" Kittle said. ""The second it happened, I knew exactly what it was... Unfortunate, but football's tough sometimes.""

Whether it's from injury, free agency or potential trade, Kittle's situation isn't the only possible return the 49ers are monitoring this offseason. Starting quarterback Brock Purdy will work to strengthen his right big toe, linebacker Fred Warner's rehab from a broken and dislocated right ankle will continue, quarterback Mac Jones is a candidate to be traded and receiver Jauan Jennings headlines San Francisco's list of pending unrestricted free agents.

Purdy missed eight games this season because of a variant of turf toe in his right big toe. He returned in Week 11 and was able to finish the season without issue. He said Monday he will not need any further operations on the toe.

""[The] toe is good to go,"" Purdy said. ""Obviously, I'll continue to strengthen it and give it some rest and whatnot too, but it's good.""

Jones, meanwhile, enters an offseason that comes with more uncertainty. Stepping in for Purdy for those eight games, Jones kept the 49ers in the playoff mix as they went 5-3 in games he started. He posted a 62.9 QBR (ninth in the NFL) and threw for 13 touchdowns and six interceptions while throwing for 268.9 yards per game in his starts.

That production came after posting QBRs of 38.4, 37.5 and 36.6 in his three previous seasons split between the New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars. While Jones has another season left on the two-year contract he signed with the 49ers in March and says he'd be just fine sticking around for another year, he's aware that his production in Purdy's place could make him a sought-after candidate for quarterback-needy teams in the trade market.

""It was just so fun to get, as I say, the train back on the tracks and that's what I wanted to do,"" Jones said. ""I put a lot of good film out there... Had a lot of fun and excited for what's next. And I don't know, I'm on a two-year deal, but I do believe I'm a starter in this league and I'm excited for continuing to get better this offseason and see what happens.""

Jennings will have far more say in the next step in his career. He missed most of training camp as he battled a hamstring injury and sought a lucrative contract extension from the Niners. He ultimately played the season out after getting some sweeteners added but also played through shoulder, ankle and rib injuries as he finished with 55 receptions for 643 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns.

If the 49ers and Jennings can't reach agreement on a new deal before March, he would become an unrestricted free agent for the first time. And though the Niners figure to have plenty of need at receiver, there's a chance Jennings won't be back.

That possibility was made clear as Jennings got emotional talking about what his six seasons in San Francisco mean to him on Monday afternoon.

""It means everything,"" Jennings said. ""It's nothing like Santa Clara. First flew in here, I was thinking I was going to San Francisco just like everybody else. And you find out fast it's Santa Clara. Now it's home. It quickly turned into home and a run I'll never forget for sure.""

Like Kittle, another Niner who will be back in 2026 is Warner. His attempt to speed up his recovery from the devastating ankle injury he suffered in Week 6 came up just short after the 49ers lost to Seattle on Saturday night.

Now, Warner can pump the brakes and enjoy a more traditional rehab process.

""No extra surgeries are needed,"" Warner said. ""I think my rehab had gotten obviously super accelerated to try to make the NFC Championship Game. Now, I just get to kind of slow things down and really just work on all the little things that I didn't get to work on before all this happened. It's just business as usual.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0119%2Fr1602868_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 05:59:58.711914

Bill Speros writes: ""The Patriots haven’t lost a game on the road since Dec. 22, 2024, and own the best NFL record ATS at 13-5-1. This early line movement shows how much New England’s defense impressed oddsmakers. Denver, meanwhile, remains deep underwater on the number at 8-9. The Broncos (-1.5) covered in their wild and woolly 33-30 OT win over the Bills. But even there, they may have gotten a boost, given no one seems to know what constitutes a reception these days. Weather (45 and sunny) won’t be a factor. Don’t be surprised to see this total get eclipsed with plenty of time to spare. New England’s defense delivers in the thin air at Mile High, but the Broncos (thanks in part to the atomic leg of kicker Wil Lutz) nab a backdoor cover. Meanwhile, the Patriots return to the Super Bowl. Everything old is new again.""

But you just feel for feel for the guy, for the person.
""That's part of the reason we brought him here is just to provide great running back depth"" Macdonald said of the two backs.
Another possibility at running back could be second-year running back George Holani who is currently eligible to come off of injured reserve.
All season long Macdonald has credited the effort of the team as the reason the Seahawks have gotten this far.","1. Mike Macdonald is ""pretty sure"" Zach Charbonnet's knee injury in an ACL.

On Monday morning, head coach Mike Macdonald announced that Seahawks running back Zach Charbonnet would be out the remainder of the season with a “significant knee injury.”

And during his Monday press conference, he gave a little more clarity on what the injury is.

""Pretty sure it's ACL,"" he said. ""We're figuring out what the extent of the injury is and we'll get all the details on when he's going to get it fixed and all that. But you just feel for feel for the guy, for the person. This guy's just a absolute stud. But he's around and he's in good spirits and we got his back.""

Right now, Kenneth Walker III is the only running back on the 53-man roster but Seattle has Velus Jones Jr. and Cam Akers on the practice squad.

""That's part of the reason we brought him here is just to provide great running back depth"" Macdonald said of the two backs. ""Both are really good players in their own right. And they got a great opportunity in front of them. So you hate it to be under these circumstances, but it is what it is. We got to move forward. So they'll be ready to go.""

Another possibility at running back could be second-year running back George Holani who is currently eligible to come off of injured reserve.

""George is an option."" Macdonald said. ""We'll see how it goes this week.""

When asked if Holani is physically up to speed, Macdonald said, ""I think we'll just let it play out this week on how everything goes but probably hear from that over the next few days.""

As far as other injuries go, Macdonald said they're working through other players being, ""banged up.""

""So we'll kind of play that day by day.""

And Josh Jones ,who was injured in the divisional game, could make a return this week.

""We got to see how it is on Wednesday. If he's good enough to practice, great. If not, we got to move, go to third ... It's kind of where we're at right now.""

Macdonald also said Charles Cross who left the game out of, ""precaution"" with a foot injury would not need to practice in order to play this week.

2. Kenneth Walker III worked on himself during the offseason and now it's, ""paying dividends.""

During training camp, Kenneth Walker III shared that he was being intentional about the food he was eating and prioritizing sleep in an effort to be healthier this season. He missed six games last season due to injury.

""I definitely feel it in my performance, so I'm going to just keep it up and go into it with the season.""

He added, ""It's more like a routine. Here, you get more healthy, clean foods at the facility and then my sleeping habits; I (go to) sleep at around 10 to 10:30 (p.m.). These past years, even in college, I used to stay up until 1:00 (a.m.) because I'm just staying up. It's definitely helped a lot, and I feel much better and extra recovery definitely helps a lot when I come back out here and practice again.""

Now 18 games later, Walker has played in every matchup and has managed to stay healthy and available all while racking up 1,027 rushing yards during the regular season. And on Saturday, he rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns.

Macdonald said, ""I know he was working through his foot at the beginning over the course of the offseason and that was frustrating for him because of the amount of work that he was putting in. And I think hopefully he realizes the dividends that that's paid, that work that he's put in to really get himself in a good spot up to this point, because what I've seen, I've seen a guy that's, he's gotten better throughout the season, so you can't say that about all runners. And so that's a tribute to him and how he's taken care of his body.

3. Seahawks effort has gotten them this far.

All season long Macdonald has credited the effort of the team as the reason the Seahawks have gotten this far. He says the player's mindset to get this far started in the offseason when majority of the team participated in volunteer offseason workouts. And as the name suggests, players have no obligation to participate, but all chose to.

That buy-in translated to the season and the effort they've all decided to give every game.

""I don't think I'd be standing here right now talking to you guys if our team hasn't decided to play with that type of effort. And that's really all three phases. So that's a decision that they've made that they want to play to.""

Following games, in team meetings, Macdonald will usually show plays to the team that he would describe as, ""shocking effort"" and from this past game one of those plays was at the end of a Walker run, the entire offensive line helped push the ball forward for a few extra yards, despite already gaining the first down.

""No, that was awesome,"" Macdonald said. ""Just every yard matters. So guys are fired up to watch that one.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/utvnv92wxavalcdgvesd,N,,2026-01-20 01:00:17.958140

More Seahawks on SI stories Seahawks vs. Rams III: Early odds for NFC Championship released Sam Darnold one of NFL’s biggest winners from divisional round What separates the Seahawks from Rams, Broncos & Patriots","If Sam Darnold was bothered by his oblique injury during the Seattle Seahawks' dismantling of the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday night he did a good job of hiding it.

Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak did his part in protecting Seattle's new franchise quarterback by dialing up a run-heay game plan. Ken Walker followed through with the best game any Seahawks running back has had in the playoffs in 20 years, roasting he Niners for nearly 150 scrimmage yards and scoring three touchdowns.

For Darnold's part he only had to throw 17 pass attempts - and only a couple of them really challenged his throwing power. Darnold's bullet to Jaxon Smith-Njigba in the end zone should lay to rest any concerns about how much torque he can put into a pass.

Odds are Darnold had some help from the Seahawks' training staff, though in the form of a Toradol shot. Here's what one anonymous NFL executive thinks the team did to get Darnold through the game, according to Mike Sando at The Athletic.

""He didn't throw a pass until 45 minutes before kickoff,"" an exec from another team said. ""That tells me they gave him the shot an hour before the game. You have a strategy where you are trying to time it up. You want to wait as long as you can before giving him the shot.""

This makes sense, and explains why Darnold wasn't out on the field warming up with Drew Lock, Jalen Milroe and the rest of the Seahawks offense.

That development brought on a lot of anxiety from Seattle's fanbase, but it turned out to be a nothing-burger of a story. Whether it was Toradol or a simple case of the injury being made out to be more than it was, Darnold showed no signs of being limited by his oblique issue.

Even if Darnold hadn't been able to play, odds are the result would not have been much different. Drew Lock could have thrown three pick-sixes in Darnold's place and the Seahawks still would have won comfortably by two touchdowns.

Looking ahead, Darnold faces Round 3 of the toughest challenge he's faced in this phase of his career. His two worst games this season have both come against the Rams, throwing six of his 14 interceptions against them. If Darnold can just play one more clean game the Seahawks will be on their way to the Super Bowl.

The 21-year-old Williams spoke to reporters Monday as the 49ers cleaned out their lockers, describing what he has gone through after the most severe injury of his young career -- and how Bosa, who now has torn his ACL three times, is helping him through it.

""I ain't going to lie to you, it's been hard,"" Williams said. ""It's been hard dealing with something like this, of this significance. Probably the biggest injury I've ever had, and then just the time table that it takes [to return]. Then missing all the important games that I'm missing, and just the events that I'm missing with the guys out there. It would have been nice to be a part of it.""

Williams, San Francisco's first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, was just one of several high-profile injuries the 49ers overcame en route to an improbable NFC playoff run, which ended with a 41-6 divisional-round loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday at Lumen Field.

But sidelined right along with him was fellow defensive end Bosa, who already served as a mentor for the young lineman and continued that role throughout their rehab.

""It helped me a lot, man,"" Williams said of leaning on Bosa. ""Bosa has been extremely helpful. He's like a real big brother. He looks out, he comes in, checks on me, sits down, eats lunch with me, talks to me, asks me about my knee, asks me how I'm feeling, like where I'm at in the process. ...

""I'll be feeling more comfortable leaning on him and asking him for stuff versus a lot of other people. So I just come to Bosa and lean on him, and ask him because he's been through it. He knows exactly what it felt like and how to how to move on.""

Find the latest San Francisco 49ers news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California.

Before tearing his ACL in the fourth quarter of the 49ers' 34-24 win over the New York Giants on Nov. 2, Williams had recorded one sack, one fumble recovery, 20 combined tackles (four for a loss) and three quarterback hits as one of three defensive linemen drafted by San Francisco before the season's start.

The 49ers relied heavily on the rookies in a year where youth was their MO, and coach Kyle Shanahan was pleased with what he saw from Williams as he adjusted to the NFL and dealt with numerous injuries, not just the ACL tear.

""We knew we needed a starting defensive end, that's what our goal was, and we also felt we needed some pass rushers who could play inside on third down,” Shanahan told NBC Sports Bay Area's Matt Maiocco on ""49ers Game Plan"" after the injury.

“We also wanted to bring in a good person with high character, high football character to our building. All he has shown us right away is the type of guy he is. Sometimes you got to see guys go through adversity to see how they'll grind and things like that, we got to see that.”

Williams showed the 49ers in a short time that he can be the player they need, and now, he'll continue studying film and learning from teammates like Bosa in an effort to return even better than before.",https://media.nbcsportsbayarea.com/2026/01/mykel-williams-nick-bosa-GettyImages-2227976019-e1768872478293.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-20 01:00:25.652216

Harrison put on 11 pounds of muscle, he had the foundation of what he learned as a rookie, and the Cardinals as a team were in a good spot.
Despite all that, wide receivers coach Drew Terrell noted in December Harrison had made significant progress in his NFL game.
""I didn't feel like I played the whole season,"" Harrison said.
As Harrison wrapped up his media scrum, he was given another chance to describe the season.","As Marvin Harrison Jr. stood in front of his locker one final time for the 2025 season, his body having betrayed him down the stretch, the wide receiver tried to succinctly sum up his second NFL year.

""It was an incomplete season for me, really,"" he said.

That's far from what Harrison – and the Cardinals, for that matter – was expecting when the year began. Harrison put on 11 pounds of muscle, he had the foundation of what he learned as a rookie, and the Cardinals as a team were in a good spot.

The wins didn't come however, and neither did the Harrison jump. He had moments when his inconsistency seemed to weigh on him, moments when he seemed he was breaking out to a new level. Then came the injuries: a concussion, the surprise appendicitis, and then heel problems on both feet.

He played 11 games, but four of those were impacted by injury issues. He ended up with 41 receptions for 608 yards and four touchdowns, behind the stellar years of tight end Trey McBride and fellow wideout Michael Wilson.

""It's been a mental battle,"" Harrison said.

Despite all that, wide receivers coach Drew Terrell noted in December Harrison had made significant progress in his NFL game.

""There were a lot of things he had to learn, he had to adapt his way of thinking,"" Terrell said. ""I've seen the biggest change from him is probably his mindset and how he thinks about football, which has been good.

""He's playing a more free style of football.""

The appendicitis derailed Harrison harsher than just the two games he missed. He lost 10 pounds, or nearly all the muscle he had gained in his grind-it-out offseason. He didn't do much over those two weeks and tried to jump right back in.

In his first game back, he hurt his heel.

Wilson's ascension ran a parallel track to Harrison's body breakdown, with Wilson moving to WR1 and excelling. That at least gave Harrison a vicarious thrill.

""I know Mike's process more than most and he definitely deserved all the credit he is getting,"" he said. ""Kept putting good things on tape, approached the game the right way, and I couldn't be more proud of Mike and what he accomplished. He deserves it.""

Whatever the Cardinals get in a new coach and whatever offense they might run next season, the new staff will at least start with two pass catchers coming off huge years and a third – Harrison – who still very much has that potential.

""I didn't feel like I played the whole season,"" Harrison said. ""That's part of the league, and you have to be consistent.""

As Harrison wrapped up his media scrum, he was given another chance to describe the season.

Head coach Mike Macdonald confirmed that Charbonnet will miss the remainder of the playoffs, which is a big loss considering the two-headed monster Seattle has been using all year in the backfield.

Charbonnet and Kenneth Walker III have been one of the best running back tandems in the NFL this season, with the former leading the team in rushing touchdowns (12) during the regular season.

Macdonald, who didn’t specify what Charbonnet’s injury was, said that he would be facing a ""long road back,"" which could mean he’s missing all of next season as well.

Charbonnet and Walker led the way for the 10th-best rushing team in the NFL this season, tallying 2,096 yards on the ground. Walker had 1,027 for the Seahawks, though Charbonnet was trusted by offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak in the red area, punching in 12 of 19 rushing scores.

Harrison dealt with three different injuries throughout the season, in addition to leaving a game because of a concussion.
Despite underperforming compared with his rookie season statistically, Harrison felt like he ""definitely improved"" in areas he focused on in the offseason.
Heading into last offseason, Terrell said he wanted Harrison to exhale and adopt the mantra of: ""I'm Marvin Harrison Jr.
But heading into this offseason, Terrell wants much of the same out of Harrison as he did last year.","TEMPE, Ariz. -- Marvin Harrison Jr. learned this season what kind of toll injuries can take on a player, physically and mentally.

But it wasn't just one ailment that set back the Cardinals' receiver. Or two, for that matter. Harrison dealt with three different injuries throughout the season, in addition to leaving a game because of a concussion. In all, they caused him to miss five games and prevented Harrison from taking the Year 2 jump that was anticipated heading into the 2025 season.

The injuries also led to Harrison feeling like he didn't completely fulfill his second year in the NFL. He finished with 41 catches for 608 yards and 4 touchdowns but didn't have a 100-yard game.

""I feel like [it was an] incomplete season for me, really,"" Harrison said.

Despite underperforming compared with his rookie season statistically, Harrison felt like he ""definitely improved"" in areas he focused on in the offseason.

Wide receivers coach Drew Terrell agreed.

""I've seen a lot of progress from Marv,"" Terrell said. ""There's a lot of things that he had to learn in the first year. He's had to adapt his way of thinking about certain things. So, I've seen the biggest change for him probably in his mindset and the way he thinks about football, which has been good. Unfortunately, he's had injuries, but he's had games prior to the injury ... where he's playing a more free style of football. So, I'm encouraged by what he's done in his second year.""

The injuries, however, were just too much for Harrison to overcome.

He suffered a concussion during Arizona's Week 6 trip to Indianapolis. Then, a day after the Cardinals' loss at Seattle in Week 9, Harrison was in the hospital because of an appendicitis procedure that sidelined him for two weeks. That was a major blow to Harrison's season, causing him to lose 10 pounds -- about the same amount of weight he put on in the offseason -- and forcing him to go ""back to square one a little bit."" Harrison said he never had a chance to ""really"" recover before he had to jump back into football.

He returned from appendicitis with a different demeanor and ""a look on his face [like] nobody's covering me today,"" Terrell said.

""It was very encouraging,"" Terrell added.

And then, in his first game back from appendicitis at Tampa Bay, Harrison suffered a heel injury that kept him out for two more games.

In a sign to Terrell that Harrison had grown from his rookie year, he said Harrison was ""a lot calmer"" after his first heel injury than he was after the appendicitis.

""He [was] like, 'All right, there's a lot of things that happened that people will talk about or things that happened and I can't do anything about, so let me just take each day for what it is and try to capitalize on the day,'"" Terrell recalled.

After missing two games because of his first heel injury, Harrison returned for two games but left the Week 17 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals because of an injury to his other heel.

Dealing with that many injuries and fluctuating between the field and the training room wore on Harrison.

""Obviously, been a mental battle,"" Harrison said. ""I never really dealt with injuries before. Obviously, appendix, I can't really control that one at all. It just kind of happened at a bad time and then to injure both your heels is unfortunate, as well, but that's just kind of how the way things work sometimes, but you got to keep pushing forward.""

Harrison said rest is the key to his heels healing, but that won't prevent him from taking a break from football mentally early in the offseason.

Heading into last offseason, Terrell said he wanted Harrison to exhale and adopt the mantra of: ""I'm Marvin Harrison Jr. I'm a bad mother, and they got to feel me next time I'm out there.""

To some degree, Harrison heeded Terrell's advice. But heading into this offseason, Terrell wants much of the same out of Harrison as he did last year.

Much of the NFL talk during the playoffs has been about the nine head coach openings (now down to seven), and for good reason. Good coaching matters.

The Denver Broncos and New England Patriots are evidence of that.

Sean Payton was dealt a tough hand with Russell Wilson’s albatross of a contract and a loss of draft picks. Mike Vrabel took over a franchise that was 8-26 in the previous two seasons.

And yet here we are, with both teams 14-3 in the regular season and now playing to represent the AFC in the Super Bowl.

The Broncos will need more production from their running backs against the Patriots, regardless of whether Dobbins is activated and able to contribute.","The Denver Broncos are opening the 21-day return-to-play window for running back J.K. Dobbins, a league source confirmed.

It is unclear yet whether Dobbins, who suffered a Lisfranc foot injury in early November and underwent surgery, will be activated to play in Sunday’s AFC Championship Game in Denver against the New England Patriots, but the opening of the veteran’s return window makes him eligible to practice with the team.

Dobbins was seen working last week on a side field during the media-viewing portion of practices for the first time since his injury, which occurred in Week 10 when he was dragged down by Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Tyree Wilson on what Dobbins claimed was a hip-drop tackle. A penalty was not called, and Wilson wasn’t fined for the tackle.

When surgery was scheduled after the injury, the league source said the hope was that Dobbins could be available if the Broncos reached the Super Bowl. Dobbins has been telling people inside team headquarters in recent weeks that he could return sooner. Coach Sean Payton said a week before Denver’s divisional round playoff win against the Buffalo Bills that Dobbins was “getting close.”

Despite not playing in the final seven games of the season, Dobbins still finished as the team’s leading rusher. His 772 rushing yards ranked fifth in the NFL through Week 10 and left him on pace to easily become Denver’s first 1,000-yard rusher since Phillip Lindsay in 2019. Dobbins ran for fewer than 60 yards only once in his 10 games.

“J.K. is a huge energy piece for our team,” right tackle Mike McGlinchey said Monday. “I’ll leave all the discussion up to the trainers and the staff on that, but he’s obviously a huge piece of what we’ve done. He’s an incredible teammate, and he’s been working his butt off to be able to have a chance to get back.”

Dobbins on Monday afternoon posted a picture to his Instagram account that depicted the running back emerging from the tunnel at Empower Field at Mile High. It had a one-word caption: Soon.

The Broncos will need more production from their running backs against the Patriots, regardless of whether Dobbins is activated and able to contribute. The team’s running backs carried the ball a combined 10 times for 41 yards in Saturday’s victory against the Bills, numbers that should increase with Denver starting backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham for the injured Bo Nix.

McGlinchey, who was the first Broncos player to speak publicly since the starting quarterback’s injury, called it “incredibly heartbreaking” to lose Nix after such a euphoric victory.

“It’s the crappy part of our game,” the veteran tackle said. “… He’ll be back better than ever when this is all said and done.”

McGlinchey also echoed the confidence Payton has voiced in Stidham since the injury. Stidham joined the Broncos as a free agent at the same time the right tackle did in 2023.

“Stiddy has been waiting for this moment the entirety of his career,” McGlinchey said. “He’s more prepared than anyone would be in this situation. He can ball. He flat-out can play quarterback. We’ve seen it every single day in practice. We’ve seen it in training camp. We’ve seen it in the preseason. I have no doubts that he’s going to go out there and play his butt off. Our team is in the perfect position with Stiddy moving forward.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/19152111/GettyImages-2234534935-scaled-e1768854100499.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-19 21:58:35.888346

1. Sean Payton announced Bo Nix has a fracture in his ankle: Nix injured his ankle on a two-yard loss in overtime, just before throwing a deep pass to wide receiver Marvin Mims that resulted in a pass interference, setting up a game-winning field goal. After the play, Nix came up limping slightly, and (looking back) he had a much more pronounced limp after centering the ball for kicker Wil Lutz's field goal attempt.

2. Bo Nix is scheduled for surgery on Tuesday: In his second media appearance of the night on Saturday, Payton confirmed Nix will have surgery on Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama, performed by Dr. Norman Waldrop. The surgery will end Nix's 2025 season, a campaign that ended up in the Broncos' and league history books.

3. Dr. Norman Waldrop is well-known among NFL quarterbacks: Dr. Waldrop was the surgeon who performed the turf toe surgery of Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow earlier this season. Burrow came back ahead of schedule, and played the final six games of the 2025 campaign. Dr. Waldrop has also worked on Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and former Tennessee Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill, among others. Waldrop has also worked with the New Orleans Saints.

4. Dr. Waldrop previously practiced in Colorado: Dr. Waldrop also practiced at Vail, Colorado's The Steadman Clinic, a center ""world-renowned"" for its surgeons & Orthopaedic Surgery. Waldrop was mentored by Dr. Thomas Clanton, who is known for his work on the foot and ankle. Clanton also served as the team orthopaedist for the Houston Texans.

5. Bo Nix's recovery timeline: As Payton is wont to do, he played the details of Nix's recovery close to the vest. “Listen, the surgeon gets his hands on the X-rays,” said Payton during a media conference call on Sunday. “We have enough information for everyone. The focus is on the next week’s game.”

For now, the Broncos will do exactly what Payton said, and turn their attention toward the Patriots. The two teams have been nipping at each other's heels through the regular season. Now, they are set to meet and play for the right to be the AFC's representative in Super Bowl LX, and Nix will focus on surgery and recovery.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/19/SBRC/88252888007-bo-nix-surgery-details.jpg?crop=4548,2559,x0,y161&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-19 19:59:52.399902

The Pro Bowl quarterback who played through an oblique injury on his non-throwing side while the Seahawks beat San Francisco in the divisional playoffs Saturday night came out the game fine.

That was coach Mike Macdonald’s update on Darnold Monday morning.

“To my knowledge, he’s good,” Macdonald said told KIRO-AM radio.

“He didn’t make it worse or anything. But I’m sure he’s sore.”

Darnold felt discomfort in his oblique on his left side Thursday during practice, throwing to a receiver “against air,” with no defenders. He immediately walked off the field into the team’s training room at its headquarters in Renton for treatment. Veteran backup Drew Lock ran the starting offense for the rest of that final, full practice before the 49ers game. Darnold didn’t throw from feeling it Thursday until about an hour and 45 minutes before kickoff Saturday afternoon.

He played into the fourth quarter. Lock replaced him near the end of the Seahawks’ blowout win. When asked following the Seahawks’ 41-6 victory that advanced Seattle into the NFC championship game Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams at Lumen Field what his level of pain was during Saturday night’s game, Darnold said: “I felt fine.”

Darnold said he and the team would need to continue managing the injury this week heading into him starting the NFC title game.

His coach said the same thing Monday morning.

“It’s something that we’re gonna have to navigate the rest of the week,” Macdonald said on KIRO.

It remains to be seen how much practice time Darnold misses and how much Lock runs the starting offense this week. “Navigating” the injury likely means Darnold won’t be on his normal throwing schedule Wednesday, Thursday and Friday leading into the Sunday title game.

Sam Darnold’s injury game

Saturday before the 49ers game, Lock and rookie third-stringer Jalen Milroe were Seattle’s quarterbacks on the field for early warmups in sweatsuits about an hour and 45 minutes prior to kickoff. Darnold wasn’t with them as he otherwise always is. He was inside, in the locker room, throwing passes in there to test his side.

He came out about 40 minutes before kickoff as usual with his teammates in full pads for final warmup drills. He softly threw passes then started the game, as he has all 18 games in his first Seahawks season.

Darnold completed 12 of 17 passes, 124 yards, with a dart of a touchdown throw through coverage to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. That put Seattle ahead 17-0 in the second quarter.

“Honestly, it surprised me. Not how hard he threw it because he was hurt. I was like, ‘Wow, how’s he going to fit it through this window,” Smith-Njigba said. “And he happened to do it, again. That was awesome.”

Darnold seemed to loosen up as the game went on. His first attempt in the game: A deep pass 20-plus yards down the seam he intended to throw to Smith-Njigba breaking free behind his defender for a possible touchdown. Darnold’s throw died softly, well short of the receiver and the 49ers defensive back.

That seemed to be on the quarterback’s mind later in that first offensive possession for Seattle. Darnold had Smith-Njigba breaking open deep early on a roll-out pass to the QB’s right. It would have been another 20-plus-yard throw. Instead, Darnold chose to throw an 8-yard pass to Cooper Kupp.

Seattle’s defense dominated San Francisco, and Darnold got the first postseason victory of his eight-year NFL career playing for five teams.

While Macdonald didn't reveal the exact nature of the injury, he said Charbonnet would face ""a long road back,"" potentially hinting at the running back missing time next season.

Throughout the regular season, Charbonnet and Kenneth Walker combined to give the Seahawks a fearsome rushing attack. The team ranked 10th in the NFL with 2,096 rushing yards in 2025. Walker led the way with 1,027 yards, but Charbonnet was the hammer, scoring 12 of the team's 19 rushing scores.

Since being selected in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft, Charbonnet has emerged as a strong power option and the perfect complement to the shifty Walker. After a quiet rookie season, Charbonnet showed promise in his second year, rushing for 569 yards and scoring eight touchdowns while filling in for an injured Walker.

Both players stayed healthy in 2025, but that didn't stop Charbonnet from putting up the best season of his career. The third-year pro rushed for a career-high 730 yards and scored 12 touchdowns.

With the Seahawks securing the No. 1 seed in the NFC, Charbonnet was able to rest during the wild-card games. He returned to action against the 49ers, but carried the ball just five times for 20 yards in the contest. He left the game late in the first half, after taking a big hit.

The play shouldn’t have ever happened if the officiating crew had done its job earlier on that drive.

”You can’t blame the officials,” Brown said after the game. “That’s not what I try to do. But you’re letting the guys play all game long. I was holding the piss out of some people today and they didn’t call it. There was a third down right before we kicked the field goal -- I was holding Cooper hard and they didn’t call that. They were letting the boys play, but that’s a well-coached team. They knew where we were at and where they were at on the field. I think those passes were not really thrown to be caught. I think they were thrown to go out there and make us make a mistake and get a little help from the zebras. I thought they called a good game for the whole time. Those things are going to happen.”

He mentioned the hold on Jonathon Cooper and that was bad enough, but he smartly forgot about the worst no-call hold of the game. It came on that overtime drive and happened in the end zone.

Instead, we get a week of the national media whining about an interception that seems pretty clear on reply. Sure you can grab a still shot of the ball not moving, but if you play it the ball is moving until one person gains possession of it. That person was Ja’Quan McMillian.

What they should be complaining about is how the Broncos were robbed of their franchise quarterback playing in the conference title game because the officiating crew refused to call holding penalties even for the most egregious acts of holding you’ll see in any game.

Despite missing the final seven games, Dobbins finished the regular season as the Broncos' leading rusher with 772 yards on 153 carries. Rookie RJ Harvey stepped up in his absence and rushed for 540 yards and seven touchdowns. Denver did not do much on the ground in the 33-30 divisional-round victory over Buffalo on Saturday, as Nix led the Broncos in rushing with 29 yards on 12 carries. Jaleel McLaughlin rushed four times for 21 yards, while Harvey rushed six times for 20 yards.

The Broncos ranked top 10 in rushing yards per game and yards per rush when Dobbins suffered his foot injury. The Broncos finished bottom 10 in both categories after Dobbins went down.

It remains to be seen how spry Dobbins will be if he does in fact return to the lineup this weekend, but running the ball vs. the Patriots will be important with the Broncos starting Jarrett Stidham at quarterback.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/19/3e94eb1f-a82f-47dc-a2b1-def3f47f5a9a/thumbnail/1200x675/4c41615d62442d527ba29ca917a74877/jk.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 18:00:30.281487
