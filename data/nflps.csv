As the 2025–26 NFL season comes to a close, free agency is coming into focus, and teams are beginning to evaluate potential targets to address roster deficiencies. Here are the top offensive tackles slated to hit free agency in 2026.

For now, each player’s profile includes three-year snap counts and three-year PFF grades, offering a broader, more stable view of performance than a single-season spike or dip.

Click here for PFF's full list of the top 250 free agents.

1. Rasheed Walker, Green Bay Packers

Snaps: 3,170 | PFF grade: 69.8

Walker will need to clean up his run blocking, where he earned no better than a 56.3 PFF grade in any of the past three seasons, but the team that signs him (or re-signs him) will look forward to getting a relatively consistent left tackle in pass protection.

2. Jermaine Eluemunor, New York Giants

Snaps: 2,918 | PFF grade: 70.8

Despite a disastrous 2025 season in New York that included the midseason firing of Brian Daboll, Jermaine Eluemunor was a clear bright spot along the Giants' offensive line. New York ranked fifth in PFF pass-blocking grade, with Eluemunor playing a central role. He sits 16th among qualified tackles in pass-blocking grade (76.8) since 2024 and is tied for seventh in pressure rate allowed (4.3%). He has also graded in the 74th percentile on true pass sets and the 79th percentile overall as a pass-blocker over the past two seasons.

3. Braxton Jones, ChicagoBears

Snaps: 1,653 | PFF grade: 74.6

Jones played just 210 snaps in 2025 after suffering a knee injury in Week 4, but he was effective when healthy in prior action. As a starter in 2024, he earned an 80.8 PFF pass-blocking grade and a 70.2 PFF run-blocking grade. While the 26-year-old will need to improve his pressure-to-sack conversion rate, his track record could still warrant a starting opportunity.

4. Rob Havenstein, Los Angeles Rams

Snaps: 2,180 | PFF grade: 76.9

Havenstein appeared in just seven games during the 2025 season after dealing with an ankle injury, but he was more consistent in the years prior. From 2020 to 2024, the Rams' right tackle earned an overall PFF grade of 86.1 along with a 90.2 PFF run-blocking mark. While the 33-year-old has been less effective in pass protection, he could still draw interest as a starting option on the edge.

As Drake Maye and the Patriots begin their prep work for Super Bowl LX, the 23-year-old quarterback’s health has now become an early storyline before the team makes the trek to Santa Clara this weekend.

Several doctors on social media — including former Chargers team doctor David Chao — noted over the weekend that Maye might have injured his shoulder during Sunday’s victory over the Broncos in the AFC championship game.

Speaking during his weekly appearance on “WEEI Afternoons” on Tuesday, Maye downplayed talk of being hindered by any sort of physical ailment.

“I’m feeling good. We’ve got some extra rest. I don’t think it’s from the game. I think it’s just the buildup of throwing, including training camp, 30 weeks straight of throwing and four days a week. It can add up,” Maye said. “But I got some extra rest and I’m feeling good and ready to go for the Super Bowl.”

While Maye brushed aside any discourse regarding his shoulder, he was candid when asked if he might be limited during practices over these next two weeks — be it at Foxborough or in California.

“I think it’s too early to say,” Maye said of his practice status ahead of a Feb. 8 showdown with the Seahawks at Levi’s Stadium.

“Right now I’m feeling good and looking forward to getting out there and preparing for the Seahawks and prepping to get ready to go,” he added.

Maye and the Patriots’ passing game labored on Sunday in Denver, with the MVP candidate completing 10-of-21 throws for 86 yards.

He still avoided any turnovers and used his legs (65 rushing yards) to both score New England’s lone touchdown and ice the game in the fourth quarter with a 3rd-and-6 scamper.

But, if the Patriots want to close out its improbable turnaround season with a Lombardi Trophy, it’s going to need more from an offense that is averaging just 18.0 points per game this postseason.

According to Chao, Maye appeared to hurt his shoulder in the third quarter of Sunday’s win at Empower Field at Mile High after being tackled by Denver linebacker Talanoa Hufanga.

Maye slammed his right shoulder in the ground at the end of the play and was spotted rotating his shoulder and adjusting his shoulder pads after getting off the gridiron.

Two plays later, Maye completed one of New England’s most explosive plays on an otherwise quiet evening for the offense — connecting with Mack Hollins on a 31-yard gain off a flea flicker.

Maye also didn’t seem worse for wear in the fourth quarter — stiff-arming Jonah Ellis on the seven-year run that moved the chains and allowed New England to run out the clock.

Speaking on WEEI Tuesday morning, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel said that none of New England’s players — Maye included — were completely healthy at this stage of the NFL calendar.

During a press conference with the media later that morning, Vrabel was again asked if Maye is healthy in the lead-up to Super Bowl LX.

“No, I wouldn’t say that anybody hurt anything,” Vrabel said. “Again, this is a sport where there’s going to be things that come up.

“We’ll talk about whatever status each player has for the game once we’re required to, we understand that, but we were able to function offensively, throw the football, run the football, so that’s kind of where everybody is at.”",https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/UDOVNSDR52UKKDBPHEDCCOYUUU-6979335376978-768x432.jpg,N,,2026-01-28 00:59:30.863407

Kamara has approximately $67.4 million in career earnings through the end of the 2025 season.

“Given Kamara’s age and price point, New Orleans can’t expect to get more than a conditional late-round pick in return,” Bleacher Report’s Kristopher Knox wrote. “However, they may not need to go far to find a trade partner. The Denver Broncos may need a back to pair with RJ Harvey, as J.K. Dobbins is slated to be a free agent. Kamara, of course, spent a good chunk of his career under former Saints and current Broncos head coach Sean Payton.”

What Kamara Could Bring to the Table

When healthy, Kamara can still be a game changer.

That’s something the Broncos have sorely been missing throughout Payton’s first 3 seasons, save for the 10 games Dobbins played in 2025, when he was on pace to become Denver’s first 1,000-yard rusher since 2019.

Dobbins, it’s worth pointing out, should have his own options in free agency if he wants to go elsewhere, although he’s already expressed a desire to stay in Denver.

Even with his 2025 season factored into the mix — where he had career lows almost across the board — Kamara still has 17-game averages of 1,646 yards of total offense and 12 total touchdowns over his 9-year career.

Bringing Kamara in for the final year of his contract to play for the coach with which he had the most success seems like a risk the Broncos should be willing to take.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2179059132.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780,N,,2026-01-27 23:00:01.395875

Brock & Salk: Darnold’s performance should quiet doubters

During his weekly appearance on Boston’s WEEI-FM, Maye addressed the state of his shoulder in response to online speculation that he was injured during New England’s 10-7 AFC championship game victory over Denver.

“I’m feeling good. … I don’t think it’s from the game,” he said. “I think it’s just the buildup of throwing, including training camp, 30 weeks straight of throwing and four days a week. It can add up. But I got some extra rest and I’m feeling good and ready to go for the Super Bowl.”

He said it was “too early to tell” whether he might be limited in any practices leading up to the Super Bowl against the Seattle Seahawks on Feb. 8. The Patriots return to practice on Thursday.

“I think that everybody, including Drake, is not 100 percent at this part of the year,” coach Mike Vrabel said. “We’ll do everything that we can to help our players be prepared and get ready for this game.”

Maye went 10 of 21 for 86 yards against the Broncos. He also ran 10 times for 65 yards and a touchdown. The second-year QB has not missed a game this season.

Let's take a look at Tuesday's action.

Day 1: Takeaway | QBs | Risers | Notes

Shrine Bowl observations

Tuesday's biggest takeaway

The defensive line class stood out on Day 1. With many of the perceived top players at the position not participating in the Senior Bowl -- only two players (Zion Young, Lee Hunter) in my overall my top 32 are here -- there's an opportunity for risers to increase their draft stock, as there are fewer elite prospects to distract scouts. That's the case for this deep group of defensive linemen.

On Tuesday, Young, Hunter, Caleb Banks (Florida) and T.J. Parker (Clemson) all looked like top-40 players in a class with average talent. But the 2026 class is lacking overall, which could put those four closer to the overall top 25 given their standout play in the first practice session. Hunter was the best player I saw on the field throughout two practices (more on that later), but Parker and Young both won consistently with power and length while using speed to close on the ball in team sessions. And Banks, who is returning from a season-ending foot injury, was as impactful as expected. You're going to hear a lot about this defensive line class in the next three months. Tuesday was a great introduction. -- Miller

Tuesday's best quarterback performance

Tuesday's top performance belonged to Cole Payton (North Dakota State). The lefty passer had two of the most impressive throws of the day, the best coming off a bootleg on a deep ball to Caleb Douglas (Texas Tech). Having played in under-center at North Dakota State, Payton looked comfortable taking snaps and making throws from multiple pre-snap platforms. Even though he has a bit of an elongated and loopy throwing motion, it didn't have a negative effect on his timing.

Payton displayed his accuracy and mobility in multiple sessions. Payton suffered a broken thumb on his throwing hand during the Bison's loss in the FCS playoffs. He showed no signs of that injury. Payton carries grades as early as Round 4, as he's a big athlete that some teams have mentioned as a project worth selecting on Day 3. -- Reid

Day 1 standout prospects

Colton Hood, CB, Tennessee

All eyes were on Hood, my top-ranked player at the Senior Bowl, and he stepped up Tuesday. He showed patience and confidence in one-on-one settings, turning and running with opposing receivers with ease while not being beaten once. The 5-foot-11, 188-pound junior was my No. 18-ranked player entering the week and solidified his status as the best player in Mobile throughout position drills and team settings. The Buccaneers, Jets and Lions all look like strong landing spots for him in the middle of Round 1. -- Miller

Lee Hunter, DT, Texas Tech

I'm always looking for that ""wow"" first impression at all-star games and Hunter delivered it during team drills Tuesday. Lining up as a 1-technique, Hunter absolutely demolished an interior offensive lineman with his first-step power, rocking back the blocker's shoulders and easily gaining ground. That backs up what we saw on tape during Texas Tech's run to the CFP this season. The 6-foot-4, 325-pound Hunter currently ranks No. 29 on my board and boosted his stock even more on Tuesday. --Miller

Ted Hurst, WR, Georgia State

Given that he played at a small school, this week provides a unique opportunity for Hurst. The lengthy wideout (6-foot-3, 207 pounds) made one of the better highlights of the day with a one-handed sideline grab. Hurst's fluidity, especially given his size, has scouts intrigued. He's a strong run-after-catch player, too. With a strong predraft showing, Hurst could move up into the third round from his current spot, which I view as early on Day 3. -- Yates

T.J. Parker, Edge, Clemson

Viewed as one of the nation's top defenders entering the season, Parker didn't have the season many envisioned, with his sack total falling from 11 in 2024 to five last season. Parker took a positive step toward reviving his draft prospects on the first day of practice Tuesday, as the 6-foot-3, 265-pounder displayed lots of power in his hands. That strength was present throughout multiple periods of practice. Scouts view Parker as a top-40 prospect who could sneak into the back end of Round 1. -- Reid

Keylan Rutledge, IOL, Georgia Tech

After playing guard exclusively during his career at Georgia Tech, the 6-foot-4, 320-pound Rutledge took snaps at center throughout practice Tuesday. Rutledge showed comfort with snapping the ball and demonstrated that he can play any spot along the interior, answering one of the biggest questions scouts had about him entering the Senior Bowl. -- Reid

Quick-hitters from Day 1

Miller:

Offensive linemen usually start Senior Bowl week slowly while defensive linemen explode onto the scene with speed and power. It's best to allow offensive linemen to settle in, and that's what happened with Beau Stephens (Iowa). The guard prospect had a rough rep against Hunter early before settling down and winning with leverage and power against Zane Durant (Penn State) and others in one-on-ones. Stephens is a Day 3 prospect but showed impressive poise Tuesday.

Speaking of Durant, I must single him out for his Day 1 performance. The 6-foot-1, 290-pound defensive tackle won consistently at 3-technique with quickness and leverage throughout the practice against a good group of interior linemen. Durant currently sits as an early Day 3 player on my board but looked more like a top-100 prospect in his initial practice.

Reid:

Edge rusher Nadame Tucker (Western Michigan) caught my eye multiple times Tuesday. Opportunities like this are important for small-school prospects because they present major tests against high-level competition. The 6-foot-3, 250-pound Tucker entered the week as one of the event's lesser-known names but opened many eyes during the first day of practice. He could interest teams looking for a midround pass rusher.

Wide receiver Malachi Fields (Notre Dame) was the best offensive player on the American team on Day 1. Officially measuring 6-foot-4, 218 pounds, Fields used his frame well. He was challenged multiple times at the line of scrimmage during one-on-ones against the corners. His physicality showed up, and he was able to fight through jam attempts prior to making strong catches. Fields carries a mixture of mid-to-late Day 2 grades as a prospect who continues to trend upward.

Wide receiver Kevin Coleman Jr. (Missouri) quietly had a strong first day. A well-traveled prospect, he started his career at Jackson State (2022) before transferring to Louisville (2023) and Mississippi State (2024) before landing at Missouri. Coleman is a smooth route runner who spent time on the outside and in the slot during practice. He also looked comfortable fielding punts on a chilly and windy day. In speaking to scouts, Coleman is primarily viewed as an early-to-mid Day 3 prospect, which is where I also have him currently.

Yates:

Edge rusher Zion Young (Missouri) brought ferocious energy to the one-on-ones, as he showed the power that made him a great college player. Young wins with knock-back power and length as a rusher, which he used to land an offensive tackle on his back in a one-on-one rep. I think Young will go early in Round 2.

Gennings Dunker is the next in a long line of talented Iowa offensive linemen, and I liked what I saw from him in pass protection Tuesday. Dunker showed good lateral agility and the length to ward off edge rushers, plus a toughness and finish on his reps (as well as an off-the-charts mullet). He's another Day 2 prospect for me.

Shrine Bowl observations

I spent three days at the Shrine Bowl last week and the talent didn't disappoint. Cornerback Avery Smith (Toledo) was the week's biggest winner. He had no problem with the bump in competition, showing that he was capable of playing press man and in zone coverage. The 5-foot-10, 185-pound Smith was the prospect scouts were buzzing about the most and might have played his way into the top 100.

Offensive lineman Brian Parker II (Duke) also stood out. After spending last season at left tackle, the 6-foot-5, 300-pound Parker played center at Shrine Bowl practices, showing strong hands and a balanced base. He was viewed as a Day 3 prospect entering the event but boosted his stock and could go as early as Round 3.

On the quarterback front, Cade Klubnik (Clemson) recovered from a subpar Day 1 and had a strong final two days of practice. A streaky thrower, the 6-foot-2, 210-pound Klubnik had multiple excellent throws during the team portions of practice. He showed plenty of emotion after each impressive throw and certainly helped his standing. Opinions remained mixed on where Klubnik will go. Some scouts had third-round grades on him, but there were others who saw him as a mid-Day 3 passer. -- Reid

Maye appeared on WEEI Afternoons on Tuesday and affirmed that he is healthy following speculation that he suffered a shoulder ailment in the Patriots' 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos.

""I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good. We gonna get some extra rest, and really the only thing that's from the game, I think just the build up of throwing for, this is what, almost, including training camp, thirty weeks straight of throwing and four days a week. It can add up. But I've got some extra rest. I'm feeling good, and yeah, ready to go for the Super Bowl,"" Maye said.

In an attempt to solidify the win, Maye stiff-armed Broncos linebacker Jonah Elliss while heading for the out-of-bounds line on third down with 1:51 to go in the fourth quarter. The first down gain allowed New England to punch their ticket to the Super Bowl.

Pro football doctor David Chao said in the aftermath of New England's win that the AP NFL MVP finalist injured his shoulder on the play. Patriots coach Mike Vrabel later stated that the injury talk was ""probably"" overblown when speaking with media members on Tuesday.

“I am far more concerned about Drake May’s right shoulder than Sam Darnold’s oblique heading into the Super Bowl.","Drake Maye’s Super Bowl status is under scrutiny after the Patriots QB clutched his throwing shoulder in the AFC Championship. While no official diagnosis has been released, NFL doctors suggest a possible sprain rather than a serious tear. His season-low passing numbers added to concern, leaving New England cautiously waiting as the Super Bowl approaches.

The New England Patriots are celebrating another playoff breakthrough, but inside the organization, concern has quietly replaced confidence. It was all focus on Drake Maye in the AFC Championship when all focus was not on the scoreboard, but the rookie quarter back Drake Maye had his throwing shoulder after being hit. The time was short, but its effect has been long since the last whistle. With the Super Bowl approaching, the Patriots are walking a fine line between optimism and uncertainty. Maye finished the game without leaving the field, yet his body language told a different story. Coaches have remained cautious, and medical silence from the team has only fueled speculation. Now, outside experts are stepping in to fill the information gap.

Medical experts weigh in as concern grows around Drake Maye

The timing could not be more delicate. Maye enters the biggest game of his young career with questions surrounding his health, his protection, and whether his shoulder can handle another four quarters under pressure. One of the first detailed evaluations came from Dr. Jesse Morse, who reviewed the play and offered cautious reassurance while outlining real risks. “Most likely possibilities: posterior capsular sprain or superior/posterior labral tear (10-11 o’clock) I think he got lucky, and it’s likely a sprain especially since he threw a dime 2 plays later to Mack Hollins,” Dr. Jesse Morse wrote on X. “Is he sore? Yes Did he significantly dislocate his shoulder? No, unlikely This isn’t the mechanism for an AC sprain.” While that assessment suggests Maye avoided serious structural damage, his performance afterward raised fresh concerns. He completed just 10 passes for 86 yards, his lowest output of the season. The Patriots still advanced, but the drop in efficiency was impossible to ignore. Former NFL team physician Dr. David Chao offered a more cautious perspective, comparing Maye’s situation to the opposing quarterback’s health. “I am far more concerned about Drake May’s right shoulder than Sam Darnold’s oblique heading into the Super Bowl. I’m not saying Drake May won’t play, and I’m not saying this is a season-ending issue,” Dr. Davis Chao said. “I’m saying that, as of Monday — nearly two weeks before the Super Bowl — the concern level is much higher for Drake May’s throwing shoulder than it is for Sam Darnold’s oblique.” For now, the Patriots are buying time with rest and limited disclosure. Whether that shoulder responds remains the defining question heading into football’s biggest stage.

During the Broncos' AFC Championship Game appearance, Nix cheered his team on from an Empower Field at Mile High suite — and Head Coach Sean Payton knows how difficult that must have been for Denver's quarterback.

""I'm sure there's disappointment for him to have to watch,"" Payton said Tuesday. ""… I think it's difficult. … I think it's difficult to get as far as he brought us — and then maybe to see also one of his contemporaries [in Drake Maye], someone in his draft class, that he would've loved to [have] competed against [to] advance. It can be a tough game.""

But as Nix recovers from surgery on his ankle — an injury Payton said doctors determined ""was coming sooner than later"" — and looks toward a return, his teammates believe the untimely end to his season could end up spurring him to future success.

""I can only imagine what this is going to do to fuel him,"" inside linebacker Alex Singleton said Monday.

Payton often mentions that confidence develops from demonstrated ability, and it's clear the Broncos' belief in their quarterback stems from the success he's helped Denver achieve in his first two seasons.

In 2025, the Broncos tied a franchise record for regular-season wins, earned their first division title in a decade and captured the No. 1 seed in the AFC. Nix led all NFL quarterbacks in game-winning drives in 2025, and he also posted six fourth-quarter comebacks including the postseason.

In a Divisional Round duel against the Bills' top-ranked passing defense, Nix threw for three touchdowns and delivered a go-ahead strike to Marvin Mims Jr. in the final minutes of regulation.

Time and time again, Nix has delivered. His teammates have certainly noticed — even if they can't always believe it.

""He's special,"" safety Talanoa Hufanga said Monday. ""There's a reason why I wore a shirt with him on it. I want him to feel the confidence that I have in him. [He's] a dude that just goes out there and, regardless of the situation — you guys all saw it all year — it's these fourth quarters and this dude pulls this game out, and you're just like, 'How does he do it?'""

Through Nix's first two seasons, there are a slew of impressive stats at which to point. He joined Peyton Manning and Justin Herbert as the only players in NFL history with at least 3,500 passing yards and 25 passing touchdowns in each of their first two seasons. He's only the third Broncos quarterback in franchise history with three passing touchdowns in a playoff game. Only Dan Marino and Patrick Mahomes have more games with four-plus passing touchdowns over their first two seasons.

And yet, the most impressive stats have to do with winning football games.

""I just think you evaluate a quarterback by how much he wins,"" General Manager George Paton said Tuesday. ""And there's been no quarterback in his first two years who's won more than Bo. We can just start there.""

Nix's 24 regular-season wins are tied for the most in NFL history in a player's first two seasons, and he posted more wins in 2025 than any quarterback has in a single season in franchise history.

Those numbers stem from Nix's late-game heroics, which Paton said could be counted on but cannot necessarily be taught.

""It got to the point where we're behind and Bo had the ball, and we're like, 'OK, we're going to win this,'"" Paton said. ""You can look at all the traits for quarterbacks: their arm strength, their accuracy, all that. … He has that 'It' factor. I don't think you can teach that. Either you have it, or you don't — and he has it. So, wow. [After] two years, we have a quarterback that can win, win at a high level. He's best in the big moments. We've seen that. Does he have areas to improve? Yes, like all quarterbacks. But if you have a quarterback that has that 'It' factor that's best in the big moments, that's pretty big.""

As Nix rehabs from his injury and looks to return for Year 3, those around him know they have the right player at the game's most important position.

""That's the guy you want at the helm,"" Singleton said. ""There's teams around the league that are fighting to find a guy to play that position, and we've found one. That's the biggest thing, is having a guy who can do that week in and week out, and he's shown that he's able to do that.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/broncos/ydsymvb5buc4mk9jjaki,N,,2026-01-27 19:01:51.703447

From a personal perspective, a reporter asked, does he want Aaron Rodgers back as his quarterback?
The ability to develop quarterbacks was a key trait Steelers' brass wanted in their next head coach.
McCarthy, who is just the fourth Steelers' head coach since 1969 and the only one in that span from an offensive background, said he will call the plays with his new team.
""We came into this wanting to hire the best coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers,"" Rooney said.","PITTSBURGH -- Less than 10 minutes into the Mike McCarthy era of the Pittsburgh Steelers, the franchise's new head coach had to address the elephant in the room.

From a personal perspective, a reporter asked, does he want Aaron Rodgers back as his quarterback?

""That's nice the way he asked that,"" a chuckling McCarthy said to the question. ""I mean definitely. I don't see why you wouldn't. ... I have spoken to Aaron, and so that's really where we are there, but I was able to sit back and watch the games and watch most of the Pittsburgh games on TV and I thought he was a great asset for the team.""

The 62-year-old coach acknowledged that Rodgers, like other veteran players, needed time to decompress and make a decision on his future, but the coach embraced the idea of reuniting with the quarterback with whom he spent 13 seasons in Green Bay and won a Super Bowl title.

""I think that's very important,"" McCarthy said of players like Rodgers taking a break. ""The game is so emotional, what these men commit to, and what they put into it. I think that time away is important.""

Speaking at his introductory news conference Tuesday, McCarthy said he and general manager Omar Khan haven't discussed a timeline or a deadline for Rodgers' decision as they ramp up NFL draft preparation. The position appears similar to a year ago when Rodgers weighed his options until signing a one-year contract in June.

Facing uncertainty at the quarterback position entering the 2025 NFL draft, the Steelers opted to wait until the sixth round before selecting Ohio State quarterback Will Howard. The rookie spent most of the season on injured reserve after sustaining a broken finger in his throwing hand during what started as a promising training camp.

McCarthy said Tuesday he was impressed with Howard, who helped the Buckeyes to a national championship.

""I'm really excited about Will Howard,"" McCarthy said. ""He's someone that I thought really came on there at Ohio State. I'm anxious to work with him. It'd be great to have Aaron back. But Will and Mason [Rudolph], I'm really, really excited to get started with those guys.""

Before getting his first offensive coordinator job in New Orleans in 2000, McCarthy, a Pittsburgh native, got his start working with quarterbacks, something he picked up as a graduate assistant under the guidance of Paul Hackett, then the head coach at Pitt. Since then, McCarthy has helped with the development of quarterbacks including Rodgers and Dak Prescott.

""The quarterback position, to me, is a huge challenge because you don't have the individual time that the other positions have,"" McCarthy said about his process. ""But really finding time, being efficient with your workload capacity and making sure those guys get the fundamental training. So just never really deviating from the old school way that has worked for decades.""

The ability to develop quarterbacks was a key trait Steelers' brass wanted in their next head coach.

""With everybody we talked to, the conversation of developing the next quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers was part of it,"" Khan said. ""I think Mike's resume speaks for itself, who he's been around, but we're excited about working with Will, and that was a part of it.""

McCarthy, who is just the fourth Steelers' head coach since 1969 and the only one in that span from an offensive background, said he will call the plays with his new team. And he said the past 48 hours have been ""fluid"" as he builds his coaching staff.

Though the Steelers' past three head coaches were all young, defensive assistants without head coach experience, Art Rooney II said he wasn't necessarily searching for someone in that mold this time around. The team also brought in defensive coordinators Brian Flores and Anthony Weaver for in-person interviews before landing on McCarthy, reaching a verbal agreement with the coach on Saturday.

""We came into this wanting to hire the best coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers,"" Rooney said. ""So, we did not say we're trying to hire a young defensive coordinator or offensive guy. We had an open mind about it, I think, just wanted to make sure we found the best coach, and we were able to interview some great coaches.

""I won't say it was an easy decision, but I would say at the end of the day, it was an obvious decision for us that Mike was the guy for the job.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0127%2Fr1606454_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 18:02:40.750428

Nix sustained the injury during one of the final plays in the win over the Bills that sent the Broncos to the AFC championship game.

Shortly after the game, Payton told reporters about Nix's injury and that the quarterback would miss the rest of the season.

Nix is expected to be out at least 12 weeks after undergoing surgery. He reportedly will not be allowed to put any weight on his ankle for a month. If he recovers well, the earliest he can begin activity would be right around the 12-week mark.

The Broncos expect Nix to be recovered enough in time for offseason workouts.

“So listen, he’ll rehab his tail off and get ready and get back to being healthy,” Payton said. “I think for someone who runs with the ball, I think he’s done a pretty good job of protecting himself, not all the time, but for the most part, he’s done a pretty good job of sliding and understanding playing for another day.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eTXnpVXj55bfc6pyJOxLFQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2026-01/edb39a40-fa00-11f0-abfe-325a838ae772,N,,2026-01-27 22:01:48.870240

Just before going to the lectern for his wrap-up news conference, Payton said he saw Nix cruising around team headquarters on his medical scooter, which he'll use until he graduates to crutches and then a walking boot.

""He was just up above us here,"" Payton said from the atrium of the Broncos' suburban headquarters. ""I said, 'What are you doing? Getting your scooter laps in?'

""You have to know him. He's fidgety to begin with,"" Payton said. ""He might have just been getting his scooter laps. He was up there, like, in an area he'd never be in departmentwise. He's handling it like a pro. Man, I'm sure there's disappointment for him to have to watch"" on Sunday.

Nix led the Broncos (15-4) to a franchise record-tying 14 wins in the regular season and their first playoff triumph since Super Bowl 50 a decade ago. He has won 25 games in two seasons and has an NFL-best 11 game-winning drives in the fourth quarter or overtime during that span.

We’re talking about injury timeouts, those crucial pauses when a player goes down and the clock grinds to a standstill. But what exactly governs these moments, and how do they fit into the broader picture of NFL rules and player conduct?

When you watch an NFL game, you see incredible athleticism, split-second decisions, and, yes, sometimes, players getting hurt. The league has a vested interest in player safety, and that's where the rules around injuries come into play. While the term ""injury timeout"" might sound straightforward, it’s part of a larger framework designed to ensure fair play and protect the athletes. Unlike a coach-called timeout to strategize, an injury timeout is typically initiated by officials when a player is visibly injured and unable to continue without attention. The game clock stops, and medical personnel can enter the field to assess the situation. This isn't just about stopping the game; it's about ensuring the player receives prompt care and that the game can resume safely once the situation is managed.

But the NFL's commitment to its players and the integrity of the game extends far beyond just stopping play for injuries. The league, in conjunction with the NFL Players Association (NFLPA), has a robust system in place for player conduct and accountability. You might have seen headlines about fines or suspensions, and it’s worth understanding the philosophy behind them. It’s not about stifling the passion or taking the fun out of the game; it’s about maintaining a standard of behavior that respects the sport, the opponents, the officials, and the millions of fans watching.

Think of it as a shared responsibility. Before each season kicks off, players are given a detailed breakdown of the rules, including what constitutes unsportsmanlike conduct, dangerous plays, or actions detrimental to the league. They even sign forms acknowledging they understand these expectations and the potential consequences. This isn't a surprise tactic; it's about clear communication and setting expectations. The fines collected, interestingly, don't go into the NFL's coffers. Instead, they are directed towards programs that support former players and promote health, safety, and wellness across all levels of football, from youth leagues to the pros.

Compliance officers within NFL Football Operations play a key role here. They're tasked with ensuring that players conduct themselves in a way that honors the game. This means everything from avoiding unnecessary roughness – like those dangerous hits that could endanger a fellow player – to maintaining composure and sportsmanship. Fighting, taunting, and even inappropriate contact with officials are strictly prohibited and come with penalties. The league emphasizes consistency and fairness, applying these rules across all 32 teams.

It’s a complex ecosystem, isn't it? On one hand, you have the immediate, critical need to stop play for an injured player. On the other, you have a comprehensive code of conduct designed to uphold the spirit and safety of the game. Both are essential components of what makes the NFL the spectacle it is, ensuring that while the competition is fierce, it's also conducted with a fundamental respect for the game and everyone involved.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-27 16:01:24.143217

Two weeks -- a chance to go win the Super Bowl.
The Patriots will release an injury report on Wednesday and what it says about Maye will be a main topic of conversation throughout Super Bowl week.
The Seahawks are currently 4.5-point favorites in the Super Bowl.","The New England Patriots are heading to their 10th Super Bowl this century after defeating the Broncos 10-7 in a snowy, defense-heavy game in Denver. Patriots Nation went from celebrating a historically quick rebuild to worrying about the status of their starting quarterback as the team heads into Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks.

A social media account called ""Pro Football Doc,"" run by David J. Chao, who provides insight on many injuries after serving a an NFL team doctor for 17-plus years, made a claim that quarterback Drake Maye injured his shoulder in the AFC Championship Game.

""There is no question in my mind that Drake Maye injured his right throwing shoulder against the Denver Broncos,"" Chao said. ""Of course, how bad is the injury remains to be seen. What type of injury -- I'm still gathering data, but let me give you the evidence.""

Coach Mike Vrabel was asked about his quarterback's status during his appearance on WEEI on Tuesday.

""There's not a player on our team that's 100% healthy,"" Vrabel said. ""I would imagine we'll go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we'll turn it in. But nobody's 100%. This will be our 21st game.""

During his media availability shortly after his radio spot, Vrabel said the situation was ""probably"" blown out of proportion.

""I wouldn't say anybody hurt anything,"" Vrabel said, when asked if Maye hurt his shoulder. ""This is a sport where there's gonna be things that come up. We'll talk about whatever status each player has for the game once we're required to. We understand that. We were able to function offensively, throw the football, run the football so that's kinda where everybody's at.""

Maye was sacked five times and took numerous other hits, including one that some are pointing as the cause of the apparent injury. In the third quarter, Maye slid at the end of a 13-yard run and was tackled by Broncos safety Talanoa Hufanga. Maye landed on his throwing shoulder and at the end of the play was seen holding that shoulder.

After Sunday's win, Maye admitted that he was dealing with ""bumps and bruises.""

""I think a lot of those guys in that locker room are battling through things,"" Maye said. ""At the same time, the best thing about it is we have another chance at it. Another chance at it to get healthy. Two weeks -- a chance to go win the Super Bowl. That's what it is, and that's pretty cool.""

Some have theorized that the Patriots were more conservative on offense because he injured his shoulder. Others point out that the lack of a pass game was due to inclement weather, wanting to eat up more of the clock and the confidence in their defense against a Broncos offense that wasn't productive for most of the game.

Just two plays after the alleged injury occurred, Maye completed a 31-yard pass to Mack Hollins, a play that is also being used by some to say Maye's throwing shoulder is fine.

To seal the win, Maye called his own number, running on a naked bootleg rather than the seemingly original plan to hand the ball to running back Rhamondre Stevenson. The second-year QB's risk paid off when he gained seven yards on third-and-5, with a slight stiff arm using his throwing hand.

The Patriots will release an injury report on Wednesday and what it says about Maye will be a main topic of conversation throughout Super Bowl week.

The 21-year-old sustained the injury while chasing a long ball in the second half of United’s 3-2 win at league leaders Arsenal on Sunday, in which he scored a half-volley from just outside the box.

United are still assessing the extent of the injury, with a timeline still not totally certain.

The injury is a significant blow to United. After primarily being used as a wing-back under former head coach Ruben Amorim, Dorgu has been deployed as a left winger in a 4-2-3-1 by interim head coach Michael Carrick. He started and scored in the wins over Manchester City and Arsenal.

Ten weeks out would see Dorgu miss the club’s next eight matches and put him in line for a return after March’s international break, with United taking on Leeds United on April 11.

Carrick said in his press conference after the Arsenal game that he hoped that the injury was not too serious and Dorgu had “hopefully” come off with cramp .

He joins centre-back Matthijs de Ligt on the sidelines, who has missed the last 11 games with a back issue sustained in early December.

Dorgu has featured 22 times in the Premier League this season, recording three goals and three assists.

The Denmark international signed for United on February 2 last year, joining from Serie A club Lecce for £25million ($33.7m) and has made 44 appearances for the side to date.

‘A cruel blow’

Analysis from Manchester United correspondent Mark Critchley

Dorgu’s injury is a cruel blow to both United and the player himself, arriving on the back of his best week since arriving at Old Trafford a year ago.

Sunday’s spectacular strike at the Emirates followed another goal in the Manchester derby the previous weekend.

Add those to Boxing Day’s goal of the month contender against Newcastle United, Dorgu had scored three times in his five recent appearances when deployed further forward rather than as a left wing-back.

That new, more advanced role had reinvigorated a player who had struggled for form and consistency since joining in a €30m move from Lecce, so much so that former head coach Ruben Amorim said he could feel Dorgu’s “anxiety” from the touchline. The Denmark international has looked anything but anxious of late.

Matheus Cunha is an obvious replacement on the left wing and will surely be restored to the starting line-up by Michael Carrick in Dorgu’s absence, but given how well Dorgu has been playing recently, that absence will still be felt.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/27043338/GettyImages-2258250203.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-27 15:01:59.520848

In the playoffs, Maye has not been as effective through the air, completing 55.8% of his passes for 533 yards with four touchdowns and two interceptions while getting sacked 15 times.

DiNucci was working for CBS Sports as a commentator when the team lost starting quarterback Bo Nix to a season-ending ankle injury. One day after he broke down the Nix news on television, DiNucci received a call from the Broncos with an offer to join their practice squad.

Denver had familiarity with DiNucci from his time with the club in 2023, and he returned to the team last week to serve as QB3 behind fill-in starter Jarrett Stidham and promoted QB2 Sam Ehlinger. Unfortunately, the Broncos were not able to advance to the Super Bowl without Nix, falling to the New England Patriots 10-7 in the AFC title game.

Following that loss, Denver has started signing practice squad players to reserve/future contracts. DiNucci hasn't received a reserve/future deal, so it looks like his second stint with the team will be short-lived. He shared this message to Broncos Country following Sunday's loss:

If he does not receive a reserve/future contract from Denver in the coming days, DiNucci's practice squad contract will expire on Monday and he will become a free agent.

By Hunt Palmer

Garrett Nussmeier‘s senior season was grounded before it started.

The nagging August abdominal issue continued through September and into October before it finally cost him the final month of the season. This week at The Senior Bowl in Mobile, Nussmeier is looking to show NFL organizations that he’s recovered and back to the passer who topped 4,000 yards in 2024.

“I feel good. It’s been a long process trying to get healthy,” Nussmeier said. “We were really able to get some answers. Probably about a month ago was the first time we were able to figure out what it was. Finally got a good plan to try and get healthy, so it was a gametime decision to see if I would be able to come out here.”

So, what was the issue?

“I couldn’t use my core,” Nussmeier said. “So, I was throwing the ball without a core. I’ve been having to go back from the ground up and retrain myself and get back to finishing throws and rotating through the ball. I’m actually using my core now. It’s been nice. The ball is definitely coming out a lot different.”

Nussmeier finished his final collegiate season completing 67.4 percent of his throws for 1927 yards and 12 touchdowns. His yards per game average slipped from 311.7 to 214.1. He just wasn’t the same player.

Though he insists he’s not out to “prove anything”, The Senior Bowl offers a great opportunity for him to prove himself in the meeting rooms and on the practice field where some of the best prospects in the spring’s draft will be competing.

“When I was able to say, hey, I can go, full go, it’s a great opportunity for me,” Nussmeier said. “One, I grew up watching the Senior Bowl. My dad played in the Senior Bowl 30 years ago or something like that, back in the dinosaur age. To get that opportunity is really cool.”

THE DAILY BLOVIATION

Like many who follow the Cleveland Browns, I am struggling with the team's approach to the coaching search. Hell, I was on ""Team Keep-the-Coach"" in the first place, so if I had my druthers (whatever those are), we wouldn't even be in this place.

At this point, we don't know what course the Browns will take to finalize their coaching search. Supposedly, they're all heading back from Los Angeles to Cleveland today and will discuss things in Berea as a group. One doesn't even know the basic parameters of what they'll be discussing - Do they feel Sheelhaase is no longer in the running? How did the interview go? What do they know of Buffalo's interest in the coach?

And so forth.

Unfortunately, I can't opine with any degree of certainty about what will transpire today or in the succeeding days.

If I were the Cleveland Browns, I know what I would do, and it has little to do with probable results on the football field, which no one can predict anyway. It would have everything to do with the business I'm in.

As a fellow business owner and someone who has been tracking fans' involvement with the team over the years, I don't think the Browns are in the position of selling their football product, which has been atrocious for years. The Browns brand should be selling competence, professionalism, and fun. But 20 years of futility have ruined that, and they have precious little left to sell a skeptical fan base.

What the Browns should be selling is hope.

The remaining devoted fans of the Cleveland Browns still have some hope. It may be faint, but it's there. Otherwise, they would have given up long ago. They're looking for something, anything to cling to with respect to the team's future.

The Browns, if there are options for them, should be looking at what will inspire hope. Again, if the option is there, that's why they should choose Nate Sheelhaase as the next head coach of the Cleveland Browns.

If the team goes in another direction, they'll be required to ""sell"" Browns fans on their decision. Jim Schwartz, for example, is a great defensive coach, but he's not had a track record of success as a head coach. He's older, and like most older people, myself included, we sort of know what we're going to get and, historically, that's been limited. I think a fraction of the Browns' fan base could be won over to the selection, but it's going to take some selling to some skeptical fans.

With Scheelhaase, the Browns would be bringing in a young coach with a strong early track record, little experience, but an unknown ceiling. Browns fans would be able to get behind his potential as a selection and have some optimism. I don't see that optimism coming along with a hire like Schwartz, Monken, or Lynn.

As Jimmy Haslam and crew make their decision, they need to understand their track record, the mood of the fan base, and what product it is that they're selling. And right now, hope is their only product.

Have a good one! GO BROWNS!

Positive news from the world of sports and beyond...

Yes, one image from space can change humanity's perspective - (bigthink.com)

Longtime readers of this Massie Morning Missive will remember that I was incredibly overexcited about the total solar eclipse several years ago. That event, for me, was a very big deal, and cemented for me my place in the universe. Namely, relatively insignificant, but at least having a good time. Events like the eclipse or photos from space are tremendous reminders of our connectedness to the universe and resonate with the spirit. This article goes into that, if you are interested.

The days of a head coach running things, are numbered for the few who can still hold the power like Andy Reid, and over for those without the cache.

Front offices are in charge, and coaches are just cogs in the wheel of a giant corporate machine. Consider most ""Managers"" in MLB, don't really set their own lineups, or make their pitching change decisions. It all comes from the front office with huge input from the analytics department. AI is analytics on steroids. Play design, counters, tendency breakers, may all come on Kurt Cignetti's 9-5 schedule soon for coaches, because computers will do the work. Coaches become about execution, and player management. I mean even now while they retain the authority mostly, some guy in their ear tells them when to go or kick on 4th down. Those little Microsoft tablets are going to be used for a whole lot more in the future.

https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/47730797/how-premier-league-clubs-turned-corporations-replaced-managers-head-coaches

Thus, I expect the half-life of an NFL coach has just gotten shorter, and will continue until we see things like we do in world soccer. If a manager makes it more than a year, its pretty extraordinary. Harbaugh may well be the last coach hired who gets big money, 5 years, and control. Why would you pay that for someone who won't really be in charge?

Ex-NFL team doctor that he believes Maye hurt his shoulder during the 10-7 win against the Denver Broncos. Chao has built a reputation for analyzing injuries on his social media accounts and has a track record of accuracy.

Dr. Chao noted he believed Maye hurt his shoulder on a run in the third quarter, when he landed on his elbow. Chao noted Maye was working out his shoulder after his next pass. On Tuesday, Chao provided an update on what he thinks of the Patriots quarterback’s shoulder injury.

“Nothing inflammatory here, just stating my opinion (and found more evidence that I will show when I can),” Dr. Chao wrote on X. “The right shoulder injury seems real. The possibility of missing (Super Bowl LX) does not.”

Mike Vrabel was asked on “The Greg Hill Show” about the rumors and gave a vague answer.

“There’s not a player on our team that’s 100-percent healthy,” Vrabel said on Tuesday.

When asked if Drake Maye is healthy enough to play at a high level, he kept things vague.

“I would imagine we’ll go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we’ll turn it in,” Vrabel said. “But nobody’s 100 percent. (It’ll) be our 21st game.”

“I think that everybody, including Drake, is not 100% at this part of the year. We’ll do everything that we can to help our players be prepared and get ready for this game,” Vrabel said.

When asked in a follow-up whether or not Maye did hurt his shoulder, the Patriots’ first-year head coach claimed that he “wouldn’t say that anybody hurt anything.”

“Again, this is a sport where there’s going to be things that come up, but I don’t think that there’s a — we’ll talk about whatever status each player has for the game once we’re required to. We understand that. But we were able to function offensively, throw the football, run the football. So, that’s kind of where everybody’s at.”

Original story 1/27/2026: Mike Vrabel sidesteps Drake Maye injury questions ahead of Super Bowl

At first glance, the New England Patriots appeared to have escaped the AFC Championship Game against the Denver Broncos without any major injury issues. However, on Monday, speculation started to make the rounds online about quarterback Drake Maye potentially having injured his right throwing shoulder on a scramble play in the third quarter.

Advertisement

Maye himself did not show any limitations after the play, but did acknowledge some “bumps and bruises” during his press conference after the 10-7 victory spoke. Are they a valid reason for concern, though? That remains to be seen, especially with Mike Vrabel opting not to directly address the rumors on Monday morning.

Appearing on WEEI’s The Greg Hill Show, the Patriots’ head coach channeled his inner Bill Belichick when asked about Maye’s supposed shoulder ailment:

Q: Is he a 100% healthy today as you guys get ready?

Vrabel: There’s not a player on our team that’s 100% healthy.

Q: Is he healthy enough to play at a high level?

Vrabel: I would imagine we will go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we’ll turn it in. But nobody is 100%. This will be our 21st game.

Maye finished the game without missing any time, and did not look particularly bothered by his shoulder or any other injuries during and after the contest. He completed his longest pass of the day, a 31-yarder to Mack Hollins, two plays after the scramble in question and was quick to pop up again following a sack in the fourth quarter that saw him land on that very same right shoulder.

As Vrabel noted, though, his team will share all the necessary information as part of its injury report. The first of those leading up to Super Bowl LX against the Seattle Seahawks will be released next Wednesday.

It all started late Monday when Dr. David J. Chao, a former Los Angeles Chargers team doctor who has since transitioned to a controversial sports media career, claimed Maye injured his right shoulder during the AFC Championship Game win over the Denver Broncos.

“Drake Maye injured his right throwing shoulder against the Broncos,” Chao wrote on X with an accompanying video that did little to substantiate his claim. “How severe the injury is, and the exact diagnosis, remains to be determined. Heading into Super Bowl LX, I’m far more concerned about Maye’s shoulder than Sam Darnold’s oblique.

At that point, it was easy to write off Chao’s claim as nonsense. And perhaps it still is, but subsequent reporting, plus comments from Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel, have fueled concerns about Maye’s health.

First, at 8:24 p.m. ET on Monday, Greg Bedard of the Boston Sports Journal provided a sourced update on Maye.

“The information that I have at this moment is that any Maye ‘injury’ to his throwing shoulder is not believed to be an issue,” Bedard wrote on X.

Obviously, that’s different than saying Maye doesn’t have an injured throwing shoulder.

Roughly 30 minutes later, ESPN’s Mike Reiss, one of the most well-connected reporters covering the Patriots, wrote these three interesting paragraphs:

“Maye’s physical condition also could be a factor. As part of his regular routine, Maye planned for time with team physical therapist/athletic trainer Zach Gerber, whom the signal-caller has credited for helping him endure through the physical grind of the season. Maye was sacked five times on Sunday and took other hits. One noteworthy hit came at the end of a 13-yard run late in the third quarter; on the play, Maye slid somewhat awkwardly and was tackled by safety Talanoa Hufanga, with Maye landing on his throwing shoulder.

“Asked by ESPN to describe how he felt physically after the conference championship game, Maye acknowledged ‘some bumps and bruises’ before adding, ‘But hey, that’s what it takes.’

” ‘I think a lot of those guys in that locker room are battling through things,’ he said. ‘At the same time, the best thing about it is we have another chance at it. Another chance at it to get healthy. Two weeks — a chance to go win the Super Bowl. That’s what it is, and that’s pretty cool.’ “

Again, that sure sounds like Maye is dealing with some sort of shoulder injury, albeit potentially minor.

That brings us to Tuesday morning, when Vrabel, appearing on WEEI’s “The Greg Hill Show“, was asked about the injury rumors and whether Maye is 100% healthy ahead of the Super Bowl.

“There’s not a player on our team that’s 100% healthy,” Vrabel said.

Vrabel then was asked whether Maye is healthy enough to play at a high level.

“I would imagine we will go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we’ll turn it in,” Vrabel said. “But nobody is 100%. This will be our 21st game.”

You can draw your own conclusions, but the tea leaves point in an obvious direction. Again, there’s no reason to question Maye’s availability for Super Bowl LX, but there’s at least some reason to believe his shoulder is bothering him.

All eyes will be on Thursday’s practice and ensuing injury report, which will offer more clarity on Maye’s condition.

Obviously, that’s different than saying Maye doesn’t have an injured throwing shoulder.

Roughly 30 minutes later, ESPN’s Mike Reiss, one of the most well-connected reporters covering the Patriots, wrote these three interesting paragraphs:

“Maye’s physical condition also could be a factor. As part of his regular routine, Maye planned for time with team physical therapist/athletic trainer Zach Gerber, whom the signal-caller has credited for helping him endure through the physical grind of the season. Maye was sacked five times on Sunday and took other hits. One noteworthy hit came at the end of a 13-yard run late in the third quarter; on the play, Maye slid somewhat awkwardly and was tackled by safety Talanoa Hufanga, with Maye landing on his throwing shoulder.

“Asked by ESPN to describe how he felt physically after the conference championship game, Maye acknowledged ‘some bumps and bruises’ before adding, ‘But hey, that’s what it takes.’

” ‘I think a lot of those guys in that locker room are battling through things,’ he said. ‘At the same time, the best thing about it is we have another chance at it. Another chance at it to get healthy. Two weeks — a chance to go win the Super Bowl. That’s what it is, and that’s pretty cool.’ “

Again, that sure sounds like Maye is dealing with some sort of shoulder injury, albeit potentially minor.

That brings us to Tuesday morning, when Vrabel, appearing on WEEI’s “The Greg Hill Show“, was asked about the injury rumors and whether Maye is 100% healthy ahead of the Super Bowl.

“There’s not a player on our team that’s 100% healthy,” Vrabel said.

Vrabel then was asked whether Maye is healthy enough to play at a high level.

“I would imagine we will go through the injury report, and whenever we have to turn that in, we’ll turn it in,” Vrabel said. “But nobody is 100%. This will be our 21st game.”

You can draw your own conclusions, but the tea leaves point in an obvious direction. Again, there’s no reason to question Maye’s availability for Super Bowl LX, but there’s at least some reason to believe his shoulder is bothering him.

All eyes will be on Thursday’s practice and ensuing injury report, which will offer more clarity on Maye’s condition.",https://s47719.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2026/01/Drake-Maye-7-e1768161240731.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:05:34.988327

Saints safeties Justin Reid and Jonas Sanker emerged as a cornerstone of the defense, holding down the defensive backfield for majority of the season. Reid started 15 games, missing two to a knee injury, while the rookie Sanker played in all 17 — taking over as the starter in Week 2 following an injury to Julian Blackmon.

Reid signed with the Saints in free agency and made an immediate impact as a veteran voice in the locker room and earning a selection as a team captain in his first season back in his home state. Reid accumulated 72 tackles (37 solo) including two tackles for loss and a half sack, six pass deflections and an interception returned 49 yards for a touchdown.

Initially anticipated as a core special teams player by the coaching staff heading into the season, Sanker took on a prominent role following Blackmon's injury. The third-round pick made the most of his opportunity recording 80 tackles (46 solo) including three tackles for loss, six pass deflections, two interceptions returned for 29 yards and a fumble recovery returned for 27 yards.

Justin Reid on Jonas Sanker stepping into a starting role following Julian Blackmon's injury:

His story follows my story. My rookie year I started the second game of the season for the same reason — that there was an injury that came up in the first game and I started the second game — so I already talked to Jonas a little bit about that. And he'll be ready for the moment. He shined in preseason, he was flying around all over the ball and we just need that same player to play on Sunday. And his best will be good enough for us.

The two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are traditionally filled with speculation, rumors and storylines that very well may turn out to be inconsequential for the outcome of the game.
Drake Maye’s supposed shoulder injury is a candidate to fall into all those categories as well.
But a chance to go win the Super Bowl.","The New England Patriots’ 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship may not have been the prettiest game of the NFL season, but it doesn’t matter. A win is a win, and this particular one allows the Patriots to return to the Super Bowl after a six-year absence.

The victory is not the only thing the team can feel good about coming out of Sunday. The Patriots also seem to have avoided any substantial injuries along the way — or have they? After all, there has been some online speculation following the game that starting quarterback Drake Maye may have sustained a right shoulder injury.

LB Robert Spillane: The Patriots’ defensive signal caller remained on the ground after making a tackle on a short run with 3:37 left in the first quarter, and slammed his helmet in frustration afterwards. He eventually walked off the field under his own power, but went straight into the blue medical tent for further evaluation. Spillane eventually departed for the locker room and was announced as questionable to return to the contest because of an ankle injury. However, he reemerged in the second period and tried out his ankle on the sideline. Ultimately, though, he never reentered the game.

QB Drake Maye: New England’s starting quarterback found himself under substantial pressure against the Broncos’ top-tier pass rush, and ended up absorbing five sacks, seven hits, and four tackles on rushing attempts. On one of those, the supposed shoulder injury happened: with 3:46 to go in the third quarter, Maye scrambled up the middle and was taken down by safety Talanoa Hufanga. He landed on his right throwing shoulder, and his hand indeed went up to it immediately; he very well could have just been adjusting his shoulder pads, though, because he also did the same on the left afterwards. All of that is speculation, of course. What we do know is that Maye stayed in the game and did not show any unexpected signs of discomfort despite taking another hit and tackle later in the game. He also completed a 31-yards pass just two plays after the play in question.

The two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are traditionally filled with speculation, rumors and storylines that very well may turn out to be inconsequential for the outcome of the game. Drake Maye’s supposed shoulder injury is a candidate to fall into all those categories as well.

“Got some bumps and bruises, but, hey, that’s what it takes,” he said. “I think a lot of those guys in that locker room are battling through things, and I think at the same time the best thing about it is we get another chance at it. Another chance to get healthy — two weeks and we’ll go into some nicer weather, knock on some wood. We’ll see. But a chance to go win the Super Bowl. I mean that’s what it is. That’s pretty cool.”

The team captain previously missed four games because of an ankle injury, meaning that his situation is one worth monitoring coming out of the AFC title game. However, the fact that he was allowed to return to the sideline and possible return to the game if the situation had called for it can be interpreted as a positive sign.

Ultimately, however, we will have to wait for more information to come out. Some might come on Tuesday via head coach Mike Vrabel; some might come on Thursday when the team returns to practice.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2026/01/gettyimages-2257692223.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C1.1254733359913%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2026-01-27 14:01:37.779966

Pro football doctor David Chao, who gives his opinions on NFL injuries on social media, mentioned the potential injury following the Patriots' AFC Championship win over the Denver Broncos. It initially came as a surprise considering Maye finished the game and even completed some passes in the immediate aftermath.

However, Vrabel didn't completely shut it down when asked about it on The Greg Hill Show on Tuesday morning.

It's important to note that Chao doesn't expect the injury to keep Maye from playing in Super Bowl LX.

""I know Patriots fans want to hear it but take a watch/listen and judge for yourself. Nothing inflammatory here, just stating my opinion (and found more evidence that I will show when I can).

Maye finished it out and didn’t appear limited, but he did mention “bumps and bruises” afterward in the 10-7 win. No one’s sure yet if that’s typical postgame soreness or something more.

Head coach Mike Vrabel didn’t help clear things up when he joined The Greg Hill Show. He sidestepped the injury talk entirely.

Maye played every snap and looked fine as the game went on. He threw his deepest ball of the afternoon just two plays after the scramble everyone’s talking about, a 31-yard completion to Mack Hollins.

He also took a fourth-quarter sack and landed hard on that same shoulder but got up without hesitation.

Despite the lack of depth, it remains unlikely that Liverpool will enter the market for senior defensive help this month.","Liverpool’s defensive resources have been further depleted after youngster Wellity Lucky was ruled out for at least two months with a hamstring injury.

The 20-year-old centre-back is a member of Liverpool’s under-21 squad but has frequently trained with the first team this season, and has been on the bench in the Premier League five times. He made his senior debut in the 3-0 Carabao Cup defeat to Crystal Palace in October.

While he is not considered a Premier League starting option, his injury — which has forced him to miss the under-21s’ last two matches against Arsenal and Leeds United — means head coach Arne Slot has one fewer defensive option for his substitutes’ bench.

Summer signing Giovanni Leoni has been out injured since September after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury, a blow that left Liverpool with three senior options.

Joe Gomez came off injured after colliding with goalkeeper Alisson in the defeat to AFC Bournemouth on Saturday night. It is not expected to be serious but the length of his absence remains unknown.

Ibrahima Konate, who has been first choice alongside Virgil van Dijk this season, remains on compassionate leave after the death of his father.

Central midfielder Wataru Endo was brought on by Slot in place of Gomez against Bournemouth. Fellow midfielder Ryan Gravenberch is another option Slot could use in that position having switched him there during matches.

Liverpool are short on defensive options across the pitch, with right-back Conor Bradley also suffering a season-ending injury against Arsenal earlier this month. Tottenham Hotspur held talks with the Anfield club over a move for veteran left-back Andrew Robertson but Liverpool are currently not willing to sanction that deal, partly due to difficulties in recalling Kostas Tsimikas from AS Roma.

Despite the lack of depth, it remains unlikely that Liverpool will enter the market for senior defensive help this month.

Estimated Reading Time: 13 minutes

The 2025 NFL season is nearly complete, which means we can begin to assess the state of each team’s roster for next year. We’ll attempt to find one breakout player for each team ahead of the 2026 campaign.

Arizona Cardinals: DI Walter Nolen

The Cardinals' first-round pick was limited to just six appearances and 169 defensive snaps in his rookie season, but he produced an excellent 80.1 PFF pass-rush grade across that small sample. Had he played enough snaps to qualify, Nolen would have recorded the 13th-best pass-rush win rate (13.0%) among defensive tackles. The Cardinals will surely be hoping that he can fully recover from his season-ending knee injury and replicate that production.

Atlanta Falcons: EDGE Jalon Walker

Walker battled through some minor injuries to produce a 71.6 PFF overall grade as a rookie. He racked up 29 pressures, including six sacks. Perhaps the more surprising part is that his 81.3 PFF run-defense grade ranked sixth among qualified edge defenders. Walker was supposed to go through a longer transition period in the run game as he made the move from linebacker to edge defender. If he maintains that production while continuing to improve as a pass rusher, he could soon become a bona fide star.

Baltimore Ravens: S Malaki Starks

Starks served as a respectable understudy to veterans Kyle Hamilton and Alohi Gilman in Baltimore’s secondary this season. He earned a solid 68.9 PFF overall grade across more than 1,000 snaps in his rookie season. Starks’ 79.9 PFF run-defense grade was a top-20 mark among qualified safeties, and he should continue to improve in coverage with more experience.

Buffalo Bills: DI Deone Walker

Walker was a fourth-round pick who always had the potential to outperform his draft slot. He did so immediately, playing 549 snaps this season and placing second among Buffalo’s defensive linemen with a 78.3 PFF pass-rush grade. Walker tallied 20 pressures, two sacks, five batted passes and even an interception in the team’s playoff game against the Broncos. His development will be a major storyline in 2026 as the Bills try to improve their defense for a Super Bowl run.

Carolina Panthers: WR Jalen Coker

Coker missed the first six games of the 2025 season due to injury and took a while to find his rhythm as he recovered. He became a key piece for Carolina’s offense during the stretch run, and his production crescendoed with a 134-yard outing in the team’s playoff loss to the Rams. Those efforts resulted in Coker earning a 75.3 PFF receiving grade this season, which would be incredibly useful if he can play all 17 games in 2026.

Chicago Bears: T Ozzy Trapilo

Trapilo’s respectable level of play once he was inserted into the starting lineup may have earned him the Bears’ left tackle job heading into 2026. From Week 12 through the wild-card round, Trapilo earned a 73.5 PFF overall grade — a top-30 figure among qualified offensive tackles. It should be noted that he had not played left tackle since 2022, so there should be further improvement in store.

Cincinnati Bengals: T Amarius Mims

After a season and a half full of consistent struggles, Mims may have turned a corner late in the season, potentially changing the complexion of Cincinnati’s offensive line. From Week 12 through Week 18, Mims earned an 81.0 PFF overall grade that ranked 13th among qualified offensive tackles. He also did not allow a sack across his final eight games of the season.

Cleveland Browns: DI Mason Graham

Graham put together a consistent, though not necessarily flashy, debut season in the NFL. He racked up 36 pressures as a pass rusher and improved after a bumpy first few weeks in run defense. From Weeks 7 through 18, Graham earned a 73.8 PFF overall grade that ranked 16th among qualified defensive tackles. If he adds strength in his first full NFL offseason, Graham could become the impact player that Cleveland drafted him to be.

Dallas Cowboys: LB DeMarvion Overshown

Overshown returned from a devastating knee injury that ended his 2024 season to produce a respectable 67.4 PFF overall grade across 218 snaps in 2025. Dallas has now seen nearly 1,000 snaps of solid play from Overshown across his first two seasons. Dallas needs all the defensive help it can get, and the team should be able to rely on a healthy Overshown to improve the unit in 2026.

Denver Broncos: WR Pat Bryant

Bryant didn’t get many opportunities in the first half of his rookie season, but he became a reliable contributor to Denver’s offense down the stretch. Since Week 8, he produced a solid 73.0 PFF receiving grade while placing third on the team with 364 receiving yards. He should continue to garner further opportunities alongside Courtland Sutton and Troy Franklin in 2026.

Detroit Lions: G Tate Ratledge

Ratledge did a fine job as Detroit’s starting right guard in his rookie season while leading the team with 1,088 offensive snaps played. His 70.3 PFF overall grade and 73.5 PFF run-blocking grade both ranked second among qualified rookie guards. Another year of improvement in pass protection, where he excelled while at Georgia, could turn Ratledge into a well-above-average starter in the near future.

Green Bay Packers: WR Matthew Golden

Golden’s playing time drastically declined when Christian Watson returned from injury in Week 8. However, he showed up when it mattered most with 84 yards and a 90.0 PFF receiving grade in Green Bay’s playoff loss to the Bears. Romeo Doubs will be a free agent this offseason, which should provide Golden the opportunity to start in 2026.

Houston Texans: WR Jayden Higgins

Higgins took a while to get going, but he brought his trademark brand of reliable football to Houston during the second half of his rookie season. From Week 10 through the divisional round, Higgins earned a 77.3 PFF receiving grade, tying him for 20th among qualified wide receivers. As expected when he was drafted, he displayed his excellent hands all season, dropping just one pass. Higgins should garner a heavier target share in 2026.

Indianapolis Colts: T Jalen Travis

Travis, a rookie fourth-round pick, didn’t see significant action until the Colts’ final five games this season. As he filled in for the team’s injured starting tackles, Travis showed he could be a capable starter. In those five games, four of them at right tackle, he earned a solid 72.1 PFF overall grade while allowing just one sack. Starting right tackle Braden Smith seems likely to depart in free agency, so Travis will have a prime opportunity to succeed Smith in that role.

Jacksonville Jaguars: RB Bhayshul Tuten

Starting running back Travis Etienne Jr. will be a free agent this offseason, and it’s unclear whether he will remain in Jacksonville. The team could look for reinforcements at the position, but 2026 could serve as a prime opportunity for Tuten to seize the starting role. Tuten recorded a respectable 67.7 PFF rushing grade this season while forcing 19 missed tackles across just 87 carries. An expanded role in the passing game could also lead to his breakout.

Kansas City Chiefs: CB Nohl Williams

Jaylen Watson and Joshua Williams are both set to be free agents this offseason, which could open the door for some cornerback competition in Kansas City. Of course, the Chiefs seem to have found another productive defensive back in 2025 third-round pick Nohl Williams. The rookie out of California earned a solid 75.6 PFF coverage grade this season while breaking up four passes. He should have every opportunity to earn a starting role in 2026.

Las Vegas Raiders: RB Ashton Jeanty

While Jeanty rushed for nearly 1,000 yards in his debut campaign, he did so at an incredibly inefficient rate. He averaged just 3.7 yards per carry, and more than 80% of his yards came after contact. That was primarily the result of Las Vegas' 30th-ranked PFF run-blocking grade. If the team can improve its offensive line and quarterback play, Jeanty could be set on a path toward greater production in 2026.

Los Angeles Chargers: S R.J. Mickens

The sixth-round pick made 11 appearances, including six starts, and earned a 70.8 PFF overall grade in the process. His fundamentally sound play style fit in perfectly with the Chargers’ secondary, and he reeled in two interceptions to boot. Veteran Tony Jefferson will be a free agent, so Mickens could assume an expanded role in 2026.

Los Angeles Rams: TE Terrance Ferguson

The Rams love their multiple-tight-end sets, and veteran Tyler Higbee is slated to be a free agent this offseason. That leaves Colby Parkinson and Terrance Ferguson as the top internal options remaining at the position. Parkinson is a favorite of quarterback Matthew Stafford, but Ferguson racked up 250 receiving yards and three touchdowns this season, including postseason play. Incredibly, he produced that yardage total across just 12 receptions. More big plays from Ferguson should be in store in 2026.

Miami Dolphins: T Patrick Paul

Paul proved himself capable of being Miami’s starting left tackle in 2025 after increasing his PFF overall grade by more than 20 points from his poor 2024 mark. He earned a solid 74.4 PFF pass-blocking grade while allowing just four sacks this season. Miami has very few constants on its roster right now, but Paul’s presence and potential improvement at left tackle are major assets for a team seemingly entering a rebuild.

Minnesota Vikings: EDGE Dallas Turner

Turner may have finally found his footing during the second half of this season. From Weeks 10 through 18, the former first-round pick racked up 24 pressures and seven sacks while ranking 16th among qualified edge rushers in PFF pass-rush grade (76.5). Turner also seemed to find further comfort in run defense, which could make him a more viable three-down player in 2026.

New England Patriots: WR Kyle Williams

New England is suddenly flush with playmaking wide receivers, including Stefon Diggs, Kayshon Boutte and Demario Douglas. But Kyle Williams could further enter the fray after displaying flashes of his big-play ability in 2025. He has averaged 19.6 yards per reception and scored three touchdowns across just 11 receptions.

New Orleans Saints: WR Devaughn Vele

Vele's 293 receiving yards this season may not seem like much, but he started to develop a nice rapport with quarterback Tyler Shough before missing the Saints' final three games due to injury. From Weeks 12 through 15, Vele earned an 84.7 PFF receiving grade while averaging nearly 60 yards per game. The Saints are searching for reliable weapons alongside Chris Olave, and Vele could be an option.

New York Giants: QB Jaxson Dart

Dart was certainly in the spotlight during his rookie season, and he earned a respectable 68.4 PFF overall grade with an injury-ravaged supporting cast. Star wide receiver Malik Nabers suffered a season-ending injury in Dart’s first start. Running back Cam Skattebo suffered his own season-ending injury in Week 8. Left tackle Andrew Thomas also missed four games. Armed with a healthier supporting cast and a new coaching staff, Dart has a chance to improve significantly in 2026.

New York Jets: DI Jowon Briggs

Briggs experienced something of a breakout in 2025, which unexpectedly came in the form of pass-rush production. He earned an outstanding 85.6 PFF pass-rush grade this season while racking up 38 pressures. Briggs was known as more of a run stuffer in college and with the Cleveland Browns, but his PFF run-defense grade dipped to 55.5 this season. If he returns to form on the ground and maintains his excellent pass-rush numbers, he could quietly become a star in the Jets’ defense.

Philadelphia Eagles: LB Jihaad Campbell

Campbell got his opportunity to start in the absence of Nakobe Dean early in the season and performed very well. His playing time diminished when Dean returned, but Dean is set to be a free agent this offseason. Across his 10 starts, Campbell earned an excellent 82.1 PFF overall grade while missing just four tackles. He should soon become a mainstay in the Eagles’ defense alongside Zack Baun.

Pittsburgh Steelers: T Troy Fautanu

After missing nearly all of his rookie season due to injury, Fautanu seemed to find his footing in 2025. Bear in mind that he was still adjusting to playing right tackle, where he had logged just two snaps in college at Washington. He played well across 1,000 snaps this season, earning a 69.4 PFF pass-blocking grade and allowing just three sacks all year. Fautanu should be able to sustain and improve upon that production in 2026.

San Francisco 49ers: CB Upton Stout

Stout, a third-round pick, quickly became the 49ers’ primary nickel cornerback and improved as the season progressed. From Week 11 through the divisional round, Stout earned an 81.6 PFF overall grade, which ranked sixth among all qualified cornerbacks. That mark also ranked second behind Denver’s Ja'Quan McMillian among primary slot cornerbacks. The 49ers likely found a gem in Stout, and he should continue to improve as their nickel in 2026.

Seattle Seahawks: G Grey Zabel

Zabel has battled all season as the Seahawks’ starting left guard and is playing his best football in the most important moments of his team’s season. Since Week 14, Zabel has earned an 80.6 PFF overall grade — the ninth-best mark among all qualified guards in that span. That includes two outstanding performances, both of which earned him 80.0-plus grade, against the rival 49ers. Zabel has future Pro Bowler written all over him if he continues his late-season pace.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers: CB Jacob Parrish

Parrish filled a variety of roles for the Buccaneers this season. His 69.3 PFF overall grade ranked second among qualified rookie cornerbacks. He intercepted two passes while breaking up three others en route to a respectable 66.6 PFF coverage grade. More impressively, he owned a 78.5 PFF run-defense grade — a top-15 mark at his position. Parrish should be a mainstay in Tampa Bay’s secondary heading into 2026.

Tennessee Titans: S Kevin Winston Jr.

Winston didn’t see the field much until the second half of the season, but he displayed flashes of starting potential, particularly in the run game. His 89.4 PFF run-defense grade led all qualified safeties. Winston will need to improve upon his poor 43.4 PFF coverage grade, but his new defensive-minded head coach, Robert Saleh, should be able to find a valuable role for him.

Washington Commanders: T Josh Conerly Jr.

Conerly’s 59.9 PFF overall grade for the season may not portray an imminent breakout, but he improved down the stretch. From Weeks 9 through 18, Conerly ranked just outside the top 30 qualified tackles with his 71.6 PFF overall grade. He allowed just two sacks in that time frame while stabilizing his play in the run game. The Commanders should be very encouraged by what they saw from Conerly during the second half of the campaign.",https://media.pff.com/2026/01/Golden-Matthew-Feature-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=675,N,,2026-01-27 13:06:01.097522

The victory is not the only thing the team can feel good about coming out of Sunday. The Patriots also seem to have avoided any substantial injuries along the way — or have they? After all, there has been some online speculation following the game that starting quarterback Drake Maye may have sustained a right shoulder injury.

Let’s assess both his and the team’s overall injury status after rewatching the game and based on the information we have available as of Tuesday morning.

Patriots injury analysis: AFC Championship Game

LB Robert Spillane: The Patriots’ defensive signal caller remained on the ground after making a tackle on a short run with 3:37 left in the first quarter, and slammed his helmet in frustration afterwards. He eventually walked off the field under his own power, but went straight into the blue medical tent for further evaluation. Spillane eventually departed for the locker room and was announced as questionable to return to the contest because of an ankle injury. However, he reemerged in the second period and tried out his ankle on the sideline. Ultimately, though, he never reentered the game.

QB Drake Maye: New England’s starting quarterback found himself under substantial pressure against the Broncos’ top-tier pass rush, and ended up absorbing five sacks, seven hits, and four tackles on rushing attempts. On one of those, the supposed shoulder injury happened: with 3:46 to go in the third quarter, Maye scrambled up the middle and was taken down by safety Talanoa Hufanga. He landed on his right throwing shoulder, and his hand indeed went up to it immediately; he very well could have just been adjusting his shoulder pads, though, because he also did the same on the left afterwards. All of that is speculation, of course. What we do know is that Maye stayed in the game and did not show any unexpected signs of discomfort despite taking another hit and tackle later in the game. He also completed a 31-yards pass just two plays after the play in question.

What this means for the Patriots

The two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl are traditionally filled with speculation, rumors and storylines that very well may turn out to be inconsequential for the outcome of the game. Drake Maye’s supposed shoulder injury is a candidate to fall into all those categories as well.

The 23-year-old himself, after all, looked good and the field and also did not sound overly worried during his postgame presser.

“Got some bumps and bruises, but, hey, that’s what it takes,” he said. “I think a lot of those guys in that locker room are battling through things, and I think at the same time the best thing about it is we get another chance at it. Another chance to get healthy — two weeks and we’ll go into some nicer weather, knock on some wood. We’ll see. But a chance to go win the Super Bowl. I mean that’s what it is. That’s pretty cool.”

Obviously, time will tell what exactly happened and whether there is cause for concern. The same is true for Robert Spillane as well.

The team captain previously missed four games because of an ankle injury, meaning that his situation is one worth monitoring coming out of the AFC title game. However, the fact that he was allowed to return to the sideline and possible return to the game if the situation had called for it can be interpreted as a positive sign.

Ultimately, however, we will have to wait for more information to come out. Some might come on Tuesday via head coach Mike Vrabel; some might come on Thursday when the team returns to practice.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7SiB4YYlNaZPbYSYusSv6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/sb_nation_articles_115/5f6d1adbba5d55b37623bb99f83d37af,N,,2026-01-27 13:06:05.671718

Seattle went toe-to-toe with Los Angeles in this one, as quarterback Sam Darnold managed to outduel Matthew Stafford with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line. However, Darnold and several other players were battling through injuries in this one, which will surely loom large as the Super Bowl draws near. On Monday morning, Macdonald provided injury updates on several of Seattle’s banged-up players.

Mike Macdonald Reveals Injury Updates After Seahawks Beat Rams

Throughout the Seahawks’ playoff run, injuries have been a pretty important topic of discussion. Right before the team’s divisional round matchup against the San Francisco 49ers, Darnold suffered an oblique injury that threw his status for the game up in the air. While he ended up playing, Darnold is still dealing with this in the wake of Seattle’s huge win in the NFC Championship Game.

The good news for the Seahawks is that they will get an extra week of rest and recovery ahead of the Super Bowl. While they aren’t exactly dealing with any major injuries ahead of this contest, guys like Darnold are dealing with various bumps and bruises that could have an impact on the outcome of this game.

Several other injuries popped up in the team’s win over the Rams. Starting left tackle Charles Cross has been dealing with a lingering foot injury, while fullback Brady Russell and linebacker Drake Thomas were forced out of the game early with new ailments. When speaking about the team’s injury situation, though, Macdonald didn’t sound particularly concerned about the status of any of his players.

“(Brady Russell’s) got something with his hand, so we’ve got to work through that,” Macdonald said on “Brock & Salk.” “Charles is gonna be sore, Sam is gonna be sore. Drake (Thomas) has got a shoulder (injury). There’s a couple of other things we’re gonna work through, but nothing major, to our knowledge.”

I'm going to sort through all of that and try to make sense of the two conference title games and what they mean. Let's start in the NFC.

Jump to:

NE-DEN | LAR-SEA

Seahawks 31, Rams 27

Sam Darnold finally came through. Regardless of what happens in the Super Bowl, Darnold has officially completed the rewrite of his career and gone from disappointing draft pick and journeyman to a meaningful part of a great team. And now, after definitively conquering a Rams team that seemed to have carved out a home in Darnold's head, he's one win away from a Super Bowl title nobody could have expected.

Even as Darnold rose from the depths of the time he spent with coaches Adam Gase and Matt Rhule on hopeless teams, it was always easy to qualify his successes. He was playing in a dream situation with the Vikings in 2024 given the coaching staff and playmakers, and advanced metrics saw him as something closer to an average quarterback. His brutal end to that season against the Lions and Rams in consecutive weeks convinced the Vikings that they were better off moving forward with J.J. McCarthy as a less-expensive solution under center.

Darnold joined the Seahawks, and for three months, he was the NFL's most efficient QB. That success, however, also came within a play-action-heavy scheme and with a breakout superstar in receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and when Darnold met the Rams again in Week 11, he cratered in a 21-19 loss. The 2018 No. 3 pick dropped from first in the NFL in Total QBR before the Rams game to 27th the rest of the way.

Even as the Seahawks beat the Rams in their December rematch, the story of that game was more about what surrounded Darnold. He averaged less than 1 air yard per throw in the first half, as the Seahawks tried to limit Darnold's exposure to the Rams' pass rush. Darnold threw two picks, giving him six in two games against Los Angeles, but he made a handful of important throws during the team's fourth-quarter comeback and in overtime to help lead the Seahawks to a 38-37 victory.

The Seahawks hadn't needed Darnold since then; they had relied on their defense and a resurgent running game to fuel their success down the stretch. That wasn't the case Sunday. Running back Kenneth Walker III had a great game in terms of making unblocked or underblocked defenders miss, but Seahawks backs turned 22 carries into just 66 rushing yards. And a dominant Seahawks defense came up with a critical stop in the fourth quarter to hold on to a four-point lead, but the Rams again had little trouble marching up and down the field, averaging more than 8 yards per play and scoring 27 points. The Seahawks needed a great game from Darnold.

They got one. Darnold went 25-of-36 for 346 yards with three touchdown passes. His 82.9 Total QBR was the second-best performance by a quarterback this postseason, trailing only Josh Allen's herculean effort to beat the Jaguars in the wild-card round. Without much of a running game throughout the night, Darnold thrived as a dropback passer, throwing for a season-high 248 yards and two touchdowns without play fakes. The game was put on Darnold's shoulders, and he repeatedly responded with accurate throws.

Perhaps as important, the negative plays that sparked so much frustration against the Rams in the past mostly disappeared. Darnold wasn't intercepted and put only one ball in danger all night. He took three sacks, two of which came on plays in which pass rushers were instantly on Darnold, leaving him no choice but go down and eat the football.

Darnold's struggles dealing with sustained pressure have been career-altering moments in the past, but he went 5-of-11 for 102 yards and hit all three of his touchdown passes against pressure. The visible panic and frustration Darnold has shown at times, particularly against these Rams, simply wasn't there. Darnold had been on either side of the timing paradigm, either trying to extend plays and taking too many sacks or getting sped up and getting the ball out too quickly while getting tricked into interceptions. He was repeatedly on time, even under pressure, in the NFC title game.

Organizationally, it seemed the Seahawks realized that their only way through the Rams was with Darnold involved and playing well, too. There was no repeat of the hide-the-QB game plan from the first half of Week 16, as Darnold hit Rashid Shaheed up the sideline for 51 yards on the first third down of the game and averaged 8.6 air yards per throw during Sunday's contest.

And after the Seahawks got their fourth-quarter stop and handed the ball back to Darnold with a four-point lead, Seattle was able to bleed the Rams dry of timeouts and burn most of the remaining clock by staying aggressive and throwing the football. Darnold dropped back five times on second and third downs, and he rewarded the Seahawks for their faith. On a second-and-6 inside Seattle's 10-yard line, offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak dialed up hard play-action and trusted Darnold to turn his back to the defense without giving the ball up. And the QB made the correct decision to check down to Walker, who ran away from a tackle and picked up a first down.

Darnold missed an open Shaheed on the ensuing second down on one of his worst throws of the night, but he made up for it by hitting Cooper Kupp on a crosser on the next play to pick up another first down. With 3:05 to go on the next second down, the Seahawks went back to play-action, and Darnold escaped the pocket to hit Smith-Njigba for another first down on the run. And with 2:17 left, another boot off play-action drew a holding penalty on Rams cornerback Cobie Durant, preventing Los Angeles from getting the ball back with anything more than a prayer. Darnold also hung on to the ball on the ensuing third down when nobody blocked defensive tackle Braden Fiske, who ran over the Seattle quarterback on what appeared to be a busted play.

It's not dismissing Darnold's performance to say that his receivers helped. Shaheed, who had previously made a massive impact as a runner and return man without really contributing as a receiver, finally brought in a deep shot in the opening quarter. Smith-Njigba made a spectacular one-handed catch and spun Kam Curl around on a corner-post route for a 42-yard gain. Kubiak got Smith-Njigba wide open for a touchdown on a blown coverage, lining the star wideout up in the backfield and running him into the end zone on a sail route. Kupp picked up three critical third downs. Heck, Jake Bobo stepped in and ran a post-corner route of his own for a score.

Of course, having a great game against the Rams doesn't inoculate Darnold from struggling in the future. He'll be criticized if he doesn't play well in the Super Bowl. But the idea that having Darnold as your quarterback was disqualifying to your chances of competing for a title? That the journeyman QB would fold when the games really mattered against great defenses? Those lines of thought are out the window. Darnold just outplayed and beat the likely MVP in Matthew Stafford to go to a Super Bowl. For so long, Darnold's past has felt like prologue. Now, it's just the past.

The Rams, meanwhile, will feel like their 2025 losses all blend together. While Stafford and the offense turned the ball over six total times in two inexplicable defeats to the Falcons and Panthers, L.A.'s four other losses generally shared similar scripts. The Rams had weaknesses, and those weaknesses were exploitable. And while they had enough talent and star power to cover up those problems, subpar execution at the wrong time had a way of costing them close games against upper-echelon competition.

If the Rams were losing a big game this season, this was the typical script:

1. The special teams were a disaster. The Rams finished the season 26th in DVOA there, and even that might undersell how dramatically Sean McVay's special teams came up short in key moments. A pair of blocked field goals cost them a win over the Eagles in Week 3. Another block and a miss helped decide a loss to the 49ers in Week 5. The Rams also missed a 48-yard field goal and allowed a Shaheed punt-return touchdown to help fuel the comeback win by the Seahawks in Week 16, leading McVay to fire special teams coordinator Chase Blackburn two days later.

Things haven't gotten much better since then, although the Rams had previously managed to overcome those issues. The Panthers blocked an Ethan Evans punt with 4:18 to go in the fourth quarter in the wild-card round, turning the ensuing short field into a touchdown to take the lead. Evans then managed only a 33-yard punt late in the fourth quarter against the Bears, setting Chicago up at midfield as it drove for the game-tying touchdown at the end of regulation. In both cases, the Rams were able to win the game despite those issues.

They weren't quite as lucky Sunday. This time, punt returner Xavier Smith was to blame. The 28-year-old muffed two punts, and he fell on the first, but wasn't as lucky on the second, as Smith fell over in what must have felt like slow motion before the ball bounced off his body early in the third quarter. The Seahawks recovered on Los Angeles' 17-yard line, and Darnold hit Bobo for a touchdown on the next play. It was the only turnover of the game, and the short field was likely the difference in what was otherwise a very close contest.

Dareke Young was the Seahawks player who initially pressured Smith and then recovered the loose ball. He ran past Rams cornerback Emmanuel Forbes Jr. on punt coverage. Forbes' performance Sunday was part of another common problem for the Rams in their losses ...

2. Teams were able to pick on the cornerbacks. This was the clear weak spot on GM Les Snead's roster, but the Rams trusted that their scheme and pass rush would be enough to cover for an underwhelming crew of cornerbacks. The only significant move they made to add talent at the position was trading for Titans cornerback Roger McCreary, who didn't play for most of the regular season. Forbes outplayed expectations after struggling to live up to his draft stock in Washington, but teams were able to pick on him in key spots, including plays in the Rams' loss to the Eagles and on a pair of fourth-down scores in their loss to the Panthers in Week 13.

The Rams have spent the entire postseason cycling through their options at corner. Ahkello Witherspoon sustained a shoulder injury early in the wild-card win over the Panthers, ending his season, which led the Rams to bring back Darious Williams, who was a healthy scratch for that contest. Forbes also suffered a shoulder injury and played just four snaps in the Rams' win over the Bears last week, leading to larger roles for Williams and McCreary.

Forbes practiced in full on Friday and had no injury designation heading into the game, but despite being one of the team's regular corners alongside Durant for most of the year, he didn't play a single defensive snap in the first half of Sunday's loss. Forbes did play on special teams, which seemed to suggest that he might not be able to tackle if used on defense -- but then the Rams put the third-year pro on the field for 24 defensive snaps in the second half. If Forbes was healthy enough to play defense after halftime, why wasn't he on the field beforehand?

The answer is the Rams were probably desperate to get Williams off the field at that point. The veteran, whose spot on the roster has likely been a product of his $8 million in salary guarantees this season, was a liability for the Rams early in this game. Shaheed simply torched the 32-year-old for a 51-yard gain on the opening series, with an ankle tackle required to save a touchdown. On the next snap, Williams played off-coverage against Smith-Njigba, with the Seahawks throwing a one-step hitch to their star wideout, who simply vaporized Williams with a juke. Smith-Njigba then picked up 16 yards on a curl against Williams in the second quarter. In all, Williams played just nine defensive snaps in the third quarter and none in the fourth.

Williams wasn't the only cornerback who struggled. Durant had a key third-down pass breakup, but he allowed a touchdown pass to Bobo, appeared to be one of the defenders involved in the blown coverage on the Smith-Njigba score, gave up a critical third-down conversion to Kupp on the final drive and finished the day by being flagged for holding on Kupp to all but end the game.

3. A fourth-down play goes awry. Some of those fourth downs were kicks, but the Rams' loss to the 49ers swung on a red zone fumble by Kyren Williams and a subsequent fourth-down failure in overtime, when McVay regretted dialing up a duo run for Williams on fourth-and-1 in the red zone while trailing by three. The 49ers stuffed it for no gain to end the game.

Last time, McVay blamed himself. This time, after the Rams were stopped on fourth-and-4 from the 6-yard line with 4:59 to go, he had a more curious culprit. I'm not sure I've ever heard a coach blame the other team busting a coverage for stopping their fourth-down play, but that's exactly what McVay did after the game: ""They kinda lucked into having two guys peel on Kyren right there. I know that can't be part of their design. So it was a fortuitous bust by them.""

I wouldn't judge Seahawks fans for seeing that quote and screaming about sour grapes, but let's understand what happened from McVay's perspective, too. On the fourth-and-4, the Seahawks were crowding the line of scrimmage and showing a zero blitz, suggesting to Stafford that he needed to get the ball out quickly. At the snap, they actually dropped out and rushed only three, bracketing Puka Nacua in the slot.

McVay has grown fond of throwing the ball to Williams on third and fourth downs this season on choice routes, where Williams has a lot of open space and the ability to break inside or outside depending on the leverage of the coverage. It's a natural place to go with the football when we consider how much attention teams are putting on Nacua and Davante Adams in key spots. Williams is never getting double-covered in those situations, and if the Rams create space for him with their route distribution, it's almost impossible for the defender to be right.

On this play, Williams released upfield and headed toward the end zone. The end man on the line was safety Julian Love, who looked like he was beat quickly by Williams while trying to drop into coverage, but edge rusher DeMarcus Lawrence also dropped off and ran with Williams, taking away the quick throwing lane for Stafford, who had to work elsewhere. The veteran eventually forced a throw to Terrance Ferguson against tight coverage from Devon Witherspoon, with the pass falling incomplete. Fortuitous coverage bust? Or did Mike Macdonald recognize McVay's tendency of creating space for Williams in key spots and double the right guy at the right time? Ultimately, it doesn't matter; the Rams failed on a key fourth down, and they never came close to taking the lead again.

There was another factor that hasn't typically been a problem in 2025. McVay has massively improved his game management and fourth-down decision-making this season after lagging behind the rest of the league for most of his tenure as a head coach. On Sunday, though, McVay made two obvious mistakes, and they might very well have changed the game.

Late in the third quarter, the Rams got a huge break courtesy of Seahawks corner Riq Woolen, who dropped a pick, was then flagged for taunting to give the Rams a first down, and then immediately allowed a long touchdown pass to Nacua on the next play. While the Rams were perhaps still emotionally recovering on the sideline from Woolen's vicious taunting, McVay made a simple mistake.

The touchdown put the Rams down five at 31-26, pending the extra point. McVay kicked. There's not a huge win probability swing by kicking there, given how much time was left, but ESPN's win probability model suggests that teams should go for two in that situation if they have even a 33% chance of converting. The Rams, with a historically efficient rushing attack, certainly would trust their chances of converting at a higher rate.

Coaches aren't necessarily thinking about those endgame scenarios late in the third quarter, and there's an old coaching trope about how teams shouldn't go for two until the fourth quarter, even if the current score suggests that a 2-pointer would be valuable. It's one of those numbers-based arguments that never seems to hold up under scrutiny. Conservative coaches and announcers often justify taking the points and kicking field goals early in games by using the present score and plugging in what a field goal would do; indeed, we'll talk in a minute about the Broncos, who were supposed to take the points and go up 10-0 to make the game a two-score contest in the second quarter.

Why should the present score matter if you take the points but not matter if you're going for two? The benefits of going for two down five are obvious: You'd need a touchdown to win whether you're down four or five, but if you get the 2-pointer, you'd be down three and can tie the game with a field goal. You wouldn't know if you'll need that 2-pointer, but you also don't know whether that field goal to make it a two-possession game in the first half will end up being essential by the end of the day, either.

Computers can do a better job of sorting through all the various scenarios of how many possessions are left and how likely each team is to score in advance of a 2-point decision like that, but the simplest argument is to act on what the score is right now. And after a 28-point third quarter, neither team scored in the fourth, meaning that the Rams really did need that 2-pointer.

If the Rams had failed and stayed down five, their endgame wouldn't have changed. If they had succeeded and been down three, of course, the Rams could have kicked a field goal to tie the game with 4:59 to go on fourth-and-4. Instead, down by four points, they had no choice but to try scoring a touchdown.

The other mistake came on the ensuing possession. While the refs ruled that Kupp's catch on third-and-7 gave the Seahawks a first down, the initial replays seemed to hint that the veteran wideout might have been just short of the sticks. McVay called his second timeout, then had his challenge flag in his hand, but he didn't risk using his final timeout to challenge the spot.

This was a clear mistake. Given a tight spot and the game situation, McVay very clearly should have just thrown the challenge flag to have the spot reviewed as opposed to calling a traditional timeout. If the challenge had failed, nothing would have changed: The Rams would have essentially burned a timeout to stop the clock. And if the challenge succeeded, of course, the Rams wouldn't have lost a timeout and could have used it to stop the clock in advance of a fourth-down decision by Seattle.

Coaches don't want to waste challenges, but there was virtually no downside here. The Rams were a minute away from the two-minute warning, at which point all challenges come from the replay booth. McVay had two challenges remaining. Unless he thought that the initial spot was ruled short on the field, believed it was fourth down and used his timeout before learning otherwise, this was a missed opportunity.

Those decisions didn't single-handedly decide the game, but the Rams stacked some sloppy decision-making and work on the field. Stafford and the rest of the offense couldn't overcome those mistakes.

Patriots 10, Broncos 7

Nobody said it had to be pretty. The most memorable game of the 2001 Patriots' trip to the Super Bowl was their divisional-round win over the Raiders in Foxborough. While we call that the ""Tuck Rule"" game because of the fateful call that overturned a Tom Brady fumble, the most impressive play from that matchup was Adam Vinatieri's 45-yard field goal in whiteout conditions to tie the game with 27 seconds to go. The legendary kicker then hit a 23-yarder in overtime, sending the Pats to the AFC title game and eventually to a stunning Super Bowl victory.

Sunday's win over the Broncos won't be quite as memorable. It was decided by a 23-yard field goal from Andy Borregales, but that kick came early in the third quarter and was the only successful try out of five attempts by the two kickers in this game. Conditions were fine during the first half, but by midway through the third quarter, weather took over the contest and reduced the game to something out of the 1970s, both in terms of play selection and video fidelity.

The Broncos managed just 32 yards and one first down over their five possessions in the second half. Jarrett Stidham got off to a solid start, but after the first quarter, his 26 dropbacks produced just 37 net yards. Denver's best chance of scoring in the second half came after a brutal 33-yard punt by Bryce Baringer, which handed the Broncos the ball in field goal range, only for Wil Lutz's 45-yard kick to be blocked.

Stidham made the game's biggest mistake, though. Facing pressure on a third-and-4, he drifted backward and tried to get outside the pocket to avoid an intentional grounding penalty. Stidham tried to flip the ball out just as he was hit by Christian Elliss. The play was initially ruled as grounding before being reevaluated as a backward pass and fumble. The Pats were denied a defensive touchdown by the referees blowing the play dead, but Drake Maye ran a touchdown in from 6 yards out to tie the game at 7.

The Broncos will feel like they missed an opportunity. Maye and the Patriots' offense did little in this game, struggling to consistently move the ball even before the weather arrived. Just two of New England's 12 drives yielded more than one first down. Denver safety Talanoa Hufanga dropped what would have been an interception on the Pats' opening series of the game, with the Broncos fooling Maye in coverage as the second-year star tried to throw a slant to Stefon Diggs.

If Stidham just goes down for a harmless sack on that third-and-4 and the Broncos punt the ball away, they might have been OK. The weather might have kept the Patriots from having any chance of scoring in the fourth quarter.

Sean Payton was second-guessed during and after the game for deciding against kicking a field goal to go up 10-0 early in the second quarter. With Denver facing a fourth-and-1 on New England's 14-yard line, the ESPN Analytics model was very comfortable with Payton's decision at the time. (Running the ball might have been preferable, though, to the Broncos putting the ball in the hands of their backup quarterback.)

Payton might have wanted to play for a low-scoring game if he knew the weather system was going to be as severe as it was by the second half, but the way the game played out is evidence of how valuable a touchdown can be in this sort of contest. If the Broncos kick a field goal and nothing else changes, the score's 10-10, and the game goes to overtime, where they have a 50-50 shot of winning. If they convert and score a touchdown and nothing else changes, they win 14-10 and go to the Super Bowl. Given how little the Patriots were able to do on offense, 14 points might very well have been insurmountable.

The other what-if will be more painful, given that the Broncos didn't have Bo Nix on Sunday. Nix had his ups and downs this season, but he was essentially a league-average starter for the second consecutive year, and that's a lot better than Stidham, who wasn't able to do much after the scripted plays ran out. He hit Marvin Mims Jr. with a great throw past a flat-footed Christian Gonzalez for a 52-yard gain to set up Denver's only touchdown. But Stidham's six other throws of 10 or more yards downfield produced just 6 yards.

Ending the year without Nix was obviously unlucky, and the Broncos were without wideout Troy Franklin and lost fellow wideout Pat Bryant to an injury for the second consecutive week. But this was a relatively healthy team in 2025, with Nix and safety Brandon Jones (who was hurt late in the year) as the only starters to finish the season on injured reserve. The Broncos were also one of the league's oldest teams on a snap-weighted age basis, and so while the Broncos do have some young stars, Payton has relied on veterans and free agent additions to help make them competitive. That nearly led them to a Super Bowl, but after going 9-2 in one-score games and adding a 10th close win against the Bills last week, the Broncos weren't able to squeak out another narrow win at home in the AFC Championship Game.

Given those factors, it's tough to imagine them being back here again in 2026, although it's fair to say there weren't many people who expected the Broncos to be hosting the Patriots in this game at the start of the season, either.

As for the Patriots, well, they might be even more difficult to evaluate now than they were before the postseason. Before the playoffs, everybody could agree that Maye was playing lights-out football and that the Pats had benefited from playing an easy schedule. They eventually finished, per Pro-Football-Reference.com's methodology, with the 10th-easiest regular-season schedule for any team since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. The postseason was supposed to be a test of whether the Patriots were for real.

Winning means you pass the test, of course, but it's not exactly happening the way we would have expected. Maye has struggled through a difficult postseason, running a 51.1 Total QBR, which was roughly about what Tyler Shough had during the regular season. He has held on to the ball too long, fumbled six times and thrown two interceptions, although he was able to make it through Sunday's game without turning the ball over.

Maye has made a handful of perfect throws during this run, including a flea-flicker to Mack Hollins that served as his only completion of more than 10 yards on Sunday. He has also made an impact with his legs, which was Maye's primary contribution in the Pat's win over the Broncos. He turned 10 carries into 65 yards, including a 6-yard touchdown and scrambles of 13, 16 and 28 yards, which set up the game-winning field goal and two Borregales misses. Maye sealed the AFC up by keeping the ball on a third-down naked bootleg and outrunning Jonah Elliss to the sideline for a first down to end the game. It wasn't a memorable passing performance, but Maye still found a way to add meaningful value on a day when the Pats couldn't do much on offense.

And ironically enough, if Maye does end up winning the Super Bowl, this will go down as one of the more impressive runs through defensive juggernauts by any quarterback in recent memory. By EPA per play rankings, Maye has already beaten the third- (Texans), sixth- (Chargers) and seventh-best (Broncos) defenses in football. He's about to face the best by this metric in the Seahawks in Super Bowl LX. I won't argue that he has been anywhere near as impressive in the playoffs as he was during the regular season, but if Maye wins in two weeks, there can't be many quarterbacks who have beaten four of the league's top seven defenses in a single postseason run.

Instead, the story of the playoffs for the Patriots has been their defense. While advanced metrics were still fond of Maye even after adjusting for quality of opposition, the same wasn't true for the defense. New England's defense finished the season 23rd in DVOA and 18th in ESPN's Football Power Index. The Pats lost star defensive tackle Milton Williams to a midseason ankle injury before returned in Week 18, but they weren't rated as a top-10 unit even before he went down.

Since the start of the postseason, though, the Pats have suffocated opposing offenses. They've allowed a total of 26 points through three games. With the offense struggling, Zak Kuhr's defense has also faced a ton of possessions, making that an even more impressive figure. The Pats are allowing just 0.72 points per drive in the playoffs. Since 2000, the only team to play three postseason games on their side of the bracket and allow fewer points per drive is the 2000 Ravens, who were one of the most dominant defenses in NFL history.

Of course, as always with the 2025 Patriots, there are reasons to be skeptical. Every team the Pats have faced was compromised by injuries. The Chargers were down their top two offensive tackles (Joe Alt and Rashawn Slater) and couldn't protect Justin Herbert. The Texans entered their divisional-round game without Nico Collins and then lost Dalton Schultz in the first half, costing C.J. Stroud his top two receivers. And the Broncos were starting Stidham, who hadn't thrown an NFL pass in two years, with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line. Throw in some messy weather to help out the defense, and we can talk ourselves into the Pats' defense being a mirage.

The truth is somewhere in between. This unit was unlucky in terms of red zone performance during the regular season, ranking fifth by EPA per play outside the red zone and 28th inside the 20. The Patriots really did miss Williams, who had three of the team's five quick pressures on Sunday. K'Lavon Chaisson has had a career year, and he had a much-needed solid performance with Harold Landry III sidelined, but the strength of the Pats' pass rush is the interior pressure from Williams and Christian Barmore.

Their other strength is at cornerback, and that's where the story might crystallize. When the Patriots signed Carlton Davis III this offseason in free agency, it seemed they were establishing a clear plan of playing plenty of man coverage. The Pats had been one of the league's most man-heavy defenses under Bill Belichick and Jerod Mayo, and in Gonzalez, they already possessed one of the league's finest young cover corners. Combining Gonzalez and Davis gave the Pats the freedom to do whatever they wanted in coverage.

During the regular season, though, the Pats didn't really play much man, perhaps to make life easier for rookie safety Craig Woodson. They were in man coverage just 37.2% of the time, which ranked 23rd in the league. While Kuhr went to playing man more than 50% of the time in the Pats' Week 15 loss to the Bills, they were generally a zone coverage team. That extended through the first two weeks of the postseason.

On Sunday, though, the Patriots played man on 50% of Stidham's dropbacks. They dominated Denver's receivers in the process. Stidham went 11-of-16 for 97 yards against zone looks, but the Broncos starter was 6-of-15 for just 36 yards with a touchdown and an interception (by Gonzalez) against man coverage. Getting into man looks allowed the Pats to blitz Stidham more than 40% of the time, and he averaged just 2.5 yards per pass attempt against the blitz.

Were the Patriots willing to lean into man coverage only because of the presence of Stidham and the dismal weather in Denver? Or was this a sign that they're going to be more aggressive playing man in the Super Bowl? Belichick was famously insistent on stopping the opposing team's top playmaker in big games. And while the Pats could try sticking Gonzalez on Smith-Njigba, Belichick typically preferred to bracket or double-team the opposing team's star while sticking his best cover corner on the opposing team's second-best wideout.

There'll be plenty of more time to talk about that in next week's Super Bowl preview, but on Sunday, the Pats were able to get aggressive on defense and squeak out a close victory.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0126%2Fr1605700_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:06:12.361971

While many eyes will be on the Senior Bowl this week, college all-star games have been going on all month, and the Saints' scouting department has been busy at all of them. Here's a quick look at the buzz from the all-star game circuit.

NFL-FCS Showcase (Nashville, Tenn.)

The Saints were one of several to meet with Alabama State left tackle Desmond Daniels at the FCS Showcase all-star game, per Easton Butler of 247 Sports. Daniels was limited to just four games by a knee injury but already underwent surgery and has returned to practice, which is a good sign, and it's notable that the Saints previously visited Alabama State's campus (per Jaeden Day for the Montgomery Adveritser). Butler added that the Saints were one of eleven teams that met with Colgate wide receiver Treyvhon Saunders at the same event. Saunders finished second in receptions (50) and receiving yards (700), with six touchdowns. Both prospects are potential third-day draft picks in the later rounds.

Hula Bowl (DeLand, Fla.)

At the Hula Bowl, Commanding the Huddle's Ryan Fowler reports the Saints were among many teams that spent time with UTSA linebacker Shad Banks Jr., another Day 3 prospect. Butler also shared that the Saints met with Delaware offensive lineman Fintan Brose (who has started games at every spot but left tackle) at this all-star game. Draft Diamonds senior writer Jimmy Williams noted that more than 20 teams, including the Saints, visited with Georgia Southern wide receiver Camden Brown. New Orleans also met with Kansas running back Leshon Williams, per Sleeper's Arye Pulli. Williams transferred from Iowa to help replace Devin Neal and rushed for 560 yards on just 97 carries. Each of these guys are seen as late-round picks or priority free agents.

College Gridiron Showcase (Fort Worth, Texas)

Reporting from the College Gridiron Showcase, Draft Prep's Malik Boynton listed the Saints among six teams that met with Baylor safety Devyn Bobby. Butler reported that Western Michigan tight end Blake Bosma also spoke with the Saints here; he added that Old Dominion cornerback Botros Alisandro was on their list of visits, too. The Saints met with Troy tight end Ethan Conner here, too, per KPRC2 Houston's Aaron Wilson. These prospects are each hoping to hear their names called in the draft's later rounds.

The American Bowl (Lakeland, Fla.)

Another college all-star game, the American Bowl, had almost half the league (the Saints among them) spending time with James Madison cornerback Elijah Culp, per Butler's reporting. 7 News Boston WHDH's Ethan Hurwitz shared that even more teams, including New Orleans, checked in on Penn State center Nick Dawkins at this event. Butler added that Mississippi State outside linebacker Malick Sylla highlighted his time with the Saints among meetings with 21 different teams. Of the group, Sylla and Dawkins seem likeliest to be drafted.

East-West Shrine Bowl (Frisco, Texas)

Fowler specified that the Saints were one of six teams that interviewed Wake Forest running back Demond Claiborne at the East-West Shrine Bowl, and that they had a formal meeting with him. While they didn't sit down with him in a formal meeting, Butler noted that the Saints and all 31 other teams spent time with Navy defensive tackle Landon Robinson, too. Claiborne could be picked early in Round 4 on the third day of the draft, and Robinson may not be far behind. USA TODAY's Josh Carney reports the Saints met with Louisiana linebacker Jaden Dugger, as did the other 31 teams. He's a draftable prospect in the later rounds.

Of course these are just some of the prospects the Saints have met up with in recent weeks, and we don't know how intensive those conversations are. In many cases it's as simple as a scout or position coach exchanging contact information to set up a later visit. We also only know the meetings that have been reported, and the team is contacting dozens of players each week. Eventually, everybody has spoken with everybody at some point between the all-star games, NFL Scouting Combine, pro day workouts, and formal visits at the team facility. Don't read too deeply into these reports. But they are something to file away for later if a couple of those players do end up in New Orleans.","https://saintswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/26/SSNT/88364892007-usatsi-27953464.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-27 13:06:16.134680

Football is a team sport and there are several reasons why Allen, Jackson and Mayfield have come up short.
Based off his success with the Vikings, the Seahawks gave Darnold a three-year, $100.5 million contract to replace Geno Smith.
“There was a lot that I didn’t know back then, so I’m just going to continue to learn and grow in this great game,” Darnold said.","Sam Darnold will be starting in the Super Bowl before Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen and the rest of the NFL’s Class of 2018 quarterbacks.

It took Darnold five teams and eight seasons to get here.

Darnold led the Seattle Seahawks to a 14-3 record, a division title, the No. 1 seed and was at his best in the NFC championship game.

Seahawks had a brilliant way to get JSN open in NFC title win

Despite an oblique injury, Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns in Seattle’s 31-27 victory over the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday. He completed 25 of 36 passes and had no turnovers.

“He just shut a lot of people up,” Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said. “Really happy for him.”

Labeled a bust early in his career, Darnold was still doubted by critics following his impressive turnaround.

Now, he’s one win away from hoisting the Vince Lombardi Trophy. The Seahawks are 4 1/2-point favorites over the New England Patriots on BetMGM Sportsbook.

Darnold was picked No. 3 overall by the New York Jets in 2018. Baker Mayfield went first to the Cleveland Browns. Allen went to the Buffalo Bills at No. 7. Josh Rosen was chosen 10th by the Arizona Cardinals. The Baltimore Ravens selected Jackson with the final pick of the first round at No. 32.

Jackson has won two AP NFL MVP awards and is 0-1 in the AFC championship game. Allen is the reigning NFL MVP and twice lost to the Chiefs in the AFC title game.

Mayfield led the Browns to their only playoff victory this century and has won two division titles and one playoff game with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, his fourth team.

Rosen was traded by Arizona after going 3-10 as a rookie and is out of the NFL after starting just three more games.

Darnold’s success doesn’t make others failures. Football is a team sport and there are several reasons why Allen, Jackson and Mayfield have come up short. Both Allen and Jackson saw their coaches fired this month because their teams didn’t live up to expectations.

Darnold’s story is about perseverance and redemption. It’s another clear example why coaching matters.

Darnold struggled mightily during three seasons with the Jets playing for coaches Todd Bowles and Adam Gase, and offensive coordinators Jeremy Bates and Dowell Loggains. His 78.2 passer rating during that time ranked third worst among 53 QBs with at least 500 attempts.

Darnold went to Carolina and played two seasons for coaches Matt Rhule and Steve Wilks, and coordinators Jeff Nixon, Joe Brady and Ben McAdoo.

None of them could unlock his potential. He didn’t have the right coaching or supporting cast, and his teams lacked stability.

Then he spent a season with Kyle Shanahan and assistants Klint and Klay Kubiak in San Francisco in 2023. Darnold backed up Brock Purdy on a 49ers team that reached the Super Bowl. He got a chance to watch, learn and study in an environment that fostered growth.

Shanahan praised Darnold’s arm talent, his ability to read defenses and run the offensive scheme.

Darnold went to Minnesota and thrived under coach Kevin O’Connell. He had a breakthrough season in 2024, throwing for 4,319 yards and 35 TDs while having a 102.5 passer rating and leading the Vikings to 14 wins.

But Minnesota chose to stick with J.J. McCarthy, whose injury opened the door for Darnold to play and flourish.

Based off his success with the Vikings, the Seahawks gave Darnold a three-year, $100.5 million contract to replace Geno Smith. He became the first quarterback in NFL history to lead two different teams to 14 wins in consecutive seasons. Tom Brady did it with the Patriots.

“We believe in him. The building believes in him. The city believes in him. It’s awesome to run out onto the field with him,” All-Pro wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba said.

Darnold has come a long way since telling coaches he was “seeing ghosts” during a lopsided loss to the Patriots in his second season.

“There was a lot that I didn’t know back then, so I’m just going to continue to learn and grow in this great game,” Darnold said. “There is a lot of stuff that I can get better from today even. I feel like I missed some throws out there that I shouldn’t miss. There were some things offensively that I feel like we can do better. So, we’re always looking to get better. I’m always looking to get better. That’s the great part about this game is you win an NFC championship and you win games throughout the season, but there is always ways that you can look to get better.”

David J. Chao isn’t so sure, however…

Chao, who spent nearly two decades working as the official team doctor for the then-San Diego Chargers, has transitioned into the world of sports media and provides instant injury analysis for fans of the NFL, NBA and MLB — and made the argument that Maye suffered an injury on Sunday.

“Drake Maye injured his right throwing shoulder against the Broncos,” Chao wrote on X on Monday, with his post accompanied by a four-minute video explaining his totally unsubstantiated diagnosis. “How severe the injury is, and the exact diagnosis, remains to be determined. Heading into Super Bowl LX, I’m far more concerned about Maye’s shoulder than Sam Darnold’s oblique.”

It’s safe to say that his argument is rather shaky, as is his past. Chao has a history of medical malpractice and was sued on two separate occasions with damages awarded totaling over $6 million, according to The Law Offices of Melinda J. Helbock.

What does any of this mean?

Maye’s shoulder will be something to watch for, as he did reach for it on a couple of occasions after taking a hit in the third quarter on Sunday. The Patriots’ first injury report of the week is due on Wednesday, and his appearance or lack thereof will help bring some clarity to an odd situation.

If we don’t see the sophomore signal-caller, it’s safe to say he’ll be ready to go for Super Bowl LX. If we do, there’s a wonder of just how substantial the injury is and whether or not it will impact his availability — though something tells us there isn’t too much to worry about.

On Sunday at Mile High, the AFC's top-seeded Denver Broncos welcomed the New England Patriots with a Super Bowl LX berth at stake. Jarrett Stidham was poised to guide the Broncos into combat, with Bo Nix shockingly sidelined due to a season-ending ankle injury.

CBS handled the broadcast, where veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins was ""intentionally muted"" during pre-game coverage. The network was obliged to break away as Spillane remained on the field in apparent distress, following a controversial national anthem rendition that drew viewer criticism.

The development proved devastating for the Patriots. With 3:37 remaining in the opening quarter, Denver executed a brief rushing play that left Spillane motionless on the ground.

Though he managed to exit the field independently, the 30 year old proceeded directly to the blue medical tent for evaluation. Subsequently, he departed for the locker room and was removed from action.

""They need him. This is big,"" Romo observed as CBS was obligated to transition to commercials.

Spillane serves as a team captain and has become a key voice within the Patriots' defensive unit. He joined New England through a three-year, $33 million free agency contract in March, drawn by the chance to compete under head coach Mike Vrabel.

He swiftly became a cornerstone on defense, valued for both his three-down versatility and leadership qualities. Spillane began the season as New England's top linebacker and participated in 95.4 percent of snaps during the first 13 games of the campaign.

Spillane sustained a foot injury before New England's Week 15 matchup against the Buffalo Bills and missed the rest of the regular season due to this setback. The veteran made his comeback for the playoffs and took the field for a total of 96.3 percent of plays against the Los Angeles Chargers and Houston Texans, recording 12 tackles and a vital pair of pass breakups.

His loss was deeply felt by the Pats as the Broncos looked to capitalize on the opportunity. Denver seized control of the AFC Championship game early, with Stidham connecting on a 6-yard touchdown pass to Courtland Sutton within the opening five minutes.

Following Spillane's departure from the game against Denver, backup Jack Gibbens assumed duties as the Patriots' defensive field general. Gibbens fulfilled that identical responsibility during Spillane's earlier absence this season.

Nevertheless, the Patriots defense performed impressively and will believe the unit earned a touchdown. With 3:11 left in the opening half on third-and-4, Stidham took a hit and seemed to fumble the football, which rolled toward the sideline where Elijah Ponder gathered the loose ball.

The linebacker then sprinted into the end zone without being touched for a defensive score, but officials blew their whistles and ruled the play dead.

The referees initially called the play an incomplete pass and intentional grounding. Following a review, however, they determined it was a fumble recovered by New England, creating an immediate red zone chance. Maye found the end zone to even the contest, sending the Patriots and Broncos into the break tied at 7-7.",https://cdn-images.the-express.com/img/dynamic/47/1200x630/504107.jpg,N,,2026-01-27 13:07:14.433736

Ultimately, Tua Tagovailoa's story is one of talent, resilience, and a clear vision for his future.","It’s easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of professional sports, especially the NFL. For a player like Tua Tagovailoa, that whirlwind has been particularly intense. We've seen him rise, face a significant setback, and now, he's charting his course forward. It’s a story that’s less about flashy headlines and more about resilience.

Back in 2017, Tua was a name on everyone's lips. Leading Alabama to a national championship win as a freshman, he wasn't just a promising talent; he was seen as a future star, potentially the top pick in the NFL draft. His college career was marked by impressive stats and accolades, a testament to his skill and leadership on the field.

But then came November 16th. A devastating hip dislocation against Mississippi State ended his season prematurely. This wasn't just a minor injury; it was a serious blow that cast a shadow over his NFL prospects. Many players in his position might have opted to stay in college, focus on recovery, and perhaps finish their degree. Tua, however, made a different choice.

He decided to enter the NFL draft. Explaining his decision, Tua spoke about the profound influence of his parents, a reflection of his Samoan heritage where family guidance is paramount. He also articulated a pragmatic view: even with a potential future injury, securing a professional salary would benefit not just himself but also those who supported him. It was a mature perspective, demonstrating a readiness to embrace the next chapter, regardless of the team that called his name.

Interestingly, when asked about his ideal NFL destination, Tua didn't shy away from naming the Dallas Cowboys, the team he grew up cheering for. He was quick to clarify, though, that his intention wasn't to displace their current quarterback, Dak Prescott. Instead, he expressed a desire to learn, to be part of a team, and simply to get back on the field and compete. This desire to play, to contribute, and to grow under experienced guidance speaks volumes about his character.

His journey also highlights the interconnectedness of the football world. We've seen him share a unique bond with fellow Hawaiian and former NFL star Marcus Mariota, who mentored him in high school. This kind of mentorship, passing down wisdom and experience, is invaluable.

More recently, Tua has been navigating discussions surrounding potential interest in Tom Brady by his team, the Miami Dolphins. He's handled these conversations with a grounded approach, emphasizing his presence as the team's quarterback and dismissing the surrounding noise. He's focused on his role, on the team's current situation, and on the support he feels. It’s a testament to his ability to stay centered amidst external pressures.

Ultimately, Tua Tagovailoa's story is one of talent, resilience, and a clear vision for his future. From the highs of championship victories to the lows of serious injury, and now navigating the complexities of the NFL, he continues to approach his career with a blend of ambition and humility. It’s a journey that continues to unfold, and one that many are watching with keen interest.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-27 04:58:51.042500

The Patriots rallied in a low-scoring affair with Denver to kick off championship Sunday, defeating the Jarrett Stidham-led Broncos 10-7. Denver was without Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the team’s overtime win over the Bills in the divisional round, while a snowy and windy second half rendered offensive production on either side ineffective. MVP candidate and second-year quarterback Drake Maye cleaned up the turnovers, which have plagued him as of late, leading New England to advance to Super Bowl 60 in Mike Vrabel’s first year as the team’s head coach with just 86 total passing yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions.

The NFC championship offered NFL fans seeking offense a bit more joie de vivre, as the Los Angeles Rams and Seahawks combined for 879 yards of offense. Seattle defeated LA 31-27, despite a strong performance from Matthew Stafford, who finished the day with 374 passing yards, 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions, taking just a single sack on the day for a nine-yard loss. Sam Darnold posted an equally impressive stat line of 346 yards, 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions after having struggled against the Rams over two games in the regular season (two touchdowns, six interceptions).

LA’s hopes of another Super Bowl under head coach Sean McVay were nearly realized with a third-quarter taunting penalty against Seahawks cornerback Riq Woolen to set up a Rams touchdown that kept it close. However, late in the fourth quarter, the Seahawks managed a fourth-down stop at the goal line, which had the potential to give the Rams a late lead. That play — which McVay later called a “fortuitous bust” in his post-game presser — all but sealed the deal on Seattle’s trip to Santa Clara.

Meanwhile, the head coaching searches for the Las Vegas Raiders, Buffalo Bills, Cleveland Browns and Arizona Cardinals continue this week, with those teams now able to pursue additional interviews with candidates from the staff of the Broncos and Los Angeles Rams, now that they’ve been eliminated from postseason contention.

Almost two weeks after suffering a season-ending Achilles injury, Kittle was back out on the golf course -- albeit with a few creative adjustments.

Kittle tore his right Achilles tendon during the NFL Wild Card Game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Jan. 11 and underwent surgery three days later, on Jan. 14. He shared a video to Instagram on Friday of himself back on the golf course. While still unable to put weight on his foot, Kittle joined 49ers teammates Brock Purdy, Trent Williams and Kyle Juszczyk, and found a workaround that allowed him to participate.

The 32-year-old tight end remained seated in his golf cart while using a device from Power2Golf, a $1,500 attachment that allows golfers to hit shots without swinging. The setup allowed Kittle to launch long-range shots from the cart.

After the 49ers’ win over the Eagles, San Francisco moved forward without Kittle and later suffered a 41-6 blowout loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFL Divisional Round.

Injuries were a recurring storyline for Kittle this season. He missed five games earlier in the year with a Grade 3 hamstring strain, sat out another contest in December due to a left ankle sprain, and also dealt with a recurring thigh injury that sidelined him in Weeks 3 and 11.

It also helps that there’s a two-week gap between the conference title games and the Super Bowl on Feb. 8, which provides an opportunity for some extra rest.

During his Monday afternoon press conference, Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said the team will take Tuesday and Wednesday off before returning to the practice field Thursday. Macdonald said the team then plans to fly to the Bay Area on Sunday, which gives them a full week in California ahead of Super Bowl 60 against the New England Patriots in Santa Clara.

Below is a recap of what Macdonald said when asked about the injury statuses of a handful of players.

• Macdonald said starting linebacker Drake Thomas is doing “good” after exiting the NFC title game with a shoulder injury in the second half, but that he doesn’t know what his practice availability will look like this week.

• Macdonald said the team is hopeful that rookie fullback Robbie Ouzts can return for the Super Bowl, but that his neck injury needs to “calm down.” Ouzts was inactive for the NFC title game after being listed as questionable on Friday’s injury report.

“It’s gotta calm down, so we can have a better feel for how it’s gonna look,” Macdonald said. “But I’m not sure what his practice status is gonna be this week. I’m not sure.”

• Macdonald said the team is still working through the status of fullback/key special teamer Brady Russell, who exited the NFC title with a hand injury in the second half.

“He’s got a hand right now, so we’ll just kind of work through it on what the timing is and what we need to do,” Macdonald said.

• Macdonald said left tackle Charles Cross is “good” after starting and playing all 67 snaps in the NFC title game. He exited Seattle’s Jan. 17 divisional round game with a foot injury and was sidelined for the first two practices last week before being listed as a full participant in last Friday’s practice.

“To my knowledge, he’s good,” Macdonald said. “He’s just a little sore.”

• When asked about the upcoming practice plan for quarterback Sam Darnold, Macdonald said he’s not sure yet how many reps he’ll take over the next two weeks. Darnold has been playing through an oblique injury that he suffered during a Jan. 15 practice. He was limited during practice last week.

“I don’t know what the trajectory is with how many reps he’s gonna need or how much he’s gonna want to take,” Macdonald said. “I don’t know that yet.”

Her simple social media post, shared during championship weekend, reflected resilience and acceptance as Kansas City missed the playoffs for the first time in years and shifted focus from title runs to recovery and family.

January has rarely looked this quiet for the Mahomes household. For years, this stretch of the NFL calendar meant pressure, playoff noise, and championship stakes. This time, the spotlight landed somewhere unexpected. While the AFC Championship unfolded without Kansas City, Brittany Mahomes made it clear she was already living in the offseason. Instead of a stadium suite or sideline celebration, Brittany chose a gym mirror and a message that spoke louder than words. Her social post, shared during the height of championship weekend, reflected both acceptance and resolve. It was a subtle signal that the chapter had turned, even if the hunger to return has not faded.

Brittany Mahomes embraces reset as Chiefs era pauses

Brittany Mahomes posted a workout selfie during the AFC Championship game with a caption that caught fans’ attention. “Vibing to this song every day for forever,” she wrote, pairing it with Ella Langley’s “Choosin' Texas.” The song choice nodded to shared roots with her husband, Patrick Mahomes, and hinted at grounding rather than disappointment. For seven straight seasons, the Kansas City Chiefs owned a place in the AFC Championship conversation. That run ended abruptly this year after Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers. The injury reshaped everything. Kansas City missed the playoffs, and January became about recovery instead of rivalry. While Brittany focused on fitness and routine, the New England Patriots edged past Denver to reach Super Bowl LX. It was a stark contrast to last postseason, when Brittany celebrated wins alongside global stars and postseason confetti filled the air. Now, the Mahomes family rhythm looks different. Patrick has leaned into rehab while spending time with Brittany and their children, including celebrating daughter Golden’s first birthday. The pause has not dulled ambition. It has sharpened it. Brittany’s post was not about absence. It was about resilience. The Chiefs are out this January, but the message from their most visible supporter was unmistakable. The reset is real, and the return is already on their minds.

David J. Chao isn’t so sure, however…

Chao, who spent nearly two decades working as the official team doctor for the then-San Diego Chargers, has transitioned into the world of sports media and provides instant injury analysis for fans of the NFL, NBA and MLB — and made the argument that Maye suffered an injury on Sunday.

“Drake Maye injured his right throwing shoulder against the Broncos,” Chao wrote on X on Monday, with his post accompanied by a four-minute video explaining his totally unsubstantiated diagnosis. “How severe the injury is, and the exact diagnosis, remains to be determined. Heading into Super Bowl LX, I’m far more concerned about Maye’s shoulder than Sam Darnold’s oblique.”

It’s safe to say that his argument is rather shaky, as is his past. Chao has a history of medical malpractice and was sued on two separate occasions with damages awarded totaling over $6 million, according to The Law Offices of Melinda J. Helbock.

The NFL announced Monday that Wright will participate as an injury replacement for Philadelphia Eagles’ cornerback Quinyon Mitchell. The Pro Bowl game will take place Feb. 3 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, the first time the Pro Bowl has been part of the Super Bowl experience.

Wright will join Bears left guard Joe Thuney, center Drew Dalman and safety Kevin Byard at the games after he originally didn’t earn a Pro Bowl nod. It’s the most Pro Bowlers the Bears will have at the game since 2019, when the team brought four players.

It’s a fitting honor for Wright, who had a career year after he signed a one-year contract with the Bears. Wright earned his first career Pro Bowl honor after he led the NFL with eight takeaways.

He intercepted a career-high five passes, which was tied for second in the NFL behind Byard, and returned one for a touchdown. Wright also forced two fumbles, including a key one while stopping the Philadelphia Eagles’ “tush push” on Black Friday.

I'm just gonna continue to do the best that I can to put this team in positions to win football games.""
In the Week 16 victory against them in Seattle, Darnold had two more.
Darnold's support doesn't just come from his offensive teammates.
After Darnold's four-INT game earlier this season, Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones vociferously defended Darnold, offering some choice words for anyone who was doubting him then.","Neither team scored in the final quarter, with the Seahawks stopping the Rams on fourth-and-4 at the Seattle 6-yard line with just under five minutes remaining. Darnold led the Seahawks on an 11-play drive, draining 4:29 of clock and helping prevent the Rams from mounting a miracle drive late.

Darnold credited the support he's received from up and down the roster as the reason he has been able to thrive with the Seahawks since signing a three-year, $100.5 million deal this past offseason.

""It's great. I feel that support. Not only with their words, but with how everyone treats each other in the building,"" Darnold said. ""I'm happy to be a part of this team, this group and this coaching staff, I'm really happy to be here. I'm happy to be in this position. I'm just gonna continue to do the best that I can to put this team in positions to win football games.""

Darnold's right-hand man all game, as he has been most of the season, was Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who finished the game with 10 catches for 153 yards and Darnold's first TD of the night. The NFL's receiving-yards leader and Darnold have developed a tight bond in their first season together, with each elevating their games.

""The work Sam puts in on and off the field, in the film room, knowing what to expect, knowing how I can get open and get the ball and change the game, honestly I got to give him a lot of credit,"" Smith-Njigba told NFL Network's Stacey Dales. ""I just want to make his job easier and be there for him, be open, get open and make it as easy as possible. It's been a great first year.""

Often doubted, Darnold entered this postseason with the reputation as a journeyman on his fifth team in eight seasons and whose first playoff game ended in a nine-sack loss to the Rams last season. As the guy the Jets and Panthers both dumped unceremoniously. As, at most, the fourth-best quarterback of the 2018 NFL Draft class, with Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson winning MVP awards and Baker Mayfield leading two different franchises to playoff victories.

Now Darnold has a chance to be the first from that QB class to win a Super Bowl. He actually made the game two years ago as the 49ers' backup, but Darnold can win it as Seattle's starter -- and his focus is squarely on his team, not on his QB colleagues around the league.

""It's unbelievable,"" Darnold said. ""Obviously, those are great players, but it's more so (about) the team. Just the hard work that we've put in throughout this season.""

Darnold answered plenty of questions along the way this season in leading the Seattle Seahawks to a 14-3 record and earning the NFC's top seed, even while leading the NFL in turnovers this season.

Six of his interceptions came against the Rams. Darnold threw four interceptions in the Week 11 loss. In the Week 16 victory against them in Seattle, Darnold had two more. On Sunday, zero picks and zero fumbles. Darnold has twice thrown for more yards than he did Sunday in his career, including in a five-TD game against the Falcons. But no game has meant more in Darnold's career than Sunday's win.

Now with two impressive playoff victories under his belt, Darnold has turned in the third-highest passer rating (122.4) in a single postseason prior to the Super Bowl, behind only Matt Ryan in 2016 (132.6) and Patrick Mahomes in 2019 (131.5).

""I tell you what, I'm not a quarterback expert,"" Macdonald joked, ""but that's some high-powered quarterbacking going on in that game by No. 14 for sure.""

Darnold's support doesn't just come from his offensive teammates. After Darnold's four-INT game earlier this season, Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones vociferously defended Darnold, offering some choice words for anyone who was doubting him then. And now?

""Everything that I said, (I) stood on it,"" Jones said. ""Sam's a baller, like I said, man. Doubt Sam if you want to. Sam's gonna show up every time. That's what we've known, and that's why I stood on that night for him, and I'd do it all over again.""

Seahawks defensive lineman Leonard Williams, who labored alongside Darnold in those ugly days with the Jets, had nothing but bouquets for his quarterback, citing Darnold as the paragon for Seattle's ability to overcome adversity.

""His resilience, his poise, his leadership. He's overcome a lot,"" Williams said. ""Still has doubters somehow, and once again, he's proven the doubters wrong.""

Now Darnold is one win away from a career-defining victory. That it will come against the Patriots is no small irony. After all, he's 0-4 against them in his career, all blowouts and during his Jets days, throwing for one TD and nine interceptions.

During a four-INT game against the Patriots in 2019, Darnold was seen on camera that night saying he was ""seeing ghosts."" Asked about that game on Sunday, Darnold quipped: ""I almost forgot about it, so thanks.""

And after his performance in the NFC Championship Game, nearly everyone else has, too.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/jhqfnj67opu1h8n43v74,N,,2026-01-26 19:59:36.133806

After being acquired by the New Orleans Saints in the offseason, Devaughn Vele made a noticeable impact during the 2025 campaign before his season was cut short by a shoulder injury. The 6‑foot‑5 wide receiver totaled 25 receptions for 293 yards and 2 touchdowns, averaging 11.7 yards per catch across 13 games. Vele emerged as a reliable target, especially on third downs, and provided much‑needed size and catch ability in the Saints' passing game. His contributions validated New Orleans' decision to trade draft capital to bring him to the roster, and his progress bodes well for an expanded role in 2026.

BEST GAME OF DEVAUGHN VELE'S 2025 SEASON

Saints wide receivers coach Keith Williams on Vele's versatility and skill set:

He’s more of a fluid mover than I thought he was. So it allows me to coach and expect him to be able to run every route on a route tree. When some guys are not 100% fluid movers, there’s only certain routes that they can excel in. Because they just, athletically, can’t move the way they need to to be elite in every single break, every single movement that it takes, to run every route on a route tree. He, at his height, is able to run every route on a route tree.

Barring something unexpected, the Seattle Seahawks will have Pro Bowl quarterback Sam Darnold ready to go for Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8 against the Patriots.

Darnold, who was listed as questionable ahead of the Seahawks’ NFC Divisional Round contest vs. the San Francisco 49ers but ultimately suited up, has been battling an oblique injury.

Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald gave injury updates on Darnold and other Seahawks players on Monday.

“Macdonald said QB Sam Darnold (oblique) and LT Charles Cross (foot) will be sore after playing through injuries. ‘There’s a couple other things we’re going to work through, but nothing major, to our knowledge,’ he said,” ESPN’s Seahawks reporter, Brady Henderson posted on X.

** -- 2025 playoff teams 12.

The Jaguars will face six teams that made the playoff this season after playing eight playoff teams this season.","Like the recent snow that has has concaved most of us in our homes, the NFL has a tendency to bury promising teams that recently tasted success. That was the case this season for the Washington Commanders, who went from the doorstep of the Super Bowl to having the seventh overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft by virtue of their 5-12 record in 2025.

Washington certainly wasn't hoping for that decline, and neither are the 12 teams whose seasons ended during the this year's postseason in 2026. While no one plans to have a down year, it's inevitable that at least a few teams each season will succumb to injuries, close calls, late-game collapses, etc. For teams like the Bears, it may come down to the ball simply taking a few unfavorable bounces after a season where things largely went their way.

Conversely, there are those teams that -- somehow, someway -- find themselves in the playoffs year after year while keeping their Super Bowl window ajar. Lately, that team in the AFC has been the Bills, while the NFC's 49ers have made the playoffs four out of the last five years.

Which losing playoff teams have the best shot at getting to next year's Super Bowl? See for yourself, as we've ranked each team from worst to first.

** -- 2025 playoff teams

12. Carolina Panthers

2025 Record: 8-9 (1st in NFC South)

2026 opponents: Buccaneers, Falcons, Saints, Lions, **Bears, Ravens, Bengals, **Seahawks, **Broncos, Vikings, **Packers, **Steelers, Browns, **Eagles

One of the NFL's feel-good stories in 2025, it's safe to say that the Panthers will be hard-pressed to have similar success in 2026. For staters, they'll face a significantly tougher schedule next year that includes a half-dozen teams that made the playoffs a year ago.

Carolina's success next year will largely depend on whether or not Bryce Young can take another leap this offseason. The Panthers could aid Young's development by getting him a wideout who can complement Tetairoa McMillan, whose 1,014 receiving yards last season was 620 more than Carolina's next leading receiver, Jalen Coker.

11. Pittsburgh Steelers

2025 Record: 10-7 (1st in AFC North)

2026 opponents: Ravens, Bengals, Browns, Falcons, **Panthers, **Broncos, **Texans, Colts, **Jaguars, **Patriots, Saints, **Eagles, Buccaneers, Titans

The Steelers never had a losing season under Mike Tomlin, but that might change under new head coach Mike McCarthy. By virtue of winning the AFC North, the Steelers will face six teams that made the playoffs in 2025. They'll also face two of the NFL's hottest teams at the end of the 2025 regular season in Atlanta and New Orleans.

Once again, quarterback will be Pittsburgh's biggest question mark heading into the offseason. If Aaron Rodgers comes back, that'll give the Steelers a puncher's chance at making the playoffs. But even in that scenario, it doesn't look very promising for Pittsburgh as the North (assuming Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow are healthy) should be a much tougher division in 2026.

10. Green Bay Packers

2025 record: 9-7-1 (2nd in NFC North)

2026 opponents: **Bears, Lions, Vikings, Falcons, **Bills, **Panthers, Dolphins, **Texans, Cowboys, **Patriots, Saints, Jets, Buccaneers, **Rams

Like Pittsburgh, Green Bay will have to face two emerging teams in Atlanta and New Orleans. Their 2026 schedule also includes games against six playoff teams.

While they did make the playoffs, 2025 was a disappointing season for the Packers that led to questions about Matt LaFleur's future before he was given a contract extension. Green Bay started 9-3-1 before Micah Parsons' season-ending injury sent the season in a tailspin. The Packers then lost defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley and have replaced him with former Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon.

9. Houston Texans

2025 record: 12-5 (2nd AFC South)

2026 opponents: Colts, **Jaguars, Titans, Ravens, Bengals, **Bills, Cowboys, Giants, Browns, **Steelers, **Chargers, **Eagles, Commanders, **Packers

After an 0-3 start, the Texans rallied to finish the regular season with a 12-5 record. They then crushed the Steelers in the playoffs -- the franchise's first road playoff win -- before running out of steam against the Patriots in the divisional round.

The Texans' defense was elite last season, but C.J. Stroud's struggles in the playoffs led to Houston's season ending in the divisional round for a third straight year. It's very possible that the Texans will miss the playoffs altogether in 2026 unless Houston gets more consistent play from Stroud.

8. Los Angeles Chargers

2025 record: 11-6 (2nd in AFC West)

2026 opponents: **Broncos, Chiefs, Raiders, **Bills, Dolphins, Ravens, **Seahawks, **Rams, Buccaneers, Browns, **Packers, Vikings, **Steelers

After a 3-0 start, injuries started to take their toll on the Chargers, who ended the 2025 season with three straight losses that dropped their record against fellow playoff foes to 3-3.

The Chargers have replaced Greg Roman with Mike McDaniel, who will be Justin Herbert's fifth different offensive coordinator since the Chargers drafted him in 2020. McDaniel will now be tasked with helping Herbert win his first playoff game.

7. Chicago Bears

2025 record: 11-6 (1st in NFC North)

2026 opponents: Lions, **Packers, Vikings, Buccaneers, **Eagles, **Jaguars, Jets, **Patriots, Saints, **Bills, Dolphins, Falcons, **Panthers, **Seahawks

There are several reasons why Bears fans might need to brace themselves for a letdown in 2026, starting with the fact that their team will face a whopping seven teams that made the playoffs a year ago.

Chicago won eight one-possession games in 2025 that was largely the byproduct of Caleb Williams' uncanny play in the clutch and a defense that led the league in turnovers forced. Those strengths largely overshadowed Williams dreadful 58.1% completion percentage Chicago's defense finishing 23rd in the league in points allowed.

In 2026, the Bears will need more consistent play from Williams and better overall play from their defense if they are going to avoid becoming next year's version of this year's Washington Commanders.

6. Jacksonville Jaguars

2025 record: 13-4 (1st in AFC South)

2026 opponents: **Texans, Colts, Titans, Browns, **Steelers, **Eagles, Commanders, **Patriots, Ravens, Bengals, Cowboys, Giants, **Bears, **Broncos

Jacksonville is one of the few playoff teams that on paper will have an easier schedule in 2026. The Jaguars will face six teams that made the playoff this season after playing eight playoff teams this season.

A big challenge for the Jaguars will be the sheer fact that Liam Coen and his team won't sneak up on anyone after being one of the NFL's biggest surprises this year. The Jaguars would help their cause this offseason by bolstering a defense that was just 21st in the league against the pass and 27th in sacks.

5. Buffalo Bills

2025 record: 12-5 (2nd in AFC East)

2026 opponents: Dolphins, **Patriots, Jets, Chiefs, **Chargers, **Bears, Lions, Ravens, **Broncos, **Packers, Raiders, Vikings, **Texans, **Rams

Before Bills Mafia floods my inbox, I'd like to mention that I think Buffalo will can make a Super Bowl run in 2026. It's just anything but a sure thing.

Buffalo will have a new coach after the surprising firing of Sean McDermott despite his glittering record that includes a 72-27 mark since 2020. Adding to odds of Buffalo missing the playoffs for the first time since 2018 is the fact that it will face seven teams that made the playoffs this year and will also face two teams (the Vikings and Lions) that went 9-8.

As the Chiefs experienced this season with Patrick Mahomes, all it takes is an injury to a franchise quarterback for your season go off the rails. It goes without saying that an injury to Josh Allen would be catastrophic for a Bills team that puts a lot on his plate.

4. Philadelphia Eagles

2025 record: 11-6 (1st in NFC East)

2026 opponents: Cowboys, Giants, Commanders, Cardinals, **Panthers, **Bears, **Texans, Colts, **Jaguars, **Rams, **Steelers, **49ers, **Seahawks, Titans

Philadelphia went to the Super Bowl in 2022, had an off year in 2023, and then won its second Super Bowl in 2024. If history repeats itself, the Eagles should bounce back in 2026 after having a down 2025 season that ended with a home playoff loss to the 49ers.

While they have an impressive group of skill players and a defense that finished fifth in scoring in points allowed in 2025, the Eagles will have to have more harmony on offense next season if they are going to overcome a brutal schedule that includes seven teams that made the playoffs in 2025. The Eagles will also more than likely have to deal with a more competitive division.

3. San Francisco 49ers

2025 record: 12-5 (3rd in NFC West)

2026 opponents: Cardinals, **Rams, **Seahawks, **Broncos, **Eagles, Raiders, Commanders, Vikings, Dolphins, Cowboys, Chiefs, **Chargers, Giants, Falcons

The 49ers have a talented roster and one of the league's best coaches in Kyle Shanahan. Health, however, has continued to allude them to the point that the team's brass is going to look into the viral substation conspiracy this offseason in an effort to avoid another injury-riddled season. Health and the fact that they play in one of the NFL's toughest divisions may be the 49ers' two biggest roadblocks in 2026.

2. Denver Broncos

2025 record: 14-3 (1st in AFC West)

2026 opponents: **Chargers, Chiefs, Raiders, **Bills, Dolphins, **Rams, **Seahawks, **Jaguars, **Patriots, **Panthers, Jets, **49ers, Cardinals, **Steelers

No disrespect to the newly-minted AFC champion Patriots, but the Broncos may have been a Bo Nix injury away from getting to big game after coming up just short on Sunday. With Nix, Denver went 15-3 (including the playoffs) while boasting the league's third-ranked scoring defense.

The Broncos have the team to make another deep playoff run, but it's worth noting that they'll face a brutal schedule that includes eight teams that made the playoffs in 2025. The Broncos will need to play well in the regular season if they are going to get back to the playoffs.

Denver would increase its odds this offseason by making some upgrades at its skill positions, specifically at running back given J.K. Dobbins' injury history and R.J. Harvey making a bigger impact at receiver during his rookie season.

1. Los Angeles Rams

2025 record: 12-5 (2nd in NFC West)

2026 opponents: **Seahawks, **49ers, Cardinals, Cowboys, Giants, **Packers, Chiefs, **Chargers, **Bills, **Eagles, Commanders, Buccaneers, Raiders, **Broncos

The Rams came up short in Seattle, but there's a lot of reasons to feel good about next season if you're a Los Angeles fan.

Los Angeles led the NFL in scoring this season, was 10th in points allowed, and has one of the game's best coaches in Sean McVay. The Rams are surely hoping to retain both of their top assistants -- defensive coordinator Chris Shula and offensive coordinator Nate Scheelhaase -- with the Raiders, Bills, Browns and Cardinals still looking for head coaches.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/25/f0313273-346a-47e9-8bcc-af3273a93a2a/thumbnail/1200x675/98c23106163d6933947dd605b3608bec/calebsad.png,N,,2026-01-26 18:01:24.675452

Before any rulings were made, the New England Patriots ran an errant football out of the hands of Jarrett Stidham and into the end zone. But then it was ruled the Denver Broncos QB had thrown incomplete but for intentional grounding.

The refereeing crew wasn't done. Eventually, they changed their ruling, calling it a backward pass, and therefore a fumble.

But the Pats couldn't actually return the ball to the end zone, because a whistle had blown. That makes it an erroneous whistle, and the officials gave New England the ball at the spot of recovery.

A few plays later, the Pats' Drake Maye ran in their only touchdown of the game in an eventual 10-7 win to advance to the Super Bowl.

The Athletic's Mike Sando broke this play down in a column on Monday morning, and he points out that this call may have been entirely wrong:

Officials erred in blowing the whistle on the play, which seemed to help Denver by nullifying an apparent Patriots fumble return for a touchdown. But language in Rule 7, Section 2 Article 1(o), relating to an erroneous whistle while the ball is loose, seems confusing when it says, ""the team last in possession may elect to put the ball in play at the spot where possession was lost, or to replay the down.""

Was New England the last team in possession, or was it Denver?

MORE: Drake Maye, Mike Vrabel make Patriots super again

Essentially, the way that rule reads suggests that it matters greatly when the whistle actually blew, because if it came before the recovery, it implies Denver would get the choice to replay the down.

Maybe the fact that it's a clear and obvious recovery matters elsewhere from the rulebook, as it does with certain replay review situations.

Advertisement

It also still wasn't clear to everyone who analyzed the play afterward that it was even a backward pass to begin with.

It's certainly a call that loomed large and went against the Broncos, a week after the big catch-turned-interception call against the Bills went in Denver's favor.

The ninth-year pro led all linebackers with 36 QB pressures, per PFF.
Campbell finished the regular season with 76 tackles, 11 QB pressures, three passes defensed and a forced fumble.
After returning from injury in Week 10, he allowed just 17 QB pressures.","The old man can still play. In his return to Arizona, the 39-year-old Campbell generated 6.5 sacks, second most on the team, with 28 QB pressures and 43 total tackles. He added two passes defensed and blocked a field-goal try for the 10th time in his illustrious career. Fourteen of those pressures came while he was being double-teamed, the fifth most such pressures in the NFL in 2025. A lot went wrong in Arizona this season, but bringing back the ageless wonder wasn't one of them. Imagine the Cards' defense if Campbell hadn't been on the field for 17 games.

With many observers focusing on the young edge players in Atlanta's reworked defense, it seems Onyemata's play was relatively overlooked. In his third season in ATL, the big man anchored the middle of the defense as a top-10 run defender, earning seven tackles for loss and a career-high 62 tackles; he also added 18 quarterback pressures from his interior position. His 13 run stuffs led the club, with the Falcons allowing a yard more per rush with Onyemata off the field.

Lewis was a clear choice as the unsung hero to single out following the Panthers' turnaround. The sixth-year pro excelled in his second season in Carolina, driving defenders off the ball in the run game. His film is littered with pancakes and opposing linemen being pushed downfield to open holes in the ground game. Lewis also enjoyed his best season as a pass protector, grading in that area of the game as a top-five guard, per Pro Football Focus, which credited him with allowing a single sack and just 13 QB pressures on 553 pass-rush snaps over 16 regular-season games.

In a magical season for the Chicago, most Bears received their just flowers, from a highly-praised offensive line to a turnover-crazed secondary to the young playmakers on defense. Had he played a full season, Booker would have surely garnered more of the spotlight. Thanks to a knee injury, he didn't make his 2025 debut until Week 9 -- but even so, Booker finished third on the Bears' D in both sacks (4.5) and QB pressures (30), generating a 9.9% QB pressure rate over the final 10 regular-season games. In the first seven weeks of the Bears' season, Chicago generated a 28.7% QB pressure rate (27th in the NFL) with 9.1 pressures per game (31st). After Booker entered the lineup, those numbers went to 33.2 % (21st) and 12.5 pressures per game (14th). I'm not suggesting Booker gave the Bears a monster pass rush, but his presence undoubtedly got them closer to respectability. The second-year pro is still rough around the edges, and Chicago must add more QB-chasing oomph, but Booker is on the same trajectory as his upward-trending team.

The Cowboys found a legit third receiver. In his second season, Flournoy generated 475 yards on 40 catches (11.9 yards per catch) with four touchdowns. As a beneficiary of the defensive attention paid to CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens , Flournoy thrived, generating 0.09 EPA per route, 11th-best among all receivers with at least 200 routes run. His 0.45 EPA per target finished second on the Cowboys, behind only Pickens. Assuming Jerry Jones finds a way to retain Pickens, Dallas will enter 2026 with an excellent trio as the team looks to return to prominence.

The veteran linebacker was the glue that held the Lions' defense together for as long as possible. Anzalone finished with 95 tackles, second on the team behind All-Pro Jack Campbell , and nine passes defensed, including one INT. He generated 2.5 sacks with 17 QB pressures on 91 pass rushes for an 18.7% pressure rate. Among Lions defenders with at least 200 coverage snaps, Anzalone’s -0.31 EPA per target was tops. A leader on a defense decimated by injuries, the linebacker helped keep a unit that could have easily been one of the worst in the league above water under first-year coordinator Kelvin Sheppard.

With stars like Micah Parsons and Xavier McKinney garnering plenty of attention, Williams’ solid play likely got lost in the shuffle for most observers. The second-year safety authored an all-around strong campaign, generating three interceptions, five passes defensed and 89 tackles, with four TFLs. Williams’ ability to play multiple spots was utilized heavily by defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley. According to PFF, the safety spent the bulk of his snaps aligned deep (510) but also played in the box (303) and manned the slot at times (135). That skill set allowed the Packers to be much more diverse in their defensive packages.

The former fifth-round pick didn't just fill the void at left by right tackle Rob Havenstein 's absence due to injury -- he improved the Rams' offensive line. In 10 regular-season starts, McClendon allowed 12 pressures and one sack, per PFF, compared to 22 pressures and a sack in seven games from Havenstein. McClendon also helped boost the run-blocking, bulling open holes on the ground and morphing into one of the better road-grading offensive tackles this season. The sledding got a bit tougher in the playoffs (11 pressures and one sack allowed), but still; this was a rare example of a team stumbling into a better situation with an injury fill-in.

Wilson struggled in coverage, but when he was moving forward, oh baby, did he have a massive impact on Brian Flores’ defense. Seemingly every game, Wilson made a splash play, generating 6.5 sacks and 108 tackles, including 17 TFLs. The ninth-year pro led all linebackers with 36 QB pressures, per PFF. His 20 runs stuffs were tied for third-most among all players in 2025, per Next Gen Stats. A free agent this offseason, Wilson should stick with Flores.

Most eyes were on Tyler Shough ’s impressive end to the season, putting the Saints on a path to contention in 2026. But the quarterback wasn’t the only rookie who came on strong. Banks, the Saints' first-round pick, went through some first-year struggles but rounded into form, offering a glimpse of his potential ability to help solve the issues that have persisted along New Orleans' offensive line. While still rough around the edges, the 315-pound left tackle played well to close the season before suffering an ankle injury in Week 18. In the final four weeks, Banks allowed just one sack and proved he can be one of the better run-blocking tackles, grading out as PFF’s No. 5 run blocker at the position from Week 14 on.

One positive from the Giants' otherwise forgettable campaign: The pass protection wasn't a complete disaster this time around. Andrew Thomas ' ability to play in more than a handful of games was a big factor, but Eluemunor also did his part on the right side. While not a great run-blocker, the 31-year-old was steady in the pass game, allowing 19 QB pressures, tied for the eighth-fewest among players with at least 580 pass-blocking snaps, per PFF -- and if we filter by position, that mark tied for the lowest among OTs.

As part of a talented Eagles defense, Campbell flew under the radar as a rookie, but the first-round pick was stellar, outside of a midseason lull during which he was the odd man out in a stacked linebacker rotation. Campbell finished the regular season with 76 tackles, 11 QB pressures, three passes defensed and a forced fumble. With an athletic profile, he excelled in pass defense, finishing as a top-five linebacker in coverage grade, per PFF. Heading into 2026, Vic Fangio should find a way to get Campbell, who played 63 percent of the Eagles’ defensive snaps, on the field more.

With injuries riddling San Francisco's roster, Kyle Shanahan’s offense needed to unearth production from unexpected places. He found it in Tonges. The backup tight end’s regular-season numbers don’t pop off the screen: 34 catches on 46 targets for 293 yards and five touchdowns. That will happen when George Kittle is the top target on the depth chart. But this was a serious uptick in usage for a player who’d caught zero passes in his career after going undrafted in 2022, with much of his production (29 catches, 269 yards, three TDs) coming in games Kittle missed during the regular season. Niners QBs had a 126.4 passer rating when targeting Tonges in 2025, sixth-best among all TEs with at least 40 targets, per NGS. Given that Kittle is questionable to start the 2026 campaign after suffering a torn Achilles, keeping the restricted free agent around seems like a no-brainer for San Francisco.

In Year 2, Barner became a key weapon in the top-seeded Seahawks offense, generating 52 catches for 519 yards and six touchdowns. Barner proved a pivotal outlet for Sam Darnold , particularly in high-leverage situations. Five of the TE’s six touchdowns came in the red zone, and Darnold posted a 137.8 passer rating when targeting Barner inside the 20-yard line, second-best mark of all tight ends with at least 10 targets (behind only Tucker Kraft ), per NGS. Barner generated a 12.9% success rate per route, third-best among tight ends with at least 250 routes run, behind only George Kittle and Trey McBride . And let’s not forget about ""the Barn Yard"" -- the tight end converted 10 of 11 attempts in short-yardage push plays, with one touchdown.

Goedeke’s importance to the Bucs offense was highlighted in the six games he missed. The right tackle didn't allow a sack in 11 games this season. After returning from injury in Week 10, he allowed just 17 QB pressures. Solid across the board, Goedeke proved to be one of the Bucs' most crucial offensive pieces, alongside bookend Pro Bowler Tristan Wirfs . If the right tackle can stay healthy after missing games each of the past two seasons, Tampa’s offense will be more potent in 2026 under new OC Zac Robinson.

The Commanders' offense wasn’t pretty, and the ground game struggled for spells. But while rookie Jacory Croskey-Merritt generated plenty of buzz, Rodriguez proved a stabilizing force when Washington turned to him down the stretch. Of his 500 yards and six TDs on 112 carries, 381 yards and five scores came on 85 attempts in the final seven games. The third-year back’s .03 rush EPA per carry ranked tied for fifth-best among all RBs with at least 100 totes (compared to Croskey-Merritt’s mark of -0.06). Rodrguez earned a 45.5% success rate on carries, with 29 missed tackles forced; he also averaged 3.46 yards after contact forced per carry. He might not profile as an every-down back, but Rodriguez proved valuable in 2025.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/nsy4zqtbuc6zjdmnoz4w,N,,2026-01-26 18:01:40.413935

But expect Legette to be in camp next summer, regardless of whether the Panthers add another receiver or two.","CHARLOTTE, N.C. — We posted the call-out for questions Friday morning as the Carolinas were preparing for Ice Storm-ageddon. But other than some kind words from Glenn L., there was scant mention of milk, bread, salt or generators.

Instead, The Athletic’s readers maintained their focus, didn’t let the elements take them off their game and kept their eyes on the prize: the Carolina Panthers’ plans over the next three months.

A lot can and will change for the Panthers and every other team during the 87-day stretch between Monday and the first night of the 2026 NFL Draft. Which is to say, what seems logical now might be rendered irrelevant by April. Also: more mailbags!

But there are important threads to follow over the course of the offseason, several of which you asked about: Ikem Ekwonu’s knee, Xavier Legette’s future and the Panthers’ ability to build on the franchise’s first playoff berth since the 2017 season.

Let’s get to them before it gets any colder in Charlotte.

A lot of focus on the short-term approach to the tackle position with Ickey’s injury, but there’s also the long-term question with Ickey and Taylor Moton both being under contract for only one more season, and long-term questions arising (Moton entering age-32 season and Ickey’s recovery from injury). Thoughts on a long-term approach? — Brian H.

Moton is actually signed through the 2027 season after his extension last summer, but the point stands: Is it time to start looking further down the road when talking about tackle? And how the Panthers answer that could tell us a lot about whether they think Ekwonu can come back from his patellar tendon surgery at or near his pre-injury level.

The Panthers have invested heavily in the offensive line under Dan Morgan and Dave Canales, signing guards Robert Hunt and Damien Lewis to big contracts in 2024 and extending Moton in August. But Morgan hasn’t taken an offensive lineman in two drafts as a GM, and bringing in a young tackle makes some sense.

That said, the only way I could see Morgan drafting a tackle at 19 would be if the Panthers are convinced Ekwonu won’t be the same player moving forward, and it’s way too early for them to know that. It’s tough to find franchise tackles after the first two rounds, but the Panthers could take one later to develop and serve as a stopgap until Ekwonu is ready.

Although LB and edge seem to be the most talked about possibilities for the pick at 19, do you sense they eye an interior DL that can also rush the passer? (Remember hearing that they liked Mason Graham had he fallen to No. 8.) — Fernando A.

Never say never, but those two positions that Fernando mentioned feel like much bigger priorities than defensive line. In fact, the D-line seems like a place where the Panthers can trim a little fat to create cap space, with A’Shawn Robinson a potential cut as he enters the final year of his contract with a $12.6 million cap number.

And while the Panthers did like Graham, who had just half a sack in 17 starts for the Cleveland Browns, they like their interior rotation, even with Turk Wharton struggling through an injury-plagued season. Derrick Brown, coming off a career-high five sacks, and a healthy Wharton can push the pocket and set up the edge rushers, a group that needs reinforcements.

With all the heat that Keon Coleman caught this season, he played fewer games than Xavier Legette and still put up more yardage and touchdowns. And he’s almost three years younger than Legette. Could the Panthers pull a Matt Millen and draft a third straight first-round receiver this year? — Jeremy F.

I don’t see it. This feels like the year Morgan, the former linebacker, goes defense in the first round. Of course, I had the Panthers drafting Jalon Walker last year in most of my mocks (though I didn’t ignore their interest in Tetairoa McMillan).

Even so, Morgan wants to give Bryce Young another playmaking receiver, specifically a yards-after-catch demon who “can take a 5-yard catch and take it the distance, or make a few guys miss and come up with a big play.”

Looking at the list of free-agent receivers, one name jumps off the board. Seattle Seahawks speedster Rashid Shaheed, whose touchdown on the opening kickoff set the tone for the Seahawks’ divisional-round win vs. San Francisco, would help the Panthers in a couple of areas but won’t come cheap.

I don’t want to say XL was a disappointment but he definitely underperformed. How likely is it that he is still on the roster next year? Could a positional change to TE be possible? — Eli C.

Readers had too much Legette interest to squeeze into one question, so we’re sizing up to XXL. To be clear: That is not to imply that Legette could bulk his way into a three-point stance, à la Kelvin Benjamin’s attempt to make the New York Giants’ roster as a tight end in 2021 after sitting out the previous two seasons.

The Panthers would move on from Legette before making him a tight end, though I’m not sure I’d characterize that scenario as likely, either. Yes, Jalen Coker is a better receiver than Legette and is now the WR2 alongside McMillan. But Coker has yet to get through a full season, and Legette’s size and speed still make him a home-run threat, no matter how unpolished the rest of his game is.

Morgan has a strong track record of getting draft picks for unproductive and/or unhappy receivers, so that possibility can’t be dismissed. But expect Legette to be in camp next summer, regardless of whether the Panthers add another receiver or two.

They could always flip him at the deadline. But at his end-of-season news conference, Canales didn’t sound ready to give up on Legette yet.

“The thing I respect about Xavier through this process is all that’s done is work. All he’s done is continue to try to find ways. How can I help?” Canales said. “He continued to block, continued to be available. He’s returning kicks and just finding ways to do that. He’s made of the right stuff. I have full faith and confidence that Xavier will bounce back and have an excellent year next year.”

How “in” on winning now should Dan Morgan be this coming season? Do they continue to take the confident but measured steps forward, or should they take more risk? — Adam S.

When the Panthers stood pat at the trade deadline, it spoke volumes about how they viewed the 2025 team: A talented squad with a chance to make the playoffs, but not one ready to contend for a Super Bowl, yet.

It was the right read. For as fun as the season was for a fan base desperate for something positive to rally around, the Panthers backed into the playoffs with an 8-9 record and on a two-game losing streak.

Canales has had two seasons to bring in the type of players he wants to build the culture, and Morgan and VP of football operations Brandt Tilis have been judicious with their free-agent dollars. When they were outbid for Milton Williams last March, they pivoted and used that money on several defensive additions.

Now Morgan has to address the pass rush. Would he do so with a big splash like Trey Hendrickson? Maybe. But the Panthers still aren’t one player away.

“We’re not going to be reckless,” Morgan said. “But at the same time, we’re going to bring talent in here. We’re going to make moves that we feel like will help us out in the future.”

On to the speed round, which really is a speed round as I’m trying to get this finished before the ice hits, the power lines fall and I can’t send this mailbag to my editor until February.

How do you see the Panthers doing next year with a first-place schedule, and how much do you think this will factor into expectations from ownership for where the bar is for success next year? — Deirdre C.

I edited Deirdre’s question for brevity’s sake (and in case I need to make another firewood run). While it’s fun to talk about schedules (the NFL has turned the May release into a one-day schedule-palooza), the reality is the first-place piece of it only involves three games. Yes, they’re against three teams that were good in 2025 (Denver, Seattle and Philadelphia). But there’s no guarantee they’ll be good again next year (I’m looking at you, Eagles). The Panthers played a third-place schedule this season, and two of those bronze medalists from ’24 made the playoffs this year — Jacksonville and Green Bay. The third was Dallas, which thinks it’s going to be good every year. I’d guess Deirdre and everyone else would say ending a seven-year playoff drought was worth sweating through three games next year that could be tough.

Do you get the feeling Canales will ever give up offensive play calling? — Jason C.

This was a question in our December mailbag as well, and my answer hasn’t changed: No, unless Dave Tepper tells him to. Play calling is Canales’ thing, and he seems to be getting a better feel for it. I’d like to see him push the ball downfield a little more.

Am I the only one concerned about Jaycee’s concussion numbers? Seems to me we should be. — Todd C.

It’s an important question and something Horn, the Panthers’ coaches and medical staff will monitor closely after he was in the protocol twice in a six-game span. It’s difficult to know how Horn or anyone will recover from head injuries. Not that we needed any reminders about the serious nature of concussions, but Josey Jewell’s situation provided one.

Soup or salad? — Will C.

Typically salad, especially after 18 weeks of press box buffets. But given the forecast, I’m going soup this week. Hope everyone gets through the storm safely and soundly.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/24231440/GettyImages-2247021269-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-26 17:00:40.482684

Robert Spillane, LB, New England Patriots

Will Campbell, T, New England Patriots

Mack Hollins, WR, New England Patriots

Perhaps the biggest injury from Sunday was Robert Spillane. He’s been a key cog in the run defense for New England, and he wears the green dot on his helmet for the defense. That means he’s the player who communicates the plays from the defensive coordinator on the field. Spillane has been dealing with an ankle injury for weeks off and on. The extra week of rest is likely to do him some good, and I would expect him to play in the Super Bowl. Making it through the whole game could be the bigger issue, but we’ll see how the next couple of weeks go.

Mack Hollins and Will Campbell are no longer on the injury report, as both played Sunday. A big point of concern for the Patriots could be Campbell, who has now allowed 12 pressures in his last four games. That’s a lot of pressure allowed from a left tackle. Now, the three teams the Patriots have faced in the playoffs rank first, ninth, and 10th in sacks this season. That’s a stiff test for any tackle but Seattle is eighth in sacks, 12th in adjusted sack rate, and third in pressure rate. The road for Campbell doesn’t get any easier.

Hollins made his presence known in Denver before and during the game. He only had two receptions but one was a big play down the field in the third quarter on a flea flicker. His run blocking is also a big component for New England. He could be an unlikely hero for the team in two weeks.

Sam Darnold, QB, Seattle Seahawks

George Holani, RB, Seattle Seahawks

The talk from Seattle last week was about Sam Darnold. He wasn’t throwing the ball in practice leading up to facing the 49ers due to an oblique injury. Seattle controlled that game from the opening kickoff, so Darnold wasn’t required to do much. Questions still lingered a bit about his injury. He put that to rest against the Rams, making throw after throw for 300+ yards and three touchdowns. Given the stakes and Darnold’s past in big moments, this was his best game as a pro in my eyes. Seattle should have no concerns heading into the Super Bowl.

They also had to be fairly happy with George Holani, who played a role in the backfield without Zach Charbonnet. Holani did next to nothing with his carries (just three for 4 yards) but took three receptions for 27 yards. Notably, he also played on 23 snaps out of the 67 Seattle had. That’s a lot to ask of a player who hasn’t been active since Week 12, but Holani was up to the task. He certainly won’t threaten Kenneth Walker III for much work, but at least Seattle feels comfortable putting him on the field.

I doubt that many would have predicted that the final four teams in the NFL this year would be the Rams, Seahawks, Patriots and Broncos. It should be a great day of football, even if Denver is missing their starting quarterback. Bo Nix fractured his ankle last week, so Jarrett Stidham is forced into duty for the AFC Championship Game. Denver could also hold the key to cash game builds. We’re waiting to see if receivers Troy Franklin and Pat Bryant will play, along with running back J.K. Dobbins. The Broncos play first, so stay tuned to see if anything changes in the cash core on Sunday.

Playing GPP offers far more reward but plenty of risk as well, so some players opt to play cash every week. In this article, we’ll be setting cash cores for both DraftKings and FanDuel. These cores are meant to eat all the yummy chalk we can and play the popular players, even if we think they could potentially fail. Players that get rostered by 80% of the field in cash games don’t hurt you all that bad if you’re in that 80%. Let’s get busy and figure out who we’re playing!

Note – You still want to be tuned into the FTN Discord for any updates. Things can change and all plays for the cores will be put into the NFL Optimizer Sunday afternoon after the inactives are announced.

Quinn spent the past five seasons with the Browns as the team's senior personnel/coaching executive (2022-25) and senior consultant to the club's football operations (2021). While in Cleveland, Quinn worked with coaching and personnel, contributing to all roster and strategic football decisions.

Prior to the Browns, Quinn spent five seasons (2016-20) with the Detroit Lions as the team's executive vice president of football operations and general manager. He oversaw all football operations, including the restructure of the player personnel department, scouting evaluation processes and the overhaul of the organization's scouting and technology systems. He implemented new processes for salary cap management, player contract negotiations and the use of analytics. Quinn also upgraded the player performance and strength and conditioning departments, while also overseeing the renovation of the Lions' Allen Park practice facility.

Quinn's time in Detroit was also highlighted by his Pro-Bowl draft pick in Taylor Decker (2016) and Pro-Bowl and five-time All-Pro center draft pick, Frank Ragnow (2018).

Before Detroit, the Norwood, Mass., native saw historical success as part of the New England Patriots organization for 16 seasons (2000-15). He held numerous titles in the Patriots' player personnel department, including being the director of pro scouting (2012-15) and assistant director of pro personnel (2009-12), in addition to being a national scout (2008), regional scout (2004-07), pro scout (2002-03) and player personnel assistant (2000-01).

Quinn helped construct the Patriots' dynasty, with the team earning four Super Bowl titles, six AFC Championships, 13 AFC East titles and recorded 10 seasons with 12-or-more wins and 14 seasons with 10-or-more wins during his 16-year tenure.

Entering his 27th year in the NFL, Quinn's reputation and experience in the league led him to be named to the NFL's College Relations Committee by the commissioner in 2019. In this role, Quinn worked with NFL executives to improve relationships between league executives and college football personnel and administrators to improve the NFL Draft process.

Before joining the league, Quinn was a graduate assistant in the athletic department at the University of Connecticut (1998-99), where he earned his master's degree in sports management in 2000 and completed his undergraduate studies in 1998.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/falcons/eeeakdt6zrbp2qmdyo36,N,,2026-01-26 17:00:46.498595

He arrives in Atlanta with 17 seasons of experience in the NFL and 10 seasons of experience at the collegiate level. Last season, he was with the Miami Dolphins as special teams coordinator after serving as the assistant special teams coach for the Los Angeles Rams in 2024. Prior to the Rams, Aukerman spent seven seasons (2017-23) with the Tennessee Titans, beginning as an assistant special teams coach in 2017, prior to being promoted to special teams coordinator in 2018 and adding the title of assistant head coach in 2023. He spent four seasons with the Los Angeles Chargers, serving as assistant special teams coach (2013-15) and special teams coordinator in 2016. Prior to his time with the Chargers, Aukerman spent two seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars as a defensive assistant (2011) and assistant special teams coach (2012) after starting his NFL coaching career with the Denver Broncos as a defensive assistant (2010).

In 2025, Aukerman guided kicker Riley Patterson to the highest field goal percentage of his career (93.1%), which finished fourth in the league. In addition, Aukerman mentored punter Jake Bailey to the second-highest net yard per punt percentage of his career (42.6), which also finished as the top single-season mark in franchise history. Bailey's six punts downed within the five-yard line also finished as the second highest in 2025. Miami tied for the league lead with two blocked field goals, was seventh in punt return average (13.3 yards per return) and 11th in kick return average (26.4 yards per return) while Malik Washington was ninth in the league in kick return average with an average of 26.8 yards per return and returned one punt for a touchdown.

Aukerman spent seven seasons (2017-23) with the Tennessee Titans, where he began as an assistant special teams coach. He was promoted to special teams coordinator in 2018 and assistant head coach/special teams coordinator in 2023. Throughout his tenure with Tennessee, Aukerman helped the Titans reach the postseason in four of seven seasons, winning two AFC South division titles, advancing to the AFC Championship in 2019 and securing the No. 1 seed in the AFC in 2021.

From 2022-23, Aukerman mentored punter Ryan Stonehouse, who led the league and set an NFL record with a 53.1 gross punting average as part of his 2022 rookie campaign. Following the 2022 season, Stonehouse was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team and second-team All-Pro. He finished fourth in the NFL that season and set a rookie record with a 44.0-yard net average.

He coached two Pro Bowl players in punter Brett Kern (2017-19) and long snapper Morgan Cox (2022). Kern led the NFL in both net punting average (44.6) and gross punting average (49.7) in 2017. His 44.6-yard net punting average ranked second in NFL history at the time. He also led the league with 52.7 percent of his punts (39 of 74) placed inside the 20 in 2018 and in 2019 led the NFL in punts inside the 20 (37). Kern led the league again in 2020 with 59.5 percent of his punts (22 of 37) inside the 20 and had the league's third-best ratio of punts inside the 20 to touchbacks (18:1) in 2021.

Between 2017-21, the Titans ranked 10th in punt return average (8.8 yards per return) and had the fifth-fewest special teams penalties in the NFL (67). Kern ranked second in the NFL with a 42.5-yard net punting average in that period.

In 2018, Aukerman's first season as the Titans' special teams coordinator, the team set a new NFL record for kickoff return average (32.0), becoming the first team in NFL history to average more than 30.0 yards per kickoff return in a season.

Prior to joining the Titans, Aukerman spent four seasons (2013-16) with the San Diego Chargers as an assistant special teams coach (2013-15) and special teams coordinator (2016).

Aukerman's first coaching role in the league came in 2010 as a defensive assistant for the Denver Broncos. He then joined the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2011 in the same capacity before transitioning to special teams with Jacksonville in 2012 as an assistant special teams coach.

Prior to the NFL, Aukerman spent 10 years coaching at the collegiate level. He served as the linebackers coach at Kent State during the 2009 season. He had two stints at Miami of Ohio, as linebackers coach and co-special teams coordinator from 2005-08 and previously as a graduate assistant from 2001-02. Aukerman also spent two seasons as the linebackers coach and special teams coordinator at Western Kentucky (2003-04).

His first coaching role was at his alma mater, the University of Findlay, as the wide receivers coach in 2000. Aukerman played defensive back and wide receiver for the Findlay Oilers from 1995-98 and was a member of both the 1995 and 1997 NAIA National Championship teams. He was a two-time NAIA All-American in 1997-98 and also earned first-team All-GLIAC defensive honors in 1998. Aukerman was a dual-sport athlete and played baseball in his junior year.

In 2021, Aukerman founded the Aukerman Family Foundation, which is dedicated to positively impacting local youth by providing scholarships to college-bound students and sponsoring programs that strengthen family relationships through sports.

As the NFL season reaches its final chapter, only two teams remain standing with Super Bowl Sunday set for February 8th. Below is a breakdown of the key injuries from the Conference Championship games, along with what they could mean for both the Patriots and Seahawks as they prepare for the biggest stage of the season.

Key: Position Player, Team | Injury | Projected Return to Play

WR Pat Bryant, Denver | Hamstring | Ready Next Season

After battling back from a concussion, Pat Bryant suffered an additional setback Sunday afternoon with a hamstring injury. Although he was initially listed as questionable to return, Bryant did not re-enter the game.

With an extra week of rest, my guess is that he would have played in the Super Bowl had the Broncos advanced, though his role may have been limited or more of a decoy. The rookie wide receiver had an up-and-down 2025 season but showed flashes of his upside. He will look to build on his success next year.

RB J.K. Dobbins, Denver | Lisfranc/Foot | Ready Next Season

Denver opened the 21-day practice window for J.K. Dobbins earlier last week, but he was ultimately ruled out for the Conference Championship. Similar to Pat Bryant (above), this projection is speculative given the Broncos' elimination, though it appeared Denver was preparing to have Dobbins available for the Super Bowl. Dobbins' career has been plagued by injuries, yet he has consistently battled back. He will have a full offseason to address his foot injury, and I suspect he will be part of a team's backfield in 2026.

Snow games aren’t fair, the critics protest.
Advertisement The bad news for snow football fans, though, is that the league is slowly, collectively filtering the random weather element out of the game.
There’s still a slight hope for generational snow games in the seasons to come.
Now, if Buffalo can just manage to claim some more home playoff games …","There are two kinds of football fans in this world: Those who watched Sunday’s AFC championship and loved the dramatic, season-changing effect that the elements had on the game … and those who should just sim the season on Madden.

Just two words — “snow game” — make every football game better, and Sunday’s game approached snowy, icy perfection. Like settlers trapped on a snowy mountain pass, Drake Maye and the Patriots outlasted Jarrett Stidham and the Broncos in Denver (though, presumably, the survivors did not eat the losers). The still photos from the game are gorgeous, a stunning tableau of swirling snow and desperation as both teams suddenly realized they were facing a third, far superior challenger.

Advertisement

Now, the actual gameplay itself? That was terrible. Both teams had already struggled to move the ball against far superior defenses. Throw in the elements that began to impact things in the third quarter, and this wasn’t even a fair fight. Watching some of the finest athletes in the world picking their way delicately through the snow like they were trying to avoid stepping on dandelions, or rumbling on the ground like five-year-olds who had just wrecked off a sled … well, that’s not exactly aesthetically pleasing football. Certainly not ideal conditions for the second-most-important game of the year.

Snow games aren’t fair, the critics protest. You shouldn’t work an entire season, August to January, only to see all your planning, all your effort, all your strategy and scheming blown away in 12 minutes of snowy hell.

You know what? That’s right! It shouldn’t go down that way! In a perfect world, every football game would be the best 11 on the best 11, everyone healthy, everyone on the field in perfect climate, everyone with the maximum opportunity to perform at the absolute pinnacle of their ability.

But the underlying fundamental principle of sports is the ability to compete when conditions aren’t ideal. It’s the old Mike Tyson chestnut — “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face” — played out in 12-degree temperatures. If sports are a reflection of life, well, what’s more life-like than months of planning for a big moment abruptly undone by terrible weather? Sure, it’d be wonderful if every family vacation or child’s birthday party went off under pristine skies, but we know that so often doesn’t happen.

Advertisement

(Aside: Do not feel bad for anybody who gambled on this game and lost money because of the snow. That’s why it’s called gambling, not investing. Gamblers hope for perfect conditions; sports books know that perfection is unattainable and profit off that knowledge.)

Another fundamental element of sports: It’s not just how you act, it’s how you react. When the unthinkable or the unexpected becomes your new reality — when that thunderstorm starts dumping buckets on your meticulously orchestrated outdoor wedding, say — what do you do then? Do you curse the heavens, or do you adapt?

The anticipate-and-adapt element is a key reason why Sean Payton is drawing so much criticism for opting to go for it on fourth down midway through the second quarter. The wisdom of going for a crucial fourth down with an inexperienced quarterback aside, Payton knew, or should have known, that rough weather was on the way. NASCAR crew chiefs scheme this way all the time, getting their drivers up front on the chance that weather will call the race early. There was no chance the NFL was going to call this game on account of snow, but a two-possession lead with snow on the way is a nice hand to hold.

There’s a larger point to be made here about the real versus the ideal, and the way that we are collectively doing our very best to eliminate all random chance from these games. We engineer our newest stadiums to replicate the natural world with a perfect scientifically engineered grass-like product and perfect mechanically generated air temperature, yes. But that’s not what makes these games worth watching. If all we are after is perfection, we’d sim the season with AI. The unpredictable element — whether it’s a sudden snow or, say, a player nearly taunting his team out of the playoffs — is why we come back to sports, season after season.

Advertisement

The bad news for snow football fans, though, is that the league is slowly, collectively filtering the random weather element out of the game. This isn’t surprising; when you drop $5 billion on a new stadium, you don’t want a pesky element like weather determining whether it’s comfortable.

There are currently 21 NFL teams that play in open-air stadiums, and excluding the obvious never-snow ones — Tampa Bay and Miami — at least half a dozen of the still-remaining open-air teams are planning some form of roof or canopy overhead in the years to come. Planned or in-progress stadiums and renovations in Nashville, Jacksonville, Cleveland, Chicago, Kansas City and Washington, D.C. would be domed or covered.

The most recent new stadium built open to the air is, coincidentally enough, Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, which opened in 2014 and has the benefit of being in, well, California. Of all the new stadiums on the way, only Buffalo’s stadium will be open to the air … and the irony in that, given Buffalo’s tendency for epic snow, is perfect. There’s still a slight hope for generational snow games in the seasons to come.

Their inability to run the football effectively came back to bite them in the AFC Championship, where they averaged just 3.3 yards per rush as a team.","The Denver Broncos' season ended just short of reaching Super Bowl LX after falling to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship. This was the latest gut punch for a franchise that limped into this conference title matchup. The high of winning a divisional round thriller against the Buffalo Bills in overtime was almost instantly shattered once word got out that Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury. That thrust backup Jarrett Stidham into the limelight, and while the veteran had his moments, he couldn't get his team to pull off what would've been a miraculous upset.

Now, Sean Payton's club is looking into the abyss of the offseason and on the precipice of doing a postmortem of the 2025 season. By most accounts, it was a wildly successful campaign, owning a 14-3 record over the regular season, which was good enough for an NFC West title and the No. 1 seed. As they look to begin preparing for the 2026 season, let's highlight what's on the horizon for the organization.

Bo Nix's recovery takes center stage

Nix suffered a broken right ankle in the final moments of that overtime win against the Bills. The second-year quarterback has already undergone surgery to repair the ankle, with the procedure done this week. The early prognosis was that Nix is expected to be sidelined for 12 weeks. If he stays on that recovery timeline, Nix should only miss a small amount of OTAs (if any) and certainly be on track to participate during mandatory minicamp later this spring. That gives Nix plenty of time to get into form before Denver opens up training camp, so this injury is not debilitating enough that it'll bleed into 2026.

Does the coaching staff lose key figures?

Payton has been able to bring the Broncos back to relevance, but that success may soon result in key figures on his coaching staff being poached. With Denver now eliminated, teams looking for a head coach can now hold in-person interviews with Broncos staffers, including defensive coordinator Vance Joseph and offensive pass game coordinator Davis Webb. Both Joseph and Webb have been popular candidates this hiring cycle, and it would not be shocking to see one or both coaches depart in short order.

Webb has interest from the Las Vegas Raiders and Buffalo Bills, and neither of those destinations has filled their vacancy to this point. Webb also interviewed with the Baltimore Ravens, but the franchise recently hired former Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter. While Payton calls the offensive plays, having someone of Webb's acumen departing is hardly ideal for a still-developing offense under Nix.

As for Joseph, he has been requested by a large contingent of teams. While some of those organizations have since filled their roles, the Raiders and Arizona Cardinals are two clubs that have expressed interest in Joseph and are still on the hunt for a new coach.

Joseph's potential exit could prove to be the biggest X factor of Denver's offseason. A big piece as to why the Broncos made it to the AFC Championship was due to Joseph orchestrating arguably the best defense in the NFL. Denver was fourth in the NFL in scoring and first in the NFL in sacks (including postseason). If Joseph leaves, there's the risk that the unit takes a slight step back.

Bolstering offense around Nix

A couple of the areas the Broncos should look to address this offseason come on the offensive side of the ball. Specifically, they need to continue surrounding Nix with talent at the skill positions. This season, the Broncos ranked 28th in the NFL in yards per reception from the wide receiver and tight end positions combined. Courtland Sutton was able to lead the team with 1,017 yards receiving, but Denver did struggle to find a top secondary pass-catching option, volleying from Troy Franklin to Pat Bryant to Marvin Mims at receiver. They also never truly got Evan Engram off the ground as Payton's ""Joker"" at the tight end spot.

Moreover, Denver need to bolster the backfield. The rushing attack cratered after J.K. Dobbins went down with a foot injury in Week 10. Rookie RJ Harvey averaged just 3.7 yards per carry on the year. Their inability to run the football effectively came back to bite them in the AFC Championship, where they averaged just 3.3 yards per rush as a team. With a backup quarterback under center and snowy conditions late in the contest, a capable ground attack could've helped them pull off the upset. Instead, that deficiency helped be their undoing. With Dobbins looking at free agency this offseason, along with a shaky injury history, Denver would be wise to add a back in some capacity this offseason.

Travis Hunter's return from a season-ending knee injury and how the Jaguars eventually settle on using him next season is one of the biggest offseason storylines.

At his season-ending news conference, general manager James Gladstone said Hunter would be be a two-way player again in 2026. Whether he'll be a cornerback first and then a receiver -- as Gladstone hinted -- or a receiver first and then a cornerback remains to be seen.

Hunter finished his rookie season as more of a receiver than corner. He played 67% of the team's offensive snaps and 36% of the defensive snaps -- mainly coming in when the Jaguars were in nickel -- before the non-contact knee injury he suffered in practice on Oct. 30 required season-ending surgery.

But Gladstone indicated that it would be the reverse in 2026.

""Obviously you can take a peak at expiring contracts on our roster and see which side of the ball has more,"" he said ""At this point walking into the offseason, corner is a position that we have a few guys who are on expiring contracts. By default, you can expect there to be a higher emphasis on his placement [at corner].""

The Jaguars have three cornerbacks on expiring contracts: Greg Newsome II, Montaric Brown and Christian Braswell. Brown started 12 games and Newsome, whom the Jaguars acquired via trade in early October, started 11. There are two receivers whose contracts are expiring: Dyami Brown and Tim Patrick. They combined to catch 35 passes.

Hunter could start at one corner with Jourdan Lewis at the other, and in nickel situations Lewis could slide inside and Jarrian Jones would play outside, or Lewis could remain outside and Jones plays nickel.

Either way, early indications are that Hunter is primarily going to be a cornerback and have a package of plays on offense. What Gladstone does when free agency arrives will help clarify what the Jaguars will do with their two-way threat.

Here are four other major storylines for the Jaguars' 2026 offseason:

What happens with free agent RB Travis Etienne Jr. and LB Devin Lloyd?

Could either, or both, be back in 2026?

Etienne is coming off his third 1,000-yard rushing season (1,107) and posted 13 total touchdowns. He turned out to be a very good fit in coach Liam Coen's offense, improved as a pass blocker, and was the team's most consistent offensive player. He has 3,798 yards rushing in four seasons, which puts him third on the franchise's all-time list, and his 5,136 yards from scrimmage ranks fifth.

The estimated franchise tag for a running back in 2026 per OverTheCap.com would be $14.153 million, which would make Etienne the fourth-highest-paid running back in terms of annual salary. That would be nearly $3 million more than James Cook III ($11.5 million), who led the NFL in rushing in 2025.

Using the tag seems unlikely, especially since the Jaguars drafted Bhayshul Tuten and LeQuint Allen Jr. in 2025 with an eye toward replacing Etienne in 2026. Both made modest contributions as rookies: Tuten ran for 307 yards and averaged 3.7 yards per carry and Allen was used mainly as a pass protector and third-down back.

But Etienne said he wasn't ruling out coming back.

""When I got drafted here, I wanted to be one of the best running backs to ever put on a jersey,"" he said. ""I wanted to be remembered like the guys, Fred Taylor, Maurice Jones-Drew. You want to set that standard. You want to leave a legacy.""

Lloyd's situation is different. He was the No. 27 pick in 2022 -- the Jaguars traded back into the first round to select him -- and was named the NFL's Defensive Rookie of the Month in September 2022. But he has had an up-and-down career since then.

He started every game he played in 2023 and 2024 and had more than 100 tackles in each season but often had issues in coverage and got caught out of position in run defense, and as a result the team opted to not pick up his fifth-year option last spring.

Lloyd responded with the best season of his career: five interceptions, one fumble recovery, 10 quarterback hits and second-team All-Pro honors.

The estimated franchise tag for linebackers, per OverTheCap.com, is $27.45 million. That's a high number to spend on a linebacker who doesn't pass rush and the Jaguars are unlikely to use the tag, so Lloyd will be a free agent.

In November, ESPN ranked Lloyd as the 23rd-best impending free agent. The only linebackers higher on the list were Quay Walker, who is coming off his rookie contract, and Khalil Mack, who turns 35 in February.

Lloyd talked around the question of whether he wanted to return.

""I just want to be where God wants me to be,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, that's where I want to be and I'm waiting on that answer from him. Like I said, I haven't put any thought into it. Everything's been about trying to be the best player I can be for this team this year. And ultimately, I want to be where God wants me to be.""

A new contract for Travon Walker?

As of now, Walker will be playing the 2026 season under his fifth-year option. And though there are no indications the team will be working on a contract extension soon, it sounds as if the Jaguars do want him around long term.

Walker played through a broken left hand and a right knee injury in 2025 and finished with 3.5 sacks (the fewest since his rookie season), 38 tackles and 13 QB hits in 14 games. The No. 1 pick in 2022 now has 27.5 sacks and 57 QB hits in four seasons.

Though Walker hasn't become the dominant pass rusher the previous regime hoped for, he has been a powerful edge setter and is very good against the run. Gladstone was effusive in his praise of Walker's work ethic, attitude and willingness to play through injuries.

""The thing that I really appreciate in watching Travon move is how much he loves this place, how much he loves his teammates,"" Gladstone said. ""That just seeps out of his soul. Those are the type of people you want to align yourself with. It's the type of players that we want to make sure that are still in our building moving forward.""

So what could a potential extension look like? It would be surprising if it were anywhere close to what Detroit gave Aidan Hutchinson, who was selected one spot after Walker: four years, $180 million, $141 million guaranteed. His $45 million annual salary is second only to Green Bay's Micah Parsons ($46.5 million) among pass rushers.

Hutchison has been a much better pass rusher than Walker: Hutchinson has 43 sacks (tied for seventh most in NFL since 2022) while playing in seven fewer games.

A better comparison could be the extension that teammate Josh Hines-Allen signed in April 2024: five years, $141.25 million with $88 million guaranteed. That's $28.25 million annually, which ranks ninth among edge rushers. Hines-Allen has 40.5 sacks since 2022, including 17.5 in 2023.

""I just play ball and let my agent and people upstairs do what they're going to do,"" Walker said. ""I would love to be here. I wouldn't want to be nowhere else. I love this community. I love the players in this locker room. I love the coaching staff. I love everything about this organization.

""I like the trajectory that we're going and I want to be a part of it. So I'd love to be here forever.""

What do the Jaguars do with WR Brian Thomas Jr.?

ESPN's Bill Barnwell wrote on Thursday that Thomas would draw significant interest if the Jaguars were willing to make him available for a trade despite a significant dip in production in 2025.

Thomas had a rough start to the 2025 season, catching 27 passes for 365 yards and one touchdown, and averaging 13.5 yards per catch with five drops in the Jaguars' first seven games. The Jaguars were using him more in the middle in those first seven games and Thomas wasn't comfortable -- he appeared to shy away from contact several times (including in the end zone against Cincinnati) -- in that role.

The Jaguars then used him differently: more outside the numbers and down the field to stretch the defense and create more openings for Jakobi Meyers, Parker Washington and Brenton Strange in the middle and on intermediate routes.

Thomas was more productive in that role, catching 21 passes for 342 yards and a touchdown, and had only one drop in the final nine games.

He also averaged nearly 3 yards more per catch -- 16.3 -- in that stretch.

But trading him isn't a wild idea. This regime didn't draft him, Washington has emerged as a major part of the offense, Meyers is locked in for at least the next two seasons, and Thomas could draw a first-round pick in return.

However, the Jaguars view Thomas as an integral part of the offense moving forward, with Coen saying he and the coaching staff would ""continue to pour into guys to try to get the most out of then to help our team win as many games as humanly possible and B.T. will 100 percent be a part of that.""

What happens with OL Walker Little?

On Dec. 2, 2024, Little signed a three-year, $40.5 million contract extension (with $25.9 million guaranteed) to be the Jaguars' left tackle. Thirteen months later, Cole Van Lanen signed a three-year, $51 million contract extension (with $32.5 million guaranteed) to be the Jaguars' left tackle.

Van Lanen is clearly Coen and Gladstone's choice to be the starting left tackle going forward.

So where does that leave Little in 2026? Here are some options:

He could be the backup swing tackle, but his base salary of $11 million is fully guaranteed in 2026, which would mean the Jaguars' highest-paid offensive lineman in terms of base salary wouldn't be a starter.

He could compete for a spot at guard. That's where he ended up playing in Weeks 16 and 17 last season, starting in place of injured right guard Patrick Mekari. Mekari, by the way, has the second-highest base salary of any Jaguars offensive lineman in 2026 ($10.5 million).

The Jaguars could trade him. It would cost the team $7.235 million in dead money and save them $7.265 million. But teams know Little is no longer a starter at tackle so that probably would lessen the substance of any offers. The Jaguars do have fourth-round pick Wyatt Milum as a potential swing tackle replacement.

Competing for the spot at guard seems most likely. Coen and offensive line coach Shaun Sarrett want linemen who can play multiple positions, and Little is experienced, with 39 starts at tackle and guard.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0126%2Fr1605719_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 13:02:27.256447

Veteran long snapper Matt Orzech arrived in Green Bay during the same 2023 offseason as Whelan.","GREEN BAY – There aren't many NFL players who can outrun Bo Melton. It's been his signature trait since entering the league in 2022.

That prodigious 4.3 speed made Melton an ideal candidate to serve as a flyer for Daniel Whelan and the Packers' punt unit, one of two perimeter players responsible for applying the initial pressure on the opposing team's returner.

And what a responsibility that turned out to be.

Once Melton started working with Whelan a couple years ago, he noticed an interesting pattern developing. He kept running, the punts kept going and punt returners kept backing up.

""He boots that ball so far,"" said Melton with a laugh. ""Daniel is that guy. He has that boot. Just blessed to be on a team where he can punt that thing and give his guys time to get down there.""

Whelan's combination of natural talent, pure power and an insatiable desire to take his game to another level has positioned him as one of the NFL's top up-and-coming punters.

It also catapulted the 6-foot-5, 219-pound punter to the top of the team's record book after Whelan shattered the Packers' single-season records for both gross (51.7 yards per punt) and net (43.9) punting average.

His gross average ranked No. 1 in the NFL and marked the first time a Green Bay punter has led the league in the category since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger. It was also the third-best single-season mark by a punter with at least 40 punts in NFL history.

Whelan isn't one to publicly bask in the glory of his own success. Even after notching the most decorated season ever by a Packers punter, he'd rather point the credit to Melton or the coverage team than acknowledge his vital part of the process.

""Love that. That's good for the punt team,"" said Whelan after the regular season. ""It's all them.""

It does have plenty to do with Whelan, too. After sifting through six punters over seven years, Green Bay brought in the Irish-born Whelan after a standout 2023 season with the XFL's D.C. Defenders.

Later that summer, Whelan usurped veteran Pat O'Donnell for the Packers' punting job and has only continued to get better during each of his three seasons in Green Bay.

The NFL is starting to take notice. Whelan was the No. 1-graded punter this season, according to Pro Football Focus, and received three first-team votes in AP All-Pro balloting. Green Bay has never had a punter make the All-Pro team.

""He's a great dude, great in the locker room, but he's a real weapon out on the field in terms of being able to flip the field,"" Head Coach Matt LaFleur said. ""I feel like anytime we've gotten in some of those critical moments where we really need a great kick, he's come through for us.""

Green Bay is not an easy NFL city to punt in, especially once the temperatures start to dip in November. The wind patterns can be tricky not only inside Lambeau Field but also at practice.

Whelan has found a way to cut through all of it. Veteran long snapper Matt Orzech arrived in Green Bay during the same 2023 offseason as Whelan. Even now, Orzech is in awe of what his fellow specialist can do.

""Bombs. Honestly,"" said Orzech when asked what he saw from Whelan this past season. ""From the day he showed up, it was immediately obvious that his leg explosion was pretty impressive. I've never seen somebody who hits 5.0-plus (seconds for hang time) punts consistently. Even in crazy wind or cold, there's still going to be a 5.0 on the chart for the day, which is unbelievable. It's crazy.""

Melton and fellow flyer Zayne Anderson often have a good laugh about Whelan's ability to defy the laws of gravity at times and his ability to position the ball.

Whelan made obvious strides in his directional punting in 2025 while still downing 18 punts inside the 20. When the time came to swing away, Whelan could handle it, too. His 32 punts of 50-plus yards ranked fourth in the NFL and were the most by a Packer in a season dating back to 2000.

For good measure, Whelan knocked down one last accolade in the Packers' regular-season finale against Minnesota when he posted a gross average of 53.9 yards and a net average of 50.8 yards on a career-high eight punts.

His net average of 50.8 yards per punt was the second-best mark by an NFL player since 2000 in games with eight-plus punts (Johnny Hekker; Dec. 4, 2016).

Recognition isn't what drives Whelan, though. It's never been his goal to simply break records. He wants to win games and get to a Super Bowl. If his foot helps make that happen, then the 26-year-old punter feels like he's doing his job.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/fwy4pob1hmvkuxhtdpdq,N,,2026-01-26 17:00:53.852704

The Jets failed to record an interception during the 2025 season.","The 2025 season was a bittersweet homecoming for New York native S Andre Cisco.

The five-year veteran -- who was born in Queens, attended high school on Long Island and played college football at Syracuse -- was signed by the Jets in March after spending four seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars.

""I've enjoyed it,"" he said of his return to the area. ""Just coming back to the Northeast, being in the atmosphere of the people and all of those things has been really refreshing for me.""

On the field, however, Cisco did not have the season he envisioned. The former third-round draft selection sustained a season-ending pectoral injury during a Week 8 win over Cincinnati and underwent surgery the following week. Prior to the injury, Cisco had played all but 1 defensive snap, and his 41 tackles were the second most on the team through 8 contests.

Cisco, who mentioned he tries ""to find a spiritual lesson with everything,"" said his time spent on the sidelines was no different.

""I feel like I've matured a lot during these last eight to nine weeks,"" he shared on Jan. 5. ""Just being on the sideline and taking some time. I've never been on IR in-season, so that's the most time I missed. It's very unique, obviously, within that.""

After missing just five contests during four seasons in Jacksonville, Cisco acknowledged the challenge of watching the team's results unfold without being on the field. But despite missing the final 9 games, the 2025 season served as a valuable learning experience for the newcomer.

""I learned a lot about being on a new team and being considered more of a veteran,"" he said. ""Coming here and being a veteran presence taught me a lot. What guys really need from veteran presences; I was trying to be that most of the year.""

Cisco, who is set to become a free agent this offseason, spoke highly of the relationships he built during his first season with the Green & White.

""I really appreciate the year I had here,"" he said. ""Really thankful for AG [HC Aaron Glenn] and Mougey [GM Darren Mougey] and how they do things.""

He added: ""AG was probably the most transparent I've had as a head coach, in terms of just being honest, but also being uplifting and positive. I think the biggest thing is, he knows what he wants his team to look like. He was able to pinpoint those things easily and just continue to enforce it. And I think things will get turned around.""

Part of that turnaround could involve making more plays on the ball. The Jets failed to record an interception during the 2025 season. And Cisco -- who recorded 8 INTs across his four seasons in Jacksonville, including a career-high 4 in 2023 -- said taking the ball away is part of ""the brand that I try to carry.""

""As a group, we've got to make plays on the ball,"" he said. ""We've also just got to continue to limit explosives. It's cookie cutter to say, but it's really true. If you limit explosives, you win games.""

As the Jets focus on these defensive details during the offseason and beyond, Cisco's priority will be on elevating other aspects of his game.

""Maximizing my skill set,"" he said of his goals for the offseason. ""Making plays on the ball has been such a key thing for me that I need to continue to refine other parts of my game, so that I'm available to do everything and every type of job.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/jets/rppcp4a35fh6cqjxbqms,N,,2026-01-26 14:01:33.857740

In Seattle's 31-27 win over the Rams in the NFC championship game, Darnold threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns with no turnovers — the type of performance in a high-stakes game that, given the way he was traded, released and given up on by his four previous teams, few believed Darnold was capable of during his winding, eight-year path through the NFL.

“You can’t talk about the game without talking about our quarterback,” Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said. “He just shut a lot of people up tonight, so I’m really happy for him.”

In the 103rd game of his career, Darnold has now made a Super Bowl before any of the four other quarterbacks drafted in the 2018 first round, including Most Valuable Player winners Josh Allen of the Buffalo Bills and Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens.

Russell Wilson, who as quarterback led Seattle to a Super Bowl win during the 2013 season and an appearance the next, wrote on X late Sunday that ""Darnold's comeback story over the past 2 years has been one of the most inspirational things to watch! Cool seeing him overcome!!!!""

When the Super Bowl begins Feb. 8 in Santa Clara, California, it will feature opponents that undertook lighting-quick rebuilds. New England was 4-13 last season before hiring Mike Vrabel as coach a year ago; Macdonald created what many statistics judged the NFL's best defense in only his second season as head coach.

The quarterback on one sideline has also taken an accelerated path to the NFL's biggest stage. At 23 years old, New England's Drake Maye will become the second-youngest quarterback ever to start a Super Bowl. Maye, the third overall pick in 2024, will be making just his 34th career start.

Six years before Maye was drafted, Darnold was selected third overall, too, by an AFC East also-ran. But to say Darnold's own journey to the Super Bowl, in contrast, was more winding would be an understatement.

“For him to overcome what he had to overcome, I’m rolling with Sam all day,” said Smith-Njigba, who accounted for 153 yards on 10 catches, and a touchdown, Sunday. “We believe in him.”

""I feel that support,"" Darnold said. ""Not with only their words but with how everyone treats each other in the building. There's a lot of respect that goes around the building. Everyone respects the work that we all put into this great game and so I'm just happy to be part of this team, man.""

Many teams had taken chances on Darnold, believing in the potential that was revealed Sunday.

Instead, after 38 games with the woeful Jets, he was traded to Carolina, where Darnold started 17 games before too many losses and injuries contributed to losing a quarterback competition to Baker Mayfield in 2022. The next season, Darnold got an up-close view to a Super Bowl appearance — as a backup in San Francisco. A year later, when Minnesota rookie J.J. McCarthy got hurt in preseason, Darnold stepped in as the starter and with unexpectedly shocking results, and led the Vikings to a 14-3 record.

He looked to be playing his way to a giant contract as a free agent until the Vikings fell apart during their last two games, with Darnold unable to reproduce his strong statistics while under constant pressure. The capper was a blowout loss in the Wild Card round to the Rams, who harassed Darnold into nine sacks.

During free agency, Minnesota judged McCarthy to be its future and moved on. Even Seattle hedged its bets on Darnold. Though the totals in his contract with the Seahawks said three years and $100 million, the fine print reportedly contained a contractual ripcord that the team could pull after just one season.

By throwing for 4,048 yards, a career-high completion percentage and helping Seattle earn the NFC's top seed in the playoffs, Darnold's season suggested his turnaround in Minnesota was no fluke. And yet, it also didn't settle questions about his postseason readiness. In two of the team's most-important games of the year against the Rams, he had thrown for just two touchdowns and six interceptions combined. And his 14 interceptions were the third-most in the NFL.

Even Seattle's 41-6 playoff-opening win last week against San Francisco spurred doubts. Darnold had played despite injuring his oblique days earlier while practicing, and in the week leading up to the NFC title-game matchup against the Rams, Darnold nursed the injury by ""barely practicing,"" said Macdonald, the Seahawks' coach.

Had the injury occurred halfway through the season, Darnold said, he might have been concerned by the lack of practice repetitions. He felt he'd accumulated enough by the championship game to trust his preparation.

He was right.

""It's should go down as one of the best performances in playoff history, I imagine"" considering his lack of practice time, Macdonald said.

One year after sacking him nine times in the playoffs, the Rams again tried to rattle Darnold with pressure that he countered by throwing three touchdowns.

It was Darnold's third consecutive game without a turnover.

Since throwing for four interceptions, without a touchdown, in a Week 11 loss to the Rams, Darnold has thrown for 12 touchdowns and four interceptions. After the Nov. 16 loss to the Rams, Darnold had impressed linebacker Ernest Jones IV by arriving early to the Seahawks' practice facility to begin working on the next week's opponent.

“Sam’s impressed me by like, he can just move forward,” Jones IV said. “...Sam trusts his arm, he trusts his ability and we trust Sam. So all you gotta do is give Sam that encouragement or whatever the case may be. Let him know that we got his back, and he’s able to lead us to a Super Bowl.”

That trust by Seattle in Darnold was apparent after getting the ball back with 4:54 left in the fourth quarter while holding a four-point lead and hoping to run out the clock. On the drive's seventh play, facing second and 10, Darnold rolled out to pass and found the NFL's leading receiver, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, for a first down. Two plays after that, on second and 7, Fox broadcaster Tom Brady expressed surprise that Seattle was putting the ball in Darnold's hands to pass on a bootleg play rather than run the ball, to try to run out the clock. It led to a defensive holding penalty.

""Courageous call,"" Brady said.

By the drive's end, the Rams got the ball back with just 25 seconds and were unable to drive the field in time for a go-ahead score.

In the Super Bowl, Darnold will face the same Patriots franchise that once flummoxed him so badly that cameras caught him telling Jets teammates on the sideline that he was ""seeing ghosts.""

Now the Patriots will be seeing a whole different quarterback.

""I almost forgot about it,"" Darnold said, smiling. ""For me, there was a lot that I didn't know back then, so I'm just going to continue to learn and grow in this great game. There's a lot of stuff that I can be better from today, even.""","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260125-darnold-1028-GR-57c4b2.jpg",N,,2026-01-26 11:04:04.546862

But the expectation is Gardner will be part of the Colts for the foreseeable future.
The presence of Gardner has taken on greater importance in light of the uncertain situation with the Colts' other top cornerback, Charvarius Ward.","INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indianapolis Colts had just executed one of the biggest trades in franchise history, and the excitement was still palpable.

Cornerback Sauce Gardner, a former No. 4 draft pick, had been acquired from the New York Jets for a huge haul, and the acquisition had the Colts -- who were 7-2 at the time -- thinking big.

Gardner, who had done nothing but lose games during the first half of the season in New York, was also thrilled.

""I'm looking forward to this year and my future as a Colt,"" he said in his introductory news conference on Nov. 6.

But what actually transpired in Gardner's immediate future was mostly a letdown. The Colts went into a tailspin that destroyed their season. And Gardner sustained a left calf injury that he couldn't shake. He went on to play just 36% of the team's defensive snaps in the eight games after the trade, and the Colts never reaped the immediate rewards they hoped the trade would yield.

Indianapolis, tied for the best record in the NFL at the time of the trade, lost its final seven games after a series of injuries that included quarterback Daniel Jones' season-ending ruptured right Achilles.

And yet, there is widespread optimism in the organization about Gardner moving forward.

""He's incredible,"" coach Shane Steichen said. ""He's a hell of a player. He's sticky in coverage. He's an elite corner that can win one-on-one matchups. Every time he was out there, he did a hell of a job doing it.

""So, [I'm] really looking forward to his future in this organization.""

The delayed gratification of the trade would seem difficult to accept. The Colts traded two first-round picks (2026 and 2027) and receiver Adonai Mitchell for Gardner. It was a huge cost, with some in NFL circles critiquing the deal even before Gardner's injury.

But the Colts are keeping the whole thing in perspective, believing that Gardner's presence on their roster for years to come is just as valuable as the potential playoff boost they hoped he was going to bring in the 2025 season.

For one, the Colts have emphasized their flexibility and contractual control of Gardner for five more seasons after he signed an extension with the Jets just last year. Gardner, a two-time first-team All-Pro selection, has a team-friendly contract with modest salary cap figures for the next two seasons. And if Gardner's play declines in the future, the Colts would suffer no cap consequence for moving on from him.

But the expectation is Gardner will be part of the Colts for the foreseeable future.

""I definitely think this is a long-term home, and that's been communicated to me,"" Gardner said. ""Teams need premier cornerbacks.""

General manager Chris Ballard, whose reputation is somewhat tied to the long-term outcome of the trade, remains bullish on Gardner. Ballard mulled the trade for weeks before executing it on the NFL's trade deadline in November.

""I kept asking myself, 'Look, would we get this guy in the draft?'"" Ballard said. ""Well, maybe [if we] get a little luck. But you're talking about a premier guy that's been to Pro Bowls. He's 24 years old and the contract was, we thought, advantageous to acquire.

""Sauce has got a really bright future, and he's going to be a core piece for us here for a while.""

Gardner has maintained a consistently optimistic attitude about the situation, even in light of his injury. He has quickly acclimated to his new surroundings and become popular among his teammates. And Gardner is all-in on Indianapolis.

""It's a lot of good that came out of this and is still coming out of this,"" he said at the conclusion of the season.

""I definitely look forward to being a part of the future here. I know I'm going to continue to do what I have to do on and off the field, so I'm looking forward to what we're going to do.""

The presence of Gardner has taken on greater importance in light of the uncertain situation with the Colts' other top cornerback, Charvarius Ward. He said earlier this month that he is contemplating retirement after severe complications following a series of concussions this season. Ward, one season into a three-year, $54 million contract, said he plans to discuss the issue with his family and come to a decision in the near future.

The Colts envisioned the pair of corners locking down receivers during the stretch run this season, but both ended up sidelined. But they see Gardner as a sure thing, a player quarterbacks will have to consistently contend with.

""We got a 24-year-old premier cornerback that still has upside,"" Ballard said. ""Those guys are not easy to find.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0122%2Fr1604257_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-26 12:03:38.929140

Predicting risers

Which prospect are you most excited to see in Mobile?

Miller:Caleb Banks, DT, Florida. Banks stands out on tape when healthy. But he wasn't healthy this past season after suffering a foot injuryin fall camp that ultimately limited him to three games. If he's well enough to participate this week, Banks could reignite the Round 1 buzz he had entering the season. The 6-foot-6, 330-pound nose tackle has a rare speed-to-power combination that would be a must-watch in individual drills against Senior Bowl offensive linemen.

Reid:Chris Johnson, CB, San Diego State. Johnson was named Mountain West Co-Defensive Player of the Year after intercepting four passes this season, two of which he returned for touchdowns. A true technician, the 6-foot 185-pounder has outstanding foot quickness, which allows him to remain sticky in press coverage. He also shows the spatial awareness to make plays in zone. Johnson needs to answer questions about his vertical speed and whether he can play with power-conference receivers, but he's already receiving strong Day 2 buzz. Don't be surprised if he's entrenched in the top 50 with a good performance in Mobile.

Yates;Keylan Rutledge, G, Georgia Tech. Why not go a little off the board here? I believe Rutledge will hear his name called on Day 2, as he started 26 games the past two seasons for a Yellow Jackets team that relies on gap schemes in the running game. The 6-foot-4, 320-pounder is one of this draft's most physical players, a trait he'll have the chance to showcase during one-on-ones. There are certain players whose play style immediately draws you in, and Rutledge does that for me. He could put a defender on his back a few times this week, both in practices and in Saturday's game.

Make one prediction about the Senior Bowl quarterbacks.

Reid:LSU'sGarrett Nussmeierwill be the most impressive passer this week because his anticipation and accuracy will shine in this setting. The 6-foot-1, 205-pound Nussmeier has a daredevil mentality and isn't shy about throwing into tight windows over the middle of the field or outside the numbers. His experience with altering protections at the line of scrimmage will also stand out. After a disappointing, injury-plagued season, Nussmeier will be looking to recapture the early-round buzz he had entering 2025. In speaking to scouts over the past few weeks, the highest projection I've heard is Round 3, but others had Round 5 or 6 grades on him. I think Nussmeier will improve on those this week.

Make one prediction about the pass catchers.

Yates: There will be a period of practice when NC State tight end Justin Jolysteals the spotlight. Joly, who spent his final two seasons with the Wolfpack after two years at UConn, is a terrific athlete and receiver at the position. Though he is listed at 6-foot-3 and 263 pounds on NC State's roster (Senior Bowl-verified measurements will come out early next week), he has the timing and catch radius to be one of those ""just throw it in his direction"" pass catchers. And keep an eye on him for Rounds 3-5 at the draft.

Make one prediction about the rest of the offensive group.

Miller: Penn State running back Nicholas Singletonwill break out. He has the tools to shine at the Senior Bowl after a quiet season in which he had only 549 rushing yards on 123 carries as part of a greater Nittany Lions offensive malaise. Singleton's burst at 6 feet, 224 pounds stands out as a trait that teams will always covet when evaluating running backs. There isn't a clear RB2 in the class behind Jeremiyah Love, and Singleton could rise into that ranking.

Make one prediction about the edge rusher group.

Reid: We'll be talking about Texas Tech'sRomello Height as one of the biggest risers of the week, and I expect him to generate eye-popping pressure during one-on-ones due to his bend and determination. The 6-foot-3, 235-pound Height combined with David Bailey to form a fearsome Red Raiders pass rush, finishing with 10 sacks this season. Height is a bit lean and will turn 25 before next season, but he could have an immediate, pivotal role as a situational pass rusher in the NFL. I see a late-Day 2, early-Day 3 prospect.

Make one prediction about the cornerback group.

Miller: Georgia is known for producing NFL defensive backs, and Daylen Everette will break out this week thanks to his elite size and SEC experience. The 6-foot-1, 190-pounder is sticky at the line of scrimmage and has parlayed that into five career interceptions. Everette's talent in press coverage makes him stand out on tape. And with the lack of high-end receiver talent at the Senior Bowl, Everette -- who is probably a third-rounder -- should excel in one-on-ones and when asked to hang near the line of scrimmage.

Make one prediction about the rest of the defensive group.

Yates:Pittsburgh'sKyle Louiswill emerge as one of the big winners of the week. He was a star linebacker for the Panthers, but he will almost assuredly move to safety in the NFL because of his frame (6-foot-1, 220 pounds) -- and I believe he has the skills to become a starter there. Louis has excellent ball skills (six interceptions over the past two seasons) and unmistakable tenacity. His energy will show up in practice, as will his coverage skills against tight ends. I believe he's a Day 2 pick.

Call your shot now: Which potential Day 3 sleepers will be big risers this week?

Kevin Coleman Jr., WR, Missouri. Coleman emerged as the Tigers' No. 1 wide receiver and a fifth-round prospect this season, catching 66 passes for 732 yards and 1 touchdown. His yards-after-catch ability at 5-foot-11, 180 pounds is notable. He's electric in space and has elite acceleration skills. Coleman also returned a punt for a touchdown this season, further highlighting his elusiveness. It seems as though an undersized receiver turns heads every year in Mobile, and Coleman's route-running skills and pure speed should stand out. -- Miller

Keyron Crawford, Edge, Auburn. Though first-round lock Keldric Faulk is the Auburn pass rusher who gets the headlines, Crawford caught my attention when I watched the Tigers this season. He finished fourth in the SEC with 43 pressures and is a bendy athlete with good quickness off the edge, along with standout hand usage. He uses a formidable swipe-and-chop move to get around pass protectors and should give tackles fits during one-on-ones. Crawford could come off the board anywhere from Round 3 to Round 5. -- Yates

J'Mari Taylor, RB, Virginia. Taylor was the engine of the Cavaliers' offense and one of the biggest surprises in the ACC this season. The North Carolina Central transfer made the FCS-to-FBS transition with ease, leading conference running backs with 14 touchdowns and finishing third with 1,062 rushing yards. Taylor is a sturdy, balanced rusher who also has value as a pass catcher out of the backfield. It's tough for running backs to excel in an all-star game setting, but Taylor is a fourth- or fifth-round prospect who could find his stock soaring after Senior Bowl week. -- Reid

Tacario Davis, CB, Washington. Remember two years ago, when Davis was at Arizona and we were talking about him as a potential Round 1 player? The 6-foot-4, 200-pound corner followed coach Jedd Fisch to Washington and saw his play decline, but the tools are still there. This week could be a reminder to scouts of his raw ability. As a press-coverage standout, Davis should be sticking to receivers at the line of scrimmage all week in practice. He carries a fifth-round grade at the moment. -- Miller

Ted Hurst, WR, Georgia State. Hurst had an excellent final season that included four games with 100-plus yards and four with a 50-plus-yard catch. Hurst is a big-bodied wideout (6-foot-3, 185 pounds) with impressive movement skills. Georgia State used him as a vertical threat and an underneath target on screen opportunities. When he reaches top speed, it's impressive to watch. This week will be a good test against top-tier competition, and I think he's a late-Day 2, early-Day 3 prospect. -- Yates

Max Iheanachor, OT, Arizona State. He played well against Texas Tech's Bailey-Height edge rusher duo and is a highly athletic tackle prospect. A former soccer and basketball player, Iheanachor's strong hands and light feet make him a prime candidate to shine during one-on-one pass-rush drills. He needs to get stronger as a run blocker, but Iheanachor is one of the best pass blockers in this year's class. He's viewed as a middle-round pick but could rise into the top 100 after this week. -- Reid

For Penn State quarterback Drew Allar, the news of a significant setback has inevitably cast a shadow over his future, particularly concerning his prospects for the 2026 NFL Draft. While the immediate concern is his recovery and return to the field, the ripple effects of such an injury in the hyper-competitive world of college football and professional scouting are undeniable.

We've seen how injuries can derail even the most talented players. The question now is how this particular setback will impact Allar's draft stock. Scouts and analysts are constantly evaluating not just raw talent, but also durability and the ability to perform under pressure, especially after adversity. The narrative around a player can shift dramatically, and a serious injury can introduce a new layer of uncertainty that wasn't there before.

It's not just about the physical toll; it's also about the mental fortitude required to come back stronger. For Allar, the path forward will involve not only rehabbing but also demonstrating that he can regain his form and leadership on the field. The upcoming season, whenever he's able to fully participate, will be crucial in rebuilding that confidence, both for himself and for the evaluators watching.

And let's be honest, the quarterback landscape in college football is always buzzing. Names like Shedeur Sanders and Arch Manning are frequently in the conversation, often compared and contrasted with players like Allar. There's a constant churn of talent, and while Allar has shown flashes of brilliance, the competition is fierce. Experts and fans alike are always looking for the next big thing, and the debate over who is truly 'better' is a constant fixture in sports media.

Interestingly, the reference material highlights a few key points that paint a broader picture. There's talk of Allar excelling off the field, which is certainly a positive sign of maturity and dedication. Penn State's hopes for a National Championship run are often tied to his performance, underscoring his importance to the team. Yet, there's also criticism regarding leadership, suggesting that even before any injury, the narrative around him wasn't entirely one-sided.

The NFL Draft, especially for quarterbacks, is a complex puzzle. Teams are looking for a blend of physical tools, mental acuity, and leadership. While Allar possesses many of the desired attributes, the injury adds a significant variable. It forces a re-evaluation of his timeline and his readiness for the professional level. Will teams see this as a temporary blip, or a reason to look elsewhere? The answer likely lies in his recovery and his performance in the games he can play.

We also see discussions about other promising quarterbacks, like Garrett Nussmeier and Luke Altmyer, being compared to Allar. This constant comparison is part of the game, and it underscores the depth of talent at the quarterback position in college football. It means that even if Allar recovers and plays well, he'll still be part of a crowded field vying for attention and, ultimately, NFL draft selection.

Ultimately, Drew Allar's journey is a compelling one to watch. The injury is a significant hurdle, but it doesn't necessarily define his entire future. His resilience, his ability to overcome this challenge, and his performance on the field will be the true determinants of his NFL prospects. The 2026 draft class is still taking shape, and while this injury presents a challenge, it's not the end of the story.",https://www.oreateai.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a6p7qra6p7qra6p7.png,N,,2026-01-26 10:00:10.013062

Kwesi and Kevin, Can you please sign Aaron Rodgers so we can get to the playoffs and possibly the Super Bowl?
As a fan for over 50 years, I'm starting to wonder if I will ever see that first Super Bowl win.","My mind wasn't on football much this weekend, but I'm going to keep the focus there in this edition.

Super Bowl LX will feature the Patriots and Seahawks on Feb. 8 in Northern California.

As the playoffs have reached this point, it's been an offseason filled with coaching changes across the NFL.

The NFL head coach openings reached 10 this offseason, matching 2022 when Vikings Head Coach Kevin O'Connell was hired.

He and Tampa Bay's Todd Bowles are the only two members of that class who are still with the teams that hired them.

The following teams have hired head coaches so far:

Dolphins: Jeff Hafley (was Packers DC from 2024-25)

Falcons: Kevin Stefanski (was Browns HC from 2020-25)

Giants: John Harbaugh (was Ravens HC from 2008-25)

Ravens: Jesse Minter (was Chargers DC from 2024-25)

Steelers: Mike McCarthy (last coached as Cowboys HC from 2020-24)

Titans: Robert Saleh (was 49ers DC in 2025 after being Jets HC from 2021-24)

The Bills, Browns, Cardinals and Raiders are still working on their hires.

That means there are numerous rows of dominoes still waiting to fall.

In the meantime, Vikings Defensive Coordinator Brian Flores signed a new contract with Minnesota (his previous one had expired earlier in January). Flores has interviewed for head coach openings and could still depart if chosen by another team for one of those positions, but for now, the Vikings can continue to evaluate prospects with the idea of their fit in Flores' scheme, which is valuable considering college all-star games are happening.

Teams are evaluating prospects at the 101st East-West Shrine Bowl in Frisco, Texas (game is this Tuesday night on NFL Network) and are sending evaluators to Mobile, Alabama, for the 77th Senior Bowl (game is Saturday on NFL Network).

Vikings.com's Rob Kleifield is heading down to the Gulf Coast to cover this week's Senior Bowl practices, so be on the lookout for coverage from ""L.A."" (Lower Alabama).

Let's get to some questions.

I really enjoyed watching Jalen Redmond play this past season. The Vikings have done pretty good with UDFAs, but he's truly a cut above. I hope they sign him to a four-to-five-year extension really soon so we can keep him after a decent season. I think he'll be a bit more expensive if he keeps up his production.

— Jason Gibeaut in Gallipolis, Ohio

If anyone missed last week's position recap of the defensive line, Redmond was a central figure throughout and listed by our Lindsey Young as the group's ""Unsung Hero,"" although we both agree that Redmond's flowers already began arriving, especially from Vikings fans. It's quite likely that his game film raised eyebrows across the NFL, and if he continues this trajectory, other fan bases will know him, as well.

Redmond scored well in metric after metric this season, showing impressive improvements from 2024 and is someone the Vikings are quite excited about continuing his career in Purple.

The in-depth, never-stop-combing scouting efforts that landed Redmond in summer of 2024 show relentlessness can yield rewards. Redmond is an exclusive rights free agent for 2026, making it highly likely he will be with Minnesota. This page from the NFL Operations Manual explains categories of free agents.

Redmond was set to become one last offseason before reaching a deal last January with the team, well ahead of free agency.

There's a baseline for what Redmond could make for 2026, but the Vikings might also consider going beyond that to avoid a future bidding battle with other teams once Redmond is no longer an ERFA. His line of 62 tackles, 12 TFLs, 6.0 sacks and five passes swatted at the line of scrimmage, along with a forced fumble and two fumble recoveries certainly generates a buzz.

Have the Vikings considered adding Malik Willis from Green Bay as a quarterback? He seems like a great option.

— D. Heine

We know that O'Connell and General Manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah emphasized that making the QBs room as deep and talented as possible during their end-of-season press conferences.

That could involve bringing in a free agent or making a trade if a veteran addition is desired.

Carson Wentz was added right before the season on a one-year deal. He is among this year's class of pending free agents.

Spotrac.com has a convenient list of QBs who are pending free agents that include Willis, the former Titans third-round pick who has impressed as Green Bay's backup for the past two seasons. Willis will be just 27 on May 27, so there's a good bit of football ahead for him.

It will be interesting to see what the market is for the free agent QBs. I've heard some people mention Willis being a candidate for some substantial dollars heading his way. Daniel Jones is oft-mentioned as one of the most likely to generate interest, but he's coming off a late-season Achilles injury.

Note: this was sent earlier last week before Flores' new contract was announced, but I'm including to cover the second part of the question.

Will the Vikings receive compensation if they lose Brian Flores to a head coaching job since his contract actually expired?

If so, what is that compensation and what year? Sure hope to keep him as our coordinator.

— Rick in Blaine, Minnesota

I'm not exactly sure how the determination would have fallen on the awarding of any comp picks since Flores' contract had expired.

Now that Flores has signed a new deal, if he was hired by a team to be its head coach, then Minnesota would be awarded a third-round compensatory pick this year and another in the 2027 NFL Draft.

Let's keep this season in perspective! Most independent analysts predicted the Vikings to go 9-8. If the Vikings had a reasonable number of injuries, and ""even Steven"" luck, I think we would have hit that mark easily. No one should really expect to win the Super Bowl with essentially a rookie quarterback. It is a two-year project!

— Joe in Phoenix, Arizona

The six quarterbacks selected in the first round in 2024 — Caleb Williams (No. 1 overall), Jayden Daniels (No. 2), Drake Maye (No. 3), Michael Penix, Jr. (No. 8), J.J. McCarthy (No. 10) and Bo Nix (No. 12) — will forever be intertwined.

The teams of Maye and Nix advanced to the AFC Championship, but Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the Divisional Round. Maye now has a chance at winning Super Bowl LX. Daniels and the Commanders made it to the NFC Championship Game in his rookie season before hobbling through a rough 2025. Williams and the Bears made it to the Divisional Round but were outlasted by the Rams.

That leaves Penix and McCarthy as the only two so far who are waiting for their first postseason action, but McCarthy is the only one in the bunch who has had only one season as a starter.

He turned 23 last Tuesday. Williams turned 24 in November, Daniels turned 25 in December, Maye will be 24 in August, Penix will be 26 in May, and Nix will be 26 in February.

While all are through the second year of their rookie deals, there's more of a runway for McCarthy's development, which can be among factors in draft decisions.

Minnesota winning 14 games in 2024 with Sam Darnold on a one-year deal guided the conversations about the Vikings to being a team in ""win now"" mode. Instead of using the franchise tag on Darnold for an extra year of his services or trying to counter the substantial (and dividend-yielding) deal offered by Super Bowl-bound Seattle, the Vikings pivoted to McCarthy and tried to implement what they thought would best fit around a QB who was learning in real time with every rep. McCarthy going into this full NFL offseason healthy should be quite helpful for his development.

The Vikings do readily admit room for team improvements so that results are above the 9-8 record thanks to an encouraging finish.

Kwesi and Kevin,

Can you please sign Aaron Rodgers so we can get to the playoffs and possibly the Super Bowl? We now know for sure McCarthy isn't ready yet and couldn't have a better mentor for a season than a three-time MVP and Super Bowl Winner! Get our o-line right, and Rodgers will take us to new heights I and thousands of other fans haven't felt since we had Brett Favre!

— Dan Staton in Cedar Rapids, Iowa

Favre turned 40 during the 2009 season that nearly ended with the ultimate dream for Vikings fans. Rodgers turned 42 in December, and while he and the Steelers topped Minnesota in Dublin, Pittsburgh finished with a 10-7 showing that won the AFC North before losing in the first round of the playoffs.

I'm not sure if Rodgers will decide this was the end of the train tracks or if he'll want another chance with Pittsburgh (and a reunion with Mike McCarthy) or to go to another team. I did think he looked more in 2025 like what we've come to expect from Rodgers than he did in 2024 when he was in his first season back from the Achilles injury.

I didn't realize this, but Rodgers' most recent playoff victory was Jan. 16, 2021.

I mentioned in my previous response that I think McCarthy stands to benefit significantly from a full, healthy offseason, as well as the in-game experiences he had during his first 10 career starts.

Dan's comments about getting the o-line ""right"" are valid because I think any QB would have struggled for a team using 26 different combinations of offensive linemen. Experience perhaps could have masked some weaknesses, but the Steelers offensive line showed to be no match for Houston's defensive line in the Wild Card, and it affected a first-ballot Hall of Fame QB.

As a fan for over 50 years, I'm starting to wonder if I will ever see that first Super Bowl win. I believe in K.O. as the head coach, but I think Kwesi's drafts have been awful!! If you look at the roster, how many of the starters and key players were drafted by Rick Spielman? He had misses, too, but look at the roster and see how many core players were drafted more than four years ago under a different system vs. the past four. I hope he figures it out soon, as I just watched Bo Nix take his team to the AFC Championship, and he was drafted after J.J. And we all know about the safety he passed on that is an All-Pro with Baltimore, and Kwesi drafted one that's out of the league.

— Dave in Rapid City, South Dakota

Everyone has hits and misses in drafting. It's then about how much the hits can offset the misses or how quickly a miss can be stop-gapped.

There are some residual players selected with drafts led by Spielman that have continued to be important foundational players. Adofo-Mensah's first draft class (2022) included 10 selections with five on offense and five on defense, and the results were not what anyone envisioned.

Only running back Ty Chandler and receiver Jalen Nailor remained with the team in 2025. Chandler's fourth season was impacted adversely by a knee injury suffered in Week 1. Nailor had some nice games and a couple of down moments but showed a general growth every season where he could become a free agent sought by multiple other teams this offseason.

Switching defensive coordinators and schemes one year after the first draft was one factor, but there were others in play, including the severe leg injury Lewis Cine suffered a few games into his career. Another impact affecting playing time for more recent draft picks has been Minnesota's success in free agency.

We've seen some of Spielman's later-round picks develop (Joshua Metellus and Blake Brandel come to mind) and be re-signed by the current administration. We've also seen the current administration mine the undrafted free agent market for a difference maker like Myles Price.

Nix definitely made some plays, particularly key ones near the end of the Divisional Round game against Buffalo, but it is worth noting the Broncos ranked No. 3 in points against and No. 2 in yards allowed this season. Yes, I do know that Minnesota finished No. 7 and No. 3 in those categories.

Ideally the expected general continuity of coaching staff with Flores in line to stay, will position Minnesota's defense to start 2026 the way it closed 2025 (even if some personnel changes occur), and the offense can take the necessary steps forward to be a more complete team in position of making a deep postseason run.

Seattle went 10-7 in 2024, losing a tiebreaker to the Rams for the NFC West and missing the playoffs by one spot. The moves the Seahawks made this offseason elevated that team to the No. 1 seed and sent the squad to the franchise's fourth Super Bowl appearance.

Vikings offensive line coach Chris Kuper was let go. Twenty-plus different personnel combinations. An 11-percent sack rate. How much of this was Kuper's fault and how much was bad luck with injuries? Whoever they hire to be the new line coach better have a plan on how to keep the offensive line healthy. There was a great letter in last week's mailbag about how long it took QBs like Troy Aikman, Peyton Manning, John Elway, Drew Brees and Steve Young to find their footing and establish themselves. Patience is key. Will Carson Wentz be healthy enough to serve as the veteran presence in the QB room?

— Gerald Goblirsch

There's always a human element involved with every coaching change that gets disregarded far too often. Families are involved, and I wish the best for people in their next chapter. Kuper's contract expired, and he was not offered another one.

The sacks per pass attempt checked in at 12.4 percent, which ranked 31st in the NFL. Some sacks were on McCarthy waiting with the football too long while reading the defense, some were on deep-developing plays and others occurred too fast within a play.

Minnesota's effort to remake the interior of its offensive line did not come to full fruition because of injuries to Ryan Kelly and then backup Michael Jurgens, which led to Brandel playing the center position for the first time, but there was some encouraging play by first-round pick Donovan Jackson, and the Vikings believe Will Fries will continue ascending after having shaken off the rust from the broken leg he suffered in 2024 with the Colts.

We will keep you posted on Minnesota's plans for the offensive line.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/vikings/f0h6gubpyobbjnjoaaj6,N,,2026-01-26 12:03:43.511309

The 49ers lost the most points to injury among playoff teams, just ahead of the Buffalo Bills who lost 190 points.
They were 12th overall and third among playoff teams at 148 points lost − seven touchdowns (with extra points) and a field goal fewer than the 49ers.","Injuries helped define the San Francisco 49ers' 2026 season, but one analytics site went as far as calculating exactly how much they and the 31 other teams were impacted by those injuries.

Sports Info Solutions tallied each team's total games missed due to injury. Then they went a step further and estimated the number of points lost based on which players were out and how much time they missed. This helps take into account the impact of a player's time missed. For example, rookie reserve linebacker Nick Martin missing four games to injury would be less impactful on the scoreboard than Christian McCaffrey missing one game due to injury.

It turns out that the 49ers neither had the most games lost nor the most points lost to injury, but they did lead all playoff teams in the second category.

SIS had San Francisco's roster down for 262 total games missed to injury − the seventh-highest total in the league and the fourth-most among teams that reached the postseason.

What hurt the 49ers most this season, however, wasn't their total number of games missed. It was the quality of the players who were sent to the sidelines. That includes wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk, tight end George Kittle, quarterback Brock Purdy, linebacker Fred Warner and defensive end Nick Bosa who all missed either a significant portion of or the entire 2025 campaign.

Because of the quality of players San Francisco saw injuries to, their total points lost landed at 200 per SIS. That was the third-highest mark in the NFL behind the Arizona Cardinals (266 points) and the Washington Commanders (230). The 49ers lost the most points to injury among playoff teams, just ahead of the Buffalo Bills who lost 190 points.

That duo was well clear of the next playoff team, the Los Angeles Chargers. They were 12th overall and third among playoff teams at 148 points lost − seven touchdowns (with extra points) and a field goal fewer than the 49ers.

San Francisco did manage to get some key players back on offense by the end of the year, as evidenced by their 35.7 points from Weeks 11-17. The defensive side is where injuries were a major problem. The 49ers' pass rush was non-existent and their ability to stay organized and effective against the run and pass in the second level went away without Warner manning the middle of their front seven.

There are a slew of holes the 49ers have to fill on their roster this offseason, but their path back to a Super Bowl starts with their stars staying healthy.","https://ninerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/25/SNIN/88351377007-usatsi-27232285.jpg?crop=8231,4630,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-26 10:00:13.973860

What Giannis' injury means in Milwaukee - CBS Sports,Jack Maloney,,,,,https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/giannis-antetokounmpos-injury-bucks-blessing-in-disguise/,"What does that mean for him and the Bucks, and could this injury actually be a blessing in disguise?
Antetokounmpo's injury throws a major wrench into the deadline plans for the Bucks and every other team that was waiting for a resolution on his status.
However, this calf injury will likely keep him from playing in the mid-season showcase for the second consecutive year.
He also sat out last year due to a calf injury.
This is the fourth time in the last three seasons that Antetokounmpo has suffered a calf injury.","MILWAUKEE -- Shortly after the Milwaukee Bucks suffered yet another loss on Friday night, this one by two points after a furious comeback attempt against the Denver Nuggets' back-ups fell short, Giannis Antetokounmpo sat at his locker and let out a yell. He then clapped his hands loudly in frustration, put on his socks and turned to face the media.

He had bad news to deliver about his right calf, which had been limiting him all night and kept him out of the final 34 seconds.

""The next steps will be go to MRI tomorrow, after the MRI they will tell me probably I popped something in my calf, or my soleus, something. They'll probably give me a protocol of 4-6 weeks that I'll be out. This is from my experience being around in the NBA,"" Antetokounmpo said. ""After that, I'm going to work my butt off to come back. That will probably be the end of February, beginning of March. Hopefully the team will be in a place that we can at least make the Play-In or the playoffs. Just take it day-by-day, try to get better.""

The Bucks have not announced an official timeline for Antetokounmpo's injury, but he missed over three weeks earlier this season with a calf strain on the same leg, and indicated that this injury felt the same to him. He is likely heading back to the sidelines for an extended period, and could be out through the trade deadline (Feb. 5) and All-Star Weekend (Feb. 13-15), and possibly longer.

What does that mean for him and the Bucks, and could this injury actually be a blessing in disguise?

Time to tank?

The Bucks got off to a 4-1 start that included wins over the Toronto Raptors, Golden State Warriors and New York Knicks. It seemed as though their audacious offseason plan to waive-and-stretch Damian Lillard, sign Myles Turner and surround Antetokounmpo with shooting could pay off.

Since then, however, they've been one of the worst teams in the league, in part due to a parade of injuries. Friday's loss to the Nuggets was their sixth in the last eight games, and they're now a season-worst eight games below .500. At 18-26, they are in 11th place in the Eastern Conference, 2 ½ games behind the Atlanta Hawks for the final Play-In Tournament spot.

The Bucks are closer to the Brooklyn Nets for the fifth-worst record in the league than they are to the Philadelphia 76ers for a top-six spot in the East. For the season, the Bucks are 3-11 with Antetokounmpo out of the lineup. At that pace, they have little hope of still being in the Play-In race if he's out until after the All-Star break.

While the Bucks do not control their own first-round pick in the 2026 NBA Draft, they will have a first-round pick. They will receive the least favorable of their pick and the New Orleans Pelicans' first-round pick. The 11-36 Pelicans have the second-worst record in the league and are well on their way to a top-five selection. If both teams are bad, that guarantees the Bucks a good pick.

It's impossible for the Bucks to get the No. 1 overall pick, but they could pick as high as No. 2 if they continue to fall down the standings and get some lottery luck. A top-five selection in what is regarded as a generational draft class is well within the realm of possibility, depending on when/if Antetokounmpo returns. The Bucks haven't drafted higher than No. 10 since Antetokounmpo came to town, and this could be a rare chance to get an elite talent while he is still on the roster.

Giannis Antetokounmpo shouldn't play another game for the Bucks this season, and probably not ever again

Sam Quinn

What about the trade deadline?

Earlier this month, Antetokounmpo told Sam Amick of The Athletic that he would never request a trade. However, after the Bucks' narrow win over the Hawks on Monday, Antetokounmpo was asked if he would finish the season in Milwaukee and responded, ""I don't know. I take it day-by-day.""

Following the Bucks' loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday, Antetokounmpo called out his teammates for being ""selfish"" and ""not playing hard."" Shams Charania then reported Friday that discussions between the Bucks and Antetokounmpo about his future had ""intensified in nature"" and that the ""tension"" inside the organization and locker room was at an ""all-time high.""

Over the last month, however, there were numerous reports that the Bucks had actually been looking to buy at the deadline to increase their chances of making the playoffs in a weaker-than-usual Eastern Conference.

About the only thing that had been clear about Antetokounmpo's future in Milwaukee was that the entire league was watching.

""Giannis is the trade deadline,"" Brian Windhorst said earlier this week. ""There is really not a lot of other players out there that can move the needle. There is very small to no market for Ja Morant or Anthony Davis. The entire league is watching Giannis.""

Antetokounmpo's injury throws a major wrench into the deadline plans for the Bucks and every other team that was waiting for a resolution on his status.

The Bucks should no longer be buyers at the deadline or entertain any deals in which they give up future assets such as Ryan Rollins or their 2031 first-round pick. It's unclear how Antetokounmpo's injury will impact other teams' pursuit of the two-time MVP, but it likely increases the odds that he remains with the Bucks for the rest of the season.

Antetokounmpo likely out of the All-Star Game (again) and award consideration

Antetokounmpo was recently named as a starter for the All-Star Game for the 10th consecutive season, which is the longest active streak in the league. However, this calf injury will likely keep him from playing in the mid-season showcase for the second consecutive year. He also sat out last year due to a calf injury.

In addition, this injury will end Antetokounmpo's chances of award consideration. The 65-game threshold for major awards means that players cannot miss more than 17 games in a season. Antetokounmpo has already missed 14 games, and even if he comes back earlier than expected, he's going to miss four more games.

Antetokounmpo has been named to the All-NBA First Team and finished in the top-four in MVP voting in each of the last seven seasons. Those streaks will come to an end.

""It's hard, but always in my mind I think of the good things that have happened in my life, and I think of where I am in this moment, and what my goals are, and what stops me from these goals, which might be this injury, and the first thing that you have to think about is that it can be way worse,"" Antetokounmpo said Friday. ""You can be out for 12 months, 18 months. Being out for two, three, four, five, six weeks, whatever the case may be and not making the All-NBA, for sure it's gonna hurt. For sure it will be a little bit frustrating, but it doesn't matter. That's not where we are right now mentally as a team, as a player. All-NBA it's in June, I'm in January.""

Can the Bucks turn this into a positive?

This is the fourth time in the last three seasons that Antetokounmpo has suffered a calf injury.

In addition to the right calf strain that kept him out for three weeks earlier this season, he missed over two weeks (and sat out of the All-Star Game) last season due to a left calf strain. A left calf strain also kept him out of the final week of the regular season and the playoffs in 2024.

""I don't think it looks great, personally,"" Bucks coach Doc Rivers said Friday. ""This calf keeps coming up and it's concerning. I'm not a doctor, but I'm smart enough to know that his calf keeps bothering him and there's something that is there and it keeps happening, and that's troublesome for all of us.""

No one in Milwaukee wanted to see Antetokounmpo injured yet again, but there's a chance for the Bucks to turn this into a long-term positive.

This team is not going anywhere this season. Since their 4-1 start, they have three wins against teams in the top-six in either conference, and overall they are 24th in offensive rating, 21st in defensive rating and 24th in net rating (-3.4). Even in a world where they made some moves at the deadline and fought their way into the Play-In, they were not going to be a contender.

Now, there's a very good chance they end up with a top-10 pick, and possibly even higher than that -- especially if Antetokounmpo's injury keeps him out for more than a month (at which point there's little reason for him to return at all this season). Whatever happens with Antetokounmpo down the line, that's much better for their future than a futile Play-In chase.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/25/1fd314b9-602a-4003-b47f-0aaa03c6f3c8/thumbnail/1200x675/92e73abecf634a58f440295e69a0c01c/giannis-getty-33.png,N,,2026-01-26 10:00:21.735407

But that would’ve brought cameras. And shifted too many eyeballs towards him than he was comfortable with.

So the Broncos’ injured second-year QB watched the AFC Championship Game from a suite at Empower Field, wanting to not draw attention to himself. And beyond a few shots on the CBS broadcast, the camera was instead trained on Nix’s replacement: 29-year-old backup Jarrett Stidham, a West Texas boy who rolled in for the first start of his Denver career in a cowboy hat.

Come spring 2026, though, Nix will be back in a Broncos uniform and shoulder pads. A source confirmed to The Denver Post that Nix’s season-ending ankle surgery this past week will have a roughly 12-week timetable for recovery, and that doctors have pinpointed that Nix should be able to return to action by the Broncos’ organized team activities in late May.

ESPN’s Adam Schefter first reported that Nix had a 12-week timetable to return.

After the fractured ankle that shocked the entire city of Denver in a 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills on Saturday, Jan. 17, Nix flew to Birmingham, Alabama, for a Tuesday ankle surgery performed by Dr. Norman Waldrop of Andrews Sports Medicine. Broncos head coach Sean Payton said this week that the operation went well, and that he’d like Nix around the organization again as soon as he was able to be.

“Absolutely — all of our guys that have been injured are part of this team, and so, sooner the better,” Payton said Wednesday.

Nix offered his first public comments since the surgery on Thursday, with a lengthy caption on an Instagram post that said the last few days had been “hard to put into words.”

“What started as one of the most exciting games I’ve ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I’ve ever received,” Nix wrote. “This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it.”

If Nix’s timeline goes according to plan, the Broncos’ starting quarterback will have ramped up well before the start of training camp in 2026.

Nix finished his second season in Denver with 3,931 passing yards and 30 total touchdowns against 11 interceptions, leading the NFL in passing attempts with 612. He shouldered much of the Broncos’ offense in the wild-card win over Buffalo, either dropping back or running the ball on 85% of Denver’s total attempts from scrimmage.

Pat Bryant exits with a hamstring injury

Pat Bryant’s recent stretch of tough injury luck continues.

The Broncos rookie wideout left the AFC Championship Game in the first half due to a hamstring injury and was later ruled out. Bryant, Denver’s third-round pick out of Illinois last April, has now been injured in three of his last four games.

The 23-year-old suffered a scary-looking concussion in Week 16 against Jacksonville, when he was carted off the field and taken to the hospital for further evaluation. Then, Bryant left last week’s divisional win over Buffalo in the first quarter with another concussion.

Bryant had three catches for 32 yards in that game, and finished the regular season with 31 catches for 378 yards and one TD in 15 games. Prior to his injury against Jacksonville, his role in the Denver offense had been increasing, including a career-high 82 yards receiving in the 22-19 home win over Kansas City on Nov. 16.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26017763553070.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2026-01-25 23:58:32.522231

The Seahawks will face the New England Patriots on Feb. 8 in Santa Clara for the NFL title.

Sam Darnold passed for 346 yards and three touchdowns for the Seahawks in a showdown with Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford, who passed for 374 yards and three touchdowns.

Share your thoughts on today’s game: live@theathletic.com

Sam Darnold continues to play without limitations despite dealing with an oblique injury suffered on Jan. 15. Darnold made every throw he typically makes in the divisional-round win over the 49ers and he’s again operating normally against the Rams. He’s 7-of-9 for 114 yards through one quarter and has already made multiple throws rolling to his left.

The Rams pass rush has yet to get to Sam Darnold on nine first-quarter drop-backs, but Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak has had a good plan to negate it with runs to Kenneth Walker III, screen passes and play-action roll-outs.

Los Angeles has had Darnold's number with pressure over the past year-plus, and it's going to need to find ways to rev that engine today, which will have to start by stopping the run better. Walker averaged 4.4 yards on eight carries in that first quarter, after which Seattle leads 10-3.

That one-handed catch from Jaxon Smith-Njigba? That certainly caught the attention of several of our readers.

Below are some of your thoughts on that epic one-handed grab:

Christopher L.: That one handed catch from JSN changed my life!

David H.: JSN with the one-hander 🤣. He didn’t even tuck it in but held it in his open hand.

Paul C.: Holy cow—what a catch!

The home crowd wanted a call but I think it's good here at the start of this one — after the controversy last time around — that the officials are letting these guys play.

Q1 0:55 - Seahawks 10, Rams 3

A holding penalty backs the Seahawks up to second-and-goal from the 19... and then Kenneth Walker III gets those 10 yards back on a screen. But Sam Darnold can’t link up with A.J. Barner in the end zone. No flag despite contact on both sides there. Jason Myers hits the 27-yard chip shot and the Seahawks are back up by 7.

Klint Kubiak is already borrowing a little of what Chicago did well in the run game against the Rams defense last week. In simple terms, it's ""run around Poona Ford"" - wide stretch runs that are asking the linebackers to travel horizontally. When the Rams adjusted and stretched their front, Ken Walker just hit them up the gut on back to back 8-yard runs.

Q1 8:15 - Seahawks 7, Rams 3

Sean McVay immediately tries to push the ball downfield further, but Matthew Stafford’s passes to Puka Nacua and Davante Adams fall incomplete. Stafford then can’t link up with Nacua short of the sticks.

Harrison Mevis gets L.A. on the board with a 44-yard field goal.

Rashid Shaheed was acquired at the trade deadline. Last week, the Seahawks receiver began the team's postseason with a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.

Today, he jolts the Seahawks' offense with a 51-yard reception.

Yeah, that trade was worth it for Seattle.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/A5ycpWGkjLfg_eYcx07utSTX6_1440x960.jpg",N,,2026-01-25 23:58:43.950712

We're down to the NFL's version of the Final Four, and we're blessed with an exceedingly light injury report in terms of potential short-term absences.

RUNNING BACKS

The Seahawks' George Holani (hamstring) was activated from injured reserve Friday and doesn't carry an injury designation for Sunday's conference championship clash against the Rams. Holani could be in line to serve as the No. 2 running back for Seattle behind Kenneth Walker, considering Zach Charbonnet's (IR, knee) status. However, both Velus Jones and Cam Akers were promoted from the practice squad Saturday, and the duo does have more experience than Holani.

After being promoted to QB1, Stidham is set to start against the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game on Sunday.

Stidham played well during preseason in August, but he hasn't started a regular season game since the end of the 2023 season. Amazingly, the Broncos were the only team in the NFL that did not have a backup quarterback attempt a pass during the 2025 regular season (and the same stat was also true in 2024).

Stidham is set to become the first quarterback in NFL history to make his first start of the season in a conference championship game after not attempting a single pass in the regular season, according to OptaSTATS. But he won't be the first QB to make his first start of the season in a conference title game.

Following the 1972 season, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach started (and lost) the NFC Championship game after not starting any regular-season games. Fortunately for Stidham, there are examples of backup QBs leading their teams to titles.

Ten backup quarterbacks took over and led their teams to Super Bowl wins, with Nick Foles (2017) being the most recent example.

""What those guys have done and accomplished is incredible, but I’m not going to get too far ahead of myself or anything like that,"" Stidham said after practice last week. ""Like I said, just focused on the day-to-day right now, and being prepared for Sunday and trying to go out there and win a ballgame.""

Before dreaming about a trip to the Super Bowl, Stidham must first focus on upsetting the Patriots in the AFC title game on Sunday. When coach Sean Payton was asked about past backup QBs who have won it all, he deflected attention off Stidham and onto the team.

“It’s a team game, right?"" Payton said last week. ""[In past] cases, there were different scenarios. The key is how we as a team prepare this week for the team we’re getting ready to play Sunday. We’re playing a real good team. Both teams ended up with the same record [14-3]. That’s really the short answer.”

It's a daunting task for Stidham, but he won't face it alone. If Denver's going to pull off an upset, it will take a team effort with a productive run game, opportunistic defense and effective special teams play. But it's a QB-driven league, so all eyes will be on Stidham on Sunday afternoon.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/22/SBRC/88292894007-jarrett-stidham-backup-q-bs-who-won-super-bowl.jpg?crop=1838,1035,x0,y139&width=1838&height=1035&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-25 21:59:24.349360

The Vikings finished with a 9-8 record despite poor play from McCarthy, but Hall of Famer Cris Carter thinks the team has a “problem.”

After missing the entirety of the 2024 season due to a knee injury, McCarthy made his much-anticipated debut this season.

However, McCarthy did anything but impress, passing for just 1,632 yards with 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.

He only played 10 games due to countless injuries, and Carter thinks the Vikings made a mistake giving McCarthy the keys to the franchise.

“He has not done anything that would exhibit the traits to being a franchise quarterback,” Carter told The U.S. Sun via SBR online casino bonuses.

“Tell me what he does exceptionally? There’s an inability to stay healthy and he’s in the third year of this experiment.”

Carter is especially upset with how the Vikings handled things with Sam Darnold.

The Vikings won 14 games in 2024 with Darnold under center, and he passed for 4,319 yards with 35 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.

This season, Darnold signed with the Seattle Seahawks and led his new teams to 14 wins and a spot in the NFC Championship.

“This is easy to see,” Carter said.

“He has not proven anything and they don’t know anything. They have more regret right now because the quarterback we had last year won 14 games.

“And guess what he did this year? He won 14 more games and they’re the No. 1 seed in the NFC.”

At this point, the Vikings are stuck with McCarthy until his rookie contract is over.

After finishing 9-8, they aren’t in a good enough position to draft a new quarterback, and they don’t have the money or trade capital to acquire one.

“When you’re in the third year of your contract and the franchise and general manager look at you and say ‘I don’t know,’ then you have a problem,” Carter said.

“They’re stuck with JJ McCarthy.”

Darnold “attempted only short and medium throws at practice and did not, as one source described, ‘let it rip'” during practice this week, according to ESPN.

Seattle coach Mike Macdonald told reporters earlier this week that the lighter throwing schedule was by design to manage Darnold’s injury, before adding Friday that the two-time Pro Bowler has been improving daily.

Lock replaced Darnold for Seattle’s final two series in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s blowout win over San Francisco, but the seven-year veteran did not attempt a pass.

Darnold was the third overall pick in the 2018 draft by the Jets, but he was traded to Carolina in 2021.

Q2 9:22 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

New England's momentum after the stop is quickly erased as Drake Maye is dropped by D.J. Jones on first-and-10 to start the possesion.

The second-year quarterback does not look comfortable yet.

I know Sean Payton likes to be aggressive. Remember the onside kick in Super Bowl XLIV?

But why the Broncos went for it on fourth-and-1 instead of taking the three points to take a two score lead boggles the mind.

Q2 9:22 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

Denver calls timeout ahead of the fourth-down attempt.

That play was destined for failure from the outset as the Broncos turn the ball over on downs. It was a play-action bootleg but two rushers immediately got after the quarterback and all the underneath throws were completely stifled, causing Jarrett Stidham to throw a dangerous ball intended for RJ Harvey that skipped incomplete.

That's a huge stand for New England and a moment to bookmark as this game unfolds.

Q2 10:11 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

A short run by RJ Harvey and a scramble by Jarrett Stidham for a couple set up third-and-6 in the red zone.

New England sends heat, and Stidham immediately takes off to his right, scampering for 5 yards to set up fourth-and-1.

Q2 12:17 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

That's a good ball by Jarrett Stidham to move the chains again on third down. He sat in the pocket and delivered a decisive ball to Lil'Jordan Humphrey on an out route for a gain of 3 yards.

Two players later, after a run by RJ Harvey and a powerful run by fullback Adam Prentice, Denver has another first down to New England's 23-yard line.

In three playoff games, the Patriots have a combined 7 points scored in the first quarter. Two of those three games, including today, they put zero on the board through one quarter.

New England starts slow. The Patriots haven’t been able to solve this Broncos defense yet though! By far the best defense they have faced in these playoffs.

End Q1 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

A run by Jaleel McLaughlin and a connection from Jarrett Stidham to Evan Engram give Denver a first down into New England territory as the first quarter comes to an end.

That is an encouraging first frame for Sean Payton and company.

Que Robinson, the rookie edge rusher who ripped down Drake Maye for a 9-yard sack to spoil New England's third drive, was only active in six games due to the regular season, biding his time behind a deep and healthy edge rush group.

The Broncos have raved about the progress of the fourth-round pick out of Alabama behind the scenes, and he demonstrated why on that play, rapidly closing the gap on Maye as the Patriots quarterback rolled to his right.

Pressure has been significant early for Denver's vaunted pass rush. Patriots have minus-2 net yards passing and 8 total yards on three drives.

Q1 0:54 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

The Broncos defense is balling right now!

On second-and-6, Drake Maye rolled out to his right on a bootleg but Que Robinson diagnosed the play perfectly, closed the gap and slung the quarterback down for a sack to set up third-and-15. Maye attempts to find Rhamondre Stevenson on a checkdown but fires wide as New England's offensive woes continue, leading to a punt.

A Denver score on this drive would apply a lot of pressure to this already sputtering unit.

It doesn’t look like Robert Spillane is returning any time soon.

After being looked at by trainers, the Patriots middle linebacker went and shook hands with fellow linebackers, then walked back to the locker room.

He’s the Patriots’ leading tackler and a huge part of the team’s defense.

Three Broncos drives and it’s evident Sean Payton is using a lot of motion with his offense. He also isn’t afraid to allow Jarrett Stidham to use his legs, as we saw on that designed QB run.

Stidham’s going to need to throw the ball if the Broncos want to win this game. But Denver is leaning on its balanced approach with run and pass plays to start.

Q1 2:28 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

An inside zone to RJ Harvey out of shotgun is blown up by New England for no gain, setting up third-and-9.

Jarrett Stidham drops back and puts a ball on the body of Courtland Sutton but the veteran wideout bobbles it before ultimately dropping it. Drops have been a problem for the veteran wideout all season and this is another example. It was not a perfect ball but certainly catchable.

Denver punts.

Q1 6:33 - Broncos 7, Patriots 0

New England picks up a first down to start the drive but the possession fizzles out quickly after.

A screen to Stefon Diggs is blown up, followed by perfect coverage downfield from Pat Surtain on a deep ball intended for Kayshon Boutte. On third-and-12, Drake Maye finds Diggs underneath again but he is dropped after a gain of just 3 yards, leading to another Patriots punt.

Denver's defense has to put together a stellar performance here this afternoon and so far this unit appears up for the challenge.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/seBXB81yUtwW_S7sqXyqm0Sbb_1440x960.jpg",N,,2026-01-25 15:59:08.505274

Did you have Lil’Jordan Humphrey and offensive tackle Frank Crum both scoring touchdowns for the Broncos last week on your bingo card? Well, either way, both found the end zone as Denver advanced to the AFC Championship Game.

Humphrey became a significant part of the game plan with Troy Franklin out and Pat Bryant suffering a concussion in the first quarter, as he had two catches for 33 yards, including a 29-yard touchdown. He dropped an easy touchdown pass from Bo Nix, but redeemed himself.

Crum found the end zone from 7 yards out, catching a short pass from Nix and barreling his way into the end zone in the second quarter and was immediately swarmed by his teammates in celebration.

Kayshon Boutte was selected by the New England Patriots in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL Draft with the 187th overall pick. The wideout possessed the talent to go earlier coming out of LSU, but off-the-field issues and inconsistencies led him to fall in the draft, providing immense value for New England. Now, with a new mindset, Boutte is blossoming and shining as New England makes a Super Bowl push.

Read more on the 23-year-old receiver here from Chad Graff of The Athletic.

It’s fitting that Kayshon Boutte finished last week’s win over Houston as the game’s leading receiver, as he had the highlight of the night in New England.

Boutte’s one-handed touchdown catch to effectively seal the game in the fourth quarter will have its place in the rich playoff history of the Patriots.

All in all, Boutte finished with three catches on five targets for 75 receiving yards, highlighted by that touchdown.

Marvin Mims Jr. was injured on the opening kickoff against Buffalo last week but returned to action on the Broncos’ first possession and ended up being a critical part of Denver’s win.

The 23-year-old led the team in receiving, catching all eight of his targets for 93 yards and a touchdown. He had a batch of critical catches in key moments, none bigger than his 26-yard touchdown that gave the Broncos the lead with 55 seconds left in regulation.

Mims tracked down a beautifully thrown ball by Bo Nix, smoothly reeled in the pass over his shoulder and survived the ground for a clutch touchdown that was pivotal to Denver’s win.

Stefon Diggs has a propensity for strong games against his former teams, and that continued against the Houston Texans during the divisional round. The veteran wideout caught four passes for 40 yards in last week’s win, including an impressive touchdown snag when he was heavily contested but made a firm catch on a laser from Drake Maye.

At 32 years old, Diggs is still uber productive, displaying his quality on a weekly basis and could play a critical role this afternoon.

Broncos fans, look away! Buffalo Bills receiver Brandin Cooks believes that the controversial play that led to a Broncos interception toward the end of the AFC divisional game was indeed a catch. Here is what he said:

💬 “At the end of the day, it was a catch. Not just what it looked like, but what it felt like. When you look back at it, the time that was spent on it to review it wasn’t enough. Given the magnitude of that game and situation, it’s a little disappointing.”

Read more from our Denny Alfonso.

The Denver Broncos sealed their first AFC Championship Game appearance since 2015 with a 33-30 overtime victory over the Buffalo Bills last Saturday, but they suffered a crushing blow in the process. Quarterback Bo Nix broke a bone in his right ankle on one of the game’s final plays, knocking him out of the postseason and forcing coach Sean Payton to turn to backup Jarrett Stidham as Denver pursues a Super Bowl.

Stidham hasn’t thrown a pass in a regular-season game since the last game of the 2023 season on Jan. 7, 2024. Stidham has just four career NFL starts, so it will be a tall task for him to win two playoff games. But he is far from the first quarterback to attempt this feat.

In fact, several backup signal callers have succeeded in taking their teams to the Super Bowl following midseason injuries to starters. Many inherited situations that were far worse than what Stidham is facing. It’s worth noting that Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks like Doug Williams and Trent Dilfer were not eligible for this list, as they took over due to poor play rather than an injury. That being said, here are some of the most prominent examples of backups who didn’t miss a beat when called upon.

Last week, after the news of Bo Nix’s season-ending ankle injury, Nick Foles took to social media to show support for the Broncos and troll the Patriots, posting this on on social media:

✍️ “Note for the Broncos and their fans: I know it has been an emotional 24 hours. I feel for Bo and the team, and I’m sending prayers for a strong recovery.

“A positive note going into the game versus the Patriots is that they struggle against backup QBs in championship-type games.”

Bo Nix suffered a heartbreaking ankle injury that ended his season before the Broncos take the field in the AFC Championship Game. The Denver QB took to Instagram to express how hard these last few days have been and his faith in backup Jarrett Stidham.

✍️ “The last few days have been hard to put into words,” Nix wrote in a message posted to Instagram. “What started as one of the most exciting games I’ve ever been a part of ended with some of the most devastating football news I’ve ever received. This is not how I imagined my season would come to an end, but our season has been defined by overcoming adversity and responding to it.”

Jarrett Stidham will be the starting quarterback for the Denver Broncos in today’s AFC Championship Game. Before Bo Nix’s injury last week, it appeared Stidham would be on the bench in a conference championship game. Now, unusual circumstances have him under center in Denver’s biggest game of the year.

Here is our Nick Kosmider on why Stidham has always been prepared for this moment:

📝 “Now, Stidham is at the front of the room, a starting quarterback for a team one win away from the Super Bowl. A sold-out Empower Field at Mile High will be a long way from the empty practice field in Waco, but in many ways, little has changed for Stidham since earning the unofficial title as the greatest scout-team quarterback in Texas. Payton expects the quarterback to “rip it,” just like Stidham did when he was helping a high school defense get ready for Friday nights.”

Jarrett Stidham will make his first playoff start next week in the AFC Championship after Denver Broncos starting QB Bo Nix suffered a season-ending right ankle fracture in Saturday’s Divisional Round victory over the Buffalo Bills. Stidham, 29, was selected in the fourth round of the 2019 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. He’s now in his third season with the Broncos, serving as the backup to Nix for the last two years. Stidham is 1-3 as an NFL starter and last started in 2023, when he went 1-1 over the last two games of the regular season. The veteran QB has thrown eight touchdowns against eight interceptions in 20 NFL games.

Prior to Stidham, the last three QBs to start in the AFC Championship for the Broncos were Peyton Manning, Jake Plummer and John Elway. If there is some sort of silver lining here, or really just a weird and random fact, the Broncos have never reached the Super Bowl with a QB that they've drafted. Nix, whom Denver drafted 12th in 2024, would've had a chance to be the first. For those who may be scratching their heads, here's your reminder that two-time Super Bowl champ Elway was actually drafted first in 1983 by the then-Baltimore Colts and subsequently traded to the Broncos after Elway refused to play for the Colts.

With a strong performance filled with big-time plays, Bo Nix earned his first career playoff win last weekend against Buffalo to advance to the AFC Championship Game, and somehow, the day ended in complete disappointment.

After being bounced by the Bills in the wild-card round a year prior, Nix threw for 279 yards and three touchdowns with one pick to avenge this loss in overtime. But on a QB sweep on the second-to-last play of the game, he suffered a fractured ankle that required season-ending surgery with the Broncos two wins away from the Super Bowl.

The Patriots’ 28-16 victory over the Texans last Sunday ensured Mike Vrabel will participate in his seventh AFC Championship Game as a player and coach. The former Patriots linebacker played in five conference championships (and ultimately won three Super Bowls).

After he retired and went into coaching, Vrabel steered the Titans to the AFC title game during his second season with the franchise in 2019, and now he’s back again in his first season as the Patriots’ coach.

For the second straight game, Drake Maye didn’t have his best stuff but was good enough to help deliver a win. The MVP candidate came back from a so-so performance against the Chargers and continued to have issues holding onto the ball behind a struggling offensive line. His four fumbles helped keep the Texans in the game last Sunday— and could have been worse if rookie tackle Will Campbell hadn’t recovered two of them.

To be fair, Maye was quite good when he had time to throw, but he struggled with holding onto the ball too long as Houston’s defensive line dominated the New England front five. His 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter helped seal the game and was perfectly thrown.

The Patriots might not need Maye’s A-game this week either, considering the backup quarterback they’ll be facing in Denver. But they’d surely like to get Maye back to playing like an MVP, even if they haven’t needed that level of play in the first two rounds of the playoffs.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/Ky1qVbaEYDcd_AXSE6OhkB0jS_1440x960.jpg",N,,2026-01-25 19:58:45.784469

Nix broke his ankle on the last drive of the Broncos' dramatic 33-30 Divisional Round overtime win against the Buffalo Bills on Saturday. He suffered the injury on a QB sweep to the left that was technically the third-to-last play of the game.

Jarrett Stidham will start Sunday for the top-seeded Broncos in the AFC Championship Game against the visiting No. 2-seeded New England Patriots.

The No. 12 overall selection of the 2014 NFL Draft, Nix, 25, has quarterbacked Denver to back-to-back playoff appearances, with Saturday's triumph standing as his first postseason victory. Nix was 26 of 46 (56.5%) for 279 yards and three touchdowns, while also rushing for 29 yards on a season-high 12 carries.

For the season, Nix completed 388 of his NFL-high 612 passing attempts for 3,931 yards, 25 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, and added 356 yards and five touchdowns rushing.

The AFC title game will be the first game missed for Nix in his short NFL career, which began with 36 straight starts, including playoffs.

Veteran backup Stidham will step in, set to make his first playoff appearance and start.

The 29-year-old Stidham was a 2019 fourth-round pick of the New England Patriots and was also with the Las Vegas Raiders before joining the Broncos. He's in his third season in head coach Sean Payton's offense, but has not started since Week 18 of the 2023 campaign when he'd been named the team's starter upon the benching of Russell Wilson.

Stidham appeared in just one game during this past regular season, which came in a Week 8 blowout of the Dallas Cowboys. He threw no passes and played four snaps. He hasn't thrown an official pass since Week 18 of the 2023 season in his aforementioned previous start.

Here are my top Kayshon Boutte prop bets for the AFC Championship Game.

Best Kayshon Boutte Prop Bets

Kayshon Boutte has played a big role in the postseason so far for the Patriots. Boutte was the deep threat for the team all season and led the team in yards per catch among players with at least 20 receptions. He ranked fifth on the team in receptions, but third on the team in receiving yards because of the number of deep balls that he caught. Against the Chargers in the Wild Card, Boutte had four catches for 66 yards. Then, against the Texans, he had three catches for 75 yards and a spectacular touchdown. As a deep-ball threat, Boutte plays a critical role for Drake Maye, but he has always been a boom-or-bust player.

My favorite Kayshon Boutte player prop is for him to have under 2.5 receptions. This Denver defense is one of the best in the league, having led the NFL in defensive dropback success rate during the regular season. The Broncos are good at taking away the deep shot, ranking fifth in the NFL in 20+ yard catches allowed. Boutte will either have to go up against Patrick Surtain II or Riley Moss in this game.

Surtain II is the best cover corner in the game. In 609 coverage snaps this season, he only gave up one 20+ yard catch, and that came on a shorter route after which the receiver broke a couple of tackles for a long gain. Surtain should completely take away Boutte when across from each other. When Boutte faces Riley Moss, Moss can match up with him as well. If Boutte ever beats Moss, he will take a penalty before giving up a long catch. The cornerback leads the NFL in defensive pass interference penalties this season. There is a chance that Boutte hits another deep ball or two in this game, but he should stay under 2.5 receptions against this elite secondary.",https://dknetwork.draftkings.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-2251889638.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 15:59:20.849165

Nix will watch the conference championship game from a luxury suite and is instructed to refrain from putting weight on his injured ankle for at least four weeks. He will not return to football activities for three months, and while that layoff will cost him a significant portion of the offseason, the expectation is that he will be mostly recovered in time to join the Broncos for OTAs and training camp.

Demand transparency: Which helmets perform best for rotational forces?","The New York Post recently reported on the death of a former NFL player and noted he suffered from CTE. Whatever the exact details of any one case, the larger point is hard to ignore: repeated head impacts can echo long after the stadium lights go off-showing up as problems with mood, impulse control, sleep, relationships, and the ability to stay stable day-to-day.

Hall of Fame linebacker Harry Carson knows this firsthand. In a FRONTLINE interview, he described the lingering effects: “Headaches. Memory. Blurred vision occasionally, processing information. A little forgetful sometimes… there are times when I feel I should be emotional about certain things… There are times when I don’t feel anything. And when I feel that lack of emotion sometimes, I think there’s something wrong here that I don’t grieve the way that most people would grieve.”

Carson added, “Knowing what I know now? You only get one brain. Once that brain gets injured, you never know how you’re going to be from that point on.”

This isn’t about blaming football. It’s about refusing to accept preventable brain trauma as “the price of admission.”

The uncomfortable truth: brain injury attacks the very skills you need to get help

One reason concussion/TBI outcomes can spiral is brutally simple: after injury, you may struggle to regulate emotions, plan your days, and make decisions-all while the world expects you to do more of those exact things (schedule appointments, advocate for yourself, follow complex instructions, stay calm, “push through”).

Former NFL running back Larry Johnson captured this internal fracture when describing his own symptoms: “One is telling you to do it; one is telling you don’t. One is telling you it’d be fun.” He’s had to create video archives of his own life just to remember who he was: “If I can’t remember who I was, I’ve got YouTube; I’ve got music videos that I’m making for myself, so when I watch these things I can remember.”

The Model Systems Knowledge Translation Center confirms what players like Johnson and Carson experience: “People with mild to severe traumatic brain injury may experience changes in mood and emotion management, including irritability, anxiety, depression, and emotional outbursts. Some may also have difficulties in controlling impulses or mood swings, and problems with sleep and fatigue.”

And it’s not just acute symptoms. Research tracking athletes seven years post-concussion found “chronically impaired attention, working memory, inhibition, and interference control”-exactly the executive functions you need to navigate recovery.

That’s why “rest and wait” has failed so many people for so long. The system was built for short-term, uncomplicated concussions in healthy athletes-not for repeated hits, persistent symptoms, or the long tail of brain injury.

Dr. John J. Leddy at the University of Buffalo put it plainly: “Our work has taken an exercise physiological approach to a neurological injury that has changed clinical treatment from a passive, strict rest approach to a prescribed active rehabilitation approach.”

Survivors deserve answers, not dismissal-and they deserve a roadmap, not random advice.

Better helmets aren’t a cure-but they’re a real, immediate lever

No helmet can fully prevent concussion (especially rotational forces). But better protective headgear can reduce impact forces and lower risk. And in a sport defined by collisions, reducing even a fraction of cumulative force matters.

Recent research on helmet technology backs this up: “Both rotational technologies resulted in lower peak rotational acceleration and brain strain… these results support the notion that a specific technology may be more effective in managing rotational acceleration under specific impact conditions. The improved protection provided supports the importance of including rotational test protocols in helmet certification standards.”

The NFL and NFLPA have started to move. For the 2025 season, seven new helmet models were released-all ranking in the “Top-Performing” category under new lab testing that measures both linear and rotational forces. Players wearing top-rated helmets had significantly lower concussion rates than those in “Lesser” helmets. Several older “Not Recommended” models were prohibited entirely.

There’s also been a shift toward position-specific helmet designs-quarterback helmets engineered differently than linemen helmets-because impact forces and types differ by role. Models like Riddell’s SpeedFlex Precision QB and the Axiom 3D QB performed best in recent testing.

Some of the newest technology includes liquid crystal elastomers-rubbery materials inside helmets that absorb and dissipate energy more effectively. And the Guardian Cap, an extra-padded cover once limited to practice, became optionally allowed in live NFL games in 2024. League data suggests it can reduce impact forces by 11-12% in helmet-to-helmet hits.

“Better” should mean:

Independent testing (not marketing)

Testing that includes rotational acceleration, not just linear hits

Transparent, public rankings (so fans/players/teams can compare)

Proper fit + replacement schedules (old, ill-fitting helmets are a safety issue)

If the league can measure everything from next-gen stats to toe-tap angles, it can demand higher helmet standards with real transparency.

The part fans can change: culture and accountability

NFL culture still rewards denial:

“He got his bell rung.”

“He’s fine.”

“Warrior.”

But the brain doesn’t care about toughness. And the people who pay later are often the ones least equipped to fight for themselves when symptoms linger.

So here’s a fan-friendly way to reframe it: You can still celebrate big hits and demand a game that doesn’t chew through human brains to entertain us.

A practical tool fans can share: the “clear communication” framework

A huge gap in brain injury recovery is communication-especially when someone is foggy, overwhelmed, or intimidated in medical settings. The best survivor-centered resources now emphasize structure: symptom logs, pacing trackers, and scripts that keep appointments focused.

If you know a current or former player (or any athlete) dealing with lingering symptoms, share this simple approach for medical visits:

The 60-second opening script

“Before we begin, I’d like to share a one-minute summary of my main symptoms and goals so we can stay focused.”

Key sentences that help when you’re overwhelmed

“Can you explain this in plain language?”

“I’m having trouble following-can you repeat that slowly?”

“Can we focus on one issue at a time?”

“What are my top priorities right now?”

“What should I NOT be doing?”

“Can I have written instructions?”

Close the appointment with clarity

“What are my next 1–2 steps?”

“When should I follow up?”

“What symptoms should I watch for?”

This matters because when your brain is struggling, clarity and sequencing aren’t “nice”-they’re treatment.

The Four-Pillar self-check (simple, actionable)

One of the most helpful ideas in modern TBI recovery resources is a short weekly reset-questions that reduce overwhelm and restore control:

What one action can I take this week to support recovery?

What is NOT needed right now? (cut noise, reduce crashes)

Who can help me stay on track? (advocate, friend, caregiver)

What’s my plan to communicate clearly at appointments? (notes, written instructions, symptom log)

That’s not “soft.” That’s how you keep someone from getting lost in the cracks.

What’s working now: the recovery revolution

While helmet technology and cultural shifts matter, some of the most exciting developments are happening in how we assess and treat brain injuries after they occur.

Virtual reality is changing assessment and rehabilitation

Johns Hopkins researchers developed a VR game that transforms routine clinical tests-memory, reaction time, attention-into engaging tasks that give clinicians objective data for return-to-play decisions, moving beyond athletes’ self-reports.

Penn State is using a fully immersive VR environment with 12×10 foot screens, balance platforms, and EEG to establish baseline metrics in athletes and track how they change after injury. This catches cognitive changes invisible on standard tests.

In 2025, a Division I football player with multiple concussions completed a 10-week VR balance training program. Not only did his balance and dizziness improve-so did his mood and cognition. Reviews from 2023-2024 show that VR interventions for vestibular dysfunction, balance, and gait tend to perform at least as well as traditional therapy, and often better at keeping people engaged and achieving steady gains.

Precision measurement is getting personal

A 2025 study introduced instrumented headbands using multiple sensors and advanced signal processing to track rotational acceleration and velocity during impacts. While still being refined for off-axis hits, the technology shows promise for tracking cumulative head load outside formal game or lab settings-giving athletes and teams real-time data on brain stress.

Alternative approaches are emerging (with caution)

There’s growing interest among current and former NFL players in psychedelics like ayahuasca and psilocybin. Some report improvements in mood, identity, and emotional regulation. Researchers are exploring whether these substances can reduce brain inflammation or promote neuroplasticity-helping the brain rewire itself. But as of now, evidence is mostly anecdotal or preliminary. It’s not standardized or approved for clinical use.

What’s still missing

Long-term outcome studies for newer treatments remain scarce. We don’t yet have standardized protocols for VR rehab-how much, how often, what intensity. And many recovery programs still focus on acute symptom relief rather than comprehensive support for planning, day-to-day management, and long-term cognitive and emotional health.

But the direction is clear: from passive rest to active rehabilitation, from self-reporting to objective measurement, from one-size-fits-all to personalized, position-specific, technology-enhanced care.

What NFL fans can do this week (one concrete action)

Pick one:

Ask your team/beat reporters to cover helmet testing standards the way they cover combine metrics. Demand transparency: Which helmets perform best for rotational forces? What’s the replacement schedule?

Support organizations and reporting that push independent concussion research and player aftercare (not PR).

Stop glorifying obvious head trauma on replay. It sounds small, but culture changes faster than policy-and the league follows culture.

If we’re going to call football “family,” then we have to act like it: protect the people who make the sport possible, before and after Sundays.

WR Pat Bryant, Denver Broncos vs. NE ($4,400)

Lost in the shuffle of a dramatic Broncos win last week was the play of Pat Bryant. The wide receiver snagged three catches for 32 yards in the first quarter alone. However, a concussion moments later ended his day before halftime. That level of production, while a small sample size, is difficult to ignore. The rookie has come on strong in recent weeks, emerging as a reliable pass catcher for Denver. He’s tallied at least four receptions in four of his last six appearances. That includes last weekend’s injury-shortened outing vs. Buffalo.

Going up against a stout Patriots defense is a challenge on its own. Doing so with backup Jarrett Stidham ($4,500) under center makes things even more difficult. Regardless, that also increases the likelihood that the Broncos find themselves trailing. Should that occur, they’ll need to throw the ball more than usual. It’s also worth noting that New England has surrendered 17 touchdowns to wide receivers. That’s tied for the seventh-highest mark in football. Even if Bryant doesn’t reach the end zone, he should remain productive this afternoon.

RB George Holani, Seattle Seahawks vs. LAR ($4,000)

In a devastating blow for the Seahawks, Zach Charbonnet suffered a season-ending knee injuryopens in a new tab last Saturday vs. San Francisco. As a result, Kenneth Walker III ($6,200) is expected to gobble up most of the touches for Seattle. Still, there’s room for more than one running back to produce tonight. If anyone else is going to get some carries, it’s likely George Holani. The second-year pro has done most of his work on special teams. Still, through 11 games he’s recorded 24 touches for 88 total yards and a touchdown.

That’s not much of a track record to go off of, but it’s something. No other healthy running back besides Walker has handled more than five carries for Seattle. The Rams are no pushovers up front; at this point in the postseason, nobody is. Still, there should be some room to operate in the run game. In addition, Los Angeles has given up the NFL’s fifth-most receiving yards (650) to opposing running backs. Given the lack of low-cost options at the position, Holani could be a worthwhile dart throw.

TE Colby Parkinson, Los Angeles Rams at SEA ($3,500)

We’ll stay in the Pacific Northwest, where the Rams are hoping to pick up a road win. That won’t be easy against an elite Seahawks defense. This is a true battle of strength against strength; Seattle’s secondary vs. Los Angeles’ passing game. Quarterback Matthew Stafford ($6,300) has forged impressive connections with wideouts Puka Nacua ($9,000) and Davante Adams ($6,000). However, against a defense of this caliber, it’s unrealistic to expect both players to dominate. Should that occur, another target might emerge for LA.

The likeliest candidate would be Colby Parkinson. When healthy, the sixth-year pro has established himself as Los Angeles’ leading tight end. Through 15 games this season, the veteran has recorded 43 catches for 408 yards and eight touchdowns. If there’s any weakness on this Seahawks defense, its over the middle. Seattle is giving up the tenth-most fantasy points to opposing tight ends. Parkinson has tallied at least 11.0 fantasy points in three of his last four outings. A similar showing on Sunday would be a welcome sight for fantasy managers.",https://dknetwork.draftkings.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-2247620782.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 14:59:27.286350

Darnold's availability for the contest was never really in question after he was listed as limited in practice all week and was not given an injury designation before the game. But his level of participation in practices suggests the issue may be more serious than it appears.

Darnold reportedly split time with backup Drew Lock in practice during the week. The Seahawks were careful with the starter, not allowing Darnold to throw it deep in practices. The quarterback is reportedly saving those types of throws for Sunday's game, per Schefter.

Darnold attempted only short and medium throws at practice and did not, as one source described, ""let it rip."" He is saving that level of throwing effort for Sunday's game against the Los Angeles Rams.

The 28-year-old Darnold initially sustained the injury ahead of the team's divisional round game against the San Francisco 49ers. Despite the injury, Darnold was able to play against the 49ers, where he helped lead the team to a dominant 41-6 win.

Darnold wasn't asked to do much in the victory. With the Seahawks jumping out to a 17-0 lead in the first quarter, Darnold threw the ball only 17 times throughout the contest. After the Seahawks essentially clinched the game, Lock came on in relief of Darnold. Lock, however, did not throw a pass during the contest.

While it's unclear how Darnold will respond if pushed into more action against the Rams on Sunday, the quarterback plans to take a pain-killing injection prior to the game, per Schefter. He did the same thing before the team's divisional round game and it helped.

The 25-year-old's season ended in heartbreaking fashion last weekend as he engineered a victory over the Buffalo Bills, but broke his ankle in the process.

ESPN reported on Sunday morning that Nix has now undergone a successful surgery, and has been given a 12-week recovery timetable that sets him up to be fully healthy well before the start of next season.

Adam Schefter reports that Nix has been told he can't put any weight on his ankle for at least the next four weeks, but he is understood to be planning to attend Sunday's game to watch in a VIP suite alongside his fellow injured Broncos players.

There had been some bizarre speculation that Nix could return in time for the Super Bowl should the Broncos win today, but that has been put to bed with the latest update about his ankle surgery.

Nix suffered the injury late in overtime of the win over the Bills, with Jarrett Stidham soon named the starter for the AFC Championship Game.

The injury marks the third time Nix has broken his ankle playing football, but this time it was in a different spot and doctors have told him there is 'nothing to be concerned about long-term,' per ESPN sources.

It is understood that the recovery for Nix's injury is likely to be far worse that the surgery itself, with Broncos trainers putting together a thorough off-season program to get him back to full health.

Stidham now has the full backing of the Broncos team and front office heading into their do-or-die game on Sunday, with Sean Payton quick to tell reporters that he believes in his back-up QB.

Unfortunately, Nix will not play today against the Patriots in the AFC Championship. Instead, the Broncos will start veteran Jarrett Stidham at quarterback.

Sam Ehilinger moves up from the emergency signal-caller to the team’s backup quarterback in Nix’s absence. Nix is sidelined for the remainder of Denver’s season and would not play in the Super Bowl, even if Denver tops New England.

All signs point to Stidham being the Broncos starting quarterback for the remainder of the season.

Here’s what you need to know about Nix’s injury.

Bo Nix’s Injury: Here’s What Happened to the Broncos QB & Potential Return Timeline

Broncos head coach Sean Payton revealed that Nix sustained the injury on the second to last offensive play during Denver’s win over Buffalo. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Nix’s return timeline in 12 weeks, which cements his status as out, even if the Broncos reach the Super Bowl.

“Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, who is out for Sunday’s AFC Championship game against the New England Patriots, is expected to be sidelined 12 weeks after undergoing surgery last week on his broken right ankle, sources told ESPN,” Schefter detailed in a January 25, 2026, story titled, “Sources: Broncos’ Bo Nix sidelined 12 weeks after ankle surgery.”

“The recovery, not the surgery, is thought to be the most challenging part of this injury. Nix is not supposed to put any weight on his ankle for at least four weeks, and he will miss 12 weeks altogether before he can return to activity, according to sources.”

Will Bo Nix Play in the Super Bowl if the Broncos Defeat the Patriots in the AFC Championship?

Nix will not play in the AFC Championship or the Super Bowl (if Denver advances), but it is not all bad news. If Schefter’s timeline comes to fruition, Nix will be more than ready for the start of next NFL season.

This also means Nix should be healthy for Denver’s offseason workouts. Stidham is expected to serve as Denver’s starting quarterback for the remainder of the season. Broncos fans hope this also means the Super Bowl.

Jarrett Stidham Is the Broncos Starting Quarterback With Sam Ehilinger as Denver’s Backup QB

It is surprising news as Nix was not sidelined during the Broncos’ win over the Bills. Nix participated in a postgame interview, and Payton also conducted his normal press conference.

Minutes later, Payton called an impromptu second press conference revealing that Nix sustained a season-ending injury and named Stidham the starter moving forward.

“I know how he was coached in New England,” Payton said of Stidham, per ESPN. “I know exactly how he was coached in New England.

“And then I know how [Patriots offensive coordinator Josh] McDaniels felt about him … but ultimately … it’s our three years here, our three years watching him day in and day out. He will be ready to go.”",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2253054741_e5a222-e1769345833814.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-25 13:59:33.698150

With a strong performance filled with big-time plays, Bo Nix earned his first career playoff win last weekend against Buffalo to advance to the AFC Championship Game, and somehow, the day ended in complete disappointment.

After being bounced by the Bills in the wild-card round a year prior, Nix threw for 279 yards and three touchdowns with one pick to avenge this loss in overtime. But on a QB sweep on the second-to-last play of the game, he suffered a fractured ankle that required season-ending surgery with the Broncos two wins away from the Super Bowl.

The Patriots’ 28-16 victory over the Texans last Sunday ensured Mike Vrabel will participate in his seventh AFC Championship Game as a player and coach. The former Patriots linebacker played in five conference championships (and ultimately won three Super Bowls).

After he retired and went into coaching, Vrabel steered the Titans to the AFC title game during his second season with the franchise in 2019, and now he’s back again in his first season as the Patriots’ coach.

For the second straight game, Drake Maye didn’t have his best stuff but was good enough to help deliver a win. The MVP candidate came back from a so-so performance against the Chargers and continued to have issues holding onto the ball behind a struggling offensive line. His four fumbles helped keep the Texans in the game last Sunday— and could have been worse if rookie tackle Will Campbell hadn’t recovered two of them.

To be fair, Maye was quite good when he had time to throw, but he struggled with holding onto the ball too long as Houston’s defensive line dominated the New England front five. His 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter helped seal the game and was perfectly thrown.

The Patriots might not need Maye’s A-game this week either, considering the backup quarterback they’ll be facing in Denver. But they’d surely like to get Maye back to playing like an MVP, even if they haven’t needed that level of play in the first two rounds of the playoffs.

The Patriots’ defense was solid during the regular season. It wasn’t bad, but it was certainly the weaker side of the ball as the team’s offense dominated throughout. But in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the New England defense is playing like one of the best units in the NFL.

After holding Justin Herbert and the Chargers to three points in last weekend’s wild-card round, the Patriots notched a pick six last Sunday, intercepted C.J. Stroud four times and scooped up a fumble to put the final tally at five turnovers.

Most importantly, they had Stroud in a blender throughout. Defensive play caller Zak Kuhr dialed up another impressive game plan and put together a package of blitzes that had the Houston quarterback looking flummoxed from the get-go.

Houston managed just 3.3 yards per play and was unable to get anything going on the ground.

The Patriots’ defense seems to be peaking at the right time and is absolutely rolling heading into the AFC Championship Game.

There were many Broncos fans in April who believed Ja’Quan McMillian may be headed out the door — or at least headed to the bench. When the Broncos drafted defensive back Jahdae Barron with their first-round pick, it appeared they were drafting a new nickel for coordinator Vance Joseph’s defense. McMillian responded by turning in the best training camp of his career and his best season to follow. In a season of huge plays for the former undrafted defensive back, though, none was better than his jaw-dropping interception of Josh Allen on a deep ball in overtime.

Allen, trying to blast the Bills into range for a game-winning field goal, threw deep for Brandin Cooks, who appeared to have a step on McMillian. But McMillian closed on the ball and then ripped the ball out of Cook’s hands to give the Broncos the ball. It was the fifth takeaway of the game for the Broncos, who only produced 14 turnovers during the regular season. It was a reminder, as if Broncos fans needed another one, that McMillian has been indispensable for this team — and a major reason they are one win from the Super Bowl.

In a thrilling game at Empower Field at Mile High, the Denver Broncos advanced to the AFC Championship Game with a 33-30 win over the Buffalo Bills in overtime but lost quarterback Bo Nix for the remainder of the season in the process. Nix suffered a broken ankle on the second-to-last play of the game, minutes before Wil Lutz’s game-winning field goal.

Denver’s defense forced five turnovers, including four by Josh Allen (two fumbles and two interceptions), after he had just 14 during the regular season. There was also a controversial interception by Ja’Quan McMillian in overtime, as he ripped the ball away from Brandin Cooks.

The New England Patriots’ defense has taken its play to another level in the postseason, and that was on full display against the Houston Texans last week at Gillette Stadium, allowing just 241 yards of offense and forcing five turnovers. Carlon Davis III intercepted C.J. Stroud twice, and Marcus Jones took his pick off the Texans quarterback to the house for a score.

Drake Maye threw three touchdown passes, but he fumbled four times, although he lost just two of them. Despite being a bit too loose with the ball, the second-year quarterback continues to impress with his poise, accuracy and command of the offense. Kayshon Boutte, Demario Douglas and Stefon Diggs all caught touchdowns.

The new year of 2026 is here, and it’s an amazing time to be a sports fan. The NFL Playoffs are near their conclusion, with Super Bowl LX on the horizon. The Winter Olympics from Milano-Cortina are a few weeks away. The NBA and NHL seasons are in full swing. Don‘t forget about Champions League and the EPL.

McGinn had undergone scans in the past week to learn the extent of the injury after being forced off in the 31st minute in Villa’s 1-0 defeat to Everton last Sunday.

While Villa waited for a prognosis for the Scotland international, they moved to help bolster midfield and wide areas, with Leon Bailey returning from his loan spell at AS Roma and Harvey Elliott being recalled to the squad for the trip to Newcastle United on Sunday.

Provided the outlined timeframe is followed, McGinn should have recovered in time for the World Cup, which Scotland will be playing in for the first time in 28 years.

The 31-year-old, though, will miss a crucial run of fixtures for his club side, particularly with injuries mounting in midfield.

Boubacar Kamara has been ruled out for the remainder of the campaign, while Ross Barkley has not yet returned to full training.

This has influenced Villa to assess the transfer window and possible midfield loan options. Ruben Loftus-Cheek is among a list of players being considered, but will also depend on how much financial scope Villa have to do business, in light of ongoing restrictions.

McGinn has made 29 appearances for Villa this season, scoring five goals and registering four assists.

The recovery, not the surgery, is thought to be the most challenging part of this injury. Nix is not supposed to put any weight on his ankle for at least four weeks, and he will miss 12 weeks altogether before he can return to activity, according to sources.

This eliminates any notion, far-fetched as it was, that Nix could somehow pull a miraculous return for the Feb. 8 Super Bowl LX in the event that Denver does advance.

During Sunday's AFC Championship Game at Empower Field at Mile High in Denver, Nix will be in a box with other injured Broncos, off his feet as doctors have instructed him to be.

Nix is expected to be largely recovered in time to participate in the Broncos' offseason program, but doctors are trying to be very intentional with what Denver's quarterback can and can't do over the next 12 weeks.

Nix suffered the injury late in overtime of the Broncos' victory over the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round. Broncos coach Sean Payton delivered the news in the aftermath of the game and immediately named Jarrett Stidham as the starting quarterback for the AFC Championship Game.

This marks the third time that Nix has broken his ankle playing football, but this break was in a different spot and doctors have told him that the injury is ""nothing to be concerned about long term,"" according to a source.

In the short term, the Broncos are replacing Nix with Stidham, who was the first free agent that Payton signed after he accepted Denver's head coaching job.

""I'm not worried about Stiddy in this game,"" Payton told reporters Friday. ""I'm worried about everyone else and how we play. That really is the truth.""

Broncos Country also has publicly backed Stidham, with thousands of fans changing their social media avatars to photos of Stidham wearing sunglasses and earbuds. The picture is visible this week all over social media.

But while Stidham makes his first start of the season, Nix will miss the AFC Championship Game and a showdown against his good friend and quarterback draft classmate Drake Maye. The two quarterbacks have spent countless hours training together during the offseason, largely at Philip Rivers' training complex in Fairhope, Alabama.

Bo Nix was ruled out for the rest of the season after sustaining a broken ankle on one of the final plays during the team's divisional round win over the Buffalo Bills.

Nix, 25, was ruled out shortly after that win, with head coach Sean Payton announcing the quarterback was injured on the second-to-last play in the team's overtime victory. Nix was slated to have season-ending surgery a few days later, but his injury timeline wasn't revealed until Sunday.

After undergoing that surgery, the quarterback is expected to miss 12 weeks, per ESPN's Adam Schefter. Nix reportedly will not be allowed to be any weight on his ankle for four weeks. If he recovers well, the earliest he can begin activity would be right around the 12-week mark.

Though it's going to be a lengthy recovery, Nix is expected to be ""largely recovered"" in time for the team's offseason workouts, per Schefter.

Nix has reportedly broken his ankle three times during his football career, though this break is in a different area and should not affect the quarterback long term. Nix has gotten off to a promising start in his career, and threw for 3,931 yards, with 25 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, during his second season in the NFL. His performance, combined with the Broncos' excellent defense, resulted in Denver winning the No. 1 seed in the AFC.

Seattle also activated running back George Holani off injured reserve on Friday.

Brock: Seahawks must speed up Stafford to slow down Rams

Holani, Jones and Akers give the Seahawks a trio of options behind top running back Kenneth Walker III in the wake of Zach Charbonnet’s season-ending injury. Charbonnet, the team’s second-leading rusher, suffered a torn ACL in last weekend’s 41-6 divisional round rout of the San Francisco 49ers.

Jones, a fourth-year pro who signed with Seattle’s practice squad midway through the season, rushed for 32 yards on four carries in three regular-season games. He was elevated from the practice squad for the divisional round game and ran for 10 yards on six carries after Charbonnet went down.

Akers, a sixth-year pro, signed with the Seahawks in late November after being released by the Minnesota Vikings. He spent his first three-plus seasons with the Rams, finishing as their leading rusher in both 2020 and 2022. He has no carries with Seattle this season, but had two kick returns for 54 yards in a Week 17 win over the Carolina Panthers.

Holani, an undrafted second-year pro out of Boise State, had been on IR since suffering a hamstring injury in Week 12. Prior to that, he spent the first 11 games as Seattle’s third-string running back behind Walker and Charbonnet. Holani rushed for 73 yards and a TD on 22 carries, while adding two catches for 15 yards and 16 kick returns for 387 yards.

Walker rushed for a team-high 1,027 yards and five touchdowns in the regular season, then ran for 116 yards and three TDs in the Seahawks’ playoff rout of the 49ers. Charbonnet rushed for 730 yards and a team-high 12 TDs in the regular season.

In the NFL, players such as Green Bay Packers wide receiver Romeo Doubs wear the guardian cap in the game.
It can be harder at the high school level, where parents are much more involved.
Former NFL players such as Aaron Hernandez, the former UF and New England Patriots tight end, have been found to have had CTE.
The NFL making these choices has had a trickle-down effect to lower levels of football, from college to high school and beyond.","The scariest injury in football isn’t a torn anterior cruciate ligament or a ruptured Achilles. Instead, it is an injury that is not always even seen. There is nothing in football that can compare to a concussion.

A concussion occurs when the brain moves rapidly back and forth in the skull, usually after a hit or collision. In football, there are hits every single play, bringing the risk of a concussion even higher. Sometimes it is clear a concussion has occurred, such as when Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was left twitching on the field in Week 4 of the 2022 season. Other times it is not as clear and a player may remain in the game.

The NFL has begun to be more proactive when it comes to concussions. It has implemented things such as the guardian cap, which is a protective cover over the helmet, as well as changing kickoff rules to avoid unnecessary high speed collisions.

So far, it is working. The NFL reported a drop in total concussions in 2024, going from 219 in 2023 to just 182 in 2024, per Kevin Seifert of ESPN. The biggest change came from regular-season games, where the concussion numbers went from 152 to 129.

I had the opportunity to talk with former offensive lineman and current high school football coach at Land O’ Lakes high school Dan Goodspeed, as well as Ben Fisher, an intern athletic trainer at the University of Florida, to learn more about concussions in football. Goodspeed was a member of the 2003 Super Bowl winning Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Rub Some Dirt on it

Goodspeed played offensive line in the NFL from 2001-2005 and spent time in the CFL and XFL up until 2012. “It was a very different time for concussions,” he said.

While Goodspeed was knocked out on the field multiple times, there was not a concussion diagnosis that followed. Instead, he would receive smelling salts to wake up and be sent back out.

There was the expectation that a player would be on the field, and, if you were missing time for a concussion that meant your job was in jeopardy.

As an offensive lineman, Goodspeed had more of his head injuries coming from getting kneed in a pile rather than hitting the ground. He theorized that quarterbacks have a higher concussion rate in the regular season because they are not taking hits in practice like everyone else.

When it comes to why the concussions rate is higher in preseason, especially preseason practices, Goodspeed pointed out those practices are harder, as well as the fact that there are young players who want to earn a roster spot. These young players are hitting like it is a real game to show they have what it takes, while also being more reckless to do everything they can to achieve the dream of playing in the NFL.

Guardian Caps

All levels of football have begun to implement the guardian caps, and the data is supporting their continued use. Goodspeed, who still receives information from the NFL Players Association, passed along that the data given shows “it (guardian caps) does help.”

Goodspeed has all of his high school players wear the guardian caps. He wants the parents of his players to know that he has the safety of players in the forefront of his mind, and is taking every step to keep them healthy.

At the high school level players’ brains are still developing, which makes a concussion have even worse effects. The guardian caps are a step to mitigate the concern.

The Gators are also taking concussions seriously. While tight end Tony Livingston became the first UF player to wear the guardian cap in game, Fisher reported that all players wear them in practice. Working to decrease the risk of a concussion in practice is an easy step many college programs are taking.

In the NFL, players such as Green Bay Packers wide receiver Romeo Doubs wear the guardian cap in the game. The response by the fans was interesting. When Doubs first wore the cap, fans on social media had a field day making fun of the way it looked. But now, it is talked about less and less, which is a win for all the guardian cap supporters.

You Have a Concussion, Now What?

Concussion protocol has taken strides in the direction of player safety. The one thing that remains constant, and will likely never change, is that concussion treatment depends on a strong relationship between player and coaching staff.

The return from concussion protocol “requires honesty from the athletes” according to Fisher. The medical team cannot see inside the mind of players and know how their head feels. A positive relationship with the coaching staff allows a player to wait until they feel healthy before returning to play.

This is the type of environment Goodspeed has tried to create at Land O’ Lakes. It can be harder at the high school level, where parents are much more involved. Many parents grew up in the same era Goodspeed did, where concussions were not treated as a serious issue.

There are times where the parents will encourage their son to get back on the field, and tell the coach they are healthy when they are not.This is where things such as the concussion test come in. Players at the beginning of the season take the test to generate a baseline score, and then will take the test again if a concussion is suspected. While not perfect, it allows another check on what could be a dangerous head injury.

There are ways the athletes are able to stay in shape while sidelined with a concussion. Players can do activities such as running on the treadmill, and also begin other rehab activities as time goes by, according to Fisher.

Something to watch long term after a concussion is the onset of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, more commonly known as CTE. While it has recently become the subject of jokes across media, it is a serious condition which can be caused by traumatic brain injuries, such as concussions.

CTE is particularly scary because it takes impact years after the head injury has occurred, and cannot be detected until after death. Former NFL players such as Aaron Hernandez, the former UF and New England Patriots tight end, have been found to have had CTE. By taking steps to increase player safety in the realm of concussion, the NFL is hoping to cut down on players being found to have had CTE after death.

The NFL making these choices has had a trickle-down effect to lower levels of football, from college to high school and beyond. The NFL’s continued commitment to combatting concussions is admirable, and to look back at how far it has come since the early 2000s gives hope to the future stars.",https://www.wruf.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/USATSI_27658777-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-25 13:00:28.068910

It is Arne Slot’s side’s seventh league defeat of the season, and their fifth league match without a win.

The Athletic’s Gregg Evans assesses the action…

Just how damaging is this for Liverpool?

Forget the 13-game unbeaten run coming to an end.

The most significant statistic is that Liverpool have now failed to win any of their last five Premier League games.

That is made worse by the level of opponent: Bournemouth, Burnley, Arsenal, Fulham and Leeds United. For the Premier League champions to be so poor over that period is both shocking and surprising. And although this was the first defeat, the disappointing draws of previous weeks felt just as bad.

Slot has shared supporters’ frustrations in recent times, admitting that results against lower-placed teams have not been acceptable.

Injuries have certainly played a part and Liverpool’s rotten run of luck shows no sign of ending. They were a man down in defence and while trying to make a substitution to replace the injured Joe Gomez, they conceded the second goal. With literally the last kick of the game they painfully conceded again.

But the bottom line is that the team has not performed well enough when it matters, and victories have been so hard to come by.

Whether that’s through missing big chances or individual errors like Van Dijk’s costly mistake today, the shortcomings have resulted in a weak defence of the title. But the season is far from over, and Liverpool appear to be better suited to European football and their Champions League adventure is still alive and kicking.

They’re going to need to step up in the Premier League, though, as a top-five finish is not guaranteed in this type of form.

Is Szoboszlai now Liverpool’s main man?

Szoboszlai is quickly turning into Liverpool’s main man. He pushed and probed and almost became the saviour.

The Hungarian, who is in talks with the club about extending his contract, provided a goal and an assist and was once again the leading force as he mixed guts with guile in tricky conditions.

His attacking moments will stand out, especially the equalising strike from another free-kick (this time with a little help from Alexis Mac Allister who rolled the ball into his path) but his driving runs in midfield and all-action performance was worth so much more, even in defeat.

On one occasion where Liverpool lost possession in a dangerous area, it was Szoboszlai who raced back and charged into a tackle to cut out the counter-attack.

His pinpoint corner before half time was perfectly-weighted and allowed Van Dijk to head home. Then, late into the second half, he smashed in the equaliser, just days after scoring the opening from a free-kick against Marseille. It looked to have salvaged a point.

Ultimately it was not to be, but that wasn’t down to Szoboszlai. There’s a reason that he plays almost every minute as his status in this team continues to grow. It’s been a wild month with errors against Barnsley in the FA Cup and then the missed penalty against Burnley last weekend, but in the days that have followed he’s done everything in his powers to make amends.

How unlucky is Joe Gomez?

Injury-prone Gomez lasted just 27 minutes on his first start in the Premier League at centre-back for 13 months, leaving Liverpool significantly short on numbers in defence.

With Ibrahima Konate granted additional time off following the passing of his father, Gomez continued to fill in alongside Van Dijk and was playing well until another cruel setback.

In the build-up to Bournemouth’s opening goal, the defender collided with goalkeeper Alisson and was forced off injured.

That left Liverpool with Van Dijk as the only available centre-back, as makeshift stopper, Wataru Endo, was called upon from the bench for his first Premier League minutes in seven weeks.

Keeping Gomez fit has been a troublesome task for years and this felt particularly harsh. He was handling the demands just fine until the setback and now he will be assessed to see the extent of the damage.

What also makes the injury so disappointing was that the last time he started in his favoured position away at West Ham United in December 2024, he was also forced off through injury in the first half. The amount of minutes he’s missed through injury is heartbreaking, and at a time where Liverpool really needed him in Konate’s absence, his body again let him down.

What did Slot say?

“It’s frustrating, conceding a goal with no time left is always frustrating. They could have scored earlier.

“It’s safe to say we had a few players who ran out of energy. I cannot even criticise them for that because two days ago we had an away game in Europe.

“We’re the only team who played Champions League that has only two days in-between. I mainly played the same players because of the amount that we have available. Then you have to go and win in the end. That’s then more difficult. The rest of the game was completely different, we dominated.”

What next for Liverpool?",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/24143607/GettyImages-2257980981-scaled-e1769283391722.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-25 13:00:32.304490

Miami is expected to promote senior passing game coordinator Bobby Slowik to be its next offensive coordinator, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Saturday afternoon.

Slowik, 38, joined the Dolphins in the 2025 offseason after he served the previous two seasons as the Houston Texans offensive coordinator.

During his time as the OC in Houston, Slowik helped Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud to a stellar rookie season in 2023, leading to an AFC South division title, a Divisional Round appearance and an Offensive Rookie of the Year award for Stroud. Slowik called plays for a top-12 overall unit and seventh-ranked passing offense in 2023.

In his second season with the Texans, Slowik's offense took a dip with injuries piling up on the offensive line and inconsistent play from Stroud. Houston dropped to 22nd in total yards per game and 21st in passing, which led to his firing.

New Dolphins head coach Jeff Hafley hopes Slowik can bring the same success he saw in Year 1 with Stroud. The Dolphins currently are evaluating the quarterback position after Tua Tagovailoa was benched late in the 2025 season by former head coach Mike McDaniel.

Tagovailoa, who signed a four-year, 212.4 million contract extension in July 2024, could be looking for a fresh start elsewhere with a new regime in Miami.

Rookie Quinn Ewers showed some flashes while starting the last three games of the season, but with a new front office and head coach, the Dolphins could look to add a veteran QB this offseason or select a rookie in the 2026 NFL Draft in April.

Miami has solid a piece for Slowik to scheme around in running back De’Von Achane, who recently earned his first Pro Bowl honor. However, the Dolphins' receiving corps took a step back and has some uncertainties in the wake of Tyreek Hill suffering a season-ending knee injury in September.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/kjda7pvx1h0serm7pd8s,N,,2026-01-25 12:01:41.052475

They activated wide receiver Mack Hollins from injured reserve Saturday after he missed Weeks 17 and 18 and their pair of opening postseason games with an abdomen injury, giving star quarterback Drake Maye another key wideout in addition to Stefon Diggs and Kayshon Boutte.

At the time of his injury, Hollins had collected the third-most receptions (46) and the fourth-most receiving yards (550) on the Patriots — putting him in position to potentially surpass his previous career-bests of 57 and 690, respectively, from 2022 when he was with the Raiders.

The abdominal injury occurred during the Patriots’ Week 16 win over the Ravens, when Hollins caught seven passes for 69 yards.

Hollins, Maye said, has been “awesome” for the Patriots, while head coach Mike Vrabel, according to ESPN, told reporters that Hollins “has an energy to him.”

“It’s been awesome having him back,” Maye told reporters Friday, according to MassLive. “He’s a great player for us, been a great player for us all year. He practices hard. He’s one of those guys that brings it every day and has ever since I met him. I know he started off in OTAs and training camp battling a little injury, but since then, he’s been all gas, no brakes, and that’s how he is.

“He’s staying, running routes after practice. He’s doing all the little things. I always see him before the games on Saturday nights, drawing every single play up in the pass plays. He does those things, and you can tell why so many different teams wanted him and how he plays at a high level.”

With a win Sunday against the Broncos and backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham, Hollins would secure a spot in the second Super Bowl of his career, and this time, it’d come with the Patriots team he — and the Eagles — defeated in February 2018.

He logged 17 offensive snaps and one special teams snap during the game when another backup signal-caller — Nick Foles — threw for 373 yards, three touchdowns and an interception to power Philadelphia’s offense.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-i0ily9zwl-1769295544202.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1769277564&w=1200,N,,2026-01-25 12:01:45.431402

On Saturday, the Patriots activated WR Mack Hollins (abdomen) from injured reserve and elevated RB D'Ernest Johnson and DT Leonard Taylor III from the practice squad for Sunday's championship game. Hollins is set to make his return from a four-game absence after sustaining an injury in the Patriots Week 16 win over the Ravens. To make room for Hollins on the 53-man roster, the Patriots placed DT Eric Gregory on injured reserve. Gregory was inactive for the first two playoff games, with Taylor getting the nod to provide depth on the interior defensive line.

Starting with the Patriots offense, Hollins should provide a huge boost to the Patriots offense for the AFC Championship Game. Before his injury, the veteran led all Patriots wideouts in snaps (657), was third on the team in receptions (46), and fourth in receiving yards (550). Along with being a quarterback-friendly target for Drake Maye, Hollins was a key piece in New England's run game, allowing the Patriots to run effectively out of their three-receiver groupings because Hollins (6-4, 221) can block like a tight end.

Hollins often blocks linebackers and safeties at the point of attack in the run game, aligning on the wing or in the slot. On top of having good size and versatility, Hollins still has the play speed of a wide receiver, making the Patriots three-receiver sets more dynamic than their heavy groupings. Hollins' production might not jump off the page, but the flexibility that he brings to the table was part of the reason why the Patriots led the NFL in offensive efficiency during the regular season (first in EPA per play). Plus, the veteran is a trusted pass-catcher, using his catch radius and savvy to be a friendly target for Maye, especially over the middle of the field.

As for the Patriots practice squad elevations, New England is sticking with the same script as its first two playoff games. Johnson has been elevated from the practice squad to serve as the third back and a kickoff returner, while Taylor has been active as the fifth option in the Patriots defensive tackle rotation. Despite only playing 14 snaps last week, Taylor logged two hurries in New England's divisional round win over the Texans – solid production for a depth player.

Although they're both eligible to be activated at any time, the Patriots opted to not activate RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) or DT Joshua Farmer (hamstring) from injured reserve this week. Jennings began practicing on Jan. 14, giving the Patriots until Feb. 4 to activate the first-year running back before his 21-day window expires (the week of the Super Bowl). Farmer just began practicing this past week on Wednesday, so his window will remain open through the Super Bowl. For now, New England will continue to roll with Johnson and Taylor as RB3/KR and DT5.

With a full 53-man roster and two practice-squad elevations, the Patriots game-day roster is at 55 players. New England will need to declare seven inactives 90 minutes before kickoff. The question is whether they'll need an additional edge rusher without captain Harold Landry III (knee, out) and if there's a game-day spot for a sixth wide receiver now that Hollins is expected to return. Perhaps that last game-day active spot would go to rookie OLB Bradyn Swinson instead of rookie WR Efton Chism III. Another option would be to lean on hybrid LB Jahlani Tavai as depth on the edge, rather than making Chism inactive, who could be helpful if Hollins has any limitations in his return.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/bzpgd8qnwdpfmclsinoi,N,,2026-01-25 12:01:49.739587

Seahawks-Rams Details: TV, radio and more for NFC Championship

That high-stakes rubber match will take place in Sunday afternoon’s NFC Championship, with the top-seeded Seahawks (15-3) hosting the fifth-seeded Rams (14-5) at Lumen Field for a spot in the Super Bowl.

The Rams won these teams’ first encounter in Week 11, intercepting Sam Darnold four times in a 21-19 win at SoFi Stadium. The Seahawks returned the favor in improbable fashion in Week 16, rallying from a 16-point fourth-quarter deficit for a stunning 38-37 overtime victory at Lumen Field.

The combined score of those two matchups? Rams 58, Seahawks 57.

And the combined total yardage? Rams 830, Seahawks 829.

Yes, the difference between these two juggernauts has been that razor-tight.

As kickoff approaches, let’s take a closer look at Seahawks-Rams, Part III.

The injury situation

Both teams are pretty healthy for this late in the season.

Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold (oblique) and left tackle Charles Cross (foot) were both on the injury report this week, but both are considered good to go for Sunday. Cross didn’t play in the Week 16 matchup, so that could be a boost for Seattle.

However, the Seahawks will be without second-leading rusher Zach Charbonnet, who suffered a season-ending torn ACL in last weekend’s divisional round. George Holani, Velus Jones Jr. and Cam Akers are all options to fill the void behind leading rusher Kenneth Walker III.

Seahawks injury report | Rams injury report

Rams edge rusher Byron Young (knee), who had a team-high 12 sacks in the regular season, is questionable but expected to play.

Meanwhile, several Rams who missed the Week 16 matchup will be on the field this time around: six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Davante Adams, right guard Kevin Dotson, tight end Tyler Higbee and safety Quentin Lake.

Adams hauled in a league-high 14 touchdown catches this season, including a 1-yard TD against Seattle in the Week 11 matchup. However, the Seahawks otherwise did a good job of keeping him in check, as that was Adams’ lone reception of the game.

The big storyline: Turnovers

One of the few major differences between these teams in the first two matchups? The Rams’ 7-1 advantage in the turnover margin.

Turnovers were the story in Week 11, as the Rams’ defense flustered Darnold into a nightmare four-interception performance. Seattle actually outgained the Rams 414-249 that afternoon, but a 4-1 turnover deficit was simply too much to overcome.

Turnovers were also nearly the story in Week 16, as the Seahawks lost the turnover battle 3-0 after two more Darnold interceptions and a Cooper Kupp fumble. If not for the largest fourth-quarter comeback in franchise history, Seattle would have been ruing those costly mistakes.

Needless to say, the Seahawks can’t afford to go minus-3 in the turnover margin again.

As such, all eyes will be on Darnold to see if he can avoid the big mistakes. Seattle’s QB1 committed a league-high 20 turnovers (14 interceptions, six fumbles) in the regular season. And in his past three matchups against the Rams – including a wild-card playoff loss with the Minnesota Vikings last season – he’s combined for just two touchdown passes and eight turnovers.

On the flip side, though the traditional stats don’t show it, Rams star quarterback and MVP front-runner Matthew Stafford has flirted with danger this season. Though Stafford committed just 12 turnovers in 19 total regular-season and postseason games, he’s been attributed by Pro Football Focus with 25 turnover-worthy plays. Darnold, by contrast, has 19 turnover-worthy plays.

In essence, Darnold has paid the price for putting the ball in compromising situations, while Stafford has had favorable luck due to opponents dropping would-be interceptions and fumbles ending up in his teammates’ hands.

Stafford has really been living on the edge lately, logging 15 turnover-worthy plays over his past six games. That includes six turnover-worthy plays over the Rams’ two playoff games, despite only one of those plays actually resulting in a turnover.

If Darnold takes better care of the ball and Stafford’s turnover luck runs out against Seattle’s vaunted defense, the Seahawks could flip the script on Sunday.

Seahawks defense vs. Rams offense

The Seahawks have the NFL’s top-ranked scoring defense, led by one of the league’s brightest defensive minds in head coach Mike Macdonald.

The Rams have the NFL’s top-ranked scoring offense, led by Stafford and one of the league’s brightest offensive minds in head coach Sean McVay.

It’s a true heavyweight clash between two of the NFL’s top units and two of the league’s most cutting-edge play-callers.

In Week 11, Macdonald’s defense had its way. Despite losing 21-19, the Seahawks limited the Rams to just 249 total yards, their second-lowest output of the season. They held Stafford to a season-low 130 passing yards and just 4.6 yard per pass attempt, the latter of which was the lowest mark of his entire 83-game tenure with the Rams.

But in the Week 16 rematch, the roles were reversed. The Seahawks rallied for a wild 38-37 overtime win, but their defense struggled mightily while allowing a franchise-record 581 total yards. Stafford threw for a whopping 457 yards – including 225 to star wideout Puka Nacua – and gashed Seattle’s vaunted defense with four completions of 40-plus yards. To put that in perspective, the Seahawks allowed just three 40-plus-yard completions over their other 17 games combined.

So, what was the difference between those two dramatically different outcomes?

One key factor was the amount of pressure Seattle’s pass rush generated. Though the Seahawks didn’t sack Stafford in either game, they were able to force him into more of a dink-and-dunk approach in the first matchup.

During that Week 11 clash, Stafford’s average time to throw was 2.46 seconds, which was his third-fastest mark of the season, according to PFF. As a result, he barely attacked downfield, finishing just 2 of 5 for 31 yards on throws that were targeted 10-plus yards past the line of scrimmage.

On the flip side, Stafford’s 2.82-second average time to throw in the Week 16 matchup was his fourth-longest mark of the season. With more time to attack the intermediate to deep areas of Seattle’s defense, he went 10 of 20 for 322 yards on passes 10-plus yards downfield.

If the Seahawks’ pass rush can speed up Stafford like it did in Week 11, that’d go a long way to helping slow down the Rams’ high-powered attack.

Seahawks offense vs. Rams defense

The Rams’ defense has been trending in the wrong direction.

Over the first 12 weeks of the season, Los Angeles allowed just 16.3 points per game and ranked No. 1 in defensive EPA, according to RBSDM.com. But from Week 13 through the divisional round of the playoffs, the Rams surrendered 26.9 points per game and ranked 18th in defensive EPA.

Shaky cornerback play has been a major culprit. Since Week 13, Rams cornerbacks Emmanuel Forbes Jr. and Cobie Durant have combined to allow 667 passing yards and nine touchdowns, according to PFF. L.A.’s run defense has been leakier as well, plummeting from seventh in yards allowed per attempt (3.9) over the first 10 weeks to 24th (4.6) since Week 11.

Meanwhile, Seattle’s offense found a run-pass balance down the stretch.

Over the first half of the season, Darnold and NFL receiving leader Jaxon Smith-Njigba torched opposing defenses with an explosive passing attack. But the Seahawks’ ground game lagged behind, ranking 31st in yards per carry (3.7) and 27th in rushing EPA over the first nine weeks.

Midway through the season, defenses began placing a greater emphasis on taking away big plays over the top. As a result, the Seahawks’ passing attack became much less explosive. But in the meantime, their run game rounded into form. Since Week 10, Seattle ranks ninth in yards per carry (4.6) and fourth in rushing EPA.

Of course, the Seahawks’ ground attack will look different this week without Charbonnet, who suffered a season-ending torn ACL in last week’s divisional round.

But Walker had already been getting the bulk of the carries and is playing the best football of his career, averaging 5.0 yards per carry since Week 10. That includes a combined 167 rushing yards, 6.2 yards per carry and two touchdowns in Seattle’s two matchups against the Rams, highlighted by a 55-yard TD run in Week 16.

It’s imperative that Walker and the Seahawks continue to be efficient on the ground Sunday. Staying on schedule will be vital to keeping Darnold out of obvious pass-rush situations, which is where Pro Bowl edge rushers Jared Verse and Young can really wreak havoc and force Seattle’s quarterback into bad decisions.

Also, if the Seahawks have enough success on the ground, that could force Los Angeles to put another defender in the box – which in turn could help open up explosive passing opportunities against the Rams’ vulnerable cornerbacks.

The Macdonald-McVay chess match on the other side of the ball will get the bulk of the attention, and rightfully so. But it’ll also be a fascinating tactical battle between Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak and Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula, who both have drawn head-coaching interest from other teams.

The X-factor: Special teams

The biggest discrepancy between these teams comes in the game’s third phase.

The Seahawks have been exceptional on special teams all season long, ranking No. 2 in special teams DVOA, according to FTN Fantasy. The Rams, meanwhile, rank 26th.

Seattle’s special teams unit has delivered a slew of impact plays – two Rashid Shaheed kick return touchdowns, a Shaheed punt return TD, a Tory Horton punt return TD, two blocked field goals, a blocked punt and even a rare end-zone kickoff recovery for a touchdown.

And of course, special teams swung the Week 16 matchup, with Shaheed’s 58-yard punt return TD serving as the catalyst to the Seahawks’ dramatic fourth-quarter comeback.

In a matchup with such slim margins, another big-time play from Seattle’s special teams unit could be the difference.

Home cookin’

The Seahawks are 3-0 all-time at home in conference championship games.

They steamrolled the Carolina Panthers 34-14 in the 2005 NFC title game, they edged the San Francisco 49ers 23-17 in the 2013 NFC title game and they staged a stunning comeback for a 28-22 overtime win over the Green Bay Packers in the 2014 NFC title game.

Furthermore, the Seahawks have won 11 consecutive home playoff games with fans in the stands. Seattle’s only home playoff loss over the past two decades came in a wild-card defeat to the Rams during the 2020 COVID season.
