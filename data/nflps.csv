Neither participated in their first full practice of the week Wednesday. They also were ruled out on the Bears’ estimated injury report after Tuesday’s walkthrough.

The Bears have one final injury report Thursday.

Burden hurt his ankle after catching a screen pass Sunday and is considered day-to-day. Odunze is trying to return from a chronic foot injury that he has tried to manage for most of the season. He sat out the Bears’ first game against the Packers and was slated to return Sunday, only to feel pain during warmups.

Receivers coach Antwaan Randle El said he has tried to encourage Odunze, who had never missed an NFL game until two weeks ago.

“To miss one game is tough enough, but it’s a tough deal,” he said. “You have to keep encouraging him — ‘Hey, we can’t wait to get [you] back. This too shall pass. It’s just a bump in the road.’ ”

Linebacker Amen Ogbongbemiga remains out with a hamstring injury. The Bears also added running back D’Andre Swift to the injury report with a groin injury. He was limited, as was tight end Cole Kmet, who hurt his back and ankle Sunday.

In fact, Hafley made a very bold proclamation Wednesday, predicting that the 2026 season will be a historic one for Parsons, who prior to his injury became the first player in NFL history to record at least 12.5 sacks in each of his first five seasons.

""If I were a betting man, I would bet that he comes back even better and probably breaks the sack record next year,"" Hafley told reporters Wednesday. ""So I'm going to put that on Micah and myself. You guys can put it out there, and that's the confidence I have in him.""

The single-season sack record of 22.5 is currently held by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt -- but potentially not for long. Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett is just one sack away from tying the record this season and has three games left to break it. Garrett said his goal is to finish the season with 25 sacks, so Parsons is going to have his hands full to prove his defensive coordinator right.

Micah Parsons to have ACL surgery: How Green Bay will try to replace star pass rusher

JP Acosta

Record aside, it's clear that Parsons has made a quick impression on Hafley after he was traded from the Dallas Cowboys just prior to the start of the season. Parsons has made an impact on the field as well with Green Bay's defense currently ranking eighth in the NFL in points allowed.

In 14 games, Parsons put up 12.5 sacks, two forced fumbles, 12 tackles for loss and 26 quarterback hits. During a recent three-game span, Parsons tallied six sacks as Green Bay won each game after an underwhelming 5-3-1 start.

""He's a guy that came in here, literally, like three days before we played a game,"" Hafley said. ""Quickly developed a really good relationship with him. ... I just have so much respect for the guy.""

While Hafley has high hopes for Parsons in 2026, he is also confident that his defense can continue to have success this season, starting with Sunday's pivotal road game against the Chicago Bears -- a matchup with major playoff implications.

""We've got really good players. We've played good defense and we're going to continue to play good defense,"" Hafley said. ""Our guys understand that and I think it's important for everyone to understand that these guys have a lot of pride and they're going to get even closer because of this. And they're going to play well.

""Our best players are going to step up. And the guys who haven't played a lot, that's been our job all year is to develop those guys so in situations like this, they're going to step up.

McDaniel confirmed the news later Wednesday, adding that Zach Wilson will back up Ewers, while Tagovailoa will serve as the emergency third-string quarterback.

""I think Quinn gives this team the best chance to win,"" McDaniel told reporters, explaining his decision. ""Ultimately, the team needs and I'm looking for conviction in quarterback play.

""I'm here, and my role right now, if I'm not starting, is to help the starter help us win games,"" Tagovailoa told reporters.

The benching doesn't come as a surprise after McDaniel said Tuesday he was contemplating the move. When coaches begin waffling on a starter, a change almost always follows.

On Tuesday, McDaniel said the quarterback play “was not good enough.” Now he'll see if he can get better from Ewers.

How Tua's struggles led to benching

Tagovailoa's struggles aren't a one- or two-week issue. The starter has been on the downswing for more than a month.

In Monday night's blowout loss, he put up 65 passing yards with an interception and two drive-killing sacks through three quarters. The bulk of his 253 passing yards and both of his touchdowns came in garbage time.

During the Dolphins' four-game winning streak that preceded their Week 15 loss, McDaniel had mitigated the passing game, leaning on an explosive rushing attack. Tua went four consecutive games with fewer than 175 passing yards. It was enough to beat mostly sub-500 teams, but not an indicator of a healthy passing attack.

Tagovailoa leads the NFL with 15 interceptions in 2025. His -0.06 EPA per dropback ranks fourth-worst among quarterbacks with at least 300 pass attempts, ahead of only Cam Ward, Geno Smith and Joe Flacco, per Next Gen Stats. His total QBR is also fourth-worst among qualifying QBs -- Ward, Smith and J.J. McCarthy.

We've seen little of the quick-decision, precision passing game that Tua deployed during his Pro Bowl season in 2023, when he led the NFL with 4,624 yards passing. Far too often, the sixth-year pro has looked lost, missing reads, spiking throws, struggling with pressure and making rookie-type mistakes.

McDaniel's conscious diminishment of the passing offense over the past month spoke volumes about what he thought of the quarterback's play. The benching cemented those assumptions.

Examining QB's future in Miami

If McDaniel remains the head coach in 2026, can he really turn back to a benched quarterback? Can Miami afford to move on?

The Dolphins inked Tagovailoa to a four-year, $212.4 million contract in 2024. Less than two years in, he's been sent to the bench for ineffective play. With three years remaining on his contract, Tua is due $56.4 million guaranteed in 2026.

Cutting or trading him would not come cheap. Releasing him outright would carry a $99.2 million dead-money hit. Even a post-June 1 release would still count $67.4 million against the cap in 2026. A spring trade would be a little less, with $45.2 million in dead money hitting the books. But who is trading for an ineffective, benched QB with a $39 million base salary?

We've seen teams take their lumps with dead money. Russell Wilson in Denver is the biggest example, with the Broncos taking on a record $85 million in dead money, including $53 million in 2024.

The other factor in benching Tagovailoa is his injury history. The quarterback missed multiple games in four of his first five seasons, including multiple concussions and a hip injury that ended his 2024 season. Putting him in bubble wrap to close the season will avoid an injury that could hinder the Dolphins' options this offseason.

Miami is already in a salary-cap quandary, projected to be roughly $11 million over the cap next season, per Over The Cap. Tackling that and dead money from Tua's contract would take gold-medal level cap gymnastics.

The Dolphins could take a page from the Falcons playbook with Kirk Cousins, hanging on to the highly-paid quarterback as an uber-expensive backup -- while possibly hoping a post-June 1 trade materialized to offer some relief. Even considering that move would require a cheap starter on a rookie contract to take the reins.

There are no great options if Tua isn't on the field earning his money.

What can Ewers provide down stretch?

The offseason steps in Miami could come down to how Ewers plays down the stretch.

The seventh-round rookie gets the nod over former Jets first-rounder Zach Wilson, who had been the backup in recent weeks. The decision to leapfrog Wilson for Ewers feels like a move to see what the rookie has to offer. If he hits -- say, like Brock Purdy -- it would give Miami a potential cheap starter at the most expensive position in football.

Ewers has appeared in one game this season, taking over for a benched Tagovailoa in a Week 7 blowout loss to the Cleveland Browns. In mop-up duty, the rookie completed 5 of 8 passes for 53 yards. Now he'll get a chance to show what he's got with a full week of prep.

A three-year starter at Texas, Ewers passed for 9,128 yards and 68 touchdowns with 24 interceptions in 36 games in Austin. The 22-year-old doesn't have the strongest whip, but he can get the ball out quickly, and works in rhythm. Those should benefit him in McDaniel's offense. The rookie will have to display a solid understanding of his progression and avoid the negative plays that hindered him in his final season at Texas.

With the Dolphins officially eliminated from the postseason, they'll give the seventh-rounder a shot down the stretch. It's a worthwhile move. If Ewers impresses, it would provide a massive low-cost answer at quarterback entering 2026. If he bombs, nothing is lost, and Miami could start to look at first-round rookies in April's draft.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/dgumajosqotkauxru6au,N,,2025-12-18 01:59:05.449320

The Broncos also have rookie cornerback Jahdae Barron, who has played rotational snaps at safety. So the team will likely turn to in-house options to replace Jones in the starting lineup, but they could still use more depth at safety.

He played in 12 games with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before that crash last fall and has since recovered. Whitehead worked out for the Atlanta Falcons earlier this year.

2. John Johnson (29): The NFL suspended Johnson for the first three games of the 2025 season for an undisclosed reason. The suspension has long since ended, but he remains a free agent with 15 interceptions on his resume.

3. Vonn Bell (31): A former New Orleans Saints second-round draft pick under Sean Payton, Bell played in all 17 games with the Cincinnati Bengals last season but has remained unsigned in 2025. He has eight career interceptions.

4. Adrian Amos (32): He had a stint on the San Francisco 49ers' practice squad last season but hasn't appeared in a regular-season game since 2023. He was a 17-game starter with the Green Bay Packers in 2022, but only has three starts on his resume since then.

5. Justin Simmons (32): The four-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro needs no introduction to Broncos fans, but it's unclear if he would be willing to return to Denver after being cut by Sean Payton in 2024.

Burkholder spoke to reporters Wednesday, two days after Mahomes had surgery in Dallas to repair a torn ACL and LCL in his left knee. Burkholder said the operation by Dr. Dan Cooper — the Dallas Cowboys’ head physician — was successful.

“Ballpark on this thing (for recovery) is nine months. Could be a month or two less, a month or two more,” Burkholder said. “You never know what goes on, and everybody’s designed differently biomechanically. And so you just have to go through it.”

Burkholder confirmed Wednesday that Mahomes suffered a “significant left knee injury” that was non-contact and also caused by a hyperextension. Mahomes underwent an MRI after the game in K.C., then consulted with his agent and family before getting a second opinion from Cooper in Dallas.

Mahomes met with Cooper on Monday morning, then had surgery that night. Burkholder said the reason for the quick movement was Mahomes’ LCL injury. Cooper wanted to repair that ligament, which had detached.

“They said everything he had in this injury was fixable, correctable,” Burkholder said, “and it was fixed on Monday night by Dr. Cooper.”

Mahomes began rehab in Dallas on Tuesday morning, Burkholder said. The Chiefs QB was set to remain there through Thursday before returning to Kansas City on Friday.

Burkholder said Mahomes would do the majority of his rehab with Chiefs assistant athletic trainer Julie Frymyer, who also helped him through previous knee, toe and ankle injuries.

The early goal with Mahomes in rehab, Burkholder said, will be to get his muscles firing to help reduce the swelling in his knee. Mahomes, who was placed on injured reserve Wednesday, will wear a protective brace as his knee heals.

Though Burkholder cautioned that each injury is different, he was optimistic about a quick recovery given Mahomes’ track record.

“As a player, his mindset is a little different than most. He’s so regimented at what he does,” Burkholder said. “He’s in here at 6 a.m.; he’s the last guy out at night. He’ll take the rehab like that.”

Chiefs coach Andy Reid said he’d been impressed by Mahomes’ mindset.

“He’s so positive right now,” Reid said. “Like Rick said, he attacked this thing the day of. You wouldn’t expect anything less.”

Backup quarterback Gardner Minshew said Mahomes has been active in the Chiefs’ quarterbacks’ group text this week.

The biggest reason? To get his guys fired up for Sunday’s road game against the Tennessee Titans.

“That dude still wants us to win. That’s what he cares about,” Minshew said. “It’s awesome to have a leader like that.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/17141600/GettyImages-2249657600-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-18 00:01:11.071493

Chiefs coach Andy Reid announced at a Dec. 17 media availability that Rice had entered the NFL's concussion protocol on Monday.

Reid did not provide any clarity about when Rice – who played 85.2% of the Chiefs' offensive snaps against the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 15 – may have suffered the injury.

""Those things happen,"" Reid said of Rice's injury. ""We'll just see where it ends up going.""

Rice logged a team-high 11 targets and recorded seven catches for 51 yards in Kansas City's 16-13 loss on Sunday. The Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention by virtue of the defeat.

Here's what to know about Rice's status moving forward.

Will Rashee Rice play Week 16?

The Chiefs did not provide clarity about whether Rice will be able to play in the team's Week 16 game against the Tennessee Titans. Reid simply announced the third-year receiver had been placed into the NFL's concussion protocol.

The Chiefs did not clarify whether they would shut Rice down for the remainder of the season as he deals with a head injury and with the team having already been eliminated from playoff contention.

But if Rice does return to action, he will have to first clear the NFL's concussion protocol – which is designed to ensure a player's safety after suffering a head injury – before he can return to practice.

The five-step process to be cleared is as follows, as outlined by the NFL:

Symptom limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Full football activity/clearance

The NFL also notes ""there is no set time-frame"" for a player to return to participation following a concussion. Team medical staff consider a variety of factors in determining when a player can return, including their current concussive injury, past exposures, medical and family history and future risk in managing a player's care.

Chiefs WR depth chart

The Chiefs have seven receivers on their 53-man roster, giving them plenty of depth to trust if Rice is forced to miss time. Below is a look at the pecking order within the unit:

Rashee Rice

Xavier Worthy

Hollywood Brown

JuJu Smith-Schuster

Tyquan Thornton

Jalen Royals

Nikko Remigio

In addition to Rice's injury, Thornton is in the NFL's concussion protocol while Brown missed Week 15 with a personal issue. If all three can't play, Worthy would operate as the team's No. 1 receiver while Smith-Schuster and fourth-round rookie Royals would have a shot to earn increased roles in Kansas City's receiver rotation.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/17/USAT/87814401007-rashee-rice-chiefs-121725.jpg?crop=2851,1603,x1173,y367&width=2851&height=1603&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-18 01:09:07.588110

As many as nine teams can clinch playoff spots in Week 16. The Denver Broncos can actually clinch the AFC's No. 1 overall seed this week with a victory, a Los Angeles Chargers loss or tie, a New England Patriots loss and a Buffalo Bills loss or tie. It's been 21 years since a team won the NFC East in consecutive seasons, but the Philadelphia Eagles can end that streak with a victory over the Washington Commanders on Saturday or a Dallas Cowboys loss against the Chargers on Sunday.

The focus is certainly football, but it's impossible to fully analyze how teams are playing at this point in the year without factoring in injuries. Every team is banged up to a certain degree, which could play a not insignificant role in how the rest of the season unfolds.

With most teams returning to the practice field for the first time this week on Wednesday, we'll take a survey around the league as teams publish their initial injury reports. We'll also analyze the final injury report for Thursday night's critical NFC West showdown between the 11-3 Los Angeles Rams and the 11-3 Seattle Seahawks.

Los Angeles Rams at Seattle Seahawks (-1.5)

Thursday, 8:15 p.m. ET | Stream on Prime Video

Los Angeles Rams: WR Davante Adams (knee/hamstring) DOUBTFUL, DE Braden Fiske (ankle) QUESTIONABLE

Seattle Seahawks: LT Charles Cross (hamstring) OUT

Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Davante Adams departed the team's 41-34 Week 15 win over the Detroit Lions with a non-contact hamstring injury, and that injury has him listed as doubtful to suit up in what's seemingly an NFC West division title championship game of sorts. Adams leads the league with 14 receiving touchdowns this season, and if he doesn't play, that will be a tremendous loss for quarterback Matthew Stafford and head coach Sean McVay. Edge rusher Braden Fiske (ankle) is questionable after also not practicing all week like Adams.

The Seattle Seahawks will be without starting left tackles Charles Cross (hamstring) on Thursday night, a huge blow for quarterback Sam Darnold, who threw four interceptions in a 21-19 Week 11 road loss at the Rams. Josh Jones, a 2020 third-round pick by the Seahawks, will be making his first start since Week 3 of the 2023 season, a 37-17 road win at the Jacksonville Jaguars, in place of Cross.

Philadelphia Eagles at Washington Commanders (+6.5) (Saturday)

Rick Burkholder, the Chiefs' vice president of sports medicine and performance, said Wednesday the procedure performed in Dallas by Dr. Dan Cooper on Monday night went well. The operation happened about 24 hours after Mahomes tore his ACL and LCL in a loss to the Chargers.

The recovery time for such an injury is about ninth months, though it could vary by several months depending on various factors. Next season is expected to kick off on Sept. 10, 2026, and the Chiefs could play their first game a few days later.

""Every player is different. Every sport is different. Every position is different,"" Burkholder said. ""[Mahomes] is so in tune to what he does, he does it a little quicker. Ballpark on this is nine months, but it could be a month or two more, a month or two less.""

The loss to the Chargers eliminated the Chiefs from the postseason, ending that streak at a decade. They had also won the past nine AFC West titles, reached the previous seven conference championship games and played in the past three Super Bowls.

Now, backup Gardner Minshew will quarterback them through the final three games beginning Sunday at Tennessee.

""Quick turnaround from a very emotional game, and obviously the situation with Pat, the situation with our team's playoff picture,"" he said. ""But you know what? You are where you're at. We have to turn this around and get a win this weekend.""

The Chiefs could be missing several big names beyond their star quarterback.

Rashee Rice and fellow wide receiver Tyquan Thornton are in the concussion protocol after taking vicious hits in the game against Los Angeles, while left tackle Jaylon Moore remains out with a knee injury and right tackle Jawaan Taylor is out with an elbow issue.

On defense, cornerback Trent McDuffie is still dealing with a knee injury and linebacker Leo Chenal with a shoulder problem.

None of those players practiced Wednesday.

""We'll see how they roll timewise for the game,"" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said.

As for Mahomes, he plans to return to Kansas City by Friday, where he will continue rehabbing with Burkholder's staff. Leading the effort will be Julie Frymyer, his assistant trainer and top physical therapist, whose name made headlines during the 2022-23 playoffs for her role in helping Mahomes overcome a severe high ankle sprain without having to miss a game.

Frymyer was even featured alongside Mahomes recently in a State Farm insurance commercial.

""I think you guys know, as a player, his mindset is a little different than most,"" Burkholder said. ""He's so regimented in what he does. He's in here at 6 a.m. He's the last guy out at night. He'll take the rehab like that. When you add up all the little things, that allows the player to get back faster. They don't heal up faster, they just get back to performance faster.""

Reid said he's spoken daily with Mahomes since the injury in the closing minutes of Sunday's game.

""He's so positive right now,"" Reid said. ""Like Rick said, he attacked this thing the day of. You wouldn't expect anything less. 'Get me up, get me going,' he's basically saying, an hour after the game. 'Brace me up and let me go.' It's not one of those injuries, obviously, but that's his mindset. I think he'll do great with the rehab. He's a pretty fast healer that way. And his attitude is 90% of things, how you go about it. How you're willing to push through the pain to get right.""

Minshew acknowledged a strange feeling walking through the team facility without Mahomes this week. But the two QBs have been in touch, and the veteran of 46 starts across seven NFL seasons is looking forward to Mahomes' input the rest of the way.

Giants fans who are angry that Dart was removed from Sunday’s fourth quarter on the goal line feel that Dart had not taken a severe enough hit to warrant an evaluation.

They are both wrong.

The NFL’s arbitrary enforcement and lack of consistent accountability with their concussion policies warrants scrutiny.

But it’s important not to let the public discourse about concussions descend into the unhelpful gray area, where people like Giants offensive coordinator Tim Kelly can say that Dart returning from a concussion in November was “no different than if someone was coming off a sprained ankle.”

Big hits absolutely can cause concussions, like when Dart slammed his head on the grass in Chicago and was diagnosed with a confirmed concussion — or like when Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss flipped Dart like an Olympic gymnast in New England in his first game back.

The science shows, however, that less severe, sub-concussive or non-concussive blows to the head can cause significant long-term damage, too.

In other words, a person could go their whole lives never being officially diagnosed with a concussion, but if they endure hundreds or thousands of repeated bumps, blows or collisions to the head, the best science has linked that to potential changes in brain function and to cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

CTE is caused in part by repeated traumatic brain injuries, which include concussions and non-concussive impacts.

The NFL settled a $1 billion dollar lawsuit with former players in 2016 over the lack of education and mismanagement of concussions that is now connected to some of those retired players’ health ailments.

This is a hot button issue and an important one, not something to be dismissed or snickered at — especially, for Dart, considering how the Giants’ opponents are now zeroing in on attacking the mobile rookie QB.

On Tuesday night’s episode of HBO’s ‘Hard Knocks,’ Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn and defensive coordinator Joe Whitt Jr. were shown in the meeting room telling their players to be ready to hit the vulnerable Dart in the open field at MetLife Stadium.

“The last piece: the QB, alright,” Quinn said, showing film from the Patriots game. “When he’s out here [out of the pocket], he is a running back first. This is a good hit by Ellis on the sideline. [Dart] is not looking to go down and get into the slide. So we’ve got to go out and hit him, fellas.”

Whitt reiterated that Dart’s style of running would give the defense opportunities to be physical and to get the ball.

“The quarterback is a very competitive dual-threat guy,” Whitt said. “He will try to run the ball like a running back. He will try to run you over. He will try to stiff-arm. He doesn’t really run out of bounds. He doesn’t slide a whole bunch, OK? We can get the ball off of him. The ball is life, the ball is air and we need it.”

Fast forward to Sunday’s Giants loss, and interim head coach Mike Kafka called two designed runs for Dart, plus a third play that had a QB run as an option, in which Dart ultimately got hurt.

Dart took significant hits on all three plays, fumbled once and was injured on the third.

Even though Dart’s run wasn’t obviously a huge hit to the head in the moment, he did have his head and neck hit and twisted back when he lowered his body into defensive tackles Eddie Goldman and Javon Kinlaw.

Dart, on replay, appeared to have some sort of reaction to the hit while staying briefly on the turf, too. He said Wednesday that the Washington coaches’ comments about him don’t phase him.

“[Georgia coach] Kirby Smart said the exact same thing every time that he played against me, so did [former Alabama coach] Nick Saban and every coach I played in college,” Dart said. “This is nothing new. I just got to go out there, try to play smart and be available for my team.”

There is a major and understandable problem, of course, with the NFL and Giants not removing Dart from that November game in Chicago — after he was motionless on the field — and then taking him out for something as comparatively harmless as Sunday’s sequence.

So Dart can be forgiven for getting frustrated by the inconsistency and even by the possibility that he is receiving closer scrutiny only because the NFL and NFL players’ association are overcorrecting.

The very public optics of former head coach Brian Daboll charging into the blue medical tent and getting fined earlier in the season, followed by the mishandling of Dart’s concussion in Chicago, has made for bad optics broadcasted to the entire country.

And leaks from inside the Giants’ building simultaneously encouraged this as a discussion point and turned it into a five-alarm fire.

But amid all of the hypocrisy and inconsistency, Dart and Giants fans and everyone else must remember that it’s a good thing when player safety is prioritized, not a bad thing.

Five concussion evaluations for Dart since the start of the preseason is an alarming number, even with only one diagnosed concussion since he entered the pros.

Every hit to the head matters. And Dart’s long-term health as a human — not his availability as a football player — is what everyone should care about most.

LAWRENCE RESTS, THIBODEAUX REMAINS OUT

Defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence was limited during Wednesday’s practice as part of a non-injury related rest day. And edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux (shoulder sprain) continued to sit out practice, meaning he might miss a fifth straight game.

Wide receiver Beaux Collins (concussion/neck), linebacker Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles (illness) and defensive lineman Rakeem Nuñez-Roches Sr. (ankle) also sat out.

Collins’ injury when he returned to practice last week from injured reserve was called a “neck” injury. Now the Giants have added “concussion/neck” to his status.

Punter Jamie Gillan (left knee), corner Art Green (illness/ hamstring) and corners Dru Phillips (heel) and Rico Payton (back) also were limited.

Travis Kelce on his future with Chiefs There are just three games left for the 2025 Chiefs.","The Kansas City Chiefs have been soaring to ""New Heights"" for nearly a decade. In 2025, they are sinking to new lows.

After seven straight AFC championship game appearances and three Super Bowl victories, the Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention in Week 15. While that was bound to happen at some point, their loss to the Los Angeles Chargers will linger a bit longer as Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL in the process – an injury that could keep him out into the 2026 season.

It has been a tough year for everyone involved in the Chiefs' operation, but Travis Kelce can be seen as a headliner. While he didn't directly address his long-term future with the Chiefs or in the NFL, he touched on a number of topics on the latest episode of ""New Heights,"" which released on Dec. 17:

Travis Kelce on Chiefs' playoff elimination

""When you need them the most, things weren't falling for us,"" Kelce said about the team being eliminated. ""Gotta go back to the drawing board. We got three games left. The integrity of who you are as a professional, as a player, you gotta love this (expletive). Chiefs Kingdom, we're gonna give you everything we've got. There's no question about that.""

The tight end's 13th season has been far from lucky. He will now miss the playoffs for just the second time in his career.

Travis Kelce discusses Patrick Mahomes injury on 'New Heights'

Kelce noted that plenty of players on the Chiefs were dealing with injuries heading into the game and throughout the contest. He acknowledged that they fought to the end, but seeing Mahomes go down didn't feel real.

""On a freakish play to see one-five go down like that man, it (expletive), it was almost like it wasn't real,"" Kelce added. (Expletive) just sucks man.""

He said there was a belief that they would find a way to win like they always do, but that wasn't in the cards for Kansas City in Week 15. The Chiefs had been dominant in one-score games a year ago. That script has been flipped in 2025, posting a 1-7 record in those situations.

Regardless, they still had the ball, down 16-13, with the chance to tie or take the lead before Mahomes suffered his injury with less than a minute to go.

""Sure felt like that,"" Kelce said, thinking they would find a way to win. ""That's why when one-five went down, I was like, 'No way this is what happens, right?""

Travis Kelce addresses Mahomes' return, Chiefs' 2026 prospects

Whether Mahomes returns in time for the 2026 season remains to be seen, but the tight end isn't counting him out.

""He's a warrior,"" Kelce said. ""I'm telling you. This guy played through everything, battled through everything, crowned champion because he's battled through everything. He's gonna battle through this. It's the only way this guy is wired. He's gonna make sure he's gonna come back stronger than ever.""

""Hopefully the Chiefs can get him back as soon as possible,"" Kelce added. ""I know he's gonna be doing everything he can to get back out on that field for the Chiefs.""

For now, Kansas City will turn to Gardner Minshew for the remainder of the season.

Travis Kelce on his future with Chiefs

There are just three games left for the 2025 Chiefs. None of them will have playoff implications, but that won't stop Kelce from putting his best foot forward in what became a slightly emotional rant.

""There's an integrity thing here that when you sign up for the gig,"" Kelce said. ""You're living out a kid's dream that never got a chance to do this. You're playing this game obviously to win Super Bowls, you're playing this game to be in those playoff scenarios, but at the end of the day, you're playing in the NFL. And that's a (expletive) blessing.

""That's an honor. It's an honor to be out there. It's an honor to feel the soreness because you're actually out there, (expletive) doing it. No matter if you're getting the (expletive) ball thrown to you, no matter if you're blocking your tail off. It's an honor to be out there in a uniform, playing for the guys around you, playing for your family, playing for the people back home that are watching you.""

With just three games to go, it remains a mystery if there will be more than that for the star tight end, who didn't discuss his future in the wake of the Chiefs' elimination and Mahomes' injury.

It feels like the end of an era. It remains to be seen if it truly is.

He and guard Isaac Seumalo, who left the Dolphins game with what was announced as a tricep injury, are expected to be limited some this week and Seumalo also didn't practice on Wednesday.
I would imagine he certainly is going to be limited at the early portions of week and see where it leads us.
Harmon missed the last three games with a knee injury, but he is on the mend.
""We had some guys that missed the previous game or games and are angling toward getting back,"" said Tomlin.","The Steelers began their preparation for Sunday's game against the Detroit Lions at Ford Field, a game that is key for both teams with the playoff races heating up.

Per Coach Mike Tomlin, the team didn't have their normal practice, but instead opted for a 'high intensity walk-through' coming off a Monday night game.

""We will work hard and smart, and sometimes that means being inclusive,"" said Tomlin. ""So, we've probably got a high intensity walk-through on the menu (Wednesday) in an effort to have as many people participate as we can as opposed to running and practicing.

""Again, that's not outside of the ordinary this time of year. You do what you need to do in an effort to get the collective ready, and also get them to the stadium in as good of physical condition as you can get them as well.

""You certainly hope that there is a cumulative effect of the daily work we've had over the course of this journey that can be an asset that we can summon up when we get pressed on a short week like this week.""

As of his weekly Tuesday press conference, Tomlin didn't have any updates on the health and status of linebacker T.J. Watt, who missed Monday night's game against the Dolphins with a lung issue. Watt did not practice on Wednesday.

""No new news on T.J.,"" said Tomlin. ""I'm sure I will a little later in the week, but I hadn't heard any new updates regarding his availability or what that looks like as he starts to work his way back to us this week, and so no real news there.""

One of the players who stepped in to replace him on Monday night, linebacker Nick Herbig, is dealing with a hamstring injury and didn't practice on Wednesday. He and guard Isaac Seumalo, who left the Dolphins game with what was announced as a tricep injury, are expected to be limited some this week and Seumalo also didn't practice on Wednesday.

""Issac Seumalo got hurt (Monday) night,"" said Tomlin. ""I don't know what his status is as I stand here today. I would imagine he certainly is going to be limited at the early portions of week and see where it leads us.

""Same thing could be said for Herbig with his hamstring. See where it leads us.""

The arrow seems to be pointing up for rookie defensive lineman Derrick Harmon. Harmon missed the last three games with a knee injury, but he is on the mend. He was a full participant on Wednesday.

""We had some guys that missed the previous game or games and are angling toward getting back,"" said Tomlin. ""Probably the most favorable of those is Derrick Harmon.

""He was probably healthy enough to play at the very end of last week, but as a young guy with limited rep opportunities, I didn't think it would be fair to him or for us to put him in uniform.

""So he'll have an opportunity to get a complete week's work, go back to his hometown, and play some football. Excited about getting him back. He certainly has been an asset to us particularly in terms of defending and stopping the run, and anticipating what we're going to face this week, man, that will be big.

""Some other guys working their way back, (Andrus) Peat is still in the (concussion) protocol, so we'll let the protocol be our guide in terms of his availability. James Pierre was limited with a calf last week. See where that leads us.""

The Steelers have relied on their depth as injuries mounted this year, including players quarterback Aaron Rodgers called 'castoffs' from other teams who have been big contributors for the Steelers, especially when injuries have occurred.

""I'm never surprised by that to be honest with you,"" said Tomlin. ""That's why we have cliches like the standard is the standard, one man's misfortune is another man's opportunity.

""It's not if, it's when as it pertains to injury in our business. So, if you're in a position like mine, you better work your tail off to ready each and every man that's a part of the program and have that urgency daily. I certainly do, and we do as a staff.

""But those are the guys that are deserving of the credit. I'll never ask guys to be patient. I'll ask them to work while they wait, and a lot of guys have done that. We get performances like many of them just displayed. It's just evidence that they have, and certainly some of them are going to get additional opportunities to do so, and maybe some new guys will get opportunities to do so as we move forward. That's just the nature of this thing.

""I think your ability to adapt and adjust and pivot often defines a collective, and certainly we've had some opportunities to do so. We have had success at times and we better keep digging, because I've just been on enough of these journeys. I know it's a component of it.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/steelers/hussyskzp0kx4f7erlxb,N,,2025-12-17 18:02:24.031321

Written By Blaise Bourgeois | Published at December 17, 2025

With playoff implications abound, we're heading to NFL Week 16, where several high-profile matchups dominate the landscape.

Thursday Night Football gets us started with a potential NFC Championship preview as the Seattle Seahawks host NFC West rivals Los Angeles Rams in one of the most anticipated contests of the season.

Of course, the NFC North could be decided on Sunday as the 10-4 Chicago Bears host bitter rivals Green Bay, who sit at 9-4-1. With the Bears leading the Packers by a half-game with three games left in the regular season and both teams on the fence, this game could decide who gets to play in January and who heads to Cancun.

We also have an NFC South battle between co-leaders Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Carolina Panthers, who both sit at 7-7. They face off twice in the final three games of the season, and whoever fares best will move on to January.

There are a few other marquee matchups to look forward to this weekend, specifically the Steelers-Lions, Jaguars-Broncos, Ravens-Patriots, and Colts-49ers.

Here’s your full NFL Week 16 betting guide, including brief previews and predictions for each game. We'll also take a look at where injuries could make the biggest impacts. Be up to date on all of the latest NFL odds on all of our favorite betting sites.

Los Angeles Rams @ Seattle Seahawks

Odds: Rams -1.5 (ML: Rams -108, Seahawks -108 | Over/Under: 44.5 (via FanDuel)

The best game of the weekend happens to be on Thursday Night Football. Two division rivals who sit at 11-3 that could and should contend for the Super Bowl title square off for this epic thriller.

In their first meeting, in Los Angeles, the Rams squeaked past the Seahawks 21-19, with Sam Darnold throwing for four interceptions.

Darnold has only two games with 2+ interceptions this season and shouldn't revert to that kind of form again.

The matchup of the day should be Devon Witherspoon against Puka Nacua, especially if Davante Adams can't suit up. Adams has been battling both knee and hamstring injuries and has been less than 100% for several weeks now.

Ian Rapaport claims that Adams is unlikely to play, which should see this game lean towards the under. Playing in Seattle could push this even more towards Seattle.

📊 Prediction: Seahawks 21 Rams 20

Philadelphia Eagles @ Washington Commanders

Odds: Eagles -6.5 (ML: Eagles -285, Commanders +230 | Over/Under: 44.5 (via BetMGM)

No playoffs, and no more Jayden Daniels for the rest of the year as the Commanders begin to close the door on an unbelievably disappointing 2025 NFL season, one year removed from the NFC Championship game.

Washington has been absolutely crushed by injuries all season, with nine of their 22 starters missing at least seven games.

Commanders head coach Dan Quinn has shut down all players currently on injured reserve, including Daniels, Zach Ertz, and many more.

While Washington put on an impressive performance against the Giants last week, they did so by completing just 10 passes. They'd have to do a whole lot more to knock off Philadelphia. I don't see that happening.

📊 Prediction: Eagles 30 Commanders 10

Green Bay Packers @ Chicago Bears

Odds: Packers -1.5 (ML: Packers -115, Bears -105 | Over/Under: 46.5 (via DraftKings)

Talk about high stakes! One of the NFL's oldest and most storied rivalries unveils a new chapter in their biggest regular-season meeting in a crazy long time.

In fact, both teams haven't faced one another with both teams at least five games over .500 since December 2001.

Of course, to Chicago's luck, the entire NFC is extremely good, the NFC North race is still an extremely close three-team one, and they're nowhere near safe despite having 10 wins heading into Week 16.

However, Green Bay got absolutely obliterated in their loss to Denver last week. Micah Parsons is done for the year with a torn ACL, Christian Watson suffered a rib injury and is questionable, while a handful of others exited the game and didn't return.

There has never been a bigger chance for the Bears to claim themselves as the winners of this rivalry in a very long time. The door is wide open; they just have to get the job done. We think it's time.

📊 Prediction: Bears 31 Packers 27

NFL Sunday Early Afternoon

Buffalo Bills @ Cleveland Browns

Odds: Bills -10 (ML: Bills -600, Browns +425 | Over/Under: 42 (via BetMGM)

Talk about an ugly matchup. Even though the Bills are 10-point favorites, we don't see this being anywhere close to that number. They've struggled all year against great defenses, and this game should smash the under.

We also look forward to Myles Garrett breaking the NFL record for most sacks in a single season. He's at 21.5, only one short of the mark. We think he gets it done on Sunday.

📊 Prediction: Bills 16 Browns 9

Los Angeles Chargers @ Dallas Cowboys

Odds: Cowboys -2.5 (ML: Chargers +108, Cowboys -126 | Over/Under: 49.5 (via FanDuel)

These two teams can enjoy a shootout as much as any two teams in the league.

The 10-4 Chargers are rolling on with their season and are virtually assured of a playoff berth. The Cowboys needed to win last week to keep their realistic hopes alive. Unfortunately, now they're only in the race based on mathematics and not in reality.

Somehow, the Cowboys are favored in this one, which we don't quite understand at all. In fact, nobody actually does, which leads us to believe Vegas knows something we don't.

However, based on pure stats, the Chargers should be able to outduel Dallas in a lovely offensive battle. Plus, how much fight will a Cowboys team have now that they're essentially out of the playoffs?

📊 Prediction: Chargers 44 Cowboys 38

Kansas City Chiefs @ Tennessee Titans

Odds: Chiefs -3.5 (ML: Chiefs -190, Titans +156 | Over/Under: 37.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook)

Oof. We're into the really ugly part of the season. Not only are the Chiefs done for the year, but Patrick Mahomes has also torn his ACL, which casts a huge doubt on the future of the Chiefs' dynasty.

Surely, had the Chiefs stayed alive in the playoffs and Mahomes was healthy, the line would be set at -14.5 or higher. Instead, the Chiefs are only three-point favorites with Gardner Minshew under center.

We don't know who the Chiefs will trot out there, but we believe that head coach Andy Reid will be using the next three games to evaluate their bench talent. I would be smashing overs on backups and third-stringers.

📊 Prediction: Titans 16 Chiefs 13

Cincinnati Bengals @ Miami Dolphins

Odds: Bengals -2.5 (ML: Bengals -135, Dolphins +114 | Over/Under: 50.5 (via DraftKings)

Ah yes, another game where both teams are out of the playoffs, and the result means absolutely nothing except for NFL Draft order. Maybe a few players and coaches get some bonus money too.

The actual performances out on the field could mean a lot on both sides. Bengals star quarterback Joe Burrow is very disgruntled and isn't having much fun in Cincinnati, which has led to massive trade rumors, specifically to Pittsburgh and Las Vegas.

Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel, meanwhile, is very much on the hot seat. If the Dolphins don't finish strong, his job could be on the line.

📊 Prediction: Bengals 31 Dolphins 29

New York Jets @ New Orleans Saints

Odds: Saints -4.5 (ML: Jets +185, Saints -225 | Over/Under: 40.5 (via BetMGM)

Talk about a game that absolutely nobody should want to watch, unless you have an active interest in where these teams finish in the NFL Draft standings. Maybe if you're a friend or family member of one of the players.

Tyler Shough has proven that he's a halfway decent NFL quarterback! The Saints have won back-to-back games against the two best teams in the NFC South, and have won their last three in the conference.

Shough is also starting to use his legs much more often, rushing for 87 yards and two touchdowns over the last two games.

The Jets don't look good whatsoever. Honestly, we don't know how this team won three games this year. Saints in a minor blowout.

📊 Prediction: Saints 30 Jets 17

Minnesota Vikings @ New York Giants

Odds: Vikings -3 (ML: Vikings -152, Giants +128 | Over/Under: 43.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook)

Seriously, how many games do we have this weekend with two teams that are out of the playoffs with three games left to play? This is actually absurd.

I'm looking forward to this one, with J.J. McCarthy and Jaxson Dart given free passes to ball out with little-to-no risk.

One storyline to follow is the continued misuse of Justin Jefferson, who has been held to a combined six catches for 37 yards over the last three games. That's just over 12 yards per game for a player drafted high in the first round in every fantasy football draft this season.

📊 Prediction: Vikings 24 Giants 20

Tampa Bay Buccaneers @ Carolina Panthers

Odds: Buccaneers -3 (ML: Buccaneers -155, Panthers +130 | Over/Under: 47.5 (via DraftKings)

It's all on the line in Carolina as these two NFC South rivals play for the division in the first of two meetings to conclude the regular season.

While it feels that this is just going to be a typical Panthers loss, the Buccaneers have lost five of their last six games.

This is as unpredictable a game as there has been in the NFL this season. Chuba Hubbard and Rico Dowdle will have to have big games against the 10th-ranked run defense for the Panthers to pull this off.

📊 Prediction: Buccaneers 24 Panthers 21

NFL Sunday Late Afternoon

Jacksonville Jaguars @ Denver Broncos

Odds: Broncos -3 (ML: Jaguars +144, Broncos -172 | Over/Under: 45.5 (via FanDuel)

In a potential AFC playoff preview, the top-ranked Broncos host the third-ranked Jaguars in the second battle of two 10-win teams this season.

Both of these teams scored over 40 points last week, which pushed the over/under table up nearly three points.

The Broncos are one of the best defensive teams of all time, especially in the sacks department. Meanwhile, the Jaguars have the best run defense in all of football and will force Bo Nix to air the ball out.

The two Broncos losses this season have been against top-10 run defenses. We expect loss number three.

📊 Prediction: Jaguars 20 Broncos 16

Atlanta Falcons @ Arizona Cardinals

Odds: Falcons -2.5 (ML: Falcons -140, Cardinals +118 | Over/Under: 47.5 (via BetMGM)

We're back to the games pitting two teams out of playoff contention. We've got a great matchup between Bijan Robinson and Jacoby Brissett, who are both having phenomenal seasons despite team performances.

Drake London is still questionable after missing last week, though Kyle Pitts had a monster three-touchdown performance in his absence, undoubtedly the best game of his career.

We love the Falcons in a big way in this one.

📊 Prediction: Falcons 33 Cardinals 15

Pittsburgh Steelers @ Detroit Lions

Odds: Steelers -7 (ML: Steelers +260, Lions -325 | Over/Under: 51.5 (via DraftKings)

We cannot wait for this matchup, as it pits two playoff contenders who will be fighting for their lives in Detroit.

The Lions are the far more explosive team, while Aaron Rodgers has proven to be an impressive game manager for a well-balanced Steelers team this season.

The biggest mismatch should be Jahmyr Gibbs against one of the worst run defenses in football. He could easily go for over 200 yards, while Rodgers will continue to dink and dunk. That shouldn't be enough.

📊 Prediction: Lions 41 Steelers 20

Las Vegas Raiders @ Houston Texans

Odds: Texans -14.5 (ML: Raiders +750, Texans -1200 | Over/Under: 37.5 (via FanDuel)

The Houston Texans need this win as much as the Raiders need the number one pick next year.

We don't know how the Raiders are going to score against the number one defense in all of football, who are also the number one run defense in football.

The Raiders have scored 10 or fewer points six times this season and were shutout against the Eagles last week. They're horrible and the Texans shouldn't need to do much to come out as clear winners.

📊 Prediction: Texans 17 Raiders 3

New England Patriots @ Baltimore Ravens

Odds: Ravens -2.5 (ML: Patriots +130, Ravens -154 | Over/Under: 47.5 (via FanDuel)

This Tom Brady-era rivalry starts a new chapter with Drake Maye in MVP form against Lamar Jackson's Ravens, who have struggled to find their footing.

The Ravens will be far more desperate in this one, and they should find a way to get it done in what should be a thriller.

📊 Prediction: Ravens 30 Patriots 27

San Francisco 49ers @ Indianapolis Colts

Odds: 49ers -6.5 (ML: 49ers -300, Colts +245 | Over/Under: 46.5 (via FanDuel)

We loved seeing Philip Rivers out there balling out against the Seahawks, keeping the Colts in the game despite being two-touchdown underdogs.

Against the 49ers in his second game out there, we don't believe the same magic is going to come out. Expect Christian McCaffrey to have a fantastic game in Indianapolis.

📊 Prediction: 49ers 27 Colts 10

The players listed in this section have improved enough that they no longer need to be included on the injury report.","The Detroit Lions (8-6) and Pittsburgh Steelers (8-6) have declared their initial Week 16 injury reports as they prepare to face off in Week 16. Both teams are dealing with a few key injuries, especially on the defensive side of the ball.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

The Lions have used six of their eight return-from-injured-reserve spots—that includes Mahogany, who is currently in the injury evaluation window—leaving them two available for the remainder of the regular season. With Manu returning to practice, that makes seven. Wright have been seen at practice working with trainers, so he appears to have a better chance of returning than Cunningham, but it’s worth pointing out that Wright is not eligible to begin practicing until Week 18. However, if the Lions make the Ppayoffs, they are given an additional two return-from-IR spots, which they could use as needed.

Decker has routinely taken practices off throughout the season, even missing all three practices in Week 15, but the extra time off has worked, and he’s been available to play on game day. Expect him to continue to get time off as the season progresses.

Joseph suffered a setback last week, according to Campbell, and at this stage of the season, it’s fair to wonder if he will be able to recover from this latest obstacle in time to play this season.

Vaki has been able to practice and play through his thumb injury for a few weeks now, and he looks to be on that same track to start this week of practices.

Trystan Colon is a new addition to the injury report, but given some improved health at the guard position—more on that in a minute—he may be moved to a reserve role this week anyways.

Robertson injured his hand in Week 15 and needed to exit the game, but on Monday, coach Dan Campbell gave an optimistic update on his potential availability.

“Hand injury, so it’s something that could affect him a little bit. But I think we’d like to believe he’s going to have a chance to play here. But until we get through practice, we won’t entirely know,” Campbell said.

Mahogany continued to work through the injury evaluation window and could possibly return to game action this week. Last week, he was initially given a questionable designation on Friday before being ruled out on Saturday, suggesting he is making progress toward returning. A full practice could mean he returns to play on Sunday.

Awosika got in three limited practices last week, was given a questionable designation, but was ruled inactive just ahead of game time. It’s unclear if something happened in warmups or if his foot didn’t improve as expected, but a return to full practice this week suggests he’ll have a chance to help reinforce the Lions’ interior offensive line.

Harper participated in all three practices last week, but was not able clear the NFL’s concussion protocols on time to play in the game. A full practice suggests he’s near the end of concussion protocol, which is good timing since Erick Hallett was poached from the Lions practice squad this week.

The New England Patriots announced they signed linebacker Amari Gainer to the practice squad on Wednesday, following up their active roster addition of linebacker Chad Muma on Tuesday.

Gainer, 25, originally entered the league as an undrafted free agent with the Las Vegas Raiders in 2024, spending the entire season on their active roster before being released prior to the start of 2025. Gainer, who stands at 6-foot-3 and weighs 240 pounds, played five seasons at Florida State (2018-22) before finishing his career at North Carolina (2023).

Muma, 26, didn’t work out after being selected in the third round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Colts claimed him off waivers following final roster cuts earlier this season, before eventually cutting him themselves and re-signing him to the practice squad — doing their best to keep the incredible athlete (9.77 Relative Athletic Score) who has done well to establish himself as a key contributor on special teams.

For the second week in a row, the Cardinals will be without left tackle Paris Johnson Jr. (knee) and safety Jalen Thompson (hamstring). Jonathan Gannon ruled out the two players for Sunday's game prior to Wednesday's walkthrough, opening the door for rookie Josh Fryar to earn his second career start as the bookend tackle.

Because the Cardinals held a walkthrough, the practice designations are estimations.

Marvin Harrison Jr. was back at practice after missing the last two games with a heel injury. When asked how the wide receiver was doing, Gannon said Harrison felt ""good"" and they'll see how the rest of the week goes. It'd be a boost to a wide receiver room that, besides for the recently signed Jalen Brooks, only has Michael Wilson as a healthy receiver.

Cornerbacks Max Melton (heel) and Darren Hall (concussion), offensive linemen Kelvin Beachum (NIR-Rest) and Evan Brown (NIR-Personal), and outside linebacker Josh Sweat (NIR-Rest) did not take part in the walkthrough.

After missing the last five games, Dadrion Taylor-Demerson returned in a limited capacity. The safety has been dealing with an ankle injury. Linebacker Cody Simon (knee/ankle) and wide receiver Xavier Weaver (hamstring) were also limited.

Defensive lineman L.J. Collier logged his first full practice since his window was opened. The Cardinals can activate him to the 53-man roster by Saturday afternoon. There is an open roster spot available.

He was a limited participant, but was back on the grass with his team after missing the last four games with a PCL sprain in his knee.

Head coach Raheem Morris said the team will evaluate London this week to determine whether or not he can play in Arizona this weekend against the Cardinals.

""We'll get a chance to see where he's at, do a couple things with him,"" Morris said. ""He seems to be in positive spirits so we look forward to seeing how much he'll potentially be able to give us this week.""

Tight end Kyle Pitts has emerged in London's absence. He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week after his career day against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last Thursday night.

Through 14 games this season, Pitts has recorded 73 receptions for 797 yards and four touchdowns. Notably, he's had 24 catches and 383 yards with three touchdowns in the last three outings with London out of the lineup. How — and if — London's return changes production and usage for Pitts will be something to monitor.

With Pittsburgh closing out Week 15 in command of the AFC North, here are some of the biggest storylines coming out of the week.

Unfortunately for fans, Week 15 was headlined by injuries to star players, comebacks, and clarity on playoff positioning. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes left Sunday's 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers with a torn ACL, and his team was eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in his career. Mahomes already underwent surgery to repair the issue.

On the NFC side, Green Bay Packers trade acquisition Micah Parsons suffered a torn ACL in Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos. Parsons has totaled 12.5 sacks, 12 tackles for loss and a forced fumble in his first season with the Packers.

The Bills and Rams both had second-half comebacks on the road, both of which could have massive playoff implications down the line. The Bills' 21-point comeback gave them a 35-31 win over the Patriots, ending New England’s 10-game winning streak and a 120-game winning streak when leading by 17+ points at home. The Rams cut a 10-point deficit to beat the Lions 41-34.

The playoff chances for the Lions, Panthers and Colts took a huge hit after each suffered tough losses on Sunday. The Lions stumbled in the second half against the Rams in Jared Goff's return to LA, while the Panthers were stunned by the Saints. Forty-four-year-old Philip Rivers' return after a five-year absence was spoiled when a costly interception sealed a win for the Seahawks.

The Rams and Broncos both clinched their spots in the playoffs with their respective wins on Sunday, currently sitting as the No. 1 seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively.

The Kansas City Chiefs took a couple of major losses on Sunday as they were eliminated from the playoffs and star quarterback Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL.

The Los Angeles Chargers beat the Chiefs 16-13 at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday, but the biggest loss was Mahomes’ devastating injury.

Travis Kelce reacted to the injury, saying ""s--- just sucks.""

""We lost our quarterback, Patty Mahomes, our guy, our brother, our fearless leader, our face of the franchise, to an ACL. It’s never easy seeing your guys go down. We had a bunch of guys get hurt this past game, and we fought. We fought, we had some guys fight through some stuff,"" Kelce said during a recent episode of his podcast, ""New Heights.""

""On a freakish play to see (Mahomes) go down like that man, it f---ing – it was almost like it wasn’t real and s--- just sucks, man. For a guy that puts in that much and puts his body on the line week in week out and makes this football world – he makes the best of it by how hard he works, and it sucks.""

Mahomes got hurt late in the fourth quarter with the team down 16-13 and trying to come back, and backup Gardner Minshew came into the game. Kelce praised Minshew for battling, despite the backup throwing the game-sealing interception to end the Chiefs' playoff hopes.

PATRICK MAHOMES' KNEE INJURY WORSE THAN INITIALLY THOUGHT AFTER MONDAY SURGERY: REPORT

Kelce had seven catches for 70 yards in the Chiefs’ loss to the Chargers. In 14 games this season, the 10-time Pro Bowler has 67 catches for 797 yards and five touchdowns.

It is the first time the Chiefs have missed the playoffs since 2014, and Kelce, in his 13th season, noted that he is the only player on the roster who has played a regular-season game that does not have playoff implications.

It was a rough week for high-profile injuries, with Patrick Mahomes and Micah Parsons tearing their ACLs and Davante Adams aggravating a hamstring injury.

There can be a whole conversation about what Mahomes’ injury means for his career and the Chiefs’ place in history, but situations like this are once-a-decade so there isn’t much to judge from historically. Instead I want to focus on what we could learn about the Parsons and Adams injuries and their return (next year for Parsons, this year for Adams).

Davante Adams

The Rams’ No. 2 receiver aggravated a mild hamstring injury in the win over the Lions. He had been playing through it, continuing a strong campaign in which he easily leads the league with 14 receiving touchdowns.

The touchdowns are a bit of a distraction from the fact that he ranks 34th in receptions, 25th in yards, and 46th in EPA, but his individual contributions have been notable in that they’ve somewhat unlocked Puka Nacua as well.

Rams Receiving Production, 2024-25

Targets EPA Total Points Cooper Kupp 2024 100 4 7 Davante Adams 2025 113 22 18 Puka Nacua 2024 106 62 36 Puka Nacua 2025 128 89 51

Remember that Total Points is our total player value metric that operates in the same currency as EPA. So Adams is outperforming Cooper Kupp’s 2024, but his individual contribution isn’t as extreme as the total productivity of his targets (taking into account the play of others). Nacua was excellent last year, but he’s been otherworldly this year. And there are three games left to pad these totals.

As for what to expect for the rest of Adams’ season, the Rams’ playoff standing is relevant. Depending on the severity of the strain, hamstring injuries could linger for a few weeks, and there are also ramifications on Adams’ productivity once he does return.

Taking a sample from our injury data, the average games missed for a Grade 1 strain is around one game, while a Grade 2 strain is closer to three games. But it should also be noted that even the first game or two back from the injury could be a problem.

I looked at about 30 wide receiver hamstring injuries over the last several seasons and how much/well they played upon their return, compared to their previous year’s average.

The results (as seen in the 2 images below) suggest that we should expect Adams to see a slight drop-off in playing time in his first several games, and his per-play output will take a couple games to return to normal.

Micah Parsons

The preseason trade of Parsons was one of the stories of the year, and he was having a strong season up until his knee injury this past weekend. Parsons was second in the NFL in pressures and third in sacks despite being eighth in pass rush snaps, unsurprisingly ranking as one of the best pass rushers in the NFL per Total Points.

In terms of the overall impact to the team, the Packers gained about 4 percentage points on their team pressure rate over last year. Parsons continued to be a weak run defender (below-zero Total Points, which is roughly replacement-level), but Green Bay roughly treaded water in terms of run defense EPA per play and success rate (improved in the former, declined in the latter).

In looking at a recent sample of 11 edge rushers who tore their ACLs and played at least 9 games after the injury, we can expect a pretty meaningful productivity drop-off in the year following Parson’s return.

Edge rusher productivity changes following an ACL tear

Difference Difference (as %) Snaps per G -5 -12% Total Points per play -0.01 -25% Snap-to-Pressure time +0.23 s -20%*

* If we assume a floor of 1.5 seconds on this metric

The average age for this group at the time of the injury was 26, same as Parsons, so we don’t have a strong reason to suspect his recovery will be notably better. And the late injury opens up the possibility that he’ll miss time to start off 2026, let alone the above concerns once he does suit up.

For now, the Packers will have to make do without their top defensive player, and that’s coming on the heels of losing DT Devonte Wyatt for the season. For Rashan Gary, the pressure is on (pun not intended), especially since his first seven games were worth 25 Total Points compared to just 6 over his last seven games.",https://www.sportsinfosolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Micah-Parsons-and-Davante-Adams.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 16:03:05.374535

While the data-charting process is, by nature, objective, our team will obviously form opinions about what they saw, given that we have to watch every play multiple times.

Every week, we’ll select the most notable observations and back them up with the objective data we’ve become known for.

Here are our top observations for 2025 NFL Week 15.

Week 15 Data Charter Observations

1. “Puka Nacua has really showcased himself as a truly complete WR. The types of routes he was running down the field were magnificent to watch, and Nacua has some of the best hands in the entire NFL. Seeing a more diverse route tree is encouraging because Puka is showing he can dominate at all levels of the field and is still a nightmare to tackle after the catch. It’s no longer a Rashee Rice type of route tree, but a true #1 at all levels. With Davante Adams out, expect more Puka down the field.”

The Rams dropped 40 points for the second straight game and improved their record to 11-3 following a 41-34 shootout win over the Lions in Week 15. Rams’ WR Puka Nacua stole the show on offense for the Rams to the tune of 9 catches for 181 yards, while picking up 8 first downs, which helped the Rams sustain drives. Nacua was uncoverable in this game by posting an insane 0.385 ASS, including a positive ASS on slants, outs, go’s, corners, and crossers against the Lions’ secondary. After having some down games in the middle of the season, Nacua has racked up 16 catches, 348 receiving yards, and 2 TDs in the past two weeks, reminding people that he is one of the NFL’s elite WRs.

Matthew Stafford remained at the forefront of the MVP race with 368 passing yards, 2 TDs, and 1 INT on 24 of 38 passing in Week 15. What makes this offense nearly impossible to stop is Stafford’s ability to connect with TEs out of the heavy sets that have become a staple in the Rams' offense. TEs Colby Parkinson, Davis Allen, and Terrance Ferguson combined for 9 catches, 97 yards, and 2 TDs, not including another would-be touchdown for Ferguson on a throw that was just out of his reach. The Rams kick off Week 16 with a road matchup with the Seahawks in what will have major implications in the race for the NFC West and the #1 seed in the NFC.

2. “James Cook was the story for the Bills offense. Josh Allen turned it on when the Bills got behind, but outside of Allen, James Cook showed why he is one of the best RBs in the NFL. He took advantage of a Patriots’ defense that is lacking some of its starters by consistently ripping off big gains. Even when the Patriots were able to contact him near the line of scrimmage, Cook was able to bounce off contact and fall forward for extra yardage to help the Bills stay ahead of the chains.”

Despite falling behind 21-0 in the first half, the Bills were able to shorten the Patriots’ lead in the AFC East with a 35-31 win in New England. RB James Cook carried the Bills’ offense for stretches in this game with 111 total yards and 3 total TDs on 24 touches. Although Cook failed to register an explosive run, he was able to consistently pick up positive yardage behind a Bills’ offensive line that paved the way for an excellent 3.91 YBCO/ATT average, including just a 31.8% stuff rate. He was also able to show off his elusiveness by forcing 7 missed tackles, giving him 44 on the season (t-3rd most among RBs).

When the Bills needed it, QB Josh Allen put on his Superman cape with 158 passing yards and 2 TDs in the second half, resulting in 193 passing yards and 3 TDs for the game. Allen exploited matchups with his TEs as Dawson Knox and Dalton Kincaid accounted for 71 yards and 2 TDs. The Bills head to Cleveland to take on the Browns, before hosting a marquee matchup with the Eagles in Week 17.

3. “Bo Nix with the game of his life versus Green Bay! Denver finally put together a complete game, one won thanks to Bo Nix and his second-half ability on Sunday. Nix was forced off his first read a ton, ranking 30th among 35 QBs in week 15 with a first-read % of just 50%. He combined that second reaction ability with some serious HERO throws maximizing the play. Nix ranked 5th on the week with a 11.8% HERO rate.”

The Broncos put a stranglehold on the race for the number one seed in the AFC following a 34-26 win over the Packers at home. Much has been made of Bo Nix’s accuracy issues this season and he responded with his best game of the season. Nix completed 23 of 34 passes for 302 yards and 4 TDs against a Packers’ defense that had been stingy against the pass all season. With his latest performance, Nix cracked the top 10 in passing yards on the season with 3,256 and the top 5 in passing touchdowns with 23.

Nix’s main targets were WRs Courtland Sutton and Troy Franklin as Sutton posted a 7/113/1 statline and Franklin posted a 6/85/1 statline. Sutton especially balled out by posting a 0.300 ASS, which ranked 6th best in Week 15 among WRs with at least 10 routes. The Broncos host another high-profile matchup in Week 16 as they take on the Jaguars with a chance to clinch home-field advantage on the line.

4. “Kyle Pitts’ aDOT has been much higher the past two games than his previous games with Kirk Cousins starting, but his production has remained great as he’s seen dramatic increases in Air Yards share, YAC/rec, YPRR, and 1st read share. Drake London won’t always be out, and Kindle Vildor won’t always be in coverage, but he’s looked like the freak athlete who was drafted 4th overall and crushed in his rookie year.”

Week 15 kicked off with the Falcons mounting an improbable fourth-quarter comeback in a 29-28 win over the Bucs on Thursday Night Football. Many fantasy managers were left stunned as TE Kyle Pitts exploded for 166 receiving yards and 3 TDs on 11 catches. Over the last three weeks, Pitts ranks 4th in the NFL in receiving yards at 338, while posting a 33.9% air yards share, a 20.2% target share, and an 82.8% catch rate. QB Kirk Cousins has been locked into Pitts since Drake London has been out of the lineup.

Speaking of Cousins, Captain Kirk dialed it back to his early years by pacing the NFL in passing yards in Week 15 with 373 passing yards and the 3 TDs to Pitts on 30 of 44 passing. Cousins did a good job of taking care of the ball by posting just a 2.3% TWT and looked like he still has something left in the tank after that performance. The Falcons head to Arizona to square up with the Cardinals, who have allowed 40+ points in back-to-back games.

5. “Jacksonville scored at will. Before pulling the starters, they scored on eight out of nine drives. Trevor Lawrence looked like the QB we were promised, maybe for the first time in his career? The Jets' defense couldn’t stop anything. Interesting nugget: Brian Thomas Jr. stayed on the field once the starters and other WRs were pulled. He kept seeing snaps after Jakobi Meyers and Parker Washington’s days were done.”

The Jaguars improved to 10-4 on the season following a 48-20 blowout win over the Jets in Week 15. QB Trevor Lawrence had a career game with 330 passing yards and 5 TDs with no INTs to go along with 51 yards and another score on the ground. HC Liam Coen has been a godsend for Lawrence this season, helping him play some of the best football of his career. Over the past four games, Lawrence ranks 5th in the NFL with 1,059 passing yards and ranks 1st in passing touchdowns with 12.

In his third game back from injury, Brian Thomas Jr. played deep into the game, but did turn in a good performance with 4 catches for 66 yards and 1 TD. I chalk it up to the Jags trying to get BTJ back on track after Jakobi Meyers had taken over as the focal point of the Jags’ passing game. The Jaguars will need BTJ to step up in a road matchup against the Broncos on tap for Week 16.

6. “The Chargers ran a hilarious amount of heavy personnel, utilizing an extra lineman at tight end (Trevor Penning), along with a healthy dose of Will Dissly and Scott Matlock. This allowed Oronde Gadsden to get a little more use out of the slot, and without Quentin Johnston, Tre Harris dominated the outside-receiver reps. The heavy personnel allowed the Chargers to play more bully ball against the Chiefs, and boy did they put the hurt on the Chiefs linebackers. Nick Bolton, especially, was in and out of the lineup nursing injuries early on.”

The Chargers put an end to the Chiefs’ playoff hopes with a 16-13 win in Arrowhead. While nursing an injury to his off hand, QB Justin Herbert grinded out 210 yards, 1 TD, and 1 INT on 19 of 29 passing. Since Herbert broke his hand in Week 13, the Chargers have turned to a more run-heavy approach by posting a negative pass rate over expectation in all three games. RBs Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal combined to carry the ball 27 times for 94 yards against a tough Chiefs’ defense. As Hampton works his way back from an ankle injury, I would expect him to get more work as he leads the Chargers with a 7.4% explosive run rate on the season. The Chargers will need Herbert to return to his pre-injury form in a potential shootout in Dallas against the Cowboys in Week 16.

Bonus Observations

Rams RB Blake Corum — Corum continues to add a nice change of pace to the backfield and inevitably is helping Kyren Williams stay healthy and effective. Seeing Corum’s explosiveness is a little surprising, just because Kyren and Corum have always seemed like very interchangeable pieces with similar play styles. I stand corrected however, as Corum is showing more explosiveness than Kyren has. Corum has posted a 16.7% explosive run rate over the past three weeks, averaging over 70 rushing yards per game.

Chargers RB Kimani Vidal — Vidal has really created a role for himself in this offense. He is a low-to-the-ground runner with just enough explosiveness to hit the second level quickly. Although Omarion Hampton appears to be the better back, Vidal is effective in pass protection and demonstrated reliability during the weeks Hampton was injured. I believe the confidence in Vidal allows the Chargers to ease Hampton back not only as a rookie, but as someone who had a fracture. We could see more and more Hampton as the weeks progress, but Vidal seems like he can at least sustain the third-down role. Vidal ran a route 57.6% of dropbacks to Hampton’s 18.2% in Week 15, showing that the Chargers will likely maintain a rotation at RB moving forward.

Raiders RB Ashton Jeanty — Jeanty is just constantly getting hit in the backfield and it’s impossible to get a full picture of what he can do. His yards before contact and stuff rates are abysmal, and even when he makes a defender miss, there’s usually another guy there to clean it up. I think it’s fair to have questions about his long speed at this level compared to college, but he has looked very good in these terrible circumstances. Jeanty has been stuffed on 54.0% of runs (3rd highest) while averaging just 1.35 YBCO/ATT (4th lowest).

Commanders RB Jacory Croskey-Merritt — JCM has life. After weeks of playing behind Chris Rodriguez, JCM took full advantage of Rodriguez's absence from this game. He consistently picked up chunks of yards and gave himself something to build on for the rest of this season and heading into next season. JCM posted 96 yards and 1 TD on 18 carries while playing on over 50% of the snaps for the first time since Week 8.",https://static.fantasypts.com/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-17 17:06:23.619441

Green Bay Packers Power Rankings

USA Today: 7th

In general, the Packers fell from about a top-5 team to a top-10 team across the board in power rankings after the loss of Parsons. The highest I’ve seen Green Bay ranked in a power rankings list is 7th, by USA Today’s Nate Davis. Here’s what Davis had to say about the Packers:

Will the loss of DE Micah Parsons to an ACL tear have a bigger impact on the Pack’s defense or its collective psyche?

Don’t expect a lot of non-Parsons analysis this week from the national media. Correctly, that’s taking up a lot of the airtime around the team.

For the most part, Connor Orr of Sports Illustrated has been the lowest analyst on the Packers throughout the year, but Green Bay jumped up to 4th overall in his power rankings last week…before dropping down to just 12th this week. Here’s what Orr had to say about the team:

The Packers have had non-stop blender games this month and now return to Chicago for another matchup against a Bears team that was one throw away from clipping them last time. Their ability to handle attrition will be on full display as the NFC North looks primed to shapeshift again.

Personally, I think Green Bay was much closer to blowing the Bears out than Chicago was to winning that game, as virtually every call went their way two weeks ago. Still, I’m not sure the Packers should be favored in Chicago this week, like how the books have it. We’re going to learn a lot about this team on Saturday.",https://platform.acmepackingcompany.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/12/gettyimages-2251923983.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-12-17 14:02:22.832994

On the longer end was defensive end Rashan Gary, who played 308 days after tearing ACL on Nov. 6, 2022.
In the middle was Elgton Jenkins, who played 302 days after his ACL tear on Nov. 21, 2021.","GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Micah Parsons has not yet had surgery to repair the torn left ACL he suffered Sunday, but it hasn't been unusual for Green Bay Packers players to wait several days or even a week before undergoing reconstructive knee surgery.

The date of the surgery will help determine when Parsons could play next season, but based on the last three Packers starters who had ACL reconstruction, the team can expect to open next season without their star edge rusher.

""He's about to have another child here pretty quick,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Tuesday when asked if Parsons underwent surgery yet. ""Not that that's going to impact the specific timeline of the surgery, but he's down there dealing with that.""

LaFleur said he did not know where or with which doctor Parsons planned to have his surgery.

If Parsons' timeline follows the most recent Packers player to undergo that surgery, it's possible he could miss only the first three games of the season. That's based on reports that the 2026 NFL season is expected to open with a Thursday night game on Sept. 10.

Christian Watson, who tore his ACL in the final week of last year's regular season, was back 294 days after his injury, making his return the fastest among their last three starters to suffer the same injury during the season. On the Watson timeline, Parsons would be able to play on Oct. 4 -- which would be the Sunday of Week 4.

On the longer end was defensive end Rashan Gary, who played 308 days after tearing ACL on Nov. 6, 2022. It's possible Gary could have played sooner, because his return was the 2023 season opener. That timeline would mean Parsons could miss the first four to six games depending on what day the Packers play and/or if they have an early season bye.

In the middle was Elgton Jenkins, who played 302 days after his ACL tear on Nov. 21, 2021. He returned in Week 2 of the 2022 season. That timeline would mean Parsons could miss the first four or five games depending on what day the Packers played that week and/or if they have an early-season bye.

Other factors in Parsons' return include potential setbacks during his recovery and whether any other parts of his left knee needed to be repaired. Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who tore an ACL just hours before Parsons did, had surgery Monday; he also had a tear to his LCL.

""I don't want to get into the specifics,"" LaFleur said when asked if Parsons had any other injuries. ""I just know it was the ACL in my conversations, but as far as the specifics of it, I'm not going to get into it.""

What Comes Next? - The Ringer,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theringer.com/2025/12/16/nfl/whats-next-for-kansas-city-chiefs-eliminated-playoffs-patrick-mahomes-acl-injury,"In the past few years, the word that has come up more and more to describe the Kansas City Chiefs has been inevitable.
This season, Mahomes has had career lows in completion percentage and completion percentage when pressured and a career high in rushing yards.
Still, Kansas City could use a defensive lineman other than 31-year-old Chris Jones who can be a reliable down-to-down playmaker.
It seems likely that Veach will be in Kansas City for a long time.
And earlier this month, a shocking call in the fourth quarter against the Texans cost the Chiefs the game.","In the past few years, the word that has come up more and more to describe the Kansas City Chiefs has been inevitable. Kansas City has played in the past three Super Bowls and the past seven AFC championship games, and it’s made the past 10 playoffs, a run that covers the entire duration of the Patrick Mahomes–Andy Reid era. Inevitable, such that any perceived fragility––a bad record or a misleading one, a roster weakness or a star’s bad season––began to underscore the Chiefs’ ultimate strength: They were never out even when they were down. An 11-6 regular season in 2023 gave way to a Super Bowl win; poor underlying metrics in last year’s 15-2 season didn’t prove costly until the Chiefs were already AFC champions. Inevitable, so that even early struggles this season seemed incidental, like a test to see who might dare predict the sun to rise in the west the next day.

That cloak of inevitability came off on Sunday, as the first major chapter of Mahomes’s career in Kansas City and the best run in franchise history ended in a 16-13 loss to the Chargers that, because of wins by Buffalo, Houston, and Jacksonville, eliminated the Chiefs from playoff contention 11 days before Christmas. There was no Mahomes magic that could save them. The two-time MVP tore his ACL on a fourth-quarter scramble, the first season-ending injury of his career. So, for the first time in a decade, the Chiefs will close out the regular season thinking not about a potential playoff run, but about rehab and recovery, reps for younger players, and possible retirement for older ones as they head into an offseason that will be an inflection point in this franchise’s arc.

If there is good news for Kansas City here, it is that this lost season may serve as a needed wake-up call about the state of the roster. Outside of retooling the offensive line—highlighted by the selection of left tackle Josh Simmons in the first round of the draft—Reid and general manager Brett Veach did not make many significant changes last offseason and instead relied on continuity. That could be a reasonable reaction to three consecutive Super Bowl trips, but perhaps they were overlooking the number of lucky bounces it took to get the Chiefs there. Kansas City’s 11 wins in one-score games last year were the most in a season in NFL history, but that luck regressed in serious fashion this year. The Chiefs’ record in one-score games is currently 1-7, worst in the NFL, despite the fact that their plus-60-point differential is actually better than last year’s team’s.

There should be some comfort in that, but this is still a roster with clear holes. Over the course of the past couple of seasons, the Chiefs have transformed from a team that wins with explosive offense to one that’s reliant on defense and efficiency. The lack of speed and playmaking has become a clear weakness that’s been exploited by opponents. It’s darkly fitting that Mahomes’s season ended with a scramble as he desperately tried to create something out of nothing on a play in which he lacked good options downfield. This season, Mahomes has had career lows in completion percentage and completion percentage when pressured and a career high in rushing yards.

The Chargers’ defensive game plan succeeded on Sunday, and they won in the same way opponents like the Bills have beaten the Chiefs this year—they were able to get pressure on Mahomes without blitzing and covered Kansas City’s receivers one-on-one. Veach can’t let this roster go into next season without a better solution than this year’s plan, which was mainly to have Mahomes throw a lot of short, quick passes. According to Next Gen Stats and ESPN, Mahomes attempted 244 passes in less than 2.5 seconds this season, the most in the NFL. That could mean once again prioritizing better protection for Mahomes so that he is forced into fewer quick throws and scrambles, or finally adding receivers who are better at getting separation.

The bad news for Veach is that the Chiefs are currently near the bottom of the league in salary cap space, although they could clear at least $60 million in room by restructuring Mahomes’s contract and releasing penalty-prone right tackle Jawaan Taylor, who has a nearly $20 million non-guaranteed 2026 salary. The team should also have some answers for its receiver issues that are already on the roster. A true top boundary pass catcher would probably have to come via a trade, but because of injuries and Rashee Rice’s suspension to start the year, Mahomes rarely had a full complement of active pass catchers this season..

Worthy’s usage and production (40 receptions, 491 yards, one touchdown) have been underwhelming given that the team hoped the speedy receiver would help make the team more explosive in his second season. Although Pro Football Focus’s charting has deemed him responsible for only one drop this season (in the game against Indianapolis, although he also dropped a deep pass in a high-profile moment against Dallas), he’s become a poster child for the ways this receiving corps has let Mahomes down. Per PFF, the Chiefs have 23 total drops so far this season, tied for the seventh most in the league. But it’s worth giving the 22-year-old receiver some time to develop and hoping that Reid and offensive coordinator Matt Nagy will take a closer look at how they’re using him. Worthy was often tasked with running complex routes over the middle, a big ask for his experience level and slight physical build He’s also not been entirely healthy since suffering a dislocated shoulder from a collision with Kelce in Week 1. Still, it’s clear that Worthy is not on a WR1 trajectory and doesn’t have the size or consistency to be that kind of player. But the Chiefs can probably find better ways to maximize his skill set in the future.

Getting more explosive also has to mean fixing the run game. According to ESPN, the Chiefs entered Sunday’s game against the Chargers with the lowest explosive run rate, meaning plays of 20 yards or more, on running back carries in all seasons since 2000. This stems from Reid and Nagy’s reliance on shotgun runs and RPOs as the bread and butter of this part of their run scheme, something that’s drawn a lot of criticism from analysts this season. In terms of personnel, Kansas City may be due for a much-needed running back overhaul; Isiah Pacheco, Kareem Hunt, and Elijah Mitchell are all set to hit free agency.

As much as this can be true of a team quarterbacked by Mahomes, defense has been the Chiefs’ focus for the past few years and, accordingly, is the part of the roster that’s in better shape. Still, Kansas City could use a defensive lineman other than 31-year-old Chris Jones who can be a reliable down-to-down playmaker. The Chiefs have just 18.5 sacks by defensive linemen this season, a sign that they’ve had to rely on exotic blitz packages to create any pressure.

None of those are easy fixes. But they’re the types of roster questions that teams, even good ones, deal with every year––dollars and cents and targets and pressures.

Then there are the roster questions that have a bit more complexity to them. Mahomes and Kelce are the two most visible Chiefs players, and it’s unclear how or whether either of them will enter the 2026 season. Kelce, who turned 36 in October, seems likely to retire, a decision he’s said he would share before the start of free agency in March. Mahomes is obviously not going anywhere in the long term, but he will miss at least the offseason while he recovers from ACL surgery, which was performed on Monday night. This is the most significant injury of his career, and even if he has a smooth and speedy recovery, he could miss regular-season games next year In the coming months, the Chiefs will have to decide how much they want to invest in a backup quarterback from a pool of pending free agents that includes players like Marcus Mariota and Joe Flacco. Cash is tight and good backups don’t come cheap, but Mahomes is currently the only passer on Kansas City’s roster who’s under contract for next season. The Chiefs have to figure that a backup will be leading the team through significant chunks of the offseason—and potentially beyond.

Even in the longer term, Kansas City’s leadership will have to evolve, a strange reality for a team whose strategy has prioritized continuity. Jones will be 32 at the start of next season. Kicker Harrison Butker, who has been with the Chiefs since 2017, has missed eight kicks so far this season (four field goals and four extra points), and his mistakes have been a major contributor to Kansas City’s poor record in close games

The Chiefs have had a decent draft record under Veach, and they need to find the team’s next generation of stars and develop them around Mahomes if they want to resume their dynasty. The best historical comparison for this is the Patriots in the late 2000s—just like Tom Brady, Mahomes tore his ACL during his ninth season, with three Super Bowl rings to his name. That precedent should be somewhat encouraging for the Chiefs. But from 2010 to 2012, the Patriots drafted Rob Gronkowski, Devin McCourty, Nate Solder, Marcus Cannon, Chandler Jones, and Dont’a Hightower, retooling the roster for the next set of championship runs a few years later. The Chiefs have to prove that they can get that part right, too.

It seems likely that Veach will be in Kansas City for a long time. It’s less clear whether Reid will be, though. He is 67, and for the first time in a while, there have been meaningful questions about his decision-making throughout the season. Besides the schematic gripes about the overreliance on RPOs and working out of the shotgun, Reid (and Nagy, who have a hybrid play calling arrangement in which Nagy relays calls to Mahomes but Reid ultimately chooses them) has had a few high-profile situational blunders.

In a loss to Dallas on Thanksgiving, Reid chose to punt on a fourth-and-4 from the opposing 44-yard line in the third quarter, after which the Cowboys used the following possession to extend their lead. And earlier this month, a shocking call in the fourth quarter against the Texans cost the Chiefs the game. With the score tied, Reid elected to go for it on fourth-and-1 from Kansas City’s own 31-yard line. That alone was risky, but the play call—a pass from the shotgun, instead of a run—was indefensible, and Reid admitted after the game that it was a mistake. Reid is likely in no danger of being fired, and I’m pretty sure that most Chiefs fans wouldn’t wish for a coaching change. But it’s fair to say that the coach who has been the heart and soul of Kansas City’s organization has seemed a little off his game this year.

It’s worth noting that these are, mostly, NFL-style Champagne problems. There is major change coming—and that is necessary—but this team is still very similar to last year’s. That’s true in ways both good and bad, but that 2024 team that got to the Super Bowl was very lucky, just like this team was very unlucky—and those bounces should even out in the future. It’s reasonable to have faith that Mahomes will cut down on the red zone turnovers for example, without the Chiefs having to do much to make it happen. The Chiefs’ kicker, Butker or otherwise, probably won’t miss so many pivotal kicks again anytime soon. Kansas City probably won’t lose a game again because its best defender couldn’t tackle Trevor Lawrence—on a play in which he had already fallen on his rear. It will also, for the first time, have an offseason that’s not abridged by multiple weeks of playoff games and preparation.

But this is a moment of major change for the Chiefs. It seems likely that we’ll look back on 2025 as the closing of Mahomes’s first chapter, and this offseason will do a lot to shape how the next one begins. If Kelce retires, there’ll be a lot of tangible production that needs to be replaced, a tricky quarterback health situation to manage, and a growing leadership vacuum to fill.

And there’s also the question of what it means for the Chiefs and their opponents if they no longer seem inevitable. Their own results aside, this season has revealed new challengers around the league, like the Patriots with Drake Maye, the Broncos, and the Packers, the next generation of contenders—who don’t, or don’t yet, have the baggage of being also-rans (like Buffalo or Baltimore) in an era with a single most dominant team.

Yet another piece of uncharted territory for the Chiefs is learning how to win once you know you can lose—when you’re not inevitable. In the ESPN docuseries The Kingdom, about the 2024 Chiefs, there’s sideline footage of Jones speaking to defensive end George Karlaftis during the Super Bowl loss to the Eagles. “We’ve been so spoiled over the last three years.

-- On if Zach Tom, who left Sunday with a knee injury, can play Saturday: ""We'll see.
-- On Micah Parsons: LaFleur confirmed Parsons has an ACL tear, but he said Parsons has not had surgery and isn't sure when it will happen.
-- On Josh Jacobs, who played through a knee injury: ""He's battling through.""","Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur provided injury updates on several players coming out of Sunday's loss to the Denver Broncos. With a game on Saturday night this week, Tuesday serves functionally as the team's Wednesday, so an injury report will be coming later Tuesday.

The players referenced by LaFleur on Tuesday included receiver Christian Watson, edge rusher Micah Parsons, right tackle Zach Tom, edge rusher Lukas Van Ness, running back MarShawn Lloyd, safety Evan Williams, edge rusher Brenton Cox Jr. and running back Josh Jacobs.

The injury updates from LaFleur's Tuesday press conference:

-- On all the injuries: ""This injury list is pretty substantial. We got a lot of things to figure out in next couple days."" The Packers play the Chicago Bears on Saturday night.

-- On if Zach Tom, who left Sunday with a knee injury, can play Saturday: ""We'll see. I know he's going to fight and try to. We'll give him the week.""

-- On if Christian Watson can play Saturday against the Bears: ""Not quite sure. We'll give him up to game time."" Not just a pain tolerance issue with chest/shoulder, but also a functional issue. Needs to prove he can play through it during the week. On Sunday, the Packers sent him to a local Denver hospital to ensure Watson was OK. ""Thankfully everything checked out good.""

-- On Micah Parsons: LaFleur confirmed Parsons has an ACL tear, but he said Parsons has not had surgery and isn't sure when it will happen. Parsons is currently in Dallas awaiting the birth of his child, but LaFleur expects him to be around the team in Green Bay while on injured reserve. He wouldn't get into specifics about the injury other than needing surgery to fix the ACL.

-- On Lukas Van Ness, who returned from a foot injury on Sunday: ""I thought Van Ness was definitely a boost for us."" Like what he saw in terms of energy and playstyle in his return. The 2023 first-rounder will play a big role in helping replace Parsons at edge rusher.

-- On Brenton Cox Jr, who could return from IR: ""He's been looking good in practice. We'll see what that amounts to over the course of the week."" Cox could be activated from IR to replace Parsons on the 53-man roster.

-- On MarShawn Lloyd, who injured his hamstring while designated for return from IR: ""It's one of those things that's very, very unfortunate. To be in that spot again, what do you say to him?"" LaFleur said he feels ""extremely bad"" for Lloyd, who is likely to remain on injured reserve and miss the rest of the season.

-- LaFleur said Evan Williams, who has a knee injury, is another player who would be given the week to see if he can play Saturday.

-- On Josh Jacobs, who played through a knee injury: ""He's battling through."" LaFleur said Jacobs would not practice if the Packers were doing more than a walk-through on Tuesday. He said Jacobs got hit in the knee early in the game on Sunday and had to battle through it the rest of the way.","https://packerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/14/SPAC/87767757007-usatsi-27817490.jpg?crop=3610,2031,x0,y200&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-17 13:02:36.543126

I’ve been frustrated this whole season missing games.
He aggravated his elbow injury in the third quarter of Washington’s Week 14 loss to the Vikings, a 31-0 shutout that officially eliminated the Commanders from playoff contention.
Only four of Daniels’ starts this season went all four quarters.
Adding to Daniels’ frustration, however, is the belief that at least two of his injuries were fluke incidents.","ASHBURN, Va. — Jayden Daniels described his injury-riddled 2025 season as “frustrating” and “disappointing” and wholly unlike anything he or the Commanders expected.

“A lot more emotions,” he said Tuesday in his first comments since coach Dan Quinn announced the quarterback will not play in Washington’s final three games. “… I don’t wanna miss games at all. I’ve been frustrated this whole season missing games. I want to be out there with my teammates as much as possible, so it’s just been a frustrating year at this point in the year, but you learn from it when you move forward.”

After leading the Commanders to a 12-5 finish and earning offensive rookie of the year honors last season, Daniels suffered three injuries this season — a knee sprain in Week 2 against the Green Bay Packers, a low-grade hamstring strain in Week 7 against the Dallas Cowboys and a dislocated elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks — that limited him to seven games. He aggravated his elbow injury in the third quarter of Washington’s Week 14 loss to the Vikings, a 31-0 shutout that officially eliminated the Commanders from playoff contention.

Only four of Daniels’ starts this season went all four quarters. And only two of his appearances resulted in wins. He’s the only quarterback in NFL history to win offensive rookie of the year and then play as few as seven games the next season, according to Next Gen Stats.

Yet, he was hardly alone in Washington’s training room this year.

The Commanders endured an eight-game losing streak, partly because of a rash of injuries across their roster; two dozen players — mostly starters — missed 111 combined games this season.

Adding to Daniels’ frustration, however, is the belief that at least two of his injuries were fluke incidents.

“Other than that one game I missed for the hamstring, I mean, my knee and obviously my elbow, those aren’t things that you could really necessarily prepare for,” he said. “Those are freak accidents and things like that, so it’s most definitely frustrating and, at that time, I would say, traumatic and stuff like that.”

Following the Commanders’ loss in Minnesota, Quinn said Daniels could have gone back in the game but that the coach ultimately decided to keep him out because he felt the game was too far out of reach. But the next morning, Daniels said he felt discomfort in the elbow.

“I mean, adrenaline is a hell of a drug,” Daniels said with a smile. “… But things change when stuff settles down.”

Although further testing showed no structural damage to the joint, the doctors advised sitting him for the final stretch of the season. The medical staff has yet to clear him for contact, and Daniels said he wouldn’t have been cleared in time for Saturday’s game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

“It was obviously disappointing,” he said. “I’m a competitor, I want to play.

“… Now I’m focused on getting healthy and preparing for next year.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/02230538/GettyImages-2244693476-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-17 12:02:50.212267

Here are some quick highlights as he prepares his team to travel this week for a rematch against the Chicago Bears.

Josh Jacobs shows ‘he’s as tough as they come’ after banging injured knee early in Denver

The nature of Josh Jacobs’ physical running style means the Packers tailback might have to continue battling through a knee injury for the rest of this season.

The Packers got a reminder of that early in their game against the Broncos. Jacobs took a shot to his knee on a short-yardage run in the first quarter. LaFleur did not say on what run the contact occurred, but Jacobs took a shot to his knees against Broncos safety Talanoa Hufanga on a third-and-1 pitch to the left side. Hufanga dropped Jacobs for a 2-yard loss after blowing up a block on the perimeter from Packers tight end Josh Whyle, who was concussed on the play.

Jacobs bent over at his waist after getting up to his feet, appearing to be in pain.

“He’s battling through,” LaFleur said. “This guy is as tough as they come. So I’ll never count him out of the fight, I’ll tell you that. But if we were practicing today, absolutely he would not practice.”

Jacobs did not have a carry on the Packers’ following drive, a 10-play possession that ended with a field goal. But he returned to have one of his best games this season, including his first 40-yard run in 30 games with the Packers on a touchdown early in the third quarter. Jacobs also had a 14-yard touchdown catch after returning.

The Packers were careful not to overuse Jacobs, who was on a pitch count in Denver. He finished with 73 yards on 12 carries, a season-best 6.1-yard average. After Hufanga’s contact, Jacobs had nine carries for 71 yards.

“I think it helped,” LaFleur said of Jacobs’ limited usage. “Unfortunately, he got hit pretty early in that contest on one of those short-yardage plays, and he just battled through it. He gutted it out. Some of those plays he made were absolutely incredible in terms of the touchdown reception, obviously the 40-yard run, but there were other things in there as well that were pretty remarkable.”

Here are other injury updates LaFleur provided in his news conference:

Packers' Dec. 16 injury report

The Packers held a walk-through practice Dec. 16, so the participation reports are an estimation.

According to the injury report, Josh Jacobs (knee/ankle), MarShawn Lloyd (IR/calf/hamstring), Micah Parsons (knee), Zach Tom (back/knee), Lukas Van Ness (foot), Christian Watson (chest/shoulder), Josh Whyle (concussion), Dontayvion Wicks (ankle) and Evan Williams (knee) did not participate.

Chris Brooks (chest), Darian Kinnard (neck), Collin Oliver (IR/hamstring) and Savion Williams (foot) were listed as limited participants.

Christian Watson injury update

LaFleur did not rule receiver Christian Watson out for the Bears game.

Watson suffered chest and shoulder injuries in the loss to the Broncos and was taken to a Denver area hospital for further tests.

According to LaFleur, the tests were precautionary and did not show anything alarming. Watson flew home with the team and is undergoing treatment this week.

“Thankfully, everything checked out good,” LaFleur said.

The Packers are not practicing Dec. 16. They have a walk-through scheduled and will practice only two days because of the short week leading up to the Saturday night game against the Bears.

Asked if it was just a matter of Watson being able to tolerate pain, LaFleur said other factors will be considered.

“There’s a functioning part of it as well,” LaFleur said. “Certainly, the pain is a big part of it, but functionality, and he’s got to prove that throughout the course of the week.”

Evan Williams injury update

LaFleur said safety Evan Williams, who injured his knee on the same play in which Parsons got hurt, was in the same boat as Watson, Jacobs and some others who will be on the injury report.

Williams will be given all week to see if he can play against the Bears. He was not able to finish the Broncos game after suffering the injury and said afterward he didn’t think it was serious.

Zach Tom injury update

Packers right tackle Zach Tom left in the second quarter against the Denver Broncos after injuring his right knee while pass blocking on Jacobs’ receiving touchdown.

Tom told PackersNews after the game there didn’t appear to be any structural damage.

“We’ll see,” LaFleur said on Tom’s status. “I know he’s going to fight and try to [play], but we’ll just see. We’ll give him the week.”

Josh Whyle injury update

Packers tight end Josh Whyle left the game against the Broncos on the Packers' first drive with a concussion.

Whyle took a big hit from the Broncos’ Talanoa Hufanga while lead blocking on a run play for Jacobs.

MarShawn Lloyd injury update; his season is likely over

Packers running back MarShawn Lloyd suffered another setback on his road to a return when he injured his hamstring last week.

The 2024 third-round pick suffered a groin injury during training camp and briefly returned before injuring his hamstring during the Packers’ August preseason game. He was placed on injured reserve to open the regular season. His 21-day practice window opened Dec. 1. He was initially listed on the injury report with a calf injury, but a hamstring was added on the Dec. 12 injury report when he missed practice.

“Very, very, very unfortunate, because this guy has worked his [expletive] off to kind of battle back,” LaFleur said. “To be in that spot again, what do you say to him? We’ll continue to investigate and try to figure out why this keeps occurring, but it’s certainly unfortunate and I feel bad, I really do. I feel extremely bad for MarShawn.”

While LaFleur didn’t outright say it, he implied Lloyd’s season is over as the Packers have until Dec. 22 to decide if they want to activate him to the roster.

When asked LaFleur said, “I’m not going to say no, but I think you can use deductive reasoning on that one.”","https://www.packersnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/15/STID/87781511007-usatsi-27817070.jpg?crop=4988,2807,x0,y313&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-17 13:02:44.650150

Mahomes/Parsons | Rivers

Playoff predictions | Trade watch

What are you hearing around the league on fallout from Patrick Mahomes' injury?

Graziano: A few people suggested to me that missing the playoffs won't be such a bad thing for the Chiefs, as it will force them to rethink their roster-building strategy around Mahomes. There's a perception that the Chiefs have been kind of perpetually retooling and counting on Mahomes' greatness to cover up their flaws and bail them out when things get dicey. Now, they basically have two extra months to focus on their offseason plans, and they hope to put them to good use.

The Chiefs have devoted resources -- money and draft picks -- to the offensive line. Assuming Josh Simmons comes back healthy and they find a competent replacement for Jawaan Taylor, that group should be a strength in 2026. Tight end Travis Kelce has been on the way out for a while now, and him hanging it up would probably force them to reimagine some things about the offense. The Chiefs need to build a run game, which they didn't do this season.

Mahomes will rehab, and they'll probably go through the 2026 offseason program with some combination of a veteran backup quarterback and a younger developmental one. By the time Mahomes returns, the goal will be to have a roster that doesn't need as many heroics from him as it has the past few seasons.

Fowler: The Chiefs were already forced to look in the mirror well before the Mahomes injury. If anything, his absence will remind Kansas City how much it will miss him -- and how much it needs to strengthen the roster around him. Despite the pedestrian (for his standards) numbers, people I've talked to inside the league did not see Mahomes as the problem for the offense's struggles. The way Mahomes got hurt, grinding for every inch on the field, was an example of just how much he had to manage to simply manufacture first downs this season.

""The fear factor with him is still thick,"" one NFL coordinator who recently prepared for him said. ""He's still the best at winning differently each week. I still fear that player more than most. It just didn't go their way this year.""

I expect the Chiefs' roster to be vastly improved by the time Mahomes returns, which should be some time next season, though Week 1 feels awfully ambitious. He faces a lengthy nine-month recovery from a torn ACL and LCL, a timeline that threatens the early portion of the 2026 season. That he had the surgery so soon after the injury occurred was telling.

What about the aftermath of Micah Parsons' injury?

Graziano: I think people were taking the Packers very seriously as a Super Bowl contender and that the Parsons injury shifts that perception a bit. They are still well-coached, quarterback Jordan Love is playing great, the non-Parsons injuries they suffered Sunday in Denver don't sound like they'll be long term, and there's plenty of talent left on defense. They still could make a run. But Parsons gave Green Bay something a team needs if it's going to string together playoff wins -- a finisher who can get the opposing quarterback on the ground in the game's final minutes and close things.

Things will change for the Packers' defense without Parsons. He elevated other parts of it, and teams will play them differently. They have enough to overcome it and still compete at a high level. But if you're talking about beating, say, the Bears, Rams and Eagles in consecutive weeks on the road in January, that might be a lot to ask without their best player.

Fowler: This injury isn't a referendum on the Cowboys-Packers trade. Parsons was worth every dollar to Green Bay, playing brilliantly before what can be classified as a fluke injury. Parsons' explosiveness could suffer in 2026, when Green Bay will undoubtedly start him on a pitch count, but he's 26 years old, so there's no reason why he won't resume his dominant play.

To your point, the Packers have one issue above all others: How will they close games? Luckily for Green Bay, it has quality pass rush depth with Rashan Gary, Lukas Van Ness, Kingsley Enagbare and others. And the Packers managed a top-six defense last season without Parsons. But he has been deadly in the fourth quarter with game-sealing playmaking. The Packers must get creative with their personnel to offset his loss.

What is the leaguewide buzz on Philip Rivers' first start in five years?

Fowler: The overall feedback was that he was reasonably good, all things considered. ""He played about as well as he could have,"" an NFL offensive coach said. And that's the challenge of playing a 44-year-old off the couch -- ""as well as he could have"" equals 120 passing yards. And he had to strain for that 120. The football wasn't exactly popping out of his right hand.

The Colts were never expecting fireworks from Rivers. But he ran a clean operation against an elite Seahawks defense on the road and seemed to get the Colts in the proper plays. He was ready to dirt the ball when pressure collapsed and made a few timely throws. That's all Colts head coach Shane Steichen can ask at this stage. Driving the ball deep downfield will be a struggle, and I'm curious to see how he responds physically after back-to-back games. Do you have the Colts sneaking into the playoffs with Rivers?

Graziano: I do not, largely because of the way the teams in front of them are playing. The Jaguars and Texans have turned it on in the latter half of the season and look considerably better than the Colts right now. I understand what Indianapolis is trying to do with Rivers, and I'm hearing the same things you are about how pleased the Colts were with his ability to get them in and out of the right looks, change protections and all those things he needs to do to manage a game.

But it does not appear as if he will elevate them, and they're going to need some help to get in -- even if they can run the table. That won't be easy, as they need to beat the 49ers this week and win their head-to-head matchups against the Jags and Texans to finish the regular season.

Fowler: The Colts know that Anthony Richardson Sr. had a prime opportunity taken away by an eye injury. He could have used this past month as a career springboard by potentially guiding Indy into the playoffs. ""It sucks,"" a team source said, citing Richardson's positive training camp while battling Daniel Jones. Maybe Richardson can find his way into the lineup over the final one-two weeks. But Steichen sounds like a coach ready to ride this out with Rivers, for better or worse. The schedule is simply brutal. Indy's last three opponents have a combined 29 wins, putting another losing season on the Colts' radar ... unless Rivers can stop their slide.

Graziano: I guess I wonder what happens if they finish the season under .500 and miss the playoffs again. Are people on the coaching staff and in the front office on the hot seat? Remember, Indianapolis is sort of under new ownership, as the late Jim Irsay's daughters inherited the team following his passing prior to this season. I wonder at what point Carlie Irsay-Gordon will look to make changes.

It's certainly possible the Daniel Jones and Richardson injuries buy people some grace -- everyone knows this Rivers experiment is a Hail Mary and miles removed from their best-case scenario. But the Colts have gone longer without winning the AFC South than any other team in the division, and it doesn't look like that will change this season.

Make your best playoff-related prediction.

Graziano: The Bills will win the AFC. We still don't know yet whether they're going to the playoffs as a wild-card team or as division champs for the sixth year in a row (or at all, technically). But assuming they're there, they would certainly be the most playoff-tested of the likely AFC teams. Quarterback Josh Allen has 13 career postseason starts and seven wins, both of which would be the second highest in the current AFC field behind Aaron Rodgers' 21 and 10, respectively. (This holds even if Rivers drags the Colts into the playoffs, as Rivers has 12 career postseason starts and five wins.)

Lamar Jackson has eight postseason starts and three wins, but right now Baltimore isn't in the field -- and if it gets there, that means Rodgers won't. C.J. Stroud has four playoff starts and two wins, Trevor Lawrence has two and one, while Bo Nix and Justin Herbert have zero wins (Nix has one playoff start, Herbert two). The Bills are aware of the experience difference between them and the rest of the AFC field, and they would point out with no disrespect intended that we don't know how teams such as the Patriots, Jaguars and Broncos are going to do in the playoff pressure cooker. The Bills feel pretty confident they know what it's going to be like -- even if they have to go on the road.

Fowler: Solid argument, Dan. Buffalo's time might be now, even if Allen must will a Super Bowl berth into existence with heroic weekly outputs. Buffalo's supporting cast is good but not great.

Staying with the AFC, give me the Texans for a Super Bowl run. They are 9-2 in their past 11 games. Stroud is back and playing good football. The defense might be the NFL's most feared. Several teams I've talked to after playing Houston have talked at length about that muscle-bruising physical defense. The offensive line has settled down lately. And wide receiver Nico Collins can take over a game. Much will depend on their draw. If the regular season ended right now, the Texans would be in New England in the wild-card round. That's a winnable game.

Also, I'll say Mike Tomlin will get his first playoff win since 2016. The Steelers will win the AFC North and steal a wild-card game at home. They are flawed, but they have an identity built through their running game.

Graziano: In the NFC, I'm going with the Bears to win a game or two, especially if they can beat the Packers on Saturday. That will go a long way toward giving them the NFC North title and at least one home playoff game. When talking to Packers people before Sunday's game in Denver, I came away believing they were extremely impressed with Ben Johnson's bunch, whom the Packers beat in Green Bay the week before, and are certainly not overlooking the importance of this week's rematch.

Chicago's run game is outstanding, with the two-headed attack of D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai. It could give the Bears an edge if they end up in close, low-scoring playoff games in the cold. And while quarterback Caleb Williams is still young and a bit of a wild card, he has come up big in some late-game spots already this season.

Fowler: As far as quick exits, Denver is on my radar despite its impressive push for the No. 1 seed. The AFC feels more open than in years past, and though the Broncos' offense has improved in recent weeks, I still can't shake that midseason lull it had in eking out wins against the Jets and Raiders.

Denver has a dominant defense which can overcome its inconsistent offense. And to his credit, Nix knows how to move an offense downfield. He finds a way, especially late in games. I'm just not sure Denver has enough firepower at the skill positions to keep getting by in January. I might look foolish for this take considering Denver seems to be peaking at the right time.

Who is the most interesting offseason trade candidate?

Fowler: I have several candidates, but let's start with A.J. Brown. The weekly concerns about Brown's messaging -- from sonnets to soundbites -- must be taxing on Philadelphia's locker room, even if players understand the receiver's frustration due to the limitations of the Eagles' passing attack. Several executives I spoke to believe the Eagles could look to move Brown, who's 28 and still has prime years left.

He would undoubtedly have a market. He's due $50 million in cash over the next two years, which is manageable for a WR1. The Eagles would absorb a $20 million cap hit if he's traded before June 1, or they could save $7 million on the cap by waiting until after June 1 to deal him. Either way, the Eagles have shown cap challenges won't deter them (see: the Carson Wentz trade). And it seems that Brown would welcome a new passing game at this point.

Graziano: Mac Jones is under contract with the 49ers for next year at $2.8 million, but the way he played in relief of Brock Purdy this season has people wondering what it would take to trade for him (and presumably pay him more) to come in and compete for a starting role. There are plenty of teams with unsettled 2026 quarterback situations (Colts? Steelers?) which could look to a 27-year-old former first-round pick who has been through the Kyle Shanahan career rehab program as part of their potential solution.

Fowler: The quarterback trade market is worth watching, particularly with supply failing to meet the demand once again. Jones might be the next reclamation project QB to take off in a second act. This leads to a conversation on Kyler Murray, whom the Cardinals are subtly -- or quite obviously -- trying to stash in order to preserve his health for a potential trade this offseason. His nearly $37 million in guarantees on the 2026 books complicates his market, but Murray is 28 and isn't far removed from fringe top-10-QB status.

Does a safe landing spot exist for Murray? Working with, say, Kevin O'Connell in Minnesota would be ideal, but J.J. McCarthy has shown improvement over the past two weeks. The Raiders and Jets are among teams which appear to be in transition at quarterback. Whether a team takes a chance on Murray's maligned career -- and gives up draft capital and financial resources to do it -- remains to be seen.

Another name on my radar is Chiefs corner Trent McDuffie. The last Kansas City corner eyeing a big extension, L'Jarius Sneed, was shipped to Tennessee for a draft pick. McDuffie would have value, and Tampa Bay would be a perfect spot for him.

Graziano: The Chiefs always seem to let cornerbacks go when it's time to pay big money, but a big reason they've been able to get away with that is that they always have a replacement ready to go -- as McDuffie was when they traded Sneed, and like Sneed was when they moved on from Charvarius Ward. I'm not sure they have that heir apparent on the roster, unless they think it's Joshua Williams or Jaylen Watson.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1217%2Fr1590332_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 07:59:13.386609

But quarterback Jalen Hurts did practice after apparently hurting his ankle at the end of the third quarter in the Eagles' 31-0 win over the Las Vegas Raiders on Dec. 14.

""I’m fine,” Hurts said, and thus should be able to play in the Eagles' next game, when they face the Washington Commanders in Landover, Maryland, on Dec. 20 with a chance to clinch the NFC East division title.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

The Eagles held a walk-through practice on Dec. 16, so the injury report was an estimation.

Hurts was injured on the last play of the third quarter when he ran to his right on second-and-4 and lost a yard as he was tackled by ex-Eagles linebacker Devin White. Hurts' leg appeared to bend backward, and he came up hobbling.

That was the final play of the third quarter. Hurts was stretching out his ankle or foot on the sideline during the break between quarters. Hurts stayed in the game. Then on the first play of the fourth quarter, he threw a pass down the middle to A.J. Brown that went for a 27-yard touchdown.

That gave the Eagles a 31-0 lead with 14:54 left. Hurts and most of the offensive starters, including Barkley, came out of the game when the Eagles got the ball back.

Hurts finished 12-for-15 for 175 yards and three touchdowns, with a passer rating of 154.9, just off a perfect score of 158.3.

Hurts' performance came after a turbulent week in which he faced criticism after throwing four interceptions and losing a fumble against the Chargers in the Eagles' 22-19 loss on Dec. 8.

Hurts said he didn't hear that criticism from outside the Eagles' practice facility. Instead, he focused on coming through when the Eagles needed him. Against the Raiders, Hurts helped the Eagles end a three-game losing streak, putting them on the precipice of winning their second straight NFC East crown.

""You work really hard to show up when your team needs you the most,"" Hurts said. ""All of the perceived pressure, whatever that is, is just really preparing for a moment, preparing for an opportunity, and knowing that resilience, determination and perseverance can bring it home for the group.

""I’d say that’s pretty valuable to me, to take pride in showing up when my team needs me to the most.""

Hurts has often shown that so-called ""clutch gene"" in December and January ever since Hurts became a full-time starter in 2021. In those five seasons, Hurts is 18-10, including playoffs, in December through early February.

""I see it as an opportunity,"" Hurts said about those late-season games. ""That’s it. You play in September, October, important games. You’re kind of finding yourself. It’s a new team. You find your groove. But the real things are found in December, January and February.

""And so, I think just being built off perseverance, being built off learning from all of my experiences, and learning from everything, you definitely look forward to that.""

For Hurts and the Eagles, that has included finding more success in the running game. Barkley, who has 940 yards this season, has averaged 86 yards on 4.7 yards per carry over his last three games. That's an improvement over the first 11 games, when Barkley averaged 62 yards per game on 3.7 yards per carry.

Against the Raiders, Barkley (78 yards on 22 carries) had help both from Hurts (39 yards on 7 carries) and Tank Bigsby (57 yards on 17 carries).

In all, the Eagles had 183 yards rushing against Las Vegas. It's the diversified running game, when Hurts can complement Barkley and vice versa, that makes the Eagles most effective.

""I think it’s important to run it regardless,' Hurts said. ""It doesn’t matter who’s running it. It’s just about being able to run it.""

Celebrate the Eagles Super Bowl win with our new book

The Eagles have made adjustments, too. They have lined Hurts up under center more often lately instead of strictly operating out of the shotgun. The Eagles have even passed more out of the under-center formations.

""I think he can be very successful and efficient any way he needs to go and play,"" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. ""Whether that's the gun, whether that's in pistol, whether that's under center, he's shown the fact that the ability to be able to win and be efficient with everything from all different levels.""

That, too, has helped Barkley. It’s not known when Barkley was injured. But he too played through the third quarter against the Raiders, gaining 17 and 11 yards on his last two rushes.

After the game, Barkley said Hurts' running helped him.

""It’s like playing basketball,"" Barkley said. ""You start making some layups, it opens up other parts of the game. I felt like it helped the offense.""

The following were listed as not practicing (an estimation based on the walk-through): DT Jalen Carter (shoulders), G Landon Dickerson (calf), T Fred Johnson (ankle), T Lane Johnson (foot), TE Cameron Latu (stinger).

More notes for Week 16

What are you hearing around the league on fallout fromPatrick Mahomes' injury?

Graziano: A few people suggested to me that missing the playoffs won't be such a bad thing for the Chiefs, as it will force them to rethink their roster-building strategy around Mahomes. There's a perception that the Chiefs have been kind of perpetually retooling and counting on Mahomes' greatness to cover up their flaws and bail them out when things get dicey.

I expect the Chiefs' roster to be vastly improved by the time Mahomes returns, which should be some time next season, though Week 1 feels awfully ambitious.

What about the aftermath of Micah Parsons' injury?

They are still well-coached; quarterback Jordan Love is playing great; the non-Parsons injuries they suffered Sunday in Denver don't sound as ifthey'll be long term; and there's plenty of talent left on defense. They still could make a run. But Parsons gave Green Bay something a team needs if it's going to string together playoff wins -- a finisher who can get the opposing quarterback on the ground in the game's final minutes and close things.

Things will change for the Packers' defense without Parsons. He elevated other parts of it, and teams will play Green Bay differently. The Packers have enough to overcome it and still compete at a high level. But if you're talking about beating, say, the Bears, Rams and Eagles in consecutive weeks on the road in January, that might be a lot to ask without their best player.

Parsons' explosiveness could suffer in 2026, when Green Bay will undoubtedly start him on a pitch count, but he's 26 years old, so there's no reason he won't resume his dominant play.

To your point, the Packers have one issue above all others: How will they close games? Luckily for Green Bay, it has quality pass rush depth with Rashan Gary, Lukas Van Ness, Kingsley Enagbare and others. And the Packers managed a top-six defense last season without Parsons. But he has been deadly in the fourth quarter with game-sealing playmaking. The Packers must get creative with their personnel to offset his loss.

What is the leaguewide buzz on Philip Rivers' first start in five years?

Fowler: The overall feedback was that he was reasonably good, all things considered. ""He played about as well as he could have,"" an NFL offensive coach said. And that's the challenge of playing a 44-year-old off the couch -- ""as well as he could have"" equals 120 passing yards. And he had to strain for that 120. The football wasn't exactly popping out of his right hand.

The Colts were never expecting fireworks from Rivers. But he ran a clean operation against an elite Seahawks defense on the road and seemed to get the Colts in the proper plays. He was ready to dirt the ball when pressure collapsed and made a few timely throws. That's all Colts coach Shane Steichen can ask at this stage. Driving the ball deep downfield will be a struggle, and I'm curious to see how Rivers responds physically after back-to-back games. Do you have the Colts sneaking into the playoffs with Rivers?

Graziano: I do not, largely because of the way the teams in front of them are playing. The Jaguars and Texans have turned it on in the latter half of the season and look considerably better than the Colts right now. I understand what Indianapolis is trying to do with Rivers, and I'm hearing the same things you are about how pleased the Colts were with his ability to get them in and out of the right looks, change protections and all those things he needs to do to manage a game.

But it does not appear as if he will elevate them, and they're going to need some help to get in -- even if they can run the table. That won't be easy, as they need to beat the 49ers this week and win their head-to-head matchups against the Jags and Texans to finish the regular season.

Fowler: The Colts know that Anthony Richardson Sr. had a prime opportunity taken away by an eye injury. He could have used this past month as a career springboard by potentially guiding Indy into the playoffs. ""It sucks,"" a team source said, citing Richardson's positive training camp while battling Daniel Jones. Maybe Richardson can find his way into the lineup over the final week or two. But Steichen sounds like a coach ready to ride this out with Rivers, for better or worse. The schedule is simply brutal. Indy's last three opponents have a combined 29 wins, putting another losing season on the Colts' radar ... unless Rivers can stop their slide.

Graziano: I guess I wonder what happens if they finish the season under .500 and miss the playoffs again. Are people on the coaching staff and in the front office on the hot seat? Remember, Indianapolis is sort of under new ownership, as Jim Irsay's daughters inherited the team following his passing before this season. I wonder at what point Carlie Irsay-Gordon will look to make changes.

It's certainly possible the Daniel Jones and Richardson injuries buy people some grace -- everyone knows this Rivers experiment is a Hail Mary and miles removed from their best-case scenario. But the Colts have gone longer without winning the AFC South than any other team in the division, and it doesn't look like that will change this season.

Make your best playoff-related prediction.

Graziano: The Bills will win the AFC. We still don't know yet whether they're going to the playoffs as a wild-card team or as division champs for the sixth year in a row (or at all, technically). But assuming they're there, they would certainly be the most playoff-tested of the likely AFC teams. Quarterback Josh Allen has 13 career postseason starts and seven wins, both of which would be the second highest in the current AFC field behind Aaron Rodgers' 21 and 10, respectively. (This holds even if Rivers drags the Colts into the playoffs, as Rivers has 12 career postseason starts and five wins.)

Lamar Jackson has eight postseason starts and three wins, but right now Baltimore isn't in the field -- and if it gets there, that means Rodgers won't. C.J. Stroud has four playoff starts and two wins, Trevor Lawrence has two and one, while Bo Nix and Justin Herbert have zero wins (Nix has one playoff start, Herbert two). The Bills are aware of the experience difference between them and the rest of the AFC field, and they would point out with no disrespect intended that we don't know how teams such as the Patriots, Jaguars and Broncos are going to do in the playoff pressure cooker. The Bills feel pretty confident they know what it's going to be like -- even if they have to go on the road.

Fowler: Solid argument, Dan. Buffalo's time might be now, even if Allen must will a Super Bowl berth into existence with heroic weekly outputs. Buffalo's supporting cast is good but not great.

Staying with the AFC, give me the Texans for a Super Bowl run. They are 9-2 in their past 11 games. Stroud is back and playing good football. The defense might be the NFL's most feared. Several teams I've talked to after playing Houston have talked at length about that muscle-bruising physical defense. The offensive line has settled down lately. And wide receiver Nico Collins can take over a game. Much will depend on their draw. If the regular season ended right now, the Texans would be in New England in the wild-card round. That's a winnable game.

Also, I'll say Mike Tomlin will get his first playoff win since 2016. The Steelers will win the AFC North and steal a wild-card game at home. They are flawed, but they have an identity built through their running game.

Graziano: In the NFC, I'm going with the Bears to win a game or two, especially if they can beat the Packers on Saturday. That will go a long way toward giving them the NFC North title and at least one home playoff game. When talking to Packers people before Sunday's game in Denver, I came away believing they were extremely impressed with Ben Johnson's bunch, whom the Packers beat in Green Bay the week before, and are certainly not overlooking the importance of this week's rematch.

Chicago's run game is outstanding, with the two-headed attack of D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai. It could give the Bears an edge if they end up in close, low-scoring playoff games in the cold. And while quarterback Caleb Williams is still young and a bit of a wild card, he has come up big in some late-game spots already this season.

Fowler: As far as quick exits, Denver is on my radar despite its impressive push for the No. 1 seed. The AFC feels more open than in years past, and though the Broncos' offense has improved in recent weeks, I still can't shake that midseason lull it had in eking out wins against the Jets and Raiders.

Denver has a dominant defense which can overcome its inconsistent offense. And to his credit, Nix knows how to move an offense downfield. He finds a way, especially late in games. I'm just not sure Denver has enough firepower at the skill positions to keep getting by in January. I might look foolish for this take considering Denver seems to be peaking at the right time.

Who is the most interesting offseason trade candidate?

Fowler: I have several candidates, but let's start with A.J. Brown. The weekly concerns about Brown's messaging -- from sonnets to soundbites -- must be taxing on Philadelphia's locker room, even if players understand the receiver's frustration due to the limitations of the Eagles' passing attack. Several executives I spoke to believe the Eagles could look to move Brown, who's 28 and still has prime years left.

He would undoubtedly have a market. He's due $50 million in cash over the next two years, which is manageable for a WR1. The Eagles would absorb a $20 million cap hit if he's traded before June 1, or they could save $7 million on the cap by waiting until after June 1 to deal him. Either way, the Eagles have shown cap challenges won't deter them (see: the Carson Wentz trade). And it seems that Brown would welcome a new passing game at this point.

Graziano: Mac Jones is under contract with the 49ers for next year at $2.8 million, but the way he played in relief of Brock Purdy this season has people wondering what it would take to trade for him (and presumably pay him more) to come in and compete for a starting role. There are plenty of teams with unsettled 2026 quarterback situations (Colts? Steelers?) which could look to a 27-year-old former first-round pick who has been through the Kyle Shanahan career rehab program as part of their potential solution.

Fowler: The quarterback trade market is worth watching, particularly with supply failing to meet the demand once again. Jones might be the next reclamation project QB to take off in a second act. This leads to a conversation on Kyler Murray, whom the Cardinals are subtly -- or quite obviously -- trying to stash in order to preserve his health for a potential trade this offseason. His nearly $37 million in guarantees on the 2026 books complicates his market, but Murray is 28 and isn't far removed from fringe top-10-QB status.

Does a safe landing spot exist for Murray? Working with, say, Kevin O'Connell in Minnesota would be ideal, but J.J. McCarthy has shown improvement over the past two weeks. The Raiders and Jets are among teams which appear to be in transition at quarterback. Whether a team takes a chance on Murray's maligned career -- and gives up draft capital and financial resources to do it -- remains to be seen.

Another name on my radar is Chiefs corner Trent McDuffie. The last Kansas City corner eyeing a big extension, L'Jarius Sneed, was shipped to Tennessee for a draft pick. McDuffie would have value, and Tampa Bay would be a perfect spot for him.

Graziano: The Chiefs always seem to let cornerbacks go when it's time to pay big money, but a big reason they've been able to get away with that is that they always have a replacement ready to go -- as McDuffie was when they traded Sneed, and like Sneed was when they moved on from Charvarius Ward. I'm not sure they have that heir apparent on the roster, unless they think it'sJoshua Williamsor Jaylen Watson.

When the rubber hits the road with McDuffie, it'll be interesting to see whether that pattern is a result of how they value the position or if it's more about their confidence in drafting corners and Steve Spagnuolo's ability to develop them. It's also worth noting that Watson, Williams and safety Bryan Cook are all eligible for free agency after this season. The Chiefs have a lot of decisions to make about their secondary.

What else are you hearing this week?

Graziano's notes:

There are a number of theories bouncing around the league regarding Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, who followed up last week's gloomy news conference with a shockingly poor performance by himself and the entire team in Sunday's 24-0 loss to the Ravens. That game eliminated the Bengals from the playoffs, and Burrow continued to seem uncharacteristically despondent afterward. ReceiverJa'Marr Chaseeven said, ""You never know what he might be going through.""

A couple of the people whom I've spoken to about this worry that Burrow could be going down a road similar to former Colts QB Andrew Luck, who retired early because he grew weary of constantly rehabbing injuries. But I also spoke to a couple of people who insist Burrow is obsessively competitive, loves football and is just down about the way this season has gone from a win-loss standpoint.

Regardless, this offseason looms large for Burrow and the Bengals, who are assured of their first losing season since Burrow's 2020 rookie year and will miss the postseason for the third year in a row. There is also speculation around the league about the future of coach Zac Taylor, and the team has major roster questions on the defensive side of the ball, where high draft picks haven't panned out and the switch from Lou Anarumo to Al Golden at defensive coordinator didn't change much. Burrow remains the centerpiece of everything the Bengals do (many seem to believe his relationship with Taylor is one of the reasons Cincinnati might stay the course at coach), and getting/keeping him happy will be at the top of their offseason priority list.

It's important to note that Burrow has never said he's unhappy in Cincinnati and has taken opportunities, even recently, to explicitly state the opposite. But his recent comments about his own happiness and the way he and the team played Sunday in a must-win game aren't helping tamp down the outside speculation that things aren't great between him and the Bengals.

Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel has made a quarterback change late in Tua Tagovailoa's disappointing season. Here's the math on where things stand with Tagovailoa and the Dolphins. He has $54 million in fully guaranteed compensation in 2026. That breaks down as a $39 million salary and a $15 million option bonus that needs to be exercised between the first and third days of the 2026 league year in March. Additionally, on the third day of the 2026 league year, $3 million of his $31 million 2027 salary becomes fully guaranteed. So if he's on Miami's roster as of 4 p.m. ET on March 13, the Dolphins will be on the hook for $57 million guaranteed.

If they were to release him prior to that date, they'd still have to pay him the $54 million in 2026 cash and would absorb $99.2 million in dead salary cap charges. (They could spread that out over two years if they designated him a post-June 1 release, but they'd still take $67.4 million in dead money charges on their 2026 cap and the remaining $31.8 million in 2027.) If they were to find a way to trade Tagovailoa before March 13, the acquiring team would become responsible for the $54 million in 2026 salary and bonuses, and the Dolphins' dead-money charge would drop to $45.2 million. If they traded him after March 13, presumably they'd be on the hook for the $15 million option bonus, while the new team would take the $39 million salary; the Dolphins' dead-money charge would be $60.2 million.

None of this is even close to ideal, obviously, as it would leave Miami in a terrible cap situation and also without a quarterback. TheBroncos took $80 million in dead-money charges (spread over two years) when they released Russell Wilson in 2024, and they managed to make the playoffs last season and currently hold the 1-seed in the AFC playoff field for this season. So huge dead-money charges don't necessarily kill a team's chances. But one of the reasons it has worked for Denver is it found a first-round QB in Bo Nix who could play right away.

Rookie Quinn Ewerscould theoretically be a 2026 starting option if he shows enough in these remaining three weeks. But moving on from Tagovailoa would probably require the Dolphins to be players in that Mac Jones/Kyler Murray/etc. second-chance QB market if they want to compete next year. Not a great spot for whoever their next general manager turns out to be.

Speaking of Nix and those red-hot Broncos, I spoke over the weekend with veteran tight end Evan Engram, who has played with a wide variety of quarterbacks in his time with the Giants, Jaguars and now Broncos. He said the thing that has impressed him about Nix is his desire and ability to quickly fix mistakes. ""You know when you have a gamer,"" Engram told me. ""He's a guy who's going to go out there and make whatever play he needs to make, whether it's with his arm, with his feet, whatever is needed in that moment. He obviously has tremendous confidence. He's had games or moments he's wanted back, but the coolest thing about him is, when he makes a bad play, instantly it's like, 'I'm going to get this fixed.' So he has that confidence and that ability to make plays in the pocket with his arm, and he's also able to correct things in a very quick period of time.""

Coach Sean Payton is keeping the Broncos very much aware of their goals and what's in front of them. He has preached the importance of winning the division and claiming the AFC's top seed, which is why there wasn't a celebration in the postgame locker room on Sunday, even though theirvictory over the Packers clinched Denver a playoff spot. The Broncos still have more they want to accomplish. ""Sean's been very open and real about our goals,"" Engram said. ""So now it's, 'Let's finish. Let's not back in.'""

Payton is trying to become the first head coach in history to win the Super Bowl with two different teams. The Broncos can clinch the 1-seed this weekend with a victory over the Jaguars and losses by the Patriots, Bills and Chargers.

Fowler's notes:

Bucs coach Todd Bowles' profanity-laced tirade Thursday night had been building. In fact, just minutes earlier, Bowles had addressed the team with even more scathe, unleashing in a way that he hadn't all season. He made it known he was going to do the same on the podium. One team source described the postgame scene as Bowles' effort to wake up a team in a slumber.

Losers of five of the past six, the Bucs are pressing on offense and reeling on defense. They are playing third-string offensive guards and the pass rush is poor. Those are not easy fixes at this stage. But from what I'm told, part of Bowles' frustration that spilled over last week is related to the lack of total buy-in on parts of the 53-man roster. That's not a problem with players like Baker Mayfield or Mike Evans, who was so visibly shaken by the last-second loss to Atlanta that he entered the tunnel toward the locker room before Zane Gonzalez's kick went through the uprights. Some of the younger players, however, are still learning how to be pros with an edge and killer instinct and need to shed the ""happy to be here"" mentality. Center Graham Barton said it best: ""We all have to look in the mirror.""

The Bucs still believe they are better than the Panthers. Beating them twice (Weeks 16 and 18) will ensure a fifth consecutive division title. But this is a team that's failing to turn the late-season switch like in previous seasons, and the defensive issues are not easily correctable. At least they are built to win a shootout. The receiving corps might be the league's best pound-for-pound. The team is especially excited about the return of Jalen McMillan, who picked up where he left off in the preseason with two catches for 38 yards. Emeka Egbuka has hit the proverbial rookie wall, so don't be surprised if McMillan's profile grows. On defense, Zyon McCollum was placed on injured reserve, and the Bucs should be getting rookie corner Benjamin Morrison (who has missed the past month) back in time to fill the spot.

In a familiar script, Steelers coach Mike Tomlin shrugged off portrayals of his demise with back-to-back wins. Here's my read on Tomlin's future with the team after making a few calls ... Tomlin's contract runs through 2026 with an option for 2027, as ESPN's Adam Schefter reported. Some of Tomlin's past deals have included an option, which is somewhat common in the NFL. Typically, the team has picked them up. They could do the same this offseason. But one source predicted, ""If they don't, and Tomlin has success in 2026, the team would most likely extend him.""

Otherwise, not much has changed with the dynamics around his future, about which both sides will inevitably discuss at some point in the offseason. I was reminded by multiple people that Tomlin is fiercely loyal to Pittsburgh as a city and organization. I would be at least mildly surprised if he realistically entertained being anywhere else. And the Steelers have redirected the season with wins over the Ravens and Dolphins, forcing a clear path to the playoffs (win in Week 18 over Baltimore, and the Steelers are in).

""There's no panic in the building,"" a source said. ""That's how weeks like [ Week 14 ] pay off. The people there [ including team president Art Rooney II ] aren't on social media. It's business-like there. Mike identifies what the problem is and he digs into the film with his staff to fix it. It's really that simple.""

The pressure is mounting on Pete Carroll in Las Vegas after the team has struggled to stay competitive at 2-12. Here's my sense after asking around Tuesday: The Raiders knew 2025 would be a bit of a slog due to some roster deficiencies, but they hoped they would stay competitive -- at least more so than this season's horrific point differential of minus-167, trailing only the Titans (minus-169). One team source acknowledged, ""It wasn't supposed to be this bad,"" and that something will need to change.

Whether removing Carroll is that change has not been crystallized. But the proverbial hot seat chatter doesn't appear to be going away. As one source with knowledge of the Raiders' operation noted, what the team needs is what it thought it had with Antonio Pierce -- a high-energy first-time head coach with a high ceiling. The Raiders didn't have enough patience to find out whether Pierce (who went 4-13 in his only full season in Vegas, saddled by bad quarterback play) could mature into that. Either way, the Raiders appear to be in danger of a second consecutive one-and-done in the top leadership role.

Ohio State is looking to strengthen its grip on the NFL Rookie of the Year award. Egbuka andPatriots running back TreVeyon Henderson are prime candidates to become the seventh Buckeyes player to earn an offensive or defensive ROY award since 2016. No other school has more than two recipients during that span. Henderson is tilting the odds in his favor after rushing for 490 yards and six touchdowns over the past five games, while Egbuka's production (58 catches, 870 yards, six touchdowns) compares with other top rookie receivers such as Carolina's Tetairoa McMillan (59 catches, 851 yards, six touchdowns). The list of former Buckeyes with the award is impressive: Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud (2023), Jets wide receiver Garrett Wilson (2022),Saints defensive end Chase Young (2020),49ers defensive end Nick Bosa (2019),Commanders cornerback Marshon Lattimore (2017) andBills defensive end Joey Bosa (2016). Penn State and LSU are tied for second with two recipients.

Rams wide receiver Davante Adams is a long shot for Thursday night vs. the Seahawks, but the Rams are not ruling him out, holding out hope. A source considers Adams week-to-week after he reaggravated a hamstring issue. So it's essentially a hamstring pull. Usually players don't come back from that on three days' rest for a Thursday night game, but let's see what the Rams decide here.

Bears receiver Rome Odunze (foot) is considered ""week-to-week right now,"" per a source. While the team is looking at all options with Odunze's nagging foot issue, placing him on injured reserve would be at least a mild surprise. It makes sense to keep his availability open, even if he sits a week. But like with Adams, let's see what the team decides.

Packers safety Evan Williams (knee) could miss multiple weeks after getting injured Sunday against Denver. The injury is not considered severe, and Williams is hoping not to miss any time, but Green Bay, which is notoriously cautious with injuries, is prepared to be without him in the short term. Williams leads the team in interceptions with three.

Ravens corner Chidobe Awuzie, who's having a nice bounce-back season after Tennessee released him, is dealing with a midfoot sprain, I'm told. There's a chance he can make it back by Sundaybut missing at least a week is on the table.

The move makes him the team's third running back to be ruled out for the season. James Conner suffered a season-ending foot injury in Week 3. A week later, Trey Benson suffered a knee injury, which he tried to return from last month but could not. Now, it's Knight's turn to land on injured reserve.

Knight finished his season with 82 carries for 269 yards and four touchdowns. That comes out to just 3.3 yards per attempt, a product of poor run blocking and his own inconsistencies. Knight has averaged 0.6 yards below expectation per attempt, based on Next Gen Stats' player tracking data.

With Knight down, the Cardinals figure to once again turn to Michael Carter to lead their backfield. Carter briefly filled that role earlier in the season, when Benson went down, but was outshone by Knight, who took over.

Like Knight, Carter is averaging 3.3 yards per carry, with 221 yards and a touchdown on 67 attempts. He is averaging 1.1 yards below expectation per attempt, the worst among all NFL running backs with at least 25 attempts.

Carter, though, did perform well against an excellent Houston Texans defense in Week 15. Due to Knight's injury — which occurred on his first snap of the game — Carter played 80% of offensive snaps and rushed 14 times for 56 yards. He also caught four passes for 38 yards.

Emari Demercado, who typically assumes a role on passing downs, played just seven of 66 offensive snaps in his return from a three-week absence with an ankle injury. Even if that number ticks up in Week 16, Carter will likely remain the primary early-down back.

The third running back on the active roster is Corey Kiner, who saw the first five snaps of his NFL career against the Texans.","https://www.azcentral.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/14/PPHX/87764261007-usatsi-27814734.jpg?crop=7694,4329,x0,y552&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-17 12:03:06.783012

Despite fans expressing plenty of frustration in Week 13, the Steelers have won their last two games, and now sit at 8-6 with three weeks to play.

That's quite the turnaround considering fans wanted to fire long-time head coach Mike Tomlin in early December. As for the Miami Dolphins, they may be ready to move on from Tua Tagovailoa sooner rather than later. Head coach Mike McDaniel hinted that they may be ready to make a change before the rest of the season on Tuesday.

With Pittsburgh closing out Week 15 in command of the AFC North, here's are some of the biggest storylines coming out of the week.

Unfortunately for fans, Week 15 was headlined by injuries to star players, comebacks, and clarity on playoff positioning. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes left Sunday's 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers with a torn ACL, and his team was eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in his career. Mahomes already underwent surgery to repair the issue.

On the NFC side, Green Bay Packers trade acquisition Micah Parsons suffered a torn ACL in Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos. Parsons has totaled 12.5 sacks, 12 tackles for loss and a forced fumble in his first season with the Packers.

The Bills and Rams both had second-half comebacks on the road, both of which could have massive playoff implications down the line. The Bills' 21-point comeback gave them a 35-31 win over the Patriots, ending New England’s 10-game winning streak and a 120-game winning streak when leading by 17+ points at home. The Rams cut a 10-point deficit to beat the Lions 41-34.

The playoff chances for the Lions, Panthers and Colts took a huge hit after each suffered tough losses on Sunday. The Lions stumbled in the second half against the Rams in Jared Goff's return to LA, while the Panthers were stunned by the Saints. Forty-four-year-old Philip Rivers' return after a five-year absence was spoiled when a costly interception sealed a win for the Seahawks.

The Rams and Broncos both clinched their spots in the playoffs with their respective wins on Sunday, currently sitting as the No. 1 seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively.

Houston scored on their first four drives on offense against the Arizona Cardinals in Week 15 and built a 23-7 lead by halftime. The Texans eased into the second half for a 40-20 victory, which solidifies them further in the AFC playoff picture.

Quarterback C.J. Stroud is playing well behind an improving offensive line but he can't do it all. Rookie running back Woody Marks has come on strong down the stretch for the Texans' offense.

Marks had at least 50 rushing yards in five of his last seven games ahead of Week 15. He exited the Cardinals game multiple times after a strong first quarter and ultimately ended the game with seven carries for 30 yards and a touchdown on a fumbled snap.

With Marks out, the team relied on Jawhar Jordan to lead the way on the ground. He delivered with 101 yards on 15 carries, the bulk coming on a 50-yard run in the third quarter.

Jordan played well but Marks has been the Texans' top back this season. When will he be back in the lineup? Here's what we know.

Woody Marks injury update

Marks could be back in the lineup for the Texans' Week 16 game against the Las Vegas Raiders at home.

Houston coach DeMeco Ryans says he could've gone back into the game against the Cardinals but was kept on the sidelines as a precaution.

""He got his ankle tweaked a little bit there early in the game,"" Ryans said per KPRC-TV's Aaron Wilson. ""For where he was, felt like Jawhar and Dare [Ogunbowale] were doing a good job, so wanted to keep rolling with those guys and make sure Woody is good as we continue to go into the week.”

Woody Marks stats

The rookie Marks has been the team's top running back this year with Joe Mixon out with injury. Here's a closer look at all of his numbers so far this year:

Carries: 167

Rushing yards: 584

Yards per carry: 3.5

Rushing touchdowns: 2

Targets: 31

Receptions: 21

Receiving yards: 204

Yards per reception: 9.7

Receiving touchdowns: 3

Marks is second on the team in touchdowns from scrimmage with five, behind only Nico Collins, who has seven. Marks has just six starts this season but holds the edge in production over veterans Nick Chubb and Ogunbowale.

Chubb missed Week 15 against Arizona with a rib injury. The Texans haven't released an injury report for Week 16 yet so his status is up in the air ahead of Sunday's game against the Raiders.

Jordan could be next up to backup Marks this week with Ogunbowale providing depth once again.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/17/USAT/87802224007-usatsi-27819335.jpg?crop=4885,2748,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-17 01:18:06.422517

It 's probably not the easiest time to turn the page on the team's 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos on Dec. 14 that included a catastrophic season-ending knee injury to star edge rusher Micah Parsons. But the 212th chapter of the Packers-Chicago Bears rivalry Saturday, Dec. 20 requires immediate focus.

A victory at Soldier Field over the host Bears puts the Packers (9-4-1) back in in first place in NFC North with two games remaining. But if the Packers fail to win the second matchup with the Bears (10-4) in three weeks, Chicago will be in control of the division race.

Despite the fact that many key players other than Parsons also were injured in the Broncos game, the Packers remain a 1½-point favorite against the Bears early in the week.

That may speak to the Packers' recent domination of the series - coach Matt LaFleur is 12-1 against the Bears.

Among them: running backs Josh Jacobs (knee/ankle) and MarShawn Lloyd (calf/hamstring), right tackle Zach Tom (back/knee), defensive end -Lucas Van Ness (foot) and receiver Christian Watson (chest/shoulder).",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6778d28/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7750x4424+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F63%2F90%2F35f66dc441cd86b63be3a127d80e%2F2250610610.jpg,N,,2025-12-17 01:18:33.415960

“No, I’m fine,” Hurts said.

But aside from Hurts, the Eagles released a lengthy injury report as they kicked off a short week ahead of Saturday’s game on the road against the Commanders. The Eagles held a walkthrough on Tuesday, so the report was an estimation:

Did not practice: RB Saquon Barkley (stinger), DT Jalen Carter (shoulders), G Landon Dickerson (calf), T Fred Johnson (ankle), T Lane Johnson (foot), TE Cameron Latu (stinger)

Limited: RB Tank Bigsby (illness)

Full: LB Zack Baun (hand), OLB Jaelan Phillips (knee), T Cameron Williams (shoulder)

It’s worth noting that the Eagles will have their first actual practice of the week on Thursday and it’s possible several of those players listed as “DNP” will be back on the field.

NFL

Barkley on Sunday had 22 carries for 78 yards and a touchdown. He came out of the game briefly in the first half but was able to return and played a total of 39 snaps before the backups took over in the fourth quarter. We’ll obviously be monitoring his status all week.

Lane Johnson has now missed four games with a Lisfranc sprain in his foot. Johnson, 35, suffered the injury against the Lions on Nov. 11 and has missed the three losses to the Cowboys, Bears and Chargers and the win over the Raiders. While Johnson may be nearing a return, he’s still not ready to return to practice.

In Johnson’s place, the Eagles have gotten solid play from backup Fred Johnson, who suffered an ankle injury last week during practice but was able to play.

Jalen Carter has now missed the last two games after having a procedure in both shoulders. The D-line has performed well without him but the Eagles expect Carter back for the playoff run.

Landon Dickerson has been dealing with that calf injury since the Chargers game. He left that game but was able to return and then he started against the Raiders and played 52 snaps before most of the starters were pulled. The Eagles have given Dickerson a day off of practice in each of the last two weeks. The Pro Bowl left guard has played through several injuries in 2025.",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/06/Barkley-S-USATSI-26417520.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-17 04:19:54.286699

Check out fantasy football injury news all season on FantasySP.

Mahomes Out for Season

It's official, is out for the season. He suffered a torn ACL and LCL and will begin rehab in hopes of being ready for the 2026 regular season.

With Mahomes out for the remainder of the season, will take over as the team's starting quarterback. That's obviously a blow to the Chiefs' offense (for the players who play down the stretch).

With the team eliminated, it could be a time to get a look at some younger players on the team, so be mindful of that if you are rostering some of the team's big offensive players ( , and others).

We'll cover start/sit decisions later this week, and we'll see how the Chiefs' fantasy options stack up, so check back for that!

Adams Week-to-Week

is officially week-to-week with his hamstring injury.

That's a big-time blow to the Rams, who play this coming Thursday against the Seahawks. It seems like a longshot to have Adams be available for that contest.

is going to continue to shine, and could somehow be an even better fantasy option with Adams out. Nacua is a must-start fantasy player anyways, but Adams being out means Nacua should really star this week.

I think the player who will benefit the most from Adams being out is tight end . He is coming off a big showing and has a favorable matchup coming against Seattle. That makes Parkinson a desirable waiver wire add, and a player to potentially start in all leagues in week 16.

I think the other big recipient of fantasy value with Adams probably out is running back . He's been trending up already, and with Adams out (and the team being on a short week), it's a perfect time to involve the No. 2 back even more. and Corum have a tough matchup against Seattle, but on volume, I expect both backs to deliver good fantasy scores with Adams missing.

Daniels Done for the Season

won't play again this regular season for the Commanders. That's probably the right choice, as the second-year QB has been injured on and off all season.

will start down the stretch for Washington, just like he has several times already this season. He's not the fantasy QB that Daniels is, but he at least gives the rest of the team's offensive weapons a decent fantasy outlook.

A matchup against the Eagles is tough for Mariota this week, so he's only a deep-league fantasy option. Philly is a slightly above-average matchup for running backs, so has a nice outlook, if he ends up leading the way. missed week 15 with an injury, and got 11 touches behind JCM.

Philly is a tougher fantasy matchup for wideouts, so while and are good fantasy options, they aren't super confident starting options. The Eagles are a brutal test on tight ends, so and are not good fantasy options.

Tuten Out for Several Weeks

is out a few weeks with a finger injury, so the Jaguars will need another back to step up behind . Tuten is expected back for the postseason.

Tuten's injury means Etienne is an even safer starting option in fantasy leagues. He caught three touchdowns last week and went off as a fantasy asset, so he should be starting in most leagues for week 16, even going into a tougher test against the Broncos.

The tough matchup means that (the new No. 2 back with Tuten out) is just a deep-league starting option, and not a very good one. The Colts are a bit more favorable matchup in week 17, but it'd likely take an Etienne injury to give Allen legit fantasy upside in more leagues.

Rivers to Start Again

will start again for the Colts in week 16. That's notable, as has been cleared to return from his orbital injury.

Rivers was 18-of-27 passing for 120 yards, a touchdown and an interception against a tough Seattle defense in week 15. His week 16 matchup against the 49ers is much more favorable, so Rivers will be a better fantasy starting option.

He's still just a deep-league option in my eyes, but he could end up surprising, especially after knocking off the rust last week.

Parsons' Injury Confirmed

is officially out for the season with a torn ACL. That's a gigantic blow to the Packers' defense, and the team's chances to make noise in the NFC.

The takes a hit with Parsons out, but it doesn't mean you should avoid them entirely.

A week 16 clash with the Bears is a rematch of a game from week 14. Green Bay allowed 315 yards and 21 points in that contest. The defense had a sack and interception, but a pretty underwhelming fantasy showing.

Down Parsons, the DST is not looking great for week 16. Green Bay has Baltimore in week 17, so I'd probably only want to start the DST in deeper leagues.

How much of your ranking dropping four spots is a projection of not having Micah Parsons?

And how much of it is, that's just where the Packers are right now.

No, almost completely because of Micah.

I think if they had just lost to the Broncos, and by the way, they were winning that game when Micah Parsons got hurt, And then they give up two touchdowns after Micah's out.

Which makes sense.

Micah's the difference maker in that game.

He is the best player on that team.

He's one of the best players in the NFL.

And now, all of a sudden, you lose that game when you're favored.

And now I don't even know if you're in the division anymore.

They have to go to Chicago Saturday night, like, thats not easy.

So, I just look at the Packers aslook, the Packers in the offseason, They even said, 'We need more urgency.'

We need to start competing for it.

Championships.

So, what did they do?

They went out and got Micah Parsons, 'cause they knew we're a good team that needs to graduate Too great.

Well, we remove Micah Parsons from the equation, They kind of revert back to good.

Uh, they are good; I have nine, like, I, I, I don't think they're a bad team by any means.

I don't think they have championship upside anymore.

It's not just Micah Parsons; it's Tucker Kraft is out for the season.

Devonte Wyatt is out; Elgin Jenkins is out, one of their best offensive linemen.

They seem very short-handed right now.

I think there's just gonna be a ""What If"" season for the Packers.

They're gonna look back and say, man, if we could've stayed healthy, We could have won a Super Bowl.

I really think they had that upside.

But I don't anymore, without Parsons.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/I49vXPN0peUc4QFHA_8U1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/38512240-da9c-11f0-b9ef-10839d1315fd,N,,2025-12-16 22:01:36.010077

Imo, Rome and Gordon see that this is a special season and are/were trying to push through their injuries but they are more severe than we know. Its happened to other teams before. It's just unfortunate.

I think they probably are giving too much credit to players reporting on how they feel, without understanding they are going to say whatever it takes to get on the field for big games.

As Ben said, you gotta protect them from themselves.

Well, when it comes to the Rome/ foot/ fracture thing, I was talking to a few folks in the know about that type of injury, no idea what his situation actually is, but in general, him having issues is not surprising. More issues in the future won't be surprising, so let's just hope for the best, but I wouldn't blame trainers because this type of injury is flukey.

As for the groin thing, I did some research on typical time frames, and if nothing else, both Kyler and Jaylon did their best to get back ahead of schedule, but that answers your question: they didn't give it enough time, so if we're going to blame trainers for anything, I guess the groin situation is what I would point at. So yes, I am worried about Tremaine Edmunds [groin]. I hope the team learned a thing or two.

It's extremely odd to have this happen in consecutive weeks AFTER they have been declared active. I would assume they put them through the appropriate paces before the 90 minute pre-kickoff deadline to make sure they're ok. They shouldn't be doing anything in warmups that they wouldn't do during that assessment.

Without early intervention, brain injuries can evolve into degenerative diseases that rob individuals of their independence, memories, and relationships.

Long-Term Effects of Repeated Concussions

A concussion is a form of traumatic brain injury (TBI). But even hits that don’t cause immediate symptoms, also called subconcussive blows, can be just as dangerous over time. These cumulative impacts can lead to:

Executive dysfunction: Difficulty with planning, reasoning, and decision-making

Impaired speech and motor skills: Trouble communicating or performing daily tasks

Social withdrawal and emotional instability: Resulting from changes in mood, personality, or judgment

Degeneration of brain tissue: Causing irreversible cognitive decline

At Podhurst Orseck, we work closely with medical professionals who can evaluate these effects, document their progression, and connect them to a player’s football career for litigation purposes.

CTE: The Hidden Crisis in Professional Football

Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is perhaps the most notorious consequence of repeated head trauma in contact sports. This progressive and incurable brain disease has been identified in numerous former NFL players. Many of whom died by suicide or experienced profound mental health issues in the years prior to their deaths.

Because CTE can only be confirmed through post-mortem analysis, many families are left without answers during their loved one’s lifetime. However, common signs of CTE include:

Aggressive or violent behavior

Deepening depression and anxiety

Paranoia, confusion, and memory lapses

Increased risk of suicide or self-harm

We advocate fiercely for families who have lost someone to CTE, and for players showing signs of this devastating illness. Through litigation, we help shine a light on the lasting human cost of the NFL’s failure to act.

Do You Have a Case Against the NFL?

The path to compensation can be complicated, especially for those unfamiliar with the terms of the 2015 settlement. But you don’t need to navigate it alone. Podhurst Orseck helps former players, their families, and eligible claimants understand their rights and take appropriate legal action.

You Played in the NFL Before the Settlement Was Approved

If you were retired from the NFL as of July 7, 2014, and meet the eligibility requirements, you may qualify for either a monetary award or medical monitoring benefits. You may still be entitled to coverage or relief even if you’ve never filed a claim.

You’ve Been Diagnosed With a Qualifying Neurological Condition

The NFL settlement outlines specific conditions that qualify for compensation, including:

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

Parkinson’s disease

Alzheimer’s disease

Moderate to advanced dementia

Death with evidence of CTE (diagnosed posthumously)

A confirmed diagnosis paired with qualifying NFL experience could unlock significant compensation, often in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars.

You Experience Ongoing Cognitive or Behavioral Issues

Many former players don’t yet have a formal diagnosis but struggle daily with confusion, personality shifts, and memory loss. Medical monitoring through the settlement can help detect early symptoms and provide access to care that may prevent further deterioration.

Unsure About Your Rights Under the Settlement?

Navigating the NFL concussion settlement isn’t simple. There are deadlines, documentation requirements, and potential disputes over eligibility or evidence. Podhurst Orseck helps clients:

The Eagles held a walkthrough on Tuesday coming off of Sunday's win over the Las Vegas Raiders. If the Eagles held a practice, several offensive starters – especially along the line – would not have practiced.

All-Pro right tackle Lane Johnson has been sidelined since injuring his foot one month ago against the Detroit Lions. He remains out of practice.

His backup, Fred Johnson, landed on the injury report with an ankle injury prior to Sunday's win over the Raiders, but started in the 31-0 win. He would have missed Tuesday's practice due to the injury.

Pro Bowl guard Landon Dickerson would have missed practice with a calf injury that linited him in practice last week.

Running back Saquon Barkley also would not have participated in practice Tuesday due to a stinger that he suffered in the win over the Raiders.

On Monday, the Commanders shut Daniels down for the season with a dislocated elbow that he aggravated during a Week 14 game at Minnesota. Daniels has yet to be cleared to play, and coach Dan Quinn said he was unlikely to be available for Saturday's game vs. Philadelphia.

Their next game was on Dec. 25, and because it would be a shortened week, the team did not feel comfortable playing Daniels even if he were to be cleared.

""I don't want to miss games at all,"" Daniels said. ""It's been a frustrating year, disappointing year. You learn from it and move forward.""

He will remain on the active roster so he'll be able to practice.

""I'm getting better,"" Daniels said. ""I didn't meet the markers to be cleared, so now it's just focused on getting healthy and ready for next year.

""Longevity is a big thing, so you want to be smart with this.""

It was not the follow-up to his successful rookie season that Daniels or anyone wanted. He was named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2024 and was considered an MVP candidate entering this season. But he finished with only 1,262 passing yards, 8 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. He also rushed for 278 yards and two touchdowns.

Daniels said he has dealt with a lot of adversity this season because of the injuries, which limited him to seven games -- only four of which he finished. Daniels dislocated his non-throwing elbow with 7 minutes, 39 seconds left in a game in which Washington trailed Seattle 38-7 when he tried to score from inside the 5-yard line rather than attempt a pass.

He also missed two games with a sprained left knee caused when he was hit by a defender's helmet at the end of a run in Week 2, although Daniels was able to stay in that game. He also missed one game after suffering a hamstring injury in Week 6 at Dallas.

Daniels, when asked whether there were things he could do in the offseason to help avoid those types of injuries, said that, other than the hamstring injury, ""I can't avoid the injuries I've dealt with. Those are freak accidents. You reevaluate after each season.""

Against Minnesota, Daniels was shoved to the ground while pursuing linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel, who had intercepted him. Daniels landed on his left elbow and stayed on the ground for a minute after the play before bouncing up and running to the sideline, clearly frustrated.

After the game, Quinn said Daniels could have returned to the game -- he was never ruled out. But by Wednesday, the coach said that Daniels had aggravated the injury.

Daniels said, ""Adrenaline is a hell of a drug. Things change when stuff settles down.""

He said that they did more tests the day after the game and that ""I felt it.""

Daniels wanted to keep playing but, because he wasn't cleared and because of the shortened week, the decision was made for him to stop.

""This was the right call,"" Quinn said, ""even though it was a difficult one.""

It was yet another blow to a Commanders team that has been decimated by injuries. Washington has had a dozen starters miss at least one game because of an injury, and nine have missed at least seven games.

For Daniels, he'll now focus on doing whatever the team needs in practice -- he said he will at times run the scout team when the team is running Washington's concepts. He'll stay after practice for extra work.

He said he'll pick the brain of some defensive coaches about coverages.

""Be out there, be supportive, and bring the juice and energy,"" Daniels said.

Marcus Mariota, who will start in his place, understands Daniels' situation. He missed a combined 15 games in his first five seasons with Tennessee.

""They're building for the future, and he should feel confident in that they're making a decision that they feel is best for the entire organization,"" Mariota said. ""At the same time, it's tough as an athlete. You want to be out there. We all understand that.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1216%2Fr1590278_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 19:59:41.627465

With Pittsburgh closing out Week 15 in command of the AFC North, here's are some of the biggest storylines coming out of the week.

Unfortunately for fans, Week 15 was headlined by injuries to star players, comebacks, and clarity on playoff positioning. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes left Sunday's 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers with a torn ACL, and his team was eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in his career. Mahomes already underwent surgery to repair the issue.

On the NFC side, Green Bay Packers trade acquisition Micah Parsons suffered a torn ACL in Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos. Parsons has totaled 12.5 sacks, 12 tackles for loss and a forced fumble in his first season with the Packers.

The Bills and Rams both had second-half comebacks on the road, both of which could have massive playoff implications down the line. The Bills' 21-point comeback gave them a 35-31 win over the Patriots, ending New England’s 10-game winning streak and a 120-game winning streak when leading by 17+ points at home. The Rams cut a 10-point deficit to beat the Lions 41-34.

The playoff chances for the Lions, Panthers and Colts took a huge hit after each suffered tough losses on Sunday. The Lions stumbled in the second half against the Rams in Jared Goff's return to LA, while the Panthers were stunned by the Saints. Forty-four-year-old Philip Rivers' return after a five-year absence was spoiled when a costly interception sealed a win for the Seahawks.

The Rams and Broncos both clinched their spots in the playoffs with their respective wins on Sunday, currently sitting as the No. 1 seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively.

Fans already knew the Chiefs were on the brink of being eliminated from playoff contention, yet, an injury to the franchise icon was even more concerning.

Unfortunately, Mahomes’ greatest fears came true, with the three-time Super Bowl champion suffering a torn ACL and LCL. The usual timetable for recovery can be anywhere from 8 to 12 months, depending on various factors. Being out for 12 months would essentially knock Mahomes out for the entirety of the 2026 season. Yet, that apparently won’t be the case with Mahomes.

According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, “it will be a surprise” if Mahomes isn’t back in action in time for the start of the 2026 NFL season.

That would be great news for the Chiefs, who may not have to embark on a major journey to find a one-year stopgap starter, only to turn to Mahomes as soon as he’s fully cleared for football activity.

It helps that Mahomes didn’t lollygag after getting hurt. Many athletes need to wait days or even weeks for swelling to go down before being able to go under the knife. That wasn’t the case for Mahomes, who was able to have surgery less than 24 hours after the injury occurred.

Plus, with Mahomes’ work ethic, he’ll surely attack his rehab and recovery process just as he’d approach gameplanning for his opponent on a weekly basis. That too could help shorten his injury recovery timeline, helping the Chiefs return as potential contenders in 2026. Yet, they could still bring in another quarterback for insurance purposes this offseason.

Has a problem emerged for the Seahawks’ offense?

Head coach Mike Macdonald said during his weekly Monday afternoon press conference that Cross is dealing with a hamstring injury suffered late in Sunday’s 18-16 win over the Indiapolis Colts.

“It’s a hamstring. We’re just trying to gather the info right now, exhausting all options to see how fast we can get him back,” Macdonald said.

The Seahawks are in a tough spot if they’re hoping that Cross can be healthy enough to start in their next game, because they have a short week before a monumental Thursday Night Football meeting with the Los Angeles Rams. The Seahawks and Rams are both 11-3 and tied for the lead in both the NFC West and the NFC as a whole.

Cross was helped off of the field after his legs split awkwardly while he was blocking on the Seahawks’ game-winning field goal by kicker Jason Myers against the Colts.

A first-round NFL Draft pick out of Mississippi State in 2022, Cross has played 62 (all starts) of the 65 regular season Seahawks games over the past four years. Retaining him will be a key priority for the Seahawks as he is set to be a free agent after this season.

More Seahawks injury updates

• There’s good news at the other tackle spot for the Seahawks. Macdonald said there is no concern about the status of right tackle Abraham Lucas, who missed time in the first half of Sunday’s game with a shoulder injury.

“Abe is all good to my knowledge,” Macdonald said.

• Rookie wide receiver Tory Horton has “hurdles” to clear if he’s going to return this season, Macdonald said.

“We’ll see about Tory. He’s taking it as he improves right now. He’s got some hurdles we’ll wait to see him get over those hurdles. But if he gets over them, then we can get him back.”

Horton was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 22 with a shin injury. He has already missed four games, which is the required minimum amount before a player is eligible to return from IR.

A fifth-round pick out of Colorado State, Horton has 161 yards and five touchdowns on 13 catches in eight games this season. He also has served as a punt returner for Seattle.

The Seahawks take on the Rams at Lumen Field at 5:15 p.m. Thursday, with Seattle Sports radio coverage beginning at 2 p.m. with the pregame show.

Dr. Dan Cooper, an orthopedic surgeon based in Dallas, performed the surgery. Cooper specializes in knee and shoulder injuries for the Carrell Clinic, based in Texas.

Chiefs head coach Andy Reid said earlier Dec. 15 that Mahomes was seeking a second opinion in the Dallas area. The Chiefs said Mahomes will begin his rehab immediately. The three-time Super Bowl winner will have roughly nine months to prepare for Week 1 of the 2026 season.

ESPN reported that Cooper also repaired Mahomes' torn lateral collateral ligament (LCL).

Mahomes suffered the injury on Dec. 14 as the Chiefs lost to the Los Angeles Chargers at home, which knocked them out of playoff contention. The two-time MVP was tackled from behind by Chargers defensive end Da'Shawn Hand. Mahomes immediately reached for his left knee after being rolled up from behind as Kansas City's medical staff immediately tended to him.

He eventually walked off under his own power but Chiefs head coach Andy Reid told reporters that the initial prognosis did not ""look good.""

Patrick Mahomes - ACL/LCL

Mahomes hyperextended his knee and tore his ACL/LCL. On Monday (Dec. 15), he had the knee reconstructed. Given reports from Adam Schefter, the almost immediate surgery and the Chiefs' 2026 odds being in the tank without him, Mahomes pushing to return early in the season makes sense.

But is it possible?

Here are a few modern examples:

Joe Burrow returned in 9 months and 1 week after every ligament in his knee exploded. Similarly, Robert Griffin III returned in 8 months despite LCL involvement. However, in 2023, the Cardinals slow-played Kyler Murray, who took 10 months to return from the date of his surgery.

The elephant in the room, though, is that Mahomes’ rehab has to go smoothly without any hiccups. That is a huge assumption and not a guarantee for any athlete's rehab. But we can hold our breath and watch reports out of KC.

What can we expect once he’s back?

In the modern era, big studies like this one have concluded QB play largely does not take a hit after an ACL tear. However, zooming into fantasy-relevant QBs paints a slightly different picture. It’s important to note that this is a small sample and may not reflect overall returns. However, it’s a decent place to start.

When excluding Deshaun Watson, the average decrease in QB rushing attempts per game is about 19%. That resulted in an average decrease in fantasy points per game of about 14% overall.

QBRush Attempts per Game DifferentialDonovan McNabb113%Robert Griffin III83%Deshaun Watson122%Carson Wentz61%Joe Burrow68%Kyler Murray103%

Projected Return: Week 1-4, 2026

Davante Adams - Hamstring

This is the aggravation that’s almost expected in a WR his age. He won’t play Week 16, but Week 17 is on the board.

Projected Return: Week 17-18

Christian Watson - Chest

After going to the hospital for a CT, an SC joint injury makes sense. This injury caused Jalen Hurts to miss 2 games in 2023. I would expect something similar for Watson.

Projected Return: Week 17-18

We mentioned he would be volatile this week, and the re-aggravation hit in pre-game. At this rate it’s hard to know when Odunze will be back. Don’t count on him.

Projected Return: TBD

Luther Burden - Ankle

Burden was ruled out and the Bears have called him day-to-day. If he doesn’t practice this week, he won’t go.

Projected Return: TBD

Bam Knight - Ankle

Knight will be out for the foreseeable future with an ankle sprain.

Projected Return: TBD

Marks once again tweaked the foot/ankle. He would have returned if needed, according to the Texans. He’ll play next week, but remains highly volatile.

Tunsil later admitted that yes, he wants to be paid, but he hopes it's in Washington after the Commanders traded for him last offseason. With two years remaining on his contract, Tunsil is due a nice raise after his outstanding debut season in Washington.

Tunsil has started every game for the Commanders this season, but that could be in jeopardy on Saturday against the Philadelphia Eagles. Tunsil left Sunday's Week 15 win over the New York Giants in the first half with what was reported as a shoulder injury. Trainers worked with Tunsil on the sideline, but he went into the locker room.

Tunsil did return to the game, only to leave again, when Washington reported his injury as an oblique. Overall, Tunsil played 29 of the Commanders' 61 offensive snaps.

On Monday, head coach Dan Quinn offered an update on Tunsil.

""He has an oblique injury, and we'll have to see what the strength looks like for him, the movement, the strength over the next couple days,"" Quinn said. ""And if he's able to, then he will play.""

Remember, Washington plays on Saturday — not Sunday. That one day could make a big difference in Tunsil's availability this week. The Commanders have nothing to play for with three games remaining, and ended quarterback Jayden Daniels' season on Monday.

If Tunsil can't go, Washington has Brandon Coleman. As a rookie last season, Coleman started 15 total games at left tackle, including the playoffs. He started all three games against the Eagles.","https://commanderswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/06/11/SCMD/84141533007-usatsi-26416832.jpg?crop=2947,1658,x0,y0&width=2947&height=1658&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-16 17:01:24.136989

On a recent episode of the “Let’s Go!” podcast with Jim Gray, Brady talked about the rehab process and its mental challenges.
When asked about what advice Brady would give Mahomes on the process, Brady was adamant that the key is to stay focused on what’s ahead.
Instead of training mode, they’re in rehab mode,” he said.
“I think you’ve got to get through rehab mode as fast as possible, and then you get back to training mode.","If anyone can relate to Patrick Mahomes and knows something about winning multiple Super Bowls early in his career and then tearing an ACL in his ninth season, it’s Tom Brady.

Rehabbing from a major knee injury is a long, strenuous process that’s as taxing on the mind as it is on the body. On a recent episode of the “Let’s Go!” podcast with Jim Gray, Brady talked about the rehab process and its mental challenges.

It’s a process Mahomes is set to embark on after tearing his left ACL late in Sunday’s 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, which eliminated the Chiefs from playoff contention for the first time in his career.

“It’s a tough rehab,” Brady said. “It’s one of the toughest rehabs. I just remember every day pushing myself. And it’s always the same amount of pain and discomfort, except you’re making progress through that pain and discomfort, which is a hard psychological thing to battle. You feel like, ‘God, every day it doesn’t feel right.’ Except you’re gaining range of motion and you’re gaining strength, and you are on the road to recovery. So, I wish him the very best.”

Brady tore his left ACL in the first game of the 2008 season, following a Super Bowl XLII loss the previous February.

When asked about what advice Brady would give Mahomes on the process, Brady was adamant that the key is to stay focused on what’s ahead.

“The only thing you can do is focus on what’s ahead of you and not look back,” Brady said. “And just say, ‘OK, this is part of what my career is going to be, and a lot of people have gone through it, and a lot of people have overcome it.’ You’ve just got to put as much diligence into the rehab process. And I always feel like the faster you rehab, the faster you can get back to practicing the sport that you love.”

Brady also noted there is no room for self-pity or sorrow. The seven-time Super Bowl winner returned from his ACL injury in Week 1 of 2009 and won the NFL’s Comeback Player of the Year award that season.

“I think sometimes people will pace themselves. Instead of training mode, they’re in rehab mode,” he said. “I think you’ve got to get through rehab mode as fast as possible, and then you get back to training mode. But that requires an all-out commitment, and it’s the same commitment that the great professional athletes make to be great at their profession. When you go through the rehab process, you need that same level of focus and determination.”

Mahomes isn’t the only starting quarterback of his generation to tear an ACL.

Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow tore his ACL in November of his rookie year in 2020. The following season, he returned to play Week 1 and led the Bengals to the Super Bowl, where they lost to the Rams.

Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray tore his ACL in December 2022. He returned to game action in November 2023 and finished the season 3-5.

Mahomes, 30, shared on social media Monday that he’s ready to attack the process.

“Don’t know why this had to happen,” Mahomes wrote. “And not going to lie, it hurts. But all we can do now is trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you, Chiefs Kingdom, for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/02/05154822/USATSI_24601696-scaled-e1765906480278.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-16 16:03:50.316865

The surgery was performed by Dr. Dan Cooper, the Dallas Cowboys' head team physician. A league source told ESPN that Dr. Cooper also repaired the torn LCL in Mahomes' left knee, confirming a report by NFL Network.

According to the Chiefs, Mahomes ""will begin his rehab process immediately.""

Mahomes was injured with less than two minutes remaining in Sunday's 16-13 loss to the Chargers, a result that ended the Chiefs' playoff hopes.

The typical recovery for such an injury is about nine months, meaning Mahomes will miss the team's offseason program, and his availability for the start of next season is in question. The 2026 NFL season opener is Sept. 10.

""He'll attack it, just like he does everything else,"" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said earlier Monday when addressing Mahomes' rehab. ""There have been some pretty good quarterbacks who have had the same injury, and they've done pretty well after they came back. He'll get after it, and he's got good people here to rehab him. He'll be right on top of all of that.""

One of the most prominent quarterbacks to rehab a torn ACL is Tom Brady, who was injured in the 2008 opener when he was 31 and in his ninth NFL season.

During Monday's episode of his ""Let's Go!"" podcast, Brady shared some advice for Mahomes based on his own experience.

""You've just got to put as much diligence into the rehab process,"" said Brady, who went on to win four Super Bowls after his injury. ""I always feel like the faster you rehab, the faster you can get back to practicing the sport that you know you love. I think sometimes people will pace themselves. Instead of training mode, they're in rehab mode. I think you got to get through rehab mode as fast as possible, and then you get back to training mode.

""Micah Parsons is hurt because of Bo Nix,"" Clark said.
You could see that Micah Parsons was the one person in pursuit of Bo Nix the entire day.
That was part of what he'd seen the entire night, and the way Bo Nix was able to attack that defense -- Bo Nix was amazing last night.","The Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers were locked in a tight game in the waning moments of the third quarter. On a first down play, quarterback Bo Nix began to move the pocket, towards the near side of the field, before finding himself face-to-face with All-Pro Micah Parsons. Nix immediately stopped on a dime, causing Parsons to quickly change direction and land awkwardly. It was later revealed Parsons tore his ACL on the play, ending his season early.

Parsons was the second high-profile player of the day to injure the ligament, joining Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes.

Leading up to Monday Night Football, ESPN talked about the injury to Parsons and the great game Nix had against a high-level Packers defense. Former Super Bowl champion and current analyst Ryan Clark said Nix's elusiveness was the cause of Parsons' injury.

""Micah Parsons is hurt because of Bo Nix,"" Clark said. ""And I'm not saying that it's one of those things that's Bo Nix's fault, but the violence in which Micah Parsons had to chase Bo Nix the entire second half was extremely evident. Whether it was the touchdown to [Michael] Bandy, the throw to Troy Franklin. Getting outside the pocket and finding Lil'Jordan Humphrey. You could see that Micah Parsons was the one person in pursuit of Bo Nix the entire day.

""And on the injury and on the play he [Parsons] was hurt, Bo Nix attempted to get outside, he found [Marvin] Mims, and you could see Micah redirect in order to keep him in the pocket. That was part of what he'd seen the entire night, and the way Bo Nix was able to attack that defense -- Bo Nix was amazing last night. And it's sad you lose a great player like Micah Parsons, but it was because of the effort that he to give in order to get to Denver's quarterback.""

Reid also said that Mahomes is heading to Dallas to get a second opinion on his knee from Dr. Daniel Cooper, the Dallas Cowboys' head team physician. Mahomes is expected to have surgery later this week.

""He'll attack it, just like he does everything else,"" Reid said of Mahomes' upcoming rehab. ""There have been some pretty good quarterbacks who have had the same injury, and they've done pretty well after they came back. He'll get after it, and he's got good people here to rehab him. He'll be right on top of all of that.

""As long as the surgery goes well, as expected, then I would expect a fairly quick recovery for him, just because of those factors.""

Mahomes sustained his injury with less than two minutes remaining in Sunday's 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, a result that ended the Chiefs' playoff hopes.

In an effort to rally the Chiefs, he scrambled out of the pocket, rolling to his right while he was chased down by defensive end Da'Shawn Hand. Once Mahomes planted his left foot and threw the ball away for an incompletion, his left knee buckled. After he fell to the turf, Mahomes immediately grabbed his left knee and winced in pain.

""Don't know why this had to happen,"" Mahomes wrote on social media. ""And not going to lie, [it] hurts. But all we can do now is [trust] in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you, Chiefs kingdom, for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I [will] be back stronger than ever.""

Following his surgery, Mahomes will miss the team's offseason program, and his availability for the start of next season is in question.

Mahomes, 30, had managed to stay free of long-term injuries during his NFL career. In 2019, while executing a quarterback sneak, he dislocated his right kneecap but missed just two games -- the longest absence of his career -- and later that season led the Chiefs to their first Super Bowl victory in 50 years. In the 2020 playoffs, Mahomes returned from a concussion and played through turf toe in his left foot, an injury that required surgery that offseason. And his most heroic moment playing through pain was in the 2022 postseason, when he led the Chiefs to another Super Bowl victory while dealing with a high right ankle sprain.

""I've had a good visit with him a couple different times,"" Reid said of Mahomes' reaction and attitude. ""He's in a good place. He feels like he let people down. He's ready for the challenge ahead. He's just got to get through surgery, wherever it might be. I know he'll come out on the strong end of this.""

In the offseason, the Chiefs' priority list will now have to include quarterback. The team doesn't have another quarterback under contract for the 2026 season.

Backup quarterback Gardner Minshew, a five-year veteran, is expected to be the team's starter for the final three games of the regular season. That stretch will serve as an audition for Minshew to remain with the Chiefs for next season.

""I've got a ton of confidence in Gardner,"" Reid said. ""I've watched him play with other teams, he's started in the league, and our guys have confidence in him.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1215%2Fr1589653_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 14:01:49.948311

However, while a collapsed lung can be serious, depending on the cause, some cases are not as severe.

If Warren can't play, Kenneth Gainwell and rookie Kaleb Johnson would handle the running back duties for Pittsburgh. However, Warren leads the team in rushing yards (652) and attempts (159) and is tied with Gainwell for the team lead in rushing touchdowns (four).

The Steelers received good news this weekend when tight end Darnell Washington was cleared to play after suffering a concussion in Week 14 against the Ravens. However, starting defensive tackle Derrick Harmon is also questionable after missing the past two games with a knee injury.

""My comments had nothing to do with Cincinnati,"" Burrow said via the team’s website. ""My comments had everything to do with being my mindset and football.""

""A lot of confidence,"" Burrow said. ""I know how hard people work at it. We got the right people. It starts with players playing better. Today it was me.

Burrow missed nine games after suffering a toe injury in Week 2 that required surgery, and the Bengals were 1-8 without him. Theynow enter Week 16 ranked last in the NFL in total defense. That speaks to how dependent the Bengals are on Burrow, but he doesn't believe he's carrying too large a load.

Michael Strahan and Watt share the single-season sack record with 22.5. Garrett recorded 1.5 sacks in Cleveland's 31-3 loss to the Chicago Bears and suffered a hip injury in the process. However, Garrett remained in the game and said afterward that he won't miss any time.

""I'm going to play through pretty much anything,"" Garrett said, via Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com. ""Tweaked my hip or something in that area, so I was feeling that for the rest of the game. But like I said, we're just going to keep continuing to push through because we've still got something to play for. As long as there's games on the schedule, I'm going to go out there and try to win.""

""Brian Eayrs did a phenomenal job managing it and he was really decisive, and I gave him a lot of the credit.
He got a game ball in the locker room because he really put us in position to go still have a chance to win the game.""
And after Sunday's win, Macdonald presented Eayrs with a game ball during the postgame celebration to recognize his contributions to the win.
And he's just done a great job.""","As the Colts drove for what ended up being a go-ahead field goal in the final minutes on Sunday, the Seahawks had a decision to make on how to handle the clock. Use timeouts to stop the clock despite having a one-point lead, or burn them to make sure they would have some time back even if the Colts scored. Ultimately, Macdonald, with input from director of football analysis and special situations Brian Eayrs, decided to use all three timeouts. That decision paid off, because after the Colts kicked a 60-yard go-ahead field goal, the Seahawks still had 47 seconds left on the clock, which was enough time for Sam Darnold and company to get in range for the game-winning kick.

""It's kind of a function of like, 'Hey, as this kind of declares as the last possession, even though they still had three timeouts, you're trying to figure out a way if it doesn't go your way you have a chance to come back and win it,' Macdonald said after the game. ""Brian Eayrs did a phenomenal job managing it and he was really decisive, and I gave him a lot of the credit. He got a game ball in the locker room because he really put us in position to go still have a chance to win the game.""

Eayrs, who was hired by Pete Carroll in 2013, was one of many people on the football support staff that Macdonald kept when he was hired last year, and Eayrs' role has evolved under Seattle's new coach in a way that makes him a key part of Macdonald's decision-making process on gameday. And after Sunday's win, Macdonald presented Eayrs with a game ball during the postgame celebration to recognize his contributions to the win.

""He came very highly recommended by John (Schneider) and everybody else in the building,"" Macdonald said Monday. ""That obviously carries a lot of weight as you get to know him. Just like what I said to the team yesterday, talking about chasing edges, it's just really that mentality that you have to have in that position. It was just clear really early that this was his mentality about how he wanted to approach these things. It's a job that he has initially had like the full scope of that responsibility before, and he's just really attacked it. From my perspective, when you try to give people responsibility, that's what I'm looking for. It's what's the attitude like? Are we really just diving deep and trying to make it come to life the best we can to help the team in any aspect? You name the job, that's what we're looking for. Brian's (Eayrs) been a great example of how to attack it, make it his own, and add his personality to it and his own flavor. And he's just done a great job.""

""That was great. Another great play, that's really indicative of his growth,"" Macdonald said. ""(The Week 13 tackle of Jefferson) wasn't quite cost of doing business. He could have definitely made a smarter decision in that moment. But when you're going to live on the edge like that, I don't think it was a selfish decision or that he was trying to hurt him. He's on the edge and that's how we want to play on defense. Sometimes you have to learn how to handle that when you want to play right there. That was a great example of how we want to play.

And yet, NFL owners want more.
Players — desperate to hold onto what they have — will relent, unwittingly giving the NFL an 18th game basically for free.","As Patrick Mahomes and Micah Parsons hobbled to their respective locker rooms Sunday evening, moments after each tumbled to the turf and writhed in pain while trainers and team doctors rushed to their aid, a sickening feeling settled over all who watched.

Two of pro football’s brightest stars, we soon learned, each tore an ACL in an otherwise spectacular day of late-season football. Now, Mahomes and Parsons face surgeries, long recovery roads and uncertainty over when/if they will regain their elite forms. The three-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback and the 2021 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year joined hundreds of their football brethren who have landed on injured reserve this season. (According to NFLPA figures, 309 players have been placed on IR through 15 weeks of regular-season action, which is slightly down from 319 through 15 weeks in 2024, but up compared to 274 through this point in 2023.)

The Green Bay Packers’ Super Bowl dreams took a major hit. Also in jeopardy: the Kansas City Chiefs’ chances of quickly rebounding next season from a disappointing 2025.

The football gods are cruel. Or, are they trying to tell us something?

Just last week, the NFL announced a $32 million investment to launch professional women’s and men’s professional flag football leagues in conjunction with the anticipated wave of excitement stemming from the sport’s debut in the 2028 Olympic Games. Also, last week, the NFL announced that it will host games in Munich, Germany, next season and in 2028. The push to globalize America’s most popular sports league remains in full force. NFL officials and team owners envision a day when games rival the Premier League in popularity.

The driving force behind that goal: continue driving the annual revenue of this cash cow to $25 billion and beyond.

Another leg of those revenue-generating plans involves the eventual expansion from 17 regular-season games to 18. Few fans would argue against such a move. The appetite for football is voracious. However, the sight of Mahomes and Parsons sidelined by injury offered a painful reminder that the altar always demands a sacrifice, and eventually, even the game’s brightest and best fall prey.

The adage, “Injuries are part of the game,” is true. Yet, with each torn knee ligament (entering Week 15, 59 players were on IR with such injuries) and popped Achilles tendon (11 seasons have ended in such fashion), it grows harder to grasp the prudence of further expansion of the regular-season schedule.

More football is great, but at what cost? Will the unquenchable thirst for more — more money, more games — eventually take its toll and lead to the shortening of careers and the deterioration of the game?

The NFL has invested in many technological advances to ensure that players use the top-of-the-line equipment. The league hopes that rigorous testing will soon ensure games take place on only the highest quality of playing surfaces (whether natural or synthetic). Officials implement rule changes every couple of years and declare the game safer than ever. Injuries remain inevitable, however, even in this modern age where athletes are bigger, faster and stronger than ever.

Changes to the offseason program, training camp, preseason workload and regular-season preparation process may have alleviated some of the pounding those bodies sustain leading up to game days. However, year-round training, which seems like necessary preventative maintenance, replaces some of the wear and tear. And don’t forget that ever-expanding college football seasons mean some athletes come into the NFL with more mileage on them than ever. So, is it any wonder that even the most diligent and dedicated players struggle to make it through a season unscathed?

It’s still too early to know what kind of long-term impact 17 regular-season games, an expanded postseason and shortened offseason is having on athlete bodies (feels like we know, but the answers aren’t concrete); however, the last thing that any pro football player needs is another 50-plus plays worth of collisions before postseason action even begins.

And yet, NFL owners want more.

The NFL has long operated with a “next man up” attitude. If a man goes down, scrape him up, plug another in and the show goes on. It’s what happened when Mahomes, Parsons, Malik Nabers, Nick Bosa, Fred Warner, Tyreek Hill, Michael Penix Jr., Daniel Jones, Najee Harris and others went down with season-ending injuries at various points this season. Indeed, the show will go on. Yet how appealing is a league whose stars only last a portion of the season and second-rate/mistake-prone backups fill their roles?

It’s impossible to predict when the injury bug will strike. Any of those players had the same chance of getting hurt in Week 1 as they did in Week 15. However, players feel it is unwise to heighten the risk of injury by expanding their workload with a longer regular-season schedule. Sure, you can trim the preseason further, but most veterans don’t play in those contests anymore anyway. You can implement a second bye week, but the pounding will still pile up.

Fortunately for the players, true negotiations towards such an expansion have yet to take place. The controversy-laden resignations of NFLPA executive director Lloyd Howell and chief strategy officer J.C. Tretter have caused a leadership void, and the ongoing search for replacements has bought them some time. Yet, expansion talks are coming — likely this offseason after the players union elects its next full-time executive director — well before the expiration of the current CBA, which runs through 2030.

If NFL team owners are smart, care about the quality of the game and the investments that make the league go (the players), they would abandon thoughts of an 18th game. Yet, we all know where their priorities lie. That’s why the players — once they finally get their leadership structure figured out — should resist at all costs.

You’re talking about a war, but the best move from the player camp would involve coming to that future negotiation table with the stance of “We want to go back to 16 games, and we want the same economic structure that we have now.” Owners would have a coronary. Even so, with players now coming out of college with the security of NIL money and the added asset of their multi-billion dollar company, OneTeam Partners, players would be better equipped for a lockout.

That will never happen, though. It was hard enough for NFLPA leaders to get the player body on the same page for the last two CBA negotiations. Such a bold move — although effective — would scare too many players.

And so, owners will again have the upper hand. They already hate the revenue split they agreed to in the last CBA and how much they’re spending in terms of salary cap and player benefits. So it’s expected that the owners would attempt to keep the current economic structure in place as long as they get an 18th game and recoup some of that. Players — desperate to hold onto what they have — will relent, unwittingly giving the NFL an 18th game basically for free.

Except it doesn’t have to be that way. The NFL doesn’t need an 18th game to grow the pie. Operating according to the current playbook of gradually expanding the international slate, and continually auctioning prime games to streaming services (We all grumble about the latter, but keep forking over the bucks), league revenue will still increase by roughly $1 billion a year.

Opting for quality over quantity would best serve everyone. The players avoid the increased risk of injury and shortened playing careers, and the owners receive a stronger product to dole out to the world.

Injuries are indeed an unfortunate part of the game, but unnecessarily embracing heightened risk defies logic.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/15173118/GettyImages-2251448004-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-16 13:02:35.414163

Given the anticipated recovery time, it's still unclear exactly when Mahomes will make his return next season.","The Kansas City Chiefs' Week 15 game against the Los Angeles Chargers went about as poorly as anyone could have imagined — and then some.

The game was already a must-win for the Chiefs, who were on the brink of missing the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. Not only did the Chiefs end up losing the game 16-13, thus eliminating them from the postseason and effectively ending their season, but superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes also suffered a season-ending injury.

How did Patrick Mahomes get hurt?

Mahomes went down in the final minutes of the Chiefs-Chargers game after being tackled from behind by Chargers defensive end Da'Shawn Hand. The veteran quarterback immediately reached for his left knee after the hit and remained down as he received treatment from the team's medical staff. He was eventually helped off the field and did not return for the remainder of the game.

The Chiefs announced on social media later in the day that Mahomes sustained a torn ACL in his left knee, and that they're ""currently exploring surgical options.""

What is an ACL?

The ACL is the common abbreviation for the ""anterior cruciate ligament"" in the knee.

The Mayo Clinic refers to the ACL as ""one of the strong bands of tissue that help connect your thigh bone (femur) to your shinbone (tibia)."" Injuries to the ligament can lead to swelling, loss of stability in the knee and an inability to bear weight, depending on the severity of the injury.

ACL injuries are common among football players, and in any sports that commonly ""involve sudden stops or changes in direction, jumping or landing,"" per the Mayo Clinic. Treatment for the injury varies, but the malady often has to be surgically repaired.

How long is ACL tear recovery time for NFL players?

Recovery from ACL reconstruction surgery varies from person to person.

However, football players typically require ""up to 9 to 12 months of rehabilitation"" to recover from the procedure, according to Medline Plus.

When will Patrick Mahomes return?

Given the anticipated recovery time, it's still unclear exactly when Mahomes will make his return next season. If all goes well with his rehab, we could see the three-time Super Bowl MVP suit up by around mid-September at the earliest.","https://www.news-leader.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/15/USNK/87775367007-getty-images-2251916304.jpg?crop=2866,1612,x0,y0&width=2866&height=1612&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-16 13:02:51.263402

Macdonald explains Seahawks’ strategy behind game-winning decision vs Colts

The Seahawks are set up for a pivotal divisional clash when they host the Los Angeles Rams in a matchup of teams tied for the best record in the NFC. The winner gains sole possession of first place in the NFC West and the inside track on earning the conference’s No. 1 seed.

The good news for the Seahawks heading into the matchup? The Rams could be without standout wide receiver Davante Adams after he aggravated a right hamstring injury during Los Angeles’ win over the Detroit Lions on Sunday.

Adams went down while running a route early in the fourth quarter and did not return to the game.

Head coach Sean McVay on Sunday said he wouldn’t rule out Adams for the showdown in Seattle, but that “it didn’t look good.” On Monday, Adams was listed with a knee injury in addition to his hamstring issue on the Rams’ practice report. He was listed as “did not participate,” though his team did not practice and all designations were only estimates. NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport also reported Adams is week-to-week.

Adams, 32, has amassed an NFL-best 14 touchdown receptions while hauling in 60 passes for 789 yards as one part of the Rams’ standout wide receiver tandem alongside Puka Nacua.

If Adams is held out against the Seahawks, just how much would his absence impact a Rams offense that is second in the league with 257.1 passing yards per game? Seahawks Radio Network analyst and former NFL wide receiver Michael Bumpus was asked that question during Seattle Sports’ Bump and Stacy.

Bumpus emphasized Adams’ impact in the red zone, calling the 6-foot-1 receiver the “red-zone champion of the world.” However, he has plenty of confidence that quarterback Matthew Stafford and head coach Sean McVay will find other ways to move the ball if Adams is out.

“Look, I think the Rams have an offense and a quarterback with a coordinator that will find ways to get other people open. I think in between the 20s, (the Rams will) be fine,” Bumpus said. “You get down to that red zone, that’s where Adams shines a bit more. So yeah, you lose a guy like him, it’s gonna affect your offense a bit. But also, come on, we’re talking Matthew Stafford and Sean McVay. They’re gonna make sure whoever up next is ready.”

When the Seahawks faced the Rams earlier this season in Los Angeles, they did a better job than any team has this year bottling up Adams. They held the 12th-year pro to just a 1-yard TD reception on eight targets. It’s one of 13 times Adams has been held to one catch or fewer in 178 career games.

Defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos (hamstring) will resume practice this week.","Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall paid the price for coming up with an important third-down conversion as the 49ers held a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter against the Tennessee Titans on Sunday.

Pearsall aggravated a right knee injury that sidelined him for six games earlier this season, 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said on a conference call with Bay Area reporters on Monday.

“He landed on his knee and it’s a painful thing,” Shanahan said. “Hopefully, it’s not at all like when he first did it. But it does take time for that pain to go away. Hopefully, that’ll be sooner than later over these next eight days.”

The 49ers are back in action in Week 16 against the Colts on Monday night in Indianapolis.

Shanahan said he is not sure if Pearsall will be able to practice this week or play on Monday due to knee and ankle injuries. The 49ers return to practice on Wednesday.

Pearsall sustained an injury to the posterior cruciate ligament in the 49ers’ Week 4 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars when he landed hard on his right knee. He returned to action seven weeks later.

Pearsall caught six passes for 96 yards in the 49ers’ 37-24 victory over the Titans on Sunday. He again banged his right knee on a 12-yard reception to convert a third-and-11 situation. That play helped set up Eddy Piñeiro’s 40-yard field goal with 1:10 remaining in the game.

Find the latest San Francisco 49ers news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California.

Pearsall avoided a high-ankle sprain at the end of an 8-yard reception on the 49ers’ first play of the game when rookie safety Kevin Winston Jr. dragged him down.

Winston, who was not penalized on the play, appeared to make an illegal hip-drop tackle. Winston is likely to get fined, as he was earlier this season for a similar tackle against New England.

“No doubt,” Shanahan answered when asked if Winston was guilty of a hip-drop tackle. “That one will be an easy one for them to see. That’s the definition of one.”

Left guard Spencer Burford, who sat out the final nine plays of the game with knee and ankle issues, checked out fine, Shanahan said. Burford should be available to practice this week.

The 49ers expect the following players who sat out Sunday’s game to be cleared to practice: Defensive linemen Jordan Elliott (knee) and Sam Okuayinonu (ankle), and linebackers Tatum Bethune (ankle) and Eric Kendricks (calf). Kendricks is a veteran whom the 49ers signed to the practice squad three weeks ago.

Defensive lineman Yetur Gross-Matos (hamstring) will resume practice this week. The 49ers opened his practice window as he aims to return off injured reserve.

This is the first major injury of Parsons' NFL career.
Parsons posted a message on social media on Monday afternoon, calling the injury his ""greatest test"" and vowed to ""rise again.""
Given the timetable for most ACL recoveries, it's possible that Parsons will miss games to start next season.
Parsons' injury not only hit hard in the Packers' locker room but also around the league, especially with his former Dallas Cowboys teammates.","An MRI on Monday confirmed that Green Bay Packers defensive end Micah Parsons sustained a season-ending torn ACL in his left knee, a source told ESPN.

Parsons' knee buckled without contact while he was chasing Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix in the third quarter of the Packers' 34-26 loss in Denver on Sunday.

This is the first major injury of Parsons' NFL career. He missed four games last season because of an ankle injury but otherwise has missed only one other regular-season game since he entered the NFL in 2021.

Parsons posted a message on social media on Monday afternoon, calling the injury his ""greatest test"" and vowed to ""rise again.""

Parsons' first season with the Packers will end with 12.5 sacks, making him the first player in NFL history with at least 12 sacks in each of his first five NFL seasons.

Given the timetable for most ACL recoveries, it's possible that Parsons will miss games to start next season. The Packers typically hold out players for 10 months following ACL surgery. This year, receiver Christian Watson returned to game action 294 days after his ACL tear. A similar timeline would have Parsons back in early October next season, meaning he could miss at least four games.

Defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley will have to find another way to generate pressure on opposing quarterbacks. Parsons led the NFL with 64 pressures, according to ESPN Analytics. The next-closest Packers player in terms of pressures is Rashan Gary with 28. The difference of 36 is the largest gap between any team's top two leaders this season.

""For the rest of the season, what we got, three more opportunities?"" Gary said after the game. ""Watch how the front play. We had a meeting at the end, brought all the guys up, understanding that there's going to be a lot of opportunities the next three weeks and we've got to take advantage of it, so you're going to see how we play.""

Gary said he initiated the meeting with his fellow defensive linemen.

""Just got to find a way to be consistent to get to where we want to be as a team,"" he said. ""We've got to shut things down up front, be more aggressive, how we've been and always be on the same page as 11 but especially as a four up front.""

Parsons' injury not only hit hard in the Packers' locker room but also around the league, especially with his former Dallas Cowboys teammates.

""I shot him a message before the game telling him to keep his head up,"" Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott said. ""Tough game, tough business. He responded. Great message. Great attitude about it and he'll attack his rehab.""

Said Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs: ""I was devastated. As soon as I seen that happened, I texted him, made sure he was good. That's my Day 1. That's my brother, and I've been through it so I know how he's feeling right now. I just want him to keep him on y'all's prayers, make sure he's prayed up, and I'm going to make sure I'm there for him every step of the way, make sure he is good.""

That's why the Packers traded for Micah Parsons. It was a push to go from good to great. And Parsons transformed the Packers defense with his 12.5 sacks.

And now, with Parsons done for the season with a torn ACL, the worry has to be that the Packers go from a potentially great season and revert to being good.

The Packers aren't going to go away without Parsons. There's still a lot of talent. But Super Bowl dreams are much less realistic without their best player, and one of the best players in the entire NFL. Even beating the Chicago Bears for the NFC North championship becomes harder.

Parsons made that type of impact. He is third in the NFL with 79 pressures, according to Pro Football Focus. His 12.5 sacks are tied for third in the NFL. No other Packer has more than 47 pressures or 7.5 sacks. No offense to Rashan Gary or anyone else on the defense, but there's no other difference maker that's on Parsons' level, or anywhere close.

And if the Parsons injury was the only one, it would be easier. The Packers have also lost tight end Tucker Kraft, who was their best weapon in the passing game this season, as well as defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt and offensive lineman Elgton Jenkins. Include Parsons and the Packers are going forward without four key players. That's a lot to overcome.

The Packers knew they had to upgrade to chase a championship. Parsons was everything they could have asked for. Without him, it seems like a Super Bowl might be out of reach.

Panic meter: It's looking like a ""what if"" type of season for Green Bay

Patriots have a rough loss

The Patriots could have clinched the AFC East with a win on Sunday. They led 21-0 over the Bills. And they allowed Buffalo to score a touchdown on five straight drives. The Bills' 35-31 win left them with a 37.7% chance to win the division, according to DVOA.

The Patriots are still clear favorites, but 37.7% isn't insignificant. And the Bills might feel even closer after they overcame that 21-point lead with an AFC East title on the line.

It was a bad turn of events, but the Patriots shouldn't panic. They had won 10 in a row before Sunday. They still lead the division by a game over a Bills team that has a great quarterback but plenty of flaws around him. The Patriots' shot at the No. 1 seed took a hit when they lost and the Broncos won, but the first priority is winning the division. And that should still happen.

Panic meter: Every team is allowed a loss every 11 games, even if it's a big blown lead to a division rival

Buccaneers' slide continues

When Todd Bowles went on an expletive-laden rant after Tampa Bay blew a 14-point lead to the Atlanta Falcons and lost, it was out of character. It was so out of character, it seemed like a coach who needed something extreme to get his team going, since nothing else was working.

The Buccaneers should be running away with the NFC South. Instead they lost back-to-back games to the Saints and Falcons, who are a combined 9-19. Tampa Bay is fortunate they play in a bad division. The Panthers lost to the Saints on Sunday to make sure the Buccaneers didn't feel too much pressure.

In terms of the division race, the Buccaneers are fine. They're tied for first place and if they win two more games they'll take the division title. That might not be the point. Due to the ongoing struggles of the offense and the defense's inability to even slow down Kirk Cousins and the Falcons, the Buccaneers look like a team that will be immediately dismissed from the postseason, if they get there. It's a team that is playing under its talent level.

Panic meter: The Bucs' slump has exposed some major issues

Big change for Dallas' D?

The Cowboys hired Matt Eberflus to be their defensive coordinator, then traded Micah Parsons right before the season started. That didn't help him out, but the results have still been poor. Dallas ranks 31st in points allowed and 29th in yards allowed. After seeing the Cowboys defense get shredded by Vikings quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who had struggled mightily for much of the season, Jerry Jones was asked if he thought Eberflus was the right coach to run the defense.

“The adjustments that we should be making [defensively] should be with these next three games in mind,” Jones said, via The Athletic. “With three games left in the short time that we’ve got to play them in, then that will impact any adjustments that you make regarding coaching with the timeframe we’re dealing with. That’s a legit question.”

That's also not much confidence in Eberflus.

But some injury concerns with two wide receivers could play a big factor in the success Chicago has down the stretch.

With Rome Odunze set to play on Sunday despite a heel injury, the wide receiver aggravated that injury and was ruled OUT minutes before kickoff. Now, head coach Ben Johnson says that all options are on the table in terms of potentially shutting Odunze down for the season.

""All options are on the table. We're going to do what's best for Rome first and foremost,"" Johnson said on Monday. ""I know he wants to be out there and helping. It's hard to tell him no sometimes. He just wants to be out on the field competing, contributing, and helping our team win. So there may be a case where we have to protect him from himself a little bit and just make sure we get him right, and he'll be able to help us down the road.""

That doesn't seem good.

Earlier in the season, Odunze mentioned how his heel injury could take some time and that he was playing through the pain. However, he missed the game against Green Bay, and while he practiced last week, he couldn't get to the point where he was comfortable enough to play. The wide receiver has 44 receptions for 661 yards and six touchdowns in 12 games.

Losing Odunze would be a big blow to the Bears' offense as he's been Caleb Williams' top target this season. In his place on Sunday, both DJ Moore and Luther Burden III stepped up for the Bears in terms of receivers. But Burden also suffered an ankle injury.

Johnson did have a better update but it's something that could impact him this week against Green Bay.

""His ankle is something we're working through and talking about,"" Johnson said. ""We'll see how this week goes in terms of whether we will have him available for Saturday night or not, but it's more of a day-by-day type of deal with him.""

While Burden got off to a slower start this season, he's played better as the year has gone on. Sunday's game was another promising one for the rookie before he had to leave with the injury.

Losing either of them for a significant time would hurt the Bears in their playoff push. Both injuries are certainly something to monitor moving forward.",https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/973/493/13493973.jpg?width=1200&height=628&crop=1.91:1&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-16 13:03:04.271517

When the final whistle was blown, they had been defeated with a final score of 35-31.

Despite the result, there are silver linings to take away from the game. Among them is the fact that the Patriots seemingly escaped without any major injury issues. So, let’s assess the damage after rewatching the game.

Patriots injury analysis: Week 15

CB Carlton Davis III: On the first play of the Bills’ second drive of the second half, Davis was covering wide receiver Joshua Palmer down the field on an eventual incomplete pass when he seemed to experience some discomfort following a cut. He took himself out of the contest at 9:09 left in the third quarter, and after a brief stint in the medical tent headed for the locker room. Officially announced as questionable with a groin issue, the veteran defender returned with 9:49 to go in the game after having missed 23 defensive snaps. He finished the game without any visible limitations.

CB Marcus Jones: Also not showing any signs of injury on the field was Marcus Jones. However, the team captain was later spotted walking slowly and with a limp in the locker room, indicating that he was nursing some sort of ailment coming out of the contest. The exact nature and severity of it are not known yet, but Jones was on the field for only 69% of defensive snaps, below his season-long average of 79%.

What this means for the Patriots

New England’s cornerback room, which already is without Alex Austin, who is on injured reserve, will be under the microscope this week. While both Carlton Davis and Marcus Jones were able to finish the game against the Bills, both appear to be below 100% heading toward the upcoming trip to Baltimore.

It remains to be seen how active they will be in the lead-up before that game against the Ravens, but both speaking with the media on Sunday can be interpreted as a positive sign. Davis even spoke about his willingness to play through injury.

“That’s just in my DNA,” he said. “I know what’s on the line and it’s so hard to watch your team play and not be able to be out there and contribute, especially when I’m needed or when it’s a close game. Obviously, we know what’s on the line, the division. We know the No. 1 seed, everything’s on the line, so I’m not going to stay out. Credit to the trainers, we came in here and did some good exercises that allowed me to get a couple drives in and that was it.”

Brian Hoyer played 15 seasons in the NFL for nine different teams.

You could feel the energy around town.

It was my third week starting at quarterback for my hometown team, the Cleveland Browns. We played the Buffalo Bills at home on a Thursday night game in 2013, and there was a lot of hype because we’d won two games in a row.

In the first half, I’ll never forget scrambling to my right and trying to get one of our receivers to go deep because there was a void in the defense. But he wasn’t able to get there so I just ran.

I slid and my back cleat got stuck in the ground at the same time Bills linebacker Kiko Alonso hit me. I stayed on the ground after the play, but my knee didn’t hurt at all. I actually thought I hurt my hip.

I walked off the field to the locker room. The Browns did some tests and X-rays, and I was sitting in the training room when the team doctor came over and told me the news.

“This has all the signs of a torn ACL,” he said.

I was very upset, breaking down and shedding some tears, which was rare for me. I felt like I had finally gotten my break. This was my first chance to really start in the NFL, and it was for the team I grew up cheering for. I was living the actual dream. And then, all of a sudden, it was ripped away from me.

Believe it or not, I had gone my entire athletic career without a significant injury. That was the tough part of the injury mentally: Why now? Why is this happening now? Couldn’t it have waited two years until I had established myself? I knew the grueling grind it was going to take to get back, but I didn’t know if I would ever get back. Nothing was guaranteed at that point.

I sat there in the locker room and Joe Banner, the Browns’ CEO, came down and checked on me. At halftime, a bunch of the players and coaches came over to check on me, too. I sat there and thought about what the next eight months would hold. I just didn’t know.

The physical pain of football is something you sign up for. But the heartbreak isn’t.

To throw another wrinkle: My wife was due with our second child at the time. We had scheduled an induction for a Tuesday later that month because it was an off day. My daughter was born on Tuesday, Oct. 15. I spent one night at the hospital, came home, spent a day together as a family and then I went into surgery early on Friday, Oct. 18.

By Sunday morning, I was starting rehab: stretching and mobility exercises.

I couldn’t drive, so every morning someone picked me up and drove me to the Browns’ facility. Every day was four to six hours of rehab. Psyching yourself up every day to do something that you know is going to be painful is not easy. It was also monotonous work.

I tried to attack rehab like I was preparing for a game. I told myself: You’re working toward something. It’s just going to take a while. And I tried to find the competitiveness in rehab.

Before my surgery, the Browns took measurements of my quad muscles and strength to establish the baseline. So each day I had something to shoot for. One of the biggest things is trying to get your flexion back, which is the bending of your knee. And every day I would not leave rehab until I got at least one more degree of flexion. Even if it seemed small, it was one of the only things I could see progress in.

When I hit one of those little milestones, I felt better.

I had just tasted what I was trying to get — a starting job in the NFL — and it motivated me each and every day to push myself to a different level. Then, to kick it into high gear, the Browns drafted Johnny Manziel in the first round right in the middle of my rehab. I was like: OK, I’ve got to get back even faster.

I probably drove Joe Sheehan, the Browns’ trainer, nuts because with each progression I’d tell him: “I can do more. Let me do more.” On Halloween, 13 days after surgery, I walked around our neighborhood with a knee brace, taking my son trick or treating. On Christmas Eve, I was running on a zero gravity treadmill. I pushed myself to the limits.

Joe lived not too far from me, and I’d ride my bike by his house to see if he was outside, just so I could show him that I was fine and that I was ready to practice.

Every single day I tried to come to rehab with the mentality that “I’ve got to get just a little bit healthier today, even if it’s going to suck.” We all face adversity in a lot of different ways. I was primed for it. My career started off with adversity. Didn’t get drafted, made it as a backup quarterback to Tom Brady with the Patriots, got cut in New England and was out of football for 10 weeks. This injury was another thing to overcome.

I played in New England for Bill Belichick. Every day was adversity. He created it that way, and that’s why those teams were so tough. At some point, the mental side takes over the physical. If you don’t have that, you’re going to break. During rehab, I drew on that experience.

I was back in training camp the following year and had my first “oh shoot” moment. Quarterbacks aren’t supposed to get hit in practice, right? Well, there was a play in training camp where I got drilled in my lower half. My first thought was to check if my knee was OK after taking that hit. Once I got past that moment, I was thankful for it because I felt confident again.

In hindsight, one thing I can say for sure: Although I wouldn’t wish this injury on anyone, grinding through that long rehab made me mentally tougher.

Here are the top takeaways from Shanahan following Sunday's win:

Injury Updates Bring Cautious Optimism

Shanahan opened with a mostly encouraging injury report, noting several players are trending towards returning to practice this week. Offensive lineman Spencer Burford and defensive lineman Jordan Elliott are both expected to practice after having their knee issues checked out. Linebackers Eric Kendricks and Tatum Bethune, along with defensive lineman Sam Okuayinonu, are also expected back on the field.

Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall remains the primary concern after re-aggravating his PCL injury while also dealing with an ankle sprain. Shanahan acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding Pearsall's availability, explaining the knee issue can be painful but manageable depending on how he responds over the next few days.

""There is a concern,"" Shanahan said. ""Hopefully, it's not at all like it was when he first did it… and hopefully that'll be sooner than later over these next eight days.""

Pearsall finished Sunday's contest with six receptions for a team-leading 96 yards, averaging 16 yards per catch.

Purdy Delivers Another Strong Performance

Shanahan praised quarterback Brock Purdy for his decision-making and playmaking ability, calling it one of his better performances of the season.

""I thought Brock had a really good game,"" Shanahan said. ""There were also a couple plays that he made when it didn't seem like anything was there.""

Purdy completed 23-of-30 passes for 295 yards and three touchdowns, finishing with a season-high passer rating of 140.3. He also added seven rushes for 44 yards, including a career-long 26-yard run. While Shanahan added that it wasn't flawless, Purdy consistently extended plays and capitalized when opportunities presented themselves, helping the offense score on each of its first five drives and register its most efficient start of the season.

Offensive Line Answers the Challenge Up Front

Facing one of the league's most disruptive interior defenders in Titans DT Jeffery Simmons, Shanahan felt the offensive line rose to the occasion. Simmons made his presence felt, but Shanahan credited the group for its physicality.

""I thought our O-Line played well. Simmons was still a problem. He is a hell of a player. We knew that going in and feel just the same if not stronger going out. It was tough when we didn't have two guys on him like you see on tape. He's very good at beating his one-on-ones. I felt like when we got two guys on him, we handled him pretty well. But, he kept competing through the game. A lot of respect for him in that way. And I loved how our guys competed against him because he's a very big talent and he plays with the right demeanor and how physical and violent he plays. I loved how our guys were up for the challenge.""

The offensive line's performance helped fuel an offense that finished with zero punts and allowed Purdy time to distribute the ball effectively. Left tackle Trent Williams stood out in particular, earning high praise from Shanahan for his performance in both the run and pass game, earning a career-high 95.6 PFF grade.

""He had a hell of a game,"" Shanahan said. ""I've been very excited with how Trent's been this year.""

Rookie Class Continues to Build for the Future

Shanahan expressed continued confidence in the 49ers rookie class, even as some young players have seen fewer snaps in recent weeks due to returning veterans and improved depth.

""I've been very encouraged with them,"" Shanahan said. ""I think we've got the right type of guys.""

He highlighted defensive lineman Alfred Collins as a player who has shown flashes of what the team envisioned, while emphasizing there is still room to grow. Collins has been part of a defensive front that continues to rotate players and build depth as the season continues.

""I like where he is,"" Shanahan said, ""but I'm also more excited about what I think he can be.""

Looking Ahead

He reportedly faces a nine-month recovery, at least.

Parsons posted a message on social media, calling his injury ""my greatest test,"" and saying he will rise again.

""I may be sidelined, but I am not defeated. This injury is my greatest test—a moment God allowed to strengthen my testimony. I believe He walks with me through this storm and chose me for this fight because He knew my heart could carry it. I'm deeply grateful to the Packers organization and my teammates for their unwavering support, love, and belief in me during this season. I trust His timing, His plan, and His purpose. I will rise again.""

The injury occurred during a first-and-10 in the third quarter, when Parsons fought his way to Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, but planted awkwardly with his left leg. He immediately went down holding his knee.

Parsons remained on the turf for several moments as he was attended to by trainers. Players from both teams took knees around the star pass rusher -- who was eventually got up and walked to the locker room with the medical staff.

Parsons' recovery timeline could carry deep into the offseason and threaten his availability for the 2026 opener. While ACL recoveries generally take 6-8 months, CBS Sports injury analyst Marty Jaramillo says that Parsons' explosiveness as an edge rusher could force him to ease back into action more slowly than if he played a different position.

""When you have that kind of speed, that talent that he was born with … that's going to delay the rehab just a little bit,"" Jaramillo said on CBS Sports HQ. ""Once we get the ACL healed and he strengthens his entire body and he's ready to start running, then we start adding change of direction. The constant cutting in all directions with also stop-go acceleration, that's the real window. We're going to look at him in possibly 8-10 months for an athlete at that position, someone as explosive as Micah Parsons.""

Entering Sunday, Parsons recorded 39 tackles, 12.5 sacks, 26 QB hits and a forced fumble. He became the first player since sacks became an official stat in 1982 to begin a career with five seasons of at least 12 sacks.

While the season-ending injuries drew the headlines, the broader Week 15 NFL injury updates painted an equally concerning picture.
Zooming out, Week 15 underscored the NFL’s annual attrition phase.
Week 15 of the NFL season also reignited discussions around surface safety and workload management.
Week 15 will be remembered not for scores or standings, but for how abruptly it redefined possibility.","The NFL entered a defining moment in Week 15, as a wave of devastating injuries reshaped the league’s competitive balance and altered the postseason outlook in dramatic fashion. NFL injuries are part of the sport’s reality, but the timing and severity of what unfolded created one of the most jarring late-season shifts in recent memory. Week 15 NFL action delivered a harsh reminder that depth charts, not star power, often determine how far teams survive into January.

The most seismic blow landed when Patrick Mahomes went down for the Kansas City Chiefs. The star quarterback suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee and was ruled out for the remainder of the season. The injury occurred during live action and immediately changed the trajectory of Kansas City’s year. Combined with the Chiefs’ loss and the Denver Broncos’ win, the result officially eliminated Kansas City from postseason contention, closing the door on meaningful playoff aspirations.

Mahomes has been the constant in the Chiefs’ run of sustained success, rarely missing time and often masking structural flaws elsewhere on the roster. His absence creates an immediate vacuum at the most valuable position in the sport. The offense now shifts into survival mode, leaning on a backup quarterback while recalibrating expectations. In the broader NFL playoff picture, Kansas City’s removal from contention opens space in a crowded AFC field that suddenly feels far less predictable.

Just hours later, another cornerstone fell when Green Bay Packers superstar Micah Parsons suffered a torn ACL in a road loss vs. the Broncos. The injury ended his season and delivered a crushing blow to Green Bay’s defensive identity. Parsons served as the engine of the Packers’ front seven, generating pressure without schematic compromise. Losing him strips the defense of its most disruptive element at the worst possible time.

The Packers had positioned themselves as a legitimate contender built on balance and defensive versatility. Without Parsons, that equation changes dramatically. Pass-rush efficiency declines, coverage stress increases, and game-planning margins evaporate. In a conference defined by elite quarterbacks, Green Bay now faces the reality that even strong team structure struggles to survive without a true defensive closer.

While the season-ending injuries drew the headlines, the broader Week 15 NFL injury updates painted an equally concerning picture. Davante Adams exited with a non-contact hamstring injury for the Los Angeles Rams, immediately casting doubt over his availability on a short week. Soft-tissue injuries at this stage of the season rarely resolve quickly, and the Rams now face the challenge of redistributing targets without their most reliable receiving option.

Green Bay’s injury troubles extended beyond Parsons. Christian Watson suffered a chest injury that required hospital evaluation during the game. Although he was later released, the sequence raised immediate concern about internal damage or structural trauma. His status moving forward remains uncertain, and any missed time further strains an already compromised offense. Zach Tom also failed to return after sustaining an undisclosed injury, thinning the offensive line and compounding protection issues.

Elsewhere across the league, the Chicago Bears received relatively better news when Luther Burden III avoided major ankle damage. The wide receiver remains day to day, giving Chicago optimism that his explosiveness can return quickly with proper management. For the New Orleans Saints, Devin Neal’s hamstring injury presents a more complicated situation. Running backs rely heavily on burst and change of direction, and late-season hamstring issues often linger without careful workload control.

Zooming out, Week 15 underscored the NFL’s annual attrition phase. By mid-December, teams operate without the safety net of roster flexibility. The trade deadline has passed, practice squads are stretched thin, and replacements rarely replicate the impact of injured stars. Losing generational talents at this point forces organizations into schematic compromises rather than true substitutions.

The AFC now looks markedly different without Mahomes looming over the bracket. Teams that previously planned for an inevitable showdown with Kansas City suddenly find the path more navigable. The absence removes not just a player, but a psychological barrier that influenced preparation and pacing throughout the season. In contrast, the NFC feels vulnerable rather than open. Green Bay remains competitive, but without Parsons, the margin for error shrinks against offenses built to exploit weakened pass rushes.

Week 15 of the NFL season also reignited discussions around surface safety and workload management. Clusters of severe knee injuries often lead to league-wide introspection, particularly when non-contact mechanisms are involved. While no single factor explains ACL tears, the convergence of fatigue, field conditions, and cumulative strain becomes harder to ignore in December football.

The idea of “next man up” resonates emotionally, but reality rarely supports it. Depth players provide effort and professionalism, yet production gaps remain unavoidable when replacing players of Mahomes’ or Parsons’ caliber. Coaches adjust game plans, but ceilings lower. Expectations recalibrate. Contention becomes endurance rather than dominance.

As the NFL moves toward the postseason, the league does so with a reshuffled hierarchy. Week 15 will be remembered not for scores or standings, but for how abruptly it redefined possibility. The road to Super Bowl LX now belongs to the healthiest teams, not necessarily the most talented ones.",https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Patrick-Mahomes_373dc6.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 12:02:43.613276

Patrick Mahomes injury details

Following testing, Mahomes was officially diagnosed with a torn ACL on Sunday night, per ESPN's Adam Schefter. He also tore his LCL, per Ian Rapoport.

""An MRI has confirmed that Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes sustained a torn ACL in his left knee in today’s game,"" the Chiefs said in a statement. ""Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options.""

The Chiefs then said Monday that Mahomes had already undergone his surgery for the torn ACL, doing so in Dallas.

""Patrick Mahomes successfully underwent surgery in Dallas this evening with Dr. Dan Cooper to repair the tear in his left ACL,"" the Chiefs said in a statement. ""Mahomes will begin his rehab process immediately.""

Mahomes also shared a message to fans on social media.

""Don’t know why this had to happen. And not going to lie [it] hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again,"" Mahomes wrote. ""Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever.""

After Week 15, Andy Reid said he was set to undergo an MRI to determine the severity and that it “didn’t look good.”

In the fourth quarter against the Chargers, Mahomes was tackled to the ground, and in the process, he had his leg get pulled on a bit while caught under his defender.

He remained on the ground in pain, grabbing at his left knee.

Mahomes was then helped back to the locker room, before tests confirmed his torn ACL.

ACL recovery time in the NFL

The recovery time for ACL injuries in the NFL is dependent on the severity. Mahomes' is considered fully torn, per the Chiefs, but his official timetable for recovery has not yet been revealed. Following surgery, the Chiefs said Mahomes would ""begin his rehab process immediately.""

Because ACLs are responsible for many rapid movements, especially in football, the average recovery time can be anywhere from 6-12 months in the NFL, with a wide range based on the extent of the tear, whether not surgery is required, the player's age, and plenty more.

Per Bass Medical Group, a torn ACL that requires surgery and rehab typically carries an 8-12 month recovery timeline in the NFL. Meanwhile, a mild MCL sprain is a 2-6 week recovery, and a complete MCL rupture is 3-6 months.

Torn ACL grades

The severity of a torn ACL is determined in a grading system, like some other injuries.

Grade 1 (mild stretch)

The least severe type of ACL injury is a Grade 1 ailment, which means the ligament was stretched but is still intact. In this case, someone may have some mild pain and swelling, but it would not require surgery.

Grade 2 (partial tear)

A Grade 2 ACL tear means the ligament is loose, or partially torn. Surgery may depend on the severity of the injury, as it can sometimes heal non-surgically.

Grade 3 (complete tear)

The worst-case scenario with ACL injuries is a complete tear, which is a Grade 3. The ligament is in two pieces, leading to knee instability and more severe pain. This often requires surgery to repair.

Notable NFL players with torn ACLs

In the 2025 season alone, recent NFL players to be diagnosed with torn ACLs, in some capacity, include New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers, Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz and Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr.

Nabers' injury came in September, and an MRI confirmed a season-ending torn ACL. He is expected to return by the start of the 2026 season.

Ertz's injury was more recent, as he took a big hit in Week 14 that resulted in a torn ACL diagnosis. It's unknown whether the veteran tight end will retire, but he likely wouldn't be able to return until mid-way through the 2026 season.",https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/crop_style_16_9_desktop_webp/s3/2025-12/USATSI_27816130.jpg.webp?itok=Ihok0RKG,N,,2025-12-16 13:03:08.822555

The Washington Commanders are playing it safe with their franchise quarterback, as Jayden Daniels has been shut down for the remaining three games of the 2025 season.

Daniels’ return under center didn’t go as planned, leaving the contest against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 14 early after reaggravating his elbow injury while chasing down Andrew Van Ginkel following an interception.

After seeing his backup, Marcus Mariota, perform well in his place against the New York Giants in a win on Sunday, head coach Dan Quinn announced on Monday the team’s decision for Daniels, the reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year.

Quinn told reporters that it was ""part medical, part team"" when it came to how they decided to move forward with Daniels.

While he won’t be participating on gameday, Daniels will continue practicing with the team as they look to finish strong. The Commanders, 4-10 on the season, have already been eliminated from playoff contention.

COMMANDERS' JAYDEN DANIELS TAKES HIT AFTER INTERCEPTION, RE-INJURES SHOULDER

This is obviously not how Daniels, or anyone in the Commanders building, wanted this season to go after reaching the NFC Championship Game in 2024. But the second overall pick from the 2024 NFL Draft has been mired with injuries all season, starting with a knee sprain in Week 2.

After missing two games with that ailment, Daniels returned only to suffer a hamstring strain in Week 7 that caused him to miss a game. The big injury, though, was Week 9 when he suffered a brutal elbow injury that was tough to look at in a blowout loss to the Seattle Seahawks at home, 38-14.

Daniels burst onto the NFL scene as one of the best quarterbacks in football last season, leading the Commanders to a 12-5 record and immediately changing the trajectory of a franchise that hadn’t reached the NFC Championship Game since their Super Bowl-winning season in 1991. Washington was blown out by their NFC East-rival Philadelphia Eagles, who went on to win Super Bowl LIX, but it was certainly a successful season as the team hit on their quarterback selection.

But as Daniels battled injuries this season, the Commanders couldn’t remain afloat. In fact, they snapped an eight-game losing streak on Sunday with their 29-21 win over the Giants.

Mariota has been serviceable in Daniels’ absence despite the results. He’s thrown for 1,600 yards with 10 touchdowns and seven interceptions, while rushing for 298 yards and a score.

The 32-year-old was 10-of-19 for 211 yards with one touchdown in the win over New York at MetLife Stadium.

It is a significant loss for the one of the league's best defenses given Jones was the team's third-leading tackler (78 tackles) and had played 93% of the defensive snaps this season. Jones left Sunday's 34-26 victory over the Green Bay Packers in the second half and did not return.

He is the second starter in the Broncos' secondary who will have missed time with a chest injury. Star cornerback Pat Surtain II missed three games earlier this season with a pectoral injury. Surtain has played in the past three games with a brace on his left arm and shoulder.

It is unknown if Jones will need surgery to repair the injury, but at minimum he will miss the Broncos' final three games of the regular season and a playoff game.

P.J. Locke played in Jones' spot when Jones left Sunday's game and coach Sean Payton said Monday morning Locke had performed ""real well.""

Jones, who signed with the Broncos in free agency in 2024, is an important part of the secondary that has held opposing quarterbacks to the second-lowest QBR this season (48.4, behind only the Houston Texans at 47.7). The Broncos also lead the NFL in sacks with 58.

The Broncos lead the NFL in man coverage snaps as well with three players, including Jones, who have played the most man-to-man snaps in the league thus far this season. Broncos cornerback Riley Moss leads the NFL with 334 man coverage snaps, safety Talanoa Hufanga is second (315) and Jones is third (303).

For Chiefs fans, that should be disconcerting.
Mahomes wouldn’t be the first NFL quarterback to have suffered a devastating leg injury and come back to make a run at a Super Bowl.
But few things are guaranteed in the NFL, which is why Chiefs fans and fans of football in general should savor the memories of Mahomes over his epic nine-season run.
Add those to a run of three Super Bowl wins in six years.","When future sports historians wax poetic about the Kansas City Chiefs’ dynasty and the remarkable championship era of the NFL team’s star quarterback Patrick Mahomes, there’s a great chance they’ll recall Dec. 14, 2025, as the end date for both. Even though we have every reason to believe the three-time Super Bowl MVP and two-time NFL MVP will be back, it’s harder to imagine him returning to a Chiefs team that will look the same as it does now: on the field or on the sideline.

In the fourth quarter in a losing effort against the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, the 30-year-old Mahomes, one of the most electrifying athletes of his NFL generation, tore the anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, in his left knee, the team announced.

ACL tears, which damage the ligament that stabilizes the knee, are catastrophic for any athlete, but especially devastating for an NFL signal caller known for creating huge, sometimes jaw-dropping, moments that start with him using his legs to extend plays.

And that’s what Mahomes was doing before he was hurt Sunday: extending a play. With the Chiefs trailing by three in the fourth quarter and their playoff hopes dangling, Mahomes eluded a defensive pass rush and threw the ball away just before he was hit.

His knee buckled awkwardly. He writhed on the turf, clutching his injured leg. But because he walked off the field, he gave Chiefs fans a glimmer of hope that the injury wasn’t as bad as it looked. A postgame MRI scan revealed no such luck. Mahomes’ season is over and with it went the Chiefs’ chance to tie a record set by the New England Patriots and make the playoffs for an eleventh consecutive year.

The Chiefs, who appeared in five of the past six Super Bowls and won three of them, might not be back for a long time. Rehab from an ACL tear generally takes about a year, so with Mahomes going down in mid-December, next season is likely out of the question. It could be September 2027 before we see him in another NFL regular-season game.

The Chiefs have $450 million invested in Mahomes via a contract that doesn’t expire until 2032, so there’s every reason to believe he’ll get the best possible care and an extensive rehab to return to form, but it’s certainly worth wondering whether he’ll have the same mobility or whether his throwing motion could be altered by the lower-body injury.

It’s also worth wondering about what the Chiefs’ roster will look like when he’s back. His most reliable weapon, 36-year-old tight end Travis Kelce, has said he plans to decide about retirement after this season. With three Super Bowl rings, more than $111 million in career football earnings, a popular podcast with his brother Jason and an impending marriage to Taylor Swift, Kelce has every reason to walk away.

Must reads from Today's list

Several other crucial Chiefs players could also leave in free agency.

Chiefs Coach Andy Reid, considered an offensive genius, who has three Super Bowl rings as a head coach and another as an assistant coach, is the only head coach that Mahomes has had since he was drafted in 2017. But at 67, Reid is the NFL’s second-oldest head coach. Will he fancy trudging through a season without the quarterback-receiver duo at the center of his offense, only to have to rebuild around Mahomes the season after next? Or will Reid call it a career?

The Chiefs’ front office won’t allow that much organizational change in Mahomes’ absence and without his consultation. But free agency, the NFL’s hard salary cap and Father Time will limit how much they can control and how much stability they might be able to provide their star when he’s game ready again.

For Chiefs fans, that should be disconcerting. Mahomes wouldn’t be the first NFL quarterback to have suffered a devastating leg injury and come back to make a run at a Super Bowl. His old rival, Brady, returned to win multiple Super Bowls after tearing both his ACL and his medial collateral ligament, or MCL, in 2008, at age 31. It’s entirely possible.

But few things are guaranteed in the NFL, which is why Chiefs fans and fans of football in general should savor the memories of Mahomes over his epic nine-season run. Those memories include having the most wins by a QB in his first 100 starts, becoming the quickest quarterback to pass 30,000 yards and for breaking the record for the number of touchdowns in a quarterback’s first eight seasons. Add those to a run of three Super Bowl wins in six years.

We may never see anything like that again.","https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1765824616/251215-mahomes-kelce-reid-chiefs-zz/251215-mahomes-kelce-reid-chiefs-zz.jpg?_i=AA",N,,2025-12-16 07:02:07.126429

(ABC-Australia) There are just three weeks of action left in the regular NFL season, and while the perennially in contention Chiefs have been knocked out already, another contender suffered a major blow to its defence.

Here are the five quick hits from the week 15 action.

1. Mahomes tears his ACL as Kansas City’s season ends

Patrick Mahomes tore the ACL in his left knee while trying to keep the Kansas City Chiefs’s post-season hopes alive in the waning seconds of a 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, and the team said the star quarterback was considering surgical options.

It’s the most significant injury of a superlative nine-year career for Mahomes, a two-time MVP who has led the Chiefs to three Super Bowl titles and reached the AFC championship game in each of his seven previous seasons as Kansas City’s starter.

This year, the Chiefs won’t even make the playoffs, and Mahomes won’t be back on the field until sometime in 2026.

The Chiefs had just crossed midfield with less than two minutes to go when Mahomes scrambled toward the Kansas City sideline, then tried to get rid of the ball. He was spun to the ground upon release by Chargers defensive lineman Da’Shawn Hand, and he immediately grabbed at his left knee while trainers converged on him.

Mahomes was eventually helped to the blue injury tent on the sideline, but he only stayed there for a few moments. He soon emerged with staff members on either side of him, limping toward the locker room with a white towel draped over his head.

“He will get an MRI tomorrow or this evening,” coach Andy Reid said.

“Whenever we can.”

2. Packers star Parsons hurts his knee as Green Bay suffers costly loss

Green Bay Packers pass rushing star Micah Parsons was helped off the field after injuring his left knee on a non-contact play late in the third quarter against Denver.

He was later ruled out of the game.

Parsons blew past right tackle Mike McGlinchey and was chasing after Broncos quarterback Bo Nix when he suddenly pulled up and fell to the ground. He clutched his knee as trainers and teammates came over to check on him.

It was the second significant injury for the Packers, who lost receiver Christian Watson to a chest injury.

Parsons was having a big game. He forced an early fumble and was credited with a pass break-up.

Without their star defender, the Packers went down 34-26 in a loss that could have major playoff ramifications.

3. Old man Rivers throws a touchdown as students watch on

Much was made of the return of 44-year-old father of 10 and grandfather of one Philip Rivers to the NFL this week, and the old man almost pulled off a miracle for the Colts.

Rivers, who came out of retirement and signed to the Colts last week after a string of injuries to the team’s quarterbacks, threw a touchdown as Indianapolis lost 18-16 to the Seahawks thanks to a last minute record-breaking field goal by Jason Myers.

Rivers only threw for 120 yards and did toss an interception in a moment of desperation late in the game, but he showed enough that he should be able to keep the starting position until his injured teammates return.

The former Chargers legend now coaches at a high school, with vision showing his students getting up and about after their coach threw the TD against one of the best defences in the league.

4. Trump’s coin toss goes viral during Army-Navy game

Still on American Football but away from the NFL, US President Donald Trump went viral with a bizarre attempt at a coin toss before a Navy and Army game.

The 79-year-old was handed the coin to decide which team would receive the ball, and then proceeded to loft the coin into the air, rather than the more — traditional — flick of the coin.

“President Trump’s coin toss will go down in the history books,” Barstool Sports wrote on X, with the video seen more than 4 million times.

Navy went on to beat Army 17-16 in a tight clash.

5. Commanders end their losing streak, hand one to the Giants

Marcus Mariota emerged from the Washington Commanders’s first victory celebration since October 5 with a sense of relief.

Beating the New York Giants 29-21 ended their season-derailing skid at eight games.

“There’s nothing like a winning locker room,” Mariota said.

“It’s hard to go two months without winning a football game.”

Now their opponent is stuck with that feeling. The Giants (2-12), who lost their eighth in a row, have not won since October 9.

The only NFL game this week with no playoff implications had a far bigger bearing on draft positioning.

The Giants in defeat moved a step closer to the top pick, a last-place finish in the NFC East and potentially front-office changes, with a coaching search already coming.",https://i0.wp.com/islandtimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/island-times-logo.png?fit=500%2C135&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-16 03:58:20.821321

Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray tore his ACL in 2022, Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow tore his as a rookie back in 2020, and Tom Brady tore his in the 2008 season opener. In fact, Mahomes and Brady both tore the ACL in their left knee during their ninth NFL season.

During a recent taping of the ""Let's Go!"" podcast, Brady spoke about the rehab process and why it's ""a hard psychological thing to battle.""

""It's a tough rehab,"" Brady said. ""It's one of the toughest rehabs. I just remember every day pushing myself. And it's always the same amount of pain and discomfort except you're making progress through that pain and discomfort, which is a hard psychological thing to battle. You feel like, God, every day, it doesn't feel right. Except you're gaining range of motion and you're gaining strength and you are on the road to recovery. So I wish him the very best.""

The host of the podcast, Jim Gray, then asked Brady what he would tell Mahomes if he could offer any advice about coming back from a torn ACL. The NFL legend said it's all about attacking the process.

""The only thing you can do is focus on what's ahead of you and not look back,"" Brady said. ""And just say, 'OK, this is part of what my career is going to be and a lot of people have gone through it and a lot of people have overcome it.' You've just got to put as much diligence into the rehab process. And I always feel like the faster you rehab, the faster you can get back to practicing the sport that you love.

""I think sometimes people will pace themselves. Instead of training mode, they're in rehab mode. I think you gotta get through rehab mode as fast as possible and then you get back to training mode. But that requires an all-out commitment and it's the same commitment that the great professional athletes make to be great at their profession. When you go through the rehab process, you need that same level of focus and determination.""

When Brady returned to the field in 2009, he led the New England Patriots to the playoffs with a 10-6 record, and won Comeback Player of the Year. It's safe to say the 2008 knee injury didn't hold him back, as Brady would go on to win four more Super Bowls and play until he was 45 years old.

As two of the best quarterbacks of this generation, Mahomes and Brady have been compared every which way over the last nine years, and how both successfully recovered from torn ACLs could be another bullet point in the conversation. Mahomes has already publicly vowed to attack each day ""over and over again.""",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/16/3923a513-9a73-4ee4-ad1a-aebff6412f73/thumbnail/1200x675/24843f4e7db852e892f9977609e7f6a2/tom.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 01:58:48.736488

If there’s even a 1% percent that Mahomes will makes it, he and the Chiefs will do everything in their power to make it by the Season starts.

9 months is the minimum recovery time to return to sport but every month after that you wait (up to 1 year) significantly decreases injury risk.

Washington had emphasized the need for Daniels to play more this season to continue developing.","Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels won't play the rest of the season, a decision made by the team one week after he aggravated his dislocated left elbow.

Coach Dan Quinn said Daniels still hasn't been cleared for contact and was unlikely to play Saturday vs. the Philadelphia Eagles.

Washington then has a short week before playing on Christmas Day, and Quinn said that wasn't ideal for Daniels' return. But he will continue to practice with the team.

""He is not happy that he is going to be out, but that's where we're at,"" Quinn said.

Daniels had missed six games with multiple injuries, including the dislocated elbow suffered Nov. 9. He returned to the lineup for a Dec. 7 game at Minnesota, but exited in the third quarter after falling on his elbow -- getting pushed to the ground following an interception.

After the game, Quinn said Daniels could have returned, but he said three days later that further tests showed the player had aggravated the injury.

""We thought we had a good plan for the next five [games], and I would say, 'Man plans and God laughs.'"" Quinn said. ""And so you've got a good plan and then you have a way to adjust it.""

Veteran Marcus Mariota will start the final three games for Washington (4-10), which snapped its eight-game losing streak Sunday.

Daniels has played only seven games this season, leaving each of the last three with an injury -- or, as was the case at Minnesota in Week 14, aggravating his non-throwing elbow.

The Commanders will finish the season having nine starters from their projected lineup in camp miss at least seven games. Only one starter in 2024 missed that many games.

Quinn informed Daniels of the decision Monday afternoon, saying Daniels was ""disappointed but understood."" General manager Adam Peters also spoke with Daniels on Monday. Quinn also said they discussed the decision with owner Josh Harris.

Quinn said the fact Daniels had left his last three games with an injury did not factor into the decision. And he declined to say whether Daniels would play if they were 10-4.

""We're not, so we didn't have that discussion,"" Quinn said.

Washington had emphasized the need for Daniels to play more this season to continue developing. While that's still the preferred route, Quinn said Daniels did not want to go on injured reserve so he could practice.

""The best place to do it is in a game to grow,"" Quinn said. ""But that doesn't mean you can't squeeze every ounce of energy into the practice and working through some of the specific things that we want to do. We're always going to make the best decisions for the team and the player, but it doesn't mean we can't take advantage of this time. And like I said, I hope when you talk to him a year from now, 'Man, that gave me a different vantage point.' I want him to gain something from this time, and that's what we hope to accomplish from that.""

Daniels finishes his second season with 1,262 yards, 8 touchdowns and 3 interceptions. He also rushed for 278 yards and two touchdowns.

In 2024, Daniels was named the NFL's offensive rookie of the year after throwing for 3,568 yards, 25 touchdowns and nine interceptions. He also rushed for 891 yards and six scores.

But injuries defined his second season. He sprained his left knee in Week 2 when, at the end of a scramble, he was hit by a helmet. Daniels missed two games. Then, in his third game back he injured his right hamstring when a blitzing defender tackled him in the pocket, causing him to miss one start.

He dislocated his left elbow in a Nov. 9 game vs. Seattle when he tried to score on a scramble with 7 minutes, 39 seconds left and the Commanders trailing 38-7.

Quinn said they want Daniels to improve by remaining a passer when on the move and keeping his eyes downfield.

""That's going to be a big part of what we're doing,"" Quinn said, ""knowing how important he is.""",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1215%2Fr1589807_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-16 01:58:53.564135

The Denver Broncos might be missing safety Brandon Jones down the stretch.

Jones played 34 snaps before being ruled out of Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers with a pectoral injury. P.J. Locke finished the game across from Talanoa Hufanga, playing 32 snaps on defense.

After an eventual 34-26 win, Locke provided a concerning update on his teammate.

Jones is undergoing an MRI today, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. How much time Jones could miss depends on the severity of the injury. A worst-case scenario pec injury could be season-ending, but we don't yet know the full details of the Jones injury.

Elsewhere on the injury front, Denver running back RJ Harvey left Sunday's game with a rib injury and linebacker Justin Strnad left with an ankle injury (it appeared to happen on this play).

Adams, after receiving a minute of medical treatment on the pitch, ultimately walked off under his own power but did not attempt to continue. He was replaced by Alex Scott.

Adams suffered the injury while blocking a Matheus Cunha shot less than two minutes into the match. After he and Cunha made contact with the ball simultaneously, Adams immediately fell to the ground and raised his right arm, in an apparent call for the medical staff, and in pain. He then grimaced while the athletic trainers performed manual tests on his knee. At one point, he made a twisting motion with his left hand.

He was then helped to his feet and walked toward the sideline with a limp. At one point, he broke into a brief jog, but then shook his head.

“I think its the worst news from the game, definitely,” Iraola said in his post-match press conference. “He twisted the knee. I think it’s just MCL, but we have to check and see if it is just a small sprain or something bigger.

“Obviously, it is not what we want. To lose a player like Tyler for us is massive, especially when you don’t have Lewis Cook. Alex has to play in that holding midfield position and he has done it really well, but it’s bad news for us because Tyler is massive for us.”

Adams, who captained the U.S. men’s national team at the 2022 World Cup as a 23-year-old, has been a key player for the USMNT ever since he was a teen. He has started regularly in a defensive midfield position when healthy. He has battled multiple injuries throughout his career – including going over a year between Premier League games in 2023-24 – but had established himself as a midfield force for Bournemouth this season, starting all but one Premier League match. He’d even scored two goals, including one from 47 yards out that earned him the league’s November goal of the month award.

Adams’ next games for the U.S. national team would not be until March, but those are just friendlies (against Belgium and Portugal). The main concern is his status for the 2026 World Cup, which begins June 11. The USMNT’s first group game is June 12 against Paraguay.

Bournemouth drew the game 4-4 against Manchester United, leaving them 13th in the Premier League.

Assuming a featured role in place of Najee Harris, Warren has tallied 929 scrimmage yards and six touchdowns in 12 games this season. The 27-year-old has found the end zone in three straight games, scoring a key 38-yard touchdown reception in Pittsburgh’s crucial Week 14 win over the Baltimore Ravens.

If he’s able to play, Warren could have a huge primetime opportunity against a Dolphins defense that has allowed 4.8 yards per carry this season. But Miami has turned the corner from a disastrous start, allowing 53 combined points over an ongoing four-game winning streak.

The Steelers won’t want to lose a vital playmaker ahead of another game with massive AFC North implications. Warren’s absence would likely create more opportunities for Kenneth Gainwell, who has garnered 657 scrimmage yards and six touchdowns this season.

An inactive Warren may also lead Mike Tomlin to give more reps to Kaleb Johnson. The rookie has played just three snaps in each of the last two games and has 65 rushing yards on 26 attempts this season.

Parsons, the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history, will be out for the rest of this season, and his status for the start of the 2026 season is uncertain.

Growing List

The injury to the standout Parsons adds to a similar injury on Sunday for Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is also out for the rest of the season, and Rams receiver Davante Adams, who sustained a hamstring injury against the Lions. Parsons tore the ligament while in pursuit of Broncos quarterback Bo Nix, but it was a noncontact injury.

Mahomes is also facing an extended recovery.

“[It] would be extremely fast for Mahomes to play in Week 1 next year,” said Tom Christ of Motion Stability Physical Therapy Group. “Some players have returned that fast, so not impossible, but fast.”

Will Ratings Be Hurt, Too?

Like the Chiefs, the Packers are one of the most popular NFL teams, including among TV viewers, and the loss of Parsons could impact viewership for the rest of the season. The Packers, however, remain in the mix for the 2025 playoffs, unlike Kansas City, which was eliminated on Sunday. Green Bay, with a 9-4-1 record, currently holds the final playoff slot in the National Football Conference and still has an 88% probability of reaching the postseason.

“I may be sidelined, but I am not defeated,” Parsons said in a social media post. “I will rise again.”

The injury to Adams is not as severe as Parsons’s and Mahomes’s, but the Rams are the first NFC team to clinch a playoff spot and have serious aspirations of a return to the Super Bowl.

Trade Factors

The Packers acquired Parsons just before the start of the regular season in a blockbuster trade with the Cowboys. After that deal, Parsons signed a four-year, $188 million contract with Green Bay, including $136 million in guaranteed money and representing the type of deal he unsuccessfully sought from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.

The pact is the largest for a non-quarterback in league history.

The 12.5 sacks that Parsons registered this season are tied for third in the league, and beyond that statistic, he has been a fixture in a Green Bay defense that ranks sixth in the NFL—showing the immediate payoff from the deal.

Steve Cohen’s $8 billion New York casino, at long last, is officially happening.

The Mets owner and his Metropolitan Park received full approval Monday from the New York State Gaming Commission for a gaming license. The decision paves the way for a large-scale project to be built with Hard Rock International adjacent to Citi Field, with plans including a casino and hotel, 5 acres of green space, playgrounds, a 5,000-seat indoor music venue, a rebuilt transit hub, and a locally inspired food hall, among other amenities.

This last and final regulatory decision was widely expected after the gaming commission’s facility location board formally and unanimously recommended the Metropolitan Park project, along with two other proposals, on Dec. 1.

That board holds significant sway on the final decision, and indeed, the gaming licenses were formally granted to Metropolitan Park, along with Bally’s, which plans a $4 billion resort complex at Ferry Point in the Bronx, and to Resorts World New York City, which proposes to build at the site of the Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens.

More directly, though, the Metropolitan Park project aims to convert a sea of asphalt surrounding the Mets’ home ballpark with something far more impactful and vibrant. Cohen, Hard Rock, and their partners have been in active pursuit of the gaming license for several years.

“Since the day I bought the team, the community and Mets fans have made it clear to me that we can and should do better with the area around the ballpark,” Cohen said. “Now, we are going to be able to deliver the sports and entertainment district that our fans have been asking for.”

Construction is expected to begin early next year in anticipation of a June 2030 opening.

Each of the three recipients of the gaming licenses will need to pay an upfront licensing fee of $500 million, commit to another $500 million in capital improvements, and pay annual taxes on the gaming revenue.

Scotland is in the midst of “World Cup fever” after claiming its first berth to the tournament since 1998, and following FIFA’s recent event draw, the country knows its men’s team will start group play in June against Haiti. The Scottish national team, however, has a stark warning for fans: Don’t overextend yourself financially to see us.

In the wake of World Cup ticket prices that soared roughly fivefold compared to the 2022 tournament in Qatar, Scotland team manager Steve Clarke implored fans to watch their wallets as they consider traveling to North America for matches.

“One of my biggest wishes is that people don’t put themselves too much into debt trying to buy tickets,” Clarke said. “Even the cheapest ones look to be pretty pricey.”

FIFA said Scotland is one of the top countries making ticket requests for the upcoming World Cup, beyond the host countries of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico—further signifying the upstart nature of the country’s appearance amid global powers such as neighboring England, 2022 World Cup winner Argentina, France, Brazil, and Germany.

Football Supporters Europe, however, estimated it would cost at least $6,900 for a single fan to follow their team from the start of group-stage play to the final. That fan advocacy group, along with many others around the world, has decried what they describe as “extortionate” practices by FIFA. Compounding the sticker shock is FIFA’s use of dynamic prices for much of its World Cup ticketing.

“Some of the figures are eye-watering, if you look at them,” Clarke said.

Clarke’s comments followed those of Scottish fan group the Association of Tartan Army Clubs, which said that “FIFA has killed the dream of our young fans, desperate to get to a World Cup.”

Robust Demand

Despite the continued global pushback on FIFA’s World Cup ticket pricing, sales continue to be strong. The governing body said it received 5 million ticket requests during its third phase of ticket sales, adding to the nearly 2 million tickets sold during the two prior phases.

For Scotland specifically, the Scottish Football Association has claimed the maximum ticket allocation it can for its matches, amounting to 8% of the available inventory, and it will be distributing those tickets to its member supporter groups. That 8% allocation matches what is happening for all 48 participating countries.

“Tickets are going to be tight,” Clarke said. “The Scottish FA have taken the full allocation. I’m sure it’ll be used.”

With three games left in the 2025 NFL regular season, the Jaguars have already matched their highest win total since 2017, as the franchise rolls toward a likely playoff berth after high-priced leadership changes this offseason.

Jacksonville blew out the Jets 48–20 on Sunday to improve to 10–4 this season, and retain a one-game lead over the Texans in the AFC South. That guarantees the Jaguars their first double-digit win total since 2017, when they went 10–6 and reached the AFC championship game. Before that, the team’s previous best record was an 11–5 mark in 2007.

The improved play on the field comes following a major overhaul of the front office and coaching staff after missing the playoffs the previous two seasons.

First-year head coach Liam Coen is also Jacksonville’s offensive play-caller; he signed a five-year contract in January worth an estimated $12 million annually after turning down an offer to remain with the Buccaneers as the highest-paid offensive coordinator in the NFL.

The pursuit of Coen led the Jaguars to also fire former GM Trent Baalke, who owner Shad Khan originally intended to keep in place despite moving on from former coach Doug Pederson.

Jacksonville then hired former Rams executive James Gladstone, 35, making him the youngest GM in the NFL (and second youngest in league history when he was hired at 34). To complement the youth strategy, the Jaguars also brought in franchise legend Tony Boselli, the team’s only Pro Football Hall of Famer, to serve in the newly created role of EVP of football operations.

The new-look front office made an aggressive move in the 2025 NFL Draft to trade up to the No. 2 pick to select two-way star and Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter, who sustained a season-ending knee injury in October. Despite that injury, Jacksonville has found success under quarterback Trevor Lawrence, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 draft, whose five-year, $275 million contract extension kicks in next year.

Home Field Advantage?

Any potential postseason run will come as the Jaguars prepare for extensive renovations at EverBank Stadium that will lower the venue’s capacity in 2026 and reportedly see the team play home games in Orlando in 2027.

The project is expected to cost $1.4 billion and add a roof to the facility, which originally opened in 1995, and underwent a major renovation in 2003 and 2004 that led to Jacksonville hosting Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005.",https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/USATSI_27817753_168416383_lowres-scaled-e1765825592531.jpg?quality=100,N,,2025-12-15 22:59:49.885221

""I mean, it was dark for me at first,"" said McMillan, speaking publicly for the first time since sustaining the injury Aug. 16.
McMillan had to wear a neck brace morning and night -- even while sleeping -- for 3½ months, only taking it off to bathe.
""You want to learn something every day,"" McMillan said.
For weeks and weeks, it was the stair climber and the Peloton bike, before he could even think about running.","TAMPA, Fla. -- Buccaneers wide receiver Jalen McMillan, who returned last week for the first time since suffering three fractured vertebrae in his neck, said Monday that his doctor told him he was almost paralyzed.

""I mean, it was dark for me at first,"" said McMillan, speaking publicly for the first time since sustaining the injury Aug. 16. ""First I felt good and I thought it was just a minor injury and then the doctor said I almost got paralyzed, so it kind of scared me a little bit. And then there was doubt too because I didn't know if I was going to be playing again.""

It happened in the second preseason game at the Pittsburgh Steelers. McMillan leapt up to catch a pass from backup quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and fell awkwardly on the back of his head with his body folded in half. He was able to somehow walk off the field under his own power. He even joked with teammate Sterling Shepard. But that didn't reveal the full extent of his injuries, which coach Todd Bowles originally described as a ""severe neck sprain.""

McMillan had to wear a neck brace morning and night -- even while sleeping -- for 3½ months, only taking it off to bathe. He needed help to perform basic tasks for himself, which went against his natural inclination to be self-sufficient, but he learned to lean on his support system. When he was able to finally leave the house, the stares from people made him uncomfortable.

""I kept having to try to wake up with a positive attitude. At first, I didn't for like a week, two weeks, and I was just sad and depressed,"" said McMillan, whose family lives in California. ""But then the mode switched, I was to wake up, do positive things, find small wins, celebrate small wins throughout the day. It took a lot. And just to get back to that moment, and to just vision and just to see what I could potentially do if I come back -- that's what I was thriving off of and just kept motivating myself off of.""

""It's about embracing your journey really,"" McMillan said. ""It sucked for me because people would tell me like, 'Oh, you're going to be back. Don't worry, you'll be fine.' But then again, in the back of my head it's like, 'I'm not sure if I'll be back, but I'm going to try to approach every day as if I am.' So it just took everything in me. It took waking up reading, finding new hobbies of mine, trying to explore different aspects of my life just so I could try to level up outside of football.""

He went to a bookstore daily to read a new book. His favorites? ""Billy Summers"" by Stephen King, and ""Dark Matter,"" by Blake Crouch. He also took up chess but didn't take too kindly to teammate Mike Evans beating him, so he switched to learning how to cook. And his family came to visit him when they could, doing activities like sunset boat rides.

""You want to learn something every day,"" McMillan said. ""That's what I try to do just to feel brand-new when it came to just waking up, not sitting in my depressed mood, not being sad.""

For weeks and weeks, it was the stair climber and the Peloton bike, before he could even think about running. Then he was cleared to return to practice Dec. 3, along with Evans, who sustained a broken collarbone in Week 7. Both players were activated off of injured reserve Dec. 10.

""When they cleared me, I was really, really emotional,"" McMillan said. ""But during the game, I had seen the vision so many times that the ball -- just seeing the ball came natural just because I dreamed of it back. It feels normal. It felt like I didn't really miss a beat, just my head being in football and just every day being consistent in practice habits, I kind of approached every week like that as if I were playing so that when I came back it didn't feel different or alien.""

In his first catch, he hauled in a 19-yard reception going across the field, which was initially ruled a touchdown before officials overturned it and determined he was down at the 1-yard line. But it set up a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Sean Tucker.

""I wanted it to be known that I'm still the same guy and I didn't really change. If anything, I got better and I'm back now,"" the 2024 third-round draft pick said.

Shepard said it speaks to McMillan's mental strength.

""You go through an injury like that, a lot of times, guys will come back and be hesitant to do things,"" Shepard said. ""J-Mac picked up right where he left off and was able to go in there and make big plays for us the two times that he got the ball. We look forward to seeing what else he's able to do and how he's able to help this offense.""

McMillan said he trusted his doctors when they told him he was fine, and he gained even more trust in his body after his first time going over the middle, which is a vulnerable place for receivers. Still, he recognizes his extraordinarily good fortune, and that things could have been much different. And for that, he's grateful.

""[The doctor] said, 'I have God on my side.' I'm just blessed,"" McMillan said. ""I grew as a person, and I'm just honored to play this game. I want to give everything to this game.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1215%2Fr1589797_1024x576_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 22:59:54.452348

A 49ers win in Week 16 vs. the Bears would also mean no other NFC team can get to 13 wins.","You wouldn't think the Super Bowl race could get any more wide open than it already was … then Week 15 happened.

The Chiefs and Bengals were both eliminated, meaning the AFC won't have to go through Patrick Mahomes or Joe Burrow. That was looking like a formality but I'm sure the rest of the conference is still relieved and believing that anyone can make the Super Bowl now.

Then, just when it looked like two teams (Rams and Packers) were starting to separate themselves in the NFC, they lose two of their star players. Micah Parsons' season is over with a torn ACL, while Davante Adams aggravated a hamstring injury that puts his status in doubt for a crucial matchup vs. the Seahawks on Thursday that could ultimately decide the No. 1 seed in the NFC.

Rams still the favorite, but NFC just got really interesting

I still like the Rams to win the NFC but if anything was going to throw them off it'd be an injury to one of their stars on offense. Adams' injury doesn't look to be season ending and he was optimistic after the game, but the severity is still unknown. Even missing one game could be detrimental to the Rams' Super Bowl hopes, and it's hard to imagine him being ready on a short week after how he went down on Sunday.

The Rams face the Seahawks on Thursday in Seattle and the winner of that game will be in the driver's seat for the top seed in the NFC. The Rams may have beaten the Seahawks earlier this season, but Adams scored a touchdown in that game and they only won by two despite Sam Darnold's horrific four-interception performance.

Adams may not be a WR1 anymore but he's helped elevate Matthew Stafford to an MVP level and he's been a major nightmare for opposing defenses in the red zone. The Rams lead the NFL in offensive efficiency (+8.4 offensive EPA per game) and are third in the NFL in red zone touchdown percentage this season (67%) after ranking 13th and 25th, respectively, in those categories last season.

Adams deserves a lot of credit. He has 11 touchdown catches since Week 7, and nine of them have been on plays inside the opponent's five yard line. He's caught nine of 12 targets for nine touchdowns inside the five in that span. Somehow Stafford to Adams has become as reliable as the Tush Push in short-yardage spots. No other NFL player has more than four catches in that area since Week 7.

With Stafford's ball placement and Adam's combination of size and footwork he's helped the Rams cash in on their scoring opportunities. He put Riq Woolen on skates with this slant route for a 1-yard score vs. Seattle earlier this year.

He caught a fade here vs. the Buccaneers. Adams' nine touchdowns in goal-to-go situations are only surpassed by one other player since 2000. It was Adams in 2020 when he had 12.

While Adams could miss an extended period of time and the injury is obviously not ideal, there's several reasons to believe they could weather the storm. The Rams beat the Jaguars 35-7 in Week 7, their only game without Puka Nacua this season. They are extremely balanced and the only team that ranks top five in the NFL in offensive and defensive efficiency.

The Rams have used 13 personnel (one running, three tight ends) more than twice as much as any other team in the NFL since Nacua was hurt in Week 7 (41%). The recent switch to this personnel is another reason to believe they can manage without Adams for now. The Rams are averaging an NFL-high 35.0 PPG since they started using this heavy personnel in Week 7. They are still averaging a ridiculous 6.3 yards per play in those groups. They rank second in the NFL pass success rate (63%) and rush success rate (50%) vs. base defenses in that span so that personnel is allowing Stafford to pick apart mismatches while they are still running the ball effectively.

The Rams run game looks poised to carry more of that burden, too. They rank top four in the NFL in rushing (186.7 yards per game) and yards per rush (6.5) in the past three weeks with the emergence of Blake Corum in the backfield with Kyren Williams. They are the only duo in at least the last 90 seasons with 70+ rushing yards and a rushing touchdown a piece in three straight games.

Of course, the door is more open for almost everyone else in the NFC should this slow the Rams down. The Seahawks are the biggest beneficiary. They control their own destiny in the NFC and they'll take any edge they can get when they host the Rams in three days.

The Eagles, Bears and 49ers have to feel like they have a chance, too.

NFL Week 15 overreactions: Micah Parsons injury ends Packers' Super Bowl hopes? Josh Allen for MVP?

Tyler Sullivan

Parsons injury crushes Packers' Super Bowl hopes; NFC North up for grabs

Those teams all benefit from the Packers' misfortune, too. I would argue they were the second best team in the NFC, until they weren't. Everything was looking up for the Packers midway through Sunday's game until all of the air came out of the balloon and a potential dream season turned to a nightmare.

The Packers were up 23-14 in the third quarter when Jordan Love's interception cost Green Bay the ball and his top weapon as Christian Watson left the game with a chest injury and did not return. Later in the quarter Parsons suffered his season-ending torn ACL. The Packers got dominated the rest of the way and fell from the No. 2 seed to the No. 7 seed in the NFC. They were on the verge of beating a playoff-caliber team in three straight games (Lions, Bears, Broncos) and looking like they had as good of a case as anyone to win Super Bowl LX.

Now, Green Bay looks destined to go one-and-done again. This was a team that was 0-7 vs. 11+ win teams in 2024 when they did not have Parsons. They made him the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history and traded two first-round picks for the generational talent to put them over the top in the postseason and in games like Sunday's. Then, in the blink of an eye, those hopes evaporated. You could argue they could bounce back from this. The 49ers have grinded out wins without Nick Bosa and Fred Warner, after all. That's also a highly motivated team coming off a Super Bowl hangover season with an easy schedule. The 49ers have also gone from 13th to last in the NFL in pressure rate since Bosa's injury. I don't see how the Packers rebound from this crushing loss in the stretch run of the season.

That's the task though and they'll barely have time to lick their wounds as they play the Bears at Soldier Field on Saturday night with the NFC North on the line. The Bears now have the edge in the division given these injuries and how they just played the Packers in Green Bay. Parsons may have gotten off a slow start with the Packers after his contract dispute with Dallas and a back injury this offseason but he was still having a dominant season. He became the first player in NFL history with 12+ sacks in each of his first five seasons. He ranks second in the NFL in pressure rate this year (20%) and he led the NFL in that category since Week 10 (23%), which included a game with seven pressures vs. the Bears in Week 14. His absence could help put Chicago over the top. Caleb Williams has the lowest completion percentage (38%) in the NFL vs. pressure this season. Just as the Cowboys defense has struggled all season without Parsons, it's hard to imagine Green Bay won't take a step back here, too.

Don't overlook Watson's injury, either. The Packers reportedly got some good news on his injury but it's unclear whether he will miss time. His reemergence elevated Green Bay to a top-flight offense as he ranked sixth in the NFL in yards per route (2.64) in the past five weeks behind Nacua, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, CeeDee Lamb, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Nico Collins (minimum 100 routes). He's added an element of explosiveness back into the passing game evidenced by two touchdowns vs. the Bears in Week 14. All of a sudden, Green Bay could be without two of its most important players in a game that will probably decide the division in Week 16.

The 49ers have a path to the one seed in the NFC

The biggest winner in the NFC besides the Seahawks is the 49ers. Besides finally having another NFC contender share in their injury misery, San Francisco's surprising path to the top seed in the NFC just got intriguing. The 49ers are 10-4 and will be the top seed in the conference if they win out and the Seahawks beat the Rams on Thursday.

The 49ers final three games are at the Colts and then at home vs. the Bears and Seahawks. If they win out they'll finish the year 13-4 with a 5-1 division record, including 3-1 vs. the Rams and Seahawks. That would give them any tiebreaker over their NFC West rivals if Seattle beats Los Angeles on Thursday. A 49ers win in Week 16 vs. the Bears would also mean no other NFC team can get to 13 wins.

The 49ers have been flying under the radar all season as they've played the second-easiest schedule in the NFC (only the Bears is easier). I've written them of myself after Brock Purdy threw three interceptions on Monday night vs. the Panthers. Especially since they already have a defense that's last in the NFL in sacks and without Bosa and Warner. But, this is a very well coached team with Robert Saleh back in the fold and Christian McCaffrey is having a spectacular season. If they can beat the odds and steal the top seed after Rams and Packers losses, who's to say they couldn't ride home-field advantage to Super Bowl LX, which will be at their home stadium.

That would be an incredible story that went from impossible to improbable after these injuries. There's also speculation that Warner could be aiming to make a return should the 49ers make a deep playoff run, although that still seems unlikely.

“He lost the game in heartbreaking fashion, and then did not win a playoff game — one game — the next three years.","There is no bigger Chiefs fan among the national TV sports talk-show hosts than Nick Wright.

After the Chiefs’ playoff hopes were extinguished in a 16-13 loss to the Chargers, Wright wrote in an X post about KC’s dynastic run.

“It’s been a totally surreal 7 year run,” Wright wrote. “5 Super Bowl trips, 3 Rings, played in the Conference Championship game every single year. Everything caught up with them this year & they just didn’t have it. No shame in that, just is what it is. Now we just pray Patrick is OK.”

Unfortunately for the Chiefs, quarterback Patrick Mahomes is not OK. He has a torn ACL in his left knee and will miss the rest of the season.

Mahomes’ ninth season will end with him watching the Chiefs missing the playoffs. In an odd coincidence, NFL legend Tom Brady suffered a torn ACL in his knee during his ninth season. That came in the Patriots’ opener, which was against the Chiefs.

New England missed the playoffs that season.

But the career trajectories of Mahomes and Brady aren’t similar just because of the knee injury.

Wright had talked with Bill Simmons about the parallel trajectory of the careers of Brady and Mahomes in a podcast episode that was released Thursday.

“Some very odd and scary, for me at least, similarities. Tom Brady in his seventh year as a starter, stepped on the field in the Super Bowl, trying to win his fourth ring, knowing if we win this game, I am considered the undisputed goat, and this is considered the greatest team of all-time,” Wright said. “He lost the game in heartbreaking fashion, and then did not win a playoff game — one game — the next three years. Now, first year of that was tragic, Week 1, he gets his knee blown out ...

“Patrick in year seven, was playing for ring four, trying to become the undisputed greatest team ever if they pull off the three-peat, they lose that Super Bowl in very different fashion. He doesn’t get hurt the next year, but it looks like they’re going to be out of the tournament in year eight, and that scares me.”

Wright couldn’t have guessed that Mahomes would face a similar injury to Brady, who missed nearly the entire 2008 season. But that’s what happened just days after Wright talked about the Mahomes-Brady connection.

That strange connection between the careers of Mahomes and Brady wasn’t only noted by Wright. Others on social media made similar comparisons.

He provided several key injury updates.

Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall aggravated his PCL injury and is also dealing with an ankle injury. His practice availability this week remains unclear.

Left guard Spencer Burford received encouraging test results after suffering an ankle injury against the Titans. Shanahan confirmed it was not a high-ankle sprain, and Burford is expected to return to practice this week.

Linebacker Nick Martin remains in the NFL concussion protocol.

What's the 49ers' level of concern with Pearsall's injury?

""There is a concern, I think, just seeing kind of how those have gone this year,"" Shanahan admitted. ""The ankle, it was a tough ankle injury, but it checked out. That it wasn't a high and he was able to get through the game is somewhat encouraging. That shouldn't rule him out for this week. But that combined with the knee, I mean, he aggravated it, which is something.""

Shanahan noted that Pearsall landed on his knee, causing some pain and lasting discomfort.

""So, hopefully, it's not at all like it was when he first did it, but it does take time for that pain to go away, and hopefully, that'll be sooner than later over these next eight days,"" Shanahan added.

Other injury updates

Shanahan also said the 49ers expect several players to return to practice this week, including defensive end Sam Okuayinonu (ankle), defensive tackle Jordan Elliott (knee), and linebackers Tatum Bethune (ankle) and Eric Kendricks (calf). Okuayinonu, Elliott, and Bethune were inactive against the Titans, while Kendricks has been sidelined with calf tightness.

Shanahan was asked if Kendricks has a chance to be elevated from the practice squad and contribute in the game against the Indianapolis Colts.

""Yeah, if he was totally healthy,"" Shanahan said. ""But that's with all of them. Same with Tatum, coming back from his high-ankle, we're not sure how they're going to look. So we'll get him in there, see how it goes. We should get two full-speed practices in, which should give us a good idea.

""But we've been short these last couple of weeks, especially losing these guys, with Nick Martin. That's why we had to take guys off other teams to get them up last week. So, they've got to get back into practice first, show us where they're at and stuff, and how it's going. And that'll give us a chance to make some decisions ... come Saturday.""

Like the Chiefs, the Packers are one of the most popular NFL teams, including among TV viewers, and the loss of Parsons could impact viewership for the rest of the season. The Packers, however, remain in the mix for the 2025 playoffs, unlike Kansas City, which was eliminated on Sunday. Green Bay, with a 9-4-1 record, currently holds the final playoff slot in the National Football Conference and still has an 88% probability of reaching the postseason.

“I may be sidelined, but I am not defeated,” Parsons said in a social media post. “I will rise again.”

The injury to Adams is not as severe as Parsons’s and Mahomes’s, but the Rams are the first NFC team to clinch a playoff spot and have serious aspirations of a return to the Super Bowl.

Trade Factors

The Packers acquired Parsons just before the start of the regular season in a blockbuster trade with the Cowboys. After that deal, Parsons signed a four-year, $188 million contract with Green Bay, including $136 million in guaranteed money and representing the type of deal he unsuccessfully sought from Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.

The pact is the largest for a non-quarterback in league history.

The 12.5 sacks that Parsons registered this season are tied for third in the league, and beyond that statistic, he has been a fixture in a Green Bay defense that ranks sixth in the NFL—showing the immediate payoff from the deal.",https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/USATSI_27817753_168416383_lowres-scaled-e1765825592531.jpg?quality=100,N,,2025-12-16 01:59:18.027039

Chargers played dirty, and bad officiating encouraged dirty play.

2. Pat’s injury was unrelated to the dirty play.

That said, if his injury starts a conversation on how bad officiating is encouraging dirty play, I’d be ok with that. Refs really need to do better.

The NFL is and has been actively proving they don’t favor the Chiefs by ignoring most penalties against them the whole season.

Nothing is going to change. They have a point to prove and they’re going to stick to it.

People thought this was due to a dirty play? News to me.

The only dirty mother fucker, Jefferson, got ejected earlier in the game. We don't need a Burfict 2.0 in the league. Dude's bad for the NFL.

The contact on that play had nothing to do with Mahomes’ injury and it wasn’t “dirty” either. Anyone who thinks it was a dirty play either really needs to go and rewatch the play or get a grip.

That said, Chargers were out there looking to cause some pain. Was pretty surprised by Jefferson’s ejection, but he was running around like a missile out there, and guessing the refs were telling him to slow it down a bit beforehand hit on Thornton.

I actually do think that was a dirty play by the defender. I get all the ""he's just playing hard, it's part of the game"" arguments. The fact is the dude dove at Patrick's legs after the ball was out of his hand. That's a dirty play.

i'm guessing dude wrote a whole article off of ONE tweet. Because nowhere in my mind did i think that specific play was dirty.

With that said...other plays in that game were dirty and i do think the refs sort of gave the Chargers a greenlight to light our receivers up. Then eventually when Thornton got laid out, the refs had to kind of clean up their own mistakes and eject that player.

Never see our players do shit when Mahomes takes a late hit. Every other teams OL gets in the opposing players ass immediately following a play. This team of players doesn’t protect Patrick. They just allow teams to tee off on him and half the time it’s the OL’s absolute shit blocking that causes the biggest hits. Andy is too lenient with the players. And it shows in the penalties and discipline the last two seasons.",,N,,2025-12-15 21:00:16.842096

Joey Bosa, DE, hamstring

Joey Bosa returned from a one-game absence in Week 15 against the Patriots. He didn't record a tackle but deflected a fourth-down pass with less than two minutes left to help seal the win.

Bosa suffered a hamstring injury on a pass rush and exited the game against the Steelers in Week 14.

Bosa leads the Bills with five sacks and five forced fumbles, which ties a single-season franchise record.

Joshua Palmer, WR, ankle

The rookie third-round pick came off the left edge on a run by Ollie Gordon and fought off a block before falling backward. He immediately brought his right knee to his chest and grabbed it in pain and trainers evaluated him on the field.

Jackson was ruled out for the game shortly after. He returned to the Bills sideline in the second half with a brace on his right knee and using crutches.

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Dec. 5 that Jackson is out for the rest of the season.

Oliver, who had a sack on the first possession of the game, went into the medical tent and FOX cameras showed him speaking with trainers and pointing to his left arm. He returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling under his hooded sweatshirt.

Oliver is tied for the team lead with three sacks despite only plying in three of the Bills' seven games.

He waved off the cart that drove into the field to take him to the locker room. Instead, Hoecht hobbled off with the help of trainers and stayed on the bench with his teammates for the rest of the game.

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

""It's a big loss,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. “I feel terrible for him.”

Tyler Bass, K, left hip/groin

Tyler Bass was placed on injured reserve on Friday, Sept. 5 after he was unable to practice the day prior. Bass missed most of training camp with pelvic soreness, sitting out from July 28 to Aug. 19 before returning for the preseason finale. He went 3-for-4 in that game, connecting from 37, 37 and 39 yards before pushing a 26-yarder wide right.

Bass was eligible to return in Week 5 against the New England Patriots but has not had his 21-day practice window opened.

New Orleans linebacker Nephi Sewell crashed into Johnston’s left leg and was flagged for a roughing the kicker penalty. Johnston, 33, immediately slammed his helmet to the turf in frustration before hobbling off with trainers.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead. He walked to the X-ray room after the game.

Johnston was carted off the field with a season-ending right knee injury in Week 1 last season after taking a low shot while playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Packers are still in the hunt for the NFC North, and even if the Bears end up nabbing the division title, Green Bay is still in the mix for a wild card spot at 9-4-1. Unfortunately, they’ll likely have to go on that run without their top defender, Micah Parsons. The former Cowboys defender was closing in on Broncos Bo Nix when he suffered a non-contact knee injury and immediately fell to the ground. Initial concerns were that Parsons tore his ACL, and that turned out to be the base, and will keep him out for a long time.

Parson’s teammates stayed positive after their Week 15 loss to the Broncos, and said they still feel confident that the team has all the pieces for a Super Bowl run.

One of the league’s top edge rushers wasn’t the only one with a crushing injury, Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL just minutes before Kansas City was officially eliminated from playoff contention. It will be the first time in Mahomes career that he’ll miss the postseason, and now he has a long recovery ahead of him while he and the organization figure out what’s next for a dying dynasty.

Additional testing is still needed, but Ravens LB Teddye Buchanan, the team’s second-leading tackler, is also thought to have torn his ACL, and Rams WR Davante Adams suffered what is being called a significant hamstring injury.

It’s late in the season, and football is a sport in which players get injured at any point, but as the playoffs approach, the injuries are certainly more impactful.

On the season, the Browns allow 110.1 rushing yards per game – the 14th-fewest rushing yards in the NFL.
Cleveland has allowed 131.3 rushing yards per game since Week 10.","""That ballgame is disappointing to start that way,"" Stefanski said. ""We have to own that and watch the tape and look at it and learn from it and find a way to correct some of those things that happened early in the game so you can be in that game and give yourself a chance to win that game.""

""Just the guys who are available come Sunday, we go to battle with them, and we work really hard during the week to make sure we have contingency plans and guys are ready to go, backups stay ready,"" Stefanski said.

Sanders managed to still make the throw and allowed Bond to run under the ball and gain 49 yards on the play. According to Stefanski, Sanders is going to face challenges every week in his NFL career.

""Sometimes there are moments that aren't going to go your way, and you learn from those,"" Stefanski said. ""So that's no different for any position, no different for Shedeur versus any other player. There's going to be really good games. There are going to be games you want back. There's going to be plays you want back, great plays. So, I look at it for a young player to be able to go into a really tough spot, have some really good moments, some moments that you want back. We'll learn from those, we'll grow from those, and we'll be better from those.""

The last time the Browns allowed consecutive 100-plus rushing yard games this season was in Week 10 against the Jets and Week 11 against the Ravens. On the season, the Browns allow 110.1 rushing yards per game – the 14th-fewest rushing yards in the NFL. Cleveland has allowed 131.3 rushing yards per game since Week 10. The Browns gave up just 94.3 rushing yards per game in the eight games before Week 10, playing tight defense against the run.

""Stopping the run is just really about physicality, coming and setting the edges and tackling,"" LB Mohamoud Diabate said. ""I think over the year as a whole, we've done a good job of doing that. We just have to get back to that recipe.""

Cleveland also has been searching for ways to limit the kick and punt return yards it has allowed. The Browns have allowed three special teams touchdowns this season and gave a blocked punt in Week 14 against the Titans. On Chicago's opening kickoff return in Week 15, Bears WR Devin Duvernay returned the kick 52 yards to the Browns' side of the field.

""We have to do a better job as a unit of getting off of blocks and finishing the ball carrier when we're down, when we're around the ball carrier,"" Diabate said. ""It's not too complicated of a play.

Luckily for Pittsburgh, they’ll have their starting running back available.

Starter Jaylen Warren was added to the injury report Monday morning and downgraded to ""questionable"" after waking up with an illness, the team announced.

NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported that Warren would receive fluids and was optimistic he'd play, and now, he’s officially active for the primetime contest. Warren’s averaging a career-best 77.4 scrimmage yards per game in his first year as the team’s full-time starter following the departure of Najee Harris in the offseason. Should he be limited in any capacity, Kenneth Gainwell should see an increase in work, quietly having a career year with the black and gold as a complement to Warren.

The rest of Week 15 was headlined by injuries to star players, comebacks, and clarity on playoff positioning. Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes left Sunday's 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers with a torn ACL, and his team was eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in his career.

On the NFC side, Green Bay Packers trade acquisition Micah Parsons suffered what is feared to be a torn ACL in Sunday's 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos. Parsons has totaled 12.5 sacks, 12 tackles for loss and a forced fumble in his first season with the Packers.

The Bills and Rams both had second-half comebacks on the road, both of which could have massive playoff implications down the line. The Bills' 21-point comeback gave them a 35-31 win over the Patriots, ending New England’s 10-game winning streak and a 120-game winning streak when leading by 17+ points at home. The Rams cut a 10-point deficit to beat the Lions 41-34.

The playoff chances for the Lions, Panthers and Colts took a huge hit after each suffered tough losses on Sunday. The Lions stumbled in the second half against the Rams in Jared Goff's return to LA, while the Panthers were stunned by the Saints. Forty-four-year-old Philip Rivers' return after a five-year absence was spoiled when a costly interception sealed a win for the Seahawks.

The Rams and Broncos both clinched their spots in the playoffs with their respective wins on Sunday, currently sitting as the No. 1 seeds in the NFC and AFC, respectively.

The Washington Commanders will shut down the quarterback for the rest of the 2025 season, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Monday, per sources informed of the situation.

Rapoport added that Daniels was re-evaluated on Monday and is not yet cleared after he aggravated an elbow injury in Week 14.

Commanders head coach Dan Quinn later confirmed that Daniels will miss the final three games, adding the decision to shut him down was ""part medical, part team."" Quinn told reporters, however, that Daniels would continue to participate in practice this year.

The 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year has suffered through an injury-riddled second season.

Daniels suffered a knee sprain in Week 2, forcing him to miss two contests. He returned in Week 5 but made it through just two tilts before a hamstring strain in Week 7 caused him to miss one game.

The QB returned in Week 9 and suffered a gruesome elbow injury late in a blowout loss. Daniels missed three tilts with the elbow injury. In Week 14, he exited early in a shutout loss after falling on his elbow after an interception. Daniels did not play in the Commanders' 29-21 win on Sunday against the New York Giants.

There will be no fourth return in 2025.

After a sensational 12-5 rookie campaign, Daniels saw his numbers fall across the board, even when on the field.

He completed 60.9 percent of his passes for 1,262 yards with eight touchdowns and three interceptions in seven games. The quarterback added 58 rush attempts for 278 yards and two scores. The Commanders went 2-5 in Daniels' seven starts.

The decision to shut down Daniels makes sense for a Washington club that was eliminated from postseason contention earlier this month.

The hope is that the rest will allow the dynamic QB to get fully healthy heading into the 2026 campaign.

Marcus Mariota, who started Sunday's win, which broke an eight-game losing skid, will remain the starter. Veteran Josh Johnson is also on the roster, with Sam Hartman on the practice squad.

During the New York Giants' 29–21 loss to the Washington Commanders, the rookie quarterback left the game early in the fourth quarter to be examined under the NFL's concussion protocol. He missed two snaps before being cleared to return to action.

It marked the fifth time in just 10 games (including preseason) that Dart has been checked for a possible concussion.

After the game, Dart made it clear he didn't think the evaluation was necessary. ""Definitely feel there is a sensitivity for some reason,"" he said.

On the play in question, the Giants had first-and-goal from the 1-yard line when Dart faked a pitch and ran straight up the middle, where he was sandwiched by Commanders defensive linemen Eddie Goldman and Javon Kinlaw. His neck bent awkwardly on contact, and officials immediately signaled for the Giants' medical staff.

""Definitely wasn't the first time I was surprised I had to come out,"" he said. ""But I was definitely surprised. It didn't feel like it was that big of a hit at all.""

While it's easy to understand why a quarterback would be frustrated about being removed from the game — especially in a red zone situation — the league has good reason to be abundantly cautious.

The NFL has faced intense scrutiny in recent years over how it handles head injuries, particularly after high-profile concussion situations involving Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Those incidents sparked league-wide backlash, protocol changes and renewed pressure on teams and officials to err on the side of caution.

Dart himself missed two games earlier this season after suffering a concussion against the Chicago Bears.

Whether Dart agrees with every evaluation or not, he's at risk if he keeps taking heavy contact, and learning to better protect himself has to be a priority. Lest he become another cautionary tale.

In the aftermath of a 34-26 loss to the Denver Broncos, Rashan Gary immediately went to check on his fellow defensive linemen after Parsons suffered a non-contact knee injury late in the third quarter at Empower Field at Mile High Stadium.

The disappointment of the defeat paled in comparison to Parsons' departure. When first asked about Parsons' injury, Gary paused for 12 seconds while holding back emotions.

""When I came in, I told him to keep his head up and we're gonna finish strong for him,"" Gary said. ""That's what I told him. I'm gonna keep in contact with him throughout what he's doing. That was my first message to him. It hurt. It hurt.""

Acquired in a blockbuster trade back with Dallas in August, Parsons has had an immeasurable impact on defense since his arrival.

Heading into Sunday's game, Parsons was in the conversation for NFL Defensive Player of the Year with 39 tackles, 26 quarterback hits and 12½ sacks in 13 games.

Everything came to a crashing halt with the Packers clinging to a 23-21 lead late in the third quarter. Parsons had just disengaged with right tackle Mike McGlinchey in pursuit of Broncos quarterback Bo Nix when he awkwardly planted his foot and fell to the ground.

Parsons went immediately to the locker room and was ruled out of the game in the fourth quarter. Asked whether the team fears an ACL tear, Head Coach Matt LaFleur told reporters after the game: ""It doesn't look good.""

""Obviously it sucks when anybody gets injured,"" safety Xavier McKinney said. ""It's a big loss for our defense, for our team, but the next guy got to step up, so, it is what it is, but I'm praying that … it's not like too, too crazy.""

Parsons was in midst of yet another strong game. He had two tackles, drew a holding penalty, deflected a pass and forced a fumble in the first quarter that Edgerrin Cooper recovered, resulting in a 53-yard Brandon McManus field goal that put Green Bay on the board.

The Packers led 23-14 early in the third quarter before things quickly unraveled, beginning with Patrick Surtain's interception of Jordan Love on a deep ball on first down. Christian Watson, the intended target, left the game with a chest injury and didn't return.

Denver's second-year quarterback Bo Nix kept building momentum throughout the second half and drove the Broncos into Packers' territory, completing an 11-yard pass to Marvin Mims on the same play Parsons was injured.

Denver pulled ahead, 27-23, three plays after Parsons' exit on a 23-yard touchdown pass to Troy Franklin. Green Bay never led again in the game.

Nix completed 23 of 34 passes for 304 yards and four touchdowns (134.7 passer rating) while the Broncos went 4-for-4 in the red zone compared to Green Bay's 1-for-4.

""Obviously, we probably wish we could've gotten some plays back … but at the end of the day, that's a good team,"" McKinney said. ""They've got good coaches and we'll run into them again. They're on the other side obviously but hopefully we see them in the Super Bowl, but just keep going, keep fighting and it's not over yet.""

There's obvious disappointment that accompanies Parsons' injury, but both McKinney and Gary acknowledge this remains a Green Bay defense that had lofty goals even before trading for the four-time Pro Bowl pass rusher.

The Packers also got 2023 first-round pick Lukas Van Ness back from a foot injury on Sunday while Brenton Cox Jr. nears a return from the groin injury that sidelined him since September.

After talking with Parsons, Gary said he pulled the defense together and to remind the unit what would be required for one of the NFL's top defenses to overcome the potential loss of one of the league's best players.

As much as the potential loss of Parsons hurts, Green Bay has a key NFC North matchup in six days against the Chicago Bears, who jumped back atop the division with a dominant win over Cleveland on Sunday.

""For the rest of the season, what we got? Three more opportunities? Watch how the front play,"" Gary said. ""We had a meeting at the end, brought all the guys up, understanding that there's gonna be a lot of opportunities the next three weeks and we gotta take advantage of it, so you gonna see how we play.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/napflsww5ojyutt0zfuz,N,,2025-12-15 22:01:59.689350

NFL Week 15 Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs

Patrick Mahomes unfortunately suffered a torn ACL this weekend, ending his season and putting the start of the 2026 season in doubt. Kansas City was also eliminated from playoff contention. This is a huge hit, as Mahomes returned to being an elite fantasy asset in 2025.

Geno Smith, Las Vegas Raiders

Pete Carroll declined to give any major update on Smith on Monday, leading me to believe it’s more likely than not that he’s inactive this weekend against the Texans. Practice reports will likely tell most of the story here, but I’m expecting Kenny Pickett to get another start.

Jayden Daniels, Washington Commanders

Dan Quinn confirmed today that Daniels will be shut down for the remainder of the season. Daniels had a tough sophomore campaign in the NFL, and this unceremonious end to the season means Marcus Mariota will likely be the starter the rest of the way.

NFL Week 15 Injury Report: Running Backs

Woody Marks, Houston Texans

In his first chance to be the true workhorse, Marks ultimately left the contest with an ankle injury and did not return, though head coach DeMeco Ryans said he could’ve returned, but they were already down heavily. Jahwar Jordan had 100 yards in relief of Marks, and may be the best option should Chubb and Marks not be able to return this weekend.

Devin Neal, New Orleans Saints

Neal suffered a hamstring injury and left Sunday’s game against the Panthers. With Kamara and Neal both injured, the Saints may turn to Evan Hull and Audric Estime next week, and maybe some increased work for Taysom Hill.

NFL Week 15 Injury Report: Wide Receivers

Rome Odunze, Chicago Bears

Rome was expected to play, but aggravated his heel injury in pre-game warmups and was ultimately inactive. Chicago faces Green Bay this week, with a chance to separate at the top of the NFC North, so Rome’s absence will certainly be felt. Head coach Ben Johnson has stated that all options are on the table at this point.

Luther Burden, Chicago Bears

Burden suffered an ankle injury Sunday and is day-to-day, per head coach Ben Johnson. This would be a major hit to the offense, with Rome also likely being out this Saturday. DJ Moore becomes a fringe WR2 if both are out.

Christian Watson, Green Bay Packers

Watson suffered a chest/shoulder injury and had to be taken to the hospital as a result. He has since been released and is returning to Green Bay, but his status for Saturday is up in the air.

Quentin Johnston, Los Angeles Chargers

Johnston was inactive this weekend with a groin injury, and his status for this coming weekend is also in the air. The Chargers struggled to move the ball, but also eliminated the Chiefs from playoff contention in their win. Johnston’s return to the lineup makes the offense more dynamic, so they’re likely hoping he can return this weekend.

Davante Adams, Los Angeles Rams

Adams aggravated the hamstring injury he was dealing with, and as a result, left the contest. He’s also unlikely to play Thursday, but has not been ruled out at this time. Monitor reports here throughout the week.

Drake London, Atlanta Falcons

After missing time with his knee injury, London is currently expected to return to action this weekend. We will need to keep an eye on injury reports throughout the week, but the team is very hopeful that he’ll return to action.",https://d29m18w01sxjzp.cloudfront.net/thumbnails/source/fatest/patrick_mahomes_nfl_injury_report_week_16-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 18:02:39.790427

The move marks the second starter the Buccaneers have placed on injured reserve in as many weeks, after losing guard Ben Bredeson to a knee injury in Week 15.
McCollum started 13 of the first 14 games of the season, missing one game in Week Six after undergoing surgery on his thumb.
The Buccaneers signed McCollum to a three-year contract extension just before the start of the 2025 regular season.
He has also played in and started three postseason games, all with Indianapolis, adding 12 tackles and a tackle for loss.","Facing a three-week stretch that will determine the 2025 champion of the NFC South, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers opened Week 16 with a round of roster moves, including the move of starting cornerback Zyon McCollum to injured reserve.

McCollum sustained a hip injury in last Thursday's loss to the Atlanta Falcons. He now must miss a minimum of four games before returning to the active roster, which means he will sidelined for at least the rest of the regular season. The move marks the second starter the Buccaneers have placed on injured reserve in as many weeks, after losing guard Ben Bredeson to a knee injury in Week 15.

The Buccaneers used the open spot on their 53-man roster to bring back linebacker Anthony Walker, signing him off the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad. Walker signed with the Bucs as an unrestricted free agent in March but was unable to participate in training camp due to a non-football injury and was released in the final roster cuts to 53 players on August 26.

Tampa Bay also made a change to its practice squad, signing defensive lineman C.J. Brewer and releasing wide receiver Brandon Johnson. Brewer had been on the Bucs' active roster until he was released last Wednesday when the team activated wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan off injured reserve.

McCollum started 13 of the first 14 games of the season, missing one game in Week Six after undergoing surgery on his thumb. He ranks fifth on the team with 65 tackles and has added one tackle for loss, one interception and six passes defensed. In his career, the 2022 fifth-round pick has played in 60 games with 42 starts and has recorded three interceptions, 33 passes defensed, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery to go with 239 tackles. The Buccaneers signed McCollum to a three-year contract extension just before the start of the 2025 regular season.

Walker is in his ninth season after being drafted in the fifth round by the Colts in 2017. He played four seasons in Indianapolis, three as a full-time starter, before signing with the Browns as an unrestricted free agent in 2021. After three seasons in Cleveland, in which he started 27 of the 28 games he played, he once again became an unrestricted free agent and moved on to Miami Dolphins for one season in 2024. He has logged a total of 99 games and 83 starts over eight seasons has amassed 581 tackles, 5.5 sacks, 26 tackles for loss, four interceptions, 21 passes defensed, two forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries in regular-season play.

Mahomes was scrambling to complete a pass down the right sideline with the Chiefs needing to beat the Los Angeles Chargers to keep their slim postseason hopes alive.

The Chiefs quarterback was taken from behind in a fairly innocuous tackle but was in immediate pain as he clutched at his left knee.

Mahomes went for an MRI after the game where it was confirmed that he had torn his ACL.

It was the same knee that had been giving Mahomes problems all week, with the superstar quarterback spotted putting a heating pad on it during last week’s game against Houston.

During his weekly interview on 96.5 The Fan, Mahomes was asked about the injury and tried to play it down.

“I feel like I’ve played a football season,” Mahomes said.

“You know, everybody’s kind of banged up and has his things here and there, but I’ll be ready to go, and I’m excited to get back out there on the football field and try to do whatever I can to get back in a better mindset of winning.”

The Chiefs entered Monday’s game still a chance of qualifying for the postseason, but they needed to beat the Chargers while also requiring the Bills to either lose to or tie with the Patriots, the Jets to beat the Jaguars and the Cardinals to defeat the Texans.

Buffalo, however, rallied from an early 14-0 deficit to topple New England 35-31 while both Houston and Jacksonville breezed to big wins.

While the immediate concern is Mahomes’ injury, attention will soon turn to what offseason changes may be necessary for an AFC heavyweight that had usually been an automatic staple of the NFL postseason.

In fact, the Chiefs had made three straight Super Bowl appearances despite the roster being far from perfect in all of those seasons, with the defence playing at a high enough level last year to make up for an offence that struggled to create many explosives.

This year, however, there were just far too many problems for Mahomes to overcome.

Specifically, injuries decimated the offensive line while the passing attack also lacked a consistent man-beater to really test defences.

The run game was also uninspiring, with both Kareem Hunt and Isiah Pacheco struggling to produce much more than what was blocked for them.

Of course, the Chiefs could also be down one of Mahomes’ most trustworthy weapons next season with uncertainty surrounding veteran tight end Travis Kelce’s playing future.

SUPER BOWL CONTENDERS SWEAT ON MAJOR INJURIES

While Kansas City’s season is over, the Los Angeles Rams and Green Bay Packers are top Super Bowl contenders but both teams potentially suffered serious injury setbacks in Week 15.

The Packers, riding high off the back of four-straight wins, fell 34-26 to the Denver Broncos, who improved to 12-2 with an 11th-straight victory — the longest active streak in the NFL.

Only compounding the loss for Green Bay, star pass rusher Micah Parsons — who the Packers landed in a blockbuster trade before the season — went down with a non-contact injury.

While an MRI will be needed to determine the full extent of the injury, there are fears Parson suffered a torn ACL.

The Packers also lost top receiver Christian Watson, who was playing the best football of his career after returning from a torn ACL, to a chest injury.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Rams beat the Detroit Lions 41-34 in a thriller but it came at a cost with veteran receiver Davante Adams appearing to suffer a serious hamstring injury.

Adams came up lame when tracking down a Matthew Stafford pass in the third quarter and limped off the field, having already been on the injury report throughout the week with a hamstring issue.

It would be a big loss for Los Angeles ahead of a crucial NFC match-up next week against Seattle, who survived a massive scare in a 18-16 win over the Indianapolis Colts.

The Colts, quarterbacked by 44-year-old Hall of Fame candidate Philip Rivers, looked on the verge of an unlikely win against one of the NFL’s most fearsome defences.

But in the end it was the boot of Jason Myers that proved the difference, with the Seahawks kicker slotting six field goals in the win.

BILLS STUN PATRIOTS IN BIG COMEBACK TO KEEP AFC EAST HOPES ALIVE

Elsewhere, Josh Allen fired the Buffalo Bills to a stunning comeback win against the Patriots.

The Bills’ 35-31 victory -- after having trailed 21-0 -- in sub-freezing conditions ended high-flying New England’s 10-game winning streak and kept the AFC East division title race alive.

“What makes this team this team -- we’re not out of it, we’re going to continue to fight one play at a time, no matter what the score is,” said Allen.

Reigning NFL Most Valuable Player Allen orchestrated five consecutive drives with touchdowns, at least temporarily thwarting the Patriots’ bid to reclaim the division title from Buffalo for the first time in five years.

The result underlined Buffalo’s status as a strong Super Bowl favorite despite inconsistent form this season.

“Obviously, the last five-ish years, we’ve found sustained success, but never been able to punch our ticket to the Super Bowl,” said Allen.

“And the end of the goal, that’s every team’s dream.”

The Patriots had been utterly dominant in the first quarter, with quarterback Drake Maye rushing for two touchdowns in the snow and rookie TreVeyon Henderson running 52 yards for a touchdown and a 21-0 lead.

The Bills battled back. Allen found James Cook and Dawson Knox with touchdown passes on either side of half-time.

Cook then barely kept the ball airborne as he stretched across the line for a third Buffalo touchdown that was initially ruled out by officials, before Allen seized the lead with a powerful 14-yard sling to Knox.

Henderson briefly reclaimed the advantage for New England with a stunning 65-yard sprint for a touchdown. But Cook barged through the Patriots line for the game-winning touchdown score.

New England -- who dominated the NFL in the Tom Brady era of the 2000s and 2010s but have faced a difficult rebuild -- still have three more regular season games to claim the AFC East, which they lead over the Bills by a single game.

Elsewhere, the Baltimore Ravens ended Cincinnati’s slim playoff hopes with a dominant 24-0 win, their defense shutting out Bengals star quarterback Joe Burrow.

And Jacksonville quarterback Trevor Lawrence managed five passing touchdowns and one rushing score as the Jaguars demolished the New York Jets 48-20.",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/a0fd7ca44a6a3d937078de380b685a7f,N,,2025-12-15 22:02:04.026192

The Packers also saw wideout Christian Watson go down with a chest or shoulder injury during the Week 15 loss to the Denver Broncos, but it appears he will be OK.

Watson avoided major injury, but it is unclear if he will miss any time, NFL Media reports. Watson, who caught three passes for 29 yards before exiting the matchup, suffered an injury in the third quarter while attempting to haul in a deep pass from Jordan Love.

The Packers offense struggled in crunch time in Denver, scoring just three points on their final six drives after racking up 23 points on the first five possessions. The play in which Watson was injured was the turning point, as the Broncos went on to out-score the Packers, 20-3, following Patrick Surtain II's interception.

The loss of Parsons is a massive one for the Packers defense, but it appears the offense avoided catastrophe on the Watson front.

Bam Knight, RB, Cardinals (ankle): Knight was carted off the field on Sunday after suffering a ""bad"" ankle sprain.
Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, Knight is unlikely to play in Week 16 against the Falcons.
Davante Adams, WR, Rams (hamstring): Adams was forced to leave Week 15 after pulling up short on a route with a hamstring injury.","It may be the end of an era to an extent for the Kansas City Chiefs (and even the NFL). Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes sustained a torn ACL in Week 15's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. The Chiefs were also eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since 2014 with the loss. You're likely navigating your fantasy football playoffs after advancing from Week 15. Below we're going to go over the NFL injury report for Week 16 with the latest on all the key injuries, plus fantasy football analysis.

Patrick Mahomes, QB, Chiefs (knee): With Mahomes done for the season, Gardner Minshew will man the offense the next two weeks against the Titans and Broncos before Week 18 vs. the Raiders. It's a downgrade for a passing game that was already wildly inconsistent most of the season. Rashee Rice and Travis Kelce will lose some ceiling but we've seen Minshew Mania sustain an offense as recently as 2023 with the Colts. Perhaps with the season done, Andy Reid and the offense will give rookies Brashard Smith and Jalen Royals some run.

Bhayshul Tuten, RB, Jaguars (finger): This isn't all that impactful given what we've seen from Jaguars RB Travis Etienne Jr. this season. But Tuten left in Week 15 and was unable to return in a blowout win over the Jets. Jacksonville may have just been proceeding with caution on the rookie RB's injury. Tuten had only two touches for 23 yards but one was a 16-yard TD catch. If Tuten is out, Etienne becomes an even stronger RB1/2 option, though he faces a tough task in Week 16 vs. the Broncos.

Devin Neal, RB, Saints (hamstring): The Saints can't really catch a break at RB this season. Alvin Kamara has missed the past three weeks with a knee injury. Now, the rookie Neal could miss time after exiting early against the Panthers. He did make due for managers with eight touches for 32 yards and a score before leaving. If Neal ends up missing time, the Saints are down to Audric Estime and Evan Hull as options in the run game unless Kamara can get healthy. New Orleans also has winnable matchups the next two weeks vs. the Jets and Titans.

Bam Knight, RB, Cardinals (ankle): Knight was carted off the field on Sunday after suffering a ""bad"" ankle sprain. Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, Knight is unlikely to play in Week 16 against the Falcons. As a result, Michael Carter got most of the work in the backfield, finishing with 94 total yards on 18 touches. He'll be a top waiver wire add this week while Emari Demercado isn't a bad stash in deeper formats.

Davante Adams, WR, Rams (hamstring): Adams was forced to leave Week 15 after pulling up short on a route with a hamstring injury. Head coach Sean McVay said after the game ""it didn't look good"" but wouldn't speculate on the severity of the injury. The Rams went on to beat the Lions and clinch a playoff berth, so don't expect Adams to be rushed back. He finished the game with four catches for 71 yards on nine targets. For the second straight week, Adams failed to find the end zone after scoring 11 times over the previous six games. If Adams is out, TE Colby Parkinson needs to be rostered in most formats. He has six TDs over the past six games.

Luther Burden III, WR, Bears (ankle): Burden exited in the Bears' win over the Browns but had six catches for 84 yards. He's been Chicago's more consistent pass-catching option the past two weeks with Rome Odunze sidelined. If Burden can shake off this injury and is good for Week 16 against the Packers, he'll be in a good spot as a WR3/flex option if Odunze, who initially was set to return on Sunday but was a late scratch after aggravating his foot injury, remains out. Keep in mind that game is Saturday night in what would likely be your fantasy playoff semifinals.

Christian Watson, WR, Packers (chest): Watson lost a 1-on-1 battle with Pat Surtain II on a deep ball from Jordan Love and landed hard on his chest/shoulder area. He was unable to return in the second half. Watson had just three catches for 29 yards prior to exiting. Prior to Week 15, Watson had over 18 fantasy points in three of four games, scoring five times in that span. Now, his status is likely up in the air for Week 16 against the Bears, a team he went off for a 4-89-2 line against a few weeks prior.

Edwards ends his 11th NFL season with 13 total tackles, 4 QB hits, 2 tackles for loss, and 1.5 sacks.

Head coach DeMeco Ryans also added updates on rookie running back Woody Marks (ankle) and cornerback Derek Stingley Jr. (oblique), who both left Sunday's game early with injuries. Ryans said both players should be fine, but it is something they are monitoring.

The New York Jets have fired defensive coordinator Steve Wilks after the team's 48-20 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 15. The Jets are the third-worst scoring defense in the league, allowing 28.4 points per game.

To cap it off, the Jets gave up six touchdowns to Trevor Lawrence on Sunday, five passing and one on the ground. Wilks was brought onto the staff by head coach Aaron Glenn after he was hired during the 2025 offseason.

Giants interim head coach Mike Kafka confirmed that rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart was evaluated for a concussion again in Week 15, ESPN's Jordan Raanan reported Sunday.

He missed just two plays before returning to the game, but his evaluation for a potential concussion speaks to a larger concern. As Raanan notes, Dart's evaluation in Week 15 marked his fifth such exam to check for a concussion so far in his pro career.

Just over a month ago, it was reported that the team wanted Dart to adjust his rushing style to err on the side of caution, presumably hoping he'd avoid taking the big hits that could put him at greater risk for a concussion. Dart had missed Weeks 11 and 12 with a diagnosed concussion — and no doubt, the Giants will want him to remain healthy moving forward, showing flashes of a potential franchise quarterback in the making.

Dart has rushed for 400 yards and seven touchdowns this year while completing 62.5% of pass attempts for 1,802 yards, 13 passing touchdowns and 4 interceptions.

The bad luck continues for Packers WR Christian Watson, who's battled a myriad of injuries through his NFL career.

This time, it was labeled a chest injury, as he went down in pain against the Broncos. He was ruled out with the injury and reportedly left the stadium in an ambulance, The Athletic's James Palmer reported.

Watson entered the 2025 rehabbing a torn ACL suffered in the playoffs last season and has dealt with hamstring issues throughout his career since he was selected in the second round of the 2022 NFL draft. Prior to Week 15, Watson had logged back-to-back games with 80-plus yards and a score.

ESPN's Rob Demovsky reported that Watson did travel home with the team after the game, following his evaluation at a local hospital.

The Green Bay Packers may have lost star pass rusher Micah Parsons for the rest of the season. Parsons is feared to have a torn ACL, and will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the injury Monday, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Parsons, 26, went down with a non-contact injury during the team's loss to the Denver Broncos in Week 15. It didn't look good in the moment, and there's ""not a lot of hope"" that the MRI will provide a more optimistic result, per Rapoport.

Losing Parsons would be a crushing blow for the Packers, who gave up two first-round picks and Kenny Clark to acquire Parsons in August.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are looking for linebacker help down the stretch. The team reportedly found that Monday, signing Anthony Walker Jr. off the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Walker, 30, is an eight-year NFL veteran who started eight games with the Miami Dolphins last season.

Walker has not played in an NFL game this season. Over his career, he has 581 tackles and 5.5 sacks.

49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan didn't mince words when asked about the team's decision to place WR Brandon Aiyuk on the reserve/left squad list earlier this week.

""We haven't seen him in forever,"" Shanahan told reporters in his post-game presser on Sunday.

That statement comes just weeks after it was announced that the team had reportedly voided approximately $27 million in guarantees in Aiyuk's contract for the 2026 season.

Aiyuk hasn't played since Week 7 of the 2024 season, when he suffered a torn ACL that he's rehabbed to this point in the season. He started the year on the active/PUP list; Shanahan then noted back in August that the team didn't expect Aiyuk to return until October at the earliest.

Time will tell how Aiyuk's latest chapter in his saga with the 49ers will play out, but signs certainly do continue to ""point toward divorce"" for the two sides as San Francisco keeps rolling without him, currently just one game behind the No. 1-seeded Los Angeles Rams.

The first-place Los Angeles Rams (11-3) enter Week 16 on a short turnaround, set to face the 11-3 Seattle Seahawks in a must-win divisional matchup on ""Thursday Night Football.""

They may have to do so without star wideout Davante Adams, however; Adams aggravated a previous hamstring injury in Sunday's win over the Lions.

The Broncos and Rams punched their post-season tickets but the play-off picture is far from clear.

The Green Bay Packers could be in trouble after a big injury of their own, while the Buffalo Bills stunned the Patriots with a comeback win that keeps alive their divisional fight.

Here's the pick of week 15 in the NFL.

The first play-off miss of his career and a torn ACL - it was a true nightmare for Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs as their run of 10 straight post-seasons came to a shuddering end.

With nine straight division titles, seven straight AFC Championship games and five Super Bowls, three of them won, it's been an incredible run for Mahomes - who has never previously ended a season before overtime in the AFC title game.

And so the Chiefs' inquest begins, starting with questions of when Mahomes will be fit to return and whether 36-year-old tight end Travis Kelce or head coach Andy Reid, 67, will return at all amid retirement rumours.

But where did it all go wrong?

Firstly their big strength has become their biggest weakness - winning tight games. After an NFL-record 11 one-score wins last year, the Chiefs have won one and lost seven that way this season.

And everybody has been at fault, including Mahomes for throwing some costly red zone interceptions. Reid has made some bad calls and Kelce and his fellow receivers have literally dropped the ball.

Fatigue could be a factor. Since Mahomes became starter, the Chiefs have played just two games under the maximum, and the constant deep play-off runs and Super Bowls can take its toll.

The defence has been excellent again, but the offence has been guilty of making the wrong play at the wrong time.

The other main issue has been protecting Mahomes, with offensive line issues a theme over the past few seasons.

Mahomes has taken the most quarterback hits in the NFL this season with 65, has been forced to attempt the joint-most scrambles with 52 and been pressured the third-highest number of times with 135.

In short, Mahomes just hasn't had the protection, and even when he gets his throws off, he's had the second-highest number of dropped catches with 26. For his own part, he's second on the list for bad throws with 81.

The two-time league MVP is the best quarterback of his generation, but while he's made mistakes, the team just haven't helped him.

The Chiefs' main priority once he returns is to protect their star man better and give him more reliable pass catches to let him do what he does best.

Green Bay also suffered a huge injury blow as defensive giant Micah Parsons went down with a suspected ACL injury during their damaging defeat in Denver.

The Broncos booked a play-off spot with the win and look the team to beat from the AFC. The Packers held that title in the NFC after four straight wins - but Parsons' injury could severely damage their Super Bowl hopes.

Green Bay handed two first-round draft picks to Dallas to sign Parsons in a blockbuster trade - and he's responded with 12.5 sacks in 14 games and a league leading 83 quarterback pressures.

He's often double-teamed to allow his team-mates more freedom to attack, and the Packers' defence drops from 10th to 22nd in quarterback rating allowed when he's not on the field.

More importantly, Parsons is one of those big-moment players who pops up with the big play at the right time, which can win you games when it matters most.

At one point Sunday, the Packers were heading to the NFC top seed, but they ended it down in the seventh and final play-off spot. Without Parsons, one of the big Super Bowl favourites could be in big trouble.

The Seattle Seahawks won a game for just the fourth time in their history without scoring a touchdown - Jason Myers kicking six field goals as they edged the Indianapolis Colts at home.

It was a Colts team led by 44-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers, who performed admirably less than a week after ending his five-year retirement as he nosed his side in front inside the final minute, before the Seahawks won it.

""It was exciting,"" said Rivers. ""Shoot, it was exciting to take a 13-3 lead. Obviously, you throw in the fact that it's been 1,800 days since throwing a touchdown or interception for that matter. So, yeah, both of those boxes were checked.""

Baltimore stayed alive in the play-off race with a 24-0 shutout of the Bengals in Cincinnati - their first shutout loss since 2017 (also against Baltimore) and the first of Joe Burrow's career.

Bengals head coach Zac Taylor could be in trouble after being eliminated from the play-offs for the third straight year.

Brock Purdy had a 140.3 quarterback rating as the 49ers beat the Titans to move to 10-3 ahead of one of the toughest finishes in the league.

“Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers.","Los Angeles Chargers which ended their playoffs hopes.

Mahomes and the Chiefs have been the dominant force in the NFL since he entered the league, but for the first time their future suddenly looks clouded with the three-time Super Bowl winner now facing a lengthy recovery on the sidelines.

The two-time MVP award winner scrambled to his right in the final two minutes of Kansas City’s 16-13 loss to the Chargers as he looked to keep the play alive before he was tackled from behind.

Mahomes had to be helped from the field, with the Chiefs posting a short statement to confirm the horrific injury news.

“An MRI has confirmed that Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes sustained a torn ACL in his left knee in today’s game,” the statement read.

“Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options.”

The Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention following the loss – their third in a row – which leaves them with a 6-8 record to sit third in the AFC West standings.

It’s a stunning fall from grace for a team that has made the past seven AFC title games, with the Chiefs making it through to five Super Bowls in that run.

But there are now questions over veteran tight end Travis Kelce and whether he retires, while Mahomes is likely to miss the start of the next NFL season which begins in September.

The Denver Broncos, Buffalo Bills and the New England Patriots are the favourites to win the AFC this season, while NFC hopefuls the Los Angeles Rams and Green Bay Packers are also dealing with fresh injury concerns for star receivers Davante Adams and Christian Watson.

“Don’t know why this had to happen,” Mahomes posted on X, with Gardner Minshew expected to finish the season for them at QB.

“And not going to lie it hurts.

“But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.

“Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.”",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/bd12a9818e25383c26edbc1b324851f2,N,,2025-12-15 15:02:29.752016

Giants Can’t Change Star Quarterback Eliminating opportunities for Dart to run would change the player he is and risk limiting his effectiveness.","He’s already become a frequent visitor to the blue tent for concussion-related checks during his first season in the NFL, but Jaxson Dart blasted the process and how he’s being treated by referees and spotters after the New York Giants‘ rookie quarterback was called off the field for two plays against the Washington Commanders in Week 15.

Dart was asked to visit the tent at a crucial moment of what turned out to be a 29-21 win for the Commanders. The Giants were at the one-yard line, but Dart was forced off after a collision with Washington defensive tackles Javon Kinlaw and Eddie Goldman.

It was a collision Dart revealed he didn’t view as a big hit when speaking to reporters post-game. Instead, the first-round pick in the 2025 NFL draft was “definitely surprised” about being sent for evaluation, per ESPN’s Jordan Raanan.

Dart put it candidly when he said, “(I) Definitely feel there is a sensitivity for some reason.”

Frustration was understandable after the Giants lost two yards on a run, before backup QB Jameis Winston threw incomplete, without Dart in the lineup. Another incompletion followed and the Giants turned the ball over on downs.

Dart has been defiant about running and taking big hits, but it appears officials and medical personnel are going to be more hands on about protecting the 25-year-old after four stints in concussion protocol.

Jaxson Dart Frustrated With Concussion Rules

An already lengthy history of concussion fears means Dart should expect some precaution around his health. Yet, he still “‘absolutely’ thinks he’s treated different than other players and doesn’t understand the increased sensitivity toward him,” according to Dan Duggan of The Athletic.

What’s ironic here is this wasn’t one of the designed runs that had subjected Dart to punishment. Instead, interim head coach Mike Kafka revealed the play was a pass, but “Dart didn’t like the look so he just tried to get back to the line,” per Duggan.

Dart did run nine times against the Giants’ NFC East rivals, but Kafka was noticeably light on calling designed runs for his battle-weary prized asset. This is the dilemma facing Dart and whoever replaces Kafka.

Giants Can’t Change Star Quarterback

Eliminating opportunities for Dart to run would change the player he is and risk limiting his effectiveness. The former Ole Miss stud is never going to stay static in the pocket, but he still needs to be smarter and more selective about unleashing his mobility.

It’s a difficult balancing act, but the Giants have to get it right if they’re going to count on Dart to inspire a rebuild beyond what’s been yet another miserable season. Dart boasts enough potential to be optimistic about the future, potential showcased by his 16-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Wan’Dale Robinson on 4th-and-5.

This was the second of Dart’s scoring strikes as part of a 246-yard output through the air. He’s a natural playmaker the Giants can build around, particularly with skill players like Robinson, fellow wideout Malik Nabers once he’s healthy, and versatile running back Tyrone Tracy Jr.

It’s an exciting nucleus, but the Giants must be able to count on their star signal-caller to stay on the field in clutch moments. That won’t happen unless Dart changes the narrative about the risks and hits he’s prepared to take as a runner.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2251905666-e1765752954135.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-15 15:02:37.699255

On a first-and-goal play, Dart tried to run for a touchdown when he was met by Javon Kinlaw and Eddie Goldman, who make up a combined 639 pounds of defensive lineman. Dart left the field and took the well-trodden path to the blue injury tent.

Fortunately for the Giants, Dart was able to return for the fourth-down play, but the rookie quarterback has taken too many hits like that throughout the season.

Of course we have his health, and everyone's health, in mind when we call plays.""

Kafka added that Dart's mobility is one of his ""great strengths, and there's no denying that. Dart ran six times for 63 yards against the Commanders. It's just a matter of Dart recognizing when to protect himself.

He missed just two plays before returning to the game, but his evaluation for a potential concussion speaks to a larger concern. As Raanan notes, Dart's evaluation in Week 15 marked his fifth such exam to check for a concussion so far in his pro career.

Just over a month ago, it was reported that the team wanted Dart to adjust his rushing style to err on the side of caution, presumably hoping he'd avoid taking the big hits that could put him at greater risk for a concussion. Dart had missed Weeks 11 and 12 with a diagnosed concussion — and no doubt, the Giants will want him to remain healthy moving forward, showing flashes of a potential franchise quarterback in the making.

Dart has rushed for 400 yards and seven touchdowns this year while completing 62.5% of pass attempts for 1,802 yards, 13 passing touchdowns and 4 interceptions.

The bad luck continues for Packers WR Christian Watson, who's battled a myriad of injuries through his NFL career.

This time, it was labeled a chest injury, as he went down in pain against the Broncos. He was ruled out with the injury and reportedly left the stadium in an ambulance, The Athletic's James Palmer reported.

Watson entered the 2025 rehabbing a torn ACL suffered in the playoffs last season and has dealt with hamstring issues throughout his career since he was selected in the second round of the 2022 NFL draft. Prior to Week 15, Watson had logged back-to-back games with 80-plus yards and a score.

ESPN's Rob Demovsky reported that Watson did travel home with the team after the game, following his evaluation at a local hospital.

The Green Bay Packers may have lost star pass rusher Micah Parsons for the rest of the season. Parsons is feared to have a torn ACL, and will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the injury Monday, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.

Parsons, 26, went down with a non-contact injury during the team's loss to the Denver Broncos in Week 15. It didn't look good in the moment, and there's ""not a lot of hope"" that the MRI will provide a more optimistic result, per Rapoport.

Losing Parsons would be a crushing blow for the Packers, who gave up two first-round picks and Kenny Clark to acquire Parsons in August.

49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan didn't mince words when asked about the team's decision to place WR Brandon Aiyuk on the reserve/left squad list earlier this week.

""We haven't seen him in forever,"" Shanahan told reporters in his post-game presser on Sunday.

That statement comes just weeks after it was announced that the team had reportedly voided approximately $27 million in guarantees in Aiyuk's contract for the 2026 season.

Aiyuk hasn't played since Week 7 of the 2024 season, when he suffered a torn ACL that he's rehabbed to this point in the season. He started the year on the active/PUP list; Shanahan then noted back in August that the team didn't expect Aiyuk to return until October at the earliest.

Time will tell how Aiyuk's latest chapter in his saga with the 49ers will play out, but signs certainly do continue to ""point toward divorce"" for the two sides as San Francisco keeps rolling without him, currently just one game behind the No. 1-seeded Los Angeles Rams.

The first-place Los Angeles Rams (11-3) enter Week 16 on a short turnaround, set to face the 11-3 Seattle Seahawks in a must-win divisional matchup on ""Thursday Night Football.""

They may have to do so without star wideout Davante Adams, however; Adams aggravated a previous hamstring injury in Sunday's win over the Lions.

As he was attempting to drive the Chiefs into range for what could have been a season-saving field goal against the Chargers, Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL, bringing an end to the most frustrating season of the two-time MVP quarterback's career. Hours later, in the middle of a wildly entertaining game with the Broncos, Packers edge rusher Micah Parsons is believed to have suffered the same injury while attempting to chase down quarterback Bo Nix. In addition to overshadowing perhaps the finest game of Nix's young pro career, the Parsons injury casts a pall on Green Bay's chances of competing for a Super Bowl this season, months after it traded two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark to acquire Parsons from the Cowboys.

As much as I would love to write about Nix or Philip Rivers or the relay-team pick-six the Ravens put together or the battle between the Bills and Patriots in Foxborough, the biggest story certainly is the season-ending knee injuries for two future Hall of Famers and what they mean for their respective teams and the rest of the league. The injury to Parsons means more for the Packers in 2025 than the Mahomes injury does to his team, as the Chiefs' playoff hopes were already hanging by a thin thread (and Kansas City has now been eliminated). But Mahomes' injury creates all kinds of questions about what the Chiefs look like when the QB does return to the lineup.

I'll start there, with an organization that was already facing a very significant offseason before the stakes were raised even higher.

What Mahomes' injury means for the Chiefs

What already felt like rock bottom for Chiefs fans hit a new low Sunday afternoon. Having lost four of their prior five games and needing a late comeback to claim their only victory since the start of November, the Chiefs were trailing in the latest of their must-win games, with the Chargers holding a 16-13 lead. The Chiefs had scored an early touchdown before spending the rest of the game struggling to move the football, but Mahomes had gotten the offense past midfield and within striking distance of a potential game-tying field goal. The air of invincibility was long gone, but the hope that Mahomes would conjure something out of nothing and keep the Chiefs alive for another quarter or another week until the old Chiefs somehow appeared hadn't been extinguished.

And then, suddenly, even that was gone when Mahomes left the game with his knee injury. While backup Gardner Minshew managed to turn a first-and-20 into a new set of downs, he threw an interception to Derwin James Jr., ending the game. But even if Minshew had been able to lead a late comeback, the season was essentially over when Mahomes went down injured.

And even if Mahomes had stayed healthy and played through the end of the season, this version of the Chiefs seemed broken on offense. Advanced metrics were more optimistic about the Chiefs than their record indicated, but Kansas City had pieced together just one above-average offensive performance over the past six games -- a loss to a Cowboys team whose defensive turnaround has been greatly overstated. There was no clear-cut culprit like the historically bad drop rate at wide receiver in 2023. The offense just wasn't getting better; if anything, after a brief burst at midseason, it was getting worse.

Two things came to mind immediately after the injury. One was the nature of how the Chiefs had survived when the offense had struggled, both early in the season and as recently as the first quarter of this game against the Chargers. Mahomes had always been an excellent scrambler, but he had typically leaned into scrambling in the postseason, when the games were more meaningful and there was simply less football ahead before the opportunity to rest during the offseason.

Before 2025, Mahomes averaged 2.5 scrambles per game during the regular season, and that figure rose to 3.3 during the postseason. They were high-value plays for the Chiefs, especially in the playoffs, where huge scrambles by Mahomes at the right time had played significant roles in dramatic wins over the Titans and Eagles.

Through Sunday, Mahomes had averaged 3.8 scrambles per game in 2025, including the 12-yard touchdown run that gave the Chiefs their only touchdown Sunday. And while that might not seem like an enormous difference, all scrambles aren't created equal. Scrambling into wide-open spaces only when they're available and sliding down without being touched is one thing, but Mahomes was often scrambling out of necessity this season, trying to move the ball in tight quarters. He was taking hits at the end of his runs, often because the Chiefs needed every one of those yards to pick up first downs or touchdowns when the offense was struggling.

Including sacks and quarterback knockdowns, Mahomes had been hit 153 times this season, a figure topped only by Justin Herbert, the quarterback on the other side of the field Sunday. That was a career-high through 14 games. A year ago -- with an offense that also needed to be jolted back to life amid a lack of playmaking talent and dismal left tackle play -- Mahomes was hit 147 times through his first 14 games. But across his six prior seasons as a starter, Mahomes took an average of 117.6 hits in his first 14 games of each season.

The 30-year-old has been hit 27% more often over the past two years than he had over his first six seasons as an NFL starter. Throw 40 more hits across three games in the 2024 postseason, and you get the idea. It's impossible to prove that correlation is causation here, and quarterbacks can suffer traumatic injuries without taking loads of hits, but Mahomes had essentially been playing all of 2025 like it was a playoff game. We can't fault the legendary quarterback for trying to win, of course, but it's just incredibly difficult to get hit the way he has for two years without missing time or suffering injuries.

The other thing I noticed was the name that came out over the PA as the cameras zoomed in on Mahomes. As the crowd came to a hush in Kansas City, I'm not sure anyone paid attention to the referees announcing a holding call on No. 72. That's Chukwuebuka Godrick, a 25-year-old rookie recruited through the league's international pathway program who was making his NFL debut. Godrick was forced onto the field after offensive tackle Jaylon Moore suffered a knee injury on the second snap of the game. (Moore attempted to return to the game but reinjured the knee in the second quarter and didn't appear after halftime.)

Chargers fans won't have much sympathy given what they've gone through at offensive tackle, but for the second year in a row, the Chiefs were stuck in December with tackles they couldn't possibly have wanted to play meaningful football this season. Last year, they rotated through Kingsley Suamataia, Wanya Morris and D.J. Humphries at left tackle before pushing Joe Thuney outside, which led to a disastrous appearance in the Super Bowl.

By the time Mahomes got hurt Sunday, the Chiefs had lost their top four tackles in Josh Simmons, Jawaan Taylor, Moore and Morris. Godrick was playing right tackle in his NFL debut, while the left tackle was Esa Pole -- who made his first appearance as a pro last week after Morris went down injured on the opening snap against the Texans.

For GM Brett Veach, this was the nightmare scenario that his 2025 offseason had attempted to avoid. Left tackle has been a revolving door for the Chiefs since Eric Fisher's departure, as they cycled through Orlando Brown Jr., Donovan Smith and then the 2024 cast before turning things over to Simmons, their first-round pick in the 2025 draft. Moore was the most expensive swing tackle in the NFL, a two-year, $30 million insurance policy in case Simmons or Taylor was unable to go. In a pinch, the Chiefs still had Morris, whom the organization trotted out for most of 2024 at left tackle, but they wouldn't actually need to call upon their fourth option at tackle, right?

Well, that plan didn't work. Nobody could have anticipated that Morris and Moore would go down on the opening series of games in consecutive weeks. Simmons dislocated his wrist against the Cowboys. Taylor hadn't missed a single game due to injury as a pro before going down with triceps and knee issues several weeks ago. Veach planned for what he thought could be the worst, and the 2025 season just laughed.

Devoting meaningful resources to even further depth at OT wouldn't have been a realistic or thoughtful use of assets. But the Chiefs didn't address some of the fundamental issues with their offensive infrastructure after the 2024 season. Those concerns have to be resolved by the time Mahomes returns to the lineup, because there are no guarantees they'll be getting the same Mahomes back, especially at first.

Mahomes' timetable for returning in 2026 will be unclear until he undergoes surgery. It's entirely possible that he's not ready to start next season on the active roster, which would force the Chiefs to begin with another quarterback under center and prioritize the backup role this offseason as a result. Since Chad Henne's retirement in 2022, the Chiefs have cycled through Blaine Gabbert, Carson Wentz and most recently Minshew as veteran options. Andy Reid prioritized adding a developmental backup in the draft during his time with the Eagles and eventually landed meaningful value in trades for QBs like Kevin Kolb and A.J. Feeley, but the Chiefs haven't drafted a quarterback since selecting Mahomes in 2017.

Regardless of when Mahomes returns, quarterbacks respond to knee injuries differently, and just about everybody takes some time to settle in. Tom Brady tore his ACL in Week 1 of the 2008 season, giving him three extra months to heal relative to Mahomes, and still didn't look like his usual self in 2009, posting what would be his worst interception rate in a single season. It's entirely possible that Mahomes, who relies far more on movement and extending plays than Brady did, struggles with his footwork and consistency even more acutely, which could lead to accuracy issues.

Will Mahomes come back with the same style of play? At 30, he might have already been slowing down and leaning less into the extended plays and out-of-structure creativity that served as his calling card as he ascended to the top of the NFL hierarchy. Mahomes' scrambles in 2025 were more north-south in nature, designed to pick up yardage as opposed to moving laterally and extending plays while hoping for someone to get open.

Will the Chiefs strongly discourage Mahomes from playing that way? Quarterbacks are going to do their own thing once they get on the field, but do you remember the last time Mahomes suffered a knee injury? In 2019, Reid called for a Mahomes sneak near the goal line, only for his third-year quarterback to suffer a dislocated kneecap. Mahomes came back after two games, but Reid was so scarred by the injury that he has refused to call a Mahomes sneak again, even in the highest-profile situations.

The Chiefs have still used Mahomes on speed options, even after he suffered a concussion running parallel to the line in the postseason against the Browns, and I'm not sure Reid is going to be able to fully discourage Mahomes from scrambling. But the balance has to shift. It would be a real shock if we saw the Mahomes who was scrambling as a necessity throughout the 2025 season again, at least during the regular season.

Kansas City simply can't ask Mahomes to do as much as he has over the past two seasons, particularly when it comes to absorbing hits and putting his body on the line. It hasn't produced consistently effective offenses and might have led to this. The only way to protect Mahomes is to build the rest of the offense up and ensure that the Chiefs don't need to rely on him putting himself in harm's way to win, at least on a weekly basis.

The Chiefs were already going to be thinking about the evolution of this offense during the offseason, where they were facing a series of important decisions. Now, with Mahomes suffering a serious injury, the Chiefs both need to take backup quarterback more seriously and will feel even more pressure to nail their next steps around the QB. Here's what's coming up for Kansas City and how the Mahomes injury affects them:

1. What does the end of the Travis Kelce era mean for reimagining the tight end room? The offense hasn't found consistency since Kelce faded after the 2023 season. He was incredible in 2022, when the Chiefs were able to build their post-Tyreek Hill offense around his mind meld with Mahomes and ability to beat both zone (by identifying and exploiting space in coverages) and man (by running away from linebackers or outmuscling defensive backs) coverages alike.

Kelce was still very good on a per-route basis in 2023, but he declined as the season went along. He was 18th in yards per route run among tight ends in 2024, and while that has jumped up to eighth in 2025, Kelce has also dropped a league-high nine passes -- three of which led to Mahomes interceptions. And while Kelce was never going to the Hall of Fame for his blocking, there have been more notable rough patches for him there, most notably in the Super Bowl loss to the Eagles.

For that production, the Chiefs have paid Kelce just over $17 million per year between 2024 and 2025, a figure that would be out of line if the guy receiving it wasn't a franchise icon and a surefire Hall of Famer. Any other player would have been released or asked to take a significant pay cut heading into 2025. But given that Kelce was already considering retiring before returning for this season, I'm not sure there was ever a realistic scenario where the Chiefs could have asked or expected their legendary tight end to come back for a fraction of what he was owed.

Kelce's contract expires after the season, though, and if he does return for one more go-around, it won't be at that price tag. Noah Gray has struggled with drops recently, but on a three-year, $18 million deal, the Chiefs would probably keep their 2021 fifth-round pick around for another season as the second tight end. Jared Wiley, selected in the fourth round of the 2024 draft, has two catches in nine games over two pro campaigns.

So whom do the Chiefs replace Kelce with as their primary tight end? And what does that mean for their offense? It's tempting to try to find a like-for-like replacement, but Kelce's one of the most unique players in recent league history. The Chiefs aren't going to be able to acquire someone like Brock Bowers or Trey McBride. Kyle Pitts Sr. is a pending free agent, but he's not the same sort of improviser as Kelce, and his blocking isn't up to even Kelce's standards. If he keeps having three-touchdown games down the stretch, the Falcons might even choose to franchise him.

This has been the year of offenses leaning into bigger personnel groupings, and progressive units are playing 13 personnel (1 RB, 3 TEs, 1 WR) and/or six offensive lineman sets more often than they have in years. Reid didn't invent going bigger, but leaning heavily into 12 personnel (1 RB, 2 TEs, 2 WRs) was one of the ways the Chiefs survived after trading away Hill, using the larger groupings to manipulate defensive personnel, reduce the scope of the defensive playbook and create checks they could exploit with Kelce.

Could the Chiefs lean into that and go with quantity over quality? Going after two or even three tight ends this offseason might be a way for them to replace Kelce in the lineup, if not necessarily his role in the offense. Veach could pursue tight end help earlier than he typically would in the draft, although the league's thirst for tight ends during the aforementioned personnel shift might cause players at a perennially underrated position to get pushed up the board.

The other option would be to evolve the offense away from a Kelce-like presence at tight end and spread the field more consistently, which would either be behind the curve or ahead of it, depending on whether you think those shifts to bigger personnel groupings have peaked. It's telling that the Chiefs left Simmons on an island more often than any other left tackle in the NFL this season while he was in the lineup, per NFL Next Gen Stats. If the Chiefs have two tackles they trust in pass protection and don't need to chip or keep a sixth player in to block, that would allow Reid to consistently get five eligibles out into routes. That hasn't always been the case over the past few years when the line hasn't been right.

2. What do the Chiefs do at right tackle? The Chiefs are $34 million over the projected cap in 2026. They'll get under that figure by restructuring contracts, most notably with Mahomes, who has a whopping $78.2 million cap hit on the books next year. I've expected the Chiefs would use 2026 as the year to renegotiate Mahomes' record-setting 10-year, $450 million deal, and while the ACL tear will create some uncertainty, I would be shocked if it changed the long-term plans in Kansas City. The Chiefs will work off Josh Allen's six-year, $330 million contract with the Bills as a baseline for Mahomes' new pact when it happens.

The Chiefs will have to decide whether they want to give cornerback Trent McDuffie a new contract, and they'll likely move on from Kristian Fulton after a disappointing stint. But the one big contract that might come up for discussion is at right tackle. Taylor is owed $20 million in the final year of his deal, none of which is guaranteed. That's top-tier right tackle money, and given his penalty issues, Taylor is more like a solid starter than someone challenging for Pro Bowl honors.

Cutting Taylor would free up $20 million and open up a spot in the starting lineup for Moore, who would take over at right tackle in the second year of his two-year contract. It would create a hole at swing tackle, but Veach would address that with some of the savings by moving on from Taylor. Suamataia could also move to right tackle, but that would just open up a different hole in the starting lineup at left guard.

3. Can Reid piece together a running game? The other way the Chiefs thrived after losing Hill was by working their way into a more physical rushing attack. Veach built a strong interior line through Joe Thuney and hit on draftees Creed Humphrey and Trey Smith. And while Clyde Edwards-Helaire was a bust as the team's 2020 first-round pick at running back, Isiah Pacheco's vicious running style quickly gave teams who defended the Chiefs with light boxes and two deep safeties something to worry about.

Pacheco played a valuable role on the 2022 and 2023 teams, but after fracturing his fibula in 2024, he hasn't been the same caliber of player. Reid briefly turned to Carson Steele before in 2024 bringing back Kareem Hunt, who had been cut by the organization in 2018 after kicking and shoving a woman. Hunt has been excellent in short-yardage situations over the past two seasons, but he has shown virtually no explosiveness and has just one run over 20 yards across 348 attempts in Kansas City.

While the Chiefs rank eighth in success rate on early-down designed runs over that timeframe, they're 20th in EPA per play on those carries. The threat of Mahomes has the Chiefs running into very friendly boxes, which should make life easier for their backs. They've also had at least two Pro Bowl-caliber linemen on the interior for most of that stretch in Humphrey and Smith. Frankly, the Chiefs have settled for mediocre running back play for too long, perhaps in part because they were burned by the attempt to make a more significant investment at the position in Edwards-Helaire, who ended up being a replacement-level back.

Veach wasn't naive to those concerns, as the Chiefs reportedly negotiated with the Jets to acquire running back Breece Hall at the deadline. The deal didn't come to fruition after Kansas City refused to send a third-round pick to acquire the pending free agent, which would have been a disaster given what has happened with Mahomes.

The Chiefs can go after Hall if he hits free agency this offseason, and backs like Rico Dowdle, Travis Etienne Jr. and Javonte Williams currently project to be on the market after impressive 2025 campaigns. No matter what the Chiefs do, this isn't a place where Veach can run things back with the same names and faces in 2026. Pacheco and Hunt will both be free agents, and a fresh start atop the depth chart would make sense for the Chiefs.

4. Do the Chiefs evolve schematically and stylistically? As the Chiefs have struggled in 2025, more of the fan base has criticized Reid's offense for being behind the cutting edge or remaining more stagnant than others around the NFL. Fans are always going to criticize offenses that aren't racking up 30 points per game, especially when they have a generational player at quarterback, so I'm a little hesitant to lean into those complaints myself. Everybody is going to have a bad playcall or two at the wrong time; that's just the reality of the NFL.

Is Reid's offense really behind the times? I'm not sure. Reid's a world-class game planner and has an incredible aptitude for picking apart opposing defensive rules with motions, shifts and other schematic choices. The offense had seemingly reduced itself in scope and turned into a quick game-intensive attack between 2023 and 2024, but that was partly a product of losing Hill and then having a sieve at left tackle. The Chiefs have had plenty of deep opportunities in 2025, but frankly, the offense just hasn't done a great job of executing in those spots, with Mahomes, the receivers and the pass protection each to blame at different times.

I'd love to see the Chiefs evolve their offensive philosophy a bit. We've seen teams lean into going under center, where there's more of a threat of hard play-action, and it's easier to get into more of the gap scheme runs that have flourished around the league in recent years. The Chiefs have generally resisted that trend and stuck in the shotgun, where they typically lean into zone runs and RPOs. They have seemingly been less effective over the past couple of years, and that approach will be harder with Mahomes recovering from a knee injury.

I've seen calls for Reid's job from the most virulent of Chiefs fans on social media, and while there are about 25 fan bases who want to fire their coaches on any given week, the Chiefs aren't firing Reid. They shouldn't, either. Even if we reframe this around the possibility of the legendary coach retiring, which great offensive mind would the Chiefs hire to replace Reid? The top offensive assistant on Dan Graziano's list of potential coaching candidates is Matt Nagy, who happens to be Reid's assistant. Guys like Joe Brady, Klint Kubiak and Arthur Smith are either unproven or have had their own issues in stops around the league. Mike McCarthy? Doug Pederson? Are they really going to be upgrades on Reid?

Any coach would want to work with Mahomes, but team owners aren't going to let their coaches go to Kansas City out of the kindness of their hearts. Acquiring someone like Mike Tomlin or John Harbaugh would cost draft capital, and those organizations aren't going to want to make life easier for the Chiefs if Reid retires. The Chiefs probably aren't in position to deal a Jon Gruden-sized haul to acquire a coach, even if the right one became available.

What's more realistic, perhaps, is Reid bringing somebody into the organization to serve as a fresh voice as an offensive assistant. The Chiefs don't need wholesale changes. They're not starting over. They're seventh in EPA per play over the past two seasons, which would be great for any team that doesn't have the best quarterback of his generation in the prime of his career. Mahomes has carried the Chiefs over the past two years, and we saw the diminishing returns of those efforts throughout a frustrating 2025 season. Now, it's time for the Chiefs to ensure that Mahomes won't need to put his body on the line as often when he returns in 2026.

What Parsons' injury means for the Packers

As they flew home from Denver on Sunday night, the Packers might have felt like a Super Bowl was slipping through their fingers. Just as Green Bay was getting healthier late in the season, injuries collapsed one of the league's most complete teams. Parsons is likely done for the year with a torn ACL. Christian Watson, who has looked like a star receiver for stretches since returning from his own ACL injury, went down with a chest injury on a Jordan Love interception and did not return. Right tackle Zach Tom was injured in the second quarter and didn't play in the second half, while safety Evan Williams wasn't able to play in the fourth quarter after suffering a knee injury.

With the likes of Tucker Kraft, Elgton Jenkins and Devonte Wyatt already on injured reserve, the Packers are staring down the threat of another postseason without multiple starters on both sides of the football. GM Brian Gutekunst's draft-and-develop philosophy generally leads the Packers to one of the deepest rosters in the league, but as we saw in last season's playoff loss to the Eagles, even that depth has its limits.

Gutekunst's stunning move to trade two first-round picks and Kenny Clark to acquire Parsons before the season both went against type and served as an announcement that the Packers weren't just accumulating talent. Factoring in a record-setting contract as part of the trade, Gutekunst was making an enormous bet that Parsons was going to be among the very best players in football over the next few seasons.

As teams trading for players like Khalil Mack and Jamal Adams have shown in years past, it's difficult for that bet to pay off. Trading unknown future picks for known superstars is great on paper, and there have been times (mostly involving the Rams) where it has worked, but the bar for success is extremely high. With the implied value of the draft picks sent to the Cowboys included, the Packers are paying Parsons the equivalent of $65 million per season over the next four years.

There's nothing inherently wrong with making that sort of move, but anything short of being the best player in the NFL is going to make that contract difficult to swallow. It's also putting a dramatic amount of the budget -- between actual cash and draft capital -- into one player staying both healthy and productive. Spreading the money and draft capital around throughout the roster means a team is less susceptible to one big injury than by concentrating so many resources into one player. Parsons' upside is such that I can (and still do) understand why the tradeoff would be worth it, but this is the football equivalent of putting a lot of your eggs in one basket.

To the extent that any non-quarterback can live up to that sort of price tag, Parsons was holding his own in Green Bay. He had 12.5 sacks in 14 games with the Packers, an even more impressive number when we consider that he was playing only in a part-time role early in the season after joining the Packers in August. Parsons led the league with 83 pressures, and his 34 quick pressures were second in the NFL behind Nik Bonitto. He wasn't going to win Defensive Player of the Year, given that Myles Garrett is currently producing one of the great defensive seasons in NFL history, but Parsons would have been competing with Will Anderson Jr. for the second edge rusher spot on the All-Pro team.

While the splits with and without Parsons weren't quite as significant as they were during his time with the Cowboys, we also saw a pretty significant split in Green Bay's pass defense with their star edge rusher on and off the field. With him in the lineup, the Packers allowed the league's 10th-lowest QBR to opposing quarterbacks. Across 109 dropbacks without him this season, the Packers fell to 22nd by that same metric.

What Parsons gave coordinator Jeff Hafley and the defense, really, was protection. The weak link on the Green Bay defense is at cornerback, where Nate Hobbs has been alternately injured and disappointing as the team's biggest free agent addition on defense. Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine struggle with consistency, and while Javon Bullard has had a very good second season working in the slot, the roughest games for the Packers defense have typically come when their corners have been exposed.

The Packers defense ranks 26th in the league in Total QBR when it doesn't get home with pressure on the opposing quarterback. Now, without Parsons, the pressure rate will inevitably drop. Players like Lukas Van Ness and Kingsley Enagbare have looked imposing at times across from Parsons, but they'll see more attention without Green Bay's best defender in the lineup.

One way to respond to those pressure concerns would be to send more bodies, something Hafley has been able to mostly avoid this season because of Parsons. The Packers send four or fewer rushers on nearly 80% of opposing dropbacks, the fifth-highest rate in the NFL. Despite dropping seven or more into coverage on the vast majority of snaps, the Packers still manage to get pressure on just under 35% of dropbacks, which is the eighth-best rate in the league. Every one of the teams ahead of the Packers in pressure rate also blitz more often than Green Bay.

When the Packers do blitz, their 53.8% pressure rate is second best, trailing only the Seahawks. Parsons plays a huge role in these pressures and creating opportunities for his teammates. Hafley knows that teams are terrified of what Parsons is going to do on every snap, and his presence can essentially serve as an indicator for what offenses will do in pass protection and what the Packers can do to break those rules. I'm skeptical that their blitz pressure rate will keep up without Parsons if the Packers lean further into sending extra pressure.

Hafley's sim pressures (which aren't technically always blitzes) have gotten more imposing as the season has wore on, and Parsons has created havoc on stunts and twists, with offensive linemen worried about letting him through and in turn allowing Green Bay's other rushers to run free in the process. Hafley didn't have the sort of time a coordinator would want to build the game plan around Parsons, given that the Packers acquired their new star only days before the season began. The Packers were getting better at maximizing Parsons, though. Now, all of that comes to a halt.

Parsons and the increased pressure rate were also covering for an issue the Packers have dealt with throughout the season: a lack of turnovers. Led by Xavier McKinney's eight interceptions, the Pack forced 31 turnovers in 2024, the fourth most of any team. On a drive-by-drive basis, only the Bills and Vikings forced more turnovers than the Packers, who turned 16.4% of opposing possessions into takeaways.

Turnover rates can fluctuate from year to year, though, and the Packers have forced only 13 in 14 games this season. They're ending just 9.1% of drives in turnovers, which has the Pack all the way down in 23rd, right ahead of the Vikings (who are dealing with the same year-to-year variance). The defense is recovering fumbles at about the same rate, but it is forcing fumbles about half as often as it did a year ago.

The bigger problem is that Green Bay has only seven interceptions in 14 games. One of those was Nixon's interception to seal up last week's win over the Bears, which was obviously a huge play, but Hafley's unit felt those missing picks in the loss to the Broncos. Bo Nix had his best game as a pro, going 23-of-34 for 302 yards with four touchdowns, but he also left a few balls in dangerous areas for the Packers. He threw two near-interceptions on the drive in which Parsons suffered his ACL injury, and Carrington Valentine dropped a third with 5:47 to go. When things are going well -- as they were in 2024 -- those throws turn into interceptions. When they aren't -- as has been the case for this secondary in 2025 -- they fall harmlessly to the ground.

The Packers have dropped from third in interception rate in 2024 to 26th this season. If there's a way they're going to overcome the Parsons injury, it's probably going to be through that turnover rate spiking back toward where it was in 2024. We've already seen much of the same key personnel produce an excellent takeaway rate in 2024, and the randomness of turnover rates is such that a team could go three months with a middling figure and then suddenly jump over the final few games of the season. The Eagles had 16 takeaways through their first 14 games a year ago and then racked up 23 over their final seven matchups, including 13 across their four-game run to the Super Bowl. The Packers could have that sort of late-season spree in them.

Parsons and his pressure should have made it easier to force those turnovers, though, so it'll be tougher to create takeaways without the superstar on the field. The combination of a Parsons-led rush and a turnover spike would have given the Packers a truly terrifying defense the rest of the way. And while Parsons is young enough at 26 to make an impact for years to come even after returning from the ACL tear, the Packers were least likely to feel the pain of missing out on those picks in 2025, given that the selections don't come off their books and won't be missing from the roster until 2026 and beyond.

This wasn't a one-year, all-in trade by any means, but the Packers were a Super Bowl-caliber team with Parsons in the mix. Now, suddenly, things are much tougher for the Packers in the NFC.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1215%2Fr1589489_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 09:00:08.480468
