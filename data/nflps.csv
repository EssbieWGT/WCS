,,2025-12-15 07:47:12+00:00,www.packers.com,Game notes: Josh Jacobs endures on injury-riddled day for Packers,Wes Hodkiewicz,,,,,https://www.packers.com/news/game-notes-josh-jacobs-endures-on-injury-riddled-day-for-packers-week-15-2025,"DENVER – As the hits keep coming for the Packers, Josh Jacobs keeps absorbing every blow coming his way.
The Broncos outscored Green Bay 20-3 the rest of the way while converting all four of their red-zone opportunities for the game.
""The game the whole day felt weird; even when we were up, the game felt weird,"" Jacobs said.
While the fourth-year receiver didn't return to the game, Watson was allowed to travel back to Green Bay with the team.
""That's a real critical piece to our offense, obviously,"" said receiver Jayden Reed, who led Green Bay with five catches for 55 yards.","DENVER – As the hits keep coming for the Packers, Josh Jacobs keeps absorbing every blow coming his way.

Listed as questionable with a knee injury entering Sunday's game with Denver, the Packers running back once again blocked out the pain and it was nearly enough to help Green Bay pull of a major road win over the AFC-leading Broncos.

Although the Packers fell 34-26 in front of 75,555 at Mile High Stadium, Jacobs gave the Packers a chance with 14 touches for 91 yards while scoring both of Green Bay's touchdowns.

And he was feeling the aftereffects of the hard-fought game afterwards.

""I'm sore. A little bit of everywhere honestly,"" Jacobs said. ""I told the guys, 'Man, you gotta know that I really care about this group because what we put our body through is crazy.' I'm definitely feeling that today.""

Jacobs has been battling a knee issue dating back to last month's 27-20 win over the New York Giants at MetLife. He missed two days of practice this week before returning on Friday.

Jacobs' importance grew in scale when his primary backup, Emanuel Wilson, was added to the injury report with an illness that had him questionable for the game. Wilson played but carried the ball just twice aside from returning kickoffs.

Green Bay moved the ball throughout the first half but was forced to settle for two Brandon McManus field goals before Jacobs made a terrific catch on a wheel route before halftime for his second career touchdown reception.

Quarterback Jordan Love fit the pass in perfectly to Jacobs, who hauled in the 14-yard touchdown over Dre Greenlaw to give the Packers a 13-7 lead with 4 minutes, 29 seconds left in the half.

""I've been asking them to call that all year,"" Jacobs said. ""I like me against a linebacker any time. It's crazy because like two or three plays before that, we were talking like we need to call that, we've been repping it and then we called it.

""I was trying to tell them, trust me. (Jordan) was like, 'I was throwing it either way. I knew what you were going to do.' Shout out to Jordan for that.""

Jacobs sparked the Packers out of halftime, too, when he broke a 40-yard touchdown run to extend Green Bay's lead to 23-14.

It was his longest run with the Packers and his longest touchdown run since a 63-yard score against Kansas City in Week 12 of the 2023 season with Las Vegas.

The game turned on the Packers' next possession, though, when Love fired a deep ball to receiver Christian Watson. Not only did reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year Patrick Surtain intercept the ball, but Watson also suffered a chest injury that knocked him out for the rest of the game.

The Broncos outscored Green Bay 20-3 the rest of the way while converting all four of their red-zone opportunities for the game. Meanwhile, the Packers finished 1-of-4 inside the 20.

""The game the whole day felt weird; even when we were up, the game felt weird,"" Jacobs said. ""We got in the red zone a few times, didn't score. We had a lot more penalties than we did the last several weeks.

""We look at this film and we know if we clean up a few things here or there it could be a totally different game. It still came down to the wire. They're a really good team. It's a really good team they have and we'll see them again.""

Injuries took their toll: In addition to losing Micah Parsons to a non-contact knee injury, the Packers finished the game without Watson, safety Evan Williams (knee), tight end Josh Whyle (concussion) and right tackle Zach Tom (knee).

Tom sustained his injury on the same play Jacobs caught his touchdown. Darian Kinnard finished the game at right tackle.

""It's definitely weird on the field seeing guys, 'Dang, another one. Another one is happening,' and it's key players,"" Jacobs said. ""It's guys who play big roles on our team. I don't know. In this game, that's part of this game. Sometimes you can't fill those shoes but somebody else is gonna have to step up and contribute. That's why it's a team sport.""

Watson's loss was a turning point in the contest, especially considering the impact he's had on the offense since he returned from the torn ACL that ended his 2024 campaign.

While the fourth-year receiver didn't return to the game, Watson was allowed to travel back to Green Bay with the team.

""That's a real critical piece to our offense, obviously,"" said receiver Jayden Reed, who led Green Bay with five catches for 55 yards. ""It's our job to go out there and execute and next man step up and make the play.""

Back to the Bears: With the Packers' loss and a 31-3 drubbing of Cleveland, Chicago improved to 10-3 and retook a half-game lead over Green Bay in the NFC North.

The two teams will meet this Saturday at Soldier Field, a rematch of last Sunday's game at Lambeau Field that saw the Packers win 28-21 on Keisean Nixon's game-ending INT.

""We got a short week, we gotta flip the page,"" defensive lineman Rashan Gary said. ""Get back on the Bears. I think they had a hell of a game today. Just gotta get back on track and that's what we're gonna do.""

Penalty problems: The penalty issues that hampered Green Bay earlier this season resurfaced in Denver, as the Packers were called for 10 infractions for 72 yards.

""It's just our job to go out there and execute the right way, not have penalties,"" Reed said. ""Not hurt ourselves. Even with me, I hold myself accountable because late in the game, in a critical game, I ran the wrong route. … so I hold myself accountable.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/iwhmkizifourvyoc4prw,N,,2025-12-15 03:58:52.822706

Quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL in the final moments of the game.

The loss ends the Chiefs' streak of seven consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances.

This season marks the first time the Chiefs have missed the playoffs since Mahomes became the starting quarterback.

So, this is how it ends.

Patrick Mahomes was knocked out of the loss that eliminated the Kansas City Chiefs in the waning moments of the game with a wicked left knee injury.

There was no cape for Superman to put on to save the Chiefs Kingdom this time.

Rats. Oh, you know he tried.

But the knee buckled and bent awkwardly. He lay on the turf in apparent anguish as the medical team administered treatment. Teammates went down to one knee. It was a somber scene at Arrowhead Stadium. Mahomes, who has demonstrated repeatedly that he is as great as it gets, is human after all. The Chiefs needed him to spark a last-minute rally for a game-tying field goal or even a winning touchdown, but there was nothing left.

Oh, you know he was game.

Mahomes scored the only Chiefs touchdown during the 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, and for much of the game was his team’s leading rusher. This was part of the problem. Too often, they’ve relied on him to do too much. He won’t win the NFL’s MVP award this season, but he deserves it nonetheless, because without him – and with all due respect to the oft-proficient, Steve Spagnuolo-coordinated defense that allowed just 16 points on Sunday – his team was toast.

He provided heart, soul, energy, hope and logic that with the Chiefs’ season on the line – and the remarkable streak of seven consecutive trips to the AFC championship game in the mix – there was still a chance to make a miracle run.

Until there wasn’t.

Minutes after the game, the ominous tone from Chiefs coach Andy Reid strongly hinted that the star quarterback was done for the year.

“It doesn’t look good,” Reid said during his postgame news conference.

The Chiefs followed on Sunday night with official confirmation that Mahomes suffered a torn ACL. A statement from the team added, “Patrick and the club are exploring surgical options.”

No Mahomes, no chance on Sunday. Now, what's next?

First things first: Hail to the Chiefs. This is the first time that Kansas City (6-8) won’t be in AFC playoffs since Mahomes became the starter, and it’s the first time the Chiefs have lost at least eight games in a season since 2012, when they were 2-14 in the season before Andy Reid became coach.

With Mahomes, the Chiefs won three Super Bowls and played in two others. In a parity-laden league leveled out by a salary cap, the Chiefs managed to keep winning, keep competing for crowns, to establish their own dynasty in the aftermath of the New England Patriots run powered by Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.

Now this.

Mahomes gamely limped off the field and to the bench under his own power after suffering his injury. And intentional or not, it was some kind of statement about the determination and pride that any of us who have watched him over the years realize runs so deep through his blood.

Minutes later, though, CBS’ cameras captured his journey to the locker room. Mahomes couldn’t get there on his own. He was helped up the tunnel with medical staffers holding him up on both sides like human crutches.

Sadly, this moment symbolized how this chapter – if not era – ends for the proud franchise that is now so battered.

Sure, Mahomes is the face of the Chiefs. But that was a dose of unintended insult added to injury. The Chiefs didn’t just lose. They lost their main man in the process.

With Mahomes knocked out of the contest, the Chiefs turned to Gardner Minshew, the backup quarterback without so much as a cape.

Minshew came in and promptly moved the chains with a short completion to Travis Kelce. Good idea. Good execution. Then the Chiefs were flagged for delay of game, with the poor execution of just getting the snap off reflected by the lack of urgency that you’d never see from Mahomes in this situation.

The next play, Minshew threw a lazy pass toward Kelce into double – or was it, triple? – coverage that was intercepted by Derwin James.

In other words, no Mahomes, no chance.

A weird January is coming in 2026. The last time the Chiefs weren’t in the AFC Championship Game? Try 2017. Way back on pre-pandemic Earth.

Maybe it is indeed the end of an era for the Chiefs, whose streak of nine consecutive AFC West titles was snapped. It’s certainly more than a mere speed bump.

Suddenly, this season, a team that knew how to win in crunch time – the Chiefs were 12-0 in one-score games last season and set an NFL record by winning 17 consecutive one-score games – couldn’t win the close ones.

On Sunday, the Chiefs fell to 1-7 this season in one-score games.

What next? There are glaring gaps with the running game and the pass rush, and who knows how much longer Kelce will play after mulling retirement last offseason. Yet with Mahomes being Mahomes – and it is apparent that rehab will dominate his offseason – they can still build around the quintessential centerpiece.

Yet nothing is automatic. As spectacular as Mahomes has been over the years, it was never automatic that he’d lead another Super Bowl run, even though it might have seemed that way. That was always packing a superhero cape. Now it’s not automatic that the Chiefs will quickly bounce back as a contender.

For a change, the Chiefs will have a long offseason to deal with their issues.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/14/USAT/87767071007-usatsi-27816950.jpg?crop=4453,2505,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-15 02:01:11.530962

""Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options,"" the team said in a statement.

Mahomes suffered the injury during the final drive of Sunday's game. After trying to extend a play to his right, he threw the ball away just before his left leg was twisted awkwardly as he planted his foot and Chargers defensive lineman Da'Shawn Hand brought him down.

Mahomes instantly grabbed his left knee in pain as the team's medical staff rushed toward Kansas City's star player. He needed assistance getting to his feet and draped his arms over the shoulders of trainers as he limped to the locker room.

""Don't know why this had to happen. And not going to lie it's hurts,"" Mahomes said in a statement posted to the social media website, X, minutes before the news of his torn ACL was made public.

""But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever.""

Mahomes, who had been dealing with a knee issue the past few weeks, was constantly harassed by L.A.'s defense before suffering the injury, getting sacked five times and sustaining several more hits while the Chargers pass rush pressured him on 48.6% of his dropbacks, per Next Gen Stats.

Sunday's loss also officially eliminated the Chiefs from postseason contention for the first time in Mahomes' eight years as a starter and the first time overall since 2014.

Mahomes, a two-time league MVP and three-time Super Bowl MVP, had previously made at least the AFC Championship Game in each season of his career as starting QB (since 2018).

Gardner Minshew replaced Mahomes under center for K.C.'s final drive, throwing a game-clinching interception in the Chiefs' last offensive play of the afternoon.

Micah Parsons' injury dashes Packers' Super Bowl hopes Overreaction vs. reality: Reality Week 15 couldn't have gone worse for the Packers.","Week 15 lived up to the hype. Leading up to the slate, it was poised to be one of, if not the, defining weekend of the 2025 regular season. As the action unfolded, we started to see the playoff picture come into focus, particularly with teams that will not be vying for a Lombardi Trophy this winter.

Most notably, the Kansas City Chiefs and Cincinnati Bengals were officially eliminated from playoff contention, meaning neither Patrick Mahomes nor Joe Burrow will be a factor in the AFC. That's good news for Josh Allen, who helped the Buffalo Bills rally from a 21-point deficit against the New England Patriots to keep his team's hopes of leaping into first place in the AFC East alive.

Naturally, there are numerous takeaways from the pandemonium that Week 15 produced. But which of those takeaways are something that will have legs for the final three weeks, and which are merely an overreaction? Below, we'll determine just that by taking a look at some of the notable storylines from Week 15 and figure out which we should take seriously and which we should chalk up as a mere overreaction.

Josh Allen has played himself into the MVP conversation

Overreaction vs. reality: Reality

Josh Allen was sensational in Week 15. The Bills QB kept his team's hopes of winning the division alive by rallying from a 21-point deficit over the New England Patriots in Foxborough. Allen led a second-half rally that saw Buffalo outscore New England 28-7, and the defending NFL MVP led five straight touchdown drives in the process. Allen finished the day throwing for three touchdowns to go with his 193 yards through the air and a 123.1 passer rating.

This was the third time this season that the Bills rallied from a deficit of 10 or more points, and the second in as many weeks. Not only does this latest comeback win keep Buffalo in range of the AFC East crown, but it should also thrust him into the MVP conversation with Drake Maye (who he just defeated) and Matthew Stafford. Allen just notched his third season with at least 25 passing touchdowns and 10 rushing touchdowns, which is the most in NFL history. If he gets Buffalo back atop the division, there's a strong case for a back-to-back MVP.

2025 NFL playoff picture, standings: Bills alive in AFC East, Chiefs eliminated, Broncos and Rams clinch

Eagles have fixed their issues on offense

Overreaction vs. reality: Overreaction

Philadelphia looked like a well-oiled machine during Sunday's 31-0 win over the Raiders. Jalen Hurts completed 12 of his 15 passes for 175 yards and three touchdowns, while adding 39 yards on the ground. This was Hurts' first game with three or more passing touchdowns since Week 8, and he had just four passing touchdowns over his last five games combined. Meanwhile, the Eagles averaged 5.9 yards per play and converted 10 of their 13 third-down situations in the win.

While this was encouraging for the offense, I wouldn't exhale fully if I were Philly. The Las Vegas Raiders are arguably the worst team in the NFL, and have struggled mightily in the secondary. Had the Eagles not had their way with them through the air in Week 15, it would've been a five-alarm fire. Simply put, they did what they were supposed to do and snapped a three-game losing skid in the process. Lucky for them, they get another easy matchup next week against a poor Commanders pass defense, so the good times should continue to roll. Have they actually fixed their issues, though? That remains to be seen.

Zac Taylor coached his last meaningful game for Bengals

Overreaction vs. reality: Reality

Joe Burrow made headlines this week when he made ominous comments about his playing future. However, I think more eyes should be on his coach. After a shutout loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Cincinnati is officially eliminated from playoff contention, which should make the seat under Zac Taylor hotter than the surface of the sun.

While he may not get the boot in the immediate aftermath of this contest, I believe he coached his last meaningful game for Cincinnati in Week 15, with the club potentially looking for new leadership once the regular season officially concludes. When you pair Burrow's comments with the lackluster effort we saw unfold in Week 15, this feels like an organization that has no one to inspire, which falls on the shoulders of Taylor.

Jaguars are the best team in the AFC South

Overreaction vs. reality: Overreaction

The Jaguars just notched their fifth straight win and is 10-4 on the season, which keeps them in first place in the AFC South. While the Jags are the No. 3 seed in the conference, I still have a hard time thinking they are the best in their own division, let alone one of the top clubs in the AFC. Trevor Lawrence was spectacular in Week 15, throwing for five touchdowns and adding a rushing score.

As impressive as it was, we have to point out that it came against the lowly New York Jets, and this current winning streak hasn't seen them beat a ton of powerbrokers in the NFL (Chargers, Cardinals, Titans, Colts, Jets). Next week's game at Denver will be a better barometer as to who this team actually is, and how we should view it in the overall playoff picture in the AFC. I think if you gave every playoff team in the AFC some truth serum, each would confess rather playing Jacksonville than Houston at the moment.

Shedeur Sanders played his way out as Browns QB of the future

Overreaction vs. reality: Reality

It was a memorable day for Shedeur Sanders for all the wrong reasons. The Browns quarterback struggled mightily in a 31-3 loss to the Chicago Bears, completing just 51.4% of his passes for 177 yards, no touchdowns, and three interceptions. Those turnovers should be Cleveland's biggest concern as the Browns continue to evaluate the rookie as a potential franchise quarterback.

Sanders had just two interceptions over his first three career starts, so to see the floor fall out from under him here may be the first domino that takes him out of consideration as the QB of the future. Certainly, Sanders didn't do himself any favors in convincing the Browns to steer clear of drafting a young signal-caller.

Seattle is fools' gold after nearly losing to Philip Rivers

Overreaction vs. reality: Overreaction

The Seahawks were nearly the butt of the joke throughout the NFL, had they not pulled off a last-minute comeback to avoid being upset by the Colts. Specifically, it would've been a horrendous look for a team earmarked for the playoffs to lose to a 44-year-old Philip Rivers, who hadn't played an NFL game for 1,800 days. Naturally, allowing Rivers to run somewhat efficiently has folks wondering if we're viewing Seattle all wrong. Are they really as big a threat as their 11-3 record indicates? Or are they merely fools' gold, and this outing against Rivers was a glimmer of their fraudulence?

With a massive showdown with the Rams on deck for Thursday, I think Seattle was simply caught sleeping a bit in this game and looking ahead to that matchup. Its strong play defensively and an offense centered around Jaxson Smith-Njigba is enough to make them dangerous in the playoffs, even if it didn't quite look like it on Sunday.

Micah Parsons' injury dashes Packers' Super Bowl hopes

Overreaction vs. reality: Reality

Week 15 couldn't have gone worse for the Packers. Coming into the day, they were the No. 2 seed in the conference and in first place in the NFC North. However, after losing to the Broncos, they've fallen all the way to the No. 7 seed, with the Bears leaping back ahead of them. To make matters even more dire, star pass rusher Micah Parsons left Sunday's loss with what is reportedly feared to be a torn ACL.

If/when that injury is confirmed, Parsons' absence this season could also result in the end of Green Bay's Super Bowl hopes. Parsons was the straw that stirred the drink of their defense and led the unit with 12.5 sacks on the season. With him out of the picture, it completely changes how opposing teams game plan against them and dramatically lowers the ceiling of the defense. With a pivotal game against the Bears next week, his absence will be felt almost instantly.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/15/dbdf8ff2-3276-4870-b277-649d9ed3b3bc/thumbnail/1200x675/bec4feb50e158d20c3eb2274656fbd23/micah-parsons.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 21:58:58.691548

Patrick Mahomes suffered a left knee injury late in the fourth quarter of Sunday's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers and is set to undergo an MRI either Sunday night or Monday, head coach Andy Reid told reporters after the game.

Reid did not speculate on the severity of the injury, but he said that the play ""didn't look good.""

Mahomes suffered the injury while trying to extend a play to his right, throwing the ball away just before his left leg was twisted awkwardly as he planted his foot and Chargers defensive lineman Da'Shawn Hand brought him down.

Mahomes instantly grabbed his left knee in pain as the team's medical staff rushed toward the two-time Most Valuable Player. He needed assistance getting to his feet and draped his arms over the shoulders of trainers as he limped to the locker room.

""Don't know why this had to happen. And not going to lie it's hurts,"" Mahomes later posted on the social media website, X. ""But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever.""

Gardner Minshew replaced Mahomes with the Kansas City's playoff hopes on the line.

Down 16-13 with 1:53 remaining and the ball at the Chargers 46-yard line, Minshew completed three short passes before Derwin James intercepted his fifth pass attempt of the drive to end the game and eliminate a divisional rival from an 11th-consecutive postseason berth.

Mahomes was constantly harassed by L.A.'s defense before suffering the injury, getting sacked five times and sustaining several more hits while the Chargers pass rush pressured him on 48.6% of his dropbacks, per Next Gen Stats.

It amounted to a trying effort on Sunday for Mahomes, who went 16-of-28 passing for 189 yards, including one brutal interception early in the fourth quarter that led to a long Chargers possession that took seven-plus minutes off the clock.

Green Bay Packers star edge rusher Micah Parsons suffered a non-contact knee injury against the Denver Broncos on Sunday night, and it's doesn't look good for the rest of the 2025 season.

It was initially believed that Parsons, who was infamously traded to the Packers from the Dallas Cowboys before the start of the 2025 season, tore his ACL in his left knee, according to multiple reports.

Some believed Parsons mouthed, ""I’m out,"" as cameras were close up on him to get a look at the moment. Parsons would eventually walk off the field, but he hung his head as he went into the locker room. Broncos star cornerback Pat Surtain II even walked over to Parsons, understanding the situation could be very serious.

Upon review of the play, Parsons had a lane to Nix, but the quarterback quickly moved to his left. That caused Parsons to plant his left leg hard into the turf, and that’s when he immediately grabbed his knee as he went down to the ground.

Parsons left the game with two total tackles.

PATRICK MAHOMES SUFFERS BRUTAL KNEE INJURY AS CHIEFS ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFF CONTENTION

The obvious thought when seeing a non-contact injury involving a knee is that it’s a torn ligament. While the belief is Parsons suffered the torn ACL, an MRI on Monday will confirm what the Packers unfortunately believe.

This injury comes at the worst time for the Packers, who are in the midst of a playoff race. They came into Sunday leading the NFC North with a 9-3-1 record, facing a Broncos team who have won their last 10 games. The Broncos moved that streak to 11, though, as they beat Green Bay, 34-26, after Parsons left the game.

The Packers’ pass rush has been a main driver behind tremendous production on their end. Entering Sunday, the Packers ranked fifth in the NFL in yards allowed per game (287.2) and points allowed (19.0), while Parsons has enjoyed a successful first year in Green Bay.

Parsons, the two-time All-Pro and four-time Pro Bowler, tallied 12.5 sacks in 14 games with 39 combined tackles and one forced fumble. He was already past his 2024 total of 12 sacks and hoping to get more before heading toward the playoffs, granted the Packers made it in as one of the seven NFC seeds.

Parsons was not only traded from the Cowboys to the Packers this offseason, but he also signed a massive five-year, $210 million extension with $120 million guaranteed. The deal made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL, and it was immediately debated whether the Cowboys made the right move.

Star wide receiver Davante Adams suffered a hamstring injury during the fourth quarter of the Rams’ 41-34 win over the Detroit Lions.

Adams was injured as he attempted to track a deep pass thrown by Matthew Stafford on third-and-3 with 12:42 on the clock in the fourth quarter. Adams stayed down on the turf for a few moments before he was helped off the field by the Rams’ medical staff. He was able to walk off the field and into the locker room under his own power.

The Rams deemed Adams questionable to return, but he never checked back into the game.

Adams produced four catches for 71 yards at the time of his injury. The veteran wideout leads the NFL with 14 receiving touchdowns this season. He was questionable going into Week 15 due to a nagging hamstring injury.

The 12-year receiver entered Week 15 with 56 catches, 718 yards and 14 touchdowns on the season.

Mahomes was injured shortly after the two-minute warning in the fourth quarter while attempting to extend a play. After taking contact, he went down awkwardly and remained on the field before being helped to the sideline, unable to place full weight on his leg. He did not return, and backup quarterback Gardner Minshew finished the game.

The injury overshadowed the result and further complicated a difficult season for Kansas City, which was already on the brink of playoff elimination. Mahomes had been managing knee soreness earlier in the week but entered the game without an injury designation. Before exiting, he completed 16 passes for 189 yards.

Shortly after the game, Dr. Jesse Morse, a sports medicine physician known for analyzing NFL injuries, offered a measured but concerning outlook.

Morse explained that the mechanism of the injury raises concern for structural damage within the knee, including the possibility of ligament involvement. While he cautioned against jumping to conclusions, he acknowledged that an ACL tear is among the outcomes that must be ruled out based on how Mahomes' knee reacted following contact.

The MRI has confirmed that Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes sustained a torn ACL. According to Morse, the timeline for recovery is just under 10 months until, so there is a strong chance he could be fully recovered and ready for Week 1 at the start of the 2026 season. Assuming there are no complications during rehab.

What comes next for Kansas City

In the short term, Mahomes will miss the remainder of the season, and the NFL is preparing to moving forward without one of its franchise quarterbacks.

The news was first reported by Pro Football Talk.

Parsons sustained a noncontact injury to his left knee in the third quarter against the Denver Broncos.

In the same quarter, the Packers also lost perhaps their most explosive offensive player in Christian Watson to a chest injury.

Parsons pulled up while trying to rush Broncos quarterback Bo Nix and immediately grabbed his left knee. He was able to walk to the locker room but with a significant limp. He was ruled out in the fourth quarter.

Parsons did not record a sack Sunday, but he made his presence felt early when he forced a fumble against Broncos running back RJ Harvey on the game's opening drive that was recovered by Packers linebacker Edgerrin Cooper.

To date, Parsons' first season with the Packers has been a resounding success after they traded two first-round picks plus defensive tackle Kenny Clark to the Dallas Cowboys to acquire him shortly before the season. The Packers gave Parsons a four-year, $188 million contract on the same day they traded for him.

With 12.5 sacks coming into the game, Parsons is the first player in NFL history to record at least a dozen sacks in each of his first five NFL seasons. Parsons also came into Week 15 with an NFL-leading 60 pressures, 10 more than any other player in the league and the most pressures by any player within a team's first 13 games of a season in the past seven years.

Watson was ruled out shortly after his injury, which occurred when Broncos cornerback Pat Surtain II landed on top of Watson while intercepting a deep pass from Jordan Love. Watson appeared to land hard on his left shoulder, with Surtain's body weight making it worse.

Before leaving, Watson had three catches for 29 yards in the game, and the Packers were leading 23-14.

Watson was playing in his eighth game of the season after missing the first two months while recovering from a knee injury. He had been highly productive since his return with 25 catches for 452 yards and five touchdowns.",https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1215%2Fr1589424_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 19:59:05.174793

Parsons was on the ground for a while, being attended to by athletic trainers after going down while chasing Broncos quarterback Bo Nix. He eventually got up and walked to the locker room with assistance.

The Packers also lost wide receiver Christian Watson to a chest injury earlier in the third quarter. Watson was injured when a pass intended for him was intercepted by Broncos cornerback Patrick Surtain. The Packers trailed the Broncos 27-23 when the fourth quarter began.

The impact of losing Parsons

We don’t know the official diagnosis for Parsons’ knee injury, but it didn’t look good. Losing him for the season would be a crushing blow to the Packers’ Super Bowl hopes. He’s arguably been the second-best defensive player in the NFL this season behind the Cleveland Browns’ Myles Garrett.

Parsons’ face after his non-contact left knee injury spoke volumes, as did his teammates taking a knee and Broncos players coming over to wish him well as he left the field. Parsons needed the assistance of two trainers to limp off the field and then into the locker room. You could argue that Parsons is even more irreplaceable than quarterback Jordan Love, and the Packers already lost one of their most important players in tight end Tucker Kraft for the season to a Week 9 torn ACL. — Matt Schneidman, Packers beat writer

Entering Week 15, Parsons ranked tied for third in the NFL with 12.5 sacks, third in total pressures with 74 and second in pressure percentage (19.2 percent), according to TruMedia. He had rejuvenated a Packers pass rush that couldn’t consistently get home with four last season, after which defensive line coach Jason Rebrovich was fired.

The Packers’ acquisition of Parsons on the eve of the season, in one of the sport’s most seismic trades ever, injected life into not only Green Bay’s defense but also its locker room and the fan base. Parsons had been everything the Packers hoped when they shipped off their next two first-round picks and franchise cornerstone Kenny Clark. Now, they hope his knee injury isn’t as serious as it appeared.

The biggest news of the day comes in the health department, as three-time MVP Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL late in the fourth quarter of Sunday's loss against the Chargers. Not only were they eliminated from playoff contention for the first time since the 2014 season — they'll also be without their star quarterback the rest of the way, with Gardner Minshew stepping in as the next man up.

The Green Bay Packers also got some brutal news, as star defensive end Micah Parsons suffered what is feared to be a torn ACL against the Denver Broncos on Sunday. Parsons tallied 12.5 sacks over 14 games in his first season with the Packers, following his blockbuster trade from the Cowboys this offseason. He's notched another 12 tackles for loss and a forced fumble.

The Packers will face the Chicago Bears next week in a game that will almost certainly define the division.

Along with the injury news, there were plenty of shake-ups in the NFL playoff race. Here's where things stand heading into SNF:

He had five touchdown receptions in the last four games heading into the contest at Denver.

The San Francisco 49ers get lucky!

The Tennessee Titans very nearly cut the Niners' lead to four points with a field goal attempt at halftime, but kicker Joey Slye was no good from 50 yards as time expired.

The superstar quarterback awaits further testing to diagnose the extent of his ailment, and coach Andy Reid said postgame that Mahomes will undergo an MRI later on Sunday or on Monday. Gardner Minshew closed the game in relief of Mahomes, who walked off the field and was able to put weight on his left leg.

The injury occurred while Mahomes was rolling out toward the sideline and throwing the ball downfield. A Chargers defender pulled him to the ground during the throw, and his leg bent awkwardly as he lost his footing.

""I don't know, but it doesn't look good,"" Reid said of the severity of Mahomes' injury. ""You guys saw it. We'll just see where it goes.""

Mahomes remained down on the field for multiple minutes while trainers examined his leg. He was in clear discomfort and removed his helmet before rising to his feet and walking into the medical tent. Trainers then helped him walk up the tunnel and into the locker room.

The Chiefs trailed, 16-13, when Mahomes left the contest. He completed 16 of 28 passes for 189 yards without a touchdown, and he threw one interception and took five sacks. Mahomes did find the end zone with his legs, however, and took two carries for 15 yards and a score.

Patrick Mahomes injury clouds Chiefs' outlook for 2025 and beyond

With the loss and the results in other games on Sunday, the Chiefs are eliminated from playoff contention. Kansas City faced a number of elimination scenarios entering Week 15, and a string of results occurred in the early window to dash its postseason homes. The loss to the Chargers, combined with the Jaguars' win over the Jets, the Bills' win over the Patriots and the Texans' win over the Cardinals triggered a nightmare outcome for the Chiefs, who will watch the playoffs from home for the first time since 2014.

The 10-year playoff streak was the second longest in NFL history behind the Patriots' 11-year run from 2009-19.

This is the first time in Mahomes' nine-year career that he will not participate in the postseason. The injury also clouds his outlook for the rest of the regular season. Regardless of the severity, the Chiefs could opt to either slow-play his return or hold him out for the final three games altogether considering they do not have a division or conference title to play for, nor are they in the hunt for playoff seeding.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/14/a1b381fe-1fd1-435d-aad1-5e7f3b6d6cf5/thumbnail/1200x675/a72e1f2edba7069d276cbb9b1581df48/untitled-design-2025-12-14t134555-134.png,N,,2025-12-14 17:58:46.806009

The injury occurred as Mahomes was tackled from behind by Chargers defensive end Da'Shawn Hand. Mahomes immediately reached for his left knee after being rolled up from behind and remained down on the sideline as he received treatment from Kansas City's medical staff.

Mahomes was eventually helped to his feet and hobbled over to the bench. He was taken to the blue medical tent for further treatment before being seen hobbling into the locker room with two Chiefs staffers holding him up by the shoulders.

Mahomes was replaced by veteran backup Gardner Minshew. The 29-year-old completed 3 of 5 passes for 22 yards in place of Mahomes but threw an interception to Derwin James with just 14 seconds remaining in regulation.

The pick sealed a 16-13 loss for the Chiefs and eliminated them from postseason contention.

Patrick Mahomes injury update

Andy Reid told reporters during his postgame news conference that Mahomes would have an MRI on his injured left knee by Monday. The 67-year-old sounded pessimistic when discussing the star quarterback's injury.

""It didn’t look good,"" Reid said when asked about Mahomes' injury. ""We'll just see where it goes.""

The Chiefs did not immediately provide an update about Mahomes' status after he exited the game. Just two minutes remained in the fourth quarter when he left the field, and he did not return to action.

The Chiefs have just three quarterbacks in their organization, including Mahomes. They are as follows:

Patrick Mahomes

Gardner Minshew

Chris Oladokun (practice squad)

When asked if he fears Mahomes’ injury is serious, Reid said, “I don’t know, but, I mean, it didn’t look good. We’ll see where it goes.”

Mahomes needed help getting up and was heavily limping on the sideline after getting hit by Chargers defensive end Da’Shawn Hand. Backup quarterback Gardner Minshew entered the game with the Chiefs trailing 16-13 and threw an interception to Derwin James to seal Los Angeles’ win.

With the loss, the Chiefs have been eliminated from postseason contention for the first time since 2014.

First, to recap the bad news. The Lions will be without their top three safeties in this game, as Kerby Joseph was ruled OUT on Friday, while Brian Branch was placed on injured reserve, and Thomas Harper was downgraded to OUT on Saturday after not clearing the NFL’s concussion protocol.

Decker has been nursing a shoulder injury all season. While it’s become customary for him to miss a practice or two during the week as part of his injury management plan, he missed all three practices this week, raising some concerns about his availability for this game.

Fortunately, Decker’s absences were just for rehabilitation purposes, and he IS ACTIVE for this game and is expected to start at left tackle.

Unfortunately, there’s a bit more bad news. Kayode Awosika, who had been starting at left guard in place of Christian Mahogany (on injured reserve), will miss his second game with a foot injury. Look for the Lions to once again turn to veteran Trystan Colon to start, while also mixing in rookie Miles Frazier to get some reps.

Buffalo is elevating DE Morgan Fox and LB Baylon Spector from the practice squad

The offensive tackle earns his fourth consecutive nomination for his work in the community.

The Bills celebrate and recognize the difference-makers in their community.

In the Bills's 26-7, Benford recovered a fumble and returned it 17 yards for his first career TD, added an interception, two tackles (one solo), one TFL and one pass defensed.

St. Brown, one of the best players in all of fantasy football, said this week he's moved past his ankle injury and will be ready to go against the Rams in a massive game for his Lions.
“It was a little sore after the game, but it wasn’t too bad,” St. Brown said Thursday.
But no one has ever questioned St. Brown's toughness and after missing most of the Packers game with the ankle injury, it's looking like he won't miss any more time from the injury.

Amon-Ra St. Brown's fantasy football status was very much up in the air for Week 14 against the Dallas Cowboys when the wide receiver barely was able to gut it out and play in a huge win on Thursday Night Football.

St. Brown, one of the best players in all of fantasy football, said this week he's moved past his ankle injury and will be ready to go against the Rams in a massive game for his Lions.

“It was a little sore after the game, but it wasn’t too bad,” St. Brown said Thursday. “It’s getting better every day so that’s good. I feel like hopefully it’s behind me now.”

St. Brown initially sprained his ankle in the Thanksgiving Day game against the Green Bay Packers and at the time it was looking like he might miss at least a few weeks.

But no one has ever questioned St. Brown's toughness and after missing most of the Packers game with the ankle injury, it's looking like he won't miss any more time from the injury.

Although St. Brown looks like he'll be on the field for the Lions, the team will be far from healthy. Offensive lineman Christian Mahogany has been ruled out as he recovers from a broken leg, star safety Brian Branch has been placed on injured reserve with a torn Achilles, and the Lions are super thin at tight end as Sam LaPorta is out for the year with a back injury.

Quiet first quarter in Cincy

Neither the Baltimore Ravens nor the Cincinnati Bengals made noise in the first quarter of a critical AFC North showdown, scoring a collective ... *checks notes* ... zero points in the first quarter.

Both teams combined for 49 net offensive yards over 20 total plays as both teams struggled to find rhythm in a frigid matchup.

Ravens QB Lamar Jackson, who's struggled with health this season, had completed just two passes for six yards in the first quarter ... which puts him at -5 net passing yards when taking into account his two sacks for a combined 11-yard loss.

Will they pick on a weakness … again? The Chargers, in their 27-21 Week 1 victory over the Chiefs in Brazil, provided a roadmap for the rest of the league to follow when it came to attacking K.C.’s defense.

Specifically, quarterback Justin Herbert feasted when going to play action. According to NextGen Stats, Herbert finished 9 of 11 for 169 yards on those attempts, which began a trend that was often repeated afterward.

SumerSports’ data has the Chiefs defense as worst in the NFL when going against play action, allowing 0.49 expected points added on those attempts. For context, Cleveland’s defense is second worst but still much better at 0.33 EPA per play allowed, while on typical downs, K.C.’s defense allows only 0.02 EPA/play.

Herbert and the Chargers actually haven’t been super-productive with play action for the season, ranking 15th in efficiency. Given their success in Game 1, however, expect them to test the Chiefs often in this area again.

Jacksonville are 4-1 against teams with a losing record this season. Buoyed by four straight wins (during which they have outscored opponents 125-52), the NFL’s No 1 rushing defense is yet to allow a 100-yard rusher in 13 games.

Parker Washington returns from a hip injury to strengthen a constantly rotating receiving corps, which continues to come up with answers. It helps that Trevor Lawrence is playing with confidence and poise with Jakobi Meyers making a significant impact since joining on November 4. In five games, Meyers has caught 22 of 30 for 284 yards with three touchdowns - one in the past three games. And running back Travis Etienne needs 83 rushing yards for his third 1,000-yard season.

Against a rookie quarterback making his first NFL start, the Jags are 13.5-point favorites. The last time they were favored by such a margin was in 2007 against the Oakland Raiders (they won 49-11). All signs point to a Jaguars win. Dangerous territory, perhaps. But they have comprehensively handled business recently and played balanced, complementary football and looked like the AFC’s No 3 seed of late.

Bills WR Gabe Davis is a healthy scratch against the Patriots, the team confirmed to The Athletic ahead of kickoff. The move is a surprising one, given quarterback Josh Allen's trust level in Davis, and also because Davis has been at the top, or near the top of the leading snap count earners in their receiver room for three straight weeks.

Davis made a clutch catch on a fourth down play against the Bengals in Week 14. Without Davis, the Bills will go with the group of Khalil Shakir, Joshua Palmer, Keon Coleman, Tyrell Shavers and Brandin Cooks. Palmer returned today from a two-week absence due to an ankle injury.

Quietly, one of the Chiefs’ biggest issues defensively has been an inability to create turnovers.

In K.C.’s last five games combined, it has one takeaway: a first-quarter interception against Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott on Thanksgiving.

The Chiefs should have a great opportunity to reverse that trend Sunday. The Chargers have been careless with the ball quite a bit recently, with quarterback Justin Herbert throwing two interceptions with an additional lost fumble in Monday’s win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

Some of this comes down to luck, of course. It seems whenever the Chiefs defense tips a ball in the air, it deflects to an empty space on the field. Or when they create a fumble, the ball has bounded to a spot where the offense can recover.

This sort of thing continues the theme of the Chiefs season, where they just haven’t been good enough in the margins to turn close losses into wins. Sunday offers a new opportunity to make one or two game-changing defensive plays.

The Chiefs and Chargers are set to play on what is forecast to be Kansas City’s coldest day over the next month.

There are some important caveats, though. Snow is not in the forecast, and it’s not supposed to be windy, either. The sun should be out as well, meaning a kickoff temperature in the teens should actually feel warmer than the thermometer indicates.

It’s still unclear how a warm-weather team like the Chargers will respond to these conditions. The Chiefs are used to them — they practice in them each week, with some guys like tight end Travis Kelce taking part in those workouts in short sleeves and shorts.

K.C., in a must-win game, might’ve actually benefited more if the conditions were worse. It still wouldn’t be a surprise, though, if the Chiefs are the team better equipped to handle these weather conditions early.

FOXBORO, Mass. – Since Week 7, the Patriots have played with a light box on defense more than any other team in the NFL.

Essentially, they dare teams to try to run it on them, happy that the lighter boxes will help the Pats slow down opposing passing offenses. So far, it’s been a successful strategy.

But in recent games, the Patriots’ run defense has slowed a bit, and it poses a fascinating matchup Sunday since the Bills, with James Cook, have a really good running offense.

So I’m watching today how dedicated the Bills are to running the ball, whether the Pats will be content to play with light boxes, and how any Bills success on the ground early impacts the Patriots’ gameplan.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Chiefs will be without All-Pro cornerback Trent McDuffie for Sunday's home game against the Los Angeles Chargers, as he was listed as a gameday inactive after suffering a knee injury last week.

McDuffie, who was questionable coming into the game, leaves a void in the Chiefs secondary as the team's unquestioned top defensive back. Jaylen Watson should slide into the No. 1 slot today, and third-round rookie Nohl Williams should now see extended snaps for a second straight week.

One other note: Chiefs fourth-round receiver Jalen Royals, who hasn't played since Week 7, is a gameday active with Hollywood Brown (personal) out for Sunday's game.

Here's the Chiefs' full inactives list:

OT Jawaan Taylor

OG Trey Smith

WR Hollywood Brown

TE Jared Wiley

CB Trent McDuffie

DT Zacch Pickens

RB Elijah Mitchell

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ --- The Giants will be in a tough spot of their own making at returner Sunday with WR Gunner Olszewski inactive. Olszewski suffered a concussion in Week 13, but the team team went up to the last minute with the receivers' availability for Sunday.

But in the mean time, the Giants didn't elevate two other return options (Ihmir Smith-Marsette and Xavier Gipson) on their practice squad. So who will act as returner now? CB Deonte Banks and RB Devin Singletary are the kickoff returners while safety Jevon Holland acted as punt returner when Olszewski was injured in Week 13.

Other inactives include: OLB Kayvon Thibodeaux, WR Ryan Miller, P Jamie Gillan, T James Hudson III, DL Rakeem Nuñez-Roches Sr. and QB Russell Wilson (3rd QB).

Ravens starting wide receiver Rashod Bateman is inactive for Sunday’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals because of an ankle injury. Bateman, who was limited in Thursday’s practice and didn’t practice Friday, will miss his third game this season.

Wide receivers DeAndre Hopkins, Devontez Walker and Tylan Wallace will all likely have bigger roles with Bateman sidelined.

Outside linebacker Tavius Robinson, who hasn’t played since Week 6 because of a foot fracture, and defensive back Ar’Darius Washington, who has been out the whole season after tearing his Achilles in May, are active.

The Ravens five inactives are emergency No. 3 quarterback Cooper Rush, Bateman, offensive lineman Joseph Noteboom, defensive tackle Aeneas Peebles and cornerback Keyon Martin.

Bills inactives vs. Patriots: WR Gabe Davis, OT Tylan Grable, OT Chase Lundt, DT Phidarian Mathis, LB Terrel Bernard, CB Christian Benford, S Darnell Savage

The most significant member of the inactive list is top cornerback Christian Benford, who suffered a toe injury during Thursday's practice. The Bills were veering toward full health of their 53-man roster for the first time this season, but Benford's in-practice injury meant they'd be shorthanded at cornerback. In his place, the Bills will use the combination of Tre'Davious White and Maxwell Hairston as their starting boundary cornerbacks. The Bills will get wide receiver Joshua Palmer back into the lineup after he missed a pair of games with an ankle injury. Only having room for five receivers on the game day roster, the Bills made Gabe Davis inactive. It remains to be seen if Davis was a healthy scratch for the game, though Davis was not listed on the injury report during the week.

Davis was not seen on the field with the receivers during the usual pregame warmups. Starting middle linebacker Terrel Bernard is inactive once again and will miss a third straight game. Shaq Thompson will start in his place.

Los Angeles Chargers WR Quentin Johnston is inactive for Sunday’s game at the Kansas City Chiefs. Johnston practiced on Wednesday and Thursday this week, but he appeared on the injury report Friday with a groin injury. Johnston was listed as limited for Friday’s practice. The temperature at game time at Arrowhead Field is projected to be under 20 degrees. Those are not ideal conditions for a player trying to return from a soft-tissue injury in a limited timeframe. With Johnston out, rookie Tre’ Harris will have a huge opportunity Sunday.

Harris has carved out a role primarily as a blocker in coordinator Greg Roman’s offense. The Chargers have weaponized Harris in various rushing concepts, including as a lead blocker in power. But he has not made the same kind of impact as a receiver, with Johnston, Ladd McConkey and Keenan Allen ahead of him on the depth chart. Harris has 20 catches for 185 yards on the season. Harris will likely take over Johnston’s position as the Chargers’ X receiver. In that role, Harris could get some chances to make plays down the field, particularly in 50-50 ball situations, one of the strengths of his skillset.

S Elijah Molden (hamstring)

CHICAGO -- Veteran guard Joel Bitonio and wide receiver Cedric Tillman are active today for the Browns despite having been listed as questionable on Friday's injury report.

The Browns had previously ruled out seven players due to injury: tight end David Njoku, cornerback Denzel Ward, guard Wyatt Teller, running back Dylan Sampson, offensive tackle Jack Conklin, defensive tackle Adin Huntington and guard Zak Zinter.

Longtime starting center Ethan Pocic was placed on injured-reserve last week after suffering a torn Achilles tendon. Luke Wypler takes over as the starting center with the hopes of being able to become the starter in 2026.

Wypler and right tackle KT Leveston are the only starting Browns offensive linemen today who are signed for 2026. Saturday, the Browns signed rookie guard Garrett Dellinger from the practice squad to the active roster so that Dellinger can serve as a potential backup option at both guard and center today.

It's the fourth start for rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who threw for 364 yards and three touchdowns last week. Sanders has developed a rapport with rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr., the Browns' leading receiver, and the two rookies have connected on touchdown passes in each of the last two weeks. But with the offensive line injuries and issues, expect the Bears to mix up their looks and blitzes to try to keep Sanders from getting comfortable.

No opposing quarterback is comfortable with Browns defensive end Myles Garrett looming. Last week, Garrett became the 13th player to reach 20 sacks in a season. Garrett enters today just 2.5 short of the NFL's single-season sack record currently shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt.

With a clear emphasis on not letting Garrett blow up their game plan, the Titans ran for 184 yards on the Browns last week in Cleveland. Expect a run-heavy plan from the Bears today, too. The Bears totaled 281 rushing yards in a Week 13 upset in Philadelphia and will use both veteran starter D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai heavily.

With the Browns shorthanded at multiple spots, expect Sam Webb to start at cornerback in Ward's place and veteran defensive tackle Maurice Hurst to see time also. Hurst was signed to the practice squad last week and elevated on Saturday. As expected, rookie defensive tackle Mason Graham is active despite dealing with a rib injury.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/VnTrvdjsDfr8_hYdkIfhtspdY_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-14 12:59:50.506897

Spillane is officially active for Week 15, which is huge for New England's run defense, in particular, against the Bills potent rushing attack led by star RB James Cook. The Patriots game-day inactives are OLB Bradyn Swinson, OT Marcus Bryant, DT Eric Gregory, TE C.J. Dippre, WR Efton Chism III, and QB Tommy DeVito is the emergency third quarterback.​

Along with Spillane being active, the well-rested Patriots will also get NT Khyiris Tonga, LG Jared Wilson, and special teams ace Brenden Schooler back from injury this week. All three regulars are returning to the lineup after being inactive for New England's victory over the Giants in Week 13. Pats captain Harold Landry III, who has been managing a knee injury, also seemed to benefit from the bye week as he didn't carry an injury designation into Sunday's game. As one would hope, the bye week helped the Patriots roster get healthier.​

Starting on the defensive side of the ball, Spillane was first limited by his foot injury when he only played 69.1% of the defensive snaps in Week 13. In the previous eight games, Spillane played every defensive snap, so his lower snap count vs. the Giants was notable. The Pats captain is the team's starting MIKE linebacker and defensive signal-caller, playing a major role in the middle of the defense. This season, the Pats defense allows a stingy -0.03 expected points added per rush when Spillane is on the field compared to +0.05 EPA per rush without Spillane – a substantial difference. Buffalo comes into the week ranked seventh in rush EPA, while Cook is second in the NFL with 1,308 rushing yards. The Bills rushing attack is very underrated, with most of the attention on MVP quarterback Josh Allen. In Week 5, holding Cook to a 36% success rate was a big reason why the Patriots won.

With the Patriots captain active, Spillane's workload and effectiveness will be worth monitoring during the game. Tonga's return should also help the Pats stop the run, as the 335-pound nose tackle has helped New England hold opponents to -0.10 EPA per rush when Tonga is on the field – the Patriots need two of their best run defenders at their best. That said, if Spillane is limited by his foot injury, the Patriots could lean more on linebackers Jack Gibbens and Christian Elliss. Jahlani Tavai is also active as a sturdier early-down run stuffer, while LB Marte Mapu could have a role in the passing game on Sunday.

Moving over to the other side of the ball, the Patriots offensive line gets a boost by the return of rookie Jared Wilson. After playing only three snaps in a Week 12 win over the Bengals, Wilson sat out the Patriots last game against the Giants due to an ankle injury. The third-rounder is expected to return to being the starting left guard, while the Pats still have reliable backup G/C Ben Brown as insurance, as they start their fourth different line combination of the season. The expectation is that the Patriots starting offensive line will be LT Vederian Lowe, LG Jared Wilson, C Garrett Bradbury, RG Mike Onwenu, and RT Morgan Moses.​

Offensively, the other uncertainty was at running back, with RB Terrell Jennings ruled out due to a concussion. On Saturday, the Patriots signed RB D'Ernest Johnson to the active roster to back up top backs Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. After being elevated three times earlier this season, Johnson was out of standard elevations, meaning he had to be signed to the 53-man roster to be active. New England made room for Johnson on Saturday by placing Jennings on injured reserve. Johnson has some experience on special teams, including returning kickoffs, making him an obvious choice to step in for Jennings.

QB Drake Maye's Supporting Cast

OL - LT Lowe, LG Wilson, C Bradbury, RG Onwenu, RT Moses

WR - Diggs, Boutte, Hollins, Douglas, Williams

TE - Henry, Hooper, Westover (FB), Tonga (short-yardage FB)

RB - Stevenson, Henderson, Johnson

The good news is that the majority of the Patriots skill players around QB Drake Maye this week are all active. New England will have all their regular contributors available to match Allen and the Bills offense. Above is a look at Maye's supporting cast for Sunday's game against Buffalo.

As for Buffalo, the Bills are getting starting DE Joey Bosa (hamstring/wrist) and RT Spencer Brown (shoulder) back from injury. However, Bills top CB Christian Benford (toe) and LB Terrel Bernard (elbow) is inactive. Benford was a mid-week addition to the injury report after suffering a toe injury during Thursday's practice. He's the Bills best corner, logging a pick-six to spark Buffalo's comeback win over the Bengals last week, and might've covered Patriots wideout Stefon Diggs in key situations. Benford being inactive is a huge blow to Buffalo's defense, which will rely more on vet Tre'Davious White and first-rounder Maxwell Hairston at cornerback.

With a win, the Patriots would dethrone the Bills after a five-year run as kings of the AFC East. Buffalo has won five-straight division titles, with New England's last AFC East crown coming in Patriots Hall of Famer Tom Brady's final season in New England (2019). To win the division in their first season under head coach Mike Vrabel would be a huge accomplishment, especially after having back-to-back four-win seasons before Vrabel arrived.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/ciefxkkkmcvxzltk2uhr,N,,2025-12-14 13:00:06.878891

Pittsburgh won a crucial division game over the Ravens in Week 14 after losing its previous two games.
In the Week 14 win over Baltimore, Rodgers completed all three of his deep passes (20-plus air yards) for 121 yards to Metcalf.
Rodgers had a season-high 284 passing yards as Metcalf led the Steelers with 12 targets, seven receptions and 148 receiving yards in Week 14.
The Dolphins defense is riding high into Monday's game after recording a season-high six sacks in Week 14.","The Dolphins have won four straight games and, with just a 1% chance to make the playoffs, are looking to play spoiler toward the end of the season. Miami's win streak is the franchise's longest within a season since 2022. After a 1-6 start to the season, Mike McDaniel and the Dolphins have turned things around.

Heading into Monday's game, the Steelers are leaders of the AFC North, but it's a tight race with the Baltimore Ravens in the rearview mirror. Pittsburgh won a crucial division game over the Ravens in Week 14 after losing its previous two games. But the Steelers will be without one of the best pass rushers in the NFL for Week 15, with T.J. Watt recovering from surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung.

A key part of Miami's recent winning streak is running back De’Von Achane. The Dolphins RB has had 100-plus scrimmage yards in each of the last five games for Miami. Since Week 9, Achane leads the NFL with 147 scrimmage yards per game (4-1 record). In the Week 14 win over the Jets, Achane suffered a rib injury and did not return as the Dolphins leaned on Jaylen Wright with their RB1 sidelined. Wright did the most with his opportunity as he had a career-high 24 carries to go with 107 rush yards and one touchdown. Achane's status was in question earlier in the week, but the dual-threat RB is in line to play in Monday's game. Achane, who stands at 5-foot-9 and weighs 191 pounds, ranks first in the league with 5.8 yards per carry and 4.4 yards after contact, according to Next Gen Stats. If the Dolphins would like to pull off an upset and play spoiler, Miami will be leaning on Achane and Wright to extend its win streak to five games.

It appears that the Aaron Rodgers-DK Metcalf connection is peaking to unlock the deep pass game. In the Week 14 win over Baltimore, Rodgers completed all three of his deep passes (20-plus air yards) for 121 yards to Metcalf. The Steelers QB did not complete a deep pass in the entire month of November. Rodgers had a season-high 284 passing yards as Metcalf led the Steelers with 12 targets, seven receptions and 148 receiving yards in Week 14. It was Metcalf's first game with 145-plus receiving yards in a game since Week 4, 2022 when he was a member of the Seattle Seahawks. With the running game averaging the fourth-fewest yards in the league (89.2 rush yards per game), Rodgers building chemistry with his No. 1 WR at this time of the season is a positive trend that Pittsburgh would like to continue to develop heading into the final few games of the season and possibly the playoffs.

Since Week 9, the Dolphins defense has not allowed opponents to score more than 17 points. Despite trading pass rusher Jaelan Phillips at the trade deadline, Miami's defense, headlined with linebackers Jordyn Brooks and Bradley Chubb, has thrived. Brooks leads the NFL with 142 tackles, with Chubb leading the Dolphins with 6.5 sacks and 16 QB hits this season. The Dolphins defense is riding high into Monday's game after recording a season-high six sacks in Week 14. Meanwhile, the Steelers defense will be without T.J. Watt for the first time in the regular season since 2022. Watt leads the team with seven sacks and 18 QB hits, but the Steelers have 10 players with at least one interception this season, which is most in the league.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/veswjybib3vtkkb0krzm,N,,2025-12-14 15:00:54.629395

No one wants to see a player get hurt, but the Jets own the Colts' 2026 and 2027 first-round picks that they acquired in the Sauce Gardner trade.
Coupled with their own first-round pick (currently seventh), the Jets would have plenty of ammo to trade up for a player.
When the Jets and Colts made the Gardner deal at the Nov. 4 trade deadline, the Colts were 7-2, looking like a Super Bowl contender.
""I was fortunate enough to have a coach that believed in me the same way I believe in Wilks,"" Glenn said.","JACKSONVILLE -- A look at what's happening around the New York Jets:

1. One team's misfortune ... : Is the Achilles curse working in reverse?

The Jets, doomed by Achilles injuries in 2023 (Aaron Rodgers) and 1999 (Vinny Testaverde), could benefit greatly from last week's season-ending injury to Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones.

No one wants to see a player get hurt, but the Jets own the Colts' 2026 and 2027 first-round picks that they acquired in the Sauce Gardner trade. Currently, the 2026 pick is 18th overall. The Colts (8-5), already reeling before the Jones injury, have a brutal remaining schedule -- Seattle Seahawks, San Francisco 49ers, Jacksonville Jaguars and Houston Texans.

Combined record: 36-16.

If the Colts lose out, the draft pick could go as high as 13th, give or take a spot. Coupled with their own first-round pick (currently seventh), the Jets would have plenty of ammo to trade up for a player. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, anyone?

That would be a stunning turn of events.

When the Jets and Colts made the Gardner deal at the Nov. 4 trade deadline, the Colts were 7-2, looking like a Super Bowl contender. Jets officials figured the draft pick would be toward the bottom of the first round. Now the Colts have lost three straight and face the prospect of starting quarterback Philip Rivers, 44, five years removed from retirement.

This is the same Rivers whom the Jets defeated in their next-to-last playoff run, in the 2009 season, when he played for the San Diego Chargers.

One final twist: A Jets loss Sunday to the Jaguars, who are one game ahead of the Colts in the AFC South, could hurt Indianapolis' playoff bid. The Jets have only a 24% chance to win, per ESPN Analytics.

2. Same as it ever was: This is the Jets' eighth trip to Jacksonville to play the Jaguars, dating back to 1996, and not once have they arrived with a winning record. Think about that for a moment.

3. Another one-and-done? One of the top storylines over the final four games will be the future of defensive coordinator Steve Wilks.

The defense is ranked 28th in EPA (Expected Points Added) and has only one takeaway in what has amounted to a transition year, an on-the-fly rebuild accelerated by the trades of Gardner and Quinnen Williams.

Ultimately, coach Aaron Glenn's decision will be based on whether he believes Wilks is the right man to lead the defense through the next phase of the rebuilding process. No doubt, there will be many new pieces to integrate in 2026.

Statistically, the defense has regressed over the course of the season. The EPA went from 26th over the first seven games (-23.66) to 29th over the last six (-47.12). The only starter exceeding expectations is defensive tackle Jowon Briggs, which doesn't reflect well on player development.

Wilks acknowledged the defense has been ""inconsistent at times, for sure,"" but he also believes there were a handful of encouraging performances.

Glenn was in Wilks' shoes in 2021 -- his Detroit Lions defense was among the league's worst -- but he had the support of coach Dan Campbell. He gave Glenn another chance as the coordinator, which proved mutually beneficial in the long run.

""I was fortunate enough to have a coach that believed in me the same way I believe in Wilks,"" Glenn said.

That might sound like a vote of confidence, but Glenn said he will evaluate his staff at the end of the season. Chances are, he will make some changes. Wilks understands the business; he was a one-and-done coach in his last five jobs.

4. Interception drought update: There have been 298 interceptions in the league, including five by Jaguars linebacker Devin Lloyd, but none by the Jets. They're one game shy of the all-time mark for most consecutive games without a pick (14 games by the 2024 49ers).

5. One tough Cook-ie: What are the Jets getting in rookie Brady Cook, who makes his NFL starting debut? At Missouri, he was known for his toughness.

Against Auburn last season, Cook injured an ankle on the opening drive, went to the hospital for an MRI and returned to lead two fourth-quarter touchdown drives in a 21-17 victory -- his signature game in college.

""He showed the type of leader he is, what he meant to our team,"" said tackle Armand Membou, a college teammate of Cook.

Cook becomes the first undrafted rookie in 50 years to start for the Jets.

6. Big (Apple) Turnover: The Jets have an inordinate number of pending free agents -- 22 of the 53 players on the current roster. They secured one potential free agent by signing center Josh Myers to a two-year, $11 million extension Friday. Four of their five starters on the offensive line are under contract for 2026. The Myers move likely means former center Joe Tippmann will remain at guard. Still unsigned for '26 are Breece Hall, Quincy Williams, Nick Folk and Alijah Vera-Tucker (injured reserve).

Yes, the revolving door will be spinning in the offseason.

7. Will they? The Jets must decide by May whether to exercise Will McDonald IV's fifth-year option for 2027, projected at $15 million. Once thought to be a no-brainer, this decision will require some careful thought.

McDonald probably will lead the team in sacks for the second straight year, but four of his seven came in one game. Consistency has been an issue, as most of his pass-rushing metrics are down from last season.

8. Lukewarm endorsement: One of the big moves last offseason was a three-year, $45 million extension for middle linebacker Jamien Sherwood, whom Glenn dubbed the quarterback of the defense. The returns haven't been stellar. Here's a brutally candid assessment by Wilks:

""I think, in my opinion, Sherwood is having a decent year. Up and down a little bit in regards to the tackling.""

9. What might have been: Facing Trevor Lawrence in a late-season game with no playoff implications will always conjure memories of the Jets' franchise-altering 23-20 victory on Dec. 20, 2020, over the Los Angeles Rams.

At 0-13, the Jets were on their way to the No. 1 pick in the 2021 draft -- Lawrence, the clear-cut top prospect. They went to Los Angeles a 17-point underdog, the second-largest spread in Jets history (second only to the 18-point spread in Super Bowl III).

Punter Braden Mann's touchdown-saving tackle on a fourth quarter return secured the win, allowing the Jaguars to leapfrog them in the draft order. A few days later, Mann told ESPN he received blowback on social media from angry Jets fans.

Lawrence has experienced his share of struggles over the years, but he has far outperformed the quarterback chosen No. 2 overall by the Jets -- Zach Wilson, who's on his third team.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1212%2Fr1588539_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 08:57:51.698472

Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell said Friday, Nov. 21, that LaPorta underwent back surgery and likely will miss the rest of the year, including Sunday's game against the L.A. Rams at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California..

“So look, Sam did have a procedure and he's going to be out for a while,” Campbell said during his press conference in Allen Park. “A while. I think we would be fortunate to have a chance to get him back for the rest of the season, at some point. I think that's very, very slim.”

LaPorta injured his back in the Lions’ Nov. 9 win over the Washington Commanders, was placed on injured reserve and missed a Nov. 16 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Brock Wright is recovering from a trachea injury and not expected back until the playoffs, and Shane Zylstra, out for weeks, was listed as questionable on Friday, and activated from IR on Saturday. He and Anthony Firkser – with two catches for 11 yards in three games – are the only tight ends on the Lions' 53-man roster entering Sunday's game.

As announced on Saturday afternoon, starting defensive lineman Tershawn Wharton has been added to the injury report for tomorrow’s matchup against the New Orleans Saints. Wharton is listed with a hamstring injury and is considered questionable.

Wharton has missed four games this season due to hamstring and toe injuries. He’s recorded 36 combined tackles and 2.0 sacks over his nine outings.

Prior to Wharton’s placement, the injury report featured five players—all of whom were cleared without game designations on Friday. The group includes center Cade Mays (ankle), inside linebackers Christian Rozeboom (hip/hamstring) and Claudin Cherelus (concussion), cornerback Jaycee Horn (concussion) and safety Lathan Ransom (thumb).

That timeframe would have him cleared for training camp next summer, ESPN is reporting.

Kirk Cousins tore his Achilles tendon in Week 8 of the 2023 season with the Vikings and was back on the field for training camp after signing with the Atlanta Falcons, nine months after the injury. It's unclear if he could have returned sooner -- as Jones will have to -- if he has suffered the injury later in the season.

The 2026 NFL season will start on Sept. 13 with training camp beginning in late July; a nine-month recovery would have put Jones back on the field for the end of the preseason.

Jones is a free agent after this season and that timeframe would be beneficial for negotiations with teams looking for a quarterback after his promising season with the Colts. Cousins, 35 at the time of his injury but with a longer track record than Jones, received a four-year, $180 million deal with a $50 million signing bonus and $100 million guaranteed after his torn Achilles tendon.

The Colts will reportedly start 44-year-old Philip Rivers in Jones' place Sunday in Seattle, according to media reports. Rivers, who hasn't played for 5 years, was signed earlier this week. Riley Leonard is expected to serve as his backup with Brett Rypien also on the 53-man roster.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/PIND/87657867007-2250558506.jpg?crop=3941,2218,x0,y205&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-14 05:58:13.626702

I knew his hands and ball skills were good and that he had route running ability.” ▪ Dolphins practice squad receiver A.J.","Except for safety Elijah Campbell, every player on the Dolphins’ 53-man roster will be available to play on Monday night at the Steelers, the team revealed after an evening practice in frigid Pittsburgh on Saturday night.

Among players on the 53-man roster, only Elijah Campbell has an injury designation; he is listed as doubtful with knee and ankle injuries.

Running back De’Von Achane, who missed the second half of the Jets game with injuries to multiple ribs, will play in Monday’s 8:15 p.m. game, which will air on ESPN and CBS-4 in South Florida.

Seven Dolphins players who were limited during Friday’s practice were able to practice fully on Saturday evening and are all set to play on Monday: Achane, center Aaron Brewer (ankle), cornerback Rasul Douglas (foot), safety Ifeatu Melifonwu (thumb/two groin muscles), outside linebacker Chop Robinson (oblique), tight end Darren Waller (rest), and long snapper Joe Cardona (hamstring).

Coach Mike McDaniel said center Andrew Meyer likely will not be activated before Monday’s game, though the team listed him as a questionable for the game. In order for Meyer to be eligible to play this season, the Dolphins must activate him by the Wednesday before the season finale at New England. He has been sidelined since the end of preseason with a triceps injury.

Meanwhile, Steelers star T.J. Watt is out after surgery on a partially collapsed lung.

Also out Monday: Steelers offensive lineman Adrus Peat (concussion) and cornerback James Pierre (calf).

Defensive tackle Derrick Harmon (knee) and tight end Darnell Washington (concussion) are questionable.

Night practice

Temperatures at kickoff are expected to be in the teens, but McDaniel said that wasn’t the driving force behind the decision to practice in Pittsburgh on Saturday evening.

“That’s something that we kind of considered in the offseason,” McDaniel said. “The odd part of a schedule is a Monday night on the road. It always feels like you’re so far removed from the last time you were on a football field. Doing it this way allows us our final full-speed practice about 48 hours from kickoff.”

He said acclimating to the weather is “an added bonus that we get to get ourselves into the environment. But realistically, that’s something we’ve been thinking about for a while to keep consistency 48 hours from kickoff having their last activity.”

League fines

The NFL fined Achane and Jaylen Wright for what it deemed a “violent gesture” in their celebration after Achane’s 13-yard touchdown run last Sunday against the Jets.

Achane was fined $8,238, while Wright was fined $6,388.

The Dolphins running backs become the latest among a handful of players who have been fined for a “nose wipe” gesture.

That gesture “has gang connotations; it’s disrespectful,” Troy Vincent, the NFL’s executive vice president of football operations, said in late March when the gesture was banned.

“It’s just where we are in society. Young men, they come from that era, from that age, and they’ve grown up on social media. If anybody Goggled ‘nose wipe,’ you’ll see the language that is used and where that’s affiliated. I think the players know better. I know they know better.”

Defensive line news

The Dolphins’ three rookie defense tackles - Kenneth Grant, Jordan Phillips and Zeek Biggers - have become competent NFL rotation players.

The question is whether more impact plays will follow. Grant has two tackles for loss all season and Phillips has just one. Do they need more of those to become very good defensive linemen?

No, defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver said.

“I don’t measure their success in tackles for loss,” Weaver said. “So much of what they do is unheralded and not on the stat sheet. A lot of the positive plays they have create positive plays for guys around them. A lot of people that benefit from selfless acts they do.”

Brooks and Dodson are so appreciative of the work of the defensive line that they’ve taken out the linemen for dinner on multiple occasions, Grant said.

They enjoy going to Capricco, an Italian restaurant in Pembroke Pines.

Grant says one goal is to generate more negative plays.

Weaver said the rookie defensive linemen are “absolutely” capable of that:

“That comes with football intelligence, gathering football information. You can actively see them calling out plays. Negative plays will come.”

Weaver said Phillips “has been pretty solid for the bulk of the year. Early on he was hanging on blocks too long when there was opportunity to make plays. He remedied that.

“Kenneth turned the page that Cleveland game. Once we got to that Cleveland week and that week of practice, I was like, ‘All right, I think the light switch might have gone off,’ and I don’t ever see that going backwards.”

Grant said he has improved in the area of watching film - and knowing what to look for - by watching Zach Sieler and Benito Jones and taking coaching from Austin Clark.

“I’ve become a better film studier,” he said. “In college, you watch film, but there’s a different way you watch film in the league. Watching how Zach watches film, I try to create that for myself.”

It has helped him learn “a team’s favorite runs and their tendencies.”

This and that

McDaniel on Saturday raved about tight end Greg Dulcich, a capable blocker who has become an asset in the passing game in recent weeks. He had three receptions for 41 yards against the Jets last week.

“Greg has been a very pleasant surprise just in general because you typically don’t have a guy assimilate as fast as he has and that’s a credit to him and ‘Embo’ [Jon Embree] and Frank Smith and Bobby Slowik,” McDaniel said.

“He is very good football player with the nuances of getting leverage on defenders, how to be able to separate from them with an understanding of the timing of the play. Then he is a tough guy to tackle. I knew his hands and ball skills were good and that he had route running ability.”

▪ Dolphins practice squad receiver A.J. Henning on Monday will serve the second game of a two-game suspension for violating the league’s policy on performance enhancing substances.

Robinson has missed the past seven games due to a foot injury and Washington is set to make his season debut after suffering an Achilles injury in May.

Robinson led the Ravens with two sacks before going down, and his return adds more bite to the defensive front in tandem with defensive end Dre'Mont Jones.

""Recovery timeline is still TBD, but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today,"" J.J. wrote Dec. 12. ""He and his family are very appreciative of everyone’s kind words and well wishes.""

Pneumothorax, or a punctured lung, is a possible result of dry needling, though very rare.

Dry needling refers to a form of physical therapy with large needles designed to stimulate blood flow around muscular and soft tissue injures. Former Packers employee and NFL commentator Andrew Brandt said it's common for players to receive treatment at their own facilities.

""For insertion around chest, there is some risk of pneumothorax that needs to be fully explained before treatment,"" Brandt wrote.

T.J., who was not on the injury report prior to the development, won't play Dec. 15 on Monday Night Football when the Steelers face the Dolphins and presumably will be lost for multiple weeks. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network posted Dec. 12 that Watt was expected to play again this season.

ESPN reported that the NFL Players Association had been in touch with Watt over the incident. ""Our main immediate priority is supporting T.J.'s health and full recovery,"" the NFLPA said in a statement.

Watt, 31, who has been named a Pro Bowler each of the past seven years and received top-five standing in the defensive player of the year voting in five of those years, may not have the numbers that match his recent production but remains a difference maker. In 13 games this season, he has seven sacks, two fumble recoveries, three forced fumbles, seven passes defended and an interception, with 10 tackles for loss and 18 quarterback hits.

Watt played football at Pewaukee High School and became an All-American linebacker at the University of Wisconsin. He momentarily became the highest paid non-quarterback in NFL history with a three-year, $123 million contract extension before the year.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/11/USAT/87718516007-usatsi-27764683.jpg?crop=5994,3372,x5,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-14 11:03:42.465559

Commanders star quarterback Jayden Daniels will return to the bench after re-aggravating a previous injury, while the Jets and the Raiders will roll out backup signal-callers.

Elsewhere, two star wide receivers face concerns stemming from concussions, with Cowboys wideout CeeDee Lamb poised to play and Bengals receiver Tee Higgins set to miss his second game in the past three weeks.

See who's in and who's out for Week 15:

QB Jayden Daniels (Commanders)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Elbow

Daniels will miss the Commanders' Week 15 game against the Giants. He returned from a four-game absence last week but re-aggravated his left elbow injury and will return to the bench. It's his seventh absence of an injury-riddled season. With Washington (3-10) not having much to play for, it'll opt for caution with its franchise quarterback. That said, veteran Marcus Mariota will make his seventh start of the season.

QB Tyrod Taylor (Jets)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Groin

Taylor will miss the Jets' Week 15 game against the Jaguars with a groin injury. In four games as a starter this season, he has led the Jets to a 1-3 record. With Taylor out, undrafted rookie Brady Cook will make his first NFL start.

QB Geno Smith (Raiders)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Shoulder/Back

Smith will miss his first game of the season when the Raiders face the Eagles in Week 15. In 13 starts this season, Smith has thrown for 2,648 yards, 16 touchdowns and a league-high 14 interceptions. Las Vegas (2-11) is currently tied for the worst record in the league. Backup Kenny Pickett will start in Smith's place.

WR Tee Higgins (Bengals)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-DNP

Injury: Concussion

Higgins will miss the Bengals' Week 15 game against the Ravens. He sustained a concussion in Week 14 after returning from that same injury the week prior. Surprisingly, Higgins returned to practice in a limited fashion on Wednesday and Thursday, leaving hope that he could return later this season. Sunday will mark Higgins' second absence of the season — both against Baltimore. In 12 games, he has 46 catches for 667 yards and nine touchdowns.

WR Rome Odunze (Bears)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Foot

Odunze will carry a questionable tag into the Bears' Week 15 game against the Browns. He has been dealing with a stress fracture in his foot for the past few weeks, and it kept him out of a game for the first time this season last week. After a week of rest, however, he could return to the field to help Chicago in its fight for the NFC North after losing the division lead to the Packers last week. After a hot start to the season, Odunze has struggled since getting injured, hauling in just 13 catches for 188 yards and one touchdown over the past five weeks.

TE David Njoku (Browns)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Knee

Njoku will miss the Browns' Week 15 game against the Bears. He sustained a knee injury catching a touchdown — his only catch of the game — from quarterback Shedeur Sanders in Week 14. Njoku has 33 catches for 293 yards and four touchdowns under his belt so far this season. With Njoku out of the lineup, rookie Harold Fannin Jr. will have the tight end snaps all to himself and will look to continue to build on an impressive season.

RB Josh Jacobs (Packers)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-Limited

Injury: Knee

Jacobs will carry a questionable tag into the Packers' Week 16 game against the Broncos. He has played through lower body injuries throughout this season and might try to do the same against this week. Despite the minor injuries stacking up, Jacobs has totaled 817 rushing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns in 12 games this season.

RB Christian McCaffrey (49ers)

Practice schedule: DNP-Limited-Full

Injury: Illness/Back

McCaffrey will carry a questionable tag into the 49ers' Week 15 game against the Titans. He missed Wednesday's practice with an illness before returning Thursday. He was upgraded to a full participant on Friday. However, on Saturday, he was added to the injury report with a back issue, so his status for the game is once again up in the air.

WR CeeDee Lamb (Cowboys)

Practice schedule: Limited-Full-Full

Injury: Concussion

Lamb will be active for the Cowboys' Week 15 game against the Vikings on Sunday night. He sustained a concussion that forced him out of the team's bout with the Lions in Week 14, but 10 days off helped him not miss time. It's crucial that the Cowboys have their top pass-catcher this weekend, as they're fighting for a playoff spot.

McCaffrey should be good to go for the San Francisco 49ers' game against the Tennessee Titans despite being deemed questionable on Saturday afternoon due to a back injury, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported, per a source.

CMC sat out Wednesday's practice while dealing with an illness and was limited Thursday, through he initially went into the weekend without a designation following a full session Friday.

Given San Francisco's extensive injury history this season, a back issue popping up for McCaffrey likely raised some alarm bells among fans.

While key offense players such as Brock Purdy, George Kittle, Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall have all been absent at different points of the year, McCaffrey has remained as a constant, keeping the Niners moving toward a potential playoff berth despite all the missing pieces.

He's logged a league-leading 322 touches for San Francisco, turning workhorse usage into 849 rushing yards, 806 receiving yards and 13 total touchdowns. He's both the team's leading rusher and receiver by a wide margin.

Thankfully, he's expected to remain in the fold Sunday.

If McCaffrey's back gives him any trouble during the game -- or even if all systems are a go -- the 49ers could still presumably play it smart with their star running back. He entered Week 15 as the only player in the NFL with 300 or more touches, currently averaging 24.8 per game.

The Niners are in the stretch run now, in playoff position with an outside shot (10%) at winning the NFC West. While it'd be unwise to take the 2-11 Tennessee Titans lightly, it's also important McCaffrey remains upright for upcoming games against the Colts, Bears and Seahawks, plus a hopeful postseason run.

Should McCaffrey take a few less snaps, Brian Robinson will be first up to step in.

The Dallas Cowboys receiver was injured during last week's loss to the Detroit Lions when he went up for a deep pass in the end zone and was contorting his body trying to make a one-handed catch. He couldn't make the catch and then landed hard and his head slammed on the ground.

Lamb returned to practice as a full participant on Thursday as his recovery has gone well enough for him to return for Sunday Night Football.

""Process has been cool. Obviously, it's been a lot of eye work and eye discipline and trying to, I guess, frustrate myself essentially to see if I have any more residuals of the concussion. And I haven't had any type of symptoms,"" Lamb said. ""As for me now, it's been heavy on rest, to be honest. Doing everything, me knowing my requirements, kind of getting ahead of everything, especially with the extra 2-3 days that we had off. I feel like that was big.""

The San Francisco 49ers added Christian McCaffrey to the injury report on Saturday with a back injury. The running back did not practice Wednesday and was limited Thursday due to an illness before being a full participant on Friday.

There's no word on the severity of McCaffrey's back issue ahead of Sunday's meeting with the Tennessee Titans. Despite the injury report addition, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports that the 49ers star is expected to be ""good to go.""

[NFL injury updates live]

Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt had successful surgery to ""stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung,"" according to his brother J.J.

Watt was in a dry needling treatment session at the team's practice facility on Wednesday when he started to feel discomfort. There is no timeline for a recovery, but was released from the hospital on Friday and will not play Monday night against the Miami Dolphins.

Other notable Week 15 injuries:

Cincinnati Bengals receiver Tee Higgins has been ruled out for Sunday's matchup with the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion. Higgins missed Week 13 with a concussion and found himself back in protocol this week after getting injured last week against the Buffalo Bills. Higgins was evaluated in-game and cleared to return, but Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said Monday that the receiver was back in protocol. He was limited during Thursday's practice and ultimately ruled out Friday afternoon.

The Washington Commanders have already ruled quarterback Jayden Daniels out for Week 15 due to aggravating an elbow injury in Week 14's loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Daniels had just returned from a three-game absence after dislocating that elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. Marcus Mariota will start his seventh game this season when the Commanders face the New York Giants on Sunday.

Trey Benson will not return this season after the Arizona Cardinals chose not to activate him from injured reserve during his 21-day practice window. The running back has been out since Week 4 with a knee injury. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Benson had not progressed enough to warrant a return this season.

Injuries to his right shoulder and back will sideline Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Geno Smith for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Kenny Pickett has been taking first-team reps this week and will start as head coach Pete Carroll called Smith ""day-to-day.""

Cardinals at Texans (1 p.m.
Dolphins at Steelers (8:15 p.m.","We've reached Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season, and while some teams aim to make late-season pushes into the postseason, others are keeping one eye on the upcoming NFL Draft and the other on their roster to see which players should and shouldn't return. Making things more complicated at this stage of the year is injuries, and there are quite a few notable ones for bettors to know for Week 15. Here's a breakdown of the most important injuries of Week 15, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff. All times Eastern.

Ravens at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)

CIN WR Tee Higgins (concussion, out)

Star Cincinnati receiver Tee Higgins is out this week with his second concussion of 2025, both of which have occurred over the last month. The Ravens need a win to try and keep pace with Pittsburgh for the division lead after dropping two games in a row to fall to 6-7.

The Ravens are 2.5-point favorites, while the total is very high at 51.5.

Raiders at Eagles (1 p.m. ET)

LV QB Geno Smith (right shoulder and back, out)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, out)

Kenny Pickett will be under center for the Raiders against his old team,as the former first-round pick will start in place of the injured Geno Smith, who's dealing with shoulder and back injuries. The Eagles will again be without star tackle Lane Johnson, which is bad news against Maxx Crosby.

Vegas is a 12.5-point underdog here, with the total at just 38.5.

Cardinals at Texans (1 p.m. ET)

AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, out)

HOU RB Nick Chubb (ribs, questionable)

Marvin Harrison Jr. headlines another lengthy injury list for the Cardinals, who have lost five in a row and are just 3-10 on the year. The Texans are on the opposite end of the spectrum, having won five in a row, but they may be without veteran running back Nick Chubb as he's questionable to play against a lackluster Arizona defense.

Houston is a 9.5-point favorite, and the total sits at 42.5.

Chargers at Chiefs (1 p.m. ET)

LAC WR Quentin Johnston (groin, questionable)

KC WR Hollywood Brown (personal, out)

KC OL Trey Smith and Jawaan Taylor (out)

The Chargers aren't the only AFC West team with issues on the offensive line, as two Kansas City starters are out for this matchup on Sunday. The Chiefs will also be without veteran receiver Hollywood Brown in this must-win matchup, while the Chargers have listed receiver Quentin Johnston as questionable.

Kansas City is a 6-point favorite, and the total is 40.5.

Bills at Patriots (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Arguably the game of the week sees the Bills visit the Patriots in an AFC East clash. New England has won 10 in a row after a 1-2 start and is aiming to spoil the Bills' bid to win the division for the sixth year in a row.

Buffalo is favored by 1.5, and the total is 49.5.

Jets at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)

NYJ QB Tyrod Taylor (groin, out)

NYJ QB Justin Fields (knee, out)

NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)

A weird season for the Jets will be made even weirder this weekend with undrafted rookie Brady Cook starting at quarterback with both Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields out. Cook completed 14 of his 30 attempts last week in relief of an injured Taylor, and he won't have reliable tight end Mason Taylor to throw to in this matchup with the AFC South-leading Jaguars.

Jacksonville is favored by 13.5. The total is 41.5.

Commanders at Giants (1 p.m. ET)

WASH QB Jayden Daniels (left elbow, out)

WASH WR Deebo Samuel (illness, questionable)

WASH RB Chris Rodriguez (groin, questionable)

The Commanders' offense is beat up with Jayden Daniels ruled out after returning last week only to get knocked out once again. Marcus Mariota will start, and it's unclear if he'll have Deebo Samuel to throw to as the veteran receiver is questionable with an illness. Washington mixes up its running back rotation quite a bit, and Chris Rodriguez is also questionable.

The Giants are 2.5-point favorites, and the total is 46.5.

Browns at Bears (1 p.m. ET)

CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)

CLE RB Dylan Sampson (calf and hand, out)

CLE CB Denzel Ward (calf, out)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, questionable)

Cleveland will be down two weapons on offense with veteran tight end David Njoku and rookie running back Dylan Sampson both ruled out. Top cornerback Denzel Ward is also out for the Browns' elite defense. For Chicago, the Bears are hoping to get receiver Rome Odunze back for this matchup after he missed last week's loss to Green Bay.

Chicago is favored by 7.5, and the total is 38.5.

Panthers at Saints (4:25 p.m. ET)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)

The main injury here is that the Saints will be without top running back Alvin Kamara once again. The veteran is out with knee and ankle injuries in this divisional clash with the Panthers, who can take first place in the NFC South with a win thanks to Tampa Bay's loss on Thursday.

Carolina is a 2.5-point favorite, and the total is 40.5.

Lions at Rams (4:25 p.m. ET)

DET S Brian Branch and Kerby Joseph (out)

LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, questionable)

This massive NFC clash sees the Lions again dealing with major injuries on defense, and that's especially true in the secondary as both of the team's starting safeties are out. The Rams expect Davante Adams to play, but he is questionable with a nagging hamstring injury.

The Rams are 6-point favorites while the total is the highest of the Week 15 slate at 54.5.

Colts at Seahawks (4:25 p.m. ET)

IND QB Riley Leonard (knee, will be active)

IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, out)

The big story here is who will start at quarterback for the Colts. Daniel Jones tore his Achilles last week and is out for the year, so Indianapolis signed Philip Rivers, who last played in 2020, to the practice squad. Rookie Riley Leonard played in place of Jones last week and also suffered an injury, but he'll be active in Seattle. Whether he starts is another question altogether. Defensively, the Colts will be down star cornerback Sauce Gardner against the Seahawks' high-flying offense.

The Seahawks are 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.

Packers at Broncos (4:25 p.m. ET)

GB RB Josh Jacobs (knee, questionable)

The Packers and Broncos square off in what very well could be a Super Bowl preview on Sunday, and Green Bay is hoping to have its top running back on the field as Josh Jacobs is questionable. If he can't go, Emanuel Wilson would serve as lead back as third-string back MarShawn Lloyd has been ruled out.

Denver is a 2.5-point favorite at home. The total is 42.5.

Titans at 49ers (4:25 p.m. ET)

SF RB Christian McCaffrey (back, questionable)

Star 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey was added to the injury report on Saturday with a back injury ahead of Sunday's matchup with Tennessee. This would leave Brian Robinson as San Francisco's lead back should McCaffrey be inactive.

San Francisco is favored by 12.5 while the total sits at 44.5.

Vikings at Cowboys (8:20 p.m. ET)

DAL TE Jake Ferguson (calf, questionable)

It looks like Dallas' offense will be at full strength, which wasn't a certainty entering the week. Star receiver CeeDee Lamb cleared concussion protocol and will suit up this week, while tight end Jake Ferguson is expecting to play on Sunday despite being listed as questionable.

Dallas is favored by 5.5 points. The total is 48.5.

Dolphins at Steelers (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)

Star Pittsburgh edge rusher T.J. Watt won't suit up this week after he suffered a collapsed lung that required surgery after a dry needling treatment. It's unclear if or when Watt will return this season for the AFC North-leading Steelers.

The Steelers are 3-point favorites at home. The total is 42.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/22/9ba602fb-8eab-4ec3-be43-adfc80417a80/thumbnail/1200x675/f9c3e1e60c2462860b5a7e4bbbd35eae/jayden-daniels.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 23:58:09.646992

Packers practice squad elevations by week","The Green Bay Packers added running back Emanuel Wilson to the injury report with an illness and elevated running back Pierre Strong Jr. from the practice squad to the gameday roster on Saturday. Strong is now available to coach Matt LaFleur for Sunday's showdown with the Denver Broncos.

Wilson is listed as questionable to play. So is starting running back Josh Jacobs, who only practiced once this week because of recurring swelling and stiffness in his injured knee. The only healthy running back on the 53-man roster for the Packers is Chris Brooks, making Strong a necessary elevation for Sunday against the Denver Broncos.

Wilson, if available, would be looking at an increased role at running back and a potential start in place of Jacobs. But with his status now in question, the Packers may need to scramble at the position before facing the NFL's No. 1 ranked defense against the run.

Brooks is a capable blocker and receiver who has played in all 13 games for the Packers this season. Strong, a fourth-round pick in the 2022 NFL draft, has played in 46 career games. His 125 career touches have gained 692 yards, and he's also returned 24 career kickoffs.

The Packers previously elevated Strong in Week 7 and Week 12 (when Jacobs was out). He was not active for either game. Strong is now out of elevations from the practice squad.

The belief still is that Jones will play next year in Indianapolis, but his contract expires after this season and he is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

A training camp return would be an aggressive timeline for Jones, but the Colts think it's possible -- and this thinking is going to inform their offseason approach to free agency, a team source told ESPN's Stephen Holder. Indianapolis is expected to have a better idea of Jones' progress by April.

Jones and the Colts did not have any discussions about an extension while the quarterback was having a resurgent season and leading Indianapolis to the top of the AFC South. Last Sunday, Jones fell to the ground, slammed his helmet in frustration and knew that he had torn his Achilles -- before the MRI even confirmed it.

Both Jones and the Colts, who were highly pleased with each other, have significant decisions to make. Jones is expected to be interested in returning to Indianapolis, but he also could have other options. The Colts are expected to try to re-sign Jones, but the question will be the cost.

The Colts could opt to use the franchise tag on Jones, which is expected to come in around $45 million to $46 million this offseason, according to league sources.

But for now, Jones' focus will be on recovering from the Achilles surgery and getting ready for the 2026 season.

Jones has demonstrated the ability to be a quick healer in the past. While playing quarterback for the New York Giants in 2023, Jones tore his ACL but returned for the start of the 2024 season.

Jones underwent surgery Tuesday after rupturing his Achilles tendon in Sunday's 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars and was ruled out for the season. Jones was also dealing with a fractured fibula and a calf injury before he suffered the Achilles injury.

Before going down, Jones was having a career season in his first year with the Colts. He threw for 3,101 yards, 19 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. Jones was just 104 yards short of his career-high for passing yards and six touchdowns away from his personal best in passing touchdowns.

Despite the change in scenario, injuries have continued to plague the 28-year-old quarterback. Jones has not missed an entire season in his career. He played in 16 games in 2022, resting only during the final week to prepare for the playoffs.

Jones spent his first six seasons with the New York Giants before being released and signing with the Minnesota Vikings midway through last season. This offseason, he signed a one-year, $14 million contract and ultimately won the starting job over Anthony Richardson. Jones will be a free agent after this season.

Rookie quarterback Riley Leonard finished the game for the Colts, throwing for 145 yards and one interception. Leonard, who dealt with a knee injury earlier this week in practice, was cleared to play on Sunday.

Cook was Mizzou’s starting quarterback from 2022-24.","Former Missouri football quarterback Brady Cook is set to make his first professional start.

New York Jets starting quarterback Justin Fields has been ruled out of the team’s game Sunday, Dec. 14, against the Jacksonville Jaguars with a knee injury, and backup Tyrod Taylor will miss the matchup with a groin injury.

That means Cook, who played for the Jets in relief after Taylor was injured in a 34-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins this past Saturday, has been elevated to the starting role. His backup will be former Kansas State QB Adrian Martinez.

""Brady will be our starting quarterback this week,"" Jets head coach Aaron Glenn told reporters this week. ""He's gotten all the reps with the ones, and Adrian (Martinez) will be our backup.""

Cook went 14-of-30 passing for 163 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions against the Dolphins. He entered the game with the Jets already trailing 21-0.

The Jets will play Jacksonville at noon CT on Sunday in Jacksonville, where Mizzou, coincidentally, will play its bowl game later this month.

“It was just a tough situation for him, not getting a chance to get all the reps,"" Glenn said. ""But now, this week, he's had a chance to get all the reps with (the) ones, get a chance to communicate with the O-line, with the receivers, with the tight ends, with the coaching staff on exactly how we want to go about playing this game.”

Added Glenn: “I have all the confidence in the world. That's something I've stated from the very beginning. (Cook will) be a good player in this league, and he'll have his opportunity again this week.""

The Jets signed Cook as an undrafted free agent shortly after the 2024 NFL Draft.

Cook was Mizzou’s starting quarterback from 2022-24. The St. Louis native and Chaminade grad won 26 games as Mizzou’s starter over those three seasons, helping Missouri record back-to-back double-digit win years in 2023 and 2024.

The quarterback will play alongside former MU teammate and right tackle Armand Membou, who was drafted with the No. 7 overall pick by the Jets and has started every game this season.

Cook registered more than 10,000-career all-purpose yards, which ranks fourth all-time at Missouri. With 9,013 career passing yards, he ranks third all-time in the category at Mizzou. He is the only MU quarterback in program history with more than 9,000 passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards.

The quarterback’s best season with the Tigers came in 2023, when he threw for 255.2 yards per game and 21 touchdowns and five interceptions in 13 starts. He also rushed for 319 yards and eight scores.

Cook appeared in 46 total games for Mizzou with 39 starts. He passed for 49 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.

""I've been nervous before any football game I've ever played. I'm excited. It's important,"" Cook told reporters this week. ""This is everything I've ever done. So, there's a level of importance there that it's going to create nerves. But whenever I (run) out onto the field and take that first snap, it's gone.

After suffering a torn Achilles tendon in the playoffs last season, Tatum began an arduous rehab journey that was expected to hold him out for the entire year. However, he appears to be well ahead of schedule when it comes to his injury rehab, and reports indicate he wants to play this season.

Given how frequently fans have seen Tatum getting work in on the court as late, some folks believe it’s a matter of when, not if, he returns to action this year. However, according to one team insider, it sounds like the C’s still intend on proceeding with caution when it comes to their franchise player.

“Within the organization he continues to indicate that he would like to return this season,” Adam Himmelsbach of The Boston Globe reported. “It probably falls somewhere between possible and likely, but a league source stressed that the team remains several steps away from even considering the decision.

Tatum must still reach several mile markers in his recovery before discussions about a return can be considered.”

Considering how well Boston has played to begin the year, getting Tatum back could instantly make the team a legit title contender. The team isn’t losing sight of its long-term future, though, which could ultimately lead to him being held out for the entire year.

In last week's loss to the Denver Broncos, Smith suffered a right shoulder injury, which will keep him out of Sunday's road matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles (1 p.m. ET / Fox).

Before Smith's injury, his production hadn't met his or the team's expectations when the 35-year-old signal-caller was traded from the Seattle Seahawks in the offseason. Through 13 games, Smith has thrown for 2,648 yards with 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. He also has a completion rate of 67% and a QBR of 32.5 -- ranked 30th in the league.

Here's everything you need to know about the Raiders' quarterback situation ahead of Week 15's contest.

Who's next up at quarterback for Las Vegas?

Backup Kenny Pickett is set to make his second start in two seasons, and he said it's a ""great opportunity"" to face the Eagles.

Pickett received valuable first-team reps throughout the week, with the expectation that he will take Smith's place. Aidan O'Connell, who has been the team's emergency third quarterback in recent weeks, will be the primary backup.

Raiders coach Pete Carroll called Pickett an athletic player and a good thinker. Carroll added that he has coached ""the hell out of him"" so that Pickett would be ready whenever an opportunity to play emerged.

""This is exactly how we did it with Geno for years [in Seattle],"" Carroll said. ""And however long it takes for the opportunity, he's going to be ready to go.""

In extended playing time against the Broncos, Pickett impressed the coaching staff. He completed 8 of 11 passes for 97 yards and a touchdown in the fourth quarter of the Raiders' 24-17 loss.

Pickett completed six straight passes, including a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Shedrick Jackson. Pickett was 4-of-4 with 83 yards on attempts for 10-plus air yards.

""He managed it in a very difficult situation,"" interim offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Greg Olson said. ""He had two two-minute situations and scored 10 points. So, it was good to see.""

Olson admired Pickett's mobility, which allowed him to extend plays. The Raiders hope to use this skill set to their advantage Sunday.

""Even in college, he did a lot of things there with his legs,"" Olson said. ""So, he gives us that part of his game, maybe, not that Geno isn't mobile, but the ability to escape and run and create and do some of those things.

""... We expect that going forward.""

Pickett was traded from the Cleveland Browns before the start of the season after O'Connell fractured his wrist in the Raiders' preseason finale against the Arizona Cardinals. At the time, the Raiders were searching for an experienced veteran to fill the backup position, and Pickett fit the mold.

Pickett has played for four teams since he was drafted in the first round by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2022.

After two seasons with the Steelers, Pickett was traded to the Eagles last offseason and played behind Jalen Hurts. The Browns traded a 2025 fifth-round pick and quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson for Pickett in March.

Pickett was competing to be the Browns' starter but didn't play in the preseason after injuring his hamstring in practice July 26.

In 33 career games (25 starts), Pickett has thrown for 4,870 yards, 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions while completing 62.4% of his pass attempts. He is 15-10 as a starter.

""He's been actively taking charge when he gets the opportunities in practice, and we put him in a lot of competitive situations to try to force him to the front,"" Carroll said. ""... He's as ready as a guy can be that hasn't done much playing.""

How long is Smith expected to be out?

Carroll said Smith is on the right track after receiving treatment throughout the week. Carroll added that there's a ""really good chance"" that Smith will be available for next week's matchup against the Houston Texans on the road.

Carroll stated Wednesday that health will be the only reason that Smith will remain sidelined, despite Smith's inconsistent on-field production.

Smith is also dealing with a lower back injury that has been concerning for the two-time Pro Bowl QB, Carroll said. Smith has been in and out of the training facility throughout the week to get tested. But Carroll sounded optimistic about Smith's right shoulder.

""He hasn't thrown this week very much, but it's manageable,"" Carroll said.

What this means for the Raiders' matchup against the Eagles

The Raiders hope Pickett could help snap their seven-game losing streak while extending Philadelphia's skid to four games.

Pickett will have tight end Michael Mayer and rookie wide receiver Dont'e Thornton Jr. back in the lineup after both players missed last week's game because of injuries.

The Eagles' offense has struggled in recent weeks (averaging 16.2 points in the past five games), which could open the door for Las Vegas to potentially steal a road win. At the same time, it will come down to how well the offensive line holds up against the Eagles' defensive front.

Las Vegas ranks 21st in pass block win rate (59.6%) and run block win rate (70.5%).

Due to the expected snowy and cold weather conditions in Philadelphia, the Raiders could rely heavily on rookie running back Ashton Jeanty, even though his production has been inconsistent for most of the season.

The Eagles are 26th in rushing yards allowed (132 per game) but have given up 450 yards in the past two games.

If the Raiders can be impactful in the run game, that should take a bit of pressure off Pickett.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1212%2Fr1588515_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 03:59:11.803607

McCaffrey logged a full practice on Friday after an illness hindered his availability to participate earlier in the week. Him not being on the initial injury report Friday brought a sigh of relief to San Francisco, but a new back injury might bring a bigger concern.

McCaffrey leads the team in both rushing (849) and receiving yards (806) while also generating the most touchdowns (13) for the Niners. Being without their workhorse RB might not be so crucial against a two-win Titans team on Sunday but there's cause for concern should the back injury linger down the final stretch.

Brian Robinson portends to get more snaps with McCaffrey ailing or especially if he is unable to suit up Sunday. Robinson has averaged 4.6 yards per carry in his role as the No. 2 backfield option.

It also is likely the next step toward an offseason divorce between the Niners and Aiyuk.
That took place in the summer because Aiyuk missed team rehabilitation sessions for his injured right knee.
As recently as early December, general manager John Lynch expressed some hope Aiyuk might practice but acknowledged it was increasingly a long shot.

That designation, which is generally used for players who intend either to retire or to temporarily step away from football, means Aiyuk is ineligible to play for the 49ers in 2025. Aiyuk, who has been recovering from a torn ACL, MCL and meniscus in his right knee, has not been seen around the facility in recent weeks, and his placement on the list suggests he hasn't been around the team or participating in rehab sessions.

It also is likely the next step toward an offseason divorce between the Niners and Aiyuk. On Thursday, Niners tight end George Kittle hinted that Aiyuk wasn't likely to be back.

""At this point, it doesn't seem like he's coming back,"" Kittle said. ""I try my best to not even think about it because I love Brandon. He's one of my favorite teammates I've played with.

So, if I think about the 'I wish he'd be here,' it kind of just makes me sad.""

The extent of the discord between the sides became public late last month when it was revealed that the Niners had voided roughly $27 million in guarantees Aiyuk had in his contract for 2026. That took place in the summer because Aiyuk missed team rehabilitation sessions for his injured right knee.

Before Saturday, Aiyuk had spent this season on the physically unable to perform list because of the knee injury, with the Niners hoping that somewhere along the way they could open his 21-day practice window and potentially get him back on the field.

Coach Kyle Shanahan said early in the season the hope was to get Aiyuk back practicing sometime around midseason.

As recently as early December, general manager John Lynch expressed some hope Aiyuk might practice but acknowledged it was increasingly a long shot.

""[Is it] realistic? I'm not sure,"" Lynch told KNBR radio on Dec. 2. ""Hopeful? Yeah. I think that's where I'd leave that ... We're a better football team when Brandon is out there, but that's probably what it is. Hope.""

After signing a four-year, $120 million contract extension with the Niners in August 2024 following contentious negotiations, Aiyuk injured his knee on Oct. 20, 2024. He had surgery the following month and has been working his way back since.

Now, the Niners and Aiyuk are likely to part ways this offseason with a decision still to be made on how that will happen.

Since the 49ers voided his future guarantees, they would take on a nearly $30 million dead money cap charge if they released him in the offseason. They could also designate him a post-June 1 release to eat $13.325 million in dead money next year and the rest in 2027. The same numbers would apply if the Niners were able to trade Aiyuk.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0903%2Fr1381630_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 22:00:13.843996

Yet, a league source said the issue didn’t seem like anything that would keep the running back out of Sunday’s game against the Tennessee Titans.

It’s been an odd week for McCaffrey. He had his usual “veteran” day off Wednesday, then missed most of Thursday’s session due to an illness. He practiced in full on Friday, with Kyle Shanahan saying McCaffrey would be a full-go for the game. Then on Saturday, McCaffrey reported having a minor issue with his back. The team usually holds a walk-through practice on Saturdays.

If his back were to worsen and he couldn’t play, Brian Robinson Jr. would get his first start of the season, backup Isaac Guerendo likely would see his first carries of 2025 and fourth-round draft pick Jordan James would be activated for the first time.

Their lack of usage speaks to McCaffrey’s health in 2025. He popped up on the injury report in Week 1 with a calf strain, but ended up starting that game and every one since. He leads the league in touches (322) and is third behind the Atlanta Falcons’ Bijan Robinson and the Indianapolis Colts’ Jonathan Taylor in scrimmage yards.

He’s also on pace to become the first player to have two seasons of 1,000-plus rushing and 1,000-plus receiving yards, having first accomplished the feat in 2019 when he was with the Carolina Panthers. At his current pace, he’d finish with 1,110 rushing yards and 1,054 receiving yards.

While the 49ers have been healthy at running back, the linebacker position has grown thin. The team will be without Fred Warner (ankle), Tatum Bethune (high ankle) and Eric Kendricks (calf) against the Titans. The 49ers elevated linebacker Jalen Graham and defensive tackle Sebastian Valdez from the practice squad.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/13172032/McCaffreyback-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-13 20:00:30.447880

Gordon missed the first four games because of a hamstring injury and five more because of a groin issue before returning for Chicago’s win at Philadelphia in Week 13. A second-round draft pick by the Bears in 2022, he has five career interceptions.

Chicago (9-4) elevated running back Brittain Brown and linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin from the practice squad for Sunday’s game against Cleveland (3-10).

WR Rashod Bateman, Baltimore | Ankle | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

Rashod Bateman was added to Thursday's injury report with an ankle injury. While it's unclear whether this is the same ankle issue that caused him to miss Weeks 11 and 12, that appears likely given that he did not practice on Friday.

At this point, Bateman seems to be on the wrong side of questionable heading into the weekend.

WR Quentin Johnston, LA Chargers | Groin | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

Quentin Johnston was a late addition to the injury report, a trend you never want to see. He did not practice on Friday due to a groin injury, and assuming this is a new issue, it's unlikely Johnston will play in Week 14.

Groin injuries can be particularly limiting for wide receivers, given the demands of cutting and acceleration. Until Johnston can log at least a limited practice, his availability remains in serious doubt.

WR Rome Odunze, Chicago | Foot | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

The Rome Odunze situation is difficult to assess. While it's unclear how long Odunze has been dealing with the stress fracture in his foot, after sitting out Week 14, it's fair to question how much true healing could have occurred in just one week. Odunze was limited all week, but there does appear to be some optimism that he will play.

Whether he should play is the next question, and whether fantasy managers should trust him is another. Foot injuries are difficult for any athlete, especially NFL wide receivers who rely on explosion and sharp cutting. Even if Odunze suits up, I recommend leaving him out of fantasy lineups this week.

Gordon has been limited to three games this season while dealing with multiple soft tissue injuries.

To make room, the Cardinals placed defensive lineman Bilal Nichols on IR with a knee injury, officially ending a second straight frustrating season for the veteran.

Jones, a 2024 fifth-round draft pick, has been plagued by preseason injuries in both his NFL seasons. As a rookie, he spent most of the season on IR with an ankle injury. This year, it was a knee injury that landed him on the sideline. With Johnson hurting his knee last week against the Rams, Kelvin Beachum is expected to start at right tackle and rookie Josh Fryar at left tackle.

The Cardinals, with multiple wide receiver injuries, will also elevate wide receivers Trent Sherfield Sr. and Jalen Brooks from the practice squad for a second straight game.

Nichols signed a three-year free-agent contract in 2024, and hadn't missed a game up until that point in four NFL seasons. But last season he played just six games because of a serious neck injury. That rehab lasted into this season. He finally came off IR but appeared in just four games, missing one for the birth of his child and becoming a healthy scratch in a couple of others. He hurt his knee against the Rams and was already deemed out for Sunday's game.

Despite the questionable designation, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter that McCaffrey is expected to be ""good to go"" against Tennessee.

As the Niners returned from their bye this week, McCaffrey said he was ""rested and recovered"" on Wednesday, taking his usual veteran's rest that day. He then was limited in practice on Thursday with an illness but was a full participant in Friday's practice, which is more of a walk-through.

""I know he wasn't feeling well, but he looked good today,"" coach Kyle Shanahan said on Friday.

That seems to indicate the back issue flared up either after Friday's practice or sometime Saturday. McCaffrey has not missed a game this season after he was limited to just four contests in 2024 because of Achilles and knee injuries.

If McCaffrey were unable to go, Brian Robinson would step into the starting running back role with Isaac Guerendo and rookie Jordan James available as potential backups. Guerendo has been limited to special teams only, taking zero offensive snaps, and James has yet to be active in a game this season.

""Brian to me, like his last seven games have probably been his best game seven times in a row,"" Shanahan said Friday when asked why James has yet to be active. ""I think he just keeps getting better. I've been real pumped with [James] in practice, and it would be awesome to get four guys up, but you're only using really two on offense. So, it's got to make sense with the rest of the roster.""

McCaffrey has, of course, been the focal point of San Francisco's offense and a big reason the team sits at 9-4 this season.

Now, 10 weeks later, they need to repeat that feat in order to lock up the division and crown themselves champion for the first time since 2019.

For a victory in the rematch with Buffalo, however, the team of head coach Mike Vrabel will need to bring its A-game. The Bills, after all, are far from dead and stayed the course even after losing to New England earlier in the year: at 9-4, they still have a chance to win their sixth straight division title, and a victory on Sunday would help boost their chances to snatch the top spot away from the Patriots after all.

As always when going up against an opponent of that quality, a complete game is need in all three phases. That said, our eyes will be on a handful of players in particular: considering the circumstances and opponent, here are our pivotal Patriots for Sunday’s game.

RB Rhamondre Stevenson

The Bills run defense has improved slightly over the course of the season, but it is still ranked toward the bottom of the league in efficiency categories such as yards per carry (5.1) and EPA per run (0.045). For New England and its lead running back, this presents an opportunity.

Rhamondre Stevenson has had an up-and-down year so far; he missed time with a toe injury and fumbled three times over the first five weeks of the season, but also has contributed some big plays as a runner and receiver while additionally showing some good pass protection. Considering Buffalo’s defensive weaknesses, one would expect him to be in line for a solid game. Then again, despite scoring two touchdowns, Stevenson was a relative non-factor in the first meeting between those two teams.

WR Stefon Diggs

In his first ever trip back to Orchard Park, Diggs was the most impactful skill position player on the field. Catching 10 passes for 146 yards in Week 5, he willed the Patriots to victory over his former team. To repeat as victors in front of the Gillette Stadium crowd, a similar performance would go a long way.

A veteran of 11 NFL seasons, Diggs knows that no two games are alike. That does not mean there are no lessons to be taken away from his first meeting with the Bills in October either

“That was a long time ago,” he said this week. “A lot of things have happened throughout this season that we kind of learned from. Even that game — we learned a lot from that game and we were like, ‘Damn, if we had this back, we would have done this differently. We would have done that differently.’ But all is well ends well when you win the game. You learn a lot throughout the season that’s going to help you towards the end.

“And the landscape looks different. It’s going to be a little more colder. It’s going to be some winter weather, whatever it is. I think the biggest thing for us is packing what our coach called identity and who we are, what we like to do and that’s finishing plays and that’s being aggressive and that’s being smart.”

LG Jared Wilson

The Patriots suffered some major losses during their win in Cincinnati in Week 12, including the entire left side of their offensive line. While tackle Will Campbell will be out another week on injured reserve due to the sprained MCL he sustained that day, guard Jared Wilson seems set to make a comeback against Buffalo.

Under normal circumstances, Wilson would slot into the left guard spot between Campbell’s replacement Vederian Lowe and center Garrett Bradbury. However, there is no telling just how quickly the third-round rookie will be up to speed again despite not carrying an injury designation into the matchup; even if he is cleared for starting action, there might be some rust to be shaken off after virtually not playing for three straight weekends both physically and in regards to his chemistry with Lowe in particular.

It helps that Buffalo will be without stalwart defensive tackle Ed Oliver. The remaining front seven — including starting tackles DaQuan Jones and Deone Walker as well as edges Joey Bosa and Greg Rousseau — will still present a challenge for the young lineman and the rest of the starting five.

DT Khyiris Tonga

Another player who recently missed some time, Tonga is set to make his own comeback after suffering an injury against Cincinnati. The Patriots will need him to be at his best, too, given Buffalo’s willingness to run the football as well as the scramble abilities provided by quarterback Josh Allen.

“He can do everything,” Tonga said about Allen this week. “Run the ball, throw the ball, throw 60 yards across his body — he can do it all. And we know that, so it’s going to be a fun challenge.”

With fellow defensive tackle Milton Williams on IR, Tonga projects as a starter alongside Christian Barmore (who himself was a limited participant in two of three practices this week). How much action he will actually see, however, has yet to be determined: Cory Durden, Eric Gregory and Joshua Farmer provide rotational depth behind the two top options, and likely will be moved in and out of the lineup as well. That said, at his peak, Tonga and Barmore is the best pairing New England has available against Allen and company.

LB Robert Spillane

The Bills offense presents an array of problems, and as a result no position might be under bigger pressure than linebacker. Tops among the LBs on the Patriots, of course, is team captain Robert Spillane.

Typically a 100-percenter on the defensive side of the ball — even though it remains to be seen whether his current foot injury will impact his availability — Spillane will be faced with a multitude of tasks. There is coming downhill to help stop James Cook and Buffalo’s potent run game; there is spying Josh Allen as a run threat; there is covering tight ends Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox; and there is communicating with the rest of the unit against a team using motion on 55.2% of snaps and play action on 16.5%.

K Andy Borregales

Whether or not you believe the Patriots’ underdog status is justified, Sunday’s game projects as a highly-contested affair that could be decided by a handful of points. If so, kicker Andy Borregales will again be in the spotlight.

The sixth-round draft pick has had a solid rookie campaign so far, hitting on 23 of 26 field goals and 36 of 38 extra points. The Patriots will need him to be accurate again on Sunday, especially after he went off he mark in both of his last two appearances at Gillette Stadium: against the Jets and Giants in Weeks 11 and 13, respectively, he missed one field goal each. Like this upcoming game, those two were played in cold conditions as well.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/12/gettyimages-2247701407.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.56334483552052%2C100%2C78.526334262636&w=1200,N,,2025-12-13 20:59:11.128800

The Titans (2-11) visit the 49ers (9-4) at Levi's Stadium (3:25 p.m. CT, FOX). McCaffrey is the engine the 49ers' offense is based around, as he's not only the NFL's third-leading rusher by attempts, but he's also the league's fifth-leading receiver by catches.

He's touched the football 322 times in 13 games, which works out to three more touches per game than any other player. Only Atlanta's Bijan Robinson and Indianapolis' Jonathan Taylor have gained more yards from scrimmage this season than McCaffrey.

Injuries have plagued McCaffrey throughout his career; he's only played one full season without missing a game since 2020.

CeeDee Lamb out of protocol, at practice

CeeDee Lamb navigated concussion protocol this week and should be fully operational for his team’s Sunday night home date with Minnesota.

Philip Rivers, a grandfather who’s spent the past five years coaching high school football, might actually be the starting quarterback for Indianapolis this weekend at Seattle. It’s an incredible story, if also a hopeless situation. Avoid any fringy Colts until further notice.

Tee Higgins has been ruled out for the Baltimore matchup Sunday after reentering concussion protocol. Mike Gesicki, Andrei Iosivas and Mitchell Tinsley could see upticks in usage, but think of them as DFS fliers, not reliable starters in traditional leagues.

Marvin Harrison isn’t ready to return from his heel injury just yet, so Michael Wilson gets the greenest possible green light, even in a challenging matchup with Houston.

Josh Jacobs reportedly experienced swelling in his knee this week. He was limited in practice yesterday following DNPs the prior two days, which is clearly a positive development.

De’Von Achane practiced Thursday and Friday (albeit in a non-contact jersey), so he should be good to go for Monday night’s trip to Pittsburgh.

Rome Odunze was limited in every practice session this week while dealing with a stress reaction in his foot and is officially questionable for tomorrow’s frigid game against Cleveland.

T.J. Watt won’t be available to face the Dolphins after suffering a partially collapsed lung during a dry needling treatment session. What a gruesome sentence that was. Downgrade Pittsburgh’s DST this week.

Lamar Jackson panic

We promise there was actually a time earlier this year when Lamar Jackson was one of the right answers in fantasy football. In fact, he was the season’s top per-game scorer among all quarterbacks just six weeks ago. Jackson had returned from a multi-week hamstring injury with a four-touchdown performance against Miami in which he completed nearly 80 percent of his throws. He looked like a potential league-winner.

Over Jackson’s past five games, however, he’s looked suspiciously like a guy determined to drag our fantasy teams into the consolation bracket. He added ankle and toe issues to the hamstring concern, and he only occasionally gets in full practice sessions. Jackson has thrown two touchdown passes and four picks since the start of November, averaging a modest 197.4 passing yards per game. He also hasn’t rushed for 50 yards in any week since the season opener. Not great.

Jackson has slowed down both figuratively and literally:

On the other hand, Jackson has been victimized by a remarkable series of near-TDs and negated scores over his past two games — drops, goal-line fumbles, phantom OPI penalties and replay overrules have taken points off the board for Baltimore. It’s been an outrageously unlucky ride.

Matchups don’t get much better than what’s on deck for Jackson this week in Cincinnati. So far this season, the Bengals defense has given up the third-most fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks. Cincinnati ranks next-to-last in the league in passing yards allowed (254.9 YPG) and last in passing touchdowns (29). This is a defense that’s allowed multi-touchdown games to fantasy luminaries such as Trevor Lawrence, Carson Wentz and Caleb Williams.

Realistically, you can’t sit a quarterback with Jackson’s ceiling in a get-right spot like this. You are certainly allowed to worry, however. Over to Jake Ciely for more:

💬 Jake’s take

Heading into the Steelers matchup last week, I would have said my level of Lamar concern was extremely elevated. After? It’s moderately minimal. OK, I’ll avoid more annoying alliteration. I had Jackson as a low-end QB1 last week because we hadn’t seen a healthy (or even close) version capable of running with ease. He wasn’t 100 percent against Pittsburgh, but he was close to it. Jackson looked better than he had in some time.

The worry isn’t eliminated, however. While this should be a good week, the Patriots and Packers aren’t great matchups in Weeks 16-17 — particularly if Jackson is playing at 80-90 percent. He lost his top-three weekly set-it-and-forget-it status. If he tweaks this injury at any point, I’d consider benching him again. But let’s hope our Christmas present is a healthy Jackson and top-five playoff returns.

Last-minute moves

Jake Ciely has devoted his professional life to ranking a vast array of objects and people. At this point, if Jake hasn’t ranked something or someone, then it seems fair to question its cultural relevance. Let’s review a few names that landed in unusual spots in Jake’s Week 15 fantasy rankings:

Jared Goff is attached to the game with the highest projected total (54.5) in Week 15, so Jake is understandably not sweating the matchup with the Rams defense. Goff lands at QB9, three spots ahead of industry consensus.

Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal are nowhere near each other on Ciely’s board this week, landing at RB24 and RB41, respectively. Both backs were effective against Philadelphia last Monday, but Hampton is the one who broke the plane.

Stefon Diggs tortured his former team in the first meeting this season at Buffalo (10 for 146), and a repeat performance seems entirely possible. Jake got aggressive with Diggs, slotting him four spots ahead of consensus at WR19.

Matchups to embrace 🤗 and avoid 😨

Each week, KC Joyner delivers a thorough preview of the best and worst matchups on the upcoming slate. Below is a sampling of notable names for Week 15.

Start with confidence

QB Jaxson Dart, RB Tyrone Tracy and WR Darius Slayton (vs. WAS), QB Brock Purdy (vs. TEN), QB Shedeur Sanders (at CHI), RB Kenneth Walker (vs. IND), WR Chimere Dike (at SF), TE Mark Andrews (at CIN)

Exercise caution

QB Bo Nix, WR Troy Franklin and TE Evan Engram (vs. GB), QB Caleb Williams (vs. CLE), RB Breece Hall (at JAX), WR Michael Pittman (at SEA), TE Jake Ferguson (vs. MIN)

On the cut line 🔪

Fantasy analysts are more than happy to give you long lists of must-add fantasy options, but we aren’t quite as forthcoming with drop recommendations. Let the record show that you have our official permission to discard any of the following players:

Jayden Daniels seemed like a great idea this time last week, but, um … no. Washington chose to start him against the Vikings even though his left elbow was apparently not sufficiently recovered to tolerate standard-issue contact with the turf. Daniels won’t play this week, and it’s difficult to imagine why the team would put him at risk again this season. He cannot be started in fantasy until 2026.

DJ Moore appeared to have a massive opportunity last week at Green Bay, with Odunze sidelined by injury. Alas, Moore saw only three targets in the loss, two of which resulted in him being absolutely obliterated. He finished with -4 receiving yards, which is not ideal. He’s well outside the circle of fantasy trust at the moment, unplayable and thus droppable.

Isiah Pacheco is finishing the 2025 season just as he did last year, running as the clear No. 2 in Kansas City’s backfield behind Kareem Hunt. Pacheco isn’t a volume receiver, and he doesn’t see the goal line carries, so he has no obvious path to fantasy value at the moment. He remains rostered in 50 percent of Sleeper leagues (60 percent at ESPN), but he’s done nothing recently to earn his spot on your squad.

Sleeper of the week 💤

Isaiah Likely has drawn a dozen targets and delivered 120 receiving yards over Baltimore’s past two games, and he’s now headed into a matchup with Cincinnati’s defense, a unit that’s been historically generous to opposing tight ends. The Bengals have allowed 15 touchdowns to the position, an almost incomprehensible total. Not surprisingly, Cincy has also given up the most receptions (97) and receiving yards (1,258) to tight ends. If you’ve been streaming the position, Likely is your clear priority this week.

💬 From the Discord

At any given moment, there’s a good chance one of The Athletic’s writers is conducting an AMA in our fantasy football Discord server. No reasonable question is ever refused. Here’s a loaded question from Thursday’s chat:

Agwoq: With [Tee] Higgins most likely out, it is desperation time. 0.5 PPR, 1 Flex spot — Addison, Flournoy, Pearsall, Monangai, Vidal, Charbonnet or an absolute insanity move with Likely? All seem relatively similar. Leaning towards Addison, but none fill me with any confidence.

First of all, Likely would be a perfectly sane move in a week in which he faces the greatest possible matchup in the history of his position. (See above.) Zach Charbonnet, however, is the play for me. Seattle is a 13.5-point favorite at home against the Daniel Jones-less Colts, a reeling team making wild late-season personnel decisions. Charbonnet has made eight house calls on the season, and he’s averaging a respectable 11.9 touches per game. He offers both floor and ceiling.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/12173817/USATSI_27741650-1-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-13 19:00:53.954576

They are now placing running back Terrell Jennings on injured reserve, according to NFL insider Ian Rapoport.

Jennings entered concussion protocol after the Patriots’ Week 13 win over the New York Giants. However, even with the Week 14 bye, he was unable to get cleared to play. The Patriots initially ruled him out on Friday.

Rapoport noted that Jennings should be back for the playoffs after missing four games. Jennings has just 23 carries this season for 73 yards. He has scored a touchdown as well. In the passing game, he has one catch for nine yards.

Jennings is in his second year, but has been stuck behind TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson on the depth chart. He saw more work when Stevenson was hurt, but has since gone back to being the third running back.

He has played 51 special teams snaps, so perhaps that’s where the Patriots will be losing the biggest impact. According to Rapoport, the Patriots plan to sign D’Ernest Johnson to the active roster this week.

Johnson has 996 rushing yards in his career. He has played for four teams in seven years and has played in three games for the Patriots this season. He has just seven yards, but he provides an experienced replacement for Jennings.

Lawrence was a Friday addition to the injury report.

The Giants will need to make a series of roster moves Saturday if all or some of Green, Muasau, Ezeudu and Collins are going to be activated off injured reserve.

“There are a few scenarios that we’ve been talking through over the last couple of days,” interim head coach Mike Kafka said.

Thibodeaux was optimistic before the bye that he would return for the final four games. Make that three games (at best) now.

“There’s still a ton of optimism,” Kafka said. “I think he’s fired up and preparing himself to get out there with the players. It’s just about when he feels comfortable and when the doctors feel really good to clear him.”

The Giants claimed WR Ryan Miller off waivers from the Buccaneers. He played 123 offensive snaps and 205 special-teams snaps.

Look, Hallett’s been taking reps, (Thomas) DT’s been taking reps, Maddox has been taking reps. We’ve got plenty of guys.","On Saturday, ahead of traveling to the West Coast for a Week 15 matchup with the Los Angeles Rams, the Detroit Lions announced that they have downgraded two players to OUT: safety Thomas Harper (concussion) and Christian Mahogany (fibula).

With Brian Branch likely headed to injured reserve later on Saturday (transactions are typically announced at 4 pm ET), and Kerby Joseph already ruled out, the Lions were hopeful that Harper would be available to start alongside Anthony Maddox against the Rams. Unfortunately, it appears Harper was unable to clear the NFL’s concussion protocols, despite practicing all three days this past week. Returning to practice is a key component in progressing through the NFL’s protocols. However, players in the protocol still need to be medically cleared, and it can be assumed that Harper did not pass the independent medical testing.

With the Lions’ top three safeties unavailable, there is no clear frontrunner to start alongside Maddox on Sunday. Veteran Daniel Thomas looks like he could be the next man up, but he is primarily a special teamer and may not be the preferred option. The Lions also claimed Jalen Mills off waivers this week, but with only a few days of practice, he seems unlikely to be ready to step into a starting role.

The most likely candidate to challenge Thomas for the starting role is Erick Hallett. While currently on the practice squad, Hallett could be a candidate for roster elevation, as he has already started one game for the Lions this season (against the Buccaneers in Week 7). He was also the first name Lions coach Dan Campbell mentioned when discussing the options at safety this week.

“We’ll be good. Look, Hallett’s been taking reps, (Thomas) DT’s been taking reps, Maddox has been taking reps. We’ve got plenty of guys. They’re getting valuable reps, so we’re good,” Campbell said on Friday.

Mahogany started his injury evaluation clock this week, and while the Lions initially left the door open for him to return to the active roster for this game, he’s not quite ready and was downgraded to out, keeping him on injured reserve. With two weeks remaining in his evaluation window, Mahogany still has a lot of time to rehabilitate. That being said, he appeared to be close to returning for this game, meaning he will likely have a good chance of returning in Week 16 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Look for the Lions to ask Kayode Awosika to start at left guard this week. However, if his foot injury keeps him from that role, the Lions could turn back to veteran Trystan Colon, who started at left guard last week. We could also see rookie Miles Frazier get some pre-planned reps, regardless of who starts, as coaches are looking to get him more experience.",https://platform.prideofdetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/127/2025/12/imagn-27742320.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.727820977519%2C100%2C78.544358044962&w=1200,N,,2025-12-13 17:00:27.425073

Don't speak this into existence. Even as someone who loathes having to face Burrow twice a year (at least), he's incredible and the league is a better place with him in it.

He's putting pressure on the FO and the people who need to make those decisions because he hopefully has the power to affect real change within the organization.

The expectation is that the Indianapolis Colts will activate the 44-year-old Philip Rivers from the practice squad Saturday to be their starter, granting us one of the most improbable and unlikely comebacks in modern NFL history -- the cherry on top of one of the best slates you could ask for. The Colts have not officially named Rivers the starter, and Riley Leonard (knee) was a full participant at practice all week.

Sunday vs. the Seahawks (4:25 ET, CBS) will mark 1,800 days exactly since Rivers' last NFL game, which will be the longest layoff by a quarterback 40 years or older in league history. While many around the league have privately joked about this comeback, and others have issued worries about the spot Rivers is putting himself in, the quarterback has said he's not naïve to the challenges ahead on Sunday against the league's second-ranked defense in Seattle.

""I know that there's risk involved, obviously, on what may or may not happen,"" Rivers said. ""But the only way to find out is going for it. I just felt almost like it was a gift, another opportunity to play and cut it loose with the guys and the game you love to play and the dream that you got to live. You may get some bonus time.""

There is no good comparison in the modern NFL for what Rivers is going to attempt. Steve DeBerg played in 1998 at 44 years old after a four-year layoff, but he didn't start in a game until late in the year and had been with the Falcons all training camp and season long.

When Joe Flacco came off the couch for the Browns in 2023, he was 38 years old and had played the previous year with the Jets. Flacco also still had a great arm, something that Rivers has never really possessed.

""Quick game!,"" he said. ""Honestly, you got to be able to establish run game and then passes need to really have thoroughly thought out hot outlets so he can get the ball out.

""Mike Macdonald is going to have some fun packages to watch.""

I then turned to one of the best defensive coaches in the league for how he would plan for Rivers if he ran the Seattle defense.

""I am heavy disguise with two pressures at least he hasn't seen on tape,"" the coach said. ""I'm base defense against 11 personnel early and I'm simulating pressure on second and pass.""

Both Seattle's theoretical plan of attack and Rivers' own plan are predicated on his lack of mobility. When he takes the field Sunday he will instantly be the least mobile quarterback in the league.

His average speed of 3.02 mph/play in 2020 was fourth slowest in the league behind Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees. Today, he would rank second behind only Mac Jones (3.01 mph), but this is five years later with three practices under his belt.

It is unlikely Rivers will be able to do much from under center, either. In 2020 with the Colts he was in shotgun 90.1 percent of the time, third-highest in the league then. Daniel Jones worked out of shotgun 78.5 percent of the time this season, ranking 20th in the league.

It's possible Rivers looks about as mobile as he did in the 2007 AFC Championship Game when he played on a torn ACL. Of course, he was 26 then.

What's clear is that Colts head coach Shane Steichen will have to do things differently for Rivers than he was with Jones, who had five rushing touchdowns.

Saturday's expected elevation will also remove Rivers from consideration for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026 and push his eligibility window out five more years. Rivers would not have gotten into the Hall on this ballot, and it's possible he will always be on the outside looking in with zero All Pros and no Super Bowl appearances.

But if he can somehow defy the odds and get the Colts into the playoffs, Rivers may get his second NFL Comeback Player of the Year award and add enough to his legacy that his Hall candidacy in the 2030s is stronger than it is today.

Who is Daniel Jones playing for in 2026?

If Rivers is the Colts present, Indy's future remains a question. Daniel Jones' Achilles injury means he won't be cleared for contact at a practice until June workouts at the absolute earliest, and likely not until some point during training camp.

Jones is on a one-year contract, meaning the Colts or another team will have to sign him this spring just over three months removed from Achilles surgery. Who is going to do that? And what will his price be?

The second question is hard to answer. It was already difficult to nail down before the injury, considering his level of play through the first half of the season, then the slight decline, along with his history of signing a major deal just to watch everything around him crumble. But with this injury? The second season-ender of his career? That's a difficult projection before Christmas.

The Colts will have the franchise tag at their disposal when it comes to Jones. Indianapolis will surely want Jones back, but it's possible the two sides won't be able to agree to terms. The way Indy ensures it keeps Jones on the team is by using the tag, which will be upwards of $40 million next year. That's a big number for a player coming off a serious injury, and there's no way to anticipate whether Indianapolis would issue the tag now when their doctors would need to fully evaluate Jones months after surgery.

And though much younger than Kirk Cousins and Aaron Rodgers when they had their injuries, might there be some hesitation in a team putting their 2026 eggs in the Jones basket coming off Achilles surgery?

I think what's clear is Jones will want the best situation for himself, from contract to front office to coach to roster. That very well could be in Indy with either the tag or a contract. If the Colts don't tag him, it's possible he becomes a free agent. The best situation may present itself somewhere outside of Indianapolis, in that case. Multiple sources have pointed to Minnesota as being a potential landing spot.

Jones picked the Vikings after his release from the Giants, and J.J. McCarthy has played so poorly it is clear Minnesota will need some quarterback insurance next year regardless of how he finishes the year.

The Colts have plenty to figure out these next few weeks. And Jones has plenty to work through these next few months. But unless the Colts are willing to issue the franchise tag, I don't see it as a slam dunk that Jones is back with Indy next year.

Let's hope we don't get 'Replacement Refs' 2.0

Something that flew a bit under the radar this week was the NFL informing team owners that its talks with the NFL Referees Association toward a new collective bargaining agreement have been ""unsuccessful."" This could wind up being a big deal!

The CBA for officials expires at the end of May, and if talks are unsuccessful in December, I don't know why anyone would feel enthused about minds being changed come the offseason when there's no deadline pressure with games three-plus months away.

To recap, the league wants to reward high-performing officials with more year-end bonus money, wants to get rid of seniority considerations when giving out postseason assignments, wants mandatory training for low-performing officials, wants to extend a probationary period that removes underperforming officials, wants to shrink the dead period that's currently from the Super Bowl to May 15 and wants to increase its ""practice squad"" of officials.

All of these things sound great, of course. And the refs union has decided to keep its wishes private. But you can imagine the union wants more money and fewer performance penalties for officials, at the very least.

While the NFL is the biggest thing going and usually gets its way, what is unique about this is we have seen officials be willing to strike before. The start of the 2012 season was a debacle with replacement officials, and that was when the league was pulling in half the money it does today. Throw in the fact that legalized sports gambling has taken over the country and the idea of these games being placed in the hands of below-standard officials is inconceivable.

And the NFL doesn't wield the sort of power over officials that it does over players. Players are, generally speaking, unwilling to have a work stoppage because that means their primary source of income, which can only be made in a finite amount of time, no longer comes in. The majority of NFL officials have primary jobs outside of the NFL. They can financially stomach a work stoppage much more easily than players could.

I did find there to be some irony in the NFL informing owners of these unsuccessful talks during a virtual league meeting that went virtual this year in part to cut costs. And then one day later, officials flagged the Falcons for the most penalties in a game in nine years.

The long and short is the NFL doesn't have its typical high ground in negotiations when it comes to the refs union, and I think that union knows it.

What sources say about Burrow's cryptic comments

Joe Burrow raised just about every eyebrow across the league this week with his comments about how much fun he's having and his future.

""If I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it. I've been through a lot, and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That's the mindset I'm trying to bring to the table,"" Burrow said.

""There's a lot of things going on right now,"" the QB added. And when asked if his frustrations are related to football or more personal, Burrow said ""all of the above.""

Because Burrow has a history of sending messages in the media, and because of Cincinnati's history with unhappy players, many took Burrow's comments to signal he may either want out of the Bengals organization or out of football entirely. Carson Palmer ultimately won his freedom from Cincinnati, and it does not seem like it's really been six years since Andrew Luck called it quits at Burrow's current age (he turned 29 this week).

But pump the brakes. I talked with a couple of sources on this who didn't think we are anywhere close to the above scenarios. ""Blown out"" of proportion, said one source. ""Crazy.""

""He was emotional on his birthday and pissed that for as much as he's worked, he's still not able to win. That's all he wants to do. ... If he cannot win he's miserable.""

Burrow's long injury history is well documented, and the Bengals are on the brink of missing the playoffs for the fourth time in Burrow's six years. But he has another four years left on the largest contract in team history, and I don't get the sense that there's any panic inside the building about his long-term future with that organization.

Panthers enter biggest 3-game stretch in 10 years

Much like William Carlos Williams' red wheelbarrow, so much of the Panthers' playoff hopes depends upon beating the Saints in New Orleans on Sunday. The 7-6 Panthers just took sole possession of first place in the NFC South after Atlanta's comeback win against the Buccaneers. The franchise has not made the playoffs since 2017, and it has not hosted a playoff game since 2015.

If Carolina beats New Orleans on Sunday and can beat Tampa Bay next week, the Panthers will have locked up the division. Carolina can lose to Tampa in Week 16 but beat them in Week 18 and win the division, too.

This is the latest in a season Carolina has been at the top of the division since its Super Bowl run in 2015. Very few of the current players have been in the position they currently are, and this is where coaching comes into play.

Dave Canales has a coaching staff that has playoff experience. He won a ring with Seattle, and OC Brad Idzik joined in late playoff success with the Seahawks. DC Ejiro Evero won a Super Bowl with the Rams and went to others. There are other rings on the staff, as well as two Triple OGs in Jim Caldwell and Dom Capers.

As one source put it, there's a ""numbing sense"" where things within a playoff team's building should not and do not change, where players ignore the noise and stay focused on maintaining the process. A huge few weeks in Charlotte.

This week's unlikely QB story: Brady Cook

Do not sleep on Brady Cook this week against the Jaguars. The undrafted rookie quarterback out of Missouri will be the league's 51st starting quarterback* this season when he takes the first snap for the Jets on Sunday with Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields both out.

I'm told Cook ""has been giving the defense fits"" at practice the last few weeks. He doesn't have the biggest arm, but he's a great processor and the offense can rally around him. Cook faces a difficult task against the Jags defense, but a good showing will reflect well on him and his prospects with Gang Green as a backup in 2026.

Cook was a three-year starter at Mizzou and left as one of the most decorated passers in school history -- second only to Chase Daniel in wins and No. 3 in passing yards. Jets fans remember Brad Smith, the do-it-all former QB from the late aughts. Cook joined Smith, Daniel and Drew Lock as Mizzou players to amass over 10,000 yards in their career.

* — Cook could be the 52nd starting quarterback this season depending on who takes the field first between himself and Raiders starter Kenny Pickett. Both are playing in 1 p.m. ET kickoffs, so we'll know who gets the coveted 51st slot then.

NFL's next McVay hasn't turned 30 yet

It would be crazy to interview a 30-year-old for an NFL head coaching job, right? Right?

Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski is a name you'll probably be hearing a lot more of in the coming weeks. Udinski turns 30 in January, he's the non-play-calling OC of the AFC South-leading Jags, and he may be interviewing for head coaching gigs in about five weeks from now.

Udinski got into the league in 2020 when he followed Matt Rhule to Carolina from Baylor. Since then, he has worked his way up the offensive coaching ladder, spending three years in Minnesota before joining Liam Coen's inaugural staff in Jacksonville. He contributed to some of the best years of Kirk Cousins' career, then the best year of Sam Darnold's career and a resurgence in Trevor Lawrence's career this season.

I am not saying Udinski gets a head coaching gig. He'd be almost 11 months younger than Sean McVay when he took the Rams job. But the Jaguars can block teams from interviewing Udinski for a play-calling OC role, so the only way for a team to ensure they can get him in their building for a chat is to interview him for the vacant head coaching position. Teams interviewing folks for elevated positions only hoping to eventually hire them elsewhere in the organization has happened plenty in recent years even though it is not supposed to.

At the very least, teams may want to try to pick the brain of the young, bright offensive star.

Belichick shuffles UNC staff, including Kitchens

Bill Belichick began dismantling his UNC coaching staff this week as he hopes to improve on what was a bad year on the field and perhaps a more embarrassing year off the field for the program. I have said for months now that the team didn't have much of a chance due to the lack of talent -- its roster ranked in the 30s, per 247Sports -- and that showed with just two victories against Power Four opponents.

While no one who watched Carolina play this season is surprised to see offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens won't be with the team in 2026, I point to the above lack of talent and more. Kitchens had three preventative heart surgeries in 11 days last year, I'm told, which had been anticipated after his initial heart issue arose in 2013. So it was a difficult start to the season personally for him along with getting 70 new players on the team acclimated to the scheme.

The former Browns head coach in 2019, Kitchens has been in the college ranks since 2021. He's fully healthy now, and I think he will be in the mix for both college and pro jobs as these cycles continue in the coming weeks.

I don't see Gruden landing Michigan job

One other pro/college coaching note: a name I have seen floated around for the vacant Michigan job is Jon Gruden. I truly do not know if Gruden will coach again this upcoming year or beyond, and it's possible that question won't be answered until his lawsuit against the NFL reaches a conclusion. But I do not see Gruden to Michigan as a possibility in Ann Arbor, according to multiple sources.

Food for thought if MVP becomes two-man race

With four weeks left in the season, I wouldn't shut down the MVP race just yet, but it's clearly shaping up to be a two-horse race between Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye. There will be plenty of metrics to help decide who should get the award at the end of the year, but one thing I would caution others (including voters) against when considering who should win:

Stafford is set to play three of his next four games in national windows, meaning his games against the Lions, Seahawks and Falcons will go to 100% of the country. Meanwhile, Maye is coming off a bye and has only next Sunday night's game against the Ravens going to the entire country.

All of these games are big for these two teams, which are each vying for their conference's top seed. It shouldn't matter that they played well in a game going nationwide. It should matter that they played well in the game, whether it goes to 7 percent of the country or the world.

I also won't hold against one or both of these guys if they sit the final game of the season because they have already locked up the No. 1 seed. Accomplishing the mission in 16 games is fantastic and should not be considered a detriment to one's end-of-season awards when it comes to total QB statistics.

Ravens doing flurry of deals; Broncos next?

Last week I wrote in this space about how some teams are trying to get in front of the potential spike in the salary cap by getting deals done at the end of this season versus waiting until the spring. Very clearly the Ravens are one of those teams.

After getting Mark Andrews' deal done, Baltimore inked Travis Jones to an extension this past week. We will see if they can get across the finish line with Tyler Linderbaum, who has been another extension target for the team.

Another team to look for is the Denver Broncos. Quarterback Bo Nix will be on his rookie deal for at least one more year, and GM George Paton is looking to make some deals before the end of this year, I'm told.

Higgins' injury puts NFL concussion protocol under scrutiny

Tee Higgins will miss Sunday's game against the Ravens after suffering his second concussion of the season this past week against the Bills, and it's bad optics for the league's concussion protocol.

The NFL has worked intensely on strengthening its concussion protocol. According to a joint review of the process by the league and the players union, it appears all steps were followed last week when Higgins was checked twice for a concussion during the game. It was not until after the game, as part of the protocol process, where Higgins reported symptoms and was officially placed in protocol.

This came two weeks after Higgins suffered a concussion, and against the Bills he appeared to hit his head in a similar way that had resulted in the previous head injury. I'm no doctor, but it was surprising to see Higgins stay in the game after the first head hit. It was stunning to see him stay in the game after the second.

The return-to-play protocol is the same for any player regardless of being concussed once or twice, and it's a slippery slope to change any rules because of how things may ""appear."" But as someone who has covered concussions in the NFL for several years now, Sunday's events seemed like a gap in the protocol armor that needs to be addressed.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/13/1c5480ad-be47-4f2d-8086-47842e022638/thumbnail/1200x675/3aa37f078f201470f74bc79786242f98/philrivers.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 15:01:44.440384

In Watt's situation, according to his brother JJ, he suffered a partially collapsed lung (also a pneumothorax) after a dry needling treatment session.","PITTSBURGH -- Steelers star T.J. Watt, one of the highest-paid edge rushers in the NFL and the 2021 AP Defensive Player of the Year, suffered a partially collapsed lung during a Wednesday dry needling treatment at the team facility, prompting questions about the events that led to the incident and what will happen next.

J.J. Watt, T.J.'s brother, said in a social media statement Friday that T.J. had surgery Thursday to repair and stabilize his lung and was released from the hospital Friday.

""Yesterday TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility,"" J.J. Watt wrote on social media. ""Recovery timeline is still TBD, but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today. He and his family are very appreciative of everyone's kind words and well wishes.""

T.J. Watt, 31, will not play in Monday's home prime-time matchup against the Miami Dolphins (8:15 ET, ESPN), Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said, as Pittsburgh seeks to bolster its AFC North lead over the Baltimore Ravens.

The Steelers haven't provided many details surrounding the incident. The initial statement released by Pittsburgh spokesperson Burt Lauten on Thursday said Watt went to the hospital for further evaluation of his lung after experiencing ""discomfort"" at the practice facility Wednesday. After Friday's practice, Tomlin said Watt had a ""medical procedure today or yesterday."" And when asked if the incident that led to Watt's hospitalization occurred during a dry needling session, as J.J. Watt said, Tomlin continued to be vague.

""I don't have a lot of information, so I'm certainly not going to dispute something that's said by someone close to him,"" Tomlin said. ""I hadn't had discussions along those lines.""

The NFL Players Association is aware of the situation and has been in touch with Watt and his representation. ""Our main immediate priority is supporting T.J.'s health and full recovery,"" the NFLPA said in a statement.

Dry needling isn't unusual during an NFL player's physical therapy, but a significant incident like this is uncommon.

Did Watt have an injury before the treatment? What is dry needling? Is Watt's situation similar to then-Chargers quarterback Tyrod Taylor's situation in 2020, when he suffered a punctured lung? How will Pittsburgh's defense step up as the team chases a divisional title? Steelers reporter Brooke Pryor and ESPN senior writer and injury analyst Stephania Bell break down the biggest questions.

Did Watt have a chest or back injury before the dry needling?

Watt has not been listed on the team practice or injury report this season. Tomlin also said Thursday that, to his knowledge, Watt didn't have an injury that was worthy of being on an injury report or after the Steelers' Week 14 game.

Watt was on the practice report because of a toe injury during the week leading up to the game at Baltimore, and earlier in the season, he was listed on the practice report because of a hip issue leading up to the Week 8 home game against the Green Bay Packers. Dry needling isn't necessarily associated as a treatment for a specific injury, and it can be used to alleviate general muscle tightness, including around the shoulders, and in some cases, the pectoral muscles. -- Pryor

What is dry needling? What is required to legally administer dry needling? How safe is it?

Dry needling is a skilled intervention where the provider uses a thin needle to penetrate the skin with the goal of alleviating pain and improving movement. Unlike ""wet"" needling, which utilizes a hollow bore needle (which has a central channel to allow liquid to pass through it) to inject a medication, dry needling utilizes a solid needle and no substance is injected.

Common applications for dry needling include, but aren't limited to, muscle pain/strains (e.g., hamstring, quad), tendinitis/tendinopathy (e.g., patellofemoral, biceps, rotator cuff), plantar fasciitis and headaches. Utilization has expanded within the past decade, in particular, and it is not uncommon to see dry needling in most athletic rehabilitation settings or training rooms.

Requirements vary by state as to who may legally perform dry needling. The range of practitioners engaging in dry needling may include physical therapists, athletic trainers, acupuncturists, chiropractors, physicians, physician assistants, nurses and nurse practitioners.

Health care professionals typically undergo post-graduate education specific to dry needling procedures. The requirements vary by state as to requisite hours of training as there is no nationally recognized board that oversees dry needling certification. Programs require completion of didactic and practical elements, and participants must pass written and practical exams that incorporate safety components.

Dr. Sue Falsone, president and founder of Structure and Function Education, is a physical therapist, athletic trainer and certified strength and conditioning specialist who has over 15 years of experience practicing and teaching dry needling. She has treated and consulted with numerous elite athletes, including NFL and MLB players, and says there are numerous safety studies that have been published showing very low risk with dry needling.

""Precautions and patient safety are always a part of any patient intervention,"" Falsone said, ""but as with any modality, there is a chance for an adverse reaction.""

Falsone noted that the four most common adverse reactions consistently documented in the scientific literature are relatively benign. They include bleeding (noted as a drop or two of blood at the needle site), localized bruising, pain or residual soreness at the needle site and pain or soreness away from the site.

""Pneumothorax [punctured lung] is reported in the literature as a very rare event,"" Falsone said. -- Bell

How many other Steelers do dry needling?

It's hard to say how many Steelers players seek dry needling to treat tight muscles and soreness during the season, but former linebacker James Harrison told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler in 2015 that ""three to five"" other players in the locker room were also doing dry needling.

""It's a more invasive form of needling,"" Harrison said then. ""It can be recovery-based and help to heal any injuries that are nagging. ... It's painful as hell.""

Steelers inside linebacker Patrick Queen said Friday that he prefers to use acupuncture over dry needling.

""Kind of two different things,"" Queen said. ""... I don't do the whole dry needle thing. I'm actually scared of dry needling, so I kind of stay away from that stuff.

""It is unfortunate. You could probably get dry needled a thousand times and never have anything happen, and it just probably a half an inch in the wrong direction. So, you never know.""

Queen added that he has always been cautious about whom he permits to use needles on him in treatment.

""Obviously, it's needles, then you need 'em in the right spot and stuff, and they could go in the wrong spot at any time,"" he said. -- Pryor

What should be the typical prognosis for Watt? Will there be any long-term effects?

The most critical aspect of Watt's case is that once he reported symptoms and was evaluated, he was sent to the hospital for care emergently and treated promptly by the appropriate personnel. This gives him an excellent chance of full recovery.

Lung tissue is remarkably resilient, especially in a young, healthy athlete. A lung injury like Watt's has the potential to heal within 7-10 days, and there should be no long-term effects. -- Bell

Is this like the Tyrod Taylor situation? What are the differences?

Taylor was reportedly dealing with two cracked ribs and received a pregame pain-relieving injection, the intent of which was to decrease localized pain and allow him to compete on game day. The needle punctured a lung, and the result was a pneumothorax (where air leaks into the space between the lung and the chest wall, putting pressure on or ""collapsing"" the lung).

In Watt's situation, according to his brother JJ, he suffered a partially collapsed lung (also a pneumothorax) after a dry needling treatment session. By definition, dry needling means no medication was being delivered via the needle, making this different from Taylor's specific procedure.

While we do not have access to the specifics of either player's medical records, it is worth noting that every player's injury severity and recovery experience is unique, even in the presence of the same diagnosis. We do know that Taylor has since gone on to return to football at the NFL level and expect Watt to do the same. -- Bell

What does Watt's absence mean for the Steelers' defense in their quest to win the AFC North?

There's no firm timeline on Watt's return, and that's a significant hit for a team that has a slim lead over the Ravens for the AFC North and a coveted playoff spot with four games remaining.

The Steelers are 1-11 all time, including the playoffs, when Watt doesn't play. Watt last missed a game in the 2023 playoffs, when he was sidelined because of an MCL sprain for the wild-card loss to the Buffalo Bills in January 2024.

This time without Watt, the Steelers will rely on a rotation of Alex Highsmith, Nick Herbig and rookie Jack Sawyer. Highsmith, who has dealt with injuries throughout this season, sealed the win against the Ravens with a walk-off sack of Lamar Jackson.

""That's a clear representation of who he is, the type of plays he provides, the type of splash he makes, game on the line, he'll go make a play for us,"" Herbig said of Highsmith. ""That's who Alex is. That's who he's been his whole career.""

Herbig is also another young player on the rise. The 2023 fourth-round pick recorded two sacks the last time he faced a left-handed quarterback in Cleveland's Dillion Gabriel; Herbig had two tackles for loss and four quarterback hits. Herbig faces Miami's left-handed QB Tua Tagovailoa on Monday.

""T.J.'s done a great job of being a leader, not just in the room, but in the whole building, the organization,"" Herbig said. ""I think he rubs off on a lot of people in the right way, and I'm not worried at all because we have great guys, great leaders that'll pick up that slack, and I think that he's prepared, not just myself, but a bunch of the younger guys in that sense to be able to take on that larger role, not just as a player but as a leader, and bringing that energy and just doing everything that he does."" -- Pryor",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1213%2Fr1588703_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 13:00:32.231529

Ravens wide receiver Rashod Bateman is questionable to play after he didn't practice Friday due to ankle injury. Bateman was added to the injury report Thursday as a limited participant.

""We'll have to see how it looks tomorrow and into Sunday,"" Head Coach John Harbaugh said. ""It's just a nagging thing. It's an ankle sprain. You fight through it, you fight through it, and you can annoy it, I guess is the best way to say it.""

If Bateman can't play Sunday, that would open up more opportunities for veteran DeAndre Hopkins and second-year speedster Devontez Walker. Harbaugh and Offensive Coordinator Todd Monken have said this week that they want to get Hopkins more involved.

Tight end Mark Andrews, who also popped up on Thursday's report with a glute injury, was back on the field Friday and is set to play.

Ravens outside linebacker Tavius Robinson (foot) and safety Ar'Darius Washington (Achilles) are questionable and would need to be activated to the 53-man roster on Saturday to play. The Ravens currently only have 51 players on the roster, so there's room for them to move up without making a cut.

Robinson has missed the past seven games due to a foot injury and Washington could make his season debut after suffering an Achilles injury in May.

""I think they've looked good,"" Harbaugh said. ""We will talk to the trainers and things like that – the docs – but they've looked good to me.""

Bengals Star WR Tee Higgins to Miss Ravens Again

For the Bengals, star wide receiver Tee Higgins will be ruled out due to a concussion, per Head Coach Zac Taylor. Higgins practiced on a limited basis two days this week, but sat out Friday.

Higgins, who had 92 receiving yards and two touchdowns last week in Buffalo, also didn't play against the Ravens two weeks ago because of a concussion. He's played just two games against the Ravens in the past three regular seasons.

First-round rookie pass rusher Shemar Stewart (knee) is doubtful to play, along with backup safety PJ Jules (ankle).

Wembanyama was listed as probable on Friday’s Spurs injury report, but he pronounced himself “ready to go” while talking to reporters on Friday night.
Because, I mean, there was no reason to take (an) inconsiderate risk two days after my injury.” Wembanyama accepted the advice, but he’s been pushing for clearance for quite some time.
The Spurs beat the Los Angeles Lakers in Wednesday’s NBA Cup quarterfinal to advance to Las Vegas.
Wembanyama suffered the injury during the Spurs’ game against the Golden State Warriors.","After nearly a month sidelined by a left calf strain, Victor Wembanyama is expected to return for the San Antonio Spurs in Saturday’s NBA Cup semifinal in Las Vegas against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Wembanyama was listed as probable on Friday’s Spurs injury report, but he pronounced himself “ready to go” while talking to reporters on Friday night.

“I’m feeling great,” Wembanyama said during media availability.

Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said he expects Wembanyama to play, adding that the center will be on a minutes restriction, and he anticipates subbing him out of the game early.

Wembanyama felt he and the Spurs staff undertook the right process to get him back on the floor, acknowledging that he may be a little tired from the conditioning work he is still doing to ramp up ahead of Saturday’s game.

“It’s a lot of trust that comes into play both ways. I know I have a chance to be around the best staff in the world, so I trust them very much,” he said. “I have the chance, also, that they trust me because I’ve shown them I know my body and I give them good feedback.”

Johnson acknowledged that Wembanyama was lobbying to play from the day he suffered the injury on Nov. 14, trying to get into a game in Sacramento two days later. The Spurs shut him down and stated they would be abundantly cautious with Wembanyama, which was not easy for him to accept.

“But it’s true if it was only me, I would have came back earlier,” Wembanyama said. “But I think it’s more reasonable to do it (this) way, to listen to them and do as they said. Because, I mean, there was no reason to take (an) inconsiderate risk two days after my injury.”

Wembanyama accepted the advice, but he’s been pushing for clearance for quite some time. Johnson noted that the conversation around Wembanyama’s return has been going on for two weeks.

The Spurs beat the Los Angeles Lakers in Wednesday’s NBA Cup quarterfinal to advance to Las Vegas.

Wembanyama suffered the injury during the Spurs’ game against the Golden State Warriors. San Antonio went 9-3 without their 21-year-old face of the franchise, who averaged 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.6 blocks in 12 games this season.

Assuming he returns, the Spurs will be fully healthy for the first time this season. It comes just in time for a matchup against the defending champion Thunder, who, at 24-1, have tied the best 25-game start in NBA history.

During the Spurs’ shootaround Wednesday morning before the NBA Cup quarterfinal, Wembanyama tested his calf by jumping on force plates, which measure impact data from a player’s leaping and landing to help determine if they are moving with sufficient impact and any imbalances in the lower body. He and the surrounding staff seemed sufficiently satisfied with the results, a precursor to the Spurs’ medical staff giving him the go-ahead to play.

While Wembanyama has been getting in a warm-up before games this week, it has been a more abridged and lower-intensity routine than usual. The Spurs were adamant that they won’t rush him back, even for a game they have clearly valued.

For the Spurs to get past the Thunder, they will need Wembanyama to blend with the uptempo offense that has thrived without him. The Spurs maintained they wanted to play in transition as much as possible entering the season, but the offense got bogged down at times trying to learn how to play through Wembanyama. Once De’Aaron Fox returned from a hamstring strain and got control of the offense, everything started to fall into place, even without Wembanyama.

“I’ve been really proud,” he said. “Of course, it’s been hard to watch from my couch, but almost every night, they have proven (to) me that I have nothing to worry about.”

He was most proud that the team is playing the brand of basketball they have been aiming for since the start of training camp. Fox’s return has catalyzed their offensive evolution, getting more players involved and into their comfort zones.

It’s why Wembanyama said they are getting closer to “ideal basketball.”

“Everybody has something to eat,” he said. “Everybody can step up at any time. Everybody can take up responsibilities. Everybody trusts their next teammate. It’s just beautiful to see.”

The team will get better with its best player back, but the challenge is to maintain that same energy. Can everyone keep eating when Wembanyama needs so many calories?

If they can make it work, it could be lovely to watch.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/11171952/USATSI_27789448-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-13 13:00:35.186202

Yahya Black did not practice Friday, per the injury report, and fellow rookie defensive tackle Derrick Harmon continues to sit out.

That adds to three veteran defensive linemen on injured reserve for the Steelers, who have allowed 466 rushing yards over their past two games.

Monday’s opponent, the Miami Dolphins, have amassed 303 rushing yards over their past two and carry a four-game winning streak into the primetime meeting.

Harmon has missed the past two games because of a knee injury, and Black has a shoulder ailment. Additionally, the Steelers’ most accomplished defensive linemen — Cameron Heyward and Keeanu Benton — are listed on the injury report. Benton, in fact, was downgraded to limited participation Friday as he deals with his ankle injury.

Heyward missed practice Friday, listed with a knee injury. But it is not atypical for the 36-year-old to sit out a practice each week, and he is expected to play against the Dolphins.

The only fully healthy defensive linemen on the Steelers roster are Logan Lee, Esezi Otomewo and Brodric Martin-Rhodes. Those three have been in uniform for only a combined 13 games this season. Each has been a regular healthy scratch.

Kyler Baugh and Anthony Goodlow are defensive linemen on the practice squad. Between them is a total of 36 NFL regular-season snaps of experience, all by Goodlow earlier this season with the Arizona Cardinals before his release.

Dugger, others on track

Starting safety Kyle Dugger practiced fully for the second consecutive day, meaning there is a good chance he will return from a one-game absence because of a hand injury.

Other starters who practiced fully Friday despite nursing injuries were quarterback Aaron Rodgers (wrist), receiver DK Metcalf (abdomen) and inside linebacker Patrick Queen (hip).

Austin added, Pierre still out

Receiver Calvin Austin III was an addition to the injury report, getting a “limited participation” designation for Friday’s practice.

Joining T.J. Watt, Harmon, Black and Heyward as those who missed practice were starting cornerback James Pierre (calf) and fill-in starting left tackle Andrus Peat (concussion). If Pierre cannot play, Asante Samuel Jr. likely will get his first start with the Steelers. If Peat cannot play, Dylan Cook would get his first NFL start just seven days after his pro debut.

Status quo in protocol

Two other Steelers who joined Peat in NFL concussion protocol during last week’s win at the Baltimore Ravens remain limited in practice: inside linebacker Malik Harrison and tight end Darnell Washington.

Receiver and special teams ace Ben Skowronek was upgraded to a partial participant with his hand ailment suffered in Baltimore. Skowronek is expected to play against Miami.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/12/9124897_web1_ptr-Steelers38-091525.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 12:01:21.083078

In rehabilitation settings, dry needling is used as one tool among many.
Safety From a safety standpoint, dry needling has an extremely low rate of serious complications when performed by trained providers.
One study reviewing over 7,600 dry needling treatments performed by physical therapists reported zero major adverse effects.
This background makes physical therapists particularly well qualified to use techniques like dry needling safely and appropriately within a rehabilitation plan.","After hearing the news on TJ Watt, I wanted to share some info for those that are curious about what it entails. I’m a physical therapist certified in my state for dry needling, and I use it regularly in clinical practice.

What is dry needling? Dry needling is a treatment technique that uses a very thin, solid filament needle to target muscle, tendon, or connective tissue in order to reduce pain, normalize muscle activity, and improve movement. It’s called “dry” needling because there is no medication or liquid inside the needle. Unlike an injection, nothing is being delivered into the body. The needle itself is solid, not hollow, which allows it to be extremely small in diameter.

Because of this, dry needling does not cause the same tissue disruption, pain, or systemic effects that people associate with shots or injections. Most patients describe the sensation as pressure, a brief muscle twitch, or temporary soreness rather than sharp pain. The goal is to stimulate a local neuromuscular response, not to inject anything into the tissue.

In rehabilitation settings, dry needling is used as one tool among many. It is commonly paired with therapeutic exercise, manual therapy, mobility work, and movement retraining. In my own clinical experience, I’ve seen particularly strong results in conditions such as cervicogenic headaches, chronic low back pain, persistent muscle spasm, tendon-related injuries, and plantar fasciitis. In many cases, these were patients who had already tried multiple other approaches without meaningful improvement, and dry needling helped unlock progress when combined with other therapy methods.

Safety From a safety standpoint, dry needling has an extremely low rate of serious complications when performed by trained providers. Large studies show that major adverse events are essentially nonexistent in physical therapy practice. One study reviewing over 7,600 dry needling treatments performed by physical therapists reported zero major adverse effects. Minor side effects are more common and typically include temporary soreness, bruising, or localized discomfort. This is often related to the technique used. Physical therapists frequently use methods such as pistoning or fanning within the muscle to achieve a therapeutic response. The resulting soreness is similar to what someone might feel after an intense workout rather than a sign of tissue damage.

Concerns about lung injury are understandable but need context. Pneumothorax is a known but extremely rare complication. Many physical therapists are trained to avoid needling over lung fields altogether. In my own practice, I do not needle directly over thoracic regions where lung tissue could be at risk. When rib or intercostal pain is treated, there are ways to minimize risk, including shallow angles, anatomical positioning, or ultrasound guidance. Even when this complication occurs, it typically leads to observation or short-term hospitalization and is not life-threatening.

Training Physical therapists are extensively trained in musculoskeletal and human anatomy. The majority of PT education is directly connected to understanding muscles, joints, nerves, blood vessels, and how these structures interact during movement. This background makes physical therapists particularly well qualified to use techniques like dry needling safely and appropriately within a rehabilitation plan. I haven't yet seen what professional was practicing whether it was a PT or team physician but either way, both would be more than qualified.

For those interested in the research of major adverse effects:",,N,,2025-12-13 03:58:29.717522

He had a good week.
He did a good job, he's looking good.""
""He's doing a great job,"" Macdonald said of Young.","Injury Updates

The Seahawks will be without tight end Elijah Arroyo, who injured his knee last weekend, but are otherwise healthy heading into Sunday's game.

The Seahawks do have some roster decisions to make this weekend with several players back to practice who have not yet been activated to the roster. Center Jalen Sundell and tight end Eric Saubert, who have been on injured reserve, both returned to practice this week, while rookie defensive end Rylie Mills, who has been on the physically unable to perform list since the start of training camp, just wrapped up his third week of practice. All three players are listed as questionable for Sunday's game, but Macdonald wasn't saying which of those players will be activated.

On Sundell, who has missed four games with a knee injury, Macdonald said, ""He did good. He had a good week. He did a good job, he's looking good.""

Asked if Sundell will start at center if he is back this week, Macdonald said, ""We're going to work through the roster moves over the next couple of days. Kind of like (the Colts at quarterback), there will be a center out there on Sunday, I promise.""

Macdonald gave a similar answer on Saubert, who has been out five games with a calf injury, saying, ""Eric's also looking good. Doing a great job. Since he's made a turn here the last couple of weeks, he's really accelerated through, so Sauby's done a great job.""

If Saubert is activated ahead of Sunday's game, that would give the Seahawks added tight end depth with Arroyo out.

On Mills, Macdonald said, ""We practiced in pads the beginning of Wednesday, partially because he needed the experience, and he did well. He's looking good.""

Receiver Dareke Young, who returned to practice last week, practiced fully this week but has been ruled out.

""He's doing a great job,"" Macdonald said of Young. ""If and when he's activated, he'll be ready to go. He's doing a great job in practice.""

Macdonald also gave an update on rookie receiver Tory Horton, who is on injured reserve with a shin injury and is eligible to return next week.

""It's still a process right now,"" Macdonald said. ""We've got some tests going on—not as we speak, but in the last day or two—and that will be indicative of how fast we can accelerate everything.""

Shaquill Griffin & Cam Akers clear waivers, and 'hopefully they'll be back soon.'

Potentially needing roster spots to activate some combination of Sundell, Saubert and Mills, the Seahawks waived cornerback Shaquill Griffin and running back Cam Akers on Thursday. Both cleared waivers and Macdonald indicated both could be back with the team soon, presumably on the practice squad.

""It's really just roster management,"" Macdonald said of the moves. ""It's one of those things that's kind of a necessary evil that we have to do. To my knowledge they cleared waivers, so hopefully they'll be back soon.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/dcroyrrljc0utst7xqzp,N,,2025-12-13 03:58:37.294332

Cleveland listed five players as questionable: offensive linemen Joel Bitonio (knee/back) and Zak Zinter (back), wide receivers Malachi Corley (concussion) and Cedric Tillman (concussion), and defensive tackle Mason Graham (rib).

The Browns ruled out defensive tackle Adin Huntington (quad), running back Dylan Sampson (calf/hand) and quarterback Deshaun Watson (Achilles).

Watson remains on the physically unable to perform list, but quarterbacks coach Bill Musgrave said the veteran increased his workload in his second week of practice, which included running the scout team offense.

Gross-Matos practiced on Friday and is expected to be activated from the Injured Reserve on Saturday.

So we thought. Kyle Shanahan ruled Gross-Matos out. The 49ers are likely playing it safe with Gross-Matos and want to make sure he can get through a full week of practice before putting him out there. Here are the other players Kyle Shanahan ruled out for Sunday:

LB Tatum Bethune (ankle)

DE Sam Okuayinonu (ankle)

LB Nick Martin (concussion)

LB Eric Kendricks (calf)

QB Kurtis Rourke (knee)

Neither of the above four players practiced all week outside of Rourke, so it’s not a surprise to see them ruled out.

Christian McCaffrey was back at practice on Friday after being listed with an illness on Thursday. He’s a full-go and not on the injury report. Kyle Juszczyk was also cleared to play.

Wide receiver Jacob Cowing was seen working on the side of the field. Shanahan said Cowing is “getting close” to being fully healthy, and the plan is to open his practice window as soon as Cowing has reached that point: “He’s gotta pass a few more markers.”

Watt, a four-time All-Pro, hasn't missed a game in the last three years. He's on pace for his lowest sack total since 2022 – when he missed seven games – with just 7.0 through 13 games. Watt's made at least the Pro Bowl in each of the last seven seasons.

Here's what to know about Watt:

TJ Watt injury update

Watt suffered a partially collapsed lung on Dec. 10 and was hospitalized Thursday to repair it. His lung partially collapsed reportedly during a dry needling treatment.

This is not expected to be a season-ending injury for the 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year. He may miss Week 15 but should be back before the end of the regular season.

With Watt likely out, Pittsburgh's defense will rely more on rookie Jack Sawyer and/or Nick Herbig on the edge opposite Alex Highsmith against Miami.

What is dry needling?

Dry needling is a treatment for muscle pain or tightness that uses thin, sharp needles to target a muscle trigger point, similar to acupuncture but with fewer needles.

These trigger points are areas of tight muscle tissue that can arise due to various issues. By targeting these trigger points, dry needling can help by increasing blood flow and reducing pain.

NFL players can often have dry needling performed at team facilities to help with muscle soreness during the season. Watt's treatment not an unusual but it's unusual that his lung partially collapsed during treatment.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/12/USAT/87737218007-usatsi-27766345.jpg?crop=5721,3218,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-12 22:00:46.151187

The Colts will face the Seattle Seahawks and the NFL's leading receiver, Jaxon Smith-Njigba.

INDIANAPOLIS — Colts All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner will miss his second consecutive game Sunday as the Colts square off with the Seattle Seahawks, Colts coach Shane Steichen said Friday, leaving the Colts without both their starting cornerbacks against the top receiver in the league.

Gardner suffered a calf injury just two plays into the Colts’ Week 13 home game with the Texans, forcing defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo to hand off lead duties of guarding Houston’s top wideout Nico Collins, who went on to gain 98 yards on five catches, to fellow All-Pro corner Charvarius Ward. Ward gave up six catches for 112 yards that game when he was the nearest defender in coverage to Texans receivers as he continued to find his footing two games back from going on IR for his second concussion of the season.

Last week against the Jaguars, with the Colts still missing Gardner, Ward gave up three catches for 64 yards on seven targets while the nearest defender in coverage. But the next day, he alerted the coaching staff to concussion symptoms that had cropped up again, and the Colts put him on IR this week, keeping the team’s offseason free agent signing out for the rest of the regular season.

The Colts, notably, didn’t put Gardner on IR after the Texans game, leaving hope he’d be back within a couple weeks with his calf injury, but Steichen said Wednesday ahead of practice that Gardner would not be back on the field that day, and he didn’t participate in practice again Thursday, leaving it unlikely he’d be expected to make his return in Seattle.

Without either Gardner or Ward for Sunday, the Colts will have to lean heavily on the cornerback-by-committee approach they used during Ward’s first stint on IR in Weeks 6 through 9 before the team traded for Gardner, including some combination of Mekhi Blackmon, Jaylon Jones, Jonathan Edwards and Cameron Mitchell alongside slot corner Kenny Moore II and starting safeties Nick Cross and Cam Bynum.

Their task? Finding a way to limit the league’s leading receiver, Seattle’s Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who until a couple weeks ago was tracking toward the NFL’s single-season receiving yards record. Through 13 games, he has 89 catches for 1,428 yards, nearly 150 yards more than second best, Rams’ Puka Nacua with 1,186 yards. The NFL’s all-time mark was set in 2012 by the Lions’ Calvin Johnson, who logged 1,964 yards in 16 games.

At his pace, Smith-Njigba is tracking toward 1,867 yards in 17 games, or 1,758 yards in a 16-game set comparable to Johnson’s record-setting year.

After going for eight catches for 167 yards in Week 12 at Tennessee, Smith-Njigba caught just two passes for 24 yards against Minnesota the following week, before getting seven catches for 92 yards at Atlanta a week ago.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/30/PIND/87541668007-113025-colts-texans-0119.jpg?crop=7004,3941,x0,y364&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-12 22:00:50.873470

Cornerback Christian Benford suffered a toe injury during practice Thursday and will not practice Friday. Obviously, that’s a titanic injury for the Bills as Benford has been one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL during the second half of this season.

“It was a normal practice play, tweaked his toe,” coach Sean McDermott said. “I don’t feel like it is (a long-term type of injury), but we’re only 24 hours out from it, or even less, so we’re still gathering information still. It is frustrating, but at the same time it’s next man up, we’ve been doing that all year. I’m confident that somebody will step up as needed.”

Benford will likely be listed as questionable for the game, meaning it’s going to be a 50-50 call depending on how he feels in the pregame. If Benford can’t play, the Bills would have to go with Tre’Davious White and Maxwell Hairston as their starters.

And because they lost Ja’Marcus Ingram to the Houston Texans thanks to the Darius Slay fiasco, the Bills are shorthanded at the position and would probably have to call up Dane Jackson from the practice squad to provide depth.

Winger Watson, 19, has yet to start in the league due to adaptation and injury niggles since a £10m move from Sunderland in the summer.
Hurzeler revved up for the Liverpool game with a visit on Thursday to the headquarters in Woking of Formula 1 motor racing team McLaren.","Brighton & Hove Albion’s January window plans could be affected by the absence of Stefanos Tzimas for the rest of the season with a ruptured anterior cruciate knee ligament (ACL) injury.

The club normally uses the January window for signings for the future rather than immediate needs, as was the case earlier this year when Tzimas was bought from Nurnberg for around £20million and loaned straight back to the German club for the rest of the season.

The 19-year-old Greek prospect has been ruled out for the rest of the season by the injury sustained on his full Premier League debut in the recent 4-3 home defeat by Aston Villa.

Hurzeler, asked by The Athletic during his press conference for Saturday’s visit to Liverpool whether an extra striker in January is now a priority, said: “It can be, yes, but regarding the transfers I always emphasise that we will make decisions together (with owner Tony Bloom and the recruitment team). So, we are in exchange, we try to understand the situation, what do we need and then try to find the best solution.”

Evan Ferguson, who scored twice against Celtic in the Europa League on Thursday, would not be a like-for-like replacement for Tzimas and the terms for both clubs of the Irish striker’s loan to Roma for the rest of the season are unclear. “Evan is our player, so that’s why he will always be an option.

“Of course, now at the moment he’s on loan, but we follow it, we are pleased how he performed yesterday.”

Former Liverpool stalwart James Milner, Kaoru Mitoma, Yasin Ayari and Tommy Watson are all back in contention for the trip to Anfield. Milner, 39, has been sidelined by a muscle injury since a 4-2 defeat at Manchester United in October. Japan winger Mitoma has been missing with an ankle injury since a 3-1 win at Chelsea in September.

Sweden international midfielder Ayari has sat out the last two matches against Villa and Sunday’s 1-1 home draw with West Ham.

Winger Watson, 19, has yet to start in the league due to adaptation and injury niggles since a £10m move from Sunderland in the summer.

Hurzeler revved up for the Liverpool game with a visit on Thursday to the headquarters in Woking of Formula 1 motor racing team McLaren. He said: “I think that McLaren hold the record for the fastest pit stop, 1.8 seconds. I was asking them about it and I liked their response.

“They said they value the consistency in our pit stop always being about 2.3, 2.4 seconds. It’s not about big results, it’s about having consistency in performances. They are very aligned with our values here, so therefore I quite enjoyed it and we will definitely stay in touch, try to learn from each other.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/12064713/GettyImages-2248666376-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-12 22:01:08.383593

Running back Terrell Jennings has been ruled out for the AFC East rematch due to a concussion, as head coach Mike Vrabel confirmed during his final press conference of the week. And on the other side of the ball in Foxborough, defensive captain Robert Spillane moves forward as the team’s lone questionable.

Here’s the rest of the game statuses leading up to Sunday’s 1 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.

OUT

Patriots

RB Terrell Jennings (concussion)

Bills

No players listed

Jennings remained a non-participant through three consecutive injury reports before officially being ruled out. The 2024 undrafted arrival out of Florida A&M entered the NFL’s concussion protocol against the New York Giants as the calendar turned to December. The running back depth chart will now be subject to movement behind starter Rhamondre Stevenson and reigning AFC Offensive Rookie of the Month TreVeyon Henderson. Veteran D’Ernest Johnson, a three-time standard elevation from the practice squad, is on track to join the 53-man roster. That will require a corresponding move by 4 p.m. ET on Saturday.

“Yeah, D’Ernest will probably get to the game and help us,” New England’s head coach said. “We’ll have to figure some things out now, this afternoon or tomorrow, with the roster.”

QUESTIONABLE

Patriots

LB Robert Spillane (foot)

Bills

WR Joshua Palmer (ankle)

LB Terrel Bernard (elbow)

CB Christian Benford (toe)

The Patriots added Spillane to the injury report as a limited participant on Thursday due to a foot injury. A questionable tag followed on Friday. The off-ball linebacker had seen his workload scale back to a season-low 38 defensive downs during his latest start. He ranks atop the unit with 97 tackles while also having a hand in one sack, one forced fumble, five passes defensed and two interceptions returned for 70 yards. Only cornerback Carlton Davis III and safety Craig Woodson have logged a higher rate of snaps for New England’s defense than his 95.36 percent.

But guard Jared Wilson, nose tackle Khyiris Tonga and special teams captain Brenden Schooler are set to go without game designations after landing among the inactives prior to the bye week. The same prognosis holds for swing tackle Vederian Lowe, defensive tackle Christian Barmore as well as outside linebacker and sack leader Harold Landry III.",https://platform.patspulpit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2025/12/gettyimages-2244892951.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C2.1001449919722%2C100%2C78.538867550777&w=1200,N,,2025-12-12 18:02:18.030846

Pro Bowl right guard Wyatt Teller (calf) and right tackle Jack Conklin (concussion) have been ruled out of Sunday's game.","Stevenson revealed that watching last Sunday's game at home was ""very weird.""

""I'm calling out plays, I'm yelling,"" he said. ""I woke my son up a couple times. I got in trouble for that. It definitely felt weird just not to be there with the guys and go out and feel that energy, feel that motivation playing the Green Bay Packers.""

Fellow cornerback Jaylon Johnson also was not given an injury designation after practicing in full all week. The two-time Pro Bowler will play in his third straight game after missing nine contests with a groin injury. Johnson played 61.1% of the defensive snaps Nov. 28 against the Eagles and 66.0% last Sunday in Green Bay.

""He's getting closer and closer [to full strength] each and every week,"" said defensive coordinator Dennis Allen. ""When you think about a guy that really hadn't played a lot of football basically in about a year, it takes a little bit of time to get back to where you need to be. He's working extremely hard to do that.""

While Stevenson and Johnson will be on the field together for the first time since the season opener, nickel back Kyler Gordon has been ruled out of Sunday's game with a groin injury that he sustained during pre-game warm-ups in Green Bay.

In other injury news, running back Travis Homer will sit out Sunday with an ankle injury and receiver Rome Odunze is questionable with a foot injury that limited him all week in practice and forced him to miss the Packers game.

The Browns, meanwhile, will face the Bears without three and possibly four of their five starting offensive linemen.

Center Ethan Pocic was lost for the season with a torn Achilles tendon last weekend against the Titans.

It’s a good sign to see him on the field because it doesn’t look like the Eagles will have Lane Johnson on Sunday.
Their top backup with Fred Johnson on the field is Matt Pryor.
Fred Johnson has started the last three games.","Some good news for the Eagles at their Friday practice:

Both Landon Dickerson (calf) and Fred Johnson (ankle) were full participants in Friday’s practice and are good to go against the Raiders on Sunday.

Dickerson missed practice on Thursday with an added rest designation after being listed as limited to start the week. Dickerson suffered a calf injury against the Chargers but was able to return and finish that game. Dickerson has dealt with several injuries this season and actually got a rest day off last week too.

Fred Johnson popped up on the injury report Thursday, which normally indicates the injury happened during practice. Johnson didn't appear to have any sort of wrap or brace on his ankle. It’s a good sign to see him on the field because it doesn’t look like the Eagles will have Lane Johnson on Sunday. Their top backup with Fred Johnson on the field is Matt Pryor.

Lane Johnson (foot) and Jalen Carter (shoulders) missed the entire week of practice and were the only two players ruled out for this game.

This will be the fourth missed game for Johnson, who suffered a Lisfranc sprain against the Lions on Nov. 16. The Eagles clearly thought there was a chance Johnson could return for this game because they didn’t put him on Injured Reserve. Fred Johnson has started the last three games. This is a big game for the right tackle because Raiders star pass rusher Maxx Crosby lines up on that side of the line around 87% of the time.

“He is a phenomenal football player,” head coach Nick Sirianni said of Crosby. “We’ve thought about him quite a bit this week. And that’s our job as players and coaches, to make sure that guys like that we think about and have a plan for.”

Without Carter last week, the Eagles’ defensive line stepped up and got constant pressure on Justin Herbert and sacked him six times. The Raiders have given up more sacks than any team in the NFL so this could be another big game up front.

Zack Baun (hand) has been a full participant this week and was back on the field Friday.

Long snapper Charley Hughlett has been listed as a full participant all week too. Hughlett will have to be activated off IR by 4 p.m. on Saturday. He is taking back his long snapper job after being out since Week 4 with a core muscle injury that required surgery.

Rookie offensive tackle Cameron Williams (shoulder) is listed as questionable. He would have to be activated from IR to the 53-man roster but that is unlikely to happen.",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/11/Johnson-F-USATSI-27572716.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-12 20:01:08.582687

While the Bengals were just fine without Higgins in the surprising triumph over the Ravens on Thanksgiving night, they can't guarantee the same will be true in Week 15. Higgins has proven to be an essential piece in the Bengals' passing offense, especially when Joe Burrow is behind center and distributing the football among a receiving corps that includes Ja'Marr Chase, Andrei Iosivas, Mitchell Tinsley and tight ends Mike Gesicki and Noah Fant.

In the three games Higgins has played with Burrow this season, he's led the Bengals in receiving twice.

Njoku was injured while catching a touchdown pass last week but has fallen behind Harold Fannin Jr. in snaps. Sampson's absence will mean a larger role for Jerome Ford. Teller's absence and Bitonio's potential absence could hurt the Browns up front against a poor Bears defense. Ward is a key piece in the secondary and will be missed. Tillman hasn't been as large a part of the offense recently as he was early in the season but is still a valuable part of the receiver rotation.

Gordon has played in only three games this year and missed last week against Green Bay. Odunze was limited in practice throughout the week after also missing last week's game against the Packers.

Bateman was a late-week addition and then downgraded to DNP on Friday, which is usually not a good sign. Washington practiced fully all week could be be gearing up to return from his extended stay on injured reserve.

Higgins will miss his second game in the last three weeks due to a concussion. Trey Hendrickson was placed on IR and is out for the year, so missing Stewart as well would be a blow to Cincinnati up front.

Harrison is out for the second week in a row and fourth time in the last five games. The Cards are beset by injuries in the secondary and potentially along the defensive line. If Demercado misses again, they'll also remain shorthanded in the backfield after they did not activate Trey Benson from injured reserve earlier this week.

If Chubb can't go, Woody Marks will again carry the load for the Texans. Bryant and Watson fully practiced on Friday while Speed was limited.

Brady Cook will start for New York with both Fields and Tyrod Taylor out. The tight end room could be depleted if Smartt joins Taylor on the sideline.

Davis is a valuable returner for the Chargers. Molden's potential absence could hurt on the back end while Pipkins' could force the Chargers deeper into their tackle depth. Johnston did not practice on Friday after being a full participant all week prior to that.

The Chiefs have had issues getting open in recent weeks, and the absence of Brown won't help their offense get back on track. Kansas City is again incredibly banged up along the offensive line. And McDuffie's potential absence would be huge if he can't go. He was limited after suffering a knee injury during last week's game.

Benford was downgraded from limited on Thursday to DNP on Friday, which is usually not a good sign for player availability. Both Bernard and Palmer were limited throughout the week.

Jennings' absence will leave the backfield work to TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson. If Spillane can't go, that could hurt against a Bills offense that loves to run the ball and use multi-tight end sets to hit defenses with play-action passes.

Daniels is not yet cleared for contact after aggravating his elbow injury last week. The Commies could be even more shorthanded if Rodriguez and/or Samuel can't play. Rodriguez was limited throughout the week and Samuel did not practice on Friday.

The Giants have all kinds of issues up front on defense, which could be exacerbated if Lawrence, in particular, can't play. Lawrence was a late-week addition to the report, which is usually not a good sign. They could also be shorthanded in the special teams department without their punter and possible their primary return specialist.

Kenny Pickett will start in place of Geno Smith. He'll have a depleted offensive line in front of him and could potentially be without the team's best blocking tight end as well.

Neither Carter nor Johnson practiced at all this week. They are massive losses on their respective sides of the ball.

Jacobs got in a limited practice on Friday after not practicing earlier in the week. If he's out, Emanuel Wilson and Chris Brooks will carry the load. Van Ness was limited throughout the week.

Denver could be shorthanded up front against the ferocious Green Bay pass rush. McGlinchey was a late-week add and didn't practice on Friday. Bryant's absence will thrust Troy Franklin and potential Lil'Jordan Humphrey into larger roles as outside receivers.

Detroit has a number of injuries in the secondary, specifically at safety, which could be a big liability against the Rams. The injuries along the offensive line could be damaging as well, against L.A.'s strong defensive front.

The Colts are very shorthanded on defense with their two best players out for this game. They'll also be without their right tackle in front of either Philip Rivers or Riley Leonard, whomever makes the start under center.

If Seattle is without both Arroyo and Saubert, that could hamper its ability to use favored multi-tight end sets. Sundell has been out since early November but got in full sessions late this week, a potential good sign for his return.

Joseph has apparently suffered a setback with his knee, according to coach Dan Campbell, and is now a candidate for IR. Landing in IR at this time of year would effectively end a season of frustration, where he’s continuously fought to get his knee rehabilitated.

“Kerby had a setback, so obviously, not as – don’t feel as good about that,” Campbell said on Friday

Branch being ruled out is a formality, as he has already had successful Achilles surgery and is expected to be placed on IR on Saturday.

LG Christian Mahogany (fibula, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 18

S Thomas Harper (concussion)

Vaki has been able to play through his thumb injury for a few weeks now and is expected to play this weekend, despite the questionable designation.

Raymond has been trending toward returning this week, and he should have a chance to be active on Sunday. If able to play, he should reassume his punt returner role and will contribute as a WR3 or WR4 option on offense.

Zylstra remains on injured reserve for the moment, but a questionable designation suggests there’s a chance he is removed from IR—likely this Saturday before the team travels to LA—and re-added to the 53-man roster. He’ll have a chance to step into a TE1 or TE2 upon his return to action.

Decker missed all three practices this week, which is mildly concerning, but this is something the veteran offensive lineman has done previously this year, so there’s still a realistic chance he can suit up on Sunday. It’s notable that “rest” was added to his injury report on Friday. If he’s not able to play, Dan Skipper would most likely step into the starting left tackle role, and his sixth OL role would be passed along to another reserve offensive lineman.

Mahogany has participated in three practices since his injury evaluation clock has started, and while it seems unlikely he’ll be activated from IR this week, the Lions have left the door open. Mahogany has said he doesn’t anticipate being in this recovery window for long, but it’ll likely be at least another week before he gets another shot to return to the active roster.

Awosika missed last week’s game but has been able to practice all week and will have a chance to start at left guard in this game. If the Lions feel like he’s not quite ready to return to that role, Detroit would then turn to Trystan Colon. Regardless of which player starts, there’s a good chance rookie Miles Frazier will cut into some of their reps as the Lions seem determined to get him more experience.

Harper has practiced all week, but Campbell wouldn’t go as far as to say that he’s cleared the NFL’s concussion protocols just yet.

“Harper will be out there at practice today, so feel pretty good about him, but we’ll see,” Campbell explained on Friday. “There again, I can’t give you a definitive right now, but that’s kind of where we’re at. So, we’ll be good.

If Harper is unable to clear on time—and with Joseph and Branch unavailable—the Lions will likely turn to Avonte Maddox and either Daniel Thomas or practice squad safety Erick Hallett.

“Look, Hallett’s been taking reps, (Thomas’) DT’s been taking reps, Maddox has been taking reps,” Campbell said Friday. “We’ve got plenty of guys. They’re getting valuable reps, so we’re good.”

The Lions also claimed Jalen Mills off waivers and signed Damontae Kazee to their practice squad this week, but the chances are neither will be up to speed enough to challenge for a heavy contributing role this weekend.

Anzalone missed practice on Wednesday with an illness, but he was able to return to practice on Thursday and looks ready to play against the Rams on Sunday.

He won't carry an injury designation into Sunday's game, so hopefully that signals the bye week did Landry some good.","New England is preparing for a huge divisional showdown with the Buffalo Bills at Gillette Stadium on Sunday, where a win would clinch the AFC East for the Patriots.

After having a late bye in Week 14, the good news is that the Patriots roster is getting healthier for the stretch run and arguably the biggest home game in nearly four years. On Friday, the Patriots listed only two players with game statuses: RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) was ruled out, and LB Robert Spillane (foot) is officially questionable. Buffalo listed CB Christian Benford (toe), LB Terrell Bernard (elbow), and WR Joshua Palmer (ankle) as questionable. DE Joey Bosa (hamstring/wrist) and RT Spencer Brown (shoulder) will play for the Bills on Sunday.

Starting on offense, the bye week did some good for starting LG Jared Wilson, who missed a Week 13 win over the Giants due to an ankle injury. Wilson injured his ankle early in the first quarter of the Patriots victory in Cincinnati in Week 12, playing just three snaps vs. the Bengals, and then sat out the game against New York heading into the bye. The third-round rookie has started 11 games at left guard in his first season, flashing his high-end athleticism on the move in the run game, and was starting to find a groove in pass protection. In his last two full games prior to the injury, Wilson had allowed just one total pressure vs. the Bucs and Jets.

Based on media access at Patriots practice, it seems as though Wilson will be reinserted into the starting lineup on Sunday after participating fully in all three sessions this week. With the rookie guard expected back in the starting lineup, the Patriots could start their fourth different offensive line combination through 14 games: LT Vederian Lowe, LG Jared Wilson, C Garrett Bradbury, RG Mike Onwenu, and RT Morgan Moses. Although injuries to their rookie starters on the left side have led to some shuffling, New England started 11 different line combinations during the 2024 season, so they've still had great continuity on the O-Line, comparatively speaking.

The other injury-related topic worth discussing offensively is who will serve as the Patriots third running back this week. With Jennings (concussion) ruled out, New England only has two healthy backs on the active roster, Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. On the practice squad, RB D'Ernest Johnson has already hit the maximum of three standard elevations, but head coach Mike Vrabel said Johnson will be moved to the active roster. The Patriots will need to make room on the 53-man roster for Johnson, with that move likely coming on Saturday.

Moving over to the other side of the ball, the positive injury update for the Patriots defense is that NT Khyiris Tonga is trending toward a return. Tonga also sat out the Giants game after suffering a chest injury Week 12 in Cincinnati. This week, the big nose tackle was a full participant in practice, while telling reporters that he ""feels good"" coming off some extra rest. Tonga is a huge part of New England's run defense and plays a small role on offense as a lead-blocker in short-yardage situations, which could help the Patriots slumping red zone offense.​

New England's run defense has been very stingy with Tonga, allowing -0.10 expected points added with its 335-pound nose tackle on the field. When he hasn't been available, the Patriots run defense is allowing an even 0.0 EPA per rush – a +0.10 EPA difference in favor of the offense, which is substantial. The Bills enter the week ranked seventh in rush EPA, led by star RB James Cook, who in many ways has become the engine of Buffalo's offense. Although most start with slowing down MVP quarterback Josh Allen, limiting Cook is arguably just as important.

Before the bye week, the Patriots run defense was slumping, ranking last in rushing success rate allowed in their previous four games (53.3%). Tonga's return and the rest of New England's defensive front getting some much-needed rest during the bye week will hopefully see the run defense return to form. In the first nine weeks, the Patriots ranked fifth in rushing success rate allowed (36.2%), so it's possible that the slump was just injury and lack-of-rest-related.

As for Spillane, the Patriots captain is dealing with a foot injury that led to him being a limited participant in the last two practices. Spillane only played 69.1% of the defensive snaps, a smaller workload than usual, in New England's last game before its bye week vs. the Giants. If he's limited again this week, the Pats leaned more on Jack Gibbens alongside Christian Elliss at linebacker.

Lastly, captain Harold Landry III continues to manage a lingering knee injury stemming from an injury scare during New England's Week 6 win against the Saints. Landry returned to Friday's practice after being limited on Wednesday and a non-participant on Thursday. He won't carry an injury designation into Sunday's game, so hopefully that signals the bye week did Landry some good. The Patriots have relied on undrafted rookie Elijah Ponder and vet Anfernee Jennings as depth on the edge.

By starting the season 11-2, the Patriots have played their way into an incredible opportunity to clinch the AFC East with a win over the Bills on Sunday. Buffalo has won the division for five consecutive seasons, dating back to 2020, but New England has a very simple playoff clinching scenario this week: win, and you're division champs. To claim the AFC East title on their own terms would be a massive accomplishment for head coach Mike Vrabel and company.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/ymquxjobw6gonahltpkn,N,,2025-12-12 17:05:07.713603

Watt has been ruled out for Monday night's game against the Miami Dolphins.

Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said he spoke with Watt on Wednesday evening, and said the pass rusher was ""comfortable."" Tomlin added that Watt was not dealing with an injury coming out of Week 14's game and that was he was unaware when or how Watt's symptoms started.

Watt, 31, has appeared in all 13 of the Steelers' games this season. He's registered 53 tackles and seven sacks in those contests.

While Watt has battled injuries in the past, he's been relatively healthy the past couple seasons. Prior to 2025, Watt played in 17 games in back-to-back years. He made the Pro Bowl in both seasons, earning a first team All-Pro nod in 2023 after leading the league with 19 sacks.

In July, the Steelers gave Watt a three-year, $123 million extension. The contract made Watt the highest paid non-quarterback in NFL history. That record has since been passed by Detroit Lions pass rusher Aidan Hutchinson.

Watt's absence at team facilities comes at a difficult time. At 7-6, the Steelers lead the AFC North, but their grasp on that spot is tenuous at best. The 6-7 Baltimore Ravens sit just behind Pittsburgh in the division. If Watt misses time, the Steelers would need to find a way to hold onto their lead in the AFC North without arguably their best player.

It’s alive!” Through two first-period power plays, the woeful Maple Leafs power play awoke with some of the most dynamic and purposeful puck movement we’ve seen this season.
Surely not, but something sparked the Leafs; they did not look like a team with a league-worst power play.
“Things opened up.” At the very least, the energy from all three of the Leafs’ power plays offered something to build off of.
The Leafs didn’t score on their first power play, but they did land four shots, most of which were dangerous.","TORONTO — The Maple Leafs had control of the game against the San Jose Sharks heading into the third period, but a potentially devastating freak injury and a swift momentum swing as a result cost them.

“We didn’t come out and dictate how to play the game,” Leafs coach Craig Berube said of his team’s poor third period, which he pointed to as the reason for the loss. “We turned pucks over, we were passive, we didn’t finish them off.”

After taking a 2-1 lead on the strength of goals from Dakota Joshua and Auston Matthews and the continued strong play of Dennis Hildeby, losing Oliver Ekman-Larsson to injury seemed to derail the Leafs. They looked sloppy in multiple shifts later in the third period, and some of their best players didn’t look at their best in overtime. The Sharks ultimately capitalized, coming back to take a 3-2 win in the extra frame.

“I still think we’re not where we need to be. We can be better. The third period showed that,” Berube said.

The Leafs managed a point, sure, but should they end up missing the playoffs by a thin margin, this loss feels like one they will look back on and regret.

Here’s more of what we saw:

Ekman-Larsson’s injury could be potentially catastrophic

Ekman-Larsson seemed to know right away that he was in serious trouble.

After colliding with Sharks forward Adam Gaudette in the third period, Ekman-Larsson’s left leg appeared to twist under the weight of a falling Gaudette. It looked like a freak play that happens often in NHL games, but the outcome here was much different and potentially, for the Leafs, much worse.

Ekman-Larsson could not get up and off the ice on his own. He required the help of teammates Calle Järnkrok and Morgan Rielly. Ekman-Larsson could not put any weight on his left leg. Once the Leafs defenceman left the ice, he continued to struggle to walk, using his stick to help himself to the dressing room.

“He’s got to be re-evaluated tomorrow,” Berube said of Ekman-Larsson. “I don’t know exactly the length of it.“

However, it was the look of resignation on Ekman-Larsson’s face that told the whole story: This did not look like the kind of injury that any player could recover from quickly enough.

“He’ll be missed,” Berube said, which didn’t sound promising. “Hopefully it’s not too bad.”

First, on Ekman-Larsson: If he’s out long-term, what a genuine shame. He’s in the middle of a great season and has been the Leafs’ best defenceman most nights. He has even been garnering some low-key attention for Sweden’s Olympic team, though he told me on Wednesday he wasn’t thinking about that whatsoever.

Next, on the Leafs defence: Man oh man, if you think the Leafs might be cursed, you are probably pointing to the injuries on their blue line right now. The timeline for both Chris Tanev and Brandon Carlo to return from their respective injuries is unclear.

Berube did say, after being asked by a reporter, whether Carlo had recently undergone surgery. Berube confirmed he did and that Carlo is expected to miss “about” a month because of it. What exactly Carlo had surgery on remains unclear.

Dakota Mermis is also out with a knee injury. Henry Thrun was called up from the Marlies to play his first game for the Leafs this season, and looked like he could have a job in the NHL.

Losing Ekman-Larsson could be potentially catastrophic for the blue line. The Leafs don’t have another puck-mover with his power-play capabilities and experience.

Marshall Rifai is practicing in a red no-contact jersey after a wrist injury requiring surgery in training camp. He could potentially be an option to hop on the back end, though when exactly that could happen is unclear. William Villeneuve is having another strong season for the Marlies and deserves his first NHL call-up, but he’s currently unavailable due to illness. The Marlies hope to know more about his return next week.

Look to the Leafs to likely call up Matt Benning, a right-shot defenceman who was an NHL regular as recently as 2022-23.

If Ekman-Larsson’s injury is serious, the Leafs would be down to three of their preferred top six defencemen for the foreseeable future. For a team that struggled to defend well early this season, they now have an even taller mountain to climb.

The power play is alive!

Cue my Colin Clive impersonation as Dr. Frankenstein: “The power play! It’s alive!”

Through two first-period power plays, the woeful Maple Leafs power play awoke with some of the most dynamic and purposeful puck movement we’ve seen this season.

Quick, quick, quick — that’s how the Leafs looked on the power play.

Is it just that simple? Throw the puck around with purpose and some aggression and good things will happen? Surely not, but something sparked the Leafs; they did not look like a team with a league-worst power play. Matthews scored the Leafs’ first power-play goal in five games thanks to a gnarly cross-ice pass from William Nylander.

“They moved it and shot it, moved it and shot it,” Berube said. “Things opened up.”

At the very least, the energy from all three of the Leafs’ power plays offered something to build off of. The Leafs didn’t score on their first power play, but they did land four shots, most of which were dangerous.

It needs to be said, though: The Sharks’ defensive positioning ahead of Matthews’ goal was ridiculously poor. The four players who left Matthews with that much time and space with their heads turned elsewhere are going to have that play clipped and shown multiple times in video sessions, and it won’t be pretty.

Joshua is coming into his own

After a rough start to the season, in which Joshua himself called out his own game, the offseason acquisition is starting to come into his own. His efforts against the Sharks stood out: Joshua was relentless in pursuing pucks, hounded the opposition with his size and got in the right spots to create offensive chances.

Was his game-opening goal a Mona Lisa? Hardly: Joshua got in front of Sharks defenceman Timothy Liljegren (and likely triggered some Liljegren haters in the process) and got a stick on a Jake McCabe shot. The puck bounced off Joshua’s stick and then off Liljegren and into the Sharks’ net.

Berube demands effort down low, in the ugly areas of the ice. There was more fearlessness from Joshua in his 15:03 TOI on Thursday than he’d shown in October and November. He has now scored three goals in his last six games.

Yes, some of his pop tonight was a byproduct of playing with Nylander — one of the best offensive players in the league — but Joshua looks to be finding his groove. From the outside, he appears to be playing with a level of comfort and confidence he struggled to attain in his transition to Toronto. It was on display against San Jose.

His third-period interference penalty wasn’t a great one to take. Still, an effective and forceful Joshua could continue to give the Leafs the bottom-six punch they need, even when Bobby McMann (serving a one-game suspension) returns to that line on Saturday.

Hildeby’s positioning is the best part of his game

The Leafs’ new No. 1 goalie put forth another stellar performance, including stopping a Ty Dellandrea penalty shot in the first period. It was how Hildeby stopped the shot, and 29 of the 32 he faced, that stood out: He rarely looked out of position. He’s using his 6-foot-7 frame to his advantage in a way he didn’t last season. He barely had to move to get a glove on Dellandrea’s shot; he read the shot the whole way. And when he did have to move side to side, there was an economy within Hildeby’s movements.

Hildeby can’t really be faulted for any of the Leafs’ three goals against. While Joseph Woll is trending toward being available this weekend after a recent injury, it feels like Berube and company should ride Hildeby’s hot hand against the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday.

Nylander and Nick Robertson respond to changes

McMann’s suspension led to movement in the Leafs forward group: Nylander was shuffled down to the third line because of a recent (minor) dip in his play, and Nick Robertson, after a recent healthy scratch, was placed back in the lineup.

Both players responded as Berube hoped they would.

Robertson was all over the ice, hounding pucks and setting up teammates with creative puck movement. Robertson was tied for second among all Leafs with three shots on goal, and at five-on-five, led all Leafs with three scoring chances, per Natural Stat Trick.

And Nylander?

“The best game I’ve seen him play in a while,” Berube said. “He was engaged. When I see him skating and handling the puck and keeping the puck and doing the things he did tonight with the puck, I know he was ready to go.”

Nylander logged two assists in 21:57 of ice time, his highest TOI in over a month. His stint on the third line is undoubtedly over, but it will be remembered fondly.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/11234855/GettyImages-2251272993-scaled-e1765514986369.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-12 16:02:42.454203

The Colts quarterback saw his season of redemption end in heartbreaking fashion when he tore his Achilles during Sunday’s loss to the Jaguars.

Jones wrote a heartfelt message to those connected to the organization after leading them to an 8-5 start.

“Thank you to my teammates, coaches, the Colts organization, and all the fans for the overwhelming support,” Jones wrote on Instagram, along with a series of photos from the season.

“Tough way to end this season but it has been an honor to wear the horseshoe and play for Colts fans. I’ll miss lining up with my guys, but I’ll be riding with them every step of the way. Go Colts!”

The question now becomes whether Jones has taken his last snap for the franchise — unless you think 44-year-old Philip Rivers is their quarterback of the future.

After a sad end to his Giants stint and a brief run as a Vikings practice squad player, Jones signed a one-year, $14 million contract with the Colts last offseason.

He won the starting job over Anthony Richardson and impressed — 3,109 passing yards and 19 touchdowns — under QB-friendly head coach Shane Steichen.

Jones, 28, had been setting himself up for a massive free agency payday with the Colts or another team.

However, his injury — which approximately has a nine-month recovery timeline — complicates things as it’s unclear if he will be ready for the start of next season.

Jones also has the baggage of a disastrous end to his Giants tenure, which saw him demoted to fourth-string before eventually being released at his own request last season.

The Colts pulled Rivers out of retirement as a Band-Aid as they try to resuscitate their once hopeful season.

Richardson is sidelined with a fractured orbital bone suffered in a freak pregame incident, but doubts about his future with the franchise goes beyond the injury.

The No. 4 pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, has been plagued by spotty play and losing out on the job to Jones was a glaring indictment on how he is viewed.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/daniel-jones-17-indianapolis-colts-116940447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-12-12 15:01:52.640282

Lamb returned to practice as a full participant on Thursday as his recovery has gone well enough for him to return for Sunday Night Football.

""Process has been cool. Obviously, it's been a lot of eye work and eye discipline and trying to, I guess, frustrate myself essentially to see if I have any more residuals of the concussion. And I haven't had any type of symptoms,"" Lamb said. ""As for me now, it's been heavy on rest, to be honest. Doing everything, me knowing my requirements, kind of getting ahead of everything, especially with the extra 2-3 days that we had off. I feel like that was big.""

Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt had successful surgery to ""stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung,"" according to his brother J.J.

Watt was in a dry needling treatment session at the team's practice facility on Wednesday when he started to feel discomfort. There is no timeline for a recovery, but he will be released from the hospital on Friday, according to J.J. Watt.

Other notable Week 15 injuries:

Cincinnati Bengals receiver Tee Higgins has been ruled out for Sunday's matchup with the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion. Higgins missed Week 13 with a concussion and found himself back in protocol this week after getting injured last week against the Buffalo Bills. Higgins was evaluated in-game and cleared to return, but Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said Monday that the receiver was back in protocol. He was limited during Thursday's practice and ultimately ruled out Friday afternoon.

The Washington Commanders have already ruled quarterback Jayden Daniels out for Week 15 due to aggravating an elbow injury in Week 14's loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Daniels had just returned from a three-game absence after dislocating that elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. Marcus Mariota will start his seventh game this season when the Commanders face the New York Giants on Sunday.

Trey Benson will not return this season after the Arizona Cardinals chose not to activate him from injured reserve during his 21-day practice window. The running back has been out since Week 4 with a knee injury. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Benson had not progressed enough to warrant a return this season.

Injuries to his right shoulder and back will likely sideline Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Geno Smith for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Kenny Pickett has been taking first-team reps this week as head coach Pete Carroll called Smith ""day-to-day.""

Higgins was evaluated in-game and cleared to return, but Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said Monday that the receiver was back in protocol. He was limited during Thursday's practice, putting his availability for Sunday's matchup against the Baltimore Ravens in doubt.

Johnson didn't practice on Dec. 11, so it's more than likely that he won't play against the Raiders on Dec. 14 with just one more day in the practice week.

But Johnson wasn't the only offensive lineman sitting out. Left guard Landon Dickerson also missed practice because of a calf injury/rest designation, and Lane Johnson's replacement, Fred Johnson, was listed as limited with an ankle injury.

Defensive tackle Jalen Carter also sat out practice. He's expected to miss his second straight game after having a non-surgical procedure on both of his shoulders.

Dickerson left the game in the first half against the Chargers on Dec. 8 with a calf injury, but returned in the fourth quarter.

Dickerson was listed as ""limited"" on Dec. 10, but that was an estimation based on a walkthrough practice. The Eagles had a full practice on Dec. 11. Fred Johnson was not listed on the injury report on Dec. 10, meaning that he likely suffered his injury during practice.

If both Lane and Fred Johnson can't play against the Raiders, Matt Pryor would be the likely replacement.

Fred Johnson has replaced Lane Johnson for the past three games, all losses. Brett Toth went in for Dickerson against the Chargers.

It's likely that the Eagles didn't put Lane Johnson on IR, requiring him to miss four games, when he first suffered the injury because it was determined that surgery wasn't required. That would have ended his season.

Instead, the Eagles took a chance that Lane Johnson could return before the four games were up. And really, Johnson, a perennial Pro Bowl player, were never going to fill his roster spot with a suitable replacement.

Which is why Arteta has reintegrated his returning casualties differently over the course of the season.

The return of multiple players in the same position has allowed Arteta to patiently reintroduce Martinelli and Madueke.
But obviously the fact that you are missing players, (means) you are loading other players more (as) a consequence.","At the start of December, Mikel Arteta said injuries had been “a theme of this season” for his Arsenal side.

After 15 league games, Arsenal have suffered that very same number of injuries, but as they are currently top of both the Premier League and Champions League tables, their lengthy list of absentees has largely been a subplot to the campaign so far.

November was a particularly bleak one in injury terms with up to seven players out at one point, and six of those being midfielders and attackers: Viktor Gyokeres, Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli, Noni Madueke and Martin Odegaard. In recent weeks, all bar Havertz have returned, with each comeback being managed differently.

It might seem players hit the ground running after a period out of action, like Jesus seemingly did in a 30-minute appearance off the bench in the 3-0 Champions League win away to Club Brugge of Belgium on Wednesday, but his return from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury is more nuanced than the Brazilian instantly finding form after an 11-month absence.

Players need time. These are human beings, not plug-in-and-play robots. Which is why Arteta has reintegrated his returning casualties differently over the course of the season.

For Jesus, there were seven months between the match in which he was injured and when he began doing on-pitch work again in August. At that point, some may have assumed his comeback was imminent, but another three months would pass before he played competitively again. He needed weeks of full training with the first team and two appearances in internal friendlies before Arteta deemed him ready, the manager pulling him back like a slingshot before finally flinging him onto the pitch in Bruges.

Asked if he could be as good post-ACL as he was before, or even better, Jesus’ answer after that midweek victory was unequivocal: “One hundred per cent.”

“It doesn’t matter about the chances I had (on the night),” he told reporters. “I got in good positions, I could finish the actions and hit the target. The three chances I had, I hit the target. Obviously, I had to score, but just to come back after 11 months and move the way I moved, I’m so pleased.”

After suffering a hamstring injury in the second game of the season, Bukayo Saka was out for almost a month before coming off the substitutes’ bench in the draw against Manchester City on September 21. Three days later, to the surprise of many, he was in the starting line-up for a Carabao Cup tie away to Port Vale of League One, English football’s third tier.

“He (Saka) needs minutes, and he’s demanding that as well,” said Arteta before that match, with the England international going on to play for an hour in a 2-0 Arsenal win. “Obviously, when he’s been out for a while, you just need to get in the rhythm. You need to get that confidence on the pitch and repeat actions and exposure.”

The need to find rhythm by repeating actions in-game would have been why Madueke, Martinelli and Gyokeres all started against Club Brugge, with their returns having varied levels of success.

Madueke’s direct running was what excited people early on in his Arsenal career following a summer move from Chelsea. Before starting on Wednesday, and scoring two of the goals, the England international winger had played 169 minutes from a possible 450 in the previous five games to build momentum and confidence. Similarly, Martinelli had featured in 144 of a possible 360 (four matches) before the trip to Belgium, but only looked comfortable taking on his man after the break.

Unsurprisingly, both finished the Club Brugge game having attempted and completed more dribbles than any other player. Martinelli completed three of his six attempted dribbles, Madueke two of his four.

The return of multiple players in the same position has allowed Arteta to patiently reintroduce Martinelli and Madueke. This could also help on Havertz too, with Arteta recently saying the German forward is now only weeks away from a comeback having been out since August with a knee injury, though he didn’t confirm whether that would happen before the end of the calendar year.

However, the manager hasn’t had the same luxury in other positions, something which has been particularly noticeable at right-back for several seasons.

“We don’t have time to train (because Arsenal play so many matches),” Arteta explained. “So training is not there. But obviously the fact that you are missing players, (means) you are loading other players more (as) a consequence. It’s a really dangerous circle.”

In Ben White’s first two seasons as a right-back for the club (2022-23 and 2023-24), serious calf and knee injuries to Takehiro Tomiyasu and Jurrien Timber respectively meant he started 71 of the 75 league games he was available for, sometimes playing through pain to do so. Come 2024-25, White required knee surgery in November. With Tomiyasu again unavailable, Timber was Arsenal’s fifth most-used outfield player last season. As the season was reaching its conclusion in May, he had an ankle operation.

If Arsenal beat Crystal Palace in a Carabao Cup quarter-final on December 23, they face the prospect of having a midweek game every week until February across the various competitions.

Before the 2-0 league win against Brentford last Wednesday, Arteta said the inability to train properly meant the focus between matches was “much more on principles and what we have to do, and then tweaking that in relation to the opponent’s strengths and weaknesses”.

Arsenal are about to have the rare luxury of a full week’s training, with seven days between the league fixtures at home to Wolves on Saturday and away to Everton on December 20 because of the postponement of that Palace tie due to the south Londoners’ ongoing UEFA Conference League commitments.

Once Christmas is out of the way, however, Arteta will need to ensure those who are returning from injuries are getting the right exposure to match action at the right time.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/11115214/GettyImages-2251248693-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-12 10:03:41.858093

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

No practice

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

S Kerby Joseph (knee) — Downgraded from limited practice

S Brian Branch (Achilles)

Decker typically sits out at least one practice each week, as part of his injury management program. And while missing a second practice is not unusual, it’s been a while since it’s happened, and it’s worth keeping an eye on.

Joseph returned to practice last week, but only practiced one day, while sitting out the other two practices. The All-Pro safety was already on the practice field on Wednesday this week, so a rest day on Thursday could be part of the rehabilitation plan. While this absence does not necessarily indicate a setback, it’s also not encouraging for his chances of playing this weekend.

Branch’s continued appearance on the injury report is only because they have not placed him on injured reserve. This is merely a formality at this point, as he has already had successful surgery on his Achilles and is clearly done for the season.

Limited practice

RB Sione Vaki (thumb)

WR Kalif Raymond (ankle)

TE Shane Zylstra (knee, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 10

LG Christian Mahogany (fibula, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 19

LG Kayode Awosika (foot)

S Thomas Harper (concussion)

Vaki’s thumb injury continues to limit him in practices, but he’s been good to go in games. If the thumb injury is a sprain, it could linger a bit longer, but if it’s a break, he may be dealing with this for the remainder of the season.

Raymond returned to practice on Wednesday after missing the previous two games. Special teams coordinator Dave Fipp insisted that once available, Raymond will return to his punt returner role, but also acknowledged Tom Kennedy has done enough to keep the kick return role. Raymond would also likely return to a WR3/4 role on offense, likely splitting time with rookie Isaac TeSlaa.

Zylstra has stacked another practice, and with the Lions releasing two tight ends in the last two days, the writing on the wall suggests Zylstra has a good chance of being removed from injured reserve and added back to the 53-man roster as early as this weekend.

Mahogany is just two days into his injury evaluation window and appears to be progressing well. While he has suggested he wants to try to return this week, the more likely scenario is that he would make his return for the Lions’ Week 16 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers or the Week 17 game in Minnesota.

Awosika missed last week’s game due to a mid-week foot injury, but his stacking two practices is a good sign that he may be able to return to the starting left guard position. Things are still a bit up in the air—will Awosika or Mahogany be ready?—but the Lions could always turn back to veteran Trystan Colon, who has started each of the last two weeks.

Harper has now practiced for two days in a row and appears to be on the right track to be cleared from the League’s concussion protocol in time to play on Sunday. With Branch headed to injured reserve and Joseph looking like he could miss another week, the Lions would really benefit from having Harper available.

Full practice

LB Alex Anzalone (illness) — upgraded from no practice

Anzalone didn’t practice on Wednesday due to an illness, but he was back at practice on Thursday, suggesting he’s on track to play on Sunday. Anzalone is a unique cog in the Lions’ defense, and with the Rams on the docket, Detroit will surely need his coverage skills.

,,2025-12-12 11:21:52+00:00,NFL.com,Week 15 fantasy sleepers: 10 high-upside lineup picks for playoff success - NFL.com,Marcas Grant,,,,,https://www.nfl.com/news/week-15-fantasy-sleepers-10-high-upside-lineup-picks-for-playoff-success,"Guys like Tyler Shough or Shedeur Sanders , who appeared in this column last week, have far tougher matchups in Week 15.
His 2.48 fantasy points in Week 14 aren’t inspiring.
But he could become the 10th quarterback to reach 15 fantasy points against Tampa this season.
Big Blue is giving up the second-most fantasy points per game to running backs.
He topped 20 touches in Weeks 11 and 12 and was on his way before the injury in Week 13.","And so it begins.

The fantasy playoffs are upon us. That went fast, no? It seemed like one minute we were hot-taking about whether Saquon Barkley was a first-round pick. The next, we were praying Saquon could just find the end zone one more time to help us squeeze into the playoffs.

(The answers to those existential queries were ""no"" and ""yes"".)

There now just three kinds of people. Those with a bye, those in the consolation bracket. And you. Because you, dear reader, are still lucky enough to have games ahead of you but not fortunate enough to get the week off. No matter. The Sleepers column is back with its first postseason edition of 2025. If you're just tuning in, well ... that would be weird. It's Week 15. Where have you been?

As always, I've got some alternative options to help you through a pinch. Don't worry, I'm not going to make a case for Philip Rivers. Although if the vibes around quarterback streamers continue to look this dour, I don't rule anything out.

Let's not think about that right now. Let's focus on the present. At present, your job is to survive and advance. That might mean some creative lineup management. And to help with that ... here are some names.

It’s a tough week for streaming quarterbacks. Guys like Tyler Shough or Shedeur Sanders , who appeared in this column last week, have far tougher matchups in Week 15. Anyone hoping to slot in Riley Leonard in place of the injured Daniel Jones will need to keep an eye on this week’s injury reports. So it is with much trepidation that I present to you Mr. Jonathan James McCarthy.

Last week, he crept into the top 12 thanks to three touchdown passes. But there have been more tricks than treats in his fantasy bag this year. However, Michael F. Florio pointed out on the NFL Fantasy Football Podcast that McCarthy’s worst games have come against either elite defenses or defenses seeing him for a second time. The Dallas Cowboys are neither. While the 'Boys are improved, they’re still prone to giving up big passing days. I wouldn’t recommend starting McCarthy outside of two-QB formats, but there is QB2 upside -- especially if the Vikings are chasing points in the second half.

Did I mention it’s a rough week for streaming quarterbacks? Because yeah. Cousins’ return to starter status has been snooze-worthy at best, stomach-churning at worst. His 2.48 fantasy points in Week 14 aren’t inspiring. Nor is the prospect of Atlanta enduring another week without Drake London . Above the protestations of many Falcons fans, the team is required by NFL bylaws to suit up and play this week. And so it goes.

Also struggling is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers pass defense. The Bucs have allowed the sixth-most passing yards in the NFL. In Weeks 10-13, they gave up an average of 290 yards per game. That feels like a tall bar for Cousins to reach at this point. But he could become the 10th quarterback to reach 15 fantasy points against Tampa this season. That’s enough to make him a QB2 in most formats this week.

Mitchell left last week’s loss to Pittsburgh with a knee injury. That’s the bad news. The good news is he is listed as day-to-day and has practiced this week. The better news is that Mitchell is coming off his best game since suffering a torn ACL in 2023. The best news is that he and the Ravens are facing the Bengals this week.

Mitchell did the most with his two carries, scoring a touchdown, when these teams met on Thanksgiving night, though game script forced Baltimore to throw more than it might have liked to. While the young back isn’t playing a ton of snaps, when he is on the field, he’s usually touching the ball. He’s also regained his explosive form, averaging 6.3 yards per carry (he averaged 6.5 yards per carry in his breakout rookie performances). Cincinnati continues to be the best matchup for running backs this season. Even with limited opportunities, Mitchell could have some flex appeal in deeper leagues.

First, let me start by saying that you can drop Jacory Croskey-Merritt . He’s still rostered in more than 50 percent of NFL.com leagues. Stop that. It was fun for a couple of weeks. But it’s over. The Commanders have turned to Rodriguez to lead their backfield and while that level of responsibility is a bridge too far for most fantasy managers, giving Rodriguez a spot in your lineup might not be.

Since Week 9, C-Rod (can we call him that?) leads Washington’s backfield in snaps and rush attempts. He also has a healthy 28 percent route participation -- even if the target share is woefully low. More importantly, he’s getting half of the team’s goal-line work. This week, he takes that up against the Giants and their 31st-ranked run defense. Big Blue is giving up the second-most fantasy points per game to running backs. Rodriguez doesn’t have the highest ceiling, but the matchup is favorable enough to make him a deep league flex this week.

We may have seen the rise of TreVeyon Henderson in recent weeks, but that doesn’t mean Stevenson has gone away. In the two games since returning from a toe injury, Stevenson has commanded nearly half of the rushing attempts and 75 percent of snaps in the two-minute offense.

Those numbers could come down a tick after the Patriots’ bye, but it keeps the veteran in play against the woeful Buffalo run stoppers. The Bills have looked better the past two weeks, but their 28th-ranked run defense has led to the seventh-most favorable matchups to RBs. Add Stevenson’s role in the passing game and he has flex value.

Despite leaving New York’s last game with a hip injury, Tracy appears on track to play after Big Blue’s bye week. Since the Giants lost Cam Skattebo , Tracy has maintained a healthy snap share and nearly 50 percent of the team’s rushing attempts. He’s also managed to carve out a meager target share as well. He topped 20 touches in Weeks 11 and 12 and was on his way before the injury in Week 13.

If styles make fights, then New York’s run-heavy offense should find the underbelly of the Commanders' 29th-ranked run defense. Washington has allowed a top-24 running back in four straight games. Tracy doesn’t have the highest ceiling, but he tops as a high-end RB2 in this week’s positive matchup.

What might have been for Pearsall in 2025. He started hot, leading the Niners in receiving yards through the first four weeks. Then a PCL sprain kept him out for six games. His return has been disappointing, to say the least. In three games, Pearsall has nine targets, five catches and 20 yards. Oof.

Whatever postseason aspirations the 49ers have will need to include Pearsall in some way. His snap share and route participation have been solid. The target share has been lacking. This is a good week to change that. The Titans are in the bottom seven in passing yards allowed to wideouts. The Niners offense has been disjointed this season, but if Brock Purdy and company can find a rhythm, Pearsall is in line for a big play or two. For managers in deeper leagues, he’s an upside flex.

The Titans offense is still a work in progress. But there have been some bright spots. Among them has been Dike. The rookie has made more of a name for himself as a return specialist, but he’s also flashed at times as a receiver. Dike has four weekly finishes inside the top 24 wide receivers. In three of those four, he tallied more than 16 points.

He matches up well against the 49ers this week. Dike spends more than half of his snaps from the slot. San Francisco has been one of the friendliest defenses to players in that alignment. Expect the Titans to be in the familiar position of chasing points in the second half. There should be plenty of targets to be had. Another top-24 finish for Dike wouldn’t be surprising.

It’s a rough week on the tight end front. The best matchups belong to guys who are bona fide starters and don’t belong in this column. George Kittle against the Titans. Tyler Warren against the Seahawks. Isaiah Likely against the Bengals. Or there are guys who are too much of a stretch to consider them in any situation. Are you really trusting your playoff life to AJ Barner , Chigoziem Okonkwo or T.J. Hockenson ?

That brings us to Freiermuth. He resides in the center of the Venn diagram with categories such as good matchup, decent usage and quality talent. The Dolphins have been tight end friendly this season, giving up the third-most points to the position. With Darnell Washington in concussion protocol, there’s an opportunity for Freiermuth to absorb some of his snaps and targets. Freiermuth isn’t a must-start but he could be a low-end TE1 in the right situation.

This hasn’t been a great year defensively for the 49ers. You’ve heard about it ad nauseum by now, but they’ve played much of the season without their two best defensive players in Nick Bosa and Fred Warner . Nonetheless, Robert Saleh has cobbled together a top-10 stop unit without a front four that causes many quarterbacks any distress.

The good news for San Francisco is that every defense has caused Cam Ward distress this year. The rookie is tied with Geno Smith as the quarterbacks who have been sacked the most in 2025 -- a mark Ward is likely to own by himself with Smith unlikely to play this week. One thing the Niners have done well lately is force turnovers. Saleh’s group has nabbed seven takeaways in its past three games. That jibes well against an offense that is above league average in giving the ball away. San Francisco is a solid streaming option for the opening of the fantasy playoffs.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/yg2jd7gyymmwfplnmsib,N,,2025-12-12 12:03:12.539472

Watt is in a local hospital for further lung evaluation after experiencing discomfort at the practice facility Wednesday, and his status for Monday's game against the Miami Dolphins is in question, team spokesman Burt Lauten said in a statement.

""He was experiencing some discomfort when he was at the facility yesterday, and so we took him to the docs and they're going through some procedures,"" coach Mike Tomlin said following Thursday's practice. ""He stayed overnight in the hospital. He has a lung situation that's being addressed. I think he has some testing and so forth ahead of him this afternoon, and that's all I know at this juncture.

""... His status for Monday night is really up in the air. I think what transpires this afternoon is going to provide more information for us.""

Watt's lung injury occurred during treatment at the team facility Wednesday, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter. Watt has been hospitalized since then, the sources said.

Tomlin said he ""got wind of"" the incident when Watt was in the team cafeteria at one point Wednesday.

""We know that he's doing better, but it definitely hurts when one of our teammates is in the hospital,"" said fellow pass rusher Alex Highsmith, who added that he has been in touch with Watt over the past day.

""... It's definitely a scary situation, tough situation. I've just been praying for him. I know he's getting better.""

The NFL Players Association is aware of the situation and has been in touch with Watt and his representation.

Watt had six tackles, including one for loss, and a quarterback hit in the win against the Ravens on Sunday where he played 68 (88%) defensive snaps.

The former Defensive Player of the Year and four-time All-Pro, who signed a three-year, $123 million extension in July, has 7 sacks, 3 forced fumbles and 1 interception this season along with 18 quarterback hits and 10 tackles for loss in 13 games this season.

Watt's status wasn't among the health concerns detailed by coach Mike Tomlin at Tuesday's news conference. Tomlin will provide more updates on Watt at the ""appropriate time,"" Lauten said in his statement.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1211%2Fr1588173_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 07:57:47.872321

Broncos tight end/fullback Nate Adkins (knee) and defensive lineman D.J. Jones (ankle) both practiced again on Thursday, seemingly putting them on track to return in Week 15. Jones sat out last week's game and Adkins missed the team's last five games.

Denver guard Ben Powers (biceps) has also returned to practice, opening his 21-day window to return from injured reserve. Alex Palczewski has filled in well while Powers has been sidelined, but Powers will likely reclaim his starting spot once healthy.

Elsewhere on the injury front, wide receiver Pat Bryant (hamstring) remains sidelined, giving him an uncertain status for Sunday. The Broncos' complete Thursday injury report can be seen below.

Denver will practice again on Friday before releasing a final injury report with game statuses. Sunday's game will be regionally televised on CBS (view the TV broadcast map). The Packers have a 1-7 record in Denver, but they are considered road favorites going into Week 15.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/10/SBRC/87708001007-dj-jones-broncos-injury-report.jpg?crop=4184,2355,x0,y217&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-12 09:00:55.480562
