Los Angeles Rams at Carolina Panthers (+10.5)

The Rams' secondary has been playing quite well but could be without an important piece here, while the defensive front could take a hit in the run defense department as well.

Carolina will be without its top cornerback, a significant issue against one of the best wide receiver duos in the NFL. The offensive line is also banged up, and the linebacker corps will still have a pair of absences despite the return of Trevin Wallace, who has no injury designation.

San Francisco 49ers at Cleveland Browns (+4.5)

San Francisco will have a backup kicker here and will also be down yet another linebacker with Fred Warner already out.

Things are fairly clean for the Browns, though they could miss Wright as a rotational rusher. If Ford can't go, the backfield will be entirely split between rookies Quinshon Judkins and Dylan Sampson.

Houston Texans at Indianapolis Colts (-3.5)

C.J. Stroud will make his return from a concussion for the Texans. The report is otherwise pretty clean.

Daniel Jones is good to go for the Colts despite reportedly having a fractured fibula. They report is otherwise pretty clean.

New Orleans will be without Kamara, which means rookie Devin Neal, who is off the injury report, will lead the backfield. Olave's potential absence would obviously be a significant burden for the offense to bear.

The Dolphins have been shorthanded in the defensive backfield all season. The offense could take a hit if Jackson is unable to play, but could get a lift if Waller is able to return from his injury.

Kirk Cousins will again be without his top wide receiver and could be missing the team's best offensive lineman as well.

The Jets have a fairly clean report here, but Brownlee and Phillips are important defenders for a unit that recently traded Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams but has played surprisingly well since doing so.

Arizona Cardinals at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (-2.5)

The Cardinals are very banged up in the backfield and could be down to just Michael Carter and practice squad players if Knight can't give it a go. They also have several injuries up front on both sides of the ball. Harrison was limited all week in his attempt to return from appendicitis. Melton got back to a limited practice on Friday after not participating on Thursday.

Morrison is a big absence in the defensive backfield for Tampa. Irving is expected to return to the fold and be part of a hot-hand rotation along with Rachaad White and Sean Tucker, per coach Todd Bowles, who also said Mayfield is trending toward playing. Nelson and Reddick are important pieces of the defensive front.

Brian Thomas Jr. has no injury designation and is set to return after his absence. The Jags are missing a couple pieces along the offensive line, as well as one of their best pass rushers, which could help the Titans keep Cam Ward protected for a change.

Speaking of Ward, he will be without his starting center, but could get some help in the receiving corps if Ayomanor is ready to return and Okonkwo plays through his designation. Woods is questionable after missing the game last week.

McCarthy is out with a concussion, leaving Max Brosmer to make his first career start. The Vikings won't have one of their starting guards in front of him. On defense, there are key potential absences at safety and up front -- particularly Greenard and Metellus.

It's a pretty clean report for the Seahawks.

Mayer being out means Brock Bowers will likely play close to every snap for Vegas. The Raiders are already down Jackson Powers-Johnson up front and could be without another offensive lineman. And it looks like there might be an illness going through the locker room.

Both Hampton and Ogbonnia are on injured reserve. Hampton isn't quite ready, but Ogbonnia might be.

Buffalo will be without one of its best defenders as well as its bookend tackles for this game. Those are massive absences.

The Broncos' report is fairly clean, but Elliss' absence would be a blow if he can't play.

Washington will again be without its starting quarterback and No. 3 receiver, but Terry McLaurin is off the injury report and will play.

New York Giants at New England Patriots (-7.5) (Monday)

The Giants announced on Friday that Jaxson Dart, who missed last week's game with a concussion, will start on Monday.

He said if the Texans' Week 12 game against the Buffalo Bills was Sunday, he would have played.
The Texans are only two games behind the Colts (8-3) and one behind the Jaguars (7-4) in the AFC South.","HOUSTON -- Texans coach DeMeco Ryans announced Friday that quarterback C.J. Stroud has cleared the concussion protocol and will start Sunday against the Indianapolis Colts.

Ryans is happy his starting quarterback is back under center. He doesn't want Stroud pressing and just wants him playing within the offense.

""Who's playing for us,"" Ryans said, ""whatever the position is, just asking everybody to go out and do their job to the best of their ability on offense. Play as efficiently as possible.""

Stroud was close to playing last week but the Texans played on Thursday. He said if the Texans' Week 12 game against the Buffalo Bills was Sunday, he would have played.

""I'm just grateful to be back finally,"" Stroud said. ""I'm grateful for all the prayers. To the Broncos' defense, hearing them praying for me, I really appreciated that... [Being out] wasn't fun, I wanted to play really bad. I wanted to be back out there, but we put ourselves in a great position.""

Stroud suffered a concussion against Denver in Week 9 and has missed three games. The Texans lost only the Broncos game during Stroud's absence while going undefeated in backup quarterback Davis Mills' three starts, which included two game-winning drives against the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tennessee Titans. Mills threw for 879 passing yards with five touchdowns and only one interception in his stint.

The Texans going 3-0 in Stroud's absence put them squarely in the AFC playoff race. Houston (6-5) is the No. 8 seed trailing the Bills (7-4), who they beat 23-19 in Week 12, for the final AFC wild-card spot. The Texans are only two games behind the Colts (8-3) and one behind the Jaguars (7-4) in the AFC South.

Last week's win over the Bills could be vital down the stretch as Houston has the head-to-head tiebreaker in the wild-card race over Buffalo, which trails the New England Patriots by 2.5 games in the AFC East.

The Texans still don't have much room for error as they have only a 38% chance to make the playoffs, per ESPN Analytics. Making the playoffs would take a historic feat to defy the odds.

Since the NFL expanded to a 14-team playoff format, 19 teams started 0-3 and only one made the playoffs. Ironically, the 2018 Texans were the only team to ever do it, and it was before the expansion to 14 teams.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0910%2Fr1543672_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 18:00:09.161668

Moving on to Jones' old team in New York, Jaxson Dart was cleared from concussion protocol on Thursday and will play Monday night against the New England Patriots.

Dart has missed the Giants’ past two games while in concussion protocol. He was injured in Week 10 against the Chicago Bears. Jameis Winston started in a pair of seven-point losses in Dart’s absence.

In Minnesota, J.J. McCarthy remains in concussion protocol and will miss Sunday's game against the Seattle Seahawks. Rookie Max Brosmer will start in his place. McCarthy reported concussion symptoms on the flight back following the team's 23-6 loss to the Green Bay Packers in Week 12.

McCarthy has already missed five games this season with an ankle injury. The concussion comes after a pretty disappointing showing from the Michigan product, who went 12-for-19 for only 87 yards in the loss to the Packers, throwing two interceptions. The second-year quarterback has not impressed much in his first real season, hitting only 54.1% of his passes with 10 picks and a 57.9 QBRating across six games.

Other notable Week 13 injuries:

The Patriots will be without rookie left tackle Will Campbell, who will miss the next four games after being placed on injured reserve. Campbell injured his knee during New England's Week 12 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. The team does not believe the injury is season-ending, which would be a sigh of relief for quarterback Drake Maye.

Baker Mayfield is trending towards playing Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals. After dealing with a low-grade sprained AC joint in his non-throwing shoulder all week, Mayfield took part in Friday's practice and head coach Todd Bowles said he looked good and looks ready to return after sustaining the injury during last week's loss to the Los Angeles Rams. ""He had to get well. He was very limited on Wednesday, he did a little more yesterday and he moved around perfectly today, so he's fine.""

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers will start against the Buffalo Bills, head coach Mike Tomlin told reporters on Friday. Rodgers missed last week's game against the Bears after suffering a fractured wrist in his non-throwing arm against the Bengals in Week 11. Backup Mason Rudolph relieved him after the injury, closing out the dominant win by going 12-of-16 for 127 yards and a touchdown.

""I just feel like I don't really have any tightness in my injury area,"" McLaurin said.","ASHBURN, Va. -- Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels was ruled out of Sunday's game vs. Denver with the dislocated elbow he suffered in Week 9, coach Dan Quinn said Friday.

But Daniels' return this season remains likely -- possibly as early as Week 14 at Minnesota. And the good news for Washington is that receiver Terry McLaurin will play for only the second time since Week 3.

The Commanders (3-8) host Denver (9-2) Sunday. Washington has lost six consecutive games in part because of an offense missing key pieces -- McLaurin in particular.

The injury to Daniels' non-throwing arm has caused him to miss the past two games. He did practice this week, but Quinn always considered him ""unlikely"" to play. Daniels was listed as a limited participant in practice each day this week.

Quinn called the week a ""great first step"" for Daniels. He has yet to be cleared for contact. Daniels has started five games this season but has been hurt three times. He also dealt with a sprained left knee that cost him two games and a right hamstring injury that sidelined him for one.

Quinn also ruled out receiver Noah Brown, who remains on injured reserve with a groin injury that occurred in Week 2. Starting safety Will Harris could be activated for Sunday after missing the past nine games with a fractured fibula.

McLaurin returned for a Week 7 loss at Kansas City, catching three passes for 54 yards. But a diving grab caused him to reaggravate his right quad injury. But he said earlier this week that he feels better this time around, having gone through multiple weeks of drills and practice without feeling any issues.

3 receiver Kalif Raymond because of an ankle injury and tight end Brock Wright because of a neck injury.","The Detroit Lions' margin for error to make the playoffs is dwindling, and it looks as if they'll enter the stretch run without one of their best offensive talents.

Lions coach Dan Campbell said wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown could miss the next couple games with an ankle injury he suffered in the Lions' 31-24 Thanksgiving loss to the Green Bay Packers.

""I don’t feel like this is long-, long-term, so that’s the good news,"" Campbell said. ""But that doesn’t mean it won’t be here for – it could be a week or two, maybe. If we’re lucky.""

St. Brown, who leads the Lions with 75 catches for 884 yards, injured his left ankle in the first quarter while blocking on a run play, when offensive linemen Kayode Awosika and Penei Sewell fell into the back of his leg.

St. Brown limped off the field with trainers after the play, went straight to the locker room and didn't return.

The Lions shifted offensive personnel in St. Brown's absence, using Jameson Williams as their No. 1 receiver and playing Issac TeSlaa and Tom Kennedy more in supporting roles.

Williams finished with seven catches for 144 yards and a touchdown, but the Lions missed St. Brown in other areas, such as blocking on run plays.

""When you lose a guy like Saint, it’s tough,"" Campbell said. ""There’s so many things that he brings to our offense. Everybody knows the production and the versatility he has, but also all the dirty work he does in the run game. All the little things, man. The nuances of where you line up to where you go, to who you block if it’s this look, to now if they go here you need to slide back to do that. I mean, he’s so fricking smart, man, and he’s tough. And so there’s a million jobs he does and he does them at a high level that it does, it hurts when you lose him.""

Complicating matters on offense, the Lions have already lost tight end Sam LaPorta to back surgery this year, and they played Thursday without No. 3 receiver Kalif Raymond because of an ankle injury and tight end Brock Wright because of a neck injury.

The Lions (7-5) host the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday, Dec. 4, in a battle between playoff bubble teams and then visit the NFC-leading Los Angeles Rams in Week 15.

They likely need at least a split in those games to make the playoffs.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/27/PDTF/87498454007-112725-lions-1-h-031.jpg?crop=3169,1784,x0,y164&width=3169&height=1784&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-28 17:00:20.192750

Mayfield suffered a left shoulder injury in the Buccaneers' blowout loss to the Los Angeles Rams last Sunday night, spending the second half wearing a sling while watching from the sideline. There was legitimate concern he might miss time as the week began, but after receiving positive results from an MRI and taking a cautious approach to most of the practice week, it appears Mayfield has improved enough to inspire optimism.

Well, a yard with 12 minutes to go in the first quarter is a little bit different than a yard to go with 10 seconds to go in the game.

Mike White concludes his week as Matthew Stafford As a scout team quarterback, Mike White is asked to be many men to many people.
""I was a Rams fan back in the day, and so you kind of have to pick,"" Canales said.
Are you going to be a Raiders fan or a Rams fan?
I was a Rams fan at the time.","CHARLOTTE — The Panthers are playing the league's hottest quarterback, and a high-functioning passing game, and they're doing it with a secondary full of questions.

In addition to suspended safety Tre'von Moehrig, Panthers head coach Dave Canales said that cornerback Jaycee Horn is expected to miss this week's game after suffering a concussion against the 49ers.

That's created a lot of new looks at practice this week, but Canales remains confident.

""I trust these guys to get it done,"" he said. ""And they had a great week of preparation.""

At cornerback, they'll have Mike Jackson starting in his normal spot, and Chau Smith-Wade and Akayleb Evans available to play outside. Smith-Wade has mostly played nickel since arriving here last year, but bumped outside last week when Horn and Corey Thornton were injured. (Thornton went on IR this week with a broken fibula).

Canales said they'd rotate a number of looks there. They also brought cornerback Robert Rochell off the Cowboys practice squad, and he has familiarity with the defense from his time with the Rams and coaches Ejiro Evero and Jonathan Cooley.

At safety, Ransom is at least close to a like-for-like with Moehrig, and they also have Demani Richardson, along with veteran starter Nick Scott.

""I mean, opportunities,"" Canales said of the replacements. ""This is something that, you know, Lathan has really been working on for a while now and so if you had a chance to be out there with Nick Scott communicating with him, Demani's been really a part of what we're doing. He's into it. He's ready to rock as well.""

Another week, another offensive line rotation

For those keeping count at home, this will be the 10th offensive line rotation the Panthers have played with in 13 games this season. Canales told reporters on Friday that Jake Curhan was expected to start at right guard in place of the injured Chandler Zavala.

""Pretty much the list of guys that we thought, we were trying to get back out there to see if we can move them around, we weren't able to do that,"" Canales said, listing Zavala among that group.

Curhan has played in eight games for the Panthers this season. While he hasn't started one yet, he has contributed on 15.4 percent of the offensive snaps in those games, including two games in which he played a majority of the game in place of other injured guards: the Packers in Week 9 and the 49ers in Week 12.

""Generally, Jake is a really intelligent guy and understands our schemes, what we're trying to get done,"" said Canales on Friday. The coach and player spent two years together in Seattle when Curhan was signed there after college. He's got a lot of experience, so different fronts, different types of movement, he's used to those things. And then on top of that, he's massive.""

For reference, Curhan is listed at 6-6 and 316 pounds.

""He is a big man, and he's got great power in the run game and in the pass game. He sits tight and uses his hands, and that's what I've known about Jake for a long time now. Whether it was tackle or guard, just his ability to process the game and make the adjustments that are required during the middle of the game.

Mike White concludes his week as Matthew Stafford

As a scout team quarterback, Mike White is asked to be many men to many people. Each week, his task is to emulate that week's opponent to the best of his ability. That means not only playbook, but tendencies at the line, cadences, and even how a quarterback breaks the huddle.

This week, White—who has been in the league for eight years—was cast as 17-year vet Matthew Stafford.

""He did an excellent job and (defensive coordinator) Ejiro (Evero) was very complimentary of Mike and Andy Dalton for being able to try to replicate the speed of play,"" Canales said of the quarterback's response to Stafford's play style.

The Rams are famous for playing lightning fast, even before the ball is snapped. It was something the Panthers' defense had to prepare for this week, and White handled the speed well.

""How they break the huddle, how they get up to the line, the shifts and motions all have to be really crisp, and our guys did a great job all across the board for a couple of days,"" Canales bragged. ""Really appreciative of our scout team, making that come to life because we have to be ready for that pace.""

Dave Canales grew up a Rams fan

Panthers quarterback Bryce Young grew up in Southern California, and he remembers the Rams coming back to Los Angeles in 2016 when he was in high school.

Dave Canales, being a little older, remembers them leaving when he was 13 years old.

Canales said rather than letting his Rams fandom follow to St. Louis when the team left after the 1994 season (just in time for the Panthers to join them in the NFC West).

""I was a Rams fan back in the day, and so you kind of have to pick,"" Canales said. ""You're in LA. Are you going to be a Raiders fan or a Rams fan? I was a Rams fan at the time. That was Jim Everett, and that whole crew. So I remember them leaving and I remember just being so pissed.

""At the time, Dan Marino was my favorite player. So once the Rams left LA, I was like, all right, well I think I'm a Dolphins fan now because I've always followed Dan. And so there was a little back and forth. But to get the Rams back in LA meant a lot for the community and all the people that were still rocking their Rams stuff for my whole childhood.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/panthers/q5nsv0ivmyhu6kispbmx,N,,2025-11-28 17:00:41.717569

After placing defensive tackle Milton Williams, cornerback Alex Austin and then left tackle Will Campbell on injured reserve, the sidelined list remained lengthy for the Patriots. Head coach Mike Vrabel said Wednesday that he “can pretty much guarantee” Wilson will also not be back at left guard for Monday night in Foxborough. The No. 95 overall pick had been carted from the blue medical tent to the locker room on the first drive last weekend due to a high ankle sprain. Later on in what became a 26-20 win at Paycor Stadium, the starting line also briefly lost its veteran right tackle due to an illness. In the kicking game, meanwhile, captain Brenden Schooler went from questionable to out at halftime with an ankle injury of his own. The reigning Pro Bowler and first-team All-Pro has not missed a game since the finale of the 2022 season. He stands with a team-high 77.2 percent of the snaps on special teams this fall.

New England would have moved forward with four partial participants based on Wednesday’s work. Count Henry among them. The captain at tight end, who is dealing with a toe injury, caught seven passes for a career-high 115 yards and one touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals. And across the line of scrimmage, an offseason award winner is dealing with a chest injury. Tonga was held to a season-low 12 defensive snaps last weekend because of it.

Here's what some of them are predicting will occur on Sunday when the Bucs and Cardinals battle it out:","The 6-5 Tampa Bay Buccaneers begin a three-game homestand on Sunday afternoon as the 3-8 Arizona Cardinals visit Raymond James Stadium. The Cardinals possess a high-octane passing attack behind Jacoby Brissett and have only suffered two losses by more than four points. The Buccaneers are trying to get back on track after a three-game losing skid. To find out how to watch, listen and livestream the game, click here.

The top concern among nearly all NFL analysts regarding Sunday's game is the health of Baker Mayfield. That uncertain situation has led some to believe the Bucs are in danger of a fourth straight loss, though others contend that Teddy Bridgewater would do just fine n Mayfield's absence. One expert who picked the Bucs think they will lean on an improving run game and will combine that with more inspired defensive play than in recent weeks. Of course, that defensive performance of late is a sticking point for some analysts, one of whom pointed out that the Bucs have allowed the most touchdown passes and the third-worst passing EPA over the past three weeks. The return of Bucky Irving gives some experts more faith in the Bucs' Week 13 fate. And the Cardinals' long trip east plus an early kickoff time factored into the equation for at least one analyst.

""Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield suffered a shoulder sprain Sunday night that puts his status in doubt for this one. That means it could be Teddy Bridgewater. He is more than capable. The Cardinals have had success with Jacoby Brissett throwing it, but they are one-dimensional. The Tampa Bay defense wasn't good against the Rams, but I think they bounce back here. Bucs take it.""

The Buccaneers are 3.0-point favorites at home and are generally favored by the experts, though there are plenty of dissenters.

That's a positive for Jackson, who will have additional time to rest his body after playing on Thursday night.","This wasn't how it was supposed to look for Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens on Thanksgiving, a mistake-filled 32-14 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals that snapped a five-game winning streak and squandered their lead atop the AFC North. The two-time MVP lost two fumbles and threw an interception for the Ravens, who turned it over five times and struggled to make plays against the Bengals, who had lost four straight coming in.

""I've just got to be consistent,"" Jackson said. ""Can't have turnovers in any game. Two fumbles and an interception. We got to be consistent. We're putting our defense on the field too much. Can't have that.""

Jackson hasn't thrown a touchdown pass or rushed for a score over this last three starts and has six turnovers during that stretch, the longest such streak in his career.

""I can't describe that level of frustration, I'm ticked off,"" Jackson said. ""I'm just mad because like I said, we can't have that. Turnovers is big part of winning and losing games. Turning the ball over and giving them extra possessions, this is the outcome.""

John Breech

Explosive plays haven't been there in recent weeks for the Ravens (6-6), who have relied on Derrick Henry to manage the heavy-lifting as the passing game works out the kinks. Henry has four touchdowns on the ground during the last three games, including the first score of Thursday's loss to the Bengals.

Jackson harped on his consistency issues and stiff-armed the notion that a litany of injuries has affected his play. He has missed time or been slowed by an array of ailments, including his hamstring, toe, knee and ankle.

""I feel like I missed throws ... I don't miss those,"" Jackson said after finishing 17 of 32 for 246 yards. ""I don't miss them in practice, I shouldn't miss them in games.""

Ravens coach John Harbaugh also insisted Jackson's healthy and he would not be in the lineup if that was not the case.

The Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6) now lead the division, but a loss to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday would push the Ravens back into first place thanks to the record vs. common opponents tiebreaker. Baltimore's currently 6-6 this season, which is 10th in the AFC behind the Kansas City Chiefs, who beat the Ravens head-to-head.

The Ravens won't play again until Dec. 7, when they face the Steelers in a pivotal divisional contest. That's a positive for Jackson, who will have additional time to rest his body after playing on Thursday night.

After a Thanksgiving loss to the Cowboys dropped them to 6-6, the Chiefs are sitting in a tough spot with their playoff chances dwindling.

Thursday’s 31-28 setback against the Cowboys has Chiefs ninth in the AFC standings, sitting 1.5 games overall and two games in the loss column back of the Bills, Jaguars, and Chargers, who are all 7-4.

Further hurting the Chiefs, who have made three straight Super Bowls, is that all three of the aforementioned teams beat them earlier this season.

“At the end of the day, you’ve just got to win every game now — and hope that’s enough,” quarterback Patrick Mahomes said after the loss with the reality beginning to seep through that the Chiefs may indeed miss the playoffs for the first time since the 2014 season.

The road to the playoffs seems even more daunting since injuries are all of a sudden starting to pile up for a Chiefs team that needs all hands on deck for the stretch run.

Rookie left tackle Josh Simmons, who was supposed to help stabilize an iffy offensive line, dislocated and fractured his wrist against the Cowboys and is likely heading to IR, per NFL Network.

Guard Trey Smith also missed the game with an ankle injury, while tackle Jawaan Taylor also exited with an arm injury.

The offensive line is now missing multiple starters, including both tackles, which will severely limit Mahomes’ ability to play superhero and shoulder the load for the Chiefs.

If the Chiefs want to take a shot at the playoffs, they will need to win out or come close, as the AFC is stacked with elite teams and 10 wins might not even be enough to get in.

Kansas City made the playoffs in all eight of Mahomes’ seasons as the starter entering the 2025 campaign.

“We’re going to play a lot of good football teams coming up,” Mahomes added. “If we’re going to make the playoffs, we’re going to have to win them all.”

The Chiefs follow this week’s tough loss with another incredibly challenging home game against the Texans, who feature the league’s top pass rush while Kansas City’s offensive line is at its weakest.

Houston, which visits the Colts this weekend, is the team directly in front of the Chiefs in the AFC standings and also on the outside looking in.

St. Brown will likely be labeled as ""week-to-week"" and will have time to recover with the Lions playing just once — Dec. 4 against the Dallas Cowboys — over the next 16 days

The injury occurred on the team's second drive of the day in a 31-24 defeat against the Packers. After going three-and-out on their first drive, the Lions took the field with 6:32 left in the first quarter. On the first play of the second drive, the Lions tried to run Jahmyr Gibbs to the right side.

St. Brown was a blocker on the play and tried to stop Packers safety Xavier McKinney from making a play. As the two were engaged, a Lions offense lineman rolled into St. Brown's legs.

St. Brown remained down on the field for a bit. He eventually limped off the field and went straight to the locker room. The Lions initially deemed him questionable to return.

Shortly after halftime, however, St. Brown was ruled out of the contest. He registered one target, but no catches, during the game.

With St. Brown, the Lions had to find other reliable pass catchers. For the most part, Jameson Williams stepped up, hauling in seven passes for 144 yards and a touchdown. Despite his efforts, the Lions couldn't complete the comeback against the Packers, losing 31-24.

Following the loss, Lions head coach Dan Campbell said the team doesn't expect St. Brown's injury to keep him out for too long, but it could sideline the star for a week or two.

The loss dropped the Lions to 7-5 on the season. While the team is very much in the playoff hunt, the loss could prevent them from winning the division.

It's appearing that defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt may have played his last snap for the team this season after sustaining a significant ankle injury against the Detroit Lions. He was rolled up on during a third-and-goal play late in the fourth quarter where Micah Parsons sacked Jared Goff, remaining on his back for several moments while the Packers' medical staff worked on him.

The replay showed a gruesome left ankle injury for Wyatt, who was ultimately carted off the field. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Tom Silverstein, Wyatt suffered significant ligament damage in the ankle. He's going to undergo more tests and an MRI once the Packers return to Green Bay, but the outlook isn't encouraging.

""Yeah, it doesn't look good, guys,"" said head coach Matt LaFleur after the game. ""I'm sick for him. I'm sick for us. That's a critical loss for our football team and for our defense, obviously.""

A former first-round pick, Wyatt is fresh off having the fifth-year option in his rookie contract picked up by the Packers. He's under contract in 2026 and he'll have an opportunity to rebound from his injury before signing a long-term extension, assuming that's the route general manager Brian Gutekunst wants to take. Barring any other additions, which isn't exactly out of the question, Wyatt should continue to be a starter along the defensive line next year.

Right now, however, the Packers will have to figure out how to move forward with someone as impactful as Wyatt. The fourth-year defensive lineman has four sacks through 10 games, including two in last week's win over the Minnesota Vikings.

""I can't say enough great things about him in terms of just watching him mature, not only as a football player but as a person,"" LaFleur said. ""I've got a lot of love for Devonte Wyatt and the whole locker room room does, too. It's bittersweet in regards to, yeah, we're happy about the win, but at the same time, we're sick about what happened to him.""

Wyatt's injury comes on the heels of the Packers trading away nose tackle Kenny Clark to the Dallas Cowboys in August. Of course, that blockbuster deal netted them Parsons, who, on Thursday, became the first player in league history to eclipse 12 sacks in each of his first five seasons. If Clark was still in the stable, the Packers may find it somewhat easier to absorb the loss of Wyatt, but instead, they'll have to scramble for answers.

The interior of the Packers' defensive line currently consists of Colby Wooden, Karl Brooks, Warren Brinson and Nazir Stackhouse. Wooden is already their starting nose tackle, so he isn't going anywhere. Brooks, meanwhile, is likely to take over in place of Wyatt, but he missed Thursday's game with an ankle injury. He played through the injury last week against the Vikings, but with a short turnaround between games, he was estimated as a non-participant in practice all three days leading up to the meeting with the Lions.

Brinson, who played 31 defensive snaps against the Lions, could be looking at an expanded role. The sixth-round rookie has been a healthy scratch for most of the season, but he's played in six games and led the team with five pressures against the Vikings.

Other in-house options to fill the void left behind by Wyatt are James Ester and Dante Barnett. Ester has spent each of the last two seasons on the Packers' practice squad and Barnett joined the team last month through the league's International Player Pathway Program. He hasn't played a single snap in the NFL.",https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/793/450/13450793.jpg?width=1200&height=628&crop=1.91:1&fit=cover,N,,2025-11-28 12:01:58.600625

The fourth-year pro had four tackles against the Lions, and has four sacks this season.

Detroit did get two starters back on defense against the Packers, who have one defensive starter back from injury in the lineup.

Lions cornerback Terrion Arnold and edge rusher Marcus Davenport were were active Thursday after being listed as questionable. Arnold missed the previous two games with a concussion. Davenport has been out with a shoulder injury since starting the first two games of the season, including a loss at Green Bay in Week 1.

Packers cornerback Keisean Nixon was active after leaving last week’s game with a neck injury.

Green Bay starting receiver Matthew Golden and linebacker Quay Walker along with reserve cornerback Nate Hobbs are out with injuries after being listed as questionable.

The Lions previously ruled out four starters: receiver and punt returner Kalif Raymond, tight end Brock Wright, center Graham Glasgow and safety Kerby Joseph.

Before the injury, Wyatt had four tackles (three solo), including one for a loss and was part of a defensive effort that kept a Lions rushing attack mostly at bay in the team's 31-24 win.

""I think you have to approach every week like you're going to start,"" said Anderson.
""D-Harm has been playing really good for us,"" said defensive tackle Cameron Heyward.","Before heading off for Thanksgiving dinner, Steelers players practiced at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex as they continued their preparation for Sunday's game against the Buffalo Bills.

Quarterback Aaron Rodgers was a full participant in practice on Thursday, the first time he has been a full participant since he suffered a broken bone in his left wrist against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 11 and went on to miss the team's Week 12 game against the Chicago Bears.

""I'm going to see how I feel after (Thursday), but I'm going to go (Thursday) and get casted up and then see how I respond,"" said Rodgers on Wednesday.

""I wasn't able to go last week. So, I'm hoping for a different outcome this week.

""I've had more days for the callus to form and more healing, especially Monday and Tuesday, just doing rehab. (Wednesday) I did a little bit more. (Thursday), I'll do a little bit more and see where I'm at come Friday.""

In addition to Rodgers, linebacker Alex Highsmith (pectoral), defensive tackle Cameron Heyward (ankle) and receiver DK Metcalf (ankle) were all full participants in practice.

Left tackle Broderick Jones left the Bears game in the fourth quarter with a neck. Jones has already been ruled out for this week's game.

It was Calvin Anderson who had to be ready at a moment's notice, stepping in for Jones and not missing a beat.

This week, Anderson knows he could be called upon again, but he is approaching the week the same as he always does.

""I think you have to approach every week like you're going to start,"" said Anderson. ""So, the good thing is I've been doing this for a long time now. And my approach doesn't change. And I'll be ready. If the team needs me, I'll be ready.""

Anderson, who is in his seventh season, signed with the Steelers during the 2024 season and appeared in four games, but finished the regular season on the Reserve/Injured List. He was activated and appeared in the Steelers Wild Card Game against the Baltimore Ravens. He was re-signed to a two-year contract in the offseason.

He is a player who understands his role, and in understanding it, knows he has to be ready.

""I've been in situations that are even more crazy than this,"" said Anderson. ""You have to approach game day, when you're a swing (lineman), being ready at any moment's notice. Just being able to turn it on. That's part of the preparation. And that way when the time comes, you can kick it off.""

The key for Anderson is balancing the physical side with the mental side of the game to be ready to go when called upon.

""I think it's a combination, but most of it is mental because on game day it's easy to just start getting into the flow of the game and check out,"" said Anderson. ""But you just have to be following the game and be ready to snap your body into playing, because at any moment the team will need you.

""And if the team needs you, you've got to perform so.""

Rookie defensive end Derrick Harmon has also been ruled out.

""D-Harm has been playing really good for us,"" said defensive tackle Cameron Heyward. ""Heavy hands. Just understanding. Even at a young age he understands the defense. Defensive line play. A lot of his counterparts.

""It's up to other guys to step up. Me and Keeanu (Benton) have to pick up our levels of play as well. When we have these opportunities where other guys are stepping in, it's usually by a group of guys, not just one guy.""

With Harmon out, expect to see a lot more of fifth-round pick Yahya Black. Black has also made a fast impression on the defense, picking things up quickly.

""I think Yahya is ready,"" said Heyward. ""Yahya is getting more comfortable in his alignment, playing with better extension. He's coming away with some big plays for us. That fumble (vs. Chicago). He just ripped it from the guy's arms. You need that from your young guys who are continuing to learn.

Anonymous: The answer to the whiparound question “what can stop the Ravens from winning the division?” is the Ravens.","Buoyed by the return of quarterback Joe Burrow, the Cincinnati Bengals have beaten the Baltimore Ravens 32-14 on Thanksgiving.

Playing for the first time since Week 2 after recovering from a toe injury, Burrow threw for 261 yards and two touchdowns.

His counterpart Lamar Jackson had a much tougher night, completing just over half of his pass attempts (17-for-32) and committing three of Baltimore’s five turnovers on the night.

Cincinnati snapped a four-game losing streak to improve to 4-8, while Baltimore saw its five-game winning streak end and fell to 6-6.

Despite the five-game winning streak and their ascension into a first-place tie in the AFC North, the reality for these Ravens was that the 1-5 start left them with little margin for error and they were always one loss away from being in trouble again. That the loss came Thursday to a divisional foe makes things even tougher. Obviously, it would really help the Ravens’ cause if the Steelers (6-5) lose Sunday to Buffalo. But regardless of that result, the Ravens probably are going to need to win their next two divisional games — home vs. Pittsburgh in Week 14 and at Cincinnati a week later — to remain in the playoff mix. They probably can’t afford another divisional loss over the next two weeks.

The Ravens have been expressing confidence for weeks that they are going to fix their struggling offense, but Thursday has to be rock bottom for Jackson and this group. After scoring their first first-possession touchdown since Week 4, the Ravens went six consecutive drives (not including a late second-quarter kneeldown) without scoring any points against the league’s 32nd-ranked defense. Included in that stretch were two Jackson fumbles deep in his own territory and an Isaiah Likely fumble as he was about to go in for a touchdown. The Ravens were able to mount a few drives in the second half, but the damage was done. Their turnovers (three by Jackson) were one more than they had during their entire five-game winning streak. Jackson looks like a shell of himself. Beyond the turnovers on Thursday, he missed a number of open receivers. The Ravens aren’t running the ball consistently well and their offensive line has struggled all year. Struggling in back-to-back games against the Jets and Bengals defenses doesn’t suggest a quick fix.

Is hope alive for Cincinnati? Easy on that thought. The Bengals are still two games back of the Ravens and need a Steelers loss Sunday against the Bears, but they aren’t dead. The AFC North tiebreaker would be a necessity, and they are 3-1 in the division this year with home games against the Ravens and Browns remaining. Again, the percentages are minuscule as they head to see Josh Allen and the Bills next week, but they still have a glimmer of hope. And they have Burrow.

While all the attention focused on Burrow’s return, it was instead the return of turnovers and an opportunistic Bengals defense that altered the dynamic of this game. The Bengals came into the game having forced just 10 turnovers all season, yet walked away with five against the Ravens.

This collection of young players, which has put together the worst first 11 games of any defense in history by DVOA, were making hustle and splash plays to suggest real tangible growth. Jordan Battle hustled after getting beaten to strip Isaiah Likely just before he crossed the goal line. Myles Murphy chased down Derrick Henry on a 43-yard reception, then blew up the pocket with a batted pass for a Demetrius Knight Jr. interception. Joseph Ossai broke free for two sacks, including a strip sack. This was the first time the Bengals allowed less than 26 points since the season opener. Hard to know how much of this correlated to Lamar Jackson’s struggles versus the Bengals’ improvement, but it has felt all year like a performance of this nature was impossible. Maybe the tide is finally turning for the Cincinnati defense.

There was no easing Joe Burrow back into action. He threw the second-most first-half passes of any game in his career (32) and the most by any quarterback this season. The work before halftime knocked the rust off, though, as he connected on impressive touchdown passes to Hudson and Iosivas, offering up big reactions with the competitive juices fully flowing in the second half. Burrow still often showed hesitation going off-script outside of the pocket, but was comfortable moving and hopping around while inside it. Timing routes were off, specifically inside the red zone, where the Bengals kicked three field goals, endured a goal-line stand and saw Burrow finish 2 of 12 for 18 yards and one touchdown. Still, the Bengals only punted twice all night and scored 17 points on their first three possessions after halftime to put the game away. When Burrow is playing, the energy and belief level rise for this club, and that proved true again in this game.

Bradley S.: Maybe one year we can see Burrow healthy for a full season and see what he can do in the playoffs. Such a shame it’s another waste of a season.

David H.: The entire AFC North should be declared ineligible for the playoffs. Signed, a Steeler fan.

Anonymous: The answer to the whiparound question “what can stop the Ravens from winning the division?” is the Ravens.

Justin G.: Ravens have never had an answer for Chase. Dude absolutely burns them every single game.

Phil W.: Lack of pass rush hurts Baltimore again. We just need to realize we are not a very good team this year.

Justin G.: Ravens need to really do some soul searching in the offseason. That starts with re-examining Harbaugh and Lamar. Injured or not, Lamar isn’t even a top-15 QB right now, let alone an elite one.

It wasn't the case in first quarter as Amon-Ra St. Brown went down with an injury. The Lions' star receiver was able to walk off the field, but went into the locker room with 6:12 remaining.

St. Brown is one of the Lions' irreplaceable players, meaning his absence will certainly be felt on offense. The receiver was rolled up on during a running play for Jahmyr Gibbs.

Here's the latest on St. Brown.

Amon-Ra St. Brown injury update

St. Brown's injury doesn't look like a long-term issue, according to Lions head coach Dan Campbell.

The coach added that they would know more on Nov. 28, saying that their star receiver could miss a week or two if they're lucky.

St. Brown was ruled out for the remainder of the Lions' Thanksgiving game with an ankle injury after being initially listed as questionable to return.

The receiver walked to the locker room after multiple Lions players rolled up on him during the first quarter.

He appeared to be walking with a slight limp, but required no assistance from medical staff. St. Brown is the clear WR1 in Detroit's offense that is already without another key pass-catching option in Sam LaPorta.

It leaves Dan Campbell's team thin on potential targets, but they are better equipped to handle it than most, thanks to a top running back duo of Gibbs and Davis Montgomery.

Coach Nick Sirianni and quarterback Jalen Hurts emphasize that finding ways to win is more important than committing to a specific offensive identity.

PHILADELPHIA − It was simple for the Eagles in 2024. Get a lead. Give the ball to Saquon Barkley. Run out the clock.

That run-first identity took the Eagles to the Super Bowl.

But that hasn't been the case this season. The Eagles have taken leads, given the ball to Barkley, only to get stopped. Against the Cowboys on Nov. 23, the Eagles passed their way to a 21-0 lead early in the second quarter.

Then they tried involving Barkley and the running game. It didn't work. The Eagles didn't score another point while the Cowboys won 24-21. Barkey had just 22 yards on 10 carries.

That has led to much hand-wringing about Barkley. One season after rushing for 2,005 yards, he's on pace for less than 1,000.

And now there's a new problem.

Barkley has been limited this week in practice with a groin injury, the second time this season he has shown up on the injury report with the injury.

Even if Barkley plays as expected against the Bears on Nov. 28, will the injury affect him? Will the Eagles have to adjust their game plan? Could Tank Bigsby, who's averaging 9.1 yards per carry this season in limited opportunities (18 carries for 164 yards) have a bigger role?

And, most importantly, what's wrong with Barkley?

Eagles coach Nick Sirianni says nothing is wrong.

""I see explosiveness. I see power. I see all the things that have made him a great football player in the NFL,"" Sirianni said. ""Sometimes it's not happening in the run game. But you see that explosiveness also in the pass game ... We just have to find ways to get him the ball, and get him in space, and that'll be our focus.""

There are many factors that go into the success of the running game. Sure, Barkley has a lot to do with it. But so does the offensive line.

And the Eagles are struggling here, too. Right tackle Lane Johnson is missing his second game with a foot injury. Center Cam Jurgens has missed two games and parts of two others with a knee injury then a concussion. Left guard Landon Dickerson has dealt with injuries throughout the season while coming off knee surgery in August.

""I think it’s on all of us,"" Jurgens said. ""We can definitely play better as an offense as a whole. I’m not going to put anything on (Barkley). We gotta do better and open up bigger holes for him ... I’m not going to focus on how many yards he has, or what our stats are, or whatever. I’m just worried about how I can be better, and there’s room for me to improve, for sure.""

It certainly doesn't help that teams are focused on stopping Barkley first, then forcing the Eagles to beat them with the passing game. The Cowboys, for example, stayed with a five-man defensive front, designed to stop the run, even as the Eagles took their 21-0 lead by passing the ball.

Of course, the Eagles have Jalen Hurts at quarterback and top receivers in A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith, along with tight end Dallas Goedert to make teams pay for focusing on the run. Smith, by the way, hasn't practiced this week because of chest and shoulder injuries along with an illness. It's not known if he'll play against the Bears.

Clearly, many of the Eagles' problems will be solved if the running game can work.

""We're trying pretty much anything and everything we can to find ways to get (Barkley) going,"" offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo said. ""I know that the guys are excited for something new this week to see if we can get it going.""

And that takes us back to the Eagles' identity. As in, what is it? And does it matter?

Celebrate the Eagles' Super Bowl win with our new book

""It's important to go into a game, find a flow, have an identity,"" Hurts said. ""But from a bigger point of view, nothing takes precedence over finding ways to win. And so that’s the most important thing ... settling on an identity, commit to it, and then we fine-tune those things knowing that there’s going to be some ups, there’s going to be some downs.

""But we’re all confident in what we’re doing, and we’re all confident in the direction that we’re going in.""

Then Hurts was asked what should that identity be?

""The identity needs to be something everybody is in alignment with,"" Hurts said. ""So it’s not a matter of how it looks. I don’t care how it looks. I don’t care who does it. I’d just like for it to get done.

""I remember getting a question about the pass game taking a step (forward) after a loss. But it’s like, who cares? We didn’t win. So nothing takes precedent over finding ways to win. That’s what really matters.""","https://www.delawareonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/17/PWIL/87313893007-2247071307.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-28 08:04:18.208706

Dart missed the past two games with a concussion suffered Nov. 9 against the Chicago Bears. Jameis Winston started in his place.

Dart, a first-round pick earlier this year, has started seven games. He's thrown 10 touchdown passes and rushed for seven more.

The rookie returns after practicing in full for the first time Wednesday. He was a limited participant in practice last week.

A source told ESPN that Dart was disappointed he was unable to play this past Sunday in Detroit. He took reps early in the week as if he would be available, but ultimately wasn't cleared.

Dart, who has been checked for a concussion in four of his last eight games dating back to the preseason, was the first quarterback up at practice Wednesday. That seemed to indicate he was in line to return.

""Yeah, we had the same plan that we had last week,"" interim coach Mike Kafka said Wednesday. ""We'll kind of carry that into this week and then just really see what ends up happening throughout the process with Jaxson being in the protocol.""

They reviewed the good news on Thursday after Dart met with an independent neurologist. It's the final step of the protocol.

Dart's style of play has been a topic of conversation surrounding the Giants. The team didn't want to take away his aggressiveness.

Brian Daboll was fired the day after Dart suffered the concussion. Kafka has been the playcaller throughout the season.

Several teammates told ESPN in recent weeks they have been imploring Dart to slide more and get out of bounds, when possible, near the sideline. They know he can't keep taking the same type of hits.

Dart is taking close to 10 hits per game.

""The best ability is availability,"" Winston said recently.

The Giants (2-10) enter Monday night on a six-game skid. They are currently in the midst of a franchise-record 12-game losing streak on the road.

New York has a bye next week. The Giants were hopeful entering this week that Dart would be able to return for the prime-time contest.

""Well, we're still having the same conversations that we would have any given week,"" Winston said Wednesday. ""I think he's locked into that point. I mean, last week, man, he was determined to play. It's just the NFL has a strict protocol and that's what happened. I was grateful, but at the same time, I felt for him because I know how much work he puts in, and I know how he prepares, and I just told him I had his back. But we're not doing anything different. We're still having the same conversations. He's still putting in his work and hopefully this week he'll be able to bounce back and help lead us to a win.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1020%2Fr1563053_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 08:04:21.061562

St. Brown was ruled out after halftime, and according to coach Dan Campbell, he will miss some time.

Campbell said in his postgame press conference that, while St. Brown may have avoided a lengthy absence, team doctors expect the standout pass catcher to be sidelined for multiple weeks.

""I'll know more tomorrow,"" Campbell said. ""I don't feel like this is long-long-term. That's the good news, but it could be a week or two, maybe, if we're lucky.""

On the game's second drive, St. Brown was rolled up from behind while blocking on a run play. He remained on the turf for a few minutes while he was evaluated by trainers. Eventually, St. Brown got up and walked off the field, straight to the locker room. He was initially listed as questionable to return, only to be officially ruled out in the third quarter.

In 11 games this season, St. Brown has caught 75 passes for 884 yards and nine touchdowns. The Lions on Sunday were already playing without tight end Sam LaPorta, who was placed on injured reserve earlier this month with a back injury, and wide receiver Kalif Raymond, who was inactive with an ankle injury.

Dan Campbell will call upon Jameson Williams, Tom Kennedy, plus rookies Isaac TeSlaa and Dominic Lovett, to potentially step up in St. Brown's absence.

With St. Brown out of the lineup, the Lions have some work to do if they're going to climb the NFC North standings down the stretch.

St. Brown's availability will be a major topic for the week between the games, as the Lions' offense isn't the same without their crafty slot receiver.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/27/PDTF/87498454007-112725-lions-1-h-031.jpg?crop=3169,1784,x0,y164&width=3169&height=1784&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-28 08:05:15.723701

,,2025-11-28 09:32:11+00:00,CBS Sports,"Colts QB Daniel Jones dealing with fractured fibula, per report - CBS Sports",Bryan DeArdo,,,,,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/daniel-jones-injury-colts-qb-fractured-fibula/,"With his team battling for a playoff spot, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones will try to play through a fibula injury that limited his practice participation over the past two weeks.
Jones was a surprise addition to the Colts' injury report when the team returned from their Week 11 bye.
Jones initially appeared on the Colts' Week 12 injury report with a calf injury.
Despite the injury, Jones played in the Colts' Week 12 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.
In his first season with the Colts, Jones is completing a career-high 69.1% of his passes.","With his team battling for a playoff spot, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones will try to play through a fibula injury that limited his practice participation over the past two weeks. Jones is dealing with a fractured fibula, NFL Media reports. Jones was a surprise addition to the Colts' injury report when the team returned from their Week 11 bye.

Jones initially appeared on the Colts' Week 12 injury report with a calf injury. Prior to the Colts' game against the Chiefs, CBS Sports' Tracy Wolfson reported that Jones in fact was dealing with a fibula injury while adding that he was not in jeopardy of missing that game.

Despite the injury, Jones played in the Colts' Week 12 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. He went 19 of 31 for 181 yards and two touchdowns in the Colts' 23-20 overtime loss. The Chiefs failed to sack Jones, but he ran the ball just three times for 16 yards.

""It was just something that was hanging over, realized it last week,"" said Jones, who was a full participant in practice. ""Just trying to get treatment and make sure I'm in the best spot that I can be.""

Jones also made it clear that he has every intention of playing in the Colts' upcoming home game against the Houston Texans.

""I'll be ready to go on Sunday,"" he said. ""Obviously, (I) was out there last week. I'm good to go.""

Jones' health is clearly a cause for concern for the Colts, who, at 8-3, are just one game ahead of the Jacksonville Jaguars and are two up on the Texans in the AFC South standings. Jones, 28, in the midst of the best season of his career.

In his first season with the Colts, Jones is completing a career-high 69.1% of his passes. He is also on pace to set new single-season career-highs in passing yards and touchdown passes.

While his success so far has made him a somewhat early candidate for NFL Comeback Player of the Year, Jones is remained focused on winning games while helping the Colts snap their four-year playoff drought.

""We've got to keep winning games,"" he said in a recent interview with CBS Sports. ""We've got to keep keep taking care of business week after week. It's been a good start to this point ... but there's certainly things we haven't done as well at times that we need to clean up and be sharper with going forward, so that will be a focus of ours.

""But yeah, we're confident. I think we're confident in our team and our ability to go a long way and to continue to play good football, but we've got to win week after week.""",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/11/27/97bfd6ff-a033-42d3-858c-4a2cc28e40ee/thumbnail/1200x675/611b506e959464f1ed8d0682eb78430e/joneskc.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 08:05:26.164414

**UPDATED AS OF TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 25TH AT 5 PM ET**

🏈 AFC East

◆ Buffalo Bills

Dalton Kincaid - TE (hamstring)

Kincaid emerged from the team’s Week 10 loss to the Dolphins with a hamstring injury. He remains sidelined and did not play in Week 12 against the Texans.

Fantasy Impact: Fox Sports’ Jordan Schultz reports Kincaid is labeled as “week-to-week.” Fellow tight end Dawson Knox played 77% of the team’s offensive snaps in each game Kincaid has missed this season but did not see more than three targets in either game. Fantasy managers probably are best looking elsewhere for help through byes this week.

◆ Miami Dolphins

Darren Waller - TE (pectoral)

Head coach Mike McDaniel said the team would open Waller’s 21-day practice window this week.

Fantasy Impact: Waller appears primed to return from a four-game absence due to a pectoral injury, and would likely return to a semi-featured role considering the state of the Dolphins. The time is now to take a shot on Waller off of waivers if his previous manager released him too soon.

Tyreek Hill - WR (knee)

Hill suffered a dislocated knee in the team’s Week 4 win over the Jets. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Hill’s absence likely places additional emphasis on the short-to-intermediate areas of the field, increasing the expected target volume for De’Von Achane, Darren Waller, and Jaylen Waddle. Malik Washington is likely to step into a secondary role and could see his aDOT improve, making him a sneaky potential FLEX option for the remainder of the season. Waddle sees the biggest boost to his fantasy value once he returns from his Week 12 bye.

◆ New England Patriots

The Patriots are now at full health following multiple injuries earlier this season.

◆ New York Jets

Garrett Wilson - WR (knee)

Wilson sprained his knee in his return to the active roster in Week 10 and is set to miss “three-to-four weeks.” He was placed on injured reserve and is eligible to return in Week 15.

Fantasy Impact: Whelp, Wilson’s return didn’t last long as he is now set to miss another chunk of time with an additional knee injury. The Jets again find themselves bereft of pass-catching talent. Rookie tight end Mason Taylor stands to benefit the most in a fantasy setting, although the Jets continue to be allergic to throwing the football. Head coach Aaron Glenn said last week that he expects Wilson to “return this season.”

Braelon Allen - RB (knee)

Allen suffered a “pretty serious” knee injury on a kickoff return in the second quarter of the team’s Week 4 loss to the Dolphins. He is out indefinitely.

Fantasy Impact: Allen has been a significant contributor in the red zone this season. His absence substantially boosts Breece Hall‘s upside, who is now a locked-in RB1 in Week 5 against the Cowboys. Backup running back Isaiah Davis can be stashed in 12-team leagues as a high-upside contingency option. Hall gained a season-high 155 yards from scrimmage on 18 opportunities in his first game without Allen in Week 5.

Josh Reynolds - WR (hip)

Reynolds was evidently placed on injured reserve in Week 10, after suffering a hip injury during practice in Week 8.

Fantasy Impact: Reynolds’ absence clears the way for new Jets wide receiver Adonai Mitchell to be active on game day.

🏈 AFC North

◆ Baltimore Ravens

Lamar Jackson - QB (toe)

Jackson has dealt with numerous injuries during the previous four weeks, with his most recent being listed as a toe issue. He was listed as a “DNP” on Monday’s estimated practice report before practicing in full Tuesday.

Fantasy Impact: Jackson appears ready to rock on Thanksgiving against the Bengals, where he will be a top tier QB1.

Rashod Bateman - WR (ankle)

Bateman returned to a limited session to begin the week and appears primed to return from a two-game absence.

Fantasy Impact: Bateman should return to a low-volume, hefty red zone role against the Bengals, leaving his range of outcomes wide.

◆ Cincinnati Bengals

Joe Burrow - QB (toe)

Burrow is set to return from a nine-game absence in Week 13 after practicing in full this week.

Fantasy Impact: Burrow returns to a team fighting for their playoff lives, raising his weekly ceiling in the process. He is a locked-in QB1 against the Ravens.

Samaje Perine - RB (ankle)

Perine practiced in full Tuesday as he attempts to return from a two-game absence.

Fantasy Impact: Perine should immediately reclaim primary change of pace duties for the Bengals, limiting the volume potential of starter Chase Brown.

◆ Cleveland Browns

Dillon Gabriel - QB (concussion)

Gabriel cleared concussion protocol Tuesday.

Fantasy Impact: Head coach Kevin Stefanksi named fellow rookie Shedeur Sanders the starter for the Browns moving forward.

◆ Pittsburgh Steelers

Aaron Rodgers - QB (wrist)

Head coach Mike Tomlin said he has “great optimism” regarding Rodgers’ chances of playing in Week 13.

Fantasy Impact: A wrist injury held Rodgers out in Week 12 but he appears to be in line to start in a must-win game against the Bills. Treat Rodgers as a low-end QB2.

🏈 AFC South

◆ Houston Texans

C.J. Stroud - QB (concussion)

The expectation is that Stroud will return in Week 13 to face the Colts.

Fantasy Impact: Backup Davis Mills won three consecutive games for the Texans, keeping them on the fringe of the playoff picture in the AFC. It’ll be up to Stroud to continue that momentum after flailing through the bulk of the season prior to his injury. Treat Stroud as a mid-range QB2 against the Colts.

Joe Mixon - RB (foot)

Mixon was placed on the Non-Football Injury list ahead of Week 1.

Fantasy Impact: Veteran Nick Chubb is now in a game script-dependent rushing role, while rookie running back Woody Marks operates as the starter.

◆ Indianapolis Colts

Anthony Richardson - QB (eye)

Richardson suffered a “freak accident” ahead of Week 6 in which an elastic band snapped a piece of metal hit him in the eye, fracturing his orbital bone. He was placed on injured reserve.

Fantasy Impact: Richardson has been off the fantasy radar all season with Daniel Jones’ career reemergence. Backup quarterback Riley Leonard can be stashed in superflex leagues, if need be.

◆ Jacksonville Jaguars

Brian Thomas Jr. - WR (ankle)

Thomas has not played since suffering a high-ankle sprain in Week 9. He was a limited participant in Week 12’s Wednesday practice but ruled out Friday.

Fantasy Impact: Thomas has already dealt with wrist and shoulder injuries in an extremely disappointing season this year. Newcomer Jakobi Meyers could continue to see his role in the offense grow as the Jaguars struggle to maintain a playoff spot in the AFC.

Travis Hunter - WR/CB (knee)

Hunter was placed on injured reserve with a season-ending LCL tear.

Fantasy Impact: See Thomas’ section above.

◆ Tennessee Titans

Calvin Ridley - WR (hamstring)

Ridley reportedly broke his fibula in Week 11 and is out for the season.

Fantasy Impact: It’s a disappointing end to a disappointing season for the veteran receiver. The Titans are left with no standout fantasy options in his absence.

Elic Ayomanor - WR (hamstring)

Ayomanor did not practice on Wednesday and was ruled out for the team’s Week 12 contest Friday.

Fantasy Impact: Chimere Dike suddenly finds himself atop the pass-catching depth chart and is FLEX-worthy in Week 12. The team elevated Xavier Restrepo from the practice squad, who played with quarterback Cam Ward in college.

🏈 AFC West

◆ Denver Broncos

J.K. Dobbins - RB (foot)

Dobbins was ruled out on Friday before being placed on IR on Saturday. The injury requires surgery, which would end his season.

Fantasy Impact: Rookie RJ Harvey would be in line to see a noticeable increase to what has been a modest snap rate, although Tyler Badie remained frustratingly involved. Jaleel McLaughlin also saw increased opportunities on early downs.

◆ Kansas City Chiefs

Isiah Pacheco - RB (knee)

Pacheco is expected to make his return in Week 13 following three missed games due to a knee injury.

Fantasy Impact: Pacheco returns to a low-upside, early-down role for the most pass-heavy offense in the league. He is nothing more than an RB3 in fantasy circles.

Rashee Rice - WR (hamstring)

Rice emerged from the team’s Week 12 win over the Colts with a hamstring injury. He is currently expected to practice on Tuesday.

Fantasy Impact: Rice remains a fantasy WR1 if active in Week 13, drawing a solid matchup with the Cowboys.

◆ Las Vegas Raiders

The Raiders escaped their loss to the Browns absent any meaningful fantasy injuries.

◆ Los Angeles Chargers

Omarion Hampton - RB (ankle)

The Chargers designated Hampton to return from injured reserve Tuesday.

Fantasy Impact: Running back Kimani Vidal‘s run as the primary runner appears ready to come to an end in Los Angeles, though it could take Hampton a couple weeks to see a full allotment of snaps.

Najee Harris - RB (Achilles)

Harris ruptured the Achilles tendon in his left leg during the Chargers’ Week 3 win over the Broncos. His season is done.

Fantasy Impact: See above.

🏈 NFC East

◆ Dallas Cowboys

George Pickens - WR (knee, calf)

Pickens was listed as a “DNP” on Monday’s estimated injury report but the expectation is that he will practice Tuesday.

Fantasy Impact: Pickens should be ready to go on Thanksgiving against the Chiefs. Continue treating him as a WR1 in a difficult matchup on paper.

Miles Sanders - RB (ankle/knee)

Sanders was injured in Week 4 and did not play in Week 5. He was ruled out for Week 6 before being placed on injured reserve, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Veteran Javonte Williams continues to operate in a near workhorse role.

◆ New York Giants

Jaxson Dart - QB (concussion)

Dart departed the team’s Week 10 loss to the Bears with a concussion. He is expected to return in Week 13 to face the Patriots.

Fantasy Impact: Dart returns as a low end QB1 against the Patriots.

Malik Nabers - WR (knee)

Nabers suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 4 win over the Chargers and will miss the remainder of the 2025 season.

Fantasy Impact: The injury could not have come at a worse time for the Giants after they moved to rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart under center. Nabers’ absence will make it difficult to consistently move the football, lowering the upside of all remaining healthy players. Nabers makes for a solid trade target for dynasty managers looking to rebuild this season.

Cam Skattebo - RB (ankle)

Skattebo suffered a gruesome dislocated ankle in the team’s Week 8 loss to the Eagles, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: The backfield in New York should revert to a timeshare headed by veteran Tyrone Tracy in Skattebo’s absence. Devin Singletary remains on hand for change-of-pace duties. Treat Tracy as a low-end RB2 for the remainder of the season.

◆ Philadelphia Eagles

The Eagles are healthy coming out of their Week 12 loss to the Cowboys.

◆ Washington Commanders

Jayden Daniels - QB (elbow)

Daniels dislocated the elbow in his left, non-throwing arm in the team’s Week 9 loss to the Seahawks. He is reportedly unlikely to play in Week 13 against the Broncos.

Fantasy Impact: Marcus Mariota will start for the Commanders for the foreseeable future, slightly denting the fantasy upside of all primary skill position players in the process. Fantasy managers in a bind could do worse than taking a flier on Mariota, considering his rushing upside.

Terry McLaurin - WR (quad)

McLaurin was reportedly back at practice Monday, although it was simply a walkthrough. Even so, his return to the practice field is a good sign for his potential availability in Week 13 against the Broncos.

Fantasy Impact: McLaurin would be a risk-reward FLEX in a difficult matchup against the Broncos, should he return in Week 13.

Noah Brown - WR (groin, knee)

Brown was placed on injured reserve in Week 7. He was designated to return on Monday.

Fantasy Impact: It has been nine weeks since both McLaurin and Brown were on the field together, although the team is likely to be without quarterback Jayden Daniels in Week 13. Brown is nothing more than a desperation FLEX, should he return against the Broncos.

🏈 NFC North

◆ Chicago Bears

The Bears now find themselves healthy after struggling through numerous injuries earlier in the season.

◆ Detroit Lions

Sam LaPorta - TE (back)

LaPorta was added to the Lions’ injury report with a back injury on Wednesday. After being ruled out for Week 11 on Friday, the Lions placed him on injured reserve on Saturday.

Fantasy Impact: The Lions’ pass-catching corps is deep. Removing LaPorta from it could result in one or more extra targets for WR Amon-Ra St. Brown, WR Jameson Williams and RB Jahmyr Gibbs.

Brock Wright - TE (neck)

Wright landed hard on his neck last week and was listed as a “DNP” on the team’s estimated practice report Monday.

Fantasy Impact: A potential absence by Wright on a short week could condense the Lions’ target dispersal even further in the absence of LaPorta. Wide receiver Kalif Raymond was also listed as a non-participant Monday, potentially paving the way for rookie Isaac TeSlaa to see increased run on Thanksgiving as a tertiary option through the air.

◆ Green Bay Packers

Josh Jacobs - RB (knee)

Jacobs departed the team’s Week 11 win with a knee injury. Initial reports indicated the knee to be “structurally sound,” while head coach Matt LaFleur followed it up by saying the veteran back is dealing with a knee contusion. He was listed as “limited” on Monday’s estimated practice report after sitting out in Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: Jacobs appears primed to return from his one-game absence and should immediately regain primary duties for the Packers. He is an RB2 against the Lions.

Jayden Reed - WR (collarbone/foot)

Reed fractured his collarbone in the Packers’ Week 2 game against the Commanders and was already playing through a Jones fracture in his foot. When news of the expected collarbone surgery broke, the Packers were reportedly hoping to get Reed back in November. Reed then revealed that he underwent surgery to correct his Jones fracture as well. It is unknown whether this will extend his recovery timeline. As of Week 12, he appears close to returning.

Fantasy Impact: Reed was limited in practice Monday but is not expected to make his return to the active roster on a short week.

Tucker Kraft - TE (knee)

Kraft suffered a season-ending torn ACL in the team’s Week 9 loss to the Panthers.

Fantasy Impact: Kraft’s breakout season comes to an end prematurely after the untimely knee injury. Luke Musgrave should be rostered in all formats as he likely enters a featured role for the Packers.

◆ Minnesota Vikings

J.J. McCarthy - QB (concussion)

McCarthy was placed in the concussion protocol Monday.

Fantasy Impact: McCarthy reported symptoms on the plane ride home from Green Bay and appears headed for an absence in Week 13. That could leave the team with only Max Brosmer at quarterback, denting the ranges of outcomes of all primary skill position players against the Seahawks.

Carson Wentz - QB (shoulder)

Wentz will undergo season-ending surgery after playing through a dislocated shoulder and torn labrum.

Fantasy Impact: Second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy is the starter in Minnesota moving forward.

🏈 NFC South

◆ Atlanta Falcons

Drake London - WR (illness)

London reportedly suffered a PCL sprain in the team’s Week 11 loss to the Panthers. Falcons head coach Raheem Morris “hopes” London can play in Week 13. He was ruled out for Week 12 Friday.

Fantasy Impact: We could see the veteran alpha miss multiple games for the Falcons, which, when combined with the absence of Michael Penix, could thrust tight end Kyle Pitts into a featured role, considering the struggles of Darnell Mooney thus far.

Michael Penix - QB (knee)

Penix reportedly suffered a knee injury that included a partially torn ACL, a separate sprain and a bone bruise in the team’s Week 11 loss to the Panthers. He will undergo season-ending ACL reconstruction.

Fantasy Impact: That leaves the team in the hands of veteran Kirk Cousins moving forward. Cousins notably completed 21-of-31 passes for only 173 yards with no touchdowns in his only other start this season, which came against an underperforming Dolphins team. The Falcons could be in some trouble the rest of the way.

◆ Carolina Panthers

The Panthers are healthy following a Week 12 loss to the 49ers.

◆ New Orleans Saints

Alvin Kamara - RB (knee)

Kamara reportedly suffered an MCL sprain in the team’s Week 12 loss to the Falcons.

Fantasy Impact: Kamara has been on the team’s injury report for most of the season, this time likely to miss multiple games. Rookie Devin Neal appears to be in line for lead rusher duties in his absence. Treat Neal as an RB2 in the coming weeks.

Kendre Miller - RB (ACL)

Miller suffered a torn ACL in the team’s Week 7 loss to the Bears. His season is over.

Fantasy Impact: Rookie Devin Neal should step into the primary change-of-pace role for the Saints in Miller’s absence. Lead back Alvin Kamara saw the highest snap rate since Week 2 following Miller’s departure and could be again looking at a workhorse role moving forward.

◆ Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Baker Mayfield - QB (shoulder)

Mayfield injured his non-throwing shoulder in the team’s Week 12 loss to the Rams. He reportedly avoided significant damage but appears likely to miss Week 13.

Fantasy Impact: It’s terrible timing for a team that has lost three straight, likely leaving Teddy Bridgewater to start under center against the Cardinals. It’s a significant downgrade to all primary skill position players.

Bucky Irving - RB (foot/shoulder)

Irving is considered week-to-week after injuring his foot in Week 4. He returned to practice in Week 11, yet is said to be in “rehab mode.” He was seen practicing early in Week 12 but was ruled out for Week 12 Friday.

Fantasy Impact: Irving appears set to return in Week 13 against the Cardinals after head coach Todd Bowles said the second-year back would practice all week. He could take some time to return to the same lead role he left when injured considering the exploits of Sean Tucker in his absence.

Mike Evans - WR (collarbone, concussion)

Evans suffered a broken collarbone in the team’s Week 7 loss to the Lions. He is expected to miss “most of the season.”

Fantasy Impact: Evans managed to play just under two quarters before the injury after returning from three missed contests due to a hamstring injury. Considering the current state of the roster, rookie Emeka Egbuka is looking like a true league-winner.

Jalen McMillan - WR (neck)

McMillan remains on injured reserve with a neck injury suffered in the preseason.

Fantasy Impact: The Buccaneers are reeling at wide receiver with McMillan, Chris Godwin and Mike Evans out.

🏈 NFC West

◆ Arizona Cardinals

Marvin Harrison Jr. - WR (appendicitis)

Harrison was ruled out for Week 11 after undergoing an emergency appendectomy on Wednesday. The team also ruled him out early in Week 12. Head coach Jonathan Gannon did not have an update to start Week 13 preparations.

Fantasy Impact: Harrison’s emergency operation leaves wide receiver Michael Wilson as the only healthy starter. Tight end Trey McBride is in line to see all the volume he can handle, while veteran slot man Greg Dortch is flirting with FLEX status after averaging over 13 fantasy points per game in games where he has seen more than 66% of the team’s offensive snaps while with the Cardinals.

Emari Demercado - RB (ankle)

Demercado suffered a high-ankle sprain in Week 11 and has already been ruled out for Week 12.

Fantasy Impact: We expect Bam Knight (ankle) to be the starter until Trey Benson is ready to return from injured reserve.

Trey Benson - RB (knee)

Benson underwent surgery after injuring his meniscus in Week 4. The Cardinals opened his 21-day practice window in Week 12. He was limited on Wednesday before being ruled out for Week 12 on Friday.

Fantasy Impact: Add Benson if he is available. He should quickly work his way toward handling an RB2-level workload when active. The Cardinals enter Week 12 with Bam Knight and Michael Carter atop their depth chart in an unfavorable matchup against the pass-funnel Jaguars.

Kyler Murray - QB (foot)

Murray injured his foot on a fourth-quarter fumble in Week 5. He was placed on injured reserve in Week 10 and will be eligible to return in Week 14 against the Rams, though it could be as the Cardinals’ backup.

Fantasy Impact: Quarterback Jacoby Brissett has finished as a QB1 in his last three games. He remains a viable streamer.

James Conner - RB (ankle)

Conner suffered a season-ending foot injury in Week 3.

Fantasy Impact: See: Trey Benson.

Zay Jones - WR (Achilles)

Jones suffered a torn Achilles in the team’s Week 10 loss to the Seahawks, ending his season.

Fantasy Impact: Jones filled a situational role for the Cardinals but his absence could provide additional run for veteran slot man Greg Dortch.

◆ Los Angeles Rams

Tyler Higbee - TE (ankle)

Higbee was placed on injured reserve after suffering an ankle injury in the team’s Week 11 win over the Seahawks.

Fantasy Impact: Higbee’s absence for much of the game against the Seahawks simply allowed rookie Terrance Ferguson to step into additional snaps as opposed to forcing the team to move away from their league-leading 13-personnel rates. Colby Parkinson should be viewed as the team’s de facto starter.

Tutu Atwell - WR (hamstring)

The Rams placed Atwell on injured reserve Monday. Head coach Sean McVay said he “hopes Atwell is ready to roll in week 13.”

Fantasy Impact: Atwell’s potential return should lessen the team’s reliance on rookie Konata Mumpfield.

◆ San Francisco 49ers

Brandon Aiyuk - WR (knee)

Head coach Kyle Shanahan said the team would not open Aiyuk’s 21-day practice window ahead of a Week 11 meeting with the Cardinals. The same was said for Week 12. Reports then surfaced that Aiyuk and the 49ers are “headed for divorce” after the team voided his 2025 guarantees.

Fantasy Impact: A mostly lost season for Aiyuk appears to be quickly approaching, at least as far as fantasy is concerned.

◆ Seattle Seahawks

Tory Horton - WR (groin, shin)

Horton was added to the injury report Thursday with multiple ailments and did not play in Week 10 against the Cardinals. He was ruled out for Week 11 on Friday and remains sidelined early in Week 12. He was ruled out for Week 12 Friday.",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/346f9d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3406x1916+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff8%2F26%2Fd035002740e9b73885d2ff63dac1%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D27667761,N,,2025-11-26 08:00:12.562838

2025 NFL Thanksgiving schedule: Cowboys host Chiefs to headline huge holiday triple-header

Jared Dubin

Green Bay Packers at Detroit Lions (-2.5)

Karl Brooks, Lukas Van Ness and Savion Williams were all DNPs for the second consecutive day on Tuesday. Javon Bullard, Edgerrin Cooper, Matthew Golden, Nate Hobbs, Josh Jacobs, Jayden Reed, Zach Tom, Quay Walker and Dontayvion Wicks were limited for the second straight day. Keisean Nixon got in a limited practice after not practicing at all on Monday, a good sign for his potential availability.

None of Graham Glasgow, Kerby Joseph, Kalif Raymond or Brock Wright practiced for the second consecutive day. It seems unlikely they'll play. (Dan Campbell all but confirmed that Joseph, at least, will sit.) The Lions had Terrion Arnold, Taylor Decker, Tate Ratledge, Penei Sewell and Isaac TeSlaa all limited for the second straight day on Tuesday, but Brian Branch upgraded to a full practice. Campbell expressed optimism that Marcus Davenport could return on Thursday.

Kansas City Chiefs at Dallas Cowboys (+3)

Running back Isiah Pacheco is set to make his return for Kansas City and has been a full participant so far this week. He's missed each of the last three games with a knee injury. Noah Gray has a concussion and did not practice Monday or Tuesday. Neither did Trey Smith, who is dealing with an ankle injury. Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy and Leo Chenal were upgraded to full practices on Tuesday.

George Pickens returned to a limited practice on Tuesday after sitting out with knee and calf designations on Monday. KaVontae Turpin and Osa Odighizuwa were similarly limited after being DNPs for the first session of the week. Left tackle Tyler Guyton has been a DNP on both days and was spotted by CBS Sports' Garrett Podell in a walking boot.

Cincinnati Bengals at Baltimore Ravens (-7)

Quarterback Joe Burrow is set to make his long-awaited return for Cincinnati after nearly making the start last weekend against the Patriots. He's been out since Week 3 after having toe surgery.

Safety Reed Blankenship said he got kneed in the hamstring while making a tackle in the third quarter of Sunday's game in Dallas, which caused him to exit the game. Blankenship tried to build up the confidence to be able to run despite the injury, but didn't want to be a burden to the rest of the defense.

Blankenship said on Tuesday that the injury is a ""little sore, but it's part of (football)."" He would have been a limited participant if the Eagles practiced on Tuesday. The team held a walkthrough.

While Blankenship is on track to return for the Black Friday matchup against the Chicago Bears as Defensive Coordinator Vic Fangio said he expects Blankenship to play, the safety will have a different tag-team partner in Sydney Brown after rookie Andrew Mukuba suffered an ankle injury on the final drive of the game. Brown entered the game after Blankenship went down.

""I'm just owning my role and doing what I need to do to be successful,"" Brown said. ""It's going to be amazing. It's what I came here to do. I'm just embracing the opportunity for what it is. I feel horrible for Drew. He's been having a great season so far. Doing a really good job in the secondary as a safety. I hate to see that as a young player. I can relate to him because I went through it. I know what he's going through is a tough process, but he's going to get through it and he's going to be back.""

Mukuba would not have practiced on Tuesday and Head Coach Nick Sirianni said on Monday that the rookie will ""be out for some time.""

Safety isn't the only position worth monitoring in the secondary.

Cornerback Adoree' Jackson would have been a full participant on Tuesday, but he's under the gameday concussion protocol evaluation. If Jackson is not cleared ahead of the Black Friday game, the Eagles have several options at their disposal. After the injury occurred on Sunday, Cooper DeJean was moved from the nickel to outside cornerback and Michael Carter II played in the slot.

Carter played his most extensive reps on defense (25) since being acquired just before the trade deadline from the Jets.

""He's very, very smart. He can play any position,"" Blankenship said of Carter. ""In the meeting room, he's asking high-level questions and that's what you want. He's only been here for a couple of weeks and it feels like he's been here for a long time just based off what he's asking and what he's doing on the practice field. If he has to play a lot, we're very confident in that.""

Four other Eagles, in addition to Mukuba, would not have practiced on Tuesday: punt returner Xavier Gipson (shoulder), defensive end Brandon Graham (groin), tackle Lane Johnson (foot), and wide receiver DeVonta Smith (shoulder/chest).

DBs Kyler Gordon, Jaylon Johnson inch closer to return

The Chicago Bears lead the NFL with 24 takeaways this season. And now, they might get two of their top defensive backs on the field for the eagerly anticipated Black Friday showdown with the Eagles.

Nickel cornerback Kyler Gordon and outside cornerback Jaylon Johnson are designated to return from Injured Reserve. They weren't activated for Sunday's win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, but would have been full participants in practice on Tuesday. The Bears held a walkthrough, so Tuesday's injury report is an estimation.

Gordon has played in just two games this season, limited by a hamstring injury earlier in the year and now a calf injury. He hasn't played since the Bears' Week 7 win over the Saints. Former Eagle C.J. Gardner-Johnson was signed to play the nickel position in Gordon's absence.

Johnson, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, has played in only one game thus far this year due to multiple groin injuries. Johnson's return comes at an opportune time as cornerback Tyrique Stevenson would not have practiced on Tuesday due to a hip injury. Nashone Wright has started in place of Johnson, while Nick McCloud came into Sunday's game after Stevenson's injury.

Another former Eagle, linebacker T.J. Edwards, has been sidelined with hand and hamstring injuries. Edwards would not have practiced on Tuesday. Edwards' replacement, Ruben Hyppolite II, exited Sunday's game with a shoulder injury and would not have practiced on Tuesday. Amen Ogbongbemiga replaced him. The Bears are already without Pro Bowl linebacker Tremaine Edmunds, who was placed on Injured Reserve before the Week 12 win over the Steelers and linebacker Noah Sewell has been sidelined with an elbow injury.

Left tackle Theo Benedet is on pace to return to the starting lineup after being inactive against the Steelers with a quad injury. Rookie Ozzy Trapilo started for Benedet. Luke Newman, who was Chicago's sixth OL in jumbo packages against Pittsburgh, did not practice due to a foot injury. He played 22 offensive snaps in the win over the Steelers.

Defensive lineman Dominque Robinson suffered a concussion in the fourth quarter of Sunday's win and is in the concussion protocol.

The only game he missed this season was the first Giants game in Week 6.","The Eagles on Tuesday released a lengthy injury report as they begin a short week before hosting the Chicago Bears on Black Friday.

Because of the short week, the Eagles held a walkthrough instead of a practice on Tuesday, so this injury report is an estimation:

Did not practice: S Drew Mukuba (ankle), RT Lane Johnson (foot), WR DeVonta Smith (shoulder/chest), DE Brandon Graham (groin), WR Xavier Gipson (shoulder)

Limited: RB Saquon Barkley (groin), S Reed Blankenship (thigh), LG Landon Dickerson (knee)

Full: CB Adoree’ Jackson (gameday concussion protocol), OT Myles Hinton (back), OL Willie Lampkin (knee/ankle)

Among the non-participants on Tuesday, the one to watch is Smith with that shoulder/chest injury. Smith has been an incredibly durable player during his NFL career but there are two fewer days to heal this week.

Barkley said after the loss in Dallas that he’s healthy but he popped back up on the injury report with a groin injury. That’s obviously something to monitor going forward as well. Barkley on Sunday had 10 carries for 22 yards.

NFL

While Jackson was evaluated for a concussion on Sunday, he did not suffer one and is not in the NFL’s concussion protocol. He was kept out of the rest of the Cowboys game for precautionary reasons but should presumably be available against the Bears on Friday.

While Blankenship (thigh) was limited to start this week, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said he expects to have Blankenship available for Friday. That’s a big deal because the Eagles will be without Mukuba, who needs surgery for an ankle fracture. Mukuba might miss the rest of his rookie season.

Graham (groin) and Gipson (shoulder) are both new injuries. Gipson was in a sling after the game.

That means all practice participation levels are estimates based on projections from coaches, had a typical practice been held.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

No practice

WR Kalif Raymond (ankle)

TE Brock Wright (neck)

C Graham Glasgow (knee)

EDGE Josh Paschal (back, still on NFI) — Downgraded on Tuesday — Days remaining in evaluation: 0

S Kerby Joseph (knee)

Following last Sunday’s game, things didn’t look good for Raymond to play this Thursday. However, Lions coach Dan Campbell isn’t ready to rule him out just yet. While the ankle is “stiff” and “swollen,” Campbell said they’d need to see how he was doing on Wednesday before making a decision.

Wright swapped out an ankle injury for a neck injury in Week 13 and has been estimated to have missed two practices, which is not ideal on a short week. If Wright can’t go, the Lions would need to turn to Ross Dwelley, who played a TE3 role all season.

Glasgow has been dealing with a knee injury for two weeks now, so it’s not out of the question that he took Monday off as a precaution. However, a second missed practice raises some concerns. The Lions will be hoping for good news on Wednesday, or they may need to turn to Trystan Colon at center.

Paschal is on the final day of his injury evaluation window, and while he’s appeared to have made steady incremental progress, an 11th-hour downgrade raises some red flags. While he’s expected to be activated to the 53-man roster very soon, this could be an indicator that he’s not ready to return, and with no more days remaining for evaluation, he may end up being shut down for the year.

Joseph hasn’t formally been ruled out for this week’s game, but Campbell noted that he doesn’t expect him to be available for Thursday’s game. This will be his sixth game missed, but Campbell believes it’s for the best in the long term.

”To Kerby’s credit, man, he is rehabbing, he’s putting in the work,” Campbell said on Tuesday. “He knows the work he’s putting in now will hopefully keep us from having to ride this wave up and down. ‘OK, he’s back, now he’s not able to go.’ That’s kind of what all this is about, is man, getting him to a point (where) we strengthen some of these; stabilize some of this, the muscles in this area, and get him to where, ‘Alright, here we go, man.’ Doesn’t mean it’s going to alleviate some of the pain, but it’s going to make him feel a lot better, and he will be more than functional. He will be able to produce and be ready for the next week.”

Limited practice

RB Sione Vaki (ankle/thumb)

RB Jacob Saylors (back/knee)

WR Isaac TeSlaa (hand)

RT Penei Sewell (ankle)

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

RG Tate Ratledge (knee)

CB Terrion Arnold (concussion)

Vaki added a thumb injury to his injury list this week, but he has been managing to play through his injuries of late and has a chance to continue that path this week.

Saylors, like Vaki, added another injury to the list this week, but he’s estimated to have been able to practice, which is a good sign for his ability to play against the Packers.

TeSlaa swapped out an oblique injury for a hand injury this week, but he’s still been estimated to have practiced, which is a good thing considering Raymond’s status is cloudy at the moment. At this time, the rookie appears in line for a WR3 role.

“He’s gotten better and better and better. And we are, we’re asking him to do more,” Campbell said of TeSlaa on Tuesday. “And so, I do believe it’s going to come. I do believe he’ll get an uptick in production; he’ll get used a little bit more here. But I like where he’s at, he’s doing a good job.”

Sewell is likely going to take things a bit slow this week, as they finally had a game without him incurring a new injury. There doesn’t appear to be any major concerns surrounding his ankle, with regard to availability this week.

Decker typically takes days off to rest his shoulder, so it’s not overly surprising to see him estimated to be taking things easy this week. A day off wouldn’t be out of the norm, even in a week of walkthroughs.

Ratledge, like Sewell, is a full week removed from his ankle injury, and he managed to play every snap last weekend, and should be on track to start on Thursday.

Arnold continues to work his way through the NFL’s concussion protocol. Campbell noted that Arnold cleared the first hurdle on Monday and can take the necessary steps to clear protocols, even without the team holding a formal practice. He still has more steps to complete, but they’re hopeful he can return.

Full practice

G Miles Frazier (knee, still on PUP) — Days remaining in evaluation: 0

EDGE Marcus Davenport (shoulder, still on IR) — Days remaining in evaluation: 7

S Brian Branch (toe/ankle) — Upgraded from limited

Frazier is in the final days of their injury evaluation window, and a decision on his status is imminent.

He’s been estimated to have practiced fully this week, and a move to the active roster is expected.

Davenport still has a week remaining in his injury evaluation window, but Campbell continues to reiterate that there’s a chance the edge rusher can return to the field this week.

“It would be big to be able to get him back,” Campbell said on Tuesday. “He’s done a lot to get back. the amount of work that he’s put in and the amount of rehab. And look, it’s not his fault things have happened. All you can do is go back to work and do everything you can to return and get your body healed up and come back better than you were. And he’s done everything that that requires. So, we’re hopeful. He walked through yesterday, he’s going to walk through again today, and we’ll see.”

While there are still hurdles to jump through, Campbell said it will come down to how Davenport “feels” this week, and if he believes he’ll be ready to go, there’s a chance we’ll see him on Thanksgiving Day.

Of note, the Lions have reportedly already informed nickelback Arthur Maulet that they will be releasing him, with the expectation being that this will open up one of the necessary spots.

Branch had a second injury added to his ailment list this week, but he’s estimated to have been able to practice through them and was upgraded to a full practice on Tuesday, which is an encouraging sign that he’s on track to play on Thanksgiving.

It may be too little too late for the Bengals, but Burrow is going to suit up if he's able.","Joe Burrow is expected to make his return to the field this Thanksgiving when his Cincinnati Bengals travel to take on Lamar Jackson and the Baltimore Ravens. Burrow suffered a Grade 3 turf toe injury back in Week 2 that required surgery, but he returned to practice two weeks ago and will return to help Cincinnati dig out of a 3-8 hole.

There are plenty of people out there questioning Burrow's decision. The franchise quarterback has a history of injuries but is returning to the field for a team that is considered a significant longshot to reach the postseason (+2500 at FanDuel). But Burrow doesn't see it that way. His job is to play football, and if he gets hurt, his job is to rehab and get back to playing football.

""I understand why people feel that way, but if you look at it from my perspective, I'm a football player and if I get hurt, I'm going to go through the rehab process and then I'm going to let everybody know when I feel like I can go out there and play,"" Burrow said, via CBS Sports' John Breech. ""I don't really know what else to say about that. I'm not ever going to go to somebody and say, 'Yeah, I'm healthy, but I don't think I should go out there and play.' That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

""I'm not going to live my life and play this game scared of something happening. Like, yeah, something is going to happen, it's football. Guys are going to get hurt, guys are going to get concussions, you're going to break bones, tear ligaments, it's a physical, intense game. That's part of this. Yeah, I've had injuries, there's not a lot I can do about that. I worked really hard to have that not happen, but what I can do is when it does happen, I can control how I'm attacking my rehab and attacking practice and doing everything in my power to get back as quickly as possible and that's what I did.""

Joe Burrow injury update: Bengals coach anticipates star QB playing on Thanksgiving vs. Ravens

Bryan DeArdo

Burrow completed 58.3% of his passes for 189 yards and two touchdowns before going down with his toe injury. It was unfortunate, as Burrow had a magnificent season in 2024, leading the NFL in both passing yards (4,918) and passing touchdowns (43) while winning Comeback Player of the Year for the second time in his career.

When Burrow went down, Jake Browning took over as the Bengals' starting quarterback. However, after a disastrous 0-3 stretch, Cincinnati was forced to consider other options. In the first week of October, the Bengals sent a fifth-round pick to the rival Cleveland Browns for Joe Flacco and a sixth-round pick. While Flacco did jump-start the offense, the fact of the matter is he's 1-5 as the starter, and the Bengals have lost four straight.

Several players went down injured during the 26-20 game, with four of them unable to finish the contest — including a pair of starters along the offensive line.

Let’s assess the damage after rewatching the game.

Patriots injury analysis: Week 12

LG Jared Wilson: The Patriots’ left guard remained down after a 3rd-and-1 conversion by TreVeyon Henderson on the third offensive snap of the day. He walked off under own power but with a noticeable limp, and after a brief stay in the blue medical tent was carted to the locker room. Originally deemed as questionable to return, he was ruled out at the half and later diagnosed with a high ankle sprain. Wilson is considered week-to-week because of the injury. | News

S Brenden Schooler: The All-Pro special teamer went down on the kickoff following Drake Maye’s pick-six in the early second quarter. Trying to sustain a block, he tripped and fell backwards, grabbing his left ankle as he went to the ground. Schooler initially remained on the sidelines and tested out his ankle, but was eventually ruled out for the remainder of the contest at the half.

RT Morgan Moses: In the early second quarter, the Patriots’ right tackle was slow to get up following a 2-yard run. Moses left for the locker room and was announced as questionable to return because of an illness, but he did manage to come back. He returned to the game later in the second quarter, having missed seven offensive snaps, and finished the contest without any clear limitations.

DT Khyiris Tonga: New England suffered another first-half loss with 8:54 to go in the second quarter. Defensive tackle Khyiris Tonga stayed down following a pass play, requiring assistance on the field. He eventually left for the sideline, where he underwent further testing, before returning to the field on the extra point after Marcus Jones’ interception return touchdown. He remained in the lineup for the next defensive drive, but took his final snap of the day with 5:12 left in the game. Tonga was listed as questionable to return with a chest injury in the third quarter, but remained on the bench after the announcement.

LT Will Campbell: Trying to block on a perimeter run, New England’s rookie left tackle was rolled up on from his right and taken down. He remained on the ground, getting immediate medical help and undergoing testing on his right knee, including an ACL check. Campbell eventually limped off the field with members of the Patriots’ staff and headed to the blue medical tent. Like teammate Jared Wilson before him, he was eventually carted to the locker room and ruled out shortly thereafter. On Monday, it was reported that Campbell had suffered a sprained MCL that is expected to keep him out multiple weeks. | News

TE Hunter Henry: The Patriots’ leading receiver on the day, Henry was slow to get up after getting gang-tackled on a 14-yard catch-and-run midway through the fourth quarter. He was back two plays later, though, and no injury was announced.

What this means for the Patriots

The biggest names on the injury list coming out of Week 12 are Will Campbell and Jared Wilson, the Patriots’ rookie pair manning the left tackle and guard spots, respectively. Both are set to miss the upcoming game against the New York Giants, and possibly time after that as well. That being said, the team is hopeful that the two of them will be able to make a comeback later in the season and potentially be available for the start of the playoffs.

With them out, the Patriots will need to rebuild the left side of their O-line. Against Cincinnati, they did so by inserted Vederian Lowe for Campbell and Ben Brown for Wilson — a group that should remain intact for the foreseeable future, even though head coach Mike Vrabel was non-committal on Monday.

The offensive line is the biggest but not the only concern heading toward Week 13. Neither Brenden Schooler nor Khyiris Tonga were able to finish Sunday’s game as well, with the former spotted in a walking boot in the locker room after the game. Tonga, on the other hand, remained on the bench and participated in postgame handshakes, which can be interpreted as a positive sign.

Vrabel was asked about both during a press conference on Monday.

“Tonga’s never going to let anybody down as long as he’s here,” he said. “These guys want to go, and I have to look at them, I’ve got to figure out if they can, if they can protect themselves, they can do their job and not make it any worse. He clearly, from what I saw, wasn’t going to be able to do most of those things. And so, we’ll just see how he progresses through the week.”

As for Schooler, Vrabel said that he had, “[n]o update there, other than we have a busy training staff this morning.”

The Patriots will return to the practice fields on Wednesday, for their lone session before the Thanksgiving break.

The Green Bay Packers' running back was forced out of the team's Week 11 contest against the New York Giants with a knee injury. At first, the news didn't seem too promising, suggesting Jacobs would miss some time going forward.

While that may or may not be the case in the immediate future, Jacobs' time on the sidelines seems to be shrinking as the days go by.

The veteran missed Week 12's contest against the Minnesota Vikings, but has been considered day-to-day, leaving his status for Thanksgiving up in the air. Green Bay is set to visit another NFC North rival, the Detroit Lions, on the holiday.

Practice reports will tell the story here, but things are getting better for Jacobs faster than expected.

Here's the latest.

When will Josh Jacobs return?

Jacobs was listed as a limited participant on Nov. 24's estimated practice report.

The Packers have a short week ahead of them, but the running back fought to play in Week 12 before being ruled out. His status wasn't determined until inactive reports were due 90 minutes prior to kickoff, meaning there should be a good chance of his participation in Week 13, barring a setback.

Head coach Matt LaFleur came across as optimistic last week, telling reporters on Nov. 19 that Jacobs was day-to-day.

""The plan is to try to get him healthy enough to go and it's just gonna be a day-by-day thing,"" LaFleur said. ""He is truly day-to-day and we'll see how he progresses as the week unfolds.""

The overall outlook remains positive for Jacobs. He has already avoided a possible season-ending injury and also won't be subjected to a stint on injured reserve.

Tests on Nov. 17 confirmed that Jacobs' knee had no structural damage, according to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport.

Jacobs is the unquestioned workhorse in Green Bay's backfield, but all hope isn't lost if he can't play in Week 13. Wilson and Brooks are capable of handling the job for the time being.

Wilson figures to handle more of the running downs, while Brooks profiles as the better receiving option for the Packers' offense.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/19/USAT/87358181007-josh-jacobs-111925.jpg?crop=6249,3515,x360,y302&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-26 08:01:12.953740

The Green Bay Packers were without top RB Josh Jacobs due to a knee injury. As a result, Emanuel Wilson stepped in as the next man up and capitalized on it for fantasy managers, scoring twice en route to 25.5 fantasy points in a win over the Vikings. We'll be monitoring Jacobs' status on the short week with the Packers facing the Lions on Thanksgiving. We'll also be looking at the overall NFL injury report with fantasy analysis for key players.

Joe Burrow, QB, Bengals (toe): We came close to seeing Burrow activated off IR in Week 12. That wasn't the case and now the expectation is Burrow will try to get on the field on Thanksgiving vs. Baltimore. It's now or never for Cincinnati and its playoff hopes. If Burrow is back, it's an upgrade for all the receivers. It will be interesting to see if Chase Brown maintains his volume of carries; he has 27 combined carries over the past two games. It seems like Burrow could be without one his key weapons.

Tee Higgins, WR, Bengals (head): Higgins went down hard on a catch attempt late in the team's loss to New England on Sunday. He wasn't able to return after suffering a concussion. Head coach Zac Taylor has already ruled Higgins out when the Bengals play on Thursday night vs. the Ravens. Ja'Marr Chase returns from suspension and should go back to heavy target volume — especially with Burrow expected back. Andrei Iosivas could see more work and is an intriguing add off the waiver wire with Higgins out. Also keep an eye on TE Mike Gesicki, who could have streaming value.

Baker Mayfield, QB, Bucs (shoulder): The Tampa Bay QB was forced from Sunday Night Football vs. the Rams in the second quarter after suffering a sprain in his non-throwing shoulder. By that point, the Bucs were getting run out of the stadium in a 34-7 loss, so there wasn't much reason for Mayfield to risk further injury trying to return. Teddy Bridgewater came in relief and didn't do much with 62 yards on 8 of 15 attempts. Mayfield is set to undergo an MRI on Monday, then we'll know more about his status for Week 13 vs. the Cardinals.

Aaron Rodgers, QB, Steelers (wrist): Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin anticipates Rodgers being ready for Week 13 vs. the Bills. Rodgers was held out of Week 12's loss to the Bears due to a fractured left wrist. It's Rodgers' non-throwing hand so the team likely wanted a bit more time for it to heal. With Rodgers potentially back, it would provide a slight boost in value for receivers DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin III. Pittsburgh should continue to lean into the run game with Jaylen Warren and Kenneth Gainwell, the two best fantasy starts on this team right now.

Josh Jacobs, RB, Packers (knee): As we mentioned above, Jacobs was out last week due to the knee injury. He had been getting limited practices in prior to Week 12 and Green Bay knew it had the short week with the Thanksgiving game vs. Detroit. There's a chance Jacobs could have played this week if it were the playoffs. With that said, the short turnaround could mean he sits another game to get extra rest. Wilson looked serviceable in relief on Sunday vs. the Vikings. He'll remain a very strong RB start in fantasy if Jacobs is out again.

Drake London, WR, Falcons (knee): This is rough for all parties. London missed Week 12 and there's a chance the Falcons play it safe with their top wideout. If that's the case, we may not see London back on the field in 2025. It would be a big blow to fantasy managers and Atlanta's offense. QB Michael Penix Jr. is done for the season and backup Kirk Cousins threw for two TDs and 199 yards and a pick vs. the Saints on Sunday. Darnell Mooney saved his fantasy day by catching a 49-yard TD to finish with a 3-74-1 line. There isn't much value in this Falcons passing game with London out and Cousins under center.

Alvin Kamara, RB, Saints (knee): Kamara exited in the first half of Sunday afternoon's matchup vs. the Falcons and did not return. He had five touches for 15 yards prior to exiting. Devin Neal stepped in and got the majority of the work in the backfield. He finished with seven carries for 18 yards while also catching five of seven targets for 43 yards. If Kamara misses any time, Neal would be the last healthy back left. Kendre Miller went down for the season back Week 7. Neal would have some flex value given his involvement in the passing game from Week 12 and the Saints likely needing to pass more as six-point underdogs against the Dolphins.

Jayden Daniels, QB, Commanders (elbow): We got a brief update on Daniels on Monday after the Commanders' bye week. He's a long-shot to play in Week 13 vs. the Broncos, but is expected to return to practice in some capacity. That feels encouraging for his prospects of making it back on the field again this season, though it doesn't exactly feel like a smart move with Washington sitting at 3-8 on the season. With Daniels expected out again, Marcus Mariota will start against one of the toughest matchups in the NFL.

J.J. McCarthy, QB, Vikings (concussion): The Minnesota signal caller was placed into the NFL's protocol for this week after showing symptoms following the loss to Green Bay in Week 12. With at least two interceptions in each of the past three games, McCarthy was trending down big time before the injury. Max Brosmer is taking first-team reps and is on track to face the Seahawks in Week 13. It can't get much worse for the Vikings offense with J.J. throwing the ball, so perhaps Brosmer could lift WRs Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison back to fantasy relevance.

Omarion Hampton, RB, Chargers (ankle): Hampton has been on injured reserve since Week 6 due to an ankle injury. His 21-day practice window for a return has been opened, so it appears the rookie back is close to getting on the field again. We'll have to see if the team eases Hampton back into the rotation, seemingly with RB Kimani Vidal, who has filled in admirably in a lead role.

""Our guys are ready to go. They don't flinch,"" Bills defensive coordinator Bobby Babich said a day after the loss. ""We rep it that way. They know that they're a play away. And everybody's held to the same standard here.""

Buffalo has 10 days to get healthy before it plays the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday, and could be facing its second straight backup quarterback.

Pittsburgh starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers did not play in Week 12 due to a broken bone in his left wrist. Steelers wide receiver DK Metcalf left Sunday's game twice with an ankle injury.

Buffalo travels to play Pittsburgh at 4:25 p.m. Sunday at Acrisure Stadium.

NFL teams have to submit a report on practice participation on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday for a Sunday game. There are three levels of practice participation that can be designated: did not participate, limited participation and full participation.

A game status report is due by 4 p.m. Friday for Sunday games.

Here is the Bills vs. Steelers injury report for Week 13:

Buffalo Bills injury report for Week 13

Dalton Kincaid, TE, hamstring

Dalton Kincaid has missed the last two games since suffering a hamstring injury in Week 10.

He hobbled off the field grabbing his right hamstring in the third quarter of Week 10 and walked to the Bills locker room with trainers. Kincaid did not return.

Kincaid, who missed Week 6 with an oblique injury, has 29 catches for 448 receiving yards and a team-high four touchdown receptions.

Terrel Bernard, LB, elbow

Terrel Bernard walked into the locker room holding his right arm in the third quarter and returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling.

The Bills' defensive captain was injured after being in on a tackle for a 1-yard loss on Houston running back Nick Chubb. Bernard lied on his stomach in pain and rolled onto his back holding his right arm as he was tended to by athletic trainers. He got to his feet and walked into the locker room with a trainer holding his right arm.

He was ruled out for the rest of the game.

Bernard is considered week-to-week, according to Bills head coach Sean McDermott.

Bernard has 56 tackles, seven tackles for loss, one interception and two fumble recoveries in 10 games in 2025.

Spencer Brown, OT, shoulder

Spencer Brown was evaluated for an injury after grabbing his right shoulder in the third quarter and was cleared to return. Brown struggled after re-entering the game and was replaced in the fourth quarter by Ryan Van Demark.

Brown was spotted with his arm in a sling in the locker room after the game.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Nov. 21 that Brown ""potentially"" could go on injured reserve.

Maxwell Hairston, CB, concussion

Maxwell Hairston is in the league's concussion protocol after suffering a concussion in Week 12.

He was injured in the third quarter when his helmet crashed into the side of Houston running back Woody Marks. Hairston did not come back into the game.

Josh Allen, QB, shoulder

Josh Allen experienced an injury scare in the loss to the Texans in Week 12.

Late in the first quarter, Allen stepped up in the pocket and cocked his arm back to throw near the line of scrimmage when he was walloped by Houston Texans defensive end Will Anderson Jr. from behind.

Allen face-planted to the ground, kicked his legs while on his stomach and then rolled onto his back still kicking his leg in pain and holding his hands together.

The quarterback walked to the sideline and took a seat on the bench. He put his helmet on, warmed up on the sideline and returned for the Bills' next series.

""We're good,"" Allen said in his postgame press conference when asked if he was injured. He said he landed on his left shoulder and it ""went a little numb on me.""

""Josh Allen is sore, but we expect him to be fine,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Nov. 21.

Christian Benford, CB, shoulder

Christian Benford walked off the field with trainers and went into the blue medical tent late in second quarter against the Texans in Week 12. He was evaluated for a shoulder injury and cleared to return for the second half.

A.J. Epenesa, DE, neck

A.J. Epenesa was evaluated for a neck injury in the second half and was cleared to return against the Texans in Week 12.

Epenesa finished with three tackles and played 24 defensive snaps and one snap on special teams.

Connor McGovern, C

Connor McGovern went down in third third quarter on a play which Josh Allen was sacked but he did not miss any time.

Curtis Samuel, WR, elbow/neck

Curtis Samuel did not play in Week 12 due to elbow/neck injuries.

Phidarian Mathis, DT, shoulder

Phidarian Mathis was inactive with a shoulder injury in Week 11 and Week 12.

Shaq Thompson, LB, hamstring

Shaq Thompson returned in Week 12 after being out three straight games after reaggravating a hamstring in practice in the week leading up to Week 9.

Thompson posted four tackles while playing 34 defensive snaps and 11 special teams snaps against the Texans.

The 11th-year linebacker initially had a nagging hamstring injury in training camp.

Buffalo Bills injured reserve

Mecole Hardman, WR, calf

Mecole Hardman was placed on injured reserve on Nov. 20 after playing one game the Bills.

He was injured in Week 11 and did not return after suffering a calf injury in the third quarter. Hardman's first touch with was a 61-yard kickoff return in the first quarter. He muffed a punt that resulted in a lost fumble the third quarter, which is when he suffered the calf injury.

Landon Jackson, DE, knee

Landon Jackson was injured on his second defensive snap against the Dolphins in Week 10.

The rookie third-round pick came off the left edge on a run by Ollie Gordon and fought off a block before falling backward. He immediately brought his right knee to his chest and grabbed it in pain and trainers evaluated him on the field.

Jackson was ruled out for the game shortly after. He returned to the Bills sideline in the second half with a brace on his right knee and using crutches.

His injury left the Bills with as many injured defensive ends (Jackson, A.J. Epenesa, Michael Hoecht) as healthy defensive ends (Joey Bosa, Greg Rousseau, Javon Solomon).

Jackson has played in three games with 30 defensive snaps and 13 special teams snaps and is yet to record his first career tackle.

Ed Oliver, DT, biceps

Ed Oliver suffered a torn biceps injury which will require surgery and is out indefinitely. He was placed on on injured reserve on Oct. 28 and is eligible to return in Week 13.

Oliver was hurt in the second quarter and was ruled out for the rest of the game against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.

Oliver, who had a sack on the first possession of the game, went into the medical tent and FOX cameras showed him speaking with trainers and pointing to his left arm. He returned to the sideline with his arm in a sling under his hooded sweatshirt.

Oliver is tied for the team lead with three sacks despite only plying in three of the Bills' seven games.

He missed four games earlier this season (Weeks 2-5) with an ankle injury after he got stepped on in practice on Sept. 10.

Taylor Rapp, S, knee

Taylor Rapp was placed on injured reserve on Oct. 24.

Bills head coach Sean McDermott said Rapp was battling an injury since training camp and ""it got to the point where he can't be himself.""

Rapp ha 26 tackles in six games this season.

Michael Hoecht, DE, Achilles

Michael Hoecht tore his right Achilles in the fourth quarter of the win against the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.

He suffered the non-contact injury while taking one step into his rush off the left edge with 14:25 remaining. Hoecht was unable to put pressure on his right leg. He waved off the cart that drove into the field to take him to the locker room. Instead, Hoecht hobbled off with the help of trainers and stayed on the bench with his teammates for the rest of the game.

Hoecht, a free agent signing in the offseason, was suspended for the first six games of the season.

He has five tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble in two games.

""It's a big loss,"" Bills head coach Sean McDermott said in his postgame press conference. “I feel terrible for him.”

Tyler Bass, K, left hip/groin

Tyler Bass was placed on injured reserve on Friday, Sept. 5 after he was unable to practice the day prior. Bass missed most of training camp with pelvic soreness, sitting out from July 28 to Aug. 19 before returning for the preseason finale. He went 3-for-4 in that game, connecting from 37, 37 and 39 yards before pushing a 26-yarder wide right.

Bass was eligible to return in Week 5 against the New England Patriots but has not had his 21-day practice window opened.

Matt Prater, 41, signed to the Bills practice squad, was elevated for Week 1 and made a 32-yard game-winning field goal with no time left to defeat the Baltimore Ravens 41-40 in Week 1. Prater has since been signed to the active roster and is 10-for-11 on field goals and 17-for-17 on extra points through six games.

Cameron Johnston, P, foot/ankle

Cameron Johnston suffered left foot and ankle injuries after taking a hit to his left plant leg on a punt in the fourth quarter in the Week 4 win over the Saints. The Bills placed him on injured reserve on Sept. 30 and signed punter Mitch Wishnowsky.

New Orleans linebacker Nephi Sewell crashed into Johnston’s left leg and was flagged for a roughing the kicker penalty. Johnston, 33, immediately slammed his helmet to the turf in frustration before hobbling off with trainers.

The athletic staff put a brace on Johnston's left leg and he stretched out his leg on the sideline. Backup quarterback Mitchell Trubisky put his helmet on in case he needed to take over holding duties on a field goal but Johnston came back into the game to hold for Matt Prater's 35-yard field goal that gave the Bills a 31-19 lead. He walked to the X-ray room after the game.

Johnston was carted off the field with a season-ending right knee injury in Week 1 last season after taking a low shot while playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Dorian Strong, CB, neck

Dorian Strong played in four games with one start before suffering a neck injury and being placed on injured reserve on Oct. 4. The rookie sixth-round pick was eligible to return in Week 10.

Damar Hamlin, S, pectoral

Damar Hamlin suffered pectoral injury in practice Oct. 9 and was placed on injured reserve.

He was eligible to return in Week 11, although Bills coach Sean McDermott said it's ""up in the air"" if Hamlin's injury is season-ending.

Hamlin started 14 games in 2024 but has played a reserve role this year with Cole Bishop and Taylor Rapp as the starting safeties. He has one tackle in five games.

DeWayne Carter, DT, Achilles

DeWayne Carter suffered a torn Achilles and will miss the entire 2025 season.

Carter, a 2024 third-round pick, recorded 14 tackles, five tackles for loss, three quarterback hits and a pass defended in 11 games last year.

Tylan Grable, OL, concussion

The 2024 sixth-rounder has been in the concussion protocol since Aug. 7 and is on IR with a return designation.

Wande Owens, S, undisclosed

The undrafted rookie was waived Aug. 23 with an injury designation and went unclaimed on waivers.

Pittsburgh Steelers injury report for Week 13

Aaron Rodgers, QB, wrist

Aaron Rodgers did not play in the Week 12 loss to the Chicago Bears. Rodgers suffered a broken bone in his left wrist in Week 11.

The 41-year-old quarterback came into Week 12 as questionable after logging limited practices on Thursday and Friday leading up to the game but was inactive.

""He fought his tail off all week, but that's the prudent play for us to make as a collective,"" Steelers coach Mike Tomin said prior to kickoff against the Bears. ""So, he won't be playing this week.""

Mason Rudolph started at quarterback and completed 24 of 31 passes for 171 yards with one touchdown and one interception as Pittsburgh fell 31-28 to Chicago.

DK Metcalf, WR, ankle

DK Metcalf hopped off the field with a left ankle injury in the second quarter of the loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday. Metcalf was evaluated by athletic trainers on the bench and went into the blue medical tent.

He returned to the game but exited in the third quarter when his ankle was rolled on while blocking on an end around to tight end Jonnu Smith.

Metcalf came back into the game and finished with five receptions for 22 yards and two carries for 12 yards and a touchdown.

Alex Highsmith, LB, pectoral

Alex Highsmith has missed the last two games with a pectoral injury.

Highsmith, 28, has 24 tackles, 5.5 sacks and a forced fumble in seven games in 2025.

Jackson sat out Monday's walk-through practice as the Ravens quickly turn the page to get ready for the AFC North rival Cincinnati Bengals on Thanksgiving night at M&T Bank Stadium.

Jackson had knee soreness after the Week 10 win in Minnesota and an ankle injury last week as he got ready for the New York Jets. This week, he's listed with a toe injury.

Asked about Jackson's health, Harbaugh said, ""he's good,"" and reiterated that Jackson is doing what he needs to win football games.

Jackson refused to blame his injury for the Ravens' offensive sluggishness the past couple weeks, and wide receiver Zay Flowers said Monday that he ""can't really tell"" if Jackson is hampered by his ailments.

""I feel like he wouldn't put himself in a bad position if he wasn't healthy,"" Flowers said. ""I don't think he would jeopardize it.""

Monday's injury report is an estimation based on the walk-through, but safety Kyle Hamilton (ankle), nose tackle Travis Jones (ankle), and defensive tackle Taven Bryan (knee) were also non-participants.

Harbaugh said Hamilton, who left the game late in the fourth quarter, will ""have a chance"" to play Thursday night. Bryan could land on short-term injured reserve.

In good news, wide receiver Rashod Bateman (ankle) and cornerback Keyon Martin (rib) returned to practice for limited work. Bateman has missed the past two games and Martin was sidelined for one.

Getting Bateman back on the field could help spark the Ravens offense, which will be going against a Bengals defense ranked last in the league with 32.7 points allowed per game.
