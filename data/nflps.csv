However, Gardner found himself back on the sidelines mid matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The cornerback has suffered another calf injury and is now questionable to return, the team announced. Already into the fourth quarter, it seems unlikely that Gardner will return for the Week 17 matchup.

If he remains out for Week 18, Gardner's debut with the Colts will end on a whimper. Indianapolis invested heavily into the cornerback, trading a pair of second-round picks to the New York Jets for his services. However, injuries have held Gardner back since his arrival.

Overall, he managed to appear in four games with the Colts, including the Jaguars battle prior to his departure. The defensive back made 16 tackles and three passes defended. Over his entire 10-game season, Gardner earned a 75.1 grade from Pro Football Focus, ranking 14/111 cornerbacks.

Entering the offseason, the Colts will be looking to get Gardner fully acclimated into their defense. He won't be swapping teams in the middle of the year. He'll be able to soak in exactly what Indianapolis wants to do and put himself in a position to make a considerable difference come 2026.

But that can't happen if Gardner isn't healthy. The first order of business will simply be getting past his calf ailment. With the Colts already eliminated, the cornerback will have plenty of time to do so.

Indianapolis sunk plenty of resources bringing Gardner to the Colts. They'll hope the results are much stronger, and healthier next season.",https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sauce-Gardner-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 23:59:49.010751

Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said following Pittsburgh's 13-6 loss that Washington has broken his arm.

Washington was seen after the game wearing a cast and sling over his injured arm. His availability moving forward is not currently known. The Steelers host the Baltimore Ravens next week in a game that will determine which team will win the AFC North and the playoff spot that comes with it.

Washington caught both of his targets for 15 yards prior to exiting Sunday's game. A former third-round pick, the 6-foot-7 Washington was in the midst of his most productive season to date with a career-high 31 catches through 16 games.

""Yeah, Darnell is a big part of what we do,"" Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said when asked about how Washington's absence impacted the offense.

If Washington is out for a significant portion of time, Jonnu Smith and Pat Freiermuth would likely have a bigger role in the offense. Neither player, however, is as good as a blocker as Jones, who is often used in offensive coordinator Arthur Smith's offense as a pseudo tackle.

Along with Washington, the Steelers played the entire game without DK Metcalf, who also won't face the Ravens next week as part of his two-game suspension stemming from last week's altercation with a Lions fan. The absences of both players clearly had a negative impact on Rodgers, who threw for just 168 yards on 21 of 39 passing.

""We didn't execute very well on third downs,"" Rodgers said. ""I didn't have a very good game. Didn't run the ball early like we wanted to. Pretty bad on third down.""

One Steelers offensive player who did have a good game Sunday was Jaylen Warren, who rushed for a game-high 64 yards on 12 carries. Warren is among Pittsburgh's skill players who will have to pick up the slack even more next week with Metcalf out and Washington's status in question.

""Nobody's panicking,"" Warren said after Sunday's game when asked about Pittsburgh's current predicament. ""I'm not worried.

Derrick Henry had a monster game, rushing for 216 yards and four touchdowns. Tyler Huntley was solid filling in for the injured Lamar Jackson, throwing for 107 yards and a touchdown and rushing for 60 yards.

In a battle of backup quarterbacks, Malik Willis was the stronger performer as he stepped in for the injured Jordan Love, throwing for 288 yards and a touchdown and rushing for 60 yards and two scores.

To reach the playoffs, Baltimore needs the Browns to beat the Steelers on Sunday, before beating Pittsburgh themselves in Week 18.

The Ravens entered Saturday needing three things to happen over the next two weeks to win the AFC North and qualify for the playoffs. They took care of the first part with their victory over the Packers. Now comes the most unlikely step. The Ravens need the last-place Browns to beat the Steelers on Sunday for the Week 18 Baltimore-Pittsburgh matchup to have any playoff ramifications.

If the Steelers win, the Ravens are eliminated from playoff contention. If the Browns pull off the upset, next week’s Ravens-Steelers game will be for the AFC North crown. At least, the Ravens have forced the Steelers to win it outright.

Micah Parsons and Devonte Wyatt aren't coming back to save this Packers run defense. In their first game without Parsons last Saturday, the Packers surrendered 150 rushing yards on 26 carries (5.8 YPC) against the Bears before allowing a whopping 308 yards on the ground from 52 carries (5.9 YPC) against the Ravens.

Derrick Henry ran all over Green Bay's depleted front for 216 yards on 36 carries (6.0 YPC). Not having their two best defensive linemen is only so much of an excuse, though, and the Packers will have to be far better up front against whoever they face in the first round of the playoffs. With a loss on Saturday, the Packers locked up the No. 7 seed for the third consecutive season.

Ravens coach John Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Todd Monken listened to questions all week about why Derrick Henry did not see the field in the final two drives of the 28-24 loss to the New England Patriots. They seemed determined not to make the same mistake again. Henry had 15 carries with less than two minutes elapsed in the second quarter. He had five games this year in which he didn’t get 15 carries.

He had 21 carries at halftime, just four off his season high. He had 27 through three quarters, two over his season high. It’s easy to question why the Ravens haven’t leaned harder on Henry all year, but for one night, they did — and the Packers struggled to stop him.

As if the Packers hadn't suffered enough injuries this season, five more players suffered injuries Saturday and were ruled out for the remainder of the game. Backup safety and ace special teamer Zayne Anderson (ankle), reserve defensive tackle Jordon Riley (Achilles) and backup cornerback Kamal Hadden (ankle) were all carted off. Cornerback Nate Hobbs (ankle) and wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks (concussion) also went down and didn't return.

Add that group to the list of defensive end Micah Parsons, tight end Tucker Kraft, defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt, center Elgton Jenkins and tight end John FitzPatrick already out for the season.

There has been plenty of talk in recent weeks about how much money Malik Willis is earning himself in the offseason. But Tyler Huntley, the Ravens’ No. 2, is doing pretty well for himself, too. Starting in place of Lamar Jackson, Huntley ran Baltimore’s offense beautifully, leading the team to its most points since Week 2. Every chance he’s gotten to play this year, he’s handled himself really well, and he’s played a key role in arguably Baltimore’s two most impressive wins this season, against Chicago and Green Bay.

Huntley had to wait around a long time this summer to get a job offer from the Browns. He probably won’t be waiting that long this coming summer.

Malik Willis is going to get a hefty bag this offseason and deservedly so. The Packers' backup quarterback continued to look like an NFL starter in completing 18-of-21 passes for 288 yards and one touchdown against Baltimore while running nine times for 60 yards and two touchdowns before re-injuring his right shoulder midway through the fourth quarter.

The Packers' acquired Willis for a seventh-round pick on the eve of the 2024 season and the deal has been a bargain. After crashing out in Tennessee, Willis has proven himself as a thrower and a runner.

Tyler Huntley also spoke after Baltimore's win: “It was a must-win and we got it done.”

Huntley says he wants to get out of his news conference so he can give his old teammate Shedeur Sanders a call and offer him encouragement. Sanders is starting for the Browns against the Steelers tomorrow, and the Ravens need Cleveland to win to remain in contention for the playoffs.

John Harbaugh speaking after Baltimore's victory: “A heart-defining win is what that was.”

He says that Derrick Henry authored one of the greatest performances he’s ever seen. He also adds that Tyler Huntley couldn’t have played any better, calling him “A plus.”

Finally, Harbaugh explains that he took the ball to start game rather than deferring because of wind considerations and he wanted to play with the lead.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/7PwzAFeNg2PQ_7CScNNeTk3lz_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-28 21:57:53.866649

Asked about the play, Valdes-Scantling said, ""The ball went up, and [Ward] did a good job of playing through me.
A loss ends the Steelers' season and gives their rival the AFC North title and playoff berth.
""Because we've done it all season,"" Rodgers said, explaining the root of that confidence.","CLEVELAND -- Pittsburgh Steelers tight end Darnell Washington sustained a broken arm in Sunday's 13-6 loss to the Cleveland Browns, coach Mike Tomlin said.

He added he doesn't know Washington's timeline to return.

Washington exited late in the first quarter as the Steelers' leading receiver at that point with 15 yards on two catches on two targets. His longest catch went for 11 yards on third-and-16. Though Washington was short of a first down, the Browns were flagged for taunting at the end of the play to continue the Steelers' drive for an eventual field goal.

""Darnell is a big part of what we do,"" said quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who completed 21 of 39 attempts for 168 yards.

Washington's absence was especially significant for an offense that also played without its top two wide receivers in DK Metcalf and Calvin Austin III (hamstring).

The Steelers will be without Metcalf, who had a season-high 148 receiving yards in the first meeting with the Baltimore Ravens, for the Week 18 de facto AFC North title game as he serves the second game of a two-game suspension for an altercation with a fan in Detroit, and now they also could be without Washington.

""It was an impact,"" Tomlin said of missing Metcalf against the Browns. ""But we certainly got capable men, and we expect those guys to make necessary plays, and we certainly didn't make enough today.""

Washington, who has 29 receptions for 349 yards and a touchdown this season, is also instrumental in the Steelers' tush push play, often the primary pusher behind tight end/fullback Connor Heyward. The Steelers lined up for only one tush push against the Browns in a play that turned out to be a fake and a 29-yard gain by Heyward.

""We get challenged with the attrition component all the time,"" Tomlin said, explaining the impact of Washington's absence on his short-yardage decision-making. ""We make no excuses regarding that. We got capable men. We adapt, adjust, and we keep moving.""

With the trio of pass catchers out, the Steelers turned to a collection of midseason pickups and under-the-radar receivers to fill the void. The group was largely ineffective as the Steelers averaged only 3.9 yards per completion and failed to score a touchdown for the first time all season.

Facing fourth-and-1 from Cleveland's 22-yard line as the Steelers trailed 10-3 late in the second quarter, Rodgers opted to take a deep shot to receiver Scotty Miller in the end zone. In the past, the Steelers have utilized the tush push in those situations. This time, though, Rodgers' 50-50 ball to Miller was too high, and the Steelers squandered a scoring opportunity created by rookie Jack Sawyer's interception of Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders.

Rodgers also targeted wide receiver Marquez Valdes-Scantling, his former Green Bay teammate who was signed from the Steelers' practice squad to the active roster earlier this month, nine times, including three in a row from Cleveland's 7-yard line with seconds left in the game.

""[Rodgers] had eligibles on the play, and certainly [Valdes-Scantling] was one of them, and he's a capable guy,"" Tomlin said. ""I got no qualms about us playing to win the game in the way that we did.""

Rodgers and Valdes-Scantling didn't appear to be on the same page for his second-and-goal throw with 24 seconds left, and Rodgers was nearly picked off by Denzel Ward in the end zone. He went back to the receiver on the next play, but again, Valdes-Scantling wasn't where Rodgers anticipated him to be. This time, Rodgers threw inside, but the receiver stayed wide on the right side of the end zone.

With one final shot to tie the score, Rodgers again looked for Valdes-Scanting, but this time he was blanketed by Ward, and the pass fell incomplete.

""That was definitely interference,"" Rodgers said of the fourth-down play by Ward on Valdes-Scantling.

Asked about the play, Valdes-Scantling said, ""The ball went up, and [Ward] did a good job of playing through me. I thought I could've got a call, but no call was made. That's what it was.""

Tight end Pat Freiermuth finished as the Steelers' leading receiver with 63 yards on three receptions in five targets.

With the loss, the Steelers enter Week 18 facing the highest stakes of the season. A win against the Ravens would send Pittsburgh to the postseason. A loss ends the Steelers' season and gives their rival the AFC North title and playoff berth.

Rodgers, though, expressed confidence in his team to bounce back.

""Because we've done it all season,"" Rodgers said, explaining the root of that confidence. ""We've handled adversity well, and when we had to play our best ball, we did -- other than today.""",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1228%2Fr1594453_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 19:57:48.424133

“Looking forward to see the game plan the Pats come up with today with the injuries they’re dealing with,” Hoyer wrote on X before Sunday’s game. “Losing Hollins crushed my soul!”

Hoyer won a Super Bowl with the Patriots in 2018. Hoyer played in 30 games for the Patriots over the course of eight seasons, serving as a backup for most of his career. He played more games for the Patriots than any of the other seven teams he played on in his 15-year career.

Hollins has been a phenomenal addition to the Patriots. He was third on the team in receptions and receiving yards. He had played 68% of the Patriots’ snaps on offense this year, which is more than any other receiver.

The biggest reason Hollins stays on the field is because of his ability as a blocker. At 6-foot-4, 221 pounds, his size plays a huge role in the run game. He is an important part of what the Patriots are trying to achieve in the ground game, but his build makes him different than the other receivers on the team.

Story continues below advertisement

Hollins has been a great presence in the middle of the field, catching balls in traffic, but he is also a real deep threat that challenges defensive backs in the air. The Patriots do not have a direct replacement for his size in the receiver room, so younger players will need to step up in their own way.

Hollins could return at some point this season, but it will take a deep run in the playoffs. He could be eligible to return in the AFC Championship Game or the Super Bowl.

Several of their key players will be unavailable as their disappointing years wind down. Both teams are in last place in their divisions and completely out of the playoff race.

What’s the New York Giants Injury Report for Week 17?

The Giants will enter Week 17 of the 2025 NFL season with just a 2-13 record as they have lost each of their past nine consecutive games. Their focus can now turn to the future, especially continuing to develop promising rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, but they will be without several of their key players when they take on the Raiders this week.

Star offensive tackle Andrew Thomas, an important protector of Dart, has officially been ruled out with a hamstring injury. He was unable to practice at all this week, so his injury designation doesn’t come as much of a surprise, but his absence is surely notable.

New York will also be missing other key offensive linemen in John Michael Schmitz and Evan Neal, so their protection will be compromised against Las Vegas. They will also be without starting tight end Theo Johnson, further weakening their offense as a whole. He was a late addition to their injury report with an illness that resulted in him being inactive for this contest.

Their defensive secondary will be missing safety Tyler Nubin, who was held out of practice all week with a neck injury. On the positive side, cornerback Deonte Banks does not have a designation on the final injury report, despite being limited at practice with a shoulder injury.

What’s the Las Vegas Raiders Injury Report for Week 17?

The Raiders will also enter this game with a 2-13 record amid their disappointing 2025 NFL season in their first year with head coach Pete Carroll. They have several key names on their injury report as well, including some of their best overall players on both sides of the ball.

Brock Bowers was put on the injured reserve list this week with a knee injury, which officially ends his year. He was having another strong campaign as the eighth-ranked tight end in PFSN’s Impact Rankings for this season, but will now be unavailable for their final two games.

He is joined by their superstar edge rusher, Maxx Crosby, who has also been ruled out with a knee injury of his own. He reportedly wanted to play in this game against the Giants, despite not practicing all week, but Las Vegas still decided to rule him out when they take on New York.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/28104925/giants-raiders-injury-report-12-28-25-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 19:58:12.347968

At halftime, with the Colts leading 10-7, Thomas hasn’t been too involved and also suffered an injury

What’s Happening With Jaguars WR Brian Thomas Jr.?

In that second quarter, Thomas spent time on the Jaguars’ sideline getting checked out.

According to a report from ESPN Jaguars reporter Michael DiRocco, Thomas was being checked out for an ankle injury.

“Trainers were looking at Brian Thomas Jr. left ankle/foot,” DiRocco wrote. “He’s on the sideline now, walking around.”

Thomas only has one catch for four yards and has only been targeted by Lawrence on that one play. Thomas did return to the game, but his injury situation will be worth keeping an eye on as the game progresses.

Thomas was a first-round draft choice (No. 23 overall) by the Jaguars in the 2024 NFL Draft. He played his college ball at LSU.

According to the PFSN NFL WR Impact metrics, Thomas has an impact score of 71.1 and grades out to a C-. So far this season, Thomas has 41 catches for 619 yards and two touchdown receptions. He’s averaging 15.1 yards per catch for Jacksonville this season, which has really helped Lawrence and the Jaguars’ offense.

In almost two seasons with Jacksonville, Thomas has 128 catches for 1,901 yards and 12 touchdown receptions. His career-long reception is an 85-yarder, which came in his rookie season. One thing that Thomas has going for him is ball control. He’s not fumbled once while playing with the Jaguars.

Is Thomas an option when the Jaguars look to run the ball? It’s a rather small sample size, but he has nine carries for 69 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown.

While Thomas has returned to the game against the Colts, a big one for Jacksonville, head coach Liam Coen and the team’s medical personnel will closely monitor him. Jacksonville really needs all hands on deck against Indianapolis and quarterback Philip Rivers.

But the Jaguars are going to have to come back in the second half after going into halftime down three points. Let’s see if Thomas has a bigger role in the Jaguars’ offense.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/28141439/auto-draft-12-28-25-9-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 15:58:01.948806

“Steelers TE Darnell Washington has a forearm injury and is questionable to return to today's game,” Lauten wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

The news didn't get any better as Washington was later ruled out for the game. It was a big development for the Steelers, as they're already without DK Metcalf after he was suspended for the last two games of the regular season because of the incident he had with a Detroit Lions fan last week.

Aaron Rodgers now has to find a way to spread the ball around to his other receivers, and he may have to rely on the run game, which has not been that effective this season. Nonetheless, the Steelers have found ways to win with less this season, and as long as Rodgers is playing, they have a chance.

The offense is the only group for the Steelers who is missing key players. TJ Watt has missed the past few games because of a lung injury, but he should be back on the field. Despite the injuries, the Steelers are still at the top of the AFC North, and the Baltimore Ravens are creeping right behind them. A win or a tie against the Browns will help them clinch the division.

On the other hand, if they were to lose, then it would come down to the final week of the season to decide who will win the division. between them and the Ravens.

Jacksonville are chasing a 12-win season for the third time in franchise history. They will not be able to match the 14 wins of 1999, but can level the 12 wins of 2005. Jacksonville have won six in a row with Indianapolis losing their last five. After locking up a playoff place, a win will keep Jacksonville on top of the AFC South after Houston’s win yesterday.

Trevor Lawrence is humming - he has 10 touchdowns in his last two games (eight passing and two rushing) - and the passing game is one of the league’s most productive and varied, with five different leading receivers in their last five games. But the ground game has stalled somewhat. In their last four games, the Jags average 90.5 rushing yards per game, fewest in the NFL. No one has scored more touchdowns than Travis Etienne since Week 11 (9), but he is without a 100-yard rushing game since Week 4’s win over the 49ers.

And the offensive line has been in a constant flux all season, a trend that continues. Right guard Patrick Mekari (back) and center Robert Hainsey (groin) miss today’s game.

Without the ball, Anthony Campanile’s unit is still the NFL’s No 1 run defense, with Jacksonville allowing 81 rushing yards per game in their last six games. With 28 takeaways, second-most in the NFL, Jacksonville have scored 100 points off takeaways, the highest in the league.

How many yards will Joe Burrow and the Bengals passing attack be able to put up today? The Cardinals defense is beat up and has not played well. Their injured corners were listed as questionable and are active on Sunday, but it still presents a significant mismatch against a full healthy Bengals passing attack. They showed off where they are at least week ripping off 45 points against the Dolphins, Burrow throwing for four touchdowns and 309 yards. The potential exists for this game to go in a similar fashion. Expect the Cardinals to bring pressure early and often to try to cause disruption, which opens up the possibility of Burrow finding explosive plays to Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, among others.

A true win for the Bengals on Sunday would involve Burrow and the receivers staying healthy considering neither team has anything to play for, but adding one more dominant offensive performance wouldn't hurt considering nearly the entire offense is back under contract next season.

Defensively, seeing production from Shemar Stewart would go a long way. He's finally back playing and healthy but wasn't much of a factor last week against the Dolphins coming back off IR. He's one player that could use positive momentum to help launch him into a critical offseason after what feels like a wasted rookie year.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. – The Patriots are entering Sunday’s game here against the Jets with only four wide receivers active since their top two receivers (in terms of playing time) are sidelined.

So without Mack Hollins (abdomen) and Kayshon Boutte (concussion) a bigger role is going to fall on rookie receivers Kyle Williams and Efton Chism.

Williams, a third-round pick in April, has played better of late after a slow start, but still has just seven catches this season, though he’s turned those receptions into 189 yards and three touchdowns. Chism was a training camp standout, but has been a healthy scratch in nine of 15 games this season and doesn’t yet have a reception.

Stefon Diggs will be the team’s no-doubt top receiver on Sunday. But if he draws extra attention from the Jets’ defense, Williams or Chism may need to step up. So it’ll be interesting to see how the rookie receivers respond on a day the Patriots enter with a banged-up roster, hopeful some of their young players will aptly fill the void.

The Browns will have their leading receiver, tight end Harold Fannin Jr. available for today's game vs. Pittsburgh despite a late-week injury scare.

Fannin has been targeted by Shedeur Sanders 42 times in Sanders' five starts, and Fannin's 70 receptions this season are a franchise single-season record for a rookie. Fannin was listed as questionable after he suffered a groin injury in practice on Friday, but the Browns went through their weekend activities believing Fannin would be able to play.

Sanders, Fannin and Myles Garrett remain the primary reasons Browns fans might still be watching as their 3-12 team tries to play spoiler against a Steelers team that clinches the AFC North with a win. Garrett has 22 sacks and is just a half-sack short of the single-season record currently shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt, who won't play today due to injury.

With No. 1 wide receiver D.K. Metcalf serving a two-game suspension, expect the Steelers to focus on the run and a quick pass game focused on their tight ends and running backs. That might or might not also include an extra emphasis on avoiding and minimizing Garrett, which is something the Browns see almost every week. The last time Garrett didn't have at least a half-sack in a game was Week 6 in Pittsburgh, and Garrett has never sacked Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

Sanders is trying to play his way into the team's future plans, and he'll have to operate today without primary running back Quinshon Judkins, who suffered a season-ending leg injury last week. Running back Dylan Sampson returns from a hand injury and figures to lead a running back committee that will also include Raheim Sanders and Trayveon Williams. Sanders has thrown six touchdown passes and eight interceptions and today faces a veteran Pittsburgh defense that wants to force turnovers on its way to clinching the division.

The Browns have Pro Bowl cornerback Denzel Ward back from a two-game absence. Slot cornerback Myles Harden will not play today due to a shoulder injury.

Dillon Gabriel, the Browns' usual backup quarterback, is inactive today due to a shoulder injury. The Browns promoted Bailey Zappe from the practice squad to be Sanders' backup. Besides Gabriel, and Harden, the Browns' other inactives are tight end David Njoku (knee), defensive tackle Sam Kamara (elbow), wide receiver Jamari Thrash and backup offensive linemen Jerremiah Byers and Kendrick Green.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. – The Patriots probably aren’t going to lose to the Jets, but this is a surprisingly big test for them as the playoffs loom.

That’s because the Patriots are dealing with a lengthy injury report that could linger into the postseason. So Sunday’s matchup against the Jets, while not expected to be a nailbiter, could be revealing about how ready the Patriots are.

There are two especially interesting positions to follow.

The first is wide receiver. The Pats placed Mack Hollins, who has played more at receiver for them than anyone else, on injured reserve Saturday due to an abdomen injury. They’re also without Kayshon Boutte (concussion), who has played the second-most snaps for them at wide receiver. They only have four healthy wide receivers entering Sunday’s game here, so expect plenty of jumbo formations from them with a focus on running the ball.

The second spot is defensive tackle. While Milton Williams, the team’s highest-paid player, was cleared to return to practice this week, he was not activated off injured reserve before the game. Additionally, Khyiris Tonga (foot) was ruled out of Sunday’s game, so the Patriots will enter with an inexperienced rotation of Cory Durden, Eric Gregory, Jeremiah Pharms Jr., and Leonard Taylor III. There’s opportunity there for the Jets to run the ball on this D-line.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/h6xAKkNbrCFg_Yt7BFCFJxQKR_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-28 12:58:51.254177

George Kittle, TE, SF (ankle): The fantasy playoffs and Sunday night game-time calls do not go well together, but here we are.
Theo Johnson, TE, NYG (illness): He's not traveling to Vegas, so either Daniel Bellinger or Chris Manhertz could collect his targets.
Mason Taylor, TE, NYJ (neck): Stone Smartt and Jeremy Ruckert will split the TE duties, with Smartt more likely to end up in the box score.
Tetairoa McMillan, WR, CAR (illness): McMillan was added to the injury report Sunday morning, which certainly raised a lot of red flags.","Rome Odunze, WR, CHI (foot): Odunze was ruled out early in the week, but Luther Burden III (ankle) was removed from the team's final injury report. Burden may be the most reliable option at receiver because both DJ Moore and Olamide Zaccheaus were added to the Bears' injury report on Sunday morning due to illness. Those receivers are now both questionable.

George Kittle, TE, SF (ankle): The fantasy playoffs and Sunday night game-time calls do not go well together, but here we are. It's best to have Jake Tonges available for a potential pivot, because reports from Sunday morning seem to indicate that Kittle is unlikely to play.

Ricky Pearsall, WR, SF (knee): If the injury-plagued receiver can't go, then Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson would likely get some extra looks. However, as of Sunday morning, it was looking likely that Pearsall would play.

Matt Prater, K, BUF (quad): Michael Badgley gets another opportunity to prove he still belongs on an NFL roster.

Anthony Richardson Sr., QB, IND (eye): He's not going to be activated from IR this week, so both Philip Rivers and Riley Leonard will be active for the Colts. Houston won on Saturday, eliminating Indianapolis from playoff contention, so aside from ""nostalgia,"" it makes little sense to start Rivers anymore -- but that won't stop it from happening.

Jason Sanders, K, MIA (hip): Sanders continues to practice with the team, but he is clearly not yet ready to be activated from IR. Riley Patterson continues to handle kicking duties.

Kayshon Boutte, WR, NE (concussion): There are only three fully healthy WR options for the Patriots: Stefon Diggs, Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III.

Mack Hollins, WR, NE (abdomen): Hollins goes on IR. DeMario Douglas (hamstring) is active, but we still may see a little extra work for No. 2 TE Austin Hooper.

Alvin Kamara, RB, NO (knee): Audric Estime and jack-of-all-trades Taysom Hill will likely split backfield duties.

Theo Johnson, TE, NYG (illness): He's not traveling to Vegas, so either Daniel Bellinger or Chris Manhertz could collect his targets.

Mason Taylor, TE, NYJ (neck): Stone Smartt and Jeremy Ruckert will split the TE duties, with Smartt more likely to end up in the box score. As expected, QB Tyrod Taylor is also inactive.

Calvin Austin III, WR, PIT (hamstring): The unlikely combination of Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Adam Thielen will lead the way in the Steelers' WR room, with DK Metcalf serving the first of a two-game suspension.

Marvin Harrison Jr., WR, ARI (heel): He was limited in practice again this week but is active. While we'd expect him to play at least a little bit Sunday, Michael Wilson should be the WR1 for the Cardinals, with Xavier Weaver also likely to get more looks.

Joshua Karty, K, ARI: If you're one of the 3% of ESPN fantasy managers with Karty still in your lineup this morning, get him out of there. He's a healthy inactive as the Cardinals have opted to stick with Chad Ryland at kicker this week.

Tetairoa McMillan, WR, CAR (illness): McMillan was added to the injury report Sunday morning, which certainly raised a lot of red flags. He is active, but you may have to hold your breath while watching.

Dylan Sampson, RB, CLE (hand): He's active and likely to handle lead back duties. Raheim Sanders and Trayveon Williams should work in tandem as backup options.

Harold Fannin Jr., TE, CLE (groin): Fannin was a late-week add to the injury report, but especially given that David Njoku is still out, all signs pointed to him playing. He is active.

Bhayshul Tuten, RB, JAX (finger): Tuten has been downgraded to out in advance of Sunday's release of inactives. LeQuint Allen Jr. will back up Travis Etienne Jr. on Sunday, though there still remains a possibility we see Tuten again before the season is over.

Charlie Smyth, K, NO (illness): The Saints don't have any other kickers on the roster and made no efforts to rectify that situation in advance of Sunday, so it's no surprise that Smyth is active.

Chris Olave, WR, NO (back): Since Olave traveled with the team to Tennessee, it's not a surprise to see he is active. Mason Tipton (groin), however, is inactive.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1228%2Fr1594209_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 15:58:18.989928

TreVeyon Henderson - Patriots (RB)

Henderson suffered a concussion in the win over the Ravens during Week 16. His progression through the NFL's concussion protocol has cleared him to play today against the New York Jets. The Patriots can secure the AFC East with a win and a loss by the Bills.

George Kittle - 49ers (TE)

Kittle sustained an ankle injury against the Colts on Monday Night Football. He will be a game-time decision for Week 17 in a game against the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football. The 49ers have earned a playoff spot already, but can secure a top seed with a win in their final two games, which means Kittle will more than likely give it a go.

Marvin Harrison Jr. - Cardinals (WR)

Harrison Jr. will play in the Week 17 matchup against the Bengals after returning last week from missing two games. He may be limited in this one, so he would be more of a (sit) option this week to be on the safe side.

Injuries are playing a major part of the Week 17 schedule, and bettors looking to place NFL bets for Week 17 need to know the most important NFL injuries of the week, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.

Seahawks at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams are in good shape in the health department for this pivotal Week 17 clash. The Seahawks are in the driver's seat for both the NFC West crown as well as the No. 1 seed in the conference. Carolina knocked off Tampa Bay last week and, with a win and Bucs loss this week, could clinch the NFC South. Otherwise, Week 18 could be a massive matchup for the division title.

Seattle is favored by 7. The total is 42.5.

Buccaneers at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams have a few players banged up here, but none that move the needle when it comes to betting lines. The Bucs are a game behind the Panthers in the NFC South and, with a win, would ensure that Week 18's rematch with Carolina has high stakes.

The Buccaneers are 5.5-point favorites, and the total is 44.5

Patriots at Jets (1 p.m. ET)

NE RB TreVeyon Henderson (concussion, available)

NE WR Kayshon Boutte (concussion, out)

NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)

New England standout running back TreVeyon Henderson has cleared concussion protocol for Sunday while New York is again without tight end Mason Taylor, who was a rare bright spot in a trying year for the Jets. Explosive Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte is out with a concussion.

The Pats are massive 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.

Steelers at Browns (1 p.m. ET)

CLE RB Quinshon Judkins (ankle, out for year)

CLE RB Dylan Sampson (hand, available)

CLE TE Harold Fannin Jr. (groin, available)

CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)

PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)

The Browns are looking to play spoiler here, and their offense is hurting. Star rookie back Quinshon Judkins is out for the year after ankle surgery, so fellow rookie Dylan Sampson is the team's RB1 this week. He's active after missing the last two games. David Njoku is out again with a knee injury and fellow tight end, standout rookie Harold Fannin Jr., is good to play. The Steelers will still be without T.J. Watt this week after the star edge rusher underwent surgery to repair a collapsed lung. He returned to practice this week but will not suit up until Week 18 at the earliest.

Pittsburgh is a 3-point favorite on the road, and the total is 34.5 -- the lowest of Week 17.

Jaguars at Colts (1 p.m. ET)

IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, available)

The Jags are relatively healthy here, while the Colts, who started the year 8-2, are trying to win out and get some help to sneak into the postseason as a wild card team. Indianapolis traded two first-round picks at the deadline for cornerback Sauce Gardner, who will return to the lineup after a lengthy absence. The Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win here if the Texans also lose to or tie with the Chargers on Saturday.

Jacksonville is a 5.5-point favorite. The total is 48.5.

Saints at Titans (1 p.m. ET)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)

NO WR Chris Olave (back, available)

The Saints will again be without standout running back Alvin Kamara, though they found an interesting replacement last week in tight end/quarterback/running back hybrid Taysom Hill, who had 78 yards from scrimmage and also a passing score to Chris Olave, who is good to go after being listed as questionable.

The Saints are favored by 2.5, and the total is 39.5.

Cardinals at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)

ARI S Budda Baker (concussion and thumb, out)

ARI WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, available)

Both teams have crowded injury reports, but the Cardinals continue to have some awful luck in that department for Week 17. Star safety Budda Baker is out, putting a dent in an already poor Arizona defense. The offense got Marvin Harrison Jr. back last week and he's active again this week despite battling a heel injury.

The Bengals are 7.5-point favorites. The total is 53.5 -- the highest of the week.

Giants at Raiders (4:05 p.m. ET)

LV DE Maxx Crosby (knee, out)

LV TE Brock Bowers (knee, out for year)

Star Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby is out this week against the Giants, and there's reportedly drama between him and the team. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, the Raiders told Crosby they wanted to shut him down for the remaining two games, and he disagreed and left the facility. Additionally, the team placed second-year tight end Brock Bowers on season-ending injured reserve this week.

New York is a slim 1.5-point favorite. The total is 41.5.

Eagles at Bills (4:25 p.m. ET)

BUF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, questionable)

BUF TE Dawson Knox (knee, questionable)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (knee, foot, out)

Buffalo's tight end depth may get tested here with both Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox questionable with knee injuries in this potential Super Bowl preview against last year's champs, the Eagles. Philadelphia will get star defensive tackle Jalen Carter back after a brief absence, but it won't have right tackle Lane Johnson once again.

Buffalo is a 1.5-point favorite, and the total is 43.5.

Bears at 49ers (8:20 p.m. ET)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, out)

SF TE George Kittle (ankle, questionable)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)

This potential NFL playoff preview has a few big-name pass catchers out or questionable. The Bears will again be down second-year receiver Rome Odunze as he battles a foot injury, and Chicago will certainly be aiming to get him back for the postseason. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is questionable after not practicing all week while receiver Ricky Pearsall is in danger of missing his ninth game of the year.

San Francisco is favored by 3, and the total is 52.5.

Rams at Falcons (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, doubtful)

ATL WR Drake London (knee, questionable)

All eyes are on the status of two star receivers as Davante Adams, who leads the NFL in touchdown receptions, is doubtful for the Rams after missing last week's loss to Seattle while Drake London is questionable for Atlanta as he continues to battle a nagging knee injury. The Rams can help themselves in two ways on Sunday as a win helps their playoff standing and also pushes the Falcons further up the NFL Draft order, which is good for L.A. as the team owns Atlanta's first-round pick in April.

Los Angeles is a 7.5-point road favorite. The total is 49.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/11/01/af98ef3e-bf37-4fb4-b709-ff1245354c74/thumbnail/1200x675/0f2b540740d60034c95d45a86cefd9cc/treveyon-henderson-new-england-patriots-imagn-images.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 15:58:28.711036

Josh Allen - Bills (QB)

Josh Allen suffered a foot injury in a win against the Cleveland Browns last week. He is expected to play and not miss any time, as the Bills (11-4) look to close the gap on the New England Patriots (12-3) in the AFC East.

TreVeyon Henderson - Patriots (RB)

Henderson suffered a concussion in the win over the Ravens during Week 16. His progression through the NFL's concussion protocol has cleared him to play today against the New York Jets. The Patriots can secure the AFC East with a win and a loss by the Bills.

George Kittle - 49ers (TE)

Kittle sustained an ankle injury against the Colts on Monday Night Football. He will be a game-time decision for Week 17 in a game against the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football.

A toe injury will keep him on the sideline for a critical Week 17 matchup, and undrafted rookie Benjamin Chukwuma will start in his place, protecting Baker Mayfield's blind side. It will be the second career start for Chukwuma, who was impressive in his debut against the New Orleans Saints in Week 14.

The Buccaneers ruled out Wirfs and outside linebacker Anthony Nelson (knee) on Friday but otherwise didn't have any question marks headed into the weekend. With Nelson out, Jason Pierre-Paul will likely see more playing time after being elevated from the practice squad for the second week in a row. The Buccaneers need a win on Sunday to ensure that they will be playing for first place in the NFC South in Week 18 against Carolina.

Veteran linebacker Anthony Walker, who played for the Dolphins in 2024, will be active for the first time as a Buccaneer after re-signing with the team on December 15. Walker originally signed with the Buccaneers during the 2025 offseason but spent training camp in the reserve/NFI list and was released in the roster cutdown to 53 in late August. He was on the Indianapolis Colts' practice squad for the balance of the season before the Buccaneers brought him back. Walker has played in 99 NFL regular-season games with 83 starts, including 14 games and eight starts last season for Miami.

The Buccaneers and Dolphins submitted their list of inactives at 11:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, 90 minutes before the scheduled kickoff of their Week 17 meeting at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. The Buccaneers elevated Pierre-Paul from their practice squad for the game and thus had to name six inactives to get down to the game-day limit of 48. The Dolphins had 52 players on their active roster after a series of moves on Saturday and elevated linebacker Derrick McLendon and offensive lineman Josh Priebe from the practice squad to get to 54. That meant they also had to name six players inactive before the game.

The Dolphins will be without starting safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, who is dealing with a calf injury. Miami also had listed cornerback Isaiah Johnson, defensive lineman Benito Jones and wide receiver Dee Eskridge as either out our doubtful on their Friday injury report, but all three were subsequently placed on injured reserve.

Unfortunately, his exceptional performance today might wind up being in vain.

Against the Lamar Jackson-less Baltimore Ravens at Lambeau Field, Willis was doing a pretty good job of moving the ball. He completed 18 of 21 passes for 288 yards and a touchdown while running the ball nine times for 60 yards and two more touchdowns. The rest of the Packers backfield had just nine yards combined.

Throughout the game, fans were gushing over Willis' performance with many remarking that he might have played himself into a massive free agent contract and possibly even a starting job somewhere in 2026.

Sadly, Willis' heroic effort ended on a sour note. He suffered a shoulder injury in the fourth quarter which knocked him out of the game. Backup Clayton Tune came in but threw an interception on his first pass, which the Ravens then used to start a sustained drive that helped them seal the game.

Bad Timing

The game itself didn't matter to Green Bay other than playoff seeding and when Love returns he'll be the one leading the team's postseason push.

As for Willis, the injury might be costly to his own future if it's bad. He was already playing through the game with the shoulder slightly injured but decided to fight on.

Quickly, Willis stood up and ran off to the locker room. That paved the way for Clayton Tune to come in and replace him.

Tune, after scrambling for no gain on his first play, then threw a ball intended for Bo Melton that was intercepted by Marlon Humphrey deep in Ravens territory.

The team initially said that Willis was questionable to return with a right shoulder injury. Further specifics are not yet known. He came running back out from the locker room a few moments later, but the game was well out of reach by the time the Packers got the ball back. The Ravens killed most of the clock in his absence and rolled to the 17-point win, which kept their playoff hopes alive. Tune finished the game in the final seconds.

Willis got the start Saturday night in place of Jordan Love, who was ruled out with a concussion he suffered last week in Green Bay's loss to the Chicago Bears. Willis also injured his shoulder in that game, though he finished it out after replacing Love, and was considered questionable with the injury in the lead up to Saturday night.

But the Green Bay Packers have failed to overcome them in the last three games.

From losing star defensive end Micah Parsons to a season-ending ACL tear two weeks ago in Denver to quarterback Jordan Love missing the second half of the Chicago Bears game and the entire matchup with the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion, this team has had its share of bad luck with injuries, but they refuse to use it as an excuse.

“Guys going down all over the league, that ain’t just happening to us, you know what I mean?” Packers nickel back Javon Bullard said. “No matter how we put it, we’ve got to ball. We get paid to ball.

Here's an update on the Packers injury situation as they head into the final week of the regular season:

Jordan Love didn't clear concussion protocol

The Packers announced the day before kickoff of their Week 17 game against the Ravens that Love was downgraded from questionable to out, giving Malik Willis the nod to start. Packers coach Matt LaFleur said Love didn’t clear the concussion protocol to play.

“There’s a lot of tests you’ve got to pass,” LaFleur said. “Unfortunately, he just – I think he’s feeling physically good, but they have those measures in place obviously to protect our players, and he didn’t pass the necessary tests to clear the protocol.”

In addition to Love, starting right tackle Zach Tom (knee) missed his second straight game.

Willis, who was dealing with a shoulder injury he suffered in Chicago, exited the fourth quarter of the Ravens game, but LaFleur said he could’ve returned if necessary.

""When you come in, we expect you to play at the same standard that everybody else is playing – that Packers standard,"" Packers defensive end Lukas Van Ness said. ""Injuries are tough, but it's an unfortunate part of the game. We'll have to find ways for whether it's first, second or third string to rally and play up to the standard, because we're going to need everybody going into the postseason and this last game.""

In-game injuries pile up vs. Ravens

Zayne Anderson

A backup safety and key member of the special teams, Zayne Anderson limped off the field after a first-half kickoff return and was carted back to the locker room. He was ruled out the rest of the game with an ankle injury.

Jordon Riley

The Packers were already thin on the defensive line and missed productivity from Parsons and Devonte Wyatt when they lost another defensive tackle. Jordon Riley was ruled out with an Achilles injury during the game. Riley joined the Packers earlier this month off the New York Giants’ practice squad. He had two solo tackles in four games played.

Nate Hobbs

Packers cornerback Nate Hobbs has had knee injuries throughout his debut season in Green Bay and suffered another setback against the Ravens. Coming off one of his best performances last week against the Bears, Hobbs left the second quarter of the Ravens game due to a knee injury. It happened when Hobbs collided with Ravens receiver Zay Flowers in the end zone.

Dontayvion Wicks

Wide receiver Dontayvion Wicks missed the second half after being evaluated for a concussion.

Kamal Hadden

Backup cornerback Kamal Hadden had a tough break. Getting some snaps in place of Carrington Valentine, Hadden suffered an ankle injury while being part of a tackle on Derrick Henry. He was carted off the field. LaFleur said he had no updates on injuries, but did say Hadden’s ""didn’t look good.""

“I feel terrible for him,” LaFleur said. “It’s one of those unfortunate things that happens in football.”

LaFleur says it's too early for decision on playing Jordan Love in Minnesota

When the Detroit Lions lost to the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas, the Packers clinched a playoff spot.

The team now will have to decide if they want to play starters for the regular-season finale in Minnesota or rest guys before the wild-card playoff round.

When it comes to Love playing next week, LaFleur is taking it day by day.

In the fourth quarter, though, Green Bay turned it over on downs on the 13-yard line. They responded on the next drive by scoring their lone touchdown of the day, giving them a 13-13 tied score, before the Panthers drove 40 yards to kick the game-winning field goal as time expired.

The only true turnover of this game was Josh Jacobs’ fumble near the goal line. With that being said, the Packers were particularly bad in the red zone in this game, as they went into the red zone five times but never came away with a touchdown.

Green Bay turned the ball over on downs on the first drive of the game and the lone drive in overtime. They also allowed the clock to expire in both the first and second halves of the game.

Baltimore Ravens @ Green Bay Packers

Despite Malik Willis playing well as Jordan Love’s replacement starter, Green Bay just wasn’t able to stop the Baltimore rushing offense. Even though the team scored 24 points, which usually is enough to be at least competitive in most NFL games, the Ravens dropped 41 on the Packers.

Green Bay turned the ball over on downs twice, once in garbage time when Clayton Tune was already under center, fumbled once when the snap from Sean Rhyan came too early while Willis was attempting to audible, Tune threw an interception and the Packers also ran out the clock to end the first half. But no punts!

The defeat marked the end of an era for the Bills, who had dominated the AFC for years.

Dec. 28, 1996 - Jaguars 30, Bills 27

One of my most indelible moments that occurred at One Bills Drive actually did not take place inside the stadium, but over at the adjacent fieldhouse where 36-year-old Jim Kelly announced his retirement on Jan. 31, 1997.

It was a massive event with hundreds of people in attendance, all of the Buffalo TV stations as well as ESPN interrupting their morning programming and broadcasting live, just as they’d done back in August 1986 when Kelly first arrived in Buffalo.

There were plenty of teary eyes that day as the best quarterback to ever play for the Bills -- at least before Josh Allen came along -- bid farewell.

""To leave and not be a part of this football team is something that will be very difficult to swallow, but I also know in my stomach and in my heart, it's time for Jim Kelly to move on,"" Kelly said, pausing occasionally as the weight of the words overcame him.

And one of the deciding factors for Kelly had happened a little more than a month earlier when the Bills were upset by the two-year-old Jacksonville Jaguars in an AFC wild-card game, a 30-27 defeat that was the first postseason loss in the history of the stadium.

That day the upstart Jaguars -- coached by Waterloo native Tom Coughlin -- stunned NFL nation as Natrone Means ran for 175 yards and a touchdown, Mark Brunell threw for 239 yards and a TD, and the Jacksonville defense knocked Kelly out of the game with a concussion midway through the fourth quarter.

On that play, with the score tied at 27 and the Bills at midfield, Kelly got drilled by safety Chris Hudson and lost a fumble that Hudson also recovered at the Jaguars 42. Eight plays later, with 3:07 left to play, Mike Hollis kicked a 45-yard go-ahead field goal. With Todd Collins forced into action as Kelly was being carted into the locker room, the Bills were done.

I’ll never forget the silence that enveloped the stadium that day as more than 70,000 fans could not believe that a Jaguars team that had just entered the NFL as an expansion franchise in 1995 had beaten Buffalo.

But in reality you could see it coming as the Bills were a team that had started to age and had finished 10-6 and in second place in the AFC East. And Kelly, ravaged for so many years by injuries, was clearly in decline as his 73.2 passer rating was the lowest of his career; he threw just 14 touchdowns compared to 19 interceptions.

Center Kent Hull, who announced his retirement almost immediately after the game, put it into perfect perspective as he always did when he said of the young and hungry Jaguars, “They seemed like the team that we used to be. They were an opportunistic team that made plays when they had to have them and that’s the reason they won.”

In that locker room, you could sense the Bills knew their glory years -- six AFC East titles, four AFC championships between 1988-95 -- were behind them. Thurman Thomas sat at his locker silent and dazed for about 10 minutes after the media was allowed in.

Linebacker David White said, “It’s a shock.”

Yeah, it was.

Everything seemed fine early as the Bills opened a 14-7 lead on a pair of Thomas TDs, one on a pass from Kelly, the other a short run. But the Jaguars were even at 17 by halftime, and still even at 20 late in the third quarter when the play that felt like it would finally turn the game in Buffalo’s favor happened.

White tipped a Brunell pass that Jeff Burris intercepted on the second play of the fourth quarter and returned 38 yards for a touchdown.

Said Hull: “The trait of this team in the past is that when we had to make a play, someone always found a way to make one. I thought that play was the interception for the touchdown.”

Instead, Jacksonville put together a 65-yard drive that was extended by a Means fourth-down run and was capped by Brunell’s tying two-yard TD pass to Jimmy Smith.

Barely a minute later, Kelly was down on the field, the Jaguars were celebrating a fumble recovery and you knew it was slipping away from the Bills.

With an expiring contract, Kelly’s future in Buffalo with the franchise he essentially saved and drove to unprecedented heights was already in doubt, but the concussion seemed to bring clarity to both him and the organization. This was certainly not the way a future Hall of Famer’s career should have ended, but sometimes you can’t go out on your own terms.

Eleven years, 35,467 passing yards, 237 touchdown passes, eight playoff seasons, four Super Bowls and countless thrills along the way, it was quite a ride for Kelly.

""This is going to be one tough act to follow,"" Marv Levy said. Sure was as it took Buffalo more than 20 years to find Kelly’s rightful successor in Allen.

Myles Garrett resumes his quest to break the NFL’s single-season sacks record Sunday when the Cleveland Browns host the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Garrett has 22 sacks on the season and stands a half-sack short of the record shared by Michael Strahan and the Steelers’ T.J. Watt, who won’t play Sunday due to injury.

With a half-sack last week versus Buffalo, Garrett became just the sixth player to reach 22 in a season. On Sunday, Garrett will try to break the record while recording his first career sack against a player with whom he’ll almost certainly one day share space in the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

“(Rodgers) is legendary himself, and it’s a legendary record I’m here chasing,” Garrett said. “That’d be a great one to put a picture on the wall with.”

Garrett has not sacked Rodgers in two previous games, one earlier this season and one in 2021 when Rodgers was with Green Bay. But Garrett has recorded at least a half-sack in every game after the first Cleveland-Pittsburgh meeting, in Week 6. Sunday brings Garrett a chance to break the single-season record in his home stadium.

Earlier this season, Garrett passed Lawrence Taylor to become the first player with at least 12 sacks in six consecutive seasons. With 124 1/2 sacks in 132 games, Garrett holds the NFL record for most sacks recorded before a player’s 30th birthday. Reggie White was the record-holder at 108. Only White (137) had more sacks in his first nine seasons.

“That is something that I had in my mind coming into the league, being talked about among those greats,” Garrett said. “So, I just want to continue to just put myself into that conversation.”

Garrett, who turns 30 on Monday, has totaled five sacks in the Steelers’ last two visits to Cleveland, both Browns victories.

“We understand the gravity of what we’re going into and how they engineer victory and who’s significant in doing so,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said last week. “(Garrett) is at the doorstep of history, and so we certainly have respect for that.”

Garrett is a four-time first-team All-Pro and was the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year, but he’s never won a sack title. With two games remaining, he’s seven sacks clear of the nearest pursuer, the New York Giants’ Brian Burns (15). Garrett broke his previous career high and franchise single-season record of 16 (2021 and 2022) in November.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/27165940/GettyImages-2253013843-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-28 09:58:21.437718

Hollins, 6-foot-4, 221 pounds, was coming off a seven-catch, 69-yard performance in last Sunday's win over the Baltimore Ravens that clinched a playoff berth for New England (12-3).
This season, Hollins has played 68% of the Patriots' offensive snaps, which is more than any receiver.
They also elevated defensive tackle Leonard Taylor III and cornerback Kobee Minor from the practice squad for Sunday's game.

Hollins hadn't practiced all week after landing on the injury report because of his abdomen. Hollins, 6-foot-4, 221 pounds, was coming off a seven-catch, 69-yard performance in last Sunday's win over the Baltimore Ravens that clinched a playoff berth for New England (12-3). He presumably was injured in the game at some point, although he didn't leave the game early and played 49 of a possible 74 snaps.

This season, Hollins has played 68% of the Patriots' offensive snaps, which is more than any receiver. His size and catch radius (especially on deep crossing routes) have helped quarterback Drake Maye complete a league-leading 70.9% of his passes (minimum 150 attempts). The Patriots also relied on Hollins to bring a physical edge in the running game.

On Friday, coach Mike Vrabel lauded the 32-year-old Hollins, who has generated headlines for his preference to arrive to games barefoot, for his team-first approach.

""He has an energy to him,"" Vrabel said. ""And seeing him on Sunday night with the passion he had to help us win; we'll obviously miss him. I've always appreciated his willingness to learn what we're doing but also be a leader for some of the younger guys.""

The Patriots don't have another receiver on their roster with Hollins' physical makeup. Veteran receiver Stefon Diggs leads the team with 76 catches for 869 yards. Third-year players Kayshon Boutte (inactive Sunday because of a concussion) and DeMario Douglas and rookies Kyle Williams and Efton Chism III round out the receiver depth chart.

Hollins must miss at least four games, which means he wouldn't be eligible to play until deep in the postseason, if at all. The Patriots visit the New York Jets on Sunday, then finish the regular season at home against the Miami Dolphins.

If the Patriots win their final two games, and the Denver Broncos lose their season finale at home against the Los Angeles Chargers, New England would earn the AFC's No. 1 seed.

The Patriots signed defensive tackle Jeremiah Pharms Jr. from the practice squad to the 53-man roster to fill Hollins' place on the roster. They also elevated defensive tackle Leonard Taylor III and cornerback Kobee Minor from the practice squad for Sunday's game.

In a related note, rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson has been cleared from the concussion protocol, the Patriots announced. Henderson is listed as questionable, and he made the trip with the team for Sunday's game. The Patriots didn't elevate a running back from the practice squad, a move that seems to indicate Henderson will return to action Sunday.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1227%2Fr1594156_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 08:57:58.390214

Booker flew into the backfield and drilled Love directly in the helmet as he brought him down for a sack in the second quarter of that contest at Soldier Field. He was immediately penalized for the hit.

Love remained down after the hit and eventually walked off into the blue medical tent. He didn't return, and was replaced by Malik Willis. Love is still in concussion protocol and has been ruled out of Saturday night’s game against the Baltimore Ravens.

Willis went 9-of-11 for 121 yards with a touchdown in Love’s absence against the Bears, though Chicago rallied from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter to grab the win in overtime. That extended the Bears' lead in the NFC North. They’ll win the division if the Ravens beat the Packers on Saturday night, which will secure the team’s first division title since 2018.

The Packers, who will wrap up the season with the Minnesota Vikings next week, can still win the NFC North. They'll have to be perfect the rest of the way, however, and the Bears will have to lose out.

But the Raiders did for Crosby, their best defensive player, what they did for Bowers, their best offensive player, who didn't need surgery on his bruised knee.","Las Vegas Raiders star Maxx Crosby is expected to need knee surgery that would sideline him into the offseason, league sources told ESPN.

The Raiders are placing Crosby on injured reserve to begin the process of getting him healthy for 2026.

Crosby was shut down during a week in which the Raiders already placed Pro Bowl tight end Brock Bowers on injured reserve -- and the same week Las Vegas plays the New York Giants in a game that could decide who gets the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL draft.

Some around the league speculated that competitive balance could be the impetus for these decisions, but the Raiders have stated that the moves are rooted solely in medical purposes.

""We have made the decision to place Maxx Crosby on the Reserve/Injured list for the remainder of the 2025 season,"" the team said in a statement Saturday. ""After deliberate and thorough consultation with multiple top medical professionals, it became clear that this decision is in the best interest of both the franchise and the player. Maxx is the ultimate warrior, and he has fought extremely hard to compete each week with his teammates since injuring his knee mid-season. We are grateful for his extraordinary contributions. He is a true Raider on and off the field -- we look forward to his leadership and toughness into 2026 and beyond.""

Crosby initially injured his left knee Oct. 19 at Kansas City and has rarely participated in a full week of practice since. On Tuesday, Crosby underwent an additional MRI that revealed the injury had persisted and could present long-term concerns should it not be addressed.

The Raiders shared those concerns with Crosby on Tuesday, along with the belief that the potential long-term risk was not prudent.

""Each week, he has done everything you could possibly imagine a guy could do to play, and he's been able to,"" Raiders coach Pete Carroll said Friday. ""But after an evaluation we did Monday or Tuesday, whenever it was, it just looks too bad.""

Crosby wanted to finish out the season because it is what makes him the high-energy, high-performance player that he is. When the Raiders overruled him, Crosby went home Friday, disappointed and upset, but Carroll told reporters that he and Crosby had spoken ""four times"" that day.

""He knows that he's banged up, so he's talking about, 'I'd like to get out of here.' And I said, 'Yeah, get out of here.' So he took off,"" Carroll said. ""... This didn't just spring on him. We've been talking about it, and it was exactly what you would think he would do and he should do. I agree with him 1,000 percent on how he responded, and I [would have] responded the same way.""

This marks the second straight year that Crosby did not finish the season -- last year he suffered a high ankle sprain that required surgery -- and Crosby does not like missing time.

But the Raiders did for Crosby, their best defensive player, what they did for Bowers, their best offensive player, who didn't need surgery on his bruised knee. Bowers has been playing with a PCL injury and bone bruise in his left knee since Week 1.

There are no plans for the Raiders to shut down any other players; the rest are healthy enough to play and are expected to do so Sunday against the Giants. Quarterback Geno Smith, running back Ashton Jeanty and wide receiver Tre Tucker will play Sunday, according to sources, as the Raiders play in a game that -- even if they don't want to admit it -- would be winning for losing.

The loser of the Giants-Raiders game will have the inside track on the No. 1 pick in next year's draft. The winner will be thrust into the mix of a group of teams with three wins and could fall out of the top five picks.

When Crosby was asked earlier in the week about the Raiders potentially securing the top pick in the draft, he said, ""I don't give a s--- about the pick. I don't play for that.

""My job is to be the best defensive end in the world, and that's what I focus on every day, and being a great leader and being an influence,"" Crosby said. ""That's [the front office's] job. But that's got nothing to do with me.""

The Raiders felt it was most important to protect their two greatest contributors, Crosby and Bowers, leading them to make the decisions they did.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F0414%2Fr1478704_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-28 06:57:39.265314

Kamal Hadden is in his second season with the Packers.

He was a sixth-round draft pick by the Kansas City Chiefs in 2024 but he was cut at the end of training camp.

The Packers signed Hadden before the start of the 2024 season and he spent the majority of the season on the practice squad.

Riley is now joining those players on the injured list and his season is likely over.

He departed Saturday's 41-24 loss to the Baltimore Ravens early in the second quarter after going down with an Achilles injury. The 338-pound Riley needed assistance in getting to his feet and onto a cart.

Riley, 27, was then taken to the locker room and the Packers ruled him out.

The injury came as Derrick Henry ran in for his second rushing touchdown of the game to put the Ravens ahead 14-7.

The Packers signed Riley off the New York Giants' practice squad on Dec. 3 less than a week after defensive lineman Devonte Wyatt suffered a season-ending ankle injury in a win over the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving.

The defensive line would suffer its biggest blow as week later with the loss of All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons, who tore his ACL against the Denver Broncos on Dec. 14.

It's also the second straight week that the Packers have lost a player to an Achilles injury. Tight end John FitzPatrick suffered a torn Achilles in the team's 22-16 loss to the Chicago Bears.

The two-time All-Pro tight end is currently dealing with an ankle injury, which he sustained in Monday’s 48-27 win over the Indianapolis Colts.

Kittle was forced to exit the game in the third quarter and was unable to return. After the win, the seven-time Pro Bowler claimed that it was a hip-drop tackle in the second quarter that caused his injury. The league has now reviewed the incidents from the 49ers-Colts game and has decided not to issue any fines against Indianapolis.

After being diagnosed with a low-to-mid-grade left ankle sprain, Kittle was forced to sit out all three practice sessions this week. He has officially been listed as questionable to play on Sunday against the Bears.

Kittle did not name any names when he stated after the Colts game that he was illegally taken down by a hip-drop tackle, which is defined in the NFL rule book as a defensive player grabbing “the runner with one or both hands or wraps the runner with both arms and unweights himself by swiveling and dropping his hips and/or lower body, landing on and/or trapping the runner’s leg(s) at or below the knee.”

The NFL Officiating Department reviews every play from every game. They looked at the tackles from the 49ers-Colts contest, but did not see any violations from Indianapolis, despite Kittle’s claim.

The league announced on Saturday via the gameday accountability report that no Colts player was fined for the Niners game. For context, hip-drop tackles are eligible for a fine of $17,389 for a first offense and $23,186 for a second.

While this is a positive development for the Colts, the bad news is that they have now officially been eliminated from playoff contention. The Houston Texans defeated the Los Angeles Chargers on Saturday, 20-16, resulting in Indianapolis losing its chance to secure a postseason berth.

As for Kittle, his status for the Bears game will likely be decided closer to kickoff. The Niners will host Chicago on Sunday, with the game scheduled to start at 8:20 p.m. from Levi’s Stadium.

Key offensive weapons such as Patriots running back TreVeyon Henderson and 49ers tight end George Kittle are trying to play through injury. Defensive stalwarts such as the Eagles' Jalen Carter and the Colts' Sauce Gardner will make their returns.

Here's who's in and who's out in Week 17.

QB Josh Allen (Bills)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Full

Injury: Foot

Kickoff: 4:25 p.m. ET

Allen will play in the Bills' Week 17 game against the Eagles. He sustained a foot injury in Buffalo's win over the Browns last week, but won't miss any time. With their superstar quarterback in the lineup, the Bills (11-4) will look to close the gap on the Patriots (12-3) in the AFC East.

RB TreVeyon Henderson (Patriots)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Full

Injury: Concussion

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Henderson sustained a concussion in the Patriots' Week 16 win over the Ravens on Sunday night. He missed the remainder of that game after getting hurt, but won't miss any more time as he progressed through the NFL's protocol, and was cleared to play. The Patriots can clinch the AFC East with a victory over the Jets and Bills loss to the Eagles.

WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (Cardinals)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Heel

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Harrison will play in the Cardinals' Week 17 game against the Bengals. He returned to the lineup last week after missing two games with a heel injury, but he's seemingly still hampered by it as he practiced in limited fashion throughout the week.

TE Harold Fannin Jr. (Browns)

Practice schedule: Full-Full-Limited

Injury: Groin

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Fannin plans to play in the Browns' Week 17 game against the Steelers after sustaining a groin injury during Friday's practice. It's unfortunate timing for the tight end who broke the franchise record for most receptions by a rookie in Week 16. He has 70 catches for 710 yards and five touchdowns in his first NFL season. He'll tough it out on Sunday.

DL Jalen Carter (Eagles)

Practice schedule: Full-Full-Full

Injury: Shoulder

Kickoff: 4:25 p.m. ET

Carter will return to the lineup for the Eagles' Week 17 game against the Bills. He's missed the last three games with a shoulder injury, and in that time, Philadelphia went 1-2. With their star defensive lineman back in the lineup, the Eagles will look to push for the NFC's two-seed with a win over the Bills. The Eagles also need a loss from the Bears in their game against the 49ers. Having Carter back will certainly help them achieve that first step.

CB Sauce Gardner (Colts)

Practice schedule: DNP-Limited-Full

Injury: Calf

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

Gardner will play for in the Colts' Week 17 game against the Jaguars. He sustained a calf injury in Week 13, and missed three games, two of which Indianapolis has lost. The Colts traded two future first-round draft picks for Gardner at the NFL's trade deadline, and now he can help them make one last push for the playoffs. Indianapolis needs to beat Jacksonville, and the Chargers need to beat the Texans to keep its playoff hopes alive.

DL DeForest Buckner (Colts)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Neck

Kickoff: 1 p.m. ET

DeForest Buckner will miss the Colts' Week 17 game against the Jaguars, and will miss the remainder of the season after being placed on injured reserve. Buckner was out five games with this same neck injury, and returned for Week 16 and reaggravated it. So while the Colts will get Gardner back in a must-win game, they'll lose their best defensive lineman, in Buckner.

TE George Kittle (49ers)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Ankle

Kickoff: 8:20 p.m. ET

Kittle will be a game-time decision for the 49ers' game against the Bears on Sunday night. He sustained an ankle injury in the 49ers' Monday night game against the Colts last week. While San Francisco has clinched a playoff spot, it can still earn the top-seed in the NFC if it wins its final two games against the Bears and the Seahawks. Therefore, Kittle may push to play, and help his team earn a week off down the line.

WR Luther Burden III (Bears)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limted-Full

Injury: Ankle

Kickoff: 8:20 p.m. ET

Burden will play in the Bears' game against the 49ers on Sunday night. The rookie wide receiver missed their game against the Packers last week with an ankle injury he sustained in Week 15. Now that he's back, he'll play a major role as lead pass-catcher Rome Odunze will miss his fourth straight game.",https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2025/12/1408/814/jalen_carter_horizontal.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-12-28 02:58:14.634483

The signal caller turned down entering the 2025 NFL Draft last year to return to Baton Rouge to continue his pursuit of leading the Tigers back to the national championship game. That did not happen as he's played through injury most of the season and LSU (7-5) will meet Houston (9-3) in the Texas Bowl inside NRG Stadium Saturday night (8:15 p.m. CT, ESPN).

Due to an abdominal strain that he initially suffered during preseason practice back in August, Nussmeier missed the final three regular season games for the Tigers. In the last game he played in at Alabama, Nussmeier was benched in the third quarter for sophomore backup Michael Van Buren, who has started in his place since reaggravating the abdominal injury ahead of the Arkansas game.

In nine-plus games, Nussmeier has thrown for 1,927 yards, 12 touchdowns and five interceptions in 2025. The LSU quarterback's numbers are a far cry from his performance as a first-time start his junior year when he put up more than 4,000 passing yards and 29 touchdowns in 2024.

Is Garrett Nussmeier playing today?

Nussmeier will not play against Houston in the Texas Bowl today. Interim LSU coach Frank Wilson told reporters multiple weeks before the game that Nussmeier had already been ruled out for the contest.

Missing the Texas Bowl will allow Nussmeier a jumpstart in getting ready for the NFL Draft process, which officially kicks off early 2026.

The 27-year-old quarterback was ruled out for the game due to a concussion, which he sustained in the Packers’ 22-16 overtime loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday.

Love, who went 8 of 13 passing for 77 yards before his early exit, suffered the head injury when he took a hit from Chicago defensive end Austin Booker. Initially after the second quarter incident, Love's return was questionable. Eventually he was ruled out for the remainder of the contest.

Booker's helmet-to-helmet hit temporarily produced a 7-yard loss, but the play was nullified by the personal foul penalty assessed to the defensive end. The Packers QB was down on the ground for a while before slowly getting to his feet and being assisted off the field. Booker was flagged for unnecessary roughness, resulting in a 15-yard penalty against the Bears.

The NFL has reviewed the incident and reached a decision on Booker’s actions. The league announced on Saturday via the game day accountability report that the Chicago DE had been fined $5,818 for a hit on the quarterback. Booker’s tackle was deemed excessive by the NFL officiating department, and he has been punished for a blow to the head/neck.

This is Booker’s second fine this season. In November, the second-year player was fined $5,818 for impermissible use of the helmet against the New York Giants.

As for Love, the Packers star was limited at practice throughout the week. There was hope he would be able to suit up on Saturday against Baltimore, but the nature of his injury forced Green Bay to sit him instead.

Love’s next chance to play will be in Week 18 against the Minnesota Vikings. The Bears, on the other hand, are in action on Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers. Both the Packers and the Bears have clinched playoff berths.

“We’ve put our emphasis on faster, quicker, more powerful,” said Scotty Smith, Performance Coach and Owner of Synergy Sports Performance in Green Bay.

Across the league, a bigger question keeps surfacing: Why are today’s best-conditioned athletes still getting hurt?

WATCH THE WHOLE BROADCAST STORY HERE:

NFL's injury era: Why are so many players getting hurt?

“It was a freak accident … non-contact. My knee just caved in and just tore my ACL,” said Derrek Bunkleman, a Drake University linebacker and De Pere High School alumnus.

Before his college football career even began, Bunkleman tore his ACL while still at De Pere High School.

“I was devastated,” Bunkleman said. “I was like, ‘How am I gonna come back from this?’”

In today’s professional athletes, experts say, we don’t have a toughness problem... It’s a physics problem.

“We’ve put our emphasis on faster, quicker, more powerful,” said Scotty Smith, Performance Coach and Owner of Synergy Sports Performance in Green Bay. “But how do we control those things? So I’ve always used that explanation of like we put the bigger engine in a nice car, but we don’t address the tires and the brakes.”

And when that car has to stop, something has to give.

As athletes get bigger and faster, non-contact injuries have become more common, according to the National Academy of Sports Medicine.

“In a non-contact ACL injury, the foot is planted, there’s no contact,” said Dr. Abbey DeBruin, an orthopedic surgeon at OSMS Green Bay. “The tibia shifts forward on the femur. That pivoting motion puts strain on the ACL. In some cases, the force and the strain overcome what the ACL is able to endure, and that’s when an ACL rupture can happen.”

That’s why experts say injury prevention today is more than just fixing what’s broken. It’s about managing workload and recovery.

“These guys aren’t getting the one-on-one attention you think that they are,” Smith said. “There’s just not enough people to go around.”

And even when injuries are repaired, timing matters.

“With an ACL reconstruction, the graft somewhere around the three to four month mark is probably actually at its weakest point,” Dr. DeBruin said.

Athletes are starting to feel a lot better and want to potentially be more involved in sport, but the graft is at a more vulnerable point for re-rupture. Dr. DeBruin says that oftentimes it’s 9 months or more before athletes are recovered enough to return to peak performance.

As the NFL looks for its next edge, Dr. DeBruin and Smith say the teams that rethink how they protect their athletes may shape the future of the game.

“We grew up in this world that we think more is better,” Smith said. “And I’m always under the assumption that more isn’t better. Better is better.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7643552/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2918x1532+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F44%2F9d%2F0451387149e996bdb300dfce74be%2Fap25348858864919.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 22:57:54.547750

The Patriots' resurgence in coach Mike Vrabel's first season at the helm comes thanks to improvement on both sides of the ball. New England's defense was well below average in 2024; a year later, it's a top-10 unit by yards and points allowed.

New England's offense took a bigger jump under Vrabel and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels. Second-year quarterback Drake Maye's led that side of the ball from one of the worst in the league to a top-10 unit as well.

Maye's top weapon this year has been rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson. New England selected Henderson in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft and he's grown into a big role in the offense.

Henderson leads the team in scrimmage yards (997) and touchdowns (eight) this season. He left New England's Week 16 game against the Baltimore Ravens during the second quarter with a concussion.

Will Henderson be back for the Patriots' Week 17 matchup against the New York Jets? Here's what we know:

Is TreVeyon Henderson playing this week?

Henderson cleared concussion protocol and is expected to play against the Jets this week, per multiple reports.

Henderson was a full-go in practice on Friday, per the team's injury report.

New England's used a mixture of Henderson and veteran Rhamondre Stevenson out of the backfield this season. Henderson holds the edge in carries (148 to Stevenson's 115), rushing yards (776 to 425) and rushing touchdowns (seven to four). After practicing fully, that's a good sign he'll be the top runner once again.

The Patriots will be without two key weapons, Mack Hollins and Kayshon Boutte, but having Henderson will help soften the blow. Henderson exited the game against the Baltimore Ravens early, logging just 14 snaps. However, he has been a great player for the Patriots this season.

The 2025 second-round pick broke out when Rhamondre Stevenson was injured and has carved out a role for himself on the offense. Henderson has 776 rushing yards this season and 221 receiving yards. He has a total of eight touchdowns this season.

Four of his touchdowns have been from at least 50 yards out. He is a big play waiting to happen, and having him back on the field is a great boost for the Patriots. The team will be missing five starters in total, so Mike Vrabel will need everyone else to step up.

The Baltimore Ravens have a massive problem with quarterback Lamar Jackson ahead of the Week 17 game against the Green Bay Packers.

Jackson suffered a back injury in the Week 16 loss to the New England Patriots that forced his early exit from the contest and led to his being on the injury report this week.

After not practicing at all during the week, Jackson drew the dreaded doubtful tag on Thursday, which is terrible news for his chances of suiting up.

Here's what we know about Jackson's status for Week 17.

Is Lamar Jackson playing tonight?

UPDATE: Jackson is officially INACTIVE for Week 17.

No, Jackson is not expected to play on Saturday against the Packers.

Players rarely play through the doubtful tag, so while the light is still on for the Ravens quarterback just in case, he's highly unlikely to suit up.

The last time we saw a player be active despite the doubtful tag was Las Vegas Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby, who played in Week 12 of the 2023 season against the Kansas City Chiefs after being listed with the designation.

We'll get final confirmation on Jackson's status an hour and a half before the 8 p.m. ET kickoff on Saturday, when the Ravens and Packers drop their lists of inactives.

Barring Jackson pulling off a rare feat, the Ravens' playoff hopes are riding on the arm of backup quarterback Tyler Huntley, who won his only start this season, which came in Week 8 against the Chicago Bears.

Huntley completed 17-of-22 passes for 186 yards and one touchdown while adding eight carries for 53 yards in the victory over the Bears. In all, Huntley is 6-9 as a starter during his career.

Upon replacing an injured Jackson last week, Huntley completed 9-of-10 passes for 65 yards in the 28-24 loss. The Ravens actually had a two-score lead in the fourth quarter of that game before a total collapse on both sides of the ball.

While Huntley is an obvious downgrade from Jackson, it's not impossible to think the Ravens can win another game with him under center.

Increasing their chances is the fact that the Packers won't have starter Jordan Love under center, as he has been ruled out for the contest. However, backup signal-caller Malik Willis is very capable of leading Green Bay to a win.

Baltimore enters this contest in a do-or-die situation.

If the Ravens lose, they will be eliminated from playoff contention, sending the team into an offseason with a ton of uncertainty. If the Ravens win, they will need the Pittsburgh Steelers to lose on Sunday to the Cleveland Browns to stay alive.

Here's what to know about Lamar Jackson's status for the Ravens' Week 17 game and beyond as they look to remain in the 2025 AFC playoff race.

Is Lamar Jackson playing today?

Jackson is officially inactive for Saturday's game against the Packers. The Ravens had initially designated him as ""doubtful"" to play on the team's final injury report for Week 17.

While Jackson wasn't immediately ruled out for the contest, the two-time MVP was unable to practice in the lead-up to Saturday's game. That set the expectation Huntley would start in his place.

Lamar Jackson injury update

Jackson is dealing with a back injury he suffered midway through his team's Week 16 loss to the New England Patriots.

Jackson wasn't able to return to the ""Sunday Night Football"" game after being kneed in the back while sliding to the ground after a 3-yard gain. Huntley finished the second half and Ravens coach John Harbaugh later told reporters Jackson had suffered a serious back contusion.

Harbaugh provided updates about Jackson's Week 17 status throughout the week. He told reporters Dec. 24 it was ""undetermined"" whether Jackson would play against the Packers and that the team would evaluate Jackson throughout the week before determining his status.

""He could play without that practice for sure,"" Harbaugh said of Jackson. ""He's played a lot of football, won a lot of games for us. If he's ready to go, he will go. If he can go, he will go. You can bet on that.""

But ultimately, Jackson wasn't able to practice because of the back injury and was slapped with the ""doubtful"" designation for Saturday's game. He was then declared inactive for the contest 90 minutes before it began.

Who is the Ravens' backup QB?

Tyler Huntley is the Ravens' backup. The 27-year-old is expected to start in place of Jackson against the Packers in what would be his second start of the 2025 campaign.

Huntley has completed 76.6% of his passes for 319 yards and one touchdown in his limited action with the Ravens this season. He helped lead the Ravens to a 30-16 win over the Chicago Bears in Week 8 in his lone start but has a career record of 6-9 in 15 starts.

Huntley has completed 65.7% of his career passes for 3,105 yards, 12 touchdowns and 10 interceptions.

Ravens QB depth chart

The Ravens have three quarterbacks on their 53-man roster. They are:

Lamar Jackson (injured)

Tyler Huntley

Cooper Rush

Rush started the 2025 NFL season as the Ravens' backup quarterback before being overtaken by Huntley. The 32-year-old struggled in two starts after replacing an injured Jackson earlier in the season, completing 65.4% of his passes for 303 yards and four interceptions.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/27/USAT/87929345007-lamar-jackson-ravens-122725.jpg?crop=4870,2739,x0,y15&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-27 20:00:15.634005

As the team announced on Saturday, the rookie running back has cleared the NFL’s concussion protocol and will play against the New York Jets on Sunday.

Henderson, 23, was one of three Patriots entering the protocol after sustaining a head injury last Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens. The second-round draft pick went down midway through the second quarter and subsequently had to exit the game.

Unlike wide receiver Kayshon Boutte and left guard Jared Wilson, Henderson was back at practice at the first possible opportunity. While still limited in his return, he was upgraded to full participation by Friday’s session and subsequently listed as questionable for the game against the Jets.

Since then, he passed the final examination conducted by an independent doctor and was given the green light to play on Sunday. This means that, unlike their first meeting Week 11, both Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson will suit up versus New York at the running back position. Stevenson had missed the previous game with a toe injury.

In his abence, Henderson finished with three total touchdowns in a 27-14 Patriots victory at Gillette Stadium. In total, the youngster has found the end zone a team-leading eight times this season while also gaining 997 yards from scrimmage.

In addition to the Henderson announcement, the Patriots also changed the status of fullback Jack Westover for Sunday’s game. Dealing with an illness, Westover is officially questionable.

This Week 17 matchup between the Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers will feature two playoff teams with 11-4 records. Both can clinch the No. 1 seed in the conference if they win out and have the Seattle Seahawks (12-4) lose a game.

After the 49ers, the Bears will close out their regular season against the Detroit Lions at Soldier Field. The 49ers will host the Seahawks at Levi’s Stadium in Week 18.

That final game against the Lions won’t matter if the Bears don’t come away with a win against the 49ers on Sunday Night Football.

Here are the five players who will have a major influence on the Week 17 matchup in Santa Clara, CA.

BEARS LB Tremaine Edmunds

The Bears’ linebacker made his return against the Green Bay Packers after missing four games with a groin injury. In the 22-16 win over the Packers, Edmunds finished with six total tackles and recovered a fumble caused by Nashon Wright deep in the third quarter.

With how 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan runs his offense, Edmunds will have plenty to decipher, given the numerous presnap motions, shifts, and misdirections that occur on any given snap.

Edmunds needs to trust his eyes and instincts so he can play fast against a well-coached 49ers offense that hasn’t punted since the team’s Week 13 matchup against the Cleveland Browns on Nov. 30.

Bears DL Gervon Dexter Sr.

The Bears’ defensive lineman has had a quiet stretch of games since the Week 12 game against the Minnesota Vikings. Dexter has just one sack in the last six games and has five total on the season, which is tied for his career high.

However, Dexter does have 13 total quarterback pressures in his last four games, but he needs to find a way to turn those plays into sacks, especially against 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy.

According to Next Gen Stats, Purdy has an NFL-leading 130.0 passer rating on third downs this season. Dexter will have to prove he can help limit the 49ers’ production on first and second down to make those third-down situations tougher for Purdy to convert.

Bears WR Luther Burden III

After missing last week’s game against the Packers with an ankle injury, Burden is positioned to return for Sunday night’s game versus the 49ers. He was a full participant in Friday’s practice and had no injury designation.

[READ: Bears injury report: Luther Burden III will play 49ers, Rome Odunze remains out]

The Bears’ rookie wide receiver was the team’s leading receiver in the 31-3 win over the Cleveland Browns. He caught six passes on seven targets for 84 yards.

The 49ers have struggled to apply pressure all season, generating just 18 total sacks, which is last in the NFL. According to Next Gen Stats, the 49ers have three of the 10 defensive tackles with the lowest pressure rate generated this season (minimum 200 pass rushes) in Kalia Davis, Jordan Elliott and Alfred Collins.

With the 49ers’ inability to create consistent pressure, this should allow Caleb Williams to find receivers downfield, and Burden could be in for a big receiving day.

49ers RB Christian McCaffrey

This 49ers’ offense runs through McCaffrey, and that’s not an exaggeration.

The veteran running back leads the team in rushing and receiving. He has 280 carries for 1,039 yards and nine touchdowns, and has 92 receptions for 849 yards and seven touchdowns.

According to Next Gen Stats, McCaffrey leads the NFL with 372 touches, 43 more than any other player.

Shanahan will find different ways to get his best playmaker the ball, and it will take all 11 players on defense to help contain one of the NFL’s most versatile players.

49ers LB Dee Winters

The former sixth-round draft pick from TCU in 2023 is having a career season.

Winters leads the 49ers with 92 total tackles, which is 16 more than fellow linebacker Tatum Bethune.

The 25-year-old linebacker made arguably his biggest play of the season in the Monday night victory over the Indianapolis Colts in Week 16. The 49ers were up 41-27 late in the fourth quarter, and then Winters extended the lead after he intercepted Philip Rivers and returned the interception 74 yards for a pick-6 to help San Francisco win 48-27.

Bears head coach Ben Johnson praised defensive coordinator Robert Saleh for how hard his unit plays. Winters is a good example of that defensive mentality, and the Bears’ offense will have to keep tabs on him throughout the game.",https://dupvhm5r1oaxt.cloudfront.net/uploads/2025/12/Untitled-design-17-1024x576.png,N,,2025-12-27 21:13:02.840615

1 overall pick in the NFL draft since taking running back Tucker Frederickson out of Auburn in 1965.br/]","EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- There is a lot at stake on Sunday for two 2-13 teams when the New York Giants and Las Vegas Raiders meet at Allegiant Stadium (4:05 p.m. ET, CBS). Namely, the pole position for the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL draft.

The Giants and Raiders currently have a 37.6% and 36.2% chance, respectively, to land the coveted top pick, according to ESPN Analytics. The Giants would be comfortably in the driver's seat heading into Week 18's matchup with Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys if they lose in Las Vegas. Ditto the Raiders with the Kansas City Chiefs on the horizon for their finale.

New York's odds jump to 73% to get the top pick with a loss to the Raiders. They fall to 6% with a win. Conversely, the Raiders jump to 69% with a loss and less than 1% with a win.

This is all possible because the Giants and Raiders come in on nine-game losing streaks. It's the first time in NFL history that two teams with at least nine-game skids during a single season meet, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.

But clearly a lot is at stake for both teams aside from ending their losing streaks, even if those involved don't want to look at it that way.

""I mean, I really don't think we talk about that part too much about the draft positioning and wanting a certain pick or anything like that,"" Giants wide receiver Wan'Dale Robinson said. ""I think we just want to go out there and play our best football and go out there and get a win.""

For the Giants, a win could mean preventing them from getting a significant haul in a trade for the top pick, presumably from a team that desperately needs a quarterback. Or they could just stay at No. 1 and selecta top-rated player without any hesitation or obstruction.

For the Raiders, a loss could mean having their choice at the top quarterback in this year's draft, whomever they decide that might be -- likely Indiana's Fernando Mendoza or Oregon's Dante Moore, should he declare for the draft. That could prove valuable with35-year-old starter (and former Giant) Geno Smith.

Either way, it's not hard to see why this game between two struggling teams is so valuable. So while the loser can technically be the winner, it's not something that Giants interim coach Mike Kafka has even mentioned to his team this week.

""I haven't talked about it with the players. The players want to win. The coaching staff wants to win this week,"" Kafka said. ""Like, this is our only focus is this week. And so, all our messaging, all that we're talking about is how we can get better, number one, as a team, and then what we have to do today to go out there to Vegas and beat the Raiders.""

Tell that to each team's fan base. The focus publicly is primarily on what this game means in terms of draft positioning.

The Giants ruled out left tackle Andrew Thomas on Friday with a hamstring injury and center John Michael Schmitz Jr. is doubtful with a finger problem that inhibits his ability to snap.

Las Vegas placed tight end Brock Bowers and safety Jeremy Chinn on injured reserve earlier this week. Bowers has been dealing with a knee injury for a good chunk of this season but finished Sunday's loss to the Houston Texans. Chinn also landed on IR after playing all 61 defensive snaps against the Houston Texans.

But don't tell Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby about positioning for any draft pick.

""Yeah, I don't give a s--- about the pick, to be honest. I don't play for that. That's not my job,"" Crosby said after the 23-21 loss to the Texans. ""My job is to be the best defensive end in the world. That's what I focus on every day. And being a great leader, being an influence, being that guy on a consistent basis for my team.

""That's their job, the front office, the coaches. They do that. But that has nothing to do with me. I've learned that lesson in the past. I'm not trying to ... you can't control everything. That's not my job description. My job is to be the best in the world at what I do. That is wrecking the game.""

The Raiders ultimately shut down Crosby, much to his chagrin. He was ruled out for Sunday because of a lingering knee problem that he wanted to play through.

Worrying about the draft is not Crosby's responsibility, yet it can also be fruitless.

The Giants played against Washington late in the 2019 season in what has famously been dubbed ""The Chase Young Bowl."" The loser of that game was supposed to have the prime position to draft former Ohio State standout Chase Young.

New York won behind five touchdown passes by Daniel Jones. The Commanders ended up taking Young second overall in that 2020 draft. The Giants, perhaps fortuitously, ended up with standout left tackle Andrew Thomas.

Unfortunately New York has been in this situation often in recent years.The Giants won in Week 17 last year against the Colts to take them out of the running for the No. 1 overall pick. The Tennessee Titans ultimately selected quarterback Cam Ward with the top pick while the Giants took edge rusher Abdul Carter third overall and had to trade back into the bottom half of the first round for quarterback Jaxson Dart.

The Giants also won three straight games late in the 2023 season with Tommy DeVito at quarterback to take them out of the running for quarterbacks Caleb Williams, Jayden Daniels and Drake Maye. They were selected by Chicago, Washington and New England, respectively, while New York remained at No. 6 and landed star wide receiver Malik Nabers.

The Las Vegas Raiders placed their star defensive end on injured reserve on Saturday, officially ending his season due to a knee injury. The team decided to shut down the five-time Pro Bowler ""with Crosby's best interest in mind,"" even as Crosby wanted to be on the field.

Crosby is expected to undergo knee surgery in the near future that will sideline him into the offseason, too, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Further specifics on that surgery, or a timeline for his return, are not yet known.

While the Raiders may want to not risk further injury for Crosby, they are also chasing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. In facing a fellow 2-13 team in the New York Giants on Sunday, a defeat would improve their chances and not having their best defensive player would aid in that pursuit.

According to the NFL, this will be only the third time in NFL history that two teams that are 11-plus games under .500 will meet and the first time since 1991.

The 27-year-old Crosby was vocal earlier this week about caring more about helping the Raiders win rather than about a first overall draft pick.

""Yeah, I don’t give a s*** about the pick, to be honest,"" Crosby said Tuesday. ""I don't play for that. That's not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world. That's what I focus on every day. Being a great leader, being an influence. Being that guy on a consistent basis for my team.""

After being informed that the Raiders weren't going to let him play against the Giants, Crosby told head coach Pete Carroll that he wanted to leave the facility.

""He knows that he's banged up, so he's talking about, 'I'd like to get out of here.' And I said, 'Yeah, get out of here.' So he took off,"" Carroll said on Friday, via ESPN. ""... This didn't just spring on him. We've been talking about it, and it was exactly what you would think he would do and he should do. I agree with him 1,000 percent on how he responded, and I [would have] responded the same way.""

Crosby has been in the NFL since 2019 and has played 110 regular-season games with the Raiders, but only one playoff game. The Raiders have only two playoff appearances — and zero playoff wins — since appearing in Super Bowl XXXVII at the end of the 2002 season.

Crosby won't be the only Raiders star who will miss out this weekend. Tight end Brock Bowers was placed on injured reserve Wednesday with a knee injury that limited him to 12 games this season.

Bowers, the Raiders 2024 first-round draft pick, was an All-Pro last season and has made two Pro Bowls in his first two NFL seasons. After recording 112 catches for 1,194 yards and five touchdowns in 2024, the injury affected his output this season as he'll finish with 680 receiving yards, with 64 receptions and seven touchdowns.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WRQx0owiYDrCUPzECyPfjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/f7728090-e29b-11f0-bbfc-dfdd2315ff26,N,,2025-12-27 19:00:43.942711

Dart was miserable in Week 16 against Minnesota, but I expect him to bounce back in Week 17 at Las Vegas. Dart is once again worth using as a low-end starter in all leagues. The Vikings have dominated all their opposing quarterbacks since Week 9, so it was no surprise that Dart was miserable with 7-of-13 passing for 33 yards and an interception, and he only ran for 7 yards. This week, Dart should rebound against the Raiders, who have allowed seven quarterbacks to score at least 21.2 Fantasy points this season. And Dart is averaging 23.5 Fantasy points in five road games this year. It also helps that Maxx Crosby isn't expected to play for Las Vegas in Week 17.

He just had his first 300-yard game in Week 16 against the Jets (308), and he has two games in his past three outings with at least 32 rushing yards. This week, Shough is facing a Titans defense that has allowed four of the past five opposing quarterbacks to score at least 21.7 Fantasy points, and the only team below that total was Kansas City in Week 16 without Patrick Mahomes (knee).

TreVeyon Henderson (concussion) is expected to play in Week 17, but I still like Stevenson as at least a flex option in all leagues against the Jets. In their past six games, seven running backs have scored at least 13.5 PPR points against New York with nine rushing touchdowns and five receiving touchdowns. Stevenson missed the Week 11 game against the Jets due to a toe injury, but Henderson had 19 carries for 62 yards and two touchdowns and five catches for 31 yards and a touchdown on five targets. Stevenson just scored 17.8 PPR points in Week 16 at Baltimore in the game Henderson was injured. Even though Henderson should be considered a No. 2 Fantasy running back in all leagues, Stevenson still played more snaps than him in the two games prior to Week 16, which gives him a good chance to also be productive in this fantastic matchup.

He played Week 1 without Judkins, and Sampson had 12 carries for 29 yards and eight catches for 64 yards on eight targets. His role in the passing game is what we like, and Shedeur Sanders likes throwing to his running backs. In five starts, Sanders has targeted his running backs 38 times for 31 catches, 297 yards and one touchdown. That reception total for running backs is third in the NFL over that span. Sampson is a high-end flex in PPR in this game.

All three Jaguars receivers are worth a look in this matchup, and I like Jakobi Meyers as a low-end No. 2 Fantasy receiver, with Parker Washington as a high-end No. 3 option.

Clemson football will be without 29 players in the Pinstripe Bowl.

Clemson (7-5) faces Penn State (6-6) on Dec. 27 (noon ET, ABC) at Yankee Stadium in New York.

Multiple Tigers players either opted out to transfer or focus on the 2026 NFL draft or are injured, including 11 starters. Clemson is going for its fifth straight win and 15th consecutive year with a postseason victory to extend the longest streak in FBS history, but these losses will make it difficult for coach Dabo Swinney.

Buy Clemson vs. Penn State tickets

""It's a long list, but nobody cares,"" Swinney said Dec. 15. ""It's next-man up, excited to see these guys step up and go play.""

Here's the full list of Tigers who won't play in the Pinstripe Bowl.

Is Antonio Williams playing today?

Clemson's star receiver won't play because of a shoulder injury. Williams announced he will enter the NFL draft after the Clemson-Furman game in November.

Williams has recorded 208 catches for 2,336 yards and 21 touchdowns over four years at Clemson. He is also 4-of-4 passing for 143 yards and two touchdowns in his career.

Why did Peter Woods opt out of Pinstripe Bowl?

Clemson's top defensive tackle is a projected top-10 pick in the NFL draft. This season, Woods logged a career-high 30 tackles, including two sacks, and one pass deflection. He earned first-team All-ACC honors and also rushed for 15 yards and two touchdowns on eight attempts in Clemson's jumbo package.

Woods recorded 84 tackles, including 14.5 for loss and five sacks, and forced two fumbles over 35 games and 24 starts in his career.

Why did Avieon Terrell opt out of Pinstripe Bowl?

Clemson's top cornerback is a projected first- or second-round pick in the NFL draft. Terrell recorded 48 tackles, including three sacks, five forced fumbles and nine pass deflections this season. He was first-team All-ACC and a Jim Thorpe award semifinalist, which is given to the nation's top defensive back.

Why did TJ Parker opt out of Pinstripe Bowl?

Clemson's top edge rusher is a projected first- or second-round pick in the NFL draft. Parker recorded 37 tackles, including five sacks, three fumble recoveries and one pass break up this season.

When does Clemson play Penn State ?

Clemson face Penn State on Dec. 27 (noon ET, ABC) at Yankee Stadium in New York.

Clemson vs. Penn State prediction

Clemson 30, Penn State 27: The Tigers will win their fifth straight game to build momentum for next season. Clemson will be down down key players, especially on defense, but the Tigers will overcome those losses in a high-scoring game.

Clemson will lean on the run game to gash the Nittany Lions on the ground. Quarterback Cade Klubnik will also lead a game-winning drive, and Clemson's defense will force a turnover in the final moments to win.

Meanwhile, offensive lineman Alaric Jackson (ankle) and Braden Fiske (ankle) are listed as questionable. McVay said it's ""more likely than not"" that Jackson and Fiske play, but also that ""it wouldn't be something that would be crazy if they weren't able to make it.""

Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall practiced for a third straight day this week and is tracking toward playing Sunday, per Matt Maiocco of NBC Sports Bay Area.

Pearsall entered the week listed with ankle and knee concerns. While he remains officially listed as questionable, his steady presence on the practice field suggests the 49ers are increasingly comfortable with how he’s responded physically as kickoff approaches.

He looks likely to return after missing the 49ers win over the Indianapolis Colts.

Why Pearsall’s Availability Matters for the 49ers

Pearsall’s importance goes beyond the usage.

When active, he adds flexibility to the 49er’s receiver rotation, helping maintain spacing and allowing the offense to stay versatile with personnel groupings. His presence reduces the need to overload snaps elsewhere and gives quarterback Brock Purdy another reliable option.

In his last outing against the Tennessee Titans, Pearsall had 6 receptions on 7 targets, for 96 yards.

The balance he brings will become more valuable late in the season, when defenses tighten windows and the margin for error narrows.

Additional Injury Context Entering Sunday Night

Pearsall is not the only player being monitored.

Tight end George Kittle remains a game-time decision as he continues to manage an ankle injury. The 49ers have taken a cautious approach with Kittle throughout the week, and his status is expected to be determined closer to kickoff.

If he’s unable to suit up, the 49ers could lean on Jake Tonges. The backup tight end was a key contributor in the first half of the season during Kittle’s absence.

On the defensive side, cornerback Renardo Green has been ruled out and will miss another game.

The Bigger Picture for the 49ers

The 49ers have already secured a playoff berth, but the final two weeks remain meaningful.

A win over the Chicago Bears would set up a regular-season finale against the Seattle Seahawks with division positioning and seeding still unresolved.

For now, Pearsall’s trajectory is encouraging. If it holds through the weekend, the 49ers may enter Sunday night with one fewer question mark, even as others remain unresolved.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2234518999-e1759412544451.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2025-12-27 20:01:20.107710

Crosby is expected to undergo knee surgery in the near future that will sideline him into the offseason, too, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Further specifics on that surgery, or a timeline for his return, are not yet known.

While the Raiders may want to not risk further injury for Crosby, they are also chasing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. In facing a fellow 2-13 team in the New York Giants on Sunday, a defeat would improve their chances and not having their best defensive player would aid in that pursuit.

According to the NFL, this will be only the third time in NFL history that two teams that are 11-plus games under .500 will meet and the first time since 1991.

The 27-year-old Crosby was vocal earlier this week about caring more about helping the Raiders win rather than about a first overall draft pick.

""Yeah, I don’t give a s*** about the pick, to be honest,"" Crosby said Tuesday. ""I don't play for that. That's not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world. That's what I focus on every day. Being a great leader, being an influence. Being that guy on a consistent basis for my team.""

After being informed that the Raiders weren't going to let him play against the Giants, Crosby told head coach Pete Carroll that he wanted to leave the facility.

""He knows that he's banged up, so he's talking about, 'I'd like to get out of here.' And I said, 'Yeah, get out of here.' So he took off,"" Carroll said on Friday, via ESPN. ""... This didn't just spring on him. We've been talking about it, and it was exactly what you would think he would do and he should do. I agree with him 1,000 percent on how he responded, and I [would have] responded the same way.""

Crosby has been in the NFL since 2019 and has played 110 regular-season games with the Raiders, but only one playoff game. The Raiders have only two playoff appearances — and zero playoff wins — since appearing in Super Bowl XXXVII at the end of the 2002 season.

Crosby won't be the only Raiders star who will miss out this weekend. Tight end Brock Bowers was placed on injured reserve Wednesday with a knee injury that limited him to 12 games this season.

Bowers, the Raiders 2024 first-round draft pick, was an All-Pro last season and has made two Pro Bowls in his first two NFL seasons.

These issues forced Arsenal to play with central midfielder Declan Rice at right-back and bring Myles Lewis-Skelly into the starting line-up minutes before kick-off.
“We have a lot of issues that we are dealing with,” Arteta said in his post-match news conference.
Something very awkward happened, and today in the warm-up, he wasn’t comfortable.” Heading into the game, Timber was Arsenal’s only fit right-back due to Ben White (hamstring) and Cristhian Mosquera (ankle) being unavailable.
“Yes (the injury issues are uniting the group).","Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta says injury issues are uniting his team after Riccardo Calafiori and Jurrien Timber were ruled out of their win against Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday.

Despite being in control for large periods of the game, the north London side edged a 2-1 victory at the Emirates Stadium to return to the top of the Premier League.

However, they did so without defenders Timber, who Arteta said “landed awkwardly” on Friday, and Calafiori who pulled out of the starting XI after aggravating an issue during the warm-up.

These issues forced Arsenal to play with central midfielder Declan Rice at right-back and bring Myles Lewis-Skelly into the starting line-up minutes before kick-off.

“We have a lot of issues that we are dealing with,” Arteta said in his post-match news conference. “Yesterday (Friday), we lost Jurrien and so today Declan has to play as a full-back.

“You see the performance that he (Rice) put in, so that’s the spirit and that’s how much our players want it.”

When asked about Calafiori’s issue, Arteta said: “It’s something that he felt yesterday. Something very awkward happened, and today in the warm-up, he wasn’t comfortable.”

Heading into the game, Timber was Arsenal’s only fit right-back due to Ben White (hamstring) and Cristhian Mosquera (ankle) being unavailable. Timber played the entirety of the League Cup quarter-final against Crystal Palace on Tuesday and took a penalty in the eventual shootout, as did Calafiori.

However, Arsenal did receive an injury boost before the game with centre-back Gabriel coming on as late substitute for his first appearance since November.

“Hopefully, things will get better and there has been good news as well. For example we’ve got we’ve got Gabriel earlier than expected, which is great,” Arteta continued.

“The staff have done an incredible job, the way he pushes himself as well, that’s what we need. Because we lost one, we’ve got somebody else back.

“Yes (the injury issues are uniting the group). There’s something with Richy (Calafiori), it was something as well, very, very strange. But, I spoke to Declan and told him he needs to play there as a right back, and he said ‘Okay, I’m up for a challenge, I’m going to do my best.’ That attitude is great to witness.”

This week, in his usual optimistic fashion, 49ers general manager John Lynch told KNBR Radio that a return to the field at some point this season is possible: ""I won't put anything past him.""

""I think it's a thing that will remain to be seen,"" Lynch told the radio station. ""But I know he's putting his heart and soul and his incredible work ethic to work every single day in an effort to do that.""

By that count, the earliest Warner could be back would be Super Bowl LX on Feb 8, and that's as aggressive as it gets.

That said, if Warner was able to get on the field in any form or fashion, it would be a boost. One of the game's best, Warner has also been the team's most durable, playing in every game since 2018 at an incredibly high level until his injury.

Warner has not yet weighed in on Lynch's prognostication, but he recently told The Ryen Russillo Show that his focus is on the road back.

""Everything happens for a reason,"" Warner said. ""God has a plan.

That means a likely battle of backup quarterbacks in a critical Week 17 game. Malik Willis, who has dealt with a right shoulder and illness this week, is expected to start for the Packers.

Willis played well in relief of Love last week in an overtime loss to the Chicago Bears, completing nine of 11 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown. This will be his sixth career start in four seasons.

Head Coach John Harbaugh said the Packers run the same offense with both quarterbacks, and that's how they've been preparing all week, not knowing who would be under center.

""Malik has done a great job. I think he's had a good year when he's played. He's very elusive back there. He throws a good ball. His timing and his mechanics have really looked good this year,"" Harbaugh said.

""So, he's obviously a very dangerous quarterback. He looked good in this last game when he played. So, we'll be very much very respectful of him or whoever's back there playing quarterback.""

Henderson was limited in practice on Wednesday and Thursday as he makes his way through concussion protocol.
That is a very promising sign for his status in Week 17 against the Jets.","Thanks to the Denver Broncos holding on for a win over Kansas City on Christmas, the New England Patriots need a win over the New York Jets in Week 17 to still have a chance at the No. 1 seed in the AFC.

New England's 10-game winning streak came to an end in Week 15 with a 35-31 loss to the Buffalo Bills. They responded with a win over the Baltimore Ravens in prime time last week to keep pace with the Broncos atop the AFC.

The Patriots won their first matchup with the Jets: a 27-14 victory on ""Thursday Night Football"" in Week 11. New England's win came thanks to three touchdowns from electric rookie running back TreVeyon Henderson.

Henderson, the team's second-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft out of Ohio State, leads the Patriots in scrimmage yards (997) and touchdowns (eight) through 16 games. This comes even after he missed most of the Patriots' win over the Ravens due to a concussion.

Will Henderson play in Week 17? Here's the latest update.

Is TreVeyon Henderson playing this week?

Henderson was limited in practice on Wednesday and Thursday as he makes his way through concussion protocol. He was on the field for practice again Friday but he was not wearing a red non-contact jersey, per ESPN's Mike Reiss.

That is a very promising sign for his status in Week 17 against the Jets. He had not been officially ruled out as of Friday afternoon.

Concussion protocol timelines are different depending on the player. Some players have cleared the league's five-step protocol in a week while others have taken longer. Henderson playing on Sunday would not be a shock.

Patriots RB depth chart

If Henderson is unable to start, the team will likely rely on veteran Rhamondre Stevenson to take the bulk of the carries against New York. He led the team in rushing in 2022 and 2024.

Crosby told Carroll that he wanted to leave the facility once informed of the team's decision. Carroll agreed.

""He knows that he's banged up, so he's talking about, 'I'd like to get out of here.' And I said, 'Yeah, get out of here.' So he took off,"" Carroll said. ""... This didn't just spring on him. We've been talking about it, and it was exactly what you would think he would do and he should do. I agree with him 1,000 percent on how he responded, and I [would have] responded the same way.""

Crosby has been dealing with a nagging knee injury since the Raiders' 31-0 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7 but has managed to play in every game thus far.

Crosby did not practice this week. After further evaluation, Carroll and the staff thought it was best to rest their best defensive player.

""Each week, he has done everything you could possibly imagine a guy could do to play, and he's been able to,"" Carroll said. ""But after an evaluation we did Monday or Tuesday, whenever it was, it just looks too bad.""

Carroll said it's a possibility that Crosby could also miss the team's season finale against the Chiefs, but an official decision has not been made. Carroll added that he doesn't think the move will impact their relationship.

He and Crosby spoke four times on Friday.

""Hopefully, the right conclusion for his long betterment,"" Carroll said.

Crosby is the third starter to be ruled out of the Raiders' Week 17 contest, in which the loser will assume control of the No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft. Tight end Brock Bowers and safety Jeremy Chinn were placed on injured reserve Wednesday.

Crosby was named to his fifth consecutive Pro Bowl after he totaled 10 sacks and 45 tackles (career-best 28 for loss) in 15 games. When Crosby was asked earlier in the week about the team potentially securing the top pick in the draft, he said, ""I don't give a s--- about the pick. I don't play for that.

The Buckeyes have five players who have the potential to become first-round picks. When Ohio State faces Miami in the Cotton Bowl on Dec. 31, those players will have another big stage where a strong performance can improve their draft stock.

Ohio State had 14 players drafted in 2025, six offensive and eight defensive, with four Buckeyes going in the first round. Defensive players make up four of the Buckeyes' five top NFL prospects for 2026.

Ohio State football NFL draft prospects

Here are five Buckeyes playing in the Cotton Bowl widely regarded as having the most NFL potential.

Caleb Downs

Safety Caleb Downs has been a key player in Ohio State's secondary since transferring from Alabama in 2024, recording 142 tackles and four interceptions across the last two seasons.

Against Miami, Downs will likely be tasked with disrupting the connection between quarterback Carson Beck and wide receiver Malachi Toney. While Downs' draft stock is already high, as he's projected to be a top-10 pick, helping Ohio State hold Toney to anything lower than his average of over six receptions per game would further solidify Downs' draft position.

Kayden McDonald

Last season, Ohio State defensive tackle Tyleik Williams was selected by the Detroit Lions with the 28th pick. Kayden McDonald hopes to be the next OSU player at the position to go in the first round.

If McDonald plays a key role in containing Miami running back Mark Fletcher Jr, who recorded 172 yards against Texas A&M in the first round of the playoff, it would boost McDonald's draft stock.

Arvell Reese

Linebacker Arvell Reese is in the conversation to be the 2026 NFL Draft's No. 1 overall pick. This season, Reese has 62 tackles and 6.5 sacks.

Outside of Ohio State, no team remaining in the playoffs has allowed fewer sacks than Miami. The Hurricanes have given up just 13 sacks in 2025. Reese getting to the quarterback for the first time since Nov. 1 against Penn State would ensure his name remains in the debate for the No. 1 pick.

Sonny Styles

Linebacker Sonny Styles, a Pickerington native, leads the Buckeyes in tackles with 45.

Against Indiana during the Big Ten title game, Styles recorded a career-high 12 tackles, and a similar performance at the Cotton Bowl could improve where he lands in the draft.

Carnell Tate

Wide receiver Carnell Tate is the highest-ranked offensive prospect from Ohio State, with mock drafts on ESPN and CBS Sports projecting him to land somewhere within the top 20 picks.

After missing three games this season due to injury, Tate returned to action against Michigan on Nov. 29 and has since recorded nine catches for 127 yards. Tate having a strong performance against Miami's defense is crucial in proving he's fully past his injury.

Ohio State vs. Miami prediction

Ohio State 14, Miami 7: It took Miami until the final two minutes of its first-round matchup against Texas A&M to score a touchdown and secure a spot in the Cotton Bowl. The Hurricanes will have an even smaller margin of error going against Ohio State's top-ranked scoring defense. If Miami repeats its slow start offensively, the Buckeyes should be able to capitalize, whether OSU's defense turns an error into a touchdown or the Ohio State offense finds a moment to break through the Hurricanes' top-5 scoring defense.

Ohio State vs. Miami TV channel, time

Ohio State kicks off against Miami at 7:30 p.m. on Dec. 31 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.

Both Love and Willis (shoulder/illness) were listed as questionable to play on Green Bay's initial injury report on Thursday. Love remains in concussion protocol and will miss the Week 17 game.

Green Bay clinched a playoff spot Thursday by virtue of Detroit's loss to Minnesota. A loss to Baltimore on Saturday would secure the NFC North title for the Chicago Bears.

Willis won't be the only backup quarterback to see action in Saturday's critical Week 17 game. Tyler Huntley is slated to start for the Ravens in place of Lamar Jackson, who's doubtful with a back contusion.

Through 15 starts this season, Love has completed 66.3% of his passes for 3,381 yards, 23 touchdowns and six interceptions.

Willis replaced Love under center in the aforementioned loss but hurt his right shoulder at the end of regulation.

,,2025-12-27 08:57:17+00:00,RotoWire,NFL Yahoo DFS Picks Week 17: Top Picks & Strategy Tips - RotoWire,Sasha Yodashkin,,,,,https://www.rotowire.com/football/article/nfl-yahoo-dfs-picks-week-17-top-picks-strategy-tips-101467,"The Week 17 NFL DFS Yahoo main slate begins Sunday at 1 p.m. EST and features nine games.
NFL DFS Yahoo lineups consist of one QB, two RBs, three WRs, one TE, one FLEX (RB/WR/TE) and one D/ST unit.
After hanging 45 points on the Dolphins in Week 16, Burrow and the Bengals could easily put up another 40-spot here.
They have been outscored 111-36 over their last three games, surrendering five passing TDs to Trevor Lawrence in Week 15 and a 10-148-2 line to Chris Olave in Week 16.
Ewers struggled in his first start in Week 16, posting a 0:2 TD:INT ratio against the normally putrid Bengals defense.","The Week 17 NFL DFS Yahoo main slate begins Sunday at 1 p.m. EST and features nine games. All of the byes for the 2025 season have wrapped up, but teams playing on Christmas (Cowboys-Commanders, Lions-Vikings and Broncos-Chiefs), Saturday (Texans-Chargers and Ravens-Packers), Sunday Night Football (Bears-49ers) and Monday Night Football (Rams-Falcons) are excluded from the main slate.

Playing in guaranteed prize pool (GPP) Yahoo DFS football contests is about chasing upside, while lineups geared toward head-to-head, 50/50 or double-up formats should prioritize high floors. The players you want to target for these different contest types aren't mutually exclusive, but winning a GPP tournament usually requires finding a hidden gem or going against the grain in a spot or two while building a solid base of the same chalk plays you would use anywhere. Against-the-grain plays typically consist of big-name players in tough matchups or boom-or-bust types with uncertain roles.

Keep in mind that Yahoo DFS football contests use 0.5 PPR scoring rather than full PPR, which lowers the comparative value of wide receivers and running backs (in that order) while especially affecting high-volume pass-catchers. NFL DFS Yahoo lineups consist of one QB, two RBs, three WRs, one TE, one FLEX (RB/WR/TE) and one D/ST unit. Suggested Yahoo DFS picks for Week 17 include one of the NFL's top stacks from the past few seasons, as well as a pair of veterans set for expanded roles in banged-up backfields.

QUARTERBACK

Joe Burrow, CIN vs. ARI ($39): There are a few pricey QBs who could be worth paying up for, but Burrow could be the best of the bunch against the reeling Cardinals. Cincinnati's star signal-caller has mustered a pair of four-touchdown performances in his last three starts, and this battle of fast-paced offenses and porous defenses is expected to produce the most points among games in Sunday's NFL DFS Yahoo main slate (over/under 52.5 points). Arizona's on a seven-game losing streak and has allowed at least 40 points in four of those seven losses. After hanging 45 points on the Dolphins in Week 16, Burrow and the Bengals could easily put up another 40-spot here.

Honorable Mentions: Trevor Lawrence, JAC at IND ($42); Drake Maye, NE at NYJ ($41); Tyler Shough, NO at TEN ($32)

Against the Grainers: Jaxson Dart, NYG at LV ($35); Baker Mayfield, TB at MIA ($33); Philip Rivers, IND vs. JAC ($21)

RUNNING BACK

Ashton Jeanty, LV vs. NYG ($36): Poor offensive line play and negative game scripts have limited Jeanty throughout his highly anticipated rookie season, but the 2025 sixth overall pick showed what he can do when the Raiders keep a game close by turning 25 touches into 188 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns against Houston's elite defense in a 23-21 Week 16 loss. The Raiders will have a chance to pick on someone their own size Sunday in a clash between 2-11 teams that's likely to decide who gets the first overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. Another hefty workload for Jeanty is likely to produce impressive results against a Giants defense that's allowing 122 rushing yards per game to RBs, which is second-most in the NFL.

Rhamondre Stevenson, NE at NYJ ($19): Stevenson could be in line for a massive workload if TreVeyon Henderson (concussion) isn't available, and even if Henderson plays, Stevenson's a nice value at just $19 in a Patriots offense that's likely to employ a run-heavy approach while being banged up at WR. The 12-3 Patriots are likely to play from ahead throughout against the 3-12 Jets, who have allowed a league-high 23 total TDs to RBs this season. Stevenson has recorded at least 77 scrimmage yards in three consecutive games, so he has been effective even while taking a back seat to Henderson.

Honorable Mentions: Chase Brown, CIN vs. ARI ($38); Tony Pollard, TEN vs. NO ($28); Michael Carter, ARI at CIN ($19)

Against the Grainers: Bucky Irving, TB at MIA ($32); Tyrone Tracy, NYG at LV ($27); Kenneth Gainwell, PIT at CLE ($23)

WIDE RECEIVER

Ja'Marr Chase, CIN vs. ARI ($40): Chase and Burrow have been the NFL's top stack over the past couple seasons, and it will likely be worth it to spend the marginal $6 of cap space on Chase over Tee Higgins ($34), especially if you also deploy Burrow. Even as a standalone option, Chase is likely to thrive against a Cardinals defense that allowed 32.2 fantasy points to Puka Nacua in Week 14 and 22.0 fantasy points to Nico Collins in Week 15. Chase has scored at least 18.2 fantasy points five times this season and has seen 59 targets in four games since the Bengals got Burrow back from a toe injury while recording at least 109 receiving yards in three of those four games. You would need to go bargain shopping elsewhere to fit the Burrow-Chase stack into your lineup, but they have the potential to combine for gargantuan numbers against the lowly Cardinals.

Stefon Diggs, NE at NYJ ($25): Diggs is coming off a 138-yard receiving performance against the Ravens in Week 16, and he's likely to get most of the attention from Drake Maye against the generous Jets defense since the Patriots could be without all of Kayshon Boutte (concussion), Mack Hollins (abdomen) and DeMario Douglas (hamstring). The Jets once boasted a formidable secondary but have depleted the roster via trades with an eye on the future. They have been outscored 111-36 over their last three games, surrendering five passing TDs to Trevor Lawrence in Week 15 and a 10-148-2 line to Chris Olave in Week 16. Kyle Williams ($10) could also play an expanded role.

Jakobi Meyers, JAC at IND ($22): It's tough to choose between Meyers, Brian Thomas ($24) and Parker Washington ($20), as all three are strong value plays with the Jaguars rolling on offense and Colts in free fall. Jacksonville is averaging 34.2 points per game during its six-game winning streak, and Lawrence has thrown multiple touchdown passes in five consecutive games, while the Colts have lost five straight and are allowing the second-most receiving yards per game to WRs (170) this season. Indianapolis has also allowed a league-high 201 catches to wideouts this season. Meyers offers the highest floor in Jacksonville's deep WR room, earning at least six targets in six consecutive games while averaging five catches for 60 yards and scoring three times in that span.

Honorable Mentions: Chris Olave, NO at TEN ($38); Michael Wilson, ARI at CIN ($29); Mike Evans, TB at MIA ($27)

Against the Grainers: A.J. Brown, PHI at BUF ($31); Alec Pierce, IND vs. JAC ($21); Jerry Jeudy, CLE vs. PIT ($17)

TIGHT END

Taysom Hill, NO at TEN ($10): Hill worked as the top backfield option for the Saints in Week 16, and he's likely to do so again Sunday since Alvin Kamara (knee/ankle) hasn't played or practiced since Week 12, Devin Neal is on IR due to a hamstring injury, and the Saints don't seem to trust Audric Estime or Evan Hull to handle more than complementary roles. Hill got 12 carries in the Week 16 win over the Jets compared to five apiece for Estime and Hull, and the versatile veteran also threw a 38-yard touchdown pass and caught four passes for 36 yards. Like Diggs, Hill tore his ACL last season, so they are both probably a little more explosive now than they were earlier in the campaign. Hill's unique position as a lead runner with TE eligibility makes him a low-risk, high-reward pick at the minimum $10 against a Titans defense that's allowing 26.9 points per game, which is seventh-most in the NFL.

Honorable Mentions: Trey McBride, ARI at CIN ($30); Harold Fannin, CLE vs. PIT ($20); Juwan Johnson, NO at TEN ($16)

Against the Grainers: Tyler Warren, IND vs. JAC ($17); Mike Gesicki, CIN vs. ARI ($12); Michael Mayer, LV vs. NYG ($10)

DEFENSE

Tampa Bay Buccaneers at MIA ($12): The Buccaneers still control their own destiny in the NFC South despite their 7-8 record, as they will make the playoffs with a win over the Dolphins this week and a victory over the Panthers in Week 18. Sunday's clash between teams from the Sunshine State offers an opportunity for Tampa Bay's defense to shine, as the Dolphins have punted on their season and will start rookie seventh-round pick Quinn Ewers for the second consecutive game. Ewers struggled in his first start in Week 16, posting a 0:2 TD:INT ratio against the normally putrid Bengals defense. The motivated Buccaneers defense will likely make things even tougher on the rookie, as Tampa Bay has a top-10 run defense and ranks in the top 10 with 20 forced turnovers, so Ewers could be forced to throw often against a unit that's adept at taking the ball away.

Honorable Mentions: Pittsburgh Steelers at CLE ($16); New England Patriots at NYJ ($15); New Orleans Saints at TEN ($15)

Against the Grainers: Philadelphia Eagles at BUF ($15); Buffalo Bills vs. PHI ($14); Las Vegas Raiders vs. NYG ($10)

Injuries are playing a major part of the Week 17 schedule, and bettors looking to place NFL bets for Week 17 need to know the most important NFL injuries of the week, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff.

Texans at Chargers (4:30 p.m. ET, Saturday)

LAC RB Kimani Vidal (neck, questionable)

The Chargers got rookie Omarion Hampton back three weeks ago, and he and Kimani Vidal have largely split touches over that time. That may not be the case this week, with Vidal questionable to suit up against the Texans' elite defense.

The Chargers are 1.5-point favorites. The total is 39.5.

Ravens at Packers (8 p.m. ET, Saturday)

BAL QB Lamar Jackson (back, doubtful)

GB QB Jordan Love (left shoulder and concussion, questionable)

GB QB Malik Willis (right shoulder and illness, questionable)

GB WR Christian Watson (shoulder and illness, questionable)

The Ravens have the slightest of hopes of making the playoffs, but their uphill battle got even harder this week with Lamar Jackson doubtful to play in a must-win game against the Packers. Jackson is far and away the most notable injury for Baltimore, but Green Bay has listed both starting quarterback Jordan Love and his backup Malik Willis as questionable, and it appears Love will not play. Standout receiver Christian Watson is also questionable for Green Bay.

The Packers are favored by 4.5, and the total is 39.5.

Seahawks at Panthers (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams are in good shape in the health department for this pivotal Week 17 clash. The Seahawks are in the driver's seat for both the NFC West crown as well as the No. 1 seed in the conference. Carolina knocked off Tampa Bay last week and, with a win and Bucs loss this week, could clinch the NFC South. Otherwise, Week 18 could be a massive matchup for the division title.

Seattle is favored by 7. The total is 42.5.

Buccaneers at Dolphins (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Both teams have a few players banged up here, but none that move the needle when it comes to betting lines. The Bucs are a game behind the Panthers in the NFC South and, with a win, would ensure that Week 18's rematch with Carolina has high stakes.

The Buccaneers are 5.5-point favorites, and the total is 44.5

Patriots at Jets (1 p.m. ET)

NE RB TreVeyon Henderson (concussion, questionable)

NE WR Kayshon Boutte (concussion, out)

NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)

The biggest injuries here are with rookies, with New England standout running back TreVeyon Henderson needing to clear concussion protocol for Sunday while New York is again without tight end Mason Taylor, who was a rare bright spot in a trying year for the Jets. Additionally, explosive Patriots receiver Kayshon Boutte is out with a concussion.

The Pats are massive 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.

Steelers at Browns (1 p.m. ET)

CLE RB Quinshon Judkins (ankle, out for year)

CLE RB Dylan Sampson (hand, questionable)

CLE TE Harold Fannin Jr. (groin, questionable)

CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)

PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)

The Browns are looking to play spoiler here, and their offense is hurting. Star rookie back Quinshon Judkins is out for the year after ankle surgery, so fellow rookie Dylan Sampson is in line to be the team's RB1 this week, though he's questionable with a hand injury that kept him out of the team's last two games. David Njoku is out again with a knee injury and fellow tight end, standout rookie Harold Fannin Jr., is questionable to play, though it appears he will suit up. The Steelers will still be without T.J. Watt this week after the star edge rusher underwent surgery to repair a collapsed lung. He returned to practice this week but will not suit up until Week 18 at the earliest.

Pittsburgh is a 3-point favorite on the road, and the total is 34.5 -- the lowest of Week 17.

Jaguars at Colts (1 p.m. ET)

IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, questionable)

The Jags are relatively healthy here, while the Colts, who started the year 8-2, are trying to win out and get some help to sneak into the postseason as a wild card team. Indianapolis traded two first-round picks at the deadline for cornerback Sauce Gardner, who is hoping to return to the lineup after a lengthy absence. He's questionable for this AFC South clash. The Jaguars can clinch the AFC South with a win here if the Texans also lose to or tie with the Chargers on Saturday.

Jacksonville is a 5.5-point favorite. The total is 48.5.

Saints at Titans (1 p.m. ET)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)

NO WR Chris Olave (back, questionable)

The Saints will again be without standout running back Alvin Kamara, though they found an interesting replacement last week in tight end/quarterback/running back hybrid Taysom Hill, who had 78 yards from scrimmage and also a passing score to Chris Olave, who is officially questionable but is aiming to suit up.

The Saints are favored by 2.5, and the total is 39.5.

Cardinals at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)

ARI S Budda Baker (concussion and thumb, out)

ARI WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, questionable)

Both teams have crowded injury reports, but the Cardinals continue to have some awful luck in that department for Week 17. Star safety Budda Baker is out, putting a dent in an already poor Arizona defense. The offense got Marvin Harrison Jr. back last week, but he's questionable again with a nagging heel injury.

The Bengals are 7.5-point favorites. The total is 53.5 -- the highest of the week.

Giants at Raiders (4:05 p.m. ET)

LV DE Maxx Crosby (knee, out)

LV TE Brock Bowers (knee, out for year)

Star Raiders edge rusher Maxx Crosby is out this week against the Giants, and there's reportedly drama between him and the team. Per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, the Raiders told Crosby they wanted to shut him down for the remaining two games, and he disagreed and left the facility. Additionally, the team placed second-year tight end Brock Bowers on season-ending injured reserve this week.

New York is a slim 1.5-point favorite. The total is 41.5.

Eagles at Bills (4:25 p.m. ET)

BUF TE Dalton Kincaid (knee, questionable)

BUF TE Dawson Knox (knee, questionable)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (knee, foot, out)

Buffalo's tight end depth may get tested here with both Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox questionable with knee injuries in this potential Super Bowl preview against last year's champs, the Eagles. Philadelphia will get star defensive tackle Jalen Carter back after a brief absence, but it won't have right tackle Lane Johnson once again.

Buffalo is a 1.5-point favorite, and the total is 43.5.

Bears at 49ers (8:20 p.m. ET)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, out)

SF TE George Kittle (ankle, questionable)

SF WR Ricky Pearsall (knee, questionable)

This potential NFL playoff preview has a few big-name pass catchers out or questionable. The Bears will again be down second-year receiver Rome Odunze as he battles a foot injury, and Chicago will certainly be aiming to get him back for the postseason. As for the 49ers, star tight end George Kittle is questionable after not practicing all week while receiver Ricky Pearsall is in danger of missing his ninth game of the year.

San Francisco is favored by 3, and the total is 52.5.

Rams at Falcons (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, TBD)

All eyes are on the status of Davante Adams, who missed last week's epic clash with the Seahawks. Adams is the NFL's receiving touchdowns leader, and he can help the Rams two-fold Sunday, as a win helps their playoff standing and also pushes the Falcons further up the NFL Draft order, which is good for L.A. as the team owns Atlanta's first-round pick in April.

Los Angeles is a 7.5-point road favorite. The total is 49.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/29/72e7f03d-e284-40a8-93a7-8769001b775f/thumbnail/1200x675/dde127506b7ea5172563093939b9bdd4/lamar-jackson-baltimore-ravens-imagn-images-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-27 12:00:52.228203

Bryant suffered a knee injury that held him out of the second half of the Rams game and did not practice at all this week.","The Seattle Seahawks will be without a couple of key pieces in their effort to stay atop the NFC against the Carolina Panthers.

Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald announced they would be without starting left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant. The Panthers’ game is the second straight game Cross will miss after suffering a hamstring injury, which might put an end to his regular season, against the Indianapolis Colts.

Josh Jones, a versatile offensive lineman who signed with the Seahawks in the offseason, will start in Cross’ place for the second week in a row. Jones played his first significant snaps for the Seahawks last week against the Los Angeles Rams and did not allow a sack against a hungry Rams’ pass rush.

The Seahawks will once again be turning toward Ty Okada for help in the secondary with the loss of Coby Bryant. Bryant suffered a knee injury that held him out of the second half of the Rams game and did not practice at all this week.

Okada has been instrumental for Seattle this season, providing relief when safety Julian Love missed time in the first half of 2025. He’s totaled 58 tackles and snagged his first career interception with an immaculate catch against the Washington Commanders.

The good news for the Seahawks is that Bryant and Cross are the only starters with injury woes after receiving positive news on Riq Woolen and Nick Emmanwori earlier this week. It’s starting to feel like 2013 again as the Seahawks head to Carolina with the NFC’s No. 1 seed on the line on Sunday.",https://platform.fieldgulls.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/81/2025/12/gettyimages-2249816648.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.739416236798%2C100%2C78.521167526403&w=1200,N,,2025-12-26 23:58:25.453026

Gardner, who landed in Indianapolis after a blockbuster trade in November with the New York Jets, played just two full games with the Colts since his arrival because of a calf injury. That undermined the Colts' plans to make him a centerpiece of a talented secondary, which has also been without its other primary perimeter cornerback, Charvarius Ward.

After returning to practice this week, Gardner will play on Sunday against the Jacksonville Jaguars, according to coach Shane Steichen.

The news was not as promising with Buckner. He will be placed on season-ending injured reserve after an ill-fated attempt to finish the season. A herniated disk in his neck that landed Buckner on injured reserve in November showed some promise last week, when Buckner was activated and played against the San Francisco 49ers on ""Monday Night Football."" But Buckner aggravated the injury in that game, Steichen said, and will now require surgery.

Buckner said the disk was pressing on a nerve and left him without upper-body strength on his left side. He knew the delicate nature of the injury made playing risky, but Buckner wanted to try.

""Obviously, I know what's at stake [for the team], but also I know what's at stake for me long term in my life,"" he said.

Buckner, who has been one of the Colts' primary leaders since his arrival in 2020, should be able to return next season, Steichen said.

The Green Bay Packers' superstar edge rusher noted that in the days after he suffered a season-ending ACL injury earlier this month.

While Parsons immediately proclaimed he would ""rise again"" and that his goal is to return at the beginning of next season, his latest update this week further reveals his mindset as he begins his long recovery back.

""Two weeks in, I've accepted the pain and the reality of this journey,"" Parsons wrote on X Christmas Day. ""Some days are heavy, some days aren't but every day brings its own fight.

""My courage, my strength, and my mind have all been tested. Still, I won't stop. I won't quit until I'm back. I'm grateful God chose me.""

Parsons suffered the noncontact ACL injury in the second half of the Packers' game against the Denver Broncos on Dec. 14. He had just broken through Broncos offensive linemen and had his eyes on quarterback Bo Nix. But as he was planting his left foot, he stopped in his tracks and grabbed his leg.

Parsons fell to the ground and needed assistance getting off the field.

The Packers confirmed Parsons tore his ACL the next day.

Micah Parsons surgery update: Did Micah Parsons have surgery?

Parsons has not had surgery to repair his torn ACL, Packers coach Matt LaFleur said earlier this week.

But LaFleur said surgery would be coming.

After the injury, Parsons flew to the Dallas area for the birth of his third child. Parsons was expected to return to the facility Dec. 24.

Micah Parsons stats

Before the injury, Parsons was nearly unstoppable in his first season with the Packers. The Packers acquired the three-time All-Pro days before the season in a blockbuster trade with the Dallas Cowboys that shocked the NFL.

The 25-year-old lived up to the hype.

A true game wrecker who faced double teams which seemed like every snap, Parsons would earn his fifth Pro Bowl nod, the only Packers representative.

Late last month in a win over the Detroit Lions, Parsons recorded his 12th sack, becoming the only player in NFL history to have at least a dozen sacks in each of his first five years. Packers icon Reggie White previously had the record with four consecutive seasons.

Among the starters already ruled out are wide receivers Kayshon Boutte (concussion) and Mack Hollins (abdomen); defensive end Harold Landry III (knee); linebacker Robert Spillane (ankle) and left guard Jared Wilson (concussion).

Meanwhile, Vrabel said defensive tackle Milton Williams (ankle) will not be activated to the active roster this week after being designated to return from the injured reserve list on Tuesday. Williams' projected replacement, Khyiris Tonga, will also miss Sunday's game with a foot injury, according to Vrabel. In addition, reserve receiver DeMario ""Pop"" Douglas is questionable with a hamstring injury.

""Everybody deals with it. This is not something that's new to the National Football League. We'll elevate some guys [from the practice squad] and have to sign some guys and go from there,"" Vrabel said.

The Patriots were hit hard with injuries in last Sunday's comeback win over the Baltimore Ravens, with Henderson, who leads the team with 776 rushing yards on 148 carries (5.2 avg.), leaving the game in the second quarter after banging the back of his head on the ground while being tackled.

Henderson practiced on a limited basis Wednesday in a red, noncontact jersey, which was the first sign he was progressing through concussion protocol. Then in the team's next practice Friday, he was in a regular jersey, which suggested he had taken another step forward. The team listed him as a full participant.

The final step for players in concussion protocol to be cleared for game action is being evaluated by an independent neurological consultant.

The Patriots (12-3) can capture their first AFC East title since 2019 if they win their final two games -- at the Jets (3-12) and at home against the Miami Dolphins (6-9). If they win both games, and the Denver Broncos lose to the visiting Los Angeles Chargers in Week 18, they would earn the AFC's No. 1 seed and a first-round bye.

A win over the Jets on Sunday would also make them 8-0 on the road this season.

""I think that it would mean a lot. We know how difficult that is,"" Vrabel said of posting an undefeated road record, with the final game against a division opponent. ""Nothing is guaranteed.

Jordan Love will miss the Packers' Week 17 game against Baltimore with a concussion and left shoulder injury.

Malik Willis looks poised get the start with Love sidelined in Week 17. The former third-round pick finished out the Packers' loss to Chicago in Love's place and performed well. He completed 9 of 11 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown. He added 10 carries for 44 rushing yards.

Willis was also on the injury report this week due to a right shoulder injury and illness. He did not practice on Wednesday and was limited during the team's final practice on Thursday. Practice squad quarterback Clayton Tune is expected to be elevated to Willis' backup for Saturday's game against Baltimore.

NFC North standings

Here's how things look entering Week 17:

Chicago Bears: 11-4 (2-3 NFC North)

Green Bay Packers: 9-5-1 (4-1)

Minnesota Vikings: 8-8 (3-2)

Detroit Lions: 8-8 (1-4)

Both the Vikings and Lions are eliminated from playoff and division contention. It's down to the Bears and the Packers for the NFC North crown; whichever team doesn't get it will likely be the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs.

Packers' chances, odds to win NFC North

Green Bay has already secured a playoff spot regardless of what happens over the final two weeks of the regular season. Win out, lose out or split, it doesn't matter. They'll be in the postseason.

As things stand, the Bears are the heavy favorites to win the NFC North over the Packers because Green Bay does not control its own destiny. The Packers need to win out against the Ravens and Vikings in addition to the Bears losing out against the 49ers and Lions in order to win the title.

BetMGM's latest NFL odds put the Packers at +650 to win the division compared to -1000 for the Bears. The Athletic's playoff simulator gives the Bears an 86% chance to win the NFC North title compared to 14% for Green Bay.

On Friday, head coach Mike Vrabel spoke about the progress he saw at practice from Williams this week.
The Patriots lengthy injury report comes at a time when the playoff-bound Pats are gearing up for the postseason.
However, the Patriots roster is banged up, with 10-plus players coming out of last week's game with bumps and bruises.
Vrabel indicated that the Patriots will make multiple roster moves with seven players ruled out and two listed as questionable.","On Friday, the Patriots ruled out OLB Harold Landry III (knee), LB Robert Spillane (ankle), DT Khyiris Tonga (foot), WR Kayshon Boutte (concussion), WR Mack Hollins (abdomen), LG Jared Wilson (concussion), and DT Milton Williams (ankle). New England also listed WR DeMario Douglas (hamstring), RB TreVeyon Henderson (concussion), and CB Charles Woods (foot), as questionable for Week 17.

Despite being eligible to return from injured reserve this week, Williams will not be activated for Sunday's game. The Patriots have 21 days from his return to practice on Tuesday to activate Williams, who is one of their best defenders. The Pats will be a little thin on the interior D-Line behind starter Christian Barmore without Williams, Tonga, and rookie Joshua Farmer (placed on IR). New England will likely lean on DT Cory Durden and DT Eric Gregory, while Jeremiah Pharms Jr. and Leonard Taylor III are also options to be elevated from the practice squad this week. On Friday, head coach Mike Vrabel spoke about the progress he saw at practice from Williams this week.

""Just trying to get back into it. I think he's working hard. I would say that it'd be tough to see a lot just from the way that the practices were structured, but he's working hard to get back, and again, it's good to see him out there with the team. That's just the first step of it,"" Vrabel said of Williams.

The Patriots will also be shorthanded at the skill positions with Boutte (concussion) and Hollins (abdomen) ruled out. Douglas (hamstring) is banged up as well, and Henderson is progressing toward clearing concussion protocol after practicing in a full capacity on Friday, giving him a chance to play on Sunday – all four Patriots playmakers were injured in last Sunday night's win over the Ravens.

At wide receiver, Boutte was placed in concussion protocol after a hard landing on a deep target late in last Sunday's win. Boutte went up to catch a pass from QB Drake Maye, and appeared to be interfered with by Ravens CB Marlon Humphrey, but there weren't any flags on the play. Humphrey was wrapped around Boutte's legs as he attempted to make the catch, causing the Pats wideout to take a hard fall, landing him in concussion protocol.

As for Hollins, it's unclear when he sustained his abdominal injury, while Douglas did not return after exiting the game in the second quarter last week. New England's healthy wideouts are Stefon Diggs, Kyle Williams, and undrafted rookie Efton Chism III, who has appeared in only six games this season with only 25 snaps on offense. The Patriots also have John Jiles, Jeremiah Webb, and Brandon Smith on the practice squad. Smith signed earlier this week, while Jiles and Webb have been with the team since training camp.

As for the running back position, Henderson practiced without a non-contact jersey on Friday. If he remains symptom-free after going through full football activities at Friday's practice (phase five), Henderson can be cleared in time to play on Sunday. Currently, the Pats healthy backs are Rhamondre Stevenson and RB/KR D'Ernest Johnson. New England also has veteran RB Elijah Mitchell and second-year RB Jashaun Corbin on the practice squad.

Along the offensive line, Wilson will miss his third game this season due to a concussion, but will likely be replaced by super-sub Ben Brown, who recently signed a contract extension with the Patriots. Brown has played well in his two spot-starts at left guard this season, allowing just three total pressures with zero sacks in games against the Panthers and Giants, while also entering the Patriots win over the Bengals early in Week 12 (two pressures allowed).

New England is in good shape to replace their rookie left guard with Brown available to step in, and after visiting the blue medical tent last Sunday, starting RT Morgan Moses (knee) is should be good to go, while top backup Thayer Munford will hopefully be available as well. The Patriots projected starting offensive line vs. the Jets this week is LT Vederain Lowe, LG Ben Brown, C Garrett Bradbury, RG Mike Onwenu, and RT Morgan Moes.

Moving back over to the defense, the Patriots have to navigate several injuries in the front seven. New England will be down starting LB Robert Spillane and starting edge rusher Harold Landry III, along with Tonga and Williams.

Landry, who has been playing through injury since Week 6, will rest his injured knee on Sunday. Over the last nine games, Landry's pressure rate has dropped to 7.3% compared to a 10.7% in the first five weeks before his injury scare in New Orleans. Landry has been playing through the injury while practicing sparingly during the week, but will be out on Sunday. Last week, Anfernee Jennings (19 snaps), Jahlani Tavai (15 snaps), and Elijah Ponder (five snaps) chipped on the edge with Landry playing a season-low 54.5% snap rate. Rookie pass-rusher Bradyn Swinson could also be active.

At linebacker, Spillane has not played since the Patriots victory over the Giants in Week 13. The Pats captain's absence has contributed to New England's struggles against the run, as the defense has allowed 4.3 yards per carry without Spillane on the field. Once again, the Patriots will likely rely on linebackers Jack Gibbens, Christian Ellliss, and Jahlani Tavai to stop the Jets rushing attack on Sunday afternoon.

The Patriots lengthy injury report comes at a time when the playoff-bound Pats are gearing up for the postseason. On the one hand, New England wants to win the AFC East, with a win over the Jets and a Bills loss to the Eagles securing a division title in Week 17 (the Patriots will win the division with wins in their last two games). They're also playing for seeding in the AFC playoffs, with a chance to be the No. 1 overall seed in the conference still in play.

However, the Patriots roster is banged up, with 10-plus players coming out of last week's game with bumps and bruises. And the Pats will be playing in the playoffs. Yes, seeding is important, but there's an argument to be made that the health of their top contributors is more critical. For head coach Mike Vrabel, that presents a difficult decision of going full-tilt for the No. 1 seed versus continuing to try to win while resting players with more severe injuries.

Vrabel indicated that the Patriots will make multiple roster moves with seven players ruled out and two listed as questionable. New England will likely need to add depth at defensive tackle, wide receiver, and possibly running back. Typically, the Pats have five active defensive tackles and wide receivers, but they have only two standard elevations from the practice squad available. Therefore, they might need to make room for a signing to the 53-man roster.

We'll keep you updated on what should be a busy Saturday of transactions for the Patriots ahead of Sunday's tilt vs. the Jets at MetLife Stadium.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/j9e6uivvlqyeoriabn4u,N,,2025-12-26 21:14:43.464416

Bowers, the Raiders 2024 first-round draft pick, was an All-Pro last season and has made two Pro Bowls in his first two NFL seasons.","Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Maxx Crosby will sit for Sunday's game against the New York Giants due to a knee injury.

According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, it's the team's decision to shut down the five-time Pro Bowler ""with Crosby’s best interest in mind,"" even as Crosby wants to be on the field.

Subsequent reports painted Crosby as unhappy with the situation. Jay Glazer of Fox Sports and Ryan McFadden of ESPN both report the pass-rusher left the building after being informed his season was over, with Glazer claiming Crosby “vehemently disagreed” with the decision.

Raiders head coach Pete Carroll later confirmed the story:

“He was talking about ‘I’d like to get outta here’ and I said, ‘Yeah, get outta here.’ So he took off … It was exactly like you would think he would do, and he should do. I agree with him a 1000 percent on how he responded. I responded the same way and I get it.”

While the Raiders may want to not risk further injury for Crosby, they are also chasing the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft. In facing a fellow 2-13 team in the Giants on Sunday, a defeat would improve their chances and not having their best defensive player would aid in that pursuit.

According to the NFL, this will be only the third time in NFL history that two teams that are 11-plus games under .500 will meet and the first time since 1991.

The 27-year-old Crosby was vocal earlier this week about caring more about helping the Raiders win rather than about a first overall draft pick.

""Yeah, I don’t give a s*** about the pick, to be honest,"" Crosby said Tuesday. ""I don't play for that. That's not my job. My job is to be the best defensive end in the world. That's what I focus on every day. Being a great leader, being an influence. Being that guy on a consistent basis for my team.""

Crosby has been in the NFL since 2019 and has played 110 regular-season games with the Raiders, but only one playoff game. The Raiders have only two playoff appearances — and zero playoff wins — since appearing in Super Bowl XXXVII at the end of the 2002 season.

Crosby won't be the only Raiders star who will miss out this weekend. Tight end Brock Bowers was placed on injured reserve Wednesday with a knee injury that limited him to 12 games this season.

Bowers, the Raiders 2024 first-round draft pick, was an All-Pro last season and has made two Pro Bowls in his first two NFL seasons. After recording 112 catches for 1,194 yards and five touchdowns in 2024, the injury affected his output this season as he'll finish with 680 receiving yards, with 64 receptions and seven touchdowns.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WRQx0owiYDrCUPzECyPfjg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/f7728090-e29b-11f0-bbfc-dfdd2315ff26,N,,2025-12-27 09:59:03.296816

When the Seahawks suit up on Sunday at Carolina, they will be without safety Coby Bryant who is out with a knee injury. Macdonald said the injury doesn’t seem to be season ending or serious.

""It's just a process on getting him back,"" Macdonald said. ""We've just got to go through it, but he's working his tail off, and hopefully we'll get him back soon.""

Josh Jones Getting The Start Again

After getting his first start with Seattle last week against the Los Angeles Rams, Josh Jones is expected to be making his second start of the season in place of an injured Charles Cross.

Following that game, Macdonald said, ""Josh (Jones) did a great job coming in for Charles (Cross). Not playing after a while and not getting full speed reps all week, maybe it took him a little bit to get his feet wet, but once he did, I thought he thought he did a great job.""

Jones had appeared in 11 games prior to last week and ahead of Sunday's game Macdonald said, ""Well, the guys were excited for how he played and to see him on tape making plays for us. But I wouldn't say our expectations change at all or confidence in what he can do. I don't think any of that changes.""

Injured Reserve Player Updates

Right now Seattle has a handful of players on injured reserve including receiver Tory Horton (shin), running back George Holani (hamstring) and linebacker Chazz Surratt (ankle). On Horton, Macdonald said there is no update on his injury, but that he is working to get back.

""I really think it's a matter of if we're going to get there or we're not going to get there,"" Macdonald said. ""As a coach, it's like, yeah, of course we want him back yesterday, but it's just not the way it works. So the more time you spend worrying about it, you're going to drive yourself crazy.

NFL Week 17 playoff picture: Packers earn berth after Vikings eliminate Lions; Broncos chasing AFC's top seed

Tyler Sullivan

The Packers have already clinched a spot in the playoffs thanks to the Detroit Lions' loss to the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday, and there is still some hope they can catch the Bears to win the division. A Green Bay loss or Chicago win on Saturday would shut down any hopes of a division win, however, and Green Bay will now be without key players on both the offensive and defensive side of the ball.

Willis is expected to be under center for Green Bay on Saturday, though Willis was also listed as questionable on the injury report after suffering a shoulder injury at the end of regulation against the Bears.

New England's receiving unit will be thin in Week 17 with Boutte and Hollins both out, along with Douglas as questionable. On a more positive note, TreVeyon Henderson was a full participant on Friday, so he is trending in a positive direction. Meanwhile, the defense will also be down a handful of key contributors, including Landry and Spillane. Head coach Mike Vrabel also announced that Milton Williams will not be activated off of IR for this game.

Tyrod Taylor did not practice with the Jets on Friday, but the team noted it was due to non-injury-related reasons. The veteran quarterback does not have an injury designation.

New York will be without starting tackle Andrew Thomas for this matchup against the Raiders, which could have ramifications for the No. 1 overall pick at the 2026 NFL Draft. Thomas was sidelined throughout the week with a hamstring injury.

The Raiders placed star tight end Brock Bowers on injured reserve earlier this week, ending his season and ruling him out for Week 17. Star pass rusher Maxx Crosby is being held out of the lineup for Sunday's game against the Giants, and Week 18, due to a knee injury he's been battling most of the season. Crosby was not happy.

Love is still recovering from a concussion he suffered during last week's loss to the Chicago Bears. He's also listed with a left shoulder injury.

Malik Willis, whom the Packers officially listed as ""questionable"" with a right shoulder injury and illness, is expected to start instead, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Willis, a 2022 third-round pick out of Liberty, played admirably in Love's place last week in Chicago, but the Packers still fell in overtime after an improbable Bears fourth-quarter comeback that included 10 points in the final two minutes of regulation and an onside kick recovery.

Love's concussion stemmed from a helmet-to-helmet hit he sustained midway through the second quarter while being sacked by Bears defensive end Austin Booker.

Fortunately for Green Bay, it already has a spot reserved in the playoffs. With the Detroit Lions turning the ball over six times and dropping a road game to the Minnesota Vikings on Christmas Day, the Packers booked their ticket to the postseason for the sixth time in the past seven seasons.

Without Love, the 9-5-1 Packers will take on a 7-8 Baltimore Ravens team that needs the Pittsburgh Steelers to lose Sunday against the Cleveland Browns to have a chance at winning the AFC North.

The Ravens could very well be without their starting quarterback Saturday at Lambeau Field, too. Lamar Jackson is listed as doubtful for the Week 17 matchup as he deals with a back injury. Jackson hasn't practiced all week. He missed three games earlier this season with a hamstring injury. He's also battled knee, ankle and toe injuries.

Tyler Huntley is in position to make his second start of the season. After being elevated from the practice squad, Huntley helped the Ravens snap a four-game losing streak earlier this year. Replacing struggling backup Cooper Rush, Huntley got the nod in Week 8 and played a part in Baltimore returning to the win column with a 30-16 victory over the Bears.

Huntley started 10 games in Jackson's absence during his four-season stay with the Ravens from 2020-23, including a playoff game during the 2022 season. That season, Huntley went 2-2 down the stretch of the regular season and ended up earning a spot in the Pro Bowl.

If Baltimore wins Saturday, Pittsburgh loses Sunday and then the Ravens beat the Steelers in Week 18, the Ravens will sneak into the postseason as the division winner.

As for the Packers, they still have a shot to win the NFC North. But a Packers loss Saturday or a Bears win Sunday — they play on the road versus the San Francisco 49ers — would return the division crown to Chicago.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hJ1eayR0tJC.V3uf8hXKBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/f0cf2c10-e29c-11f0-9ef1-75ec4763566a,N,,2025-12-26 23:58:41.565955

Love was downgraded from questionable to out on Friday after he sustained a concussion in last Saturday's overtime loss to the Chicago Bears because he did not clear all the required stages of the concussion protocol. Willis finished the game against the Bears in relief of Love but injured his right (throwing) shoulder on the final play of regulation.

Both Love and Willis were limited participants in practice this week, although Willis missed a day because of an illness that has been going through the Packers' locker room.

""It's just a very delicate issue, you know what I'm saying in terms of, we've seen it with certain guys they come in, they feel great one day and then the next day they don't,"" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said earlier this week of Love's path through the concussion protocol. ""So it kind of is a little bit of a moving target,

Clayton Tune, who has spent the entire season on the practice squad, will likely serve as Willis' backup. The Packers will have to add him to the roster on Saturday because he was not part of Friday's roster moves. The Packers placed linebacker Kristian Welch (ankle) on injured reserve, which could clear a spot for Tune. Also, the Packers downgraded guard Aaron Banks (neck/illness) and receiver Savion Williams (foot/illness) to questionable.

They might have to do it without their franchise quarterback.

Lamar Jackson has officially been listed as doubtful for Saturday with a back injury. He hasn't practiced all week and suffered the injury during last week's loss to the New England Patriots, leaving the game at halftime after an awkward slide in the second quarter. He was termed day-to-day earlier this week, but now appears likely to miss the Packers game.

Baltimore needs a win, or else the Pittsburgh Steelers will clinch the AFC North title with two games left to play.

The Ravens' opponent, meanwhile, has its own QB issues to sort out. On Friday, the Packers officially ruled Jordan Love out as he works his way back from a concussion, so Malik Willis will get the start Saturday night.

[NFL injury updates live]

Love sustained the concussion in last week's loss to the Chicago Bears. Willis had also been questionable with an undisclosed illness and a right shoulder injury. Willis returned to practice in a limited capacity on Thursday after missing Wednesday's session with the illness.

Other notable Week 17 injuries:

The San Francisco 49ers got good news this week when it was reported that George Kittle avoided a high-ankle sprain during Monday night's win over the Indianapolis Colts. Kittle is reportedly dealing with a ""mid-to-low ankle sprain"" and general manager John Lynch said Friday that the tight end will likely be a game-time decision for Sunday.

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is off the injury report and will play Sunday against the Eagles. Allen went down with a foot injury in last week's game.

TreVeyon Henderson practiced on Friday without a red, non-contact jersey after being in concussion protocol following Sunday night's win over the Baltimore Ravens. He is questionable. Receivers Kayshon Boutte (concussion) and Mack Hollins (abdomen) have been ruled out.

T.J. Watt has been ruled out for the Pittsburgh Steelers' Week 17 game against the Cleveland Browns days after returning to the practice field. Just two weeks after he suffered a partially punctured lung and had to undergo surgery, Watt took the practice field for the first time on Wednesday as a limited participant, doing individual drills with the defense.

For the most part, the Patriots have managed to avoid suffering any long-term, season-ending injuries this season. The short-term injuries are beginning to pile up, though, and it very nearly cost New England against Baltimore.

While the team’s Week 17 opponent, the New York Jets, is a significantly worse team, this is a game that the Pats have to win. Accomplishing that goal may be a bit more difficult than expected, as Vrabel ruled out seven players for the team ahead of this game.

“WR DeMario Douglas (hamstring) and RB TreVeyon Henderson (concussion) are questionable.”

New England wants to win the AFC East division, but prioritizing health for the postseason is going to be more important. Even with all of these guys out, though, the Patriots should still beat the Jets; it just may be a little bit more difficult than initially expected.

Having both Demario Douglas and TreVeyon Henderson active for this game would be huge for New England, so it will be worth keeping tabs on them over the next couple of days.

The Kansas City Current co-owner, 30, shared a series of family photos to Instagram on Thursday, Dec. 25, with her and Patrick's three children, Sterling Skye, 5, Patrick ""Bronze"" Lavon Mahomes III, 4, and Golden Raye, 11 months, posing with Santa Claus.

She kicked off her post with a sweet black and white family picture showing the family of five smiling as they posed for a photo outdoors. She followed this up with a series of what appeared to be professional photos of the kids taken with Santa Claus. Bronze and Golden Raye could be seen sitting on a couch as Kris Kringle posed behind them, making a ""shh"" gesture.

It appears that the newest family member was not all too happy to see the big man in red, as she could be seen crying as Santa held her in one photo. The trio of kids could also be seen posing together with Santa in another photo.

Brittany then shared more private family moments on the big day, showing her little ones on Christmas morning in matching green pajamas, which featured gingerbread and candy canes. She also showed Golden Raye posing with a little Santa hat on her head.

Other photos showed the children playing with their new toy sets and the family posing once again together in the living room of their home in matching green and blue checkered pajamas. The final picture showed Patrick sporting a knee brace as he continues to recover from injury.

""Merry Christmas🎄❤️,"" Brittany captioned the photos.

Ahead of Golden’s arrival, the longtime couple made sure to make plenty of holiday memories with their two eldest children and showed off the sweet moments with posts to social media.

In early December 2024, after the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback and his team pulled off a 19-17 victory over their AFC West rival Los Angeles Chargers, the NFL star took his wife and kids ice skating.

Brittany documented their evening by posting a photo of her Sterling wearing a white sweatsuit set as she sat on a red toddler buggy on the ice. Several large trees with lights could be seen in the background.

One of several pictures shared from their outing was a group photo of Patrick and Brittany smiling while bundled up for the cold as they held their kids, who each wore matching sweatsuit sets.

Later that month, the former soccer player shared a Christmas Eve upload to Instagram featuring a carousel of professional photos.

The family wore traditional holiday colors — such as green, red and white — and gathered around a Christmas tree surrounded by presents. Santa Claus even joined in on a couple of the pictures.

The good news is that Jalen Carter (shoulders) made it through the full week of practice and is expected to make his return against the Bills after missing the last three games. The Pro Bowl defensive tackle had a procedure on both shoulders about a month ago and said earlier this week that he’s feeling the positive effects.

A.J. Brown (teeth) and Landon Dickerson (illness) both returned to practice on Friday after missing time earlier in the week and are also good to go.

Brown had wisdom teeth removed this week; he enters this game with 935 yards on the season. Dickerson has dealt with a calf injury in recent weeks but was listed with just an illness this week.

Out: RT Lane Johnson (foot), LB Nakobe Dean (hamstring)

Questionable: OT Cameron Williams (shoulder)

This will be Johnson’s sixth straight missed game with a Lisfranc sprain he suffered against the Lions on Nov. 16. Expect Fred Johnson to start in his place. The veteran has performed well in relief over the last month and a half. With just two games left in the regular season, there’s a chance we don’t see Lane Johnson until the playoffs begin in January.

Philadelphia Eagles

Complete coverage of the Philadelphia Eagles and their NFL rivals from NBC Sports Philadelphia.

Dean suffered that hamstring injury against the Commanders in the first half last week. Rookie Jihaad Campbell will start in his place. Campbell started the first eight games this season before Dean returned from PUP. The first-round pick from Alabama has played sparingly in recent weeks but has shown promise this year.

All seven players who were full participants on Thursday were back on the field Friday: LB Zack Baun (hand), LB Jihaad Campbell (back/ankle), DT Jalen Carter (shoulders), T Fred Johnson (calf), TE Cameron Latu (stinger), WR DeVonta Smith (illness), T Cameron Williams (shoulder)

The Eagles this week practiced on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. They had off for Christmas Day.

Meanwhile, Bills QB Josh Allen (foot) was limited a couple days this week but was a full participant on Friday and does not have a game designation.

“He’s gotten better each day and is trending in the right direction and will be ready to play,” said McDermott, who added that he does not see any limitations regarding the game plan and what Allen can and can’t do. “The soreness has dissipated throughout the week.”

Allen, as he always does when he has an injury, completely downplayed its seriousness on Tuesday and said, “Feels good, ready to go. Still sore, walk through today so really not a practice, but feeling good. Yes, planning on playing.”

Jordan Poyer, DaQuan Jones ruled out in Bills injury report

The news wasn’t as good concerning safety Jordan Poyer and defensive tackle DaQuan Jones, both of whom have been ruled out, two absences that figure to be heavily felt for a Buffalo defense that has struggled most of the season and now faces a daunting challenge against the Eagles.

Poyer suffered a hamstring injury late in last week’s victory over Cleveland, while Jones kept alive the season-long trend of players getting hurt in practice as he tweaked the calf injury that he originally suffered in the warm-up prior to the Week 6 game in Atlanta.

These are both big losses for the Buffalo defense because Poyer - who played great against the Browns - has had a significant impact since taking over for Taylor Rapp, particularly with how he has helped second-year safety Cole Bishop. And Jones is the Bills’ most accomplished defensive tackle with Ed Oliver on injured reserve, and his inactive status really cuts deep into the Bills’ rotation.

They now will go into this game with Larry Ogunjobi (who was a healthy scratch last week because he has played poorly), rookies Deone Walker and TJ Sanders and underwhelming Phidarian Mathis. Not great facing the Eagles excellent offensive line blocking for star running back Saquon Barkley.

Either rookie Jordan Hancock or veteran Cam Lewis figures to be the replacement for Poyer, and the dropoff could be notable, especially against a Philadelphia offense that features a dynamic passing game threesome of wide receivers AJ Brown and Devonta Smith, and tight end Dallas Goedert.

Others on the Buffalo Bills injury report

Also out is defensive tackle Jordan Phillips and kicker Matt Prater, neither of those coming as a surprise. It means Michael Badgley will get a second game as the Bills’ kicker. Last week in his debut, he made two of three extra points and his lone field goal, a 41-yarder.

Tight ends Dawson Knox and Dalton Kincaid, who sat out Wednesday’s walk through practice and Thursday’s full session but returned to limited status Friday, are both listed as questionable for the game.

Lewis, defensive back Taron Johnson, edge rusher Joey Bosa and linebacker Shaq Thompson were all limited in the first two practices but were full on Friday and do not have a game designation so they will play in the game. Thompson was unable to finish the game in Cleveland because of a neck injury.

Prescott was sacked six times, a season high, and hurried 11 times by the Commanders.
Asked if Prescott would play against the Giants, Dallas coach Brian Schottenheimer hedged slightly.
""Lot of pride, and I think that's another reason I want to play,"" he said.
""Again, we want to win,"" Schottenheimer said.","LANDOVER, Md. -- The Dallas Cowboys will miss the playoffs, but after Thursday's 30-23 win against the Washington Commanders, quarterback Dak Prescott reiterated he wants to play in next week's season finale at the New York Giants.

""I'll have some fight back,"" Prescott said. ""It depends on how it comes, what's the purpose, what's the reason. Obviously, I understand being approached about it, but the conversations we've already had about it are for me to play.""

Prescott was sacked six times, a season high, and hurried 11 times by the Commanders. For the first time this season, he failed to complete 60% of his passes, hitting 19 of 37 attempts for 307 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran four times for 24 yards.

Asked if Prescott would play against the Giants, Dallas coach Brian Schottenheimer hedged slightly.

""It's Christmas,"" Schottenheimer said. ""I'm going to enjoy Christmas, man. I'm going to have some eggnog. I'll deal with that when I get looking back to the film, but definitely some eggnog. And we're playing to win.""

With a victory against the Giants, the Cowboys would avoid posting a losing record in back-to-back campaigns for the first time since they suffered three straight 5-11 seasons from 2000 to 2002.

Prescott said there is a ""big difference"" between finishing 8-8-1 or 7-9-1.

""Lot of pride, and I think that's another reason I want to play,"" he said. ""In a season [of] me being healthy, I've never had, in all of my life, career, a season under .500. So that tie is going to come into play really well. So it's a huge difference. It's one of those things that, I mean, yeah, it's just pride. It's pride, honestly.""

Prescott went 8-8 as the starter in 2019. The two times he has played fewer than nine games, the Cowboys have gone 6-10 (2020) and 7-10 (2024). This will be the third season in which Prescott has started the majority of games and the Cowboys have not made the playoffs (2017, 2019).

Prescott said any conversations he has had with Schottenheimer since the Cowboys were eliminated from the postseason have been with the idea he would start.

""I love this game,"" Prescott said. ""I love any opportunity that I get to play it. So with that being said, yeah, if I get to go out there, I'm going to give my best. I'm going to prepare the same way. I'm going to be the same player.

""I understand the reasons why maybe not [to play], and if I'm approached with that, I'll handle it then.""

The downside is substantial if Prescott were to suffer an injury. He is set to count more than $74 million against the cap, although the Cowboys will restructure his deal to gain some cap space, with a $40 million base salary.

Schottenheimer said he did not like that Prescott was hit as much as he was by Washington.

""Again, we want to win,"" Schottenheimer said. ""We play to win. Eight-eight-and-one. Do the math; sounds way better than the alternative. But again, the other thing is, right now we're 4-1 in the division [NFC East]. This is a pretty good division. Historically, it's been one of the best in football, and you can see how physical the games are just by watching today's game.""

Prescott has won 14 straight games against the Giants, although the Cowboys needed a 64-yard field goal to force overtime in a Week 2 triumph. He has not lost to New York since 2016, his rookie season. He believes momentum can carry over to 2026 with victories.

""Winning helps everything,"" Prescott said. ""Just finishing off with a win, two of them, would be great for us.""

After Thursday's contest, Prescott wore a sweatshirt that read ""Wake up happy"" on the front.

""I'll wake up happy, for sure,"" he said, ""but I'll probably wake up a little sore too.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1210%2Fr1587837_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 14:03:02.968358

Lamar Jackson is listed as doubtful for Saturday's game against the Green Bay Packers with the back injury that sidelined him for the second half of last week's loss to the New England Patriots.

The Ravens announced Jackson's status on Thursday, listing him as doubtful after he didn't participate in practice for a third straight session since suffering the injury. Jackson's status leaves Tyler Huntley in position to make his second start of the season against Green Bay.

Ravens' outside shot at making playoffs

The Ravens enter Saturday's game as a long shot to make the playoffs at 7-8. But they have a chance. They need to win their last two games against the Packers and Steelers. They also need the 9-6 Steelers to lose their last two games against the Browns and them in order to overtake Pittsburgh for the AFC North title. The Ravens don't have a path to earning a wild-card bid.

If the Steelers beat the Browns on Sunday, the Ravens will be eliminated from the playoffs, and their season finale against Pittsburgh would be irrelevant. So the Ravens will obviously go into Saturday's game with everything to play for.

Beating a motivated Packers team that has an outside shot of winning the NFC North won't be easy if Jackson can't go. But the Packers are dealing with their own quarterback concerns.

Jordan Love, Malik Willis questionable for Packers

Jordan Love remains in concussion protocol with a concussion sustained in last week's loss to the Chicago Bears. The Packers listed him as questionable on Thursday. He'll need to pass protocol to be cleared to play against Baltimore.

His backup, Malik Willis, is also questionable with an undisclosed illness and a right shoulder injury. Willis returned to practice in a limited capacity on Thursday after missing Wednesday's session with the illness.

If neither quarterback can play, the Packers will likely be left to elevate Clayton Tune off the practice squad to start against the Ravens. Tune is a third-year pro who's thrown 23 NFL passes, just two of them since the 2023 season. He hasn't played in 2025.

The 9-5-1 Packers are in position to clinch a playoff berth and have an outside shot of overtaking the 11-4 Chicago Bears for the NFC North title if they win out and the Bears lose their remaining two games against the San Francisco 49ers and Detroit Lions.

He started wearing the safer Guardian Cap over his helmet when he returned from IR, but still suffered another concussion.

Kelly is a four-time Pro Bowler, but might not get another chance to earn those honors.

“A massive loss to the offensive line as Alex Forsyth will be the next man up for the Broncos,” Sleeper Broncos wrote on X.
“Center Luke Wattenberg has been placed on IR,” Broncos.com’s Alec DiLalla wrote on X.","The Denver Broncos suffered their first loss in 11 games with a Week 16 home defeat at the hands of the Jacksonville Jaguars.

The franchise caught a different kind of “L” just hours before their Christmas Day game against the Kansas City Chiefs when they announced center Luke Wattenberg was headed to the injured reserve with a shoulder injury, meaning he would miss at least 2 postseason games if he comes back this season.

That means Wattenberg could return for either the AFC Championship Game or the Super Bowl if the Broncos somehow get the No. 1 seed in the AFC Playoffs.

“The Broncos placed starting C Luke Wattenberg on IR today with a shoulder injury,” NFL Network’s Mike Garofolo wrote on X. “He’s out through the first two playoff games with an injury that’s still being evaluated to determine if he can return later in the postseason.”

Wattenberg signed a 4-year, $48 million contract extension on November 25 that made him one of the Top 10 highest paid players at his position in the NFL.

Alex Forsyth was set to start in Wattenberg’s place moving forward.

“The Broncos have placed center Luke Wattenberg on injured reserve with a shoulder injury, team announces,” The Denver Post’s Luca Evans wrote on X on Thursday, December 25. “Big blow at this point in the year. A lot on reserve Alex Forsyth’s shoulders. Started 4 games there last year. Calvin Throckmorton signed to 53-man as backup.”

“Per wire, Broncos placed starting center Luke Wattenberg on IR with shoulder injury,” Denver 9News reporter Mike Klis wrote on X. “A potential big blow. Alex Forsyth is up.”

Wattenberg Became One of NFL’s Elite in 2025

Wattenberg was a fifth round pick in the 2022 NFL draft out of the University of Washington and became the full-time starter for the first time in 2024, when he started all 13 games he played in but missed 4 games with an ankle injury

In 2025, he’d started all 15 games so far this season for the 12-3 Broncos before being placed on injured reserve. In his second year as the starter, the 6-foot-5, 300-pound Wattenberg has established himself as one of the NFL’s best at his position and has a 70.9 overall grade from Pro Football Focus this season.

“A massive loss to the offensive line as Alex Forsyth will be the next man up for the Broncos,” Sleeper Broncos wrote on X.

“Center Luke Wattenberg has been placed on IR,” Broncos.com’s Alec DiLalla wrote on X. “Had played all 1,005 of the Broncos’ offensive snaps to start the season.”

Forsyth Most Known for Mistake Against Chiefs

Forsyth is best known for making a mistake that cost the Broncos a win over the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium in Week 10 of the 2024 regular season.

Broncos quarterback Bo Nix drove the Broncos down the field in the final moments of the game to set up what could have been a 35-yard, game-winning field goal by Will Lutz as time expired.

Lamar Jackson has officially been listed as doubtful for Saturday with a back injury. He hasn't practiced all week and suffered the injury during last week's loss to the New England Patriots, leaving the game at halftime after an awkward slide in the second quarter. He was termed day-to-day earlier this week, but now appears likely to miss the Packers game.

Baltimore needs a win, or else the Pittsburgh Steelers will clinch the AFC North title with two games left to play.

The Ravens' opponent, meanwhile, has its own QB issues to sort out. Will it be Jordan Love or Malik Willis starting Saturday night? Or neither? That question is up in the air for now, as both quarterbacks are questionable ahead of Saturday's game as of Thursday.

[NFL injury updates live]

Love remains in concussion protocol with a concussion sustained in last week's loss to the Chicago Bears. The Packers listed him as questionable on Thursday. He'll need to pass concussion protocol to be cleared to play against Baltimore.

His backup, Willis, is also questionable with an undisclosed illness and a right shoulder injury. Willis returned to practice in a limited capacity on Thursday after missing Wednesday's session with the illness.

If neither quarterback can play, the Packers will likely be left to elevate Clayton Tune off the practice squad. Tune is a third-year pro who's thrown 23 NFL passes and has thrown just two passes since the 2023 season. He hasn't played in 2025.

Other notable Week 17 injuries:

The San Francisco 49ers got good news this week when it was reported that All-Pro tight end George Kittle avoided a high-ankle sprain during Monday night's win over the Indianapolis Colts. Kittle is reportedly dealing with a ""mid-to-low ankle sprain,"" which still leaves his status in doubt ahead of their Week 17 matchup with the Bears. But he's reportedly avoided the high-ankle sprain diagnosis that frequently comes with multi-week absences.

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen said that he “will be playing, planning on playing” against the Philadelphia Eagles this weekend. That came after he went down with a foot injury in last week's game, and the injury kept him out of Tuesday’s walk-through. “I mean, [it’s] still sore,” Allen said, via ESPN. “Walk-through today, so really not practice in general. So yeah … feeling good.”

TreVeyon Henderson and Kayshon Boutte remain in concussion protocol after both were injured during Sunday night's win over the Baltimore Ravens. Should Henderson be unable to go, running back Rhamondre Stevenson, who picked up 78 yards and a touchdown when he entered the game, will handle the workload.

The Colts are ""hopeful"" that Sauce Gardner will return this weekend against the Jaguars. The cornerback has missed three straight games due to a calf injury.

The 26-year-old has been absent since August after suffering a knee injury that required surgery. There had been some hope that he could return sooner, but Germany head coach Julian Naglesmann confirmed last month that he had suffered “a small relapse” on his road to recovery.

Havertz made his return to full training with the Arsenal squad ahead of their Carabao Cup quarter-final clash with Crystal Palace and Arteta said post-match that the forward was not far off being in contention for the game.

“Quite close,” Arteta said of Havertz’s return.

“I think it will be a matter of days if not weeks. Let’s see in the next stage how he responds to that.

“He’s a player that we’ve missed a lot. A player that brings the team into a different dimension. So, really happy to have him back soon.”

If it is a matter of days, then Havertz could return in Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Brighton & Hove Albion on December 27. Arteta’s side then play Aston Villa on December 30, before travelling to Bournemouth on January 3.

There may be a bit more of a wait for Gabriel to return though. The Brazilian centre-back has been out since November with a thigh problem, but Arteta confirmed that he has not yet returned to training.

“We have to wait and see again,” Arteta said. “He hasn’t trained yet. He’s stable in his rehab. But hopefully we get him back as soon as possible because we know the situation that we have in the backline.”

Ben White and Cristhian Mosquera are also longer-term absentees, while Piero Hincapie is an injury concern for Brighton after missing the victory over Palace with an injury sustained in Arsenal’s previous game against Everton.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/24055842/GettyImages-2253181852-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-26 11:04:14.150057

Remigio was a full participant in practice on Monday but had not practiced the past two days because of a knee injury. He joins the IR list alongside Rashee Rice and Tyquan Thornton, who were put there on Wednesday because they were still in the concussion protocol.

The Chiefs, who already are eliminated from playoff contention, also put top cornerbacks Trent McDuffie and Jaylen Watson on injured reserve this week. McDuffie has been dealing with a knee injury and Watson with a groin problem.

In a flurry of moves, the Chiefs signed linebacker Cole Christiansen, cornerback Melvin Smith and defensive ends Ethan Downs and Tyreke Smith to the active roster. Defensive back Nazeeh Johnson was activated from the IR, and wide receiver Jason Brownlee and offensive lineman Matt Waletzko were promoted from the practice squad.",https://www.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Chiefs-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-26 10:02:16.353455

Patrick Mahomes is among the latest stars to suffer season-ending injuries this campaign.

The 2024 NFL playoffs saw record-breaking overall viewership as the Philadelphia Eagles took down the Kansas City Chiefs, who were eyeing a three-peat.

But this year’s NFL playoffs will likely find it tough to get close to the same returns due to the number of injuries to star players.

Last weekend, Mahomes and Green Bay Packers pass rusher Micah Parsons each tore an ACL.

While the Mahomes injury is a brutal hit to the Chiefs and their future, they are out of the playoffs.

The Packers took a bigger hit with Parsons’ injury as they have Super Bowl aspirations.

Green Bay already lost tight end Tucker Kraft to a season-ending knee injury last month.

The NFL has a $1.5 billion-plus injury curse, as Mahomes, Parsons, Malik Nabers, Nick Bosa, Daniel Jones, Tyreek Hill, Michael Penix, Marshon Lattimore, and Zach Ertz, among others, have gone down with season-ending injuries at some points this season.

Roger Goodell‘s league will continue, and the NFL has been on a roll in terms of TV.

But the injuries to the top players and the absence of star quarterbacks could hurt media partners CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN, Prime Video, and Netflix for the upcoming playoffs.

Besides the loss of Mahomes, the NFL will be without top quarterbacks Joe Burrow and Jayden Daniels in the playoffs.

Burrow’s Bengals and Daniels’ Commanders are eliminated.

Washington also shut Daniels down for the season due to elbow injuries.

The two-time MVP Lamar Jackson and his Baltimore Ravens are also on the fence.

Sports TV ratings expert Douglas Pucci sees a ratings decline in the 2025 NFL playoffs, per Front Office Sports.

But Pucci is intrigued that Los Angeles and Chicago, the US’s second and third-biggest TV markets, are set to make the playoffs.",https://www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/12/crop-15650039_6dfbd8.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1,N,,2025-12-26 06:00:22.812225
