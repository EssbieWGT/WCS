The 32-year-old tight end said the support he has received since the injury has been “fantastic.”

“I've heard from a ton of people,” Kittle told reporters Monday. “Richard Sherman and Kirk Cousins reached out immediately after I got hurt and just said if I have any questions, hit them up.”

Both players mentioned by Kittle suffered the same injury.

Sherman suffered a torn Achilles in November 2017 in his last season with the Seattle Seahawks. He was released the following offseason and subsequently signed a three-year contract with the 49ers and was ready to play in Week 1 of the 2018 NFL season.

Cousins was injured in October 2023 in his last season with the Minnesota Vikings. He became a free agent after the season ended and then signed a four-year, $180 million contract with the Atlanta Falcons.

Kittle also received support from athletes outside of the NFL.

“I've had so many players hit me up about it,” Kittle explained. “Basketball players, like so many guys just, ‘Hey, what do you need? Let us know. This helped this worked for me in my recovery. This is the surgery that I did.’ ”

“So, it's kind of cool just to kind of bounce some ideas around some other people, and just the outpouring of love has been fantastic and has definitely raised my spirits.”

Kittle always seems to keep up the high spirits, but the additional support has surely helped in the face of one of the most devastating injuries an athlete can endure.",https://media.nbcsportsbayarea.com/2026/01/GEORGE-KITTLE-CART-USATSI.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-21 01:58:26.958398

Green Bay released the cornerback and announced the move among a batch of forward-facing roster changes that included a pair of futures contracts. Diggs is now subject to waivers. If he clears them, which is likely, he'll be a free agent.

A six-year NFL veteran, Diggs latched on with the Packers at the end of the 2025 regular season, starting in their finale at Minnesota and recording two tackles before playing one snap in Green Bay's Wild Card Weekend loss to Chicago.

Diggs made his way to Green Bay only after Dallas abruptly parted ways with the former All-Pro defender in late December in a move that was reportedly the culmination of multiple factors over time, including performance and other components. The decision came less than three years after the Cowboys signed Diggs to a five-year, $97 million extension that preceded a season-ending ACL injury in 2023 and a tumultuous journey that followed both on and off the field.

Diggs' contract -- a lucrative agreement that became a bloated one due to his lack of production -- already placed him on a track to be released after the 2025 season. Instead of waiting for the offseason, the Cowboys decided to cut ties in December, freeing Diggs to join a title-contending squad with the expectation he'd likely be released by his new team after their season ended.

Green Bay did exactly that on Tuesday, freeing up the entirety of the $15 million he was scheduled to account for in cap space in 2026. Diggs faces an uncertain future as heads to free agency, but will have a head start on finding a new home prior to the start of the new league year in March.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/nm94oj8kpxpfztwmegbh,N,,2026-01-21 01:58:31.822798

During their 33-30 victory over the Buffalo Bills, Bo Nix suffered a broken ankle in the final minutes of his first NFL playoff game, but Nix is maintaining his bold witness for Jesus Christ just like former Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow.

Nix and Tebow are the only quarterbacks drafted in Broncos franchise history to win playoff games, which last happened for Denver in 2011, according to Broncos Wire.

Outspoken about their Christian faith, Nix and Tebow also shone as quarterbacks in the SEC before arriving in Denver in the 2023 and 2010 NFL drafts, respectively.

Though not drafted by the Broncos, another courageous believer in Denver's winning history, quarterback Peyton Manning was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts before playing in the Mile High City.

With the mix of good and bad news about Nix following the win over the Bills, Tebow and Manning applaud him for leading the Broncos to the playoffs and are wishing him well during ankle surgery on Tuesday in Alabama.

The fracture ended a run to Super Bowl 60 for Nix.

Before hearing the bad news from Bronco's medical staff, Head Coach Sean Payton learned his second-year star quarterback had fractured his right ankle after Nix's wife, Izzy, posted a disheartening picture on social media.

""I snuck this picture because I wanted to remember this moment forever,"" Izzy wrote on Instagram. ""The joy, followed by the heartbreak, followed by watching each teammate and coach come to this little corner and sit by Bo's side. God could have placed us anywhere, and I'm so grateful He chose Denver. He is the perfect Author of Bo's story, and we cannot wait to see what He has in store for this team — We'll be on the front row, cheering the loudest!!!"" wrote Izzy Nix.

She also shared two Bible verses, including 2 Corinthians 4:16-17* which encourages followers of Jesus to persevere in faith and hope during suffering.

In the photo posted by Izzy Nix, her husband is on the floor with quarterbacks Jarrett Stidham and Sam Ehlinger; and Patrick Nix, the father of Bo.

Observing the scene and learning the news about the season-ending injury, Coach Payton returned to a post-game press conference broadcast live by CBS Colorado.

""He's such a strong faith-based guy. He was sitting in the hallway with his family, and I went over, and we were all talking to him, and he knows God has a plan for him,"" said Payton, who believes faith will carry him to recovery.

Payton announced that Stidham, the Broncos' No. 2 quarterback, will replace Nix in the AFC Championship Game against New England on Sunday.

The 25-year-old Nix passed for 279 yards and three touchdowns with one pick in the overtime victory over the Bills.

Asked before the game about advice from family members, Nix said his mother always offers the best. ""She wants me to stay healthy, go out there and have fun, stay humble, do the right things, and be a good leader for my teammates. I think sometimes parents can put it in perspective for you, just once in a while, let you know there's more out there than football,"" Nix said.

In mid-season, following the Broncos' 44-24 win over the Dallas Cowboys, Nix said playing for an audience of One is what inspires him.

""I feel like I'm in a great spot. Jesus has given me the ability to do what I'm passionate about. I'm really grateful for that. Salvation belongs to Him. I don't go around worrying about what other people think,"" Nix told The Gazette.

Before being drafted by the Broncos, Nix also played in Oregon after transferring from Auburn. As an Oregon Duck, Nix was also quick to give praise to Jesus for his team's victories.",https://cbn.com/sites/default/files/media/slider/images/ap26017776458420.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 21:59:25.802681

Is this the end of Golden State’s storied dynasty, the one that even Steve Kerr acknowledged recently was fading? The rest of us could see that much from the other side of the Bay Bridge for years now, but it was something altogether different for one of their leaders to actually say it. Yet as Kerr knows as well as anyone from his “Last Dance” Chicago Bulls days, there’s no graceful way to get out of the ring-collecting business.

Monday night was a brutal reminder.

To see Jimmy Butler limp off the Chase Center court after tearing his right ACL in the third quarter against his old Miami Heat team was to wonder where the Warriors go from here. The 36-year-old forward was Robin to Steph Curry’s Batman, a mercurial talent whose two-way play elevated their program and — if they squinted hard enough — made Warriors officials believe that they could still be title contenders. Yes, this season.

Even after the Warriors’ slow start, and with all the drama surrounding the Jonathan Kuminga situation that now gets even more interesting as the Feb. 5 trade deadline nears, there was still a sense in Warriors circles that this group would ultimately be capable of making real noise when the playoffs rolled around. They had Butler playing at an All-Star level again in recent weeks, with Golden State’s win 135-112 over Miami making it 12 wins in 16 games after they started just 13-15 (they’re in eighth place in the West — 1 1/2 games behind the Lakers for the sixth spot).

Veteran forward De’Anthony Melton had recently returned from … a torn ACL … to star in his role and provide a serious spark. The improved play of old-head Al Horford was another significant factor. They felt they could become true contenders if they managed to stay healthy when it mattered most. And all of these goals — per their organizational norm — were a way of honoring Curry and his greatness, which should never be taken for granted.

But this Butler injury changes everything. Will Kerr rely on Kuminga, the 23-year-old with whom he has struggled for so long? It’s nearly impossible to imagine a basketball world where Kuminga becomes the savior. No, this — the loss of a proud star in his late 30s who is in the first year of a two-year, $112 million extension that he was given upon arrival when the Warriors traded for him last February — just might be their death knell. Especially considering Butler had a meniscus tear in that same knee in 2018 (which required surgery) and an MCL sprain in 2024.

Consider this much, too: Even if Kuminga decides to play ball, so to speak, we’ve already seen the limits of that particular approach. He did his best in the Western Conference semifinals last postseason after a Game 1 hamstring injury ended Curry’s season. Kuminga averaged 24.3 points on 55.4 percent shooting in 31 minutes per game, and … the Warriors still lost in five games. That’s a cautionary tale if ever there was one.

What’s more, it’s worth noting that Kuminga was the only active Warriors player not to play against the Heat Monday, despite them being without Draymond Green, Melton and Butler (after his injury). That speaks volumes.

If nothing else, Kuminga should be motivated by the fact that his value is not what he or his agent, Aaron Turner, believed it to be. All indications are that the Sacramento Kings remain the only legitimate suitor for his services, and they lowered their offer recently (refusing to include a protected first-round pick) because of the Warriors’ sordid state of affairs.

You never know what might shake loose as the deadline nears, and it’s safe to assume that longtime owner Joe Lacob and general manager Mike Dunleavy will get even more aggressive in their pursuit of roster upgrades. But team sources say the phones are simply not ringing for Kuminga’s services at this point.

Here’s an idea to pass the time: Kuminga, who has every right to be frustrated by the way in which his Warriors situation has evolved, should compartmentalize all of that angst and prove his worth to the league in these coming weeks. After all, Golden State did give him a two-year, $48.5 million deal last summer, with a team option for next season and the overall impression that services would be rendered.

When Kerr was asked if Kuminga might finally see the floor in the wake of Butler’s injury, he said, “Absolutely.” He was then asked if he was ready.

“Yep, yep,” Kerr said.

Now is the time to deliver — so long as Kerr calls his number. Their almost-dead dynasty depends on it.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/20073813/USATSI_28042988-1-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-20 21:59:32.660405

Super Bowl odds barely budge

The Divisional Round didn’t change the Super Bowl odds board much, at least at the very top.

With four teams left, the Seahawks remain the favorites (+145, FanDuel Sportsbook) to win it all after they drubbed the 49ers.

After their win over the Bears, the Rams are still right behind Seattle (+210), followed by the Patriots (+240).

The biggest shift came in Denver after Bo Nix’s injury, which we will have more on here in a minute.

The Broncos now have, by far, the longest odds to hoist the Lombardi Trophy (+1300).

The Bo Nix effect

About that Bo Nix injury.

The Broncos quarterback shockingly went down with a broken ankle, ending his season with his team just two wins away from a Super Bowl title.

Oddsmakers, apparently, really don’t like the downgrade from Nix to backup Jarrett Stidham.

The Broncos went from a 1.5-point lookahead favorite before the news of Nix’s injury broke, shifting the odds in the Patriots’ favor despite having to travel to the Mile High City.

The line shifted to as high as -5.5 for New England as of Tuesday afternoon.

If that number holds, the Patriots would be the biggest road favorite during the conference championship round since the merger (1970).

But that was far from the only news on Tuesday.

General manager Joe Schoen spoke with the media following Harbaugh's press conference, where he provided updates on the injury status of wide receiver Malik Nabers and running back Cam Skattebo.

Nabers suffered a torn ACL during the team's Week 4 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, an injury that cost him the rest of the season. While Schoen wouldn't say anything definitively about the timetable for the young wideout's return, the general manager did say Nabers looks like he could be ready for the start of camp.

""Malik is trending to hopefully be ready for training camp,"" Schoen added. ""Things can change ... but that's the hope.""

The injury occurred with 6:12 left in the second quarter of Jaxson Dart's first career start under center. Nabers had two receptions for 20 yards on three targets up to that point.

In his four games, the young receiver totaled 18 receptions for 271 yards, including his explosive 167-yard, two-touchdown performance against the Cowboys in Week 2.

Nabers enjoyed a historic rookie campaign in 2024 as he set a new franchise single-season reception record on his way to being named to the Pro Bowl. He finished his rookie season with 109 receptions for 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns.

While Harbaugh said he has not had the chance to meet Nabers in person over the last week, the two were able to connect over the phone, where the 22-year-old made a strong first impression on his new head coach.

""I had a chance to talk to Malik on the phone,"" Harbaugh said after the press conference. ""It was great. He was training out in LA, rehabbing out there for a week or whatever it was and working hard. I just love talking to him. His joy and excitement, he had some really good ideas, he's really a thoughtful guy. Obviously, saw him coming out (of LSU). He wasn't a guy we had a chance for, so it was like, 'Well, look at this guy, he's really good.' Just kind of a dream. I figured we might have to cover him someday, and here we are, we get a chance to coach him. So I'm really excited about it.""

As for Skattebo, the young running back is on track to be ready for the start of the Giants' offseason workout program in the spring.

""He'll be fine,"" Schoen said about the 23-year-old running back. ""He'll actually be prepared for the offseason program on April 6th. He should be good.""

Skattebo suffered a dislocated ankle in Week 8 when the Giants were on the road in Philadelphia. The young back underwent successful surgery that night at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital Presbyterian campus and was discharged the next day.

""That's not even a question,"" Skattebo said after the season ended on whether or not he would return to 100 percent. ""I'm going to be back. I've played seven games in the NFL and I got hurt. There's a long road ahead. That is not going to stop me.""

In his limited action this past season, Skattebo ran the ball 101 times for 410 yards (4.1 avg.) and five touchdowns. He also played a big role in the passing game, catching 24 passes for 207 yards and another two scores.

Despite missing the second half of the season, Skattebo stayed around the team as he rehabbed his ankle, providing the sideline with the same energy he brought on the field prior to the injury.

""It sucked because you can't be out there to help,"" Skattebo told reporters on January 5. ""When you can't do something to make sure that your team is in a better position to win or you can't contribute at all other than having the energy on the sidelines and making sure the guys in the building have a positive mindset, it's hard to be in that situation. But I tried to take it as best as I could.""

A couple of weeks after his surgery, Skattebo made an appearance with some teammates on WWE 'Monday Night Raw' at Madison Square Garden. Skattebo had some back-and-forth banter during the skit, which led to him shoving wrestler JD McDonagh from behind a steel barrier and getting pushed back.

The appearance was all in fun and Skattebo was not actually put in harm's way. While Schoen did admit he would have preferred it if the injured back did not participate in the skit, the GM acknowledged that at the end of the day, Skatt is going to be Skatt.

""I was sitting on my couch at home, I had no idea what was going on and the agent called me,"" Schoen said about the WWE appearance. ""I would rather him not do that, but as you guys that have been around Skatt (know), that's just who he is.""

The running back certainly found his own ways to showcase his personality while injured. But he made it clear the day after the season ended that once he's healthy enough to get back on the field, the sole focus will turn back to football.

""Obviously, the main thing is football, so I'll get back to that when I'm ready to go. It's football from there on out,"" he said.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/giants/avw1lsgh3qoarwzli9qr,N,,2026-01-20 18:00:51.650996

He was joined on the PFWA All-Rookie team by defensive tackle Mason Graham.

Schwesinger was the No. 33 pick out of UCLA, where he began his career as a walk-on and started only one season. He immediately impressed Browns coaches and teammates and was inserted in the starting lineup. When veteran Jordan Hicks retired at the start of training camp, Schwesinger became the signal caller.

He started 16 games — he missed the finale with a quadriceps injury — and led NFL rookies with 146 tackles and 11 tackles for loss. The total tackles ranked eighth in the league. He added two interceptions, 2.5 sacks and three passes defensed.

He had double-digit tackles in seven games, including six straight, the longest streak in the league this season. The seven double-digit-tackle games were the most among rookies.

Myles Garrett voted All-NFL by Pro Football Writers of America for sixth straight season

He was the only linebacker in the league with at least 11 tackles for loss and two interceptions.

He was voted a Pro Bowl alternate.

“He’s playing at a really high level,” safety Grant Delpit said during the season. “And it’s no secret, everybody knows it.

“I saw it early, I ain’t going to lie. I saw early at camp, I think everybody saw. We knew that he was going to be around the ball a lot. He’s around that ball, so it’s inspiring. Makes everybody else want to make plays, too.”

Schwesinger played through a high ankle sprain throughout the second half of the season, earning even more respect from coaches and teammates.

“It’s really been an honor to coach that kid,” defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz, who’s a candidate for the head coaching job, said during the final week of the season. “It’s easy for me, but he’s done everything — and he’s played extremely tough, going back to the ankle sprain. But he’s been all over the injury report. He prepares the same, he goes out and plays effectively.

“And he’s been a good leader for us — he’s increased that as the season’s gone on, and I look forward to seeing him even take greater strides as a player. Really a cement block for our defense and I think Defensive Rookie of the Year.”

Graham was the No. 5 pick out of Michigan. He started all 17 games, compiling 48 tackles, including seven for loss, a half-sack, four quarterback hits and four passes defensed.

The Browns defense ranked fourth in the NFL in yards allowed and third in passing yards.

Running back Quinshon Judkins, the No. 36 pick out of Ohio State, was a strong candidate after rushing for 827 yards and seven touchdowns in 14 games, but New England’s TreVeyon Henderson and Las Vegas’ Ashton Jeanty were picked for the All-Rookie team.

This is where Bo Nix chose to rest, finally, on Jan. 17. Slumped with his arms across his chest on the floor, still in a crumpled Broncos jersey and his gameday eye black, with his left sock on and right sock off. Processing. A small group formed around him, growing and thinning in size, Nix’s wife, Izzy, capturing the moment and sharing it to Instagram. Quarterbacks coach Davis Webb took a seat against the wall next to him. QB3 Sam Ehlinger watched. QB2 Jarrett Stidham watched.

Eventually, as not pictured by Izzy Nix, 315-pound right tackle Mike McGlinchey wandered over and sat next to his quarterback, too.

“I think he was made to handle things like this,"" McGlinchey told reporters Monday. ""He’s as tough as they come. And he’ll be back better than ever, when it’s all said and done.”

It hurts, McGlinchey reflected. Nix's season was done in the snap of an ankle bone, a freefall off an emotional mountaintop after leading the Broncos to a 33-30 overtime win over Buffalo in the AFC divisional round Saturday. Nix and McGlinchey are close. So are wives Izzy and Brooke. McGlinchey has texted Nix a ""bunch"" in the two days since, the tackle said.

But there is no time to mourn. The AFC's No. 2-seeded New England Patriots and MVP candidate Drake Maye loom on the immediate horizon. This Broncos locker room finds itself in the strangest of all places -- the future of the franchise suddenly ripped away, and having to step into an immediate future without him.

“I wouldn’t say it’s just another test, right,"" McGlinchey said. ""Like, you don’t ever say that about guys getting hurt. I think, especially when it’s the leader and the quarterback of your team, there’s a little bit more nuance to that.

""But certainly, we are a team that’s been battle-tested.”

The next test: to coalesce around the locker closest to the trainer's room, the one the 29-year-old Stidham calls home. Game-planning for New England without Nix will be tough. Adjusting Sean Payton's offense to Stidham's strengths in one week will be tough. But as both McGlinchey and defensive tackle Zach Allen indicated Monday, rallying around career backup Stidham is a fairly easy task.

""I have no doubts that he’s going to go out there and play his butt off,"" McGlinchey said Monday. ""And I think our team is in a perfect position with Stiddy moving forward, and we’re lucky to have him.

""And we’re lucky that our team, and our coaching staff and our front office, invests in every situation that could possibly come up on a football field, because not everybody has a quarterback waiting in the wings as talented as Jarrett.”

Stidham, as McGlinchey said, has been waiting for a moment like Sunday ""the entirety of his career."" He waited behind Tom Brady in his final year in New England -- and Stidham's rookie year -- in 2019. He lost a quarterback battle to Cam Newton in 2020. He played insurance for Derek Carr in Las Vegas in 2022. He lost a quarterback battle to Nix in Denver in 2024. Six years have come and gone with only four NFL starts to show for it.

And yet the man's made good money for good reason. He signed in Denver for two years and $10 million in 2023 to back up Russell Wilson, and signed for two years and $12 million this past offseason to back up Nix. Multiple Broncos sources have expressed clear conviction in Stidham to The Denver Post, a feeling outwardly shared by players.

""He’s like a second quarterback coach out there,"" Allen said. ""And on top of it, too, he can make every single throw.”

""He’s more prepared than anybody would be in this situation,"" McGlinchey said. ""And he can ball. Like, he can flat-out play quarterback. And we’ve seen it every single day of practice.""

Will this be an easy transition in pure Xs and Os? No. Payton made clear Monday that Nix takes the majority of reps on any given work week, with limited game-feel situations for Stidham.

Still, they will ride behind his No. 8 jersey, because there is currently no other option.

“He’ll be ready to go,"" Payton said Monday, ""and ready for the moment.”",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tdp-z-refer-02_64c2d5.jpg?w=1024&h=691,N,,2026-01-20 18:00:56.659358

After suffering multiple injuries at wide receiver, the Denver Broncos are bringing back a familiar face ahead of the AFC Championship game.

The Broncos are signing receiver Brandon Johnson to their practice squad, KUSA-TV's Mike Klis first reported on Tuesday. Denver will need to make a corresponding move to make room for Johnson.

Johnson (6-2, 195 pounds) originally entered the league with the Broncos as an undrafted free agent out of UCF in 2022. After hauling in six receptions for 42 yards and one touchdown in seven appearances as a rookie, Johnson's role expanded under new coach Sean Payton in 2023 as he totaled 19 catches for 284 yards and four touchdowns in 13 games.

Johnson failed to make Denver's 53-man roster following training camp in 2024 and he landed on the Pittsburgh Steelers' practice squad. He made three appearances that season, grabbing one catch for nine yards. After being cut by the Steelers in August, Johnson spent most of the 2025 season on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' practice squad.

After being cut by the Bucs in December, Johnson returned to Pittsburgh's practice squad. Because he was not on an active roster at the end of the Steelers' season, Johnson was eligible to join the Broncos after his practice squad contract expired in Pittsburgh.

Pat Bryant suffered his second concussion in less than a month during Saturday's divisional round win over the Buffalo Bills and Troy Franklin left the game with a hamstring injury. Following those injuries, the Broncos were down to three healthy WRs on the active roster: Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims and Lil'Jordan Humphrey.

The San Francisco 49ers tight end knew immediately he’d torn his right Achilles tendon after making a 6-yard catch midway through the second quarter. Kittle said it “felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger.”

Despite the early end to his season and a months-long rehabilitation ahead, Kittle was his usual jokey, upbeat self after pushing his knee scooter to the middle of a media scrum on locker clean-out day Monday.

He said his tear was a best-case scenario, one that occurred higher up on the tendon near the soleus muscle, where there’s better blood flow and thus the chance for a faster-than-normal recovery.

“I had a clean tear,” he said, “They didn’t have to drill into my heel. And where the repair was, there’s more blood flow. So it takes some time off the recovery time.”

Kittle declined to give a specific timeline, but a quick recovery from an Achilles tear has traditionally been around eight months, which would put him in play for the start of the regular season.

Some NFL Achilles patients come back even faster than that. Former 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree, for example, returned in six months. One-time Los Angeles Rams runner Cam Akers’ recovery took five and a half months.

“It puts me in a really good mood,” Kittle said. “It’s not as bad as other ones.”

Another top-end player feeling optimistic about his recovery was Fred Warner.

The linebacker said last week’s well-reported return to the practice field went very well, so much so that he was confident he’d have been able to play in this Sunday’s NFC Championship Game had the 49ers won Saturday.

“Which gives me the ultimate confidence going forward into the offseason, to just attack things as hard as I can,” he said. “Because there are no limitations.”

Warner said he didn’t need any follow-up surgeries on his ankle, which he broke and dislocated on Oct. 12, and that he’d continue to rehabilitate the muscles around the ankle, albeit at a more moderate pace than last week.

“I think my rehab got super-accelerated to try to make that NFC Championship Game, so now I get to kind of slow things down and just really just work on all the little things that I didn’t get to work on before all this happened,” he said.

Quarterback Brock Purdy also said he wouldn’t need any procedures on the turf toe injury that caused him to miss eight games in 2025, declaring the toe “good to go.” Even defensive end Mykel Williams, who tore his ACL as well as his lateral meniscus on Nov. 2, was optimistic about being ready for the regular season, saying Monday he “should” be back in time for the start of training camp.

The first-round draft pick said he’s been leaning on advice from position mate Nick Bosa, who tore his ACL six weeks earlier, the third time he’s had such an injury.

“Because he’s been through it,” Williams said. “He knows exactly what it feels like and how to move.”

Kittle, meanwhile, said he’s been buoyed by all the well-wishers who contacted him after his injury. That group includes quarterback Kirk Cousins and former cornerback Richard Sherman as well as Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton, who tore his Achilles in June in Game 7 of the NBA Finals.

Kittle, a massive wrestling fan, said he also fielded a call from former wrestler Bill Goldberg.

“That was a cool experience for me,” Kittle said.

Odds and ends

• Receiver Jauan Jennings, who’s scheduled to hit free agency, became nostalgic when asked about the prospect of signing with another team.

“(When) I first flew in here, I was thinking I was going to San Francisco just like everybody else,” he said. “And then you find out fast it’s Santa Clara. Now it’s home. It quickly turned into home, and a run I’ll never forget for sure.”

Jennings led the 49ers’ wide receivers in receiving yards (643) and receiving touchdowns (nine) this season.

• Defensive coordinator Robert Saleh interviewed in-person for the Tennessee Titans’ head coach job Monday and by late Monday evening was finalizing a deal to become their next head coach. With Saleh leaving, his heir apparent appears to be his mentor, Gus Bradley, who served as assistant head coach for the 49ers this season and who had a prominent role as storyteller at the day-before-game team meetings in 2025.

“For years, I heard Saleh telling those same stories,” Warner said. “(Bradley’s) been doing it for such a long time, and he’s been great to have.”

• Christian McCaffrey, who led the NFL in touches and was second in yards from scrimmage, won both the 49ers’ Len Eshmont and Bill Walsh awards. Both are de facto team MVP awards, with the Eshmont being voted on by players and the Walsh by coaches.

The Bobb McKittrick Award, given to the most courageous offensive lineman, went to Colton McKivitz, while the Hazeltine Iron Man Award, for the most inspirational defensive player, went to linebacker Dee Winters.

Seahawks lose RB Charbonnet to ‘significant’ knee injury

If he’s able to return, Holani would provide some much-needed running back depth for the Seahawks, who will be without second-leading rusher Zach Charbonnet for the rest of their playoff run. Charbonnet tore his ACL in the second quarter of Seattle’s 41-6 rout of the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Divisional Round on Saturday night.

Holani has been on injured reserve since Nov. 29 after suffering a hamstring injury in Seattle’s Week 12 win over the Tennessee Titans.

“George is an option, yeah,” Macdonald said. “We’ll see how it goes this week.”

Prior to his injury, Holani spent the first 11 games of the season as Seattle’s third-string running back behind Kenneth Walker III and Charbonnet.

An undrafted second-year pro out of Boise State, Holani rushed for 73 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries this season, while adding two catches for 15 yards. He also had 16 kick returns for 387 yards.

Walker and Charbonnet spent the season as a formidable one-two punch in Seattle’s backfield. Walker rushed for a team-high 1,027 yards and five touchdowns, while Charbonnet ran for 730 yards and a team-high 12 TDs.

How Zach Charbonnet’s injury impacts the Seahawks

Walker is currently the only healthy running back on Seattle’s 53-man roster. However, the Seahawks also have fourth-year pro Velus Jones Jr. and sixth-year pro Cam Akers on their practice squad.

Jones was elevated from the practice squad for Saturday night’s divisional round game and rushed for 10 yards on six carries after Charbonnet went down. Jones, who signed with Seattle’s practice squad midway through the season, ran for 32 yards on four carries in three regular-season games.

Akers signed with the Seahawks in late-November after getting released by the Minnesota Vikings. He spent his first three-plus seasons with the Rams, finishing as their leading rusher in both 2020 and 2022. He has no carries with Seattle this season, but had two kick returns for 54 yards in a Week 17 win over the Carolina Panthers.

Here are three betting storylines for the NFL’s final four, with odds from BetMGM:

How Bo Nix’s injury affected the line

It’s impossible to discuss the AFC championship game without a dive into the Broncos’ quarterback conundrum.

Broncos coach Sean Payton shocked everyone with the announcement that Bo Nix would undergo season-ending surgery, meaning Jarrett Stidham would start the AFC championship game. Stidham will set the record for fewest career starts (four) of any starting quarterback in NFL conference championship game history.

There was a huge adjustment to the line. On lookahead lines for potential matchups last week, the Broncos were a 1.5-point favorite over the Patriots. That moved all the way to Patriots -5.5, but it has come back to Patriots -5 at BetMGM. The Broncos could close as the biggest home underdog in NFL conference championship game history.

Before the season, 12 oddsmakers broke down the point-spread difference between starting quarterback and backup quarterback for each team to Yahoo Sports’ Ben Fawkes, and the average difference from Nix and Stidham was 3.85 points. The line actually moved 6.5 points, based on that lookahead line, which seems like an overreaction.

Seahawks favored over Rams

The NFC championship game is the third meeting between the Seahawks and Rams this season, which means we have point spread history for two other games.

In the first meeting in Los Angeles, the Rams were 3-point favorites and won but didn’t cover, outlasting Seattle 21-19 when the Seahawks missed a long field goal as time expired. In the second game, the Seahawks were 1.5-point favorites and trailed by 16 points in the fourth quarter before coming back to win but not cover in a wild 38-37 win.

The line this time has moved the Seahawks’ way, even though their win over the Rams was fluky with a historic comeback. Seattle is -2.5 at -120 odds, which means it could move to Seahawks -3 before kickoff. The Seahawks’ rest over the last two weeks, with a bye followed by a blowout win over the 49ers, might factor in. The Rams’ wild-card game came down to the final minute and then the divisional round game at Chicago went to overtime. The Seahawks have also looked impressive in the three games since that comeback over the Rams, while Los Angeles hasn’t played a great game since then.

Both of these teams have been good to bettors. The Seahawks and Rams both went 12-5 against the spread this regular season, in a four-way tie for the best ATS record in the NFL, according to Action Network (the Patriots and Jaguars were the others).

NFC likely to be favored in Super Bowl

As has been the case for weeks, the two NFC West teams are atop the Super Bowl odds. No matter which NFC team wins Sunday, they’re very likely to be favored in Super Bowl LX.

The Broncos’ quarterback situation has also affected the current Super Bowl odds:

Seahawks +150

Rams +220

Patriots +250

Broncos +1300

It is a bit jarring to see Jarrett Stidham at +2000 to win Super Bowl MVP, considering he hasn’t thrown a pass in either of the last two regular seasons and wasn’t on anyone’s radar just a few days ago.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ka9F2ozaNnuwHPPfDfelmw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/d2cfc31a-7baf-425a-b863-cd18e2e05e94,N,,2026-01-20 17:00:53.027078

Fernando Mendoza, born in Miami and the grandson of Cuban immigrants, chose a different path: American football – a decision that has carried him to the top of college football and positioned him as the leading candidate to be the No. 1 pick in next year’s NFL Draft.

The quarterback for theIndiana Hoosiersled his team to an undefeated season and the national championship after beating theMiami Hurricanes. He also claimed theHeisman Trophy, given to the best player in college football. Mendoza finished the regular season with 2,980 passing yards, 33 touchdown passes and six interceptions.

Although he has lived his entire life in the United States, Mendoza is proud of his Cuban roots through his grandparents, who taught him the value of perseverance and hard work – principles he applies every day. He says he admires Cuba’s sporting tradition in other disciplines, but wants to inspire island communities to embrace American football as well.

“My idea was to be able to broaden the horizon and show different Cuban communities that it’s not only about boxing and baseball – sports we excel in and that I love,” he said in an interview with CNN. “I really enjoy watching those sports, but we can also play football and any other discipline we choose.”

History with the Heisman

By winning the Heisman, Mendoza matched Jim Plunkett, who has Mexican roots, as the only Latino players to have captured college football’s most prestigious individual award. “It’s definitely a huge honor to be part of the conversation, especially alongside so many great players from the past and great players in the conversation now,”he said. “I’ve always trusted my team and myself. Now I’m just trying to take it one game at a time, one practice at a time, so I have a clear vision to reach my biggest goals.”

Finally, in his acceptance speech, Mendoza paid tribute to his family, singling out his grandparents. “For the love and sacrifice of my parents and grandparents – I love you so much. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.”

Kittle spoke to the media on Monday, Jan. 19, as the 49ers cleaned out their lockers. Here's what he had to say about his injury

George Kittle injury update

No additional tests were required for the 32-year-old to learn the extent of his injury, as Kittle said he knew right away after hitting the turf in the Eagles-49ers game that it was an Achilles tear.

""It felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger,"" he said. ""The second it happened, I knew exactly what it was. A Philadelphia trainer came down, a very nice guy, and said, 'What do you need?' I was like, 'I need a cart. [I'm] not gonna be able to walk this one off.'""

He also confirmed the rumor that he had a bottle of Patrón tequila sent to him by the 49ers' owner, Jed York, while he was in the locker room with medical staff.

""I did have both my parents and my wife in there too, so it's not like I was alone,"" he joked. ""I had supporters.""

Renowned surgeon Dr. Neal ElAttrache performed surgery on Kittle's Achilles in Los Angeles shortly after the Eagles game. Kittle said he was told the best-case scenario for an Achilles tear is that it occurs high near the soleus muscle, which is what happened in his case.

""Surgery went really, really good,"" Kittle said. ""I had a clean tear. They didn't have to drill into my heel, and where the repair was is where there's more blood flow, and so it takes some time off the recovery time. [ElAttrache] is really excited about my recovery... that puts me in a really good mood. It's not as bad as other ones.""

Kittle did not provide a timeline for his return, wishing to ""keep it as a surprise"" instead. He did not rule out a return in 2026, though, and ESPN reported Kittle saying he could be back out on the field ""well before November.""

For a professional athlete, recovery time for a torn Achilles tendon is typically 8-12 months.

Kittle finished his 2025 season with 58 receptions, 634 yards and seven touchdowns during 12 games during the regular season and playoffs.

The former Hawkeye dealt with a string of lower-body injuries during the regular season that left him out of action for more than a month. Despite missing time, he was still named to his seventh Pro-Powl in 2025.

His painful-looking collapse in the third quarter of Golden State's win Monday night over the visiting Miami Heat was caused by the sudden kerplosion of his right ACL, a crisis that will require surgery and then many months of recovery. This stinks for Butler, who is now facing the most serious injury of his career during his age-36 season. Butler delivers and takes beatings, a consequence of his particular style of basketball, which aesthetically certainly is not for everyone. You have to grade durability on a curve: LaMelo Ball will miss 15 to 40 games per campaign due to having papier-maché ankles; Butler, meanwhile, played a solid majority of his team's games every season for 13 years despite deploying his own tender body every night as a bulldozer, a forklift, a wrecking ball, an excavator, a railway stopblock, and a grenade. That he made it this long without any ligaments shredding catastrophically should be a real point of pride.

Lately he'd been cooking pretty good, and the Warriors had won 12 of 16 games to climb up to eighth in the Western Conference, a season-best six games over .500. Even with Butler, the Warriors are desperately cramped for offensive space and reliable shot-creation. Of the players who have played at least half of Golden State's games this season, only Butler and Stephen Curry have posted usage rates over 20 percent, which does not seem like it should be possible and in any case cannot have been sustainable, not when those two players have a combined age of 73 years old. The next most engaged Warriors regular by usage, after Butler, is veteran DeAnthony Melton, who is working his way into form after missing the first month of the season while recovering from his own ACL injury; the next most engaged guy is reserve guard Pat Spencer, who despite Steve Kerr's sweaty insistence to the contrary is 100 percent not ""that motherfucker."" Across Golden State's last 11 games Spencer has scored a grand total of three points.

It would sure be a luxury if the Warriors had another talented scorer in reserve, preferably someone with the floor skills and in-between game to handle some of Butler's bruising creation duties, and the size to hold up at all when assigned to defend opposing swingmen. Unfortunately, such players nowadays cannot be had for less than, say, $22.5 million per season, an expenditure that would push a team with Golden State's other salary commitments deep into the luxury tax. Obviously you cannot expect the Warriors—a tax-repeater, and thus subject to an onerous tax multiplier— to have splurged on such a thing, and thus to now be on the hook for an estimated tax bill for this season of more than $81 million. Obviously, had they made such a bold commitment, the player would already be in Kerr's rotation, spelling Butler, absorbing an important share of the offense, and pushing washed-up bozo Buddy Hield to the very end of the bench. Especially if that player were just 23 years old, in good health, had cost the team a valuable lottery pick, and had averaged 21 points per game across the team's most recent playoff series. Frankly, I don't even know why we are still talking about this!

Ahem. Now that I have reclaimed my laptop, in a shockingly violent confrontation, from the clutches of Golden State's head coach, this blog is allowed to acknowledge the existence of Jonathan Kuminga, recently stranded in basketball purgatory. Kuminga—23 years old, healthy, acquired via the seventh pick in the 2021 NBA draft, and recently signed to an expensive two-year contract—fell out of Kerr's rotation back in November and has not touched the court once since Dec. 18. In late October, Kerr was up there gassing up Kuminga's development and affirming his security as a starter after an encouraging win; two weeks later Kuminga had devolved into a radioactive clump of dog turds, and could not be allowed to approach the court except in disaster scenarios. Kerr can't stand Kuminga, and Kuminga is a clunky fit with the team's ancient core, and the relationship is now so rotten that Kerr would rather dish opportunities at the likes of Will Richard and Gui Santos than give any burn at all to a guy who performed heroically for his team in a by-God playoff series just eight months ago.

The situation could not be much more awkward without one or both men having bits of spinach conspicuously lodged in their teeth. Kuminga, as a recent free-agent signing, did not become eligible for a trade until Jan. 15; that same day, he or his agents demanded that he be traded, and leaked the demand to Shams Charania of ESPN. Charania reported that everyone in the organization, including Kuminga's teammates, agreed that he should be shipped out immediately. Not even five full days later, Kerr wakes up in a scenario where he cannot continue Kuminga's exile, if for no other reason than because he otherwise lacks the human bodies necessary to fill out an NBA-grade rotation. As recently as yesterday afternoon, Kuminga was a distressed surplus asset with ruined trade value; today he is by default the second-best offensive player on a team that opened the weekend with perfectly credible playoff aspirations.",https://lede-admin.defector.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2026/01/GettyImages-2256616585.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 18:01:00.962419

Dobbins to return from injured reserve on Monday, according to the NFL's transaction wire. He is now eligible to practice this week and, if cleared, can be activated from IR. View our original post below.

This is huge.

The Denver Broncos are opening the practice window for running back J.K. Dobbins this week, ESPN's Adam Schefter first reported on Monday. The Broncos are expected to return to the practice field on Wednesday, and if Dobbins practices, it will open his 21-day window to be activated to the 53-man roster.

Dobbins suffered a Lisfranc injury in November and landed on injured reserve. Initial reports indicated that a potential Super Bowl return would be a best-case scenario for Dobbins, but coach Sean Payton (and the running back himself) hinted leading up to Week 18 that Dobbins might be able to return for the AFC Championship game, if the team made it that far.

Denver has since advanced to host the New England Patriots in the AFC title game on Jan. 25, but they will be without starting quarterback Bo Nix, who suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the divisional round. The Broncos are now set to start backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham, and getting Dobbins back would provide a huge boost to the offense.

The 27-year-old running back totaled 809 yards from scrimmage and scored four touchdowns in ten games before his foot injury. Dobbins was averaging 5.0 yards per carry before the injury and rookie RJ Harvey has only managed 3.3, 1.9, and 3.1 YPC over the last three games.

If the Broncos are going to activate Dobbins from IR in time for the Patriots game, a decision will have to be made by Saturday afternoon. Denver's considered a home underdog going into the AFC championship.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/12/SBRC/88144709007-broncos-on-injured-reserve.jpg?crop=8191,4609,x0,y427&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-20 19:03:36.431086

This was the kind of performance that made you think the Seahawks are destined to win the Super Bowl.
Though they were far from spectacular in their win over Houston, the Patriots nonetheless find themselves one game from the Super Bowl again.
Then again, neither was the Patriots squad that shocked the Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI with Mike Vrabel as a player.
Instead, it’s another season falling short of a Super Bowl title -- and it cost Sean McDermott his job.","Three of the top four seeds advanced to Championship Sunday in a playoff field that was said to be as wide open as any in memory.

The Divisional Round treated us to the good, the bad and the ugly, and the latter even applies to the team hosting the AFC Championship Game. Bo Nix's shocking ankle injury has completely shredded the Broncos' script. The question now, in historical terms, is whether this will be a Nick Foles-like ending ... or similar to Josh Johnson replacing an injured Brock Purdy in a 49ers slaughter at the hands of the Eagles?

The Super Bowl-winning QB could be one of the two MVP front-runners -- Drake Maye or Matthew Stafford -- or it could be backup Jarrett Stidham or the oft-maligned Sam Darnold. To Darnold's credit, he has stacked two very good years together, he just played through a likely painful oblique injury and he now captains an extremely dangerous Seahawks squad that has emerged -- somewhat similarly to last season's Eagles -- as the team to beat.

Don't say we didn't warn you. Seattle has topped these rankings since its Week 16 win over the Rams. If the 'Hawks can repeat that, they'll make their first Super Bowl appearance in more than a decade.

This was the kind of performance that made you think the Seahawks are destined to win the Super Bowl. That obviously remains to be seen, but Sam Darnold and his injured oblique were not even asked to do that much, and Seattle still had a three-score lead by halftime. The 'Hawks dominated from the opening kickoff return, which allowed their pass rushers to torment Brock Purdy and the 49ers all game long. Kenneth Walker III looked fresh as a daisy, rushing for a season-high 116 yards and three touchdowns, though Seattle lost complementary back Zach Charbonnet to a torn ACL. On a more positive note, it appears Charles Cross (foot) avoided serious injury, with Mike Macdonald calling the left tackle day-to-day. All in all, the Seahawks clearly are the favorites right now, given the way they're playing, although they are about to face the one team that might be able to get them, if their first two showdowns with the Rams are any indication. The initial bout resulted in a two-point L.A. win, while the second showdown went Seattle's way on a two-point conversion in overtime. Buckle up for what could be a classic rubber match.

Though they were far from spectacular in their win over Houston, the Patriots nonetheless find themselves one game from the Super Bowl again. Their defensive performance on Sunday gets as much credit as (if not more credit than) the offensive effort, and now they are the favorites in the AFC title match vs. the Bo Nix-less Broncos. You can talk about the Pats' ""easy"" path, and it's worth mentioning the breaks they've caught in terms of their schedule and opponents' injuries; it's all accurate. This is not a juggernaut. Then again, neither was the Patriots squad that shocked the Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI with Mike Vrabel as a player. Today, the coach and Drake Maye have turned this into a team that believes in itself. Amazingly, the pressure is squarely on the AFC upstarts, who are suddenly in line to face Denver backup Jarrett Stidham , a former New England second-stringer who threw 48 forgettable passes for the Pats back in the day. Maye and his pass protection have to be better than they were against the Texans, but this is now viewed as their game to win, even if it will take place in a stadium that has been historically wicked to New England.

The Rams won a road playoff game in overtime despite their offensive-whiz coach and MVP front-runner quarterback having the kind of night that inspired them to deliver quotes like ""I have to be better for our group, I will be better for our group"" (Sean McVay) and ""Obviously, I can be better"" ( Matthew Stafford ). Still, Stafford hit on enough big throws when they counted, finishing the job after Los Angeles' defense made the key takeaway in overtime. And McVay finally turned to the run game, handing off 19 times in the fourth quarter and overtime after ignoring the ground attack for most of the first three quarters. Now, L.A. gets a chance at redemption after the painful loss at Seattle in Week 16, which tilted the NFC West and the conference's top seed in the Seahawks' direction. That game came down to just a few missed plays by the Rams, including Harrison Mevis ' errant 48-yard field goal attempt late in the fourth quarter. It was his only miss so far this season, and his game-winner in Chicago set up the showdown that felt inevitable. The Rams might be underdogs, but they looked like the best team in football at one point this season, and they have a chance to be that again.

Bo Nix 's broken ankle has to be one of the cruelest injuries in recent memory. Nix and the Broncos started hot in Saturday's game against the Bills, went into a lull, then engineered go-ahead and game-winning drives in the fourth quarter and overtime in a terrific showing. Sean Payton showed trust in his young quarterback, and Nix delivered. Now, with Nix done for the season, it'll be Jarrett Stidham , who hasn't attempted a regular-season pass in two years and who has never played in a playoff game before. And at center, Denver could be down to its third-stringer, depending on the health of Alex Forsyth , who suffered an ankle injury of his own. I can't wait for Payton to lay it on thick all week with the disrespect card, and I also can't wait to see what kind of offensive plan he cooks up against a Patriots defense that has come to play in two postseason games so far. It might take a special effort by Denver's defense, which has been very good all season, to beat Drake Maye, but it's an assignment this unit can carry out on its best pass-rush day.

This was supposed to be the season Josh Allen got it done, with Patrick Mahomes , Lamar Jackson and Joe Burrow unable to hurt the Bills in the playoffs. Instead, it’s another season falling short of a Super Bowl title -- and it cost Sean McDermott his job. The Bills didn’t punt once in their overtime loss at Denver. Everything was either a touchdown, field goal or turnover. There were five of the latter, and only one turnover for the Broncos, which ultimately did Buffalo in. You can talk about non-catches and shaky penalties until you’re royal blue in the face, but the giveaways were killers. James Cook’s fumble was a huge early turning point, and Allen’s two fumbles led to six painful Denver points. The Bills rang up 449 yards of offense and went 10-for-15 on third downs, 1-for-1 on fourth down and 3-for-5 in the red zone -- and they still lost. The late flags were also hard to ignore. After only 15 penalty yards in the game’s first 54-plus minutes, the Bills drew four flags in the final six snaps of the game, costing them 53 yards. This was a game the Bills could have -- perhaps should have -- won, and that’s why Buffalo will have a new coach in 2026.

C.J. Stroud followed up his five-fumble game against the Steelers with a four-interception first half against the Patriots, and we’re left to wonder if the quarterback who looked so precocious as a rookie will ever return to that form. He’s played below that level in the two seasons since, reaching a new low with the two recent playoff games, and the timing couldn’t be worse. The summer following a first-round QB’s third campaign is typically when contract-extension talks begin. Is Houston ready to lock up Stroud at more than $45 million per year? That’s a big commitment for a quarterback seemingly going in the wrong direction. The Texans’ world-class defense gives them a shot to be title contenders, and Stroud can’t be blamed for the lack of offensive options, with all the injuries that hit late in the season and at New England. But Houston has to know that Stroud can reverse this trend before feeling too good about making a significant financial commitment at the game’s most important position.

The Bears couldn’t go down without giving the Solder Field crowd one more heart-stopper, with Caleb Williams slinging his fourth-down miracle to Cole Kmet . But their magic ran out in overtime with Williams’ third pick -- a play heavily dissected for DJ Moore ’s route, too -- and not enough stops on defense. The Bears were clearly a flawed team, but also one brimming with self-belief and clutch playmaking ability, and they milked it to the last drop. There’s obviously a bright future in Chicago with Ben Johnson and Williams and the rest of the crew, but there’s also work needed to make this team a true Super Bowl contender. Chicago’s defense turned in a valiant effort in the Rams loss, but that’s the unit I would be seeking to upgrade first this offseason, even with a few lingering offensive issues. I can’t wait to see what the Bears do to try to address it, but I am also realistic about the idea that progress is rarely linear. That's very important context to keep in mind, especially for a team so wholly dependent on defensive takeaways and late-game heroics.

The season ended with a giant thud, with the last bollards collapsing under the weight of injuries and shortcomings against a superior Seahawks squad. We know about all the defensive losses the 49ers had suffered en route to the Divisional Round, and then the offense was served a dose of pain with George Kittle already out and Christian McCaffrey and Jake Tonges barely making it through the loss. Kyle Shanahan did nothing short of a masterful job with this team amid all the chaos. His job might not be any easier next season, with stellar DC Robert Saleh taking the Titans' head-coaching job, and the Niners have to figure out how to avoid the wave of injuries that seems to cripple them every year. Brock Purdy showed some stuff this season, but he naturally remains at his best with a strong group around him. With only decent salary cap space and limited draft resources, can San Francisco make enough foundational improvements to help the quarterback and team as a whole?",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/jbf56eaxtqzitwhtdlxt,N,,2026-01-20 15:00:26.559140

Nix is hoping to be ready for Week 1 next season. But that was unknown immediately after the game, and may have offered little to no consolation in the moment.

Nix suffered the injury on the Broncos’ third-to-last play before Wil Lutz’s game-winning field goal against the Bills. He finished the game. Nix also participated in an on-field interview after helping the Broncos reach their first AFC Championship Game since 2015.

Izzy, Nix’s father, Patrick, and Broncos QBs Jarrett Stidham and Sam Ehlinger were there.

Still, Nix sat on the floor in a hallway, his back against a wall. The posture both fit and underscored the moment. Broncos head coach Sean Payton joined in. He joked that he told Nix the Broncos would not have drafted him had they known about his two previous ankle injuries.

The message from coach to QB was clear, though, with Payton remarking that Nix is “such a strong, faith-based guy.”

“He knows that God’s got a plan for him,” Payton told reporters on January 17. “He’s a tough cookie. And I said, ‘Listen, I believe you’re the second quarterback in Year 2 to take your team to a championship game,’ and the first is [Patrick] Mahomes. And this team, all year, has lost key players.

“We’ll rise up for the next challenge, and we’ll go from there.”

Pat Surtain II Sends Strong Message for Bo Nix Before AFC Championship Game

The Broncos will not have Nix the rest of the way, however long that may be, but the second-year QB is on the minds of teammates like All-Pro cornerback Pat Surtain II.

The reigning Defensive Player of the Year and three-time Pro Bowler expressed sentiments of support following Nix’s injury, for which he will undergo surgery during the coming week. Even if he is not physically present, Nix will be with Surtain and the Broncos.

“We got ya 10!” Surtain captioned a post on his Instagram story on January 17.

While the Broncos eye potentially getting players back, such as running back J.K. Dobbins, losing Nix is a cloud that will loom over them the rest of the way.

And as we saw last year, that was indeed a problem for the Cowboys.
When you think about the Cowboys are about to hire their fourth defensive coordinator in four years, that pretty much wipes out any chance of real consistency.
And that was one of the biggest problems for the Cowboys defense in 2025 - regular mistakes and confusion especially in the secondary.
Overall, the substations were a lack of communication, which stems from the leadership, both from the players and coaches.","Kurt: We hear on a regular basis how the offensive line needs to play together in order to build communication, and if you ask any running back, he'll tell you he's got to have consistent reps to get into the flow of the game. So it only makes sense that, although perhaps to a lesser degree, the same can be said for the defense.

And as we saw last year, that was indeed a problem for the Cowboys. Consider that only three players in the team's secondary played at least 50 percent of the snaps in 2025, Donovan Wilson (83.2), DaRon Bland (67.4) and Malik Hooker (53.7), and even they all missed games due to injury. And just one linebacker, Kenneth Murray, played more than half the snaps (78.9) on the way to Dallas finishing last in the league in points allowed (30.1).

Conversely, Seattle's defense, which led the NFL in average points given up (16.6), had six defensive backs see at least 60 percent of the Seahawks' snaps with five linebackers getting in on 50 percent of the plays. They also had 17 defensemen overall play at least 20 percent of their snaps while the Cowboys had a whopping 24 top 20 percent, if you count DeMarvion Overshown coming in at 19.7.

That kind of turnover makes finding any kind of cohesion so much tougher. There's just no denying that injuries, general poor play and, in turn, a lack of significant depth were key factors in the unit's struggles with communication.

So yes, a new defensive coordinator was needed to straighten out some of this mess, but if they run into the same injuries and even talent evaluation next season, the Cowboys defense could be in for another tough campaign.

Nick: First of all, I think we can throw consistency out the window when talking about the defense. Nothing consistent about this season, the previous one or the one before that. When you think about the Cowboys are about to hire their fourth defensive coordinator in four years, that pretty much wipes out any chance of real consistency.

Sure, you're talking about as the season goes on and wondering if there should be that many mistakes, especially with guys not sure what to do. And the answer is no - that shouldn't be happening. And that was one of the biggest problems for the Cowboys defense in 2025 - regular mistakes and confusion especially in the secondary. That's going to happen when you play a lot of young players, have a lot of injuries and the Cowboys had both. But it can't just end right there. This team had systematic failures on defense all year long and that has to fall on the coordinator and coaching staff, which it did.

But in terms of substitutions, I think the Cowboys were always looking for the right combination, just hoping to find the best players on the field. Sure, you like to rotate on defense, especially on the line, but there can't be a major drop-off. That was always he problem with having guys like DeMarcus Ware and Micah Parsons - sure they needed a break, but when is the right time to have your best pass-rusher off the field. Well, the Cowboys didn't have those problems this year. The starters and backups weren't that different and that was a reason for the lack of sacks and pressures. Overall, the substations were a lack of communication, which stems from the leadership, both from the players and coaches. All of it needs to be changed and it sounds like the Cowboys are working towards doing that.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/qpcd3knx4xnqyrpmrfxf,N,,2026-01-20 16:01:45.029917

""This is next man up mentality to a T,"" DiNucci said. ""For Jarrett Stidham, there's a reason he re-signed with the Denver Broncos in the offseason; a chance to play, a chance to mean something for this team if something, God forbid, happened to Bo Nix, which unfortunately, it did tonight.""

DiNucci detailed how things are likely to go in practice this week for Denver; the cadence of everything will have to change, the mindset will change, and obviously, the quarterback will have changed.

One day after his breakdown for CBS Sports, the quarterback-turned analyst got a call from the Broncos and signed with the team's practice squad.

DiNucci officially signed with Denver's practice squad on Monday, taking over QB3 duties. DiNucci has experience with head coach Sean Payton, having been with the Broncos in 2023. DiNucci could serve as Denver's emergency third quarterback for the AFC championship on Sunday.

Kittle hurt his right Achilles tendon in a wild-card win over Philadelphia on Jan. 11 and had surgery last week in Los Angeles. Kittle said Dr. Neal ElAttrache told him he had a “clean tear” near his soleus muscle that is higher on the Achilles tendon.

“They didn’t have to drill into my heel,” Kittle said Monday. “Where the repair was, there’s more blood flow so it takes some time off the recovery time. So he’s very excited about everything. My recovery — when I’ll be running, when I’ll be ready to go play again — he’s very excited about it. So that puts me in a really good mood. It’s not as bad as other ones.”

Kittle didn't want to give a timeline for his potential return, saying, “I'll keep it a surprise.” But a return in eight to nine months could get Kittle back on the field near the beginning of the 2026 season.

Kittle said he knew immediately how serious the injury was, saying it ""felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger.”

He told the Eagles trainer who was first on the field to check on him that he needed a cart and was taken back to the locker room. Kittle was joined there by his family, as well as Niners owner Jed York, who procured a bottle of tequila for his star player.

“Getting his support was absolutely fantastic,"" Kittle said. ""Just the fact that the team owner comes down to come give his condolences to you, and just like stays there for you, just really means what kind of place this is, and the people that are in this building. And it makes me really happy to be a Niner.”

Kittle is a two-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowler who is a key part of San Francisco’s offence as a passing threat and a blocker in the run game. He had 57 catches for 628 yards receiving and seven touchdowns this season.

The Niners struggled offensively in his absence last week, losing 41-6 to Seattle in the divisional round.

Injury updates

There were a few other injury updates on locker cleanout day.

Star linebacker Fred Warner said he was ready to return had the team advanced to the NFC title game, but now will slow down his rehabilitation work with significantly more time to heal.

“I think my rehab had gotten obviously super accelerated to try to make the NFC championship game,” Warner said. ""Now, I just get to kind of slow things down and really just work on all the little things that I didn’t get to work on before all this happened. It’s just business as usual.”

Rookie defensive end Mykel Williams, who tore his ACL in Week 9, said his rehabilitation is going well and he hopes to be ready for the season opener.

Quarterback Brock Purdy said he won't need any special treatment for his turf toe injury that sidelined him for eight games during the season.

″The toe is good to go,” Purdy said. “Obviously, I’ll continue to strengthen it and give it some rest and whatnot. But it’s good.”",https://www.sportsnet.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CP174967123.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 11:08:09.243664

Let’s dive in.

NFL Conference Championship Injury Report: Quarterbacks

Bo Nix, Denver Broncos

Broncos fans got terrible news shortly after their win this week over Buffalo. The news was that Bo Nix has suffered a broken ankle and would miss the remainder of the playoffs. This is a huge blow, and his backup is Jarrett Stidham, who hasn’t thrown an NFL pass since 2023.

NFL Conference Championship Injury Report: Running Backs

J.K. Dobbins, Denver Broncos

Dobbins is officially having his practice window opened, meaning there’s a chance he could return to action should Denver make the Super Bowl. This would be a notable addition for this roster, as RJ Harvey has been more effective as a pass-catching back than as a runner.

Zach Charbonnet, Seattle Seahawks

Charbonnet suffered a torn ACL this weekend against San Francisco, ending his season. Seattle will be without their leading touchdown scorer for the conference championship against the Rams.

NFL Conference Championship Injury Report: Wide Receivers

Troy Franklin, Denver Broncos

Franklin suffered a hamstring injury that took him out of action this weekend. His status will be monitored, but his loss was certainly felt, given the other injuries to this offense.

Pat Bryant, Denver Broncos

Bryant suffered a concussion this weekend and will be in the protocol this week as a result. He will have to clear concussion protocol to return to action against the Patriots this week, which feels unlikely at this stage.

What a bummer for Charbonnet and for this Seahawks offense.","Unfortunately, Seattle Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald’s initial optimism that running back Zach Charbonnet’s injury was not serious was merely optimism. The reality is that Charbonnet, who led all Seahawks players with 12 touchdowns scored, will not play again this season.

Coach Macdonald confirmed on his weekly Seattle Sports 710 radio appearance that Charbonnet’s knee injury, which he suffered in the second quarter of Seattle’s 41-6 Divisional Round win over the San Francisco 49ers, is serious enough to need season-ending surgery.

Charbonnet was in the middle of the best season of his career, rushing for 730 yards and the aforementioned 12 touchdowns, the most by any Seahawks running back since Marshawn Lynch in 2014. Alongside Kenneth Walker III, Seattle’s rushing attack has improved significantly over the past several weeks, with Charbonnet notably rushing for the Seahawks’ only touchdown in the Week 18 NFC West title game against the 49ers, having previously rushed for over 100 yards and two scores in Week 17 at the Carolina Panthers. Of course, the story of Seattle’s top seed can’t be told without Charbonnet’s bizarre game-tying two-point conversion against the Los Angeles Rams.

The Seahawks will now turn to Walker as the undisputed number one option at running back. Walker rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns in a magnificent showing versus San Francisco, but after a season’s worth of splitting carries with Charbonnet, he’s going to be getting the bulk of the carries starting with this Sunday’s NFC Championship Game against the Los Angeles Rams.

Seattle does have other backup options at running back on the practice squad, including Velus Jones Jr and former Rams starter Cam Akers. George Holani is still on injured reserve and there hasn’t been much of an indication that he’s nearing a return, but we’ll see on that front.

The Bills fired Sean McDermott on Monday, making the 10th coaching change of the 2026 cycle.

Gannon is reportedly talking with the Cowboys about their defensive coordinator position this week, and has interviewed with the Titans for their head coaching job.
UPDATE: It looks like the openings have fallen back down to seven again, with the Dolphins going with Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley.","There are 8 coaching openings now. Again. After starting as 9 and falling to 7, and with a total of 10 overall.

The Bills fired Sean McDermott on Monday, making the 10th coaching change of the 2026 cycle. The Giants (John Harbaugh) and the Falcons (Kevin Stefanski) have already filled their vacancies, but still, 10 switches in one cycle is an incredibly big number.

The Cardinals are obviously one of the 10.

ESPN reported that this is the fifth time there have been 10 openings for one coaching cycle, the others being 1978, 1997, 2006, and 2022. Only within one of these cycles were the Cardinals seeking a coach; that came back in 1978 after Don Coryell left and the team hired Bud Wilkinson. (It should be noted that in 1978 there were only 28 teams, so 10 openings was 36 percent of the jobs, higher than now with 32 teams.)

The Bills move impacts the Cardinals from two angles -- one, as another opening with which the Cards may have to contend with in terms of taking a candidate the Cards may want; two, putting McDermott on the market. We'll see if McDermott would have any interest for Cardinals GM Monti Ossenfort, but even to a lesser level, if McDermott ends up in one of the other vacancies, that could make available a coach that would have otherwise taken the job McDermott gets.

Among the coaches the Cardinals have reportedly reached out to that remain in the playoffs -- now down to the final four -- are Rams assistants Mike LaFleur and Chris Shula, Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, Broncos defensive coordinator Vance Joseph, and Patriots passing game coordinator Thomas Brown.

Also coming out Monday was the news the Lions are hiring Cardinals offensive coordinator Drew Petzing in the same role, the first coach on Jonathan Gannon's staff to get another NFL spot. Gannon is reportedly talking with the Cowboys about their defensive coordinator position this week, and has interviewed with the Titans for their head coaching job.

UPDATE: It looks like the openings have fallen back down to seven again, with the Dolphins going with Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley.

Or they might not be playing for a trip to Super Bowl LX at all.

Recall how significant of a role the third-year running back played when the Seahawks beat their division rivals in Seattle in Week 16.

Charbonnet opened the scoring with a 4-yard touchdown run and then made an all-time heads-up play on a 2-point attempt in the fourth quarter. As other players were starting to walk off the field, thinking Sam Darnold's screen pass had been batted down for an incompletion, Charbonnet wisely grabbed what turned out to be a live ball in the end zone. The successful try tied the score at 30-30, completing the Seahawks' improbable comeback from a 16-point deficit before they prevailed in overtime.

The win kept them atop the NFC West standings and in control of the conference's top seed.

The play that kept them alive in regulation showed one of the many traits that have made Charbonnet a favorite of coach Mike Macdonald. But the Seahawks will be without those traits for the rest of their postseason now that Charbonnet -- part of their two-headed rushing attack with Kenneth Walker III -- needs season-ending surgery to repair a knee injury he suffered during Seattle's 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional round Saturday.

You could hear the pain in Macdonald's voice when he delivered the news Monday.

""It breaks your heart,"" Macdonald told Seattle Sports 710-AM. ""... Prayers go out to Charbs. We love him, man. This guy is the epitome of what it means to be a Seahawk. Absolute tough as nails, great teammate, great human being, plays his tail off, detail-oriented, unselfish. This hurts, man. It hurts that it's going on, but he's going to be back. He's going to be back stronger than ever, and the guys are going to pick him up.""

Charbonnet's loss is a significant one given his importance in third down and short-yardage situations, but it shouldn't be insurmountable if Walker continues his recent tear.

Walker carried 19 times for 116 yards and three touchdowns against San Francisco, powering Seattle's red-hot run game after Charbonnet went down in the second quarter. Walker finished with 100 yards in the Week 16 win over the Rams and 97 when they beat the 49ers in the regular-season finale, which put him over 1,000 for the season.

""I think Ken has done a heck of a job,"" Macdonald said. ""I think you're seeing the results in the past X amount of weeks now of ... stacking all those reps. I thought this was the most decisive he's ran up to this point, and as expected, you just keep getting better and keep finding ways to improve, especially in the run game. He's done a great job.""

Walker has played in all 18 games this season after entering the final year of his rookie contract with durability concerns. It has probably helped that he hasn't carried the ball more than 19 times in any of them while sharing the work with Charbonnet. The rest of the Seahawks' playoff run will either be a test of Walker's ability to handle a greater workload or of the ability of their backup running backs to step into larger roles, whether it's Cam Akers, Velus Jones Jr., George Holani or a combination of the three.

However it happens, the Seahawks will need their run game to take pressure off of Darnold as he continues to play through an oblique injury.

Akers, who won Super Bowl LVI with the Rams, and Jones are on Seattle's practice squad. Holani is eligible to come off injured reserve -- where he has been since hurting his hamstring in Week 12 - though Macdonald did not indicate whether or not that will happen this week.

""That's part of the reason we brought them here, is to provide great running back depth,"" Macdonald said of Jones and Akers. ""Both are really good players in their own right, and they've got a great opportunity in front of them. You hate it to be under these circumstances, but it is what it is. We've got to move forward. So they'll be ready to go.""

Another way in which the Seahawks can make up for Charbonnet's absence is with their tush push play, which has become almost unstoppable in short-yardage situations with tight end AJ Barner. Barner has converted 10 of 11 attempts, though only one of those plays has resulted in a touchdown as Seattle has instead relied on Charbonnet at the goal line. Six of Charbonnet's team-high 12 rushing touchdowns came from 1 or 2 yards out.

""That's going to be something we continue to lean on,"" Macdonald said of the tush push. ""These other guys will be good in some of those [goal-line] situations as well.""

When the Seahawks opted not to give Walker an extension this past offseason when he became eligible for one, the logical assumption was that they had reservations about his durability after sitting out 10 games in three years. He was then limited during the spring because of an ankle injury before a sore foot sidelined him for a chunk of training camp.

It was a tough start to a contract year after Walker had made changes over the offseason to his eating and sleeping habits with an eye toward improving his durability and performance. But since then, he has barely appeared on the weekly injury reports while playing in all 18 games so far.

How he performs in Charbonnet's absence will help determine his future in Seattle and whether the Seahawks' offense can continue to ride its run game to Super Bowl LX.

""I know he was working through his foot over the course of the offseason. That was frustrating for him because of the amount of work that he was putting in,"" Macdonald said. ""Hopefully he realizes the dividends that's paid, that work he put in to really get himself in a good spot up to this point. I've seen a guy that's gotten better through the season. You can't say that about all runners, so that's a tribute to him and how he's taken I have taken care of his body.""",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0120%2Fr1603038_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 10:01:42.979975

He said Byron Young has a sore knee, which is likely what limited him to a season-low snap share, but he’s expected to be able to play against the Seahawks in the NFC title game. Emmanuel Forbes Jr. left the game after just four snaps due to a shoulder injury, as well, and did not return.

One of the main storylines for the Niners heading into the 2026 NFL season will be the recovery of George Kittle.

Kittle suffered a torn Achilles tendon injury during the 49ers’ wild-card win over the Philadelphia Eagles. It was another blow for San Francisco, who couldn’t escape the injury bug all season to their top and even depth players.

On Jan. 19, Kittle spoke with the media and shared the latest regarding his recovery, as the veteran will likely do his best to be ready for Week 1 later this year.

“Overall, I’m fantastic,” Kittle said (h/t 95.7 The Game). “Surgeon went really, really well. The surgeon was incredibly happy with it. A little background into it: He said, ‘Best-case scenario when you tear an Achilles is that you tear it up high by your soleus,’ which is what I did. I had a clean tear. I didn’t have to drill into my heel. Where the repair was is where there was more blood flow.

“It takes some time off the recovery time. He’s very excited about everything—my recovery, when I’ll be running, when I’ll be ready to play again. He’s very excited about it. That puts me in a really good mood. It’s not as bad as the other ones, so just excited about that.”

49ers’ George Kittle Confirms Tequila Story

Moreover, Kittle also confirmed the tequila story, noting that he had the alcoholic drink in the locker room once the 49ers star knew he tore his Achilles tendon.

“My first response to that is, ‘Can I get Jed fined? What’s the question? Can I get Jed fined by talking about tequila?’ I would stop,” Kittle added (h/t 95.7 The Game). “Yeah, it happened. Had a great time.”

If the 49ers pursue a tight end either in the draft or free agency, perhaps it will allow them to take their time with Kittle and not rush him for Week 1 to ensure that the player is fully healthy once he’s ready to go for the 2026 season.

49ers Need to Address Injury Woes This Offseason

Injuries have been a major storyline for the 49ers for a while. As a result, CBS Sports NFL insider Jonathan Jones is urging San Francisco to find the root of the problem and address it as injuries have held this team back.

“The Niners have to figure out how to get healthier,” Jones said during a Jan. 17 appearance on CBS Sports HQ. “This continues to happen to them time and again because if you look at it, if they can stay moderately healthy, average health, they will make the playoffs every year. They will make noise in the playoffs. I can go on, and we could talk about how they need another wide receiver, and they do.

“They need some depth on the defense and certainly they could use some pass rush and some corner help. There’s no doubt that if they ran it back with the team that they have and even lose the free agents that they’re going to have, if they could stay healthy, 75 to 80 percent healthy, they’re in the NFC Championship game. I absolutely mean that. But instead, they can’t.”",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/george-kittle-san-francisco-49ers_e71f46.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-20 11:09:19.439319

Kittle didn’t want to give a timeline for his potential return, saying, “I’ll keep it a surprise.” But a return in eight to nine months could get Kittle back on the field near the beginning of the 2026 season.

Kittle said he knew immediately how serious the injury was, saying it “felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger.”

He told the Eagles trainer who was first on the field to check on him that he needed a cart and was taken back to the locker room. Kittle was joined there by his family, as well as Niners owner Jed York, who procured a bottle of tequila for his star player.

“Getting his support was absolutely fantastic,” Kittle said. “Just the fact that the team owner comes down to come give his condolences to you, and just like stays there for you, just really means what kind of place this is, and the people that are in this building. And it makes me really happy to be a Niner.”

Kittle is a two-time All-Pro and seven-time Pro Bowler who is a key part of San Francisco’s offense as a passing threat and a blocker in the run game. He had 57 catches for 628 yards receiving and seven touchdowns this season.

The Niners struggled offensively in his absence last week, losing 41-6 to Seattle in the divisional round.

Injury updates

There were a few other injury updates on locker cleanout day.

Star linebacker Fred Warner said he was ready to return had the team advanced to the NFC title game, but now will slow down his rehabilitation work with significantly more time to heal.

“I think my rehab had gotten obviously super accelerated to try to make the NFC championship game,” Warner said. “Now, I just get to kind of slow things down and really just work on all the little things that I didn’t get to work on before all this happened. It’s just business as usual.”

Rookie defensive end Mykel Williams, who tore his ACL in Week 9, said his rehabilitation is going well and he hopes to be ready for the season opener.

Quarterback Brock Purdy said he won’t need any special treatment for his turf toe injury that sidelined him for eight games during the season.

″The toe is good to go,” Purdy said. “Obviously, I’ll continue to strengthen it and give it some rest and whatnot. But it’s good.”

He was able to really help Mukuba during his rookie season.","Drew Mukuba had finally found some consistency in his rookie season and then it was over in a flash.

On Nov. 18, Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio agreed that the rookie from Texas had finally found consistency in his game after an “uneven” start to his season.

A few days later, Mukuba fractured his fibula in Dallas.

“The toughest part about that was just knowing that I can’t finish the year out,” Mukuba said at locker cleanout day last week. “I just started to build some consistency in my game. So knowing that I was able to do that and that I was playing at a high level, I felt like going down, that was kind of discouraging.

“But I kind of got over it with the guys around me and the help that I had. They helped change my mentality. Knowing that this is not a bad thing, just another way, another hurdle I gotta get over. I was able to work through that.”

After Mukuba suffered his fibula fracture that needed surgery, the Eagles didn’t rule him out for the season and held out some public hope that he could return at some point.

But at locker cleanout day, Mukuba said there was no way he could have returned even if the Eagles made it to the Super Bowl. The day after the Eagles’ season ended, Mukuba was still in a walking boot. But he did express an expectation that he will be ready for spring practices in May.

While Mukuba’s season ended on a sour note because of the injury, he feels pretty encouraged by some of his progress as a rookie.

“Yeah, definitely,” Mukuba said. “I feel like with my experience this year, everything I seen, I feel like I played a lot of snaps to see a lot of things. I feel like going into my second year, that’s going to help me a lot because I’m already ahead. I know what to expect and I know what’s going to happen. Now it’s just my job to do my part.”

While Mukuba didn’t begin the season as a starter, he the second-round pick from Texas took over that role and started the next 10 games. He had some ups and downs but showed some promise with 46 tackles, 2 interceptions and 3 pass breakups.

Mukuba made some plays on the ball but he gave up some plays too. He was targeted 20 times in his rookie season and gave up 14 passes for 263 yards with 2 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. His opposer passer rating allowed was a 106.3. But Fangio expected some growing pains for a rookie safety.

Like Fangio said earlier in the season, Mukuba’s rookie season was “uneven” at one point. But he really began to even it out before the injury. He found a stability in his game.

How did he get there?

“Just looking in the mirror, looking at myself and what I needed to do on my end,” Mukuba said. “I just felt like there were a lot of things I needed to get better at and I didn’t get to rush it. Just take one step at a time, finding one thing to work on, get better at that and then finding something else to improve on. Once I got to do that, that’s when I started to see my game grow, started to get better in a lot of areas I was struggling in. That’s when everything picked up for me.”

After Mukuba went down, the Eagles started Sydney Brown for one game but then quickly inserted veteran Marcus Epps into that spot for the rest of the season next to Reed Blankenship.

There are some serious questions about the Eagles’ safety position going into 2026 because both Blankenship and Epps are pending free agents. There’s a chance one or both could be gone.

Blankenship, 26, joined the Eagles as an undrafted rookie in 2022 but became a full-time starter over the last three seasons. He was able to really help Mukuba during his rookie season.

“Just really how to be a pro, to be honest with you,” Mukuba said when asked what he learned from Blankenship. “I feel like how he handles his business, how he takes care of his body, what he did off the field with the person he is overall, it really taught me a lot. I was just sitting back and watching him and learning and he definitely showed me how to be a true professional.”",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/11/Mukuba-D-USATSI-2247173456.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-20 11:09:29.087294

Patriots injury analysis: NFL divisional playoffs

LB Robert Spillane: The Patriots’ defensive leader took a trip to the blue medical tent on the sideline after the Texans’ second series and was announced as questionable to return with a thumb injury. However, the issue did not keep him out long. While he did end up missing five defensive snaps, Spillane was back on the field at the start of the next series in the late first quarter.

RB TreVeyon Henderson: Henderson remained on the ground after a short run in the early second period, but eventually jogged to sideline under his own power. He did get checked out by trainers and was not on the field for the subsequent two offensive snaps, but returned for the next series midway through the quarter. No injury was announced by the team.

RB Rhamondre Stevenson: The Patriots’ lead running back spent some time on the sideline in the first half after getting poked in the eye. He was ultimately announced as questionable to return, but by the third quarter was back in action wearing a clear visor on his helmet. Stevenson ended up carrying the ball 13 times for 45 yards after reentering, and did not show any limitations.

S Craig Woodson: The rookie safety took a hard hit on his interception with 8:37 left in the second quarter and looked shaken up afterwards. He visited the medical tent and was announced as questionable to return with a head injury, but ultimately was cleared for return and ended up missing just two defensive snaps.

CB Charles Woods: On the very next play after Craig Woodson’s return, another defensive back got banged up. No. 4 cornerback Charles Woods was slow to get up after a punt, but he ultimately made his way to the sideline and did not end up missing any time. As with the aforementioned TreVeyon Henderson, no injury was announced by the team.

OT Morgan Moses: The Patriots’ starting right tackle was slow to get up after a lost fumble midway through the third quarter, but he made his way to the sideline under his own power. No injury update was announced, and Moses was back in action after New England had reacquired possession five plays later. He did end up missing a pair of snaps later in the game, though: on the two final kneel-downs, backup tackle Thayer Munford Jr. took his spot in the lineup.

ED Anfernee Jennings: Jennings was able to sack Houston quarterback C.J. Stroud with 2:37 left in the third quarter, but with teammate Christian Elliss coming in to clean up came down hard on the ground. The sixth-year defender was shaken up a bit, but never entered the medical tent and was back in action after two plays.

CB Carlton Davis: After catching two interceptions earlier in the game, Davis had to exit the contest in the early fourth quarter. The veteran cornerback was banged up after making a tackle on a run play, and was immediately removed from the field. He went into the medical tent and was announced as questionable to return with a head injury. Eventually, Davis departed for the locker room and was ruled out with two minutes left in the game.

What this means for the Patriots

The Patriots’ injury situation obviously is not as dire as the Broncos’ — Denver lost starting quarterback Bo Nix to an ankle injury on Saturday — but there are still some question marks hanging over the team. The biggest among them is starting cornerback Carlton Davis, whose head injury will be worth paying close attention to in the coming days.

Davis himself did not speak with the media after the game, which is standard procedure for players dealing with head injuries. On Monday, Mike Vrabel did not provide any update on his status.

Should Davis end up missing time, the Patriots’ backup cornerbacks will be pressed into action. Based on the season so far, Charles Woods projects as the next man up. The team also recently got Alex Austin back from injured reserve and has rookie Kobee Minor as additional depth on the 53-man roster.

As for the other injuries listed above, none of them seemed overly serious. Of course, the days following a game can always change the outlook, which is why we will get a first true update on Wednesday: the Patriots will hold their first practice of the week that afternoon and later release their initial injury report.

Charbonnet injured his knee during Saturday night’s 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC divisional round.

“He’s got a significant knee injury, unfortunately,” Macdonald said on Seattle Sports 710 on Monday. “Breaks your heart. He’s going to need surgery, so he’s got a good long road to come back. Our heart goes out to him, prayers go out to Charbs. We love him, man.”

During the regular season, Charbonnet led the Seahawks with 12 rushing touchdowns, as well as added 730 yards, which trailed only Kenneth Walker III for the team lead.

Charbonnet became the first Seahawks running back since Marshawn Lynch in 2014 to rush for at least 10 touchdowns in a season.

Walker, whose three rushing touchdowns against the 49ers tied him with Shaun Alexander for the most in a playoff game in franchise history, is the only healthy running back on Seattle’s roster. The Seahawks could add either of veteran running backs Velus Jones Jr. or Cam Akers from the practice squad, as well as George Holani, who has been on injured reserve since late November.

Regardless, the Seahawks will be without Charbonnet ahead of their NFC championship game matchup against the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.

“This guy is the epitome of what it means to be a Seahawk,” Macdonald said. “Absolute tough as nails, great teammate, great human being, plays his tail off, detail oriented, unselfish.

Asked if there was a timeline for his return, Kittle initially said he'd ""keep it as a surprise.""
""[ElAttrache] said best-case scenario when you tear an Achilles is that you tear it up high by your soleus, which is what I did.
Whether it's from injury, free agency or potential trade, Kittle's situation isn't the only possible return the 49ers are monitoring this offseason.
He missed most of training camp as he battled a hamstring injury and sought a lucrative contract extension from the Niners.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Despite tearing his right Achilles tendon on Jan. 11, San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle said he is optimistic he could return to the field sooner than expected next season.

As the 49ers cleaned out their lockers Monday, Kittle spoke to the media for the first time since the injury, explaining that it was the ""best-case scenario"" because of where the tear occurred and how clean it was.

Asked if there was a timeline for his return, Kittle initially said he'd ""keep it as a surprise."" but he later scoffed when asked by a reporter whether his return would be around midseason and said it could happen ""well before November.""

Dr. Neal ElAttrache did the surgery on Kittle's Achilles last week in Los Angeles.

""Surgery went really, really good,"" Kittle said. ""[ElAttrache] said best-case scenario when you tear an Achilles is that you tear it up high by your soleus, which is what I did. I had a clean tear. They didn't have to drill into my heel. And where the repair was there's more blood flow. And so it takes some time off of the recovery time... It's not as bad as other ones.""

When the injury happened in the first half against the Eagles, Kittle said a member of Philadelphia's athletic training staff came over and asked what he needed. His immediate response? A cart.

""I knew exactly when it happened, it felt like someone put a shotgun up against my calf and pulled the trigger,"" Kittle said. ""The second it happened, I knew exactly what it was... Unfortunate, but football's tough sometimes.""

Whether it's from injury, free agency or potential trade, Kittle's situation isn't the only possible return the 49ers are monitoring this offseason. Starting quarterback Brock Purdy will work to strengthen his right big toe, linebacker Fred Warner's rehab from a broken and dislocated right ankle will continue, quarterback Mac Jones is a candidate to be traded and receiver Jauan Jennings headlines San Francisco's list of pending unrestricted free agents.

Purdy missed eight games this season because of a variant of turf toe in his right big toe. He returned in Week 11 and was able to finish the season without issue. He said Monday he will not need any further operations on the toe.

""[The] toe is good to go,"" Purdy said. ""Obviously, I'll continue to strengthen it and give it some rest and whatnot too, but it's good.""

Jones, meanwhile, enters an offseason that comes with more uncertainty. Stepping in for Purdy for those eight games, Jones kept the 49ers in the playoff mix as they went 5-3 in games he started. He posted a 62.9 QBR (ninth in the NFL) and threw for 13 touchdowns and six interceptions while throwing for 268.9 yards per game in his starts.

That production came after posting QBRs of 38.4, 37.5 and 36.6 in his three previous seasons split between the New England Patriots and Jacksonville Jaguars. While Jones has another season left on the two-year contract he signed with the 49ers in March and says he'd be just fine sticking around for another year, he's aware that his production in Purdy's place could make him a sought-after candidate for quarterback-needy teams in the trade market.

""It was just so fun to get, as I say, the train back on the tracks and that's what I wanted to do,"" Jones said. ""I put a lot of good film out there... Had a lot of fun and excited for what's next. And I don't know, I'm on a two-year deal, but I do believe I'm a starter in this league and I'm excited for continuing to get better this offseason and see what happens.""

Jennings will have far more say in the next step in his career. He missed most of training camp as he battled a hamstring injury and sought a lucrative contract extension from the Niners. He ultimately played the season out after getting some sweeteners added but also played through shoulder, ankle and rib injuries as he finished with 55 receptions for 643 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns.

If the 49ers and Jennings can't reach agreement on a new deal before March, he would become an unrestricted free agent for the first time. And though the Niners figure to have plenty of need at receiver, there's a chance Jennings won't be back.

That possibility was made clear as Jennings got emotional talking about what his six seasons in San Francisco mean to him on Monday afternoon.

""It means everything,"" Jennings said. ""It's nothing like Santa Clara. First flew in here, I was thinking I was going to San Francisco just like everybody else. And you find out fast it's Santa Clara. Now it's home. It quickly turned into home and a run I'll never forget for sure.""

Like Kittle, another Niner who will be back in 2026 is Warner. His attempt to speed up his recovery from the devastating ankle injury he suffered in Week 6 came up just short after the 49ers lost to Seattle on Saturday night.

Now, Warner can pump the brakes and enjoy a more traditional rehab process.

""No extra surgeries are needed,"" Warner said. ""I think my rehab had gotten obviously super accelerated to try to make the NFC Championship Game. Now, I just get to kind of slow things down and really just work on all the little things that I didn't get to work on before all this happened. It's just business as usual.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0119%2Fr1602868_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-20 05:59:58.711914

Bill Speros writes: ""The Patriots haven’t lost a game on the road since Dec. 22, 2024, and own the best NFL record ATS at 13-5-1. This early line movement shows how much New England’s defense impressed oddsmakers. Denver, meanwhile, remains deep underwater on the number at 8-9. The Broncos (-1.5) covered in their wild and woolly 33-30 OT win over the Bills. But even there, they may have gotten a boost, given no one seems to know what constitutes a reception these days. Weather (45 and sunny) won’t be a factor. Don’t be surprised to see this total get eclipsed with plenty of time to spare. New England’s defense delivers in the thin air at Mile High, but the Broncos (thanks in part to the atomic leg of kicker Wil Lutz) nab a backdoor cover. Meanwhile, the Patriots return to the Super Bowl. Everything old is new again.""

But you just feel for feel for the guy, for the person.
""That's part of the reason we brought him here is just to provide great running back depth"" Macdonald said of the two backs.
Another possibility at running back could be second-year running back George Holani who is currently eligible to come off of injured reserve.
All season long Macdonald has credited the effort of the team as the reason the Seahawks have gotten this far.","1. Mike Macdonald is ""pretty sure"" Zach Charbonnet's knee injury in an ACL.

On Monday morning, head coach Mike Macdonald announced that Seahawks running back Zach Charbonnet would be out the remainder of the season with a “significant knee injury.”

And during his Monday press conference, he gave a little more clarity on what the injury is.

""Pretty sure it's ACL,"" he said. ""We're figuring out what the extent of the injury is and we'll get all the details on when he's going to get it fixed and all that. But you just feel for feel for the guy, for the person. This guy's just a absolute stud. But he's around and he's in good spirits and we got his back.""

Right now, Kenneth Walker III is the only running back on the 53-man roster but Seattle has Velus Jones Jr. and Cam Akers on the practice squad.

""That's part of the reason we brought him here is just to provide great running back depth"" Macdonald said of the two backs. ""Both are really good players in their own right. And they got a great opportunity in front of them. So you hate it to be under these circumstances, but it is what it is. We got to move forward. So they'll be ready to go.""

Another possibility at running back could be second-year running back George Holani who is currently eligible to come off of injured reserve.

""George is an option."" Macdonald said. ""We'll see how it goes this week.""

When asked if Holani is physically up to speed, Macdonald said, ""I think we'll just let it play out this week on how everything goes but probably hear from that over the next few days.""

As far as other injuries go, Macdonald said they're working through other players being, ""banged up.""

""So we'll kind of play that day by day.""

And Josh Jones ,who was injured in the divisional game, could make a return this week.

""We got to see how it is on Wednesday. If he's good enough to practice, great. If not, we got to move, go to third ... It's kind of where we're at right now.""

Macdonald also said Charles Cross who left the game out of, ""precaution"" with a foot injury would not need to practice in order to play this week.

2. Kenneth Walker III worked on himself during the offseason and now it's, ""paying dividends.""

During training camp, Kenneth Walker III shared that he was being intentional about the food he was eating and prioritizing sleep in an effort to be healthier this season. He missed six games last season due to injury.

""I definitely feel it in my performance, so I'm going to just keep it up and go into it with the season.""

He added, ""It's more like a routine. Here, you get more healthy, clean foods at the facility and then my sleeping habits; I (go to) sleep at around 10 to 10:30 (p.m.). These past years, even in college, I used to stay up until 1:00 (a.m.) because I'm just staying up. It's definitely helped a lot, and I feel much better and extra recovery definitely helps a lot when I come back out here and practice again.""

Now 18 games later, Walker has played in every matchup and has managed to stay healthy and available all while racking up 1,027 rushing yards during the regular season. And on Saturday, he rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns.

Macdonald said, ""I know he was working through his foot at the beginning over the course of the offseason and that was frustrating for him because of the amount of work that he was putting in. And I think hopefully he realizes the dividends that that's paid, that work that he's put in to really get himself in a good spot up to this point, because what I've seen, I've seen a guy that's, he's gotten better throughout the season, so you can't say that about all runners. And so that's a tribute to him and how he's taken care of his body.

3. Seahawks effort has gotten them this far.

All season long Macdonald has credited the effort of the team as the reason the Seahawks have gotten this far. He says the player's mindset to get this far started in the offseason when majority of the team participated in volunteer offseason workouts. And as the name suggests, players have no obligation to participate, but all chose to.

That buy-in translated to the season and the effort they've all decided to give every game.

""I don't think I'd be standing here right now talking to you guys if our team hasn't decided to play with that type of effort. And that's really all three phases. So that's a decision that they've made that they want to play to.""

Following games, in team meetings, Macdonald will usually show plays to the team that he would describe as, ""shocking effort"" and from this past game one of those plays was at the end of a Walker run, the entire offensive line helped push the ball forward for a few extra yards, despite already gaining the first down.

""No, that was awesome,"" Macdonald said. ""Just every yard matters. So guys are fired up to watch that one.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/utvnv92wxavalcdgvesd,N,,2026-01-20 01:00:17.958140

More Seahawks on SI stories Seahawks vs. Rams III: Early odds for NFC Championship released Sam Darnold one of NFL’s biggest winners from divisional round What separates the Seahawks from Rams, Broncos & Patriots","If Sam Darnold was bothered by his oblique injury during the Seattle Seahawks' dismantling of the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday night he did a good job of hiding it.

Offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak did his part in protecting Seattle's new franchise quarterback by dialing up a run-heay game plan. Ken Walker followed through with the best game any Seahawks running back has had in the playoffs in 20 years, roasting he Niners for nearly 150 scrimmage yards and scoring three touchdowns.

For Darnold's part he only had to throw 17 pass attempts - and only a couple of them really challenged his throwing power. Darnold's bullet to Jaxon Smith-Njigba in the end zone should lay to rest any concerns about how much torque he can put into a pass.

Odds are Darnold had some help from the Seahawks' training staff, though in the form of a Toradol shot. Here's what one anonymous NFL executive thinks the team did to get Darnold through the game, according to Mike Sando at The Athletic.

""He didn't throw a pass until 45 minutes before kickoff,"" an exec from another team said. ""That tells me they gave him the shot an hour before the game. You have a strategy where you are trying to time it up. You want to wait as long as you can before giving him the shot.""

This makes sense, and explains why Darnold wasn't out on the field warming up with Drew Lock, Jalen Milroe and the rest of the Seahawks offense.

That development brought on a lot of anxiety from Seattle's fanbase, but it turned out to be a nothing-burger of a story. Whether it was Toradol or a simple case of the injury being made out to be more than it was, Darnold showed no signs of being limited by his oblique issue.

Even if Darnold hadn't been able to play, odds are the result would not have been much different. Drew Lock could have thrown three pick-sixes in Darnold's place and the Seahawks still would have won comfortably by two touchdowns.

Looking ahead, Darnold faces Round 3 of the toughest challenge he's faced in this phase of his career. His two worst games this season have both come against the Rams, throwing six of his 14 interceptions against them. If Darnold can just play one more clean game the Seahawks will be on their way to the Super Bowl.

The 21-year-old Williams spoke to reporters Monday as the 49ers cleaned out their lockers, describing what he has gone through after the most severe injury of his young career -- and how Bosa, who now has torn his ACL three times, is helping him through it.

""I ain't going to lie to you, it's been hard,"" Williams said. ""It's been hard dealing with something like this, of this significance. Probably the biggest injury I've ever had, and then just the time table that it takes [to return]. Then missing all the important games that I'm missing, and just the events that I'm missing with the guys out there. It would have been nice to be a part of it.""

Williams, San Francisco's first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, was just one of several high-profile injuries the 49ers overcame en route to an improbable NFC playoff run, which ended with a 41-6 divisional-round loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Saturday at Lumen Field.

But sidelined right along with him was fellow defensive end Bosa, who already served as a mentor for the young lineman and continued that role throughout their rehab.

""It helped me a lot, man,"" Williams said of leaning on Bosa. ""Bosa has been extremely helpful. He's like a real big brother. He looks out, he comes in, checks on me, sits down, eats lunch with me, talks to me, asks me about my knee, asks me how I'm feeling, like where I'm at in the process. ...

""I'll be feeling more comfortable leaning on him and asking him for stuff versus a lot of other people. So I just come to Bosa and lean on him, and ask him because he's been through it. He knows exactly what it felt like and how to how to move on.""

Find the latest San Francisco 49ers news, highlights, analysis and more with NBC Sports Bay Area and California.

Before tearing his ACL in the fourth quarter of the 49ers' 34-24 win over the New York Giants on Nov. 2, Williams had recorded one sack, one fumble recovery, 20 combined tackles (four for a loss) and three quarterback hits as one of three defensive linemen drafted by San Francisco before the season's start.

The 49ers relied heavily on the rookies in a year where youth was their MO, and coach Kyle Shanahan was pleased with what he saw from Williams as he adjusted to the NFL and dealt with numerous injuries, not just the ACL tear.

""We knew we needed a starting defensive end, that's what our goal was, and we also felt we needed some pass rushers who could play inside on third down,” Shanahan told NBC Sports Bay Area's Matt Maiocco on ""49ers Game Plan"" after the injury.

“We also wanted to bring in a good person with high character, high football character to our building. All he has shown us right away is the type of guy he is. Sometimes you got to see guys go through adversity to see how they'll grind and things like that, we got to see that.”

Williams showed the 49ers in a short time that he can be the player they need, and now, he'll continue studying film and learning from teammates like Bosa in an effort to return even better than before.",https://media.nbcsportsbayarea.com/2026/01/mykel-williams-nick-bosa-GettyImages-2227976019-e1768872478293.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2026-01-20 01:00:25.652216

Harrison put on 11 pounds of muscle, he had the foundation of what he learned as a rookie, and the Cardinals as a team were in a good spot.
Despite all that, wide receivers coach Drew Terrell noted in December Harrison had made significant progress in his NFL game.
""I didn't feel like I played the whole season,"" Harrison said.
As Harrison wrapped up his media scrum, he was given another chance to describe the season.","As Marvin Harrison Jr. stood in front of his locker one final time for the 2025 season, his body having betrayed him down the stretch, the wide receiver tried to succinctly sum up his second NFL year.

""It was an incomplete season for me, really,"" he said.

That's far from what Harrison – and the Cardinals, for that matter – was expecting when the year began. Harrison put on 11 pounds of muscle, he had the foundation of what he learned as a rookie, and the Cardinals as a team were in a good spot.

The wins didn't come however, and neither did the Harrison jump. He had moments when his inconsistency seemed to weigh on him, moments when he seemed he was breaking out to a new level. Then came the injuries: a concussion, the surprise appendicitis, and then heel problems on both feet.

He played 11 games, but four of those were impacted by injury issues. He ended up with 41 receptions for 608 yards and four touchdowns, behind the stellar years of tight end Trey McBride and fellow wideout Michael Wilson.

""It's been a mental battle,"" Harrison said.

Despite all that, wide receivers coach Drew Terrell noted in December Harrison had made significant progress in his NFL game.

""There were a lot of things he had to learn, he had to adapt his way of thinking,"" Terrell said. ""I've seen the biggest change from him is probably his mindset and how he thinks about football, which has been good.

""He's playing a more free style of football.""

The appendicitis derailed Harrison harsher than just the two games he missed. He lost 10 pounds, or nearly all the muscle he had gained in his grind-it-out offseason. He didn't do much over those two weeks and tried to jump right back in.

In his first game back, he hurt his heel.

Wilson's ascension ran a parallel track to Harrison's body breakdown, with Wilson moving to WR1 and excelling. That at least gave Harrison a vicarious thrill.

""I know Mike's process more than most and he definitely deserved all the credit he is getting,"" he said. ""Kept putting good things on tape, approached the game the right way, and I couldn't be more proud of Mike and what he accomplished. He deserves it.""

Whatever the Cardinals get in a new coach and whatever offense they might run next season, the new staff will at least start with two pass catchers coming off huge years and a third – Harrison – who still very much has that potential.

""I didn't feel like I played the whole season,"" Harrison said. ""That's part of the league, and you have to be consistent.""

As Harrison wrapped up his media scrum, he was given another chance to describe the season.

Head coach Mike Macdonald confirmed that Charbonnet will miss the remainder of the playoffs, which is a big loss considering the two-headed monster Seattle has been using all year in the backfield.

Macdonald, who didn’t specify what Charbonnet’s injury was, said that he would be facing a ""long road back,"" which could mean he’s missing all of next season as well.

Charbonnet and Walker led the way for the 10th-best rushing team in the NFL this season, tallying 2,096 yards on the ground. Walker had 1,027 for the Seahawks, though Charbonnet was trusted by offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak in the red area, punching in 12 of 19 rushing scores.

Harrison dealt with three different injuries throughout the season, in addition to leaving a game because of a concussion.
Despite underperforming compared with his rookie season statistically, Harrison felt like he ""definitely improved"" in areas he focused on in the offseason.
Heading into last offseason, Terrell said he wanted Harrison to exhale and adopt the mantra of: ""I'm Marvin Harrison Jr.
But heading into this offseason, Terrell wants much of the same out of Harrison as he did last year.","TEMPE, Ariz. -- Marvin Harrison Jr. learned this season what kind of toll injuries can take on a player, physically and mentally.

But it wasn't just one ailment that set back the Cardinals' receiver. Or two, for that matter. Harrison dealt with three different injuries throughout the season, in addition to leaving a game because of a concussion. In all, they caused him to miss five games and prevented Harrison from taking the Year 2 jump that was anticipated heading into the 2025 season.

The injuries also led to Harrison feeling like he didn't completely fulfill his second year in the NFL. He finished with 41 catches for 608 yards and 4 touchdowns but didn't have a 100-yard game.

""I feel like [it was an] incomplete season for me, really,"" Harrison said.

Despite underperforming compared with his rookie season statistically, Harrison felt like he ""definitely improved"" in areas he focused on in the offseason.

Wide receivers coach Drew Terrell agreed.

""I've seen a lot of progress from Marv,"" Terrell said. ""There's a lot of things that he had to learn in the first year. He's had to adapt his way of thinking about certain things. So, I've seen the biggest change for him probably in his mindset and the way he thinks about football, which has been good. Unfortunately, he's had injuries, but he's had games prior to the injury ... where he's playing a more free style of football. So, I'm encouraged by what he's done in his second year.""

The injuries, however, were just too much for Harrison to overcome.

He suffered a concussion during Arizona's Week 6 trip to Indianapolis. Then, a day after the Cardinals' loss at Seattle in Week 9, Harrison was in the hospital because of an appendicitis procedure that sidelined him for two weeks. That was a major blow to Harrison's season, causing him to lose 10 pounds -- about the same amount of weight he put on in the offseason -- and forcing him to go ""back to square one a little bit."" Harrison said he never had a chance to ""really"" recover before he had to jump back into football.

He returned from appendicitis with a different demeanor and ""a look on his face [like] nobody's covering me today,"" Terrell said.

""It was very encouraging,"" Terrell added.

And then, in his first game back from appendicitis at Tampa Bay, Harrison suffered a heel injury that kept him out for two more games.

In a sign to Terrell that Harrison had grown from his rookie year, he said Harrison was ""a lot calmer"" after his first heel injury than he was after the appendicitis.

""He [was] like, 'All right, there's a lot of things that happened that people will talk about or things that happened and I can't do anything about, so let me just take each day for what it is and try to capitalize on the day,'"" Terrell recalled.

After missing two games because of his first heel injury, Harrison returned for two games but left the Week 17 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals because of an injury to his other heel.

Dealing with that many injuries and fluctuating between the field and the training room wore on Harrison.

""Obviously, been a mental battle,"" Harrison said. ""I never really dealt with injuries before. Obviously, appendix, I can't really control that one at all. It just kind of happened at a bad time and then to injure both your heels is unfortunate, as well, but that's just kind of how the way things work sometimes, but you got to keep pushing forward.""

Harrison said rest is the key to his heels healing, but that won't prevent him from taking a break from football mentally early in the offseason.

Heading into last offseason, Terrell said he wanted Harrison to exhale and adopt the mantra of: ""I'm Marvin Harrison Jr. I'm a bad mother, and they got to feel me next time I'm out there.""

To some degree, Harrison heeded Terrell's advice. But heading into this offseason, Terrell wants much of the same out of Harrison as he did last year.

""There were a lot of moments this year where he had that look on his eye of like, this is what I do,"" Terrell said.

""So, I think for him, going into the offseason again, much like last year, enjoy the game, enjoy the process and focus on the process in what you can control, not outside noise, because that outside noise is always going to be there, good or bad. You got to treat good and bad the same and stay locked into what you do.""",https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1103%2Fr1570102_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 21:58:29.038807

The Broncos will need more production from their running backs against the Patriots, regardless of whether Dobbins is activated and able to contribute.","The Denver Broncos are opening the 21-day return-to-play window for running back J.K. Dobbins, a league source confirmed.

It is unclear yet whether Dobbins, who suffered a Lisfranc foot injury in early November and underwent surgery, will be activated to play in Sunday’s AFC Championship Game in Denver against the New England Patriots, but the opening of the veteran’s return window makes him eligible to practice with the team.

Dobbins was seen working last week on a side field during the media-viewing portion of practices for the first time since his injury, which occurred in Week 10 when he was dragged down by Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Tyree Wilson on what Dobbins claimed was a hip-drop tackle. A penalty was not called, and Wilson wasn’t fined for the tackle.

When surgery was scheduled after the injury, the league source said the hope was that Dobbins could be available if the Broncos reached the Super Bowl. Dobbins has been telling people inside team headquarters in recent weeks that he could return sooner. Coach Sean Payton said a week before Denver’s divisional round playoff win against the Buffalo Bills that Dobbins was “getting close.”

Despite not playing in the final seven games of the season, Dobbins still finished as the team’s leading rusher. His 772 rushing yards ranked fifth in the NFL through Week 10 and left him on pace to easily become Denver’s first 1,000-yard rusher since Phillip Lindsay in 2019. Dobbins ran for fewer than 60 yards only once in his 10 games.

“J.K. is a huge energy piece for our team,” right tackle Mike McGlinchey said Monday. “I’ll leave all the discussion up to the trainers and the staff on that, but he’s obviously a huge piece of what we’ve done. He’s an incredible teammate, and he’s been working his butt off to be able to have a chance to get back.”

Dobbins on Monday afternoon posted a picture to his Instagram account that depicted the running back emerging from the tunnel at Empower Field at Mile High. It had a one-word caption: Soon.

The Broncos will need more production from their running backs against the Patriots, regardless of whether Dobbins is activated and able to contribute. The team’s running backs carried the ball a combined 10 times for 41 yards in Saturday’s victory against the Bills, numbers that should increase with Denver starting backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham for the injured Bo Nix.

McGlinchey, who was the first Broncos player to speak publicly since the starting quarterback’s injury, called it “incredibly heartbreaking” to lose Nix after such a euphoric victory.

“It’s the crappy part of our game,” the veteran tackle said. “… He’ll be back better than ever when this is all said and done.”

McGlinchey also echoed the confidence Payton has voiced in Stidham since the injury. Stidham joined the Broncos as a free agent at the same time the right tackle did in 2023.

“Stiddy has been waiting for this moment the entirety of his career,” McGlinchey said. “He’s more prepared than anyone would be in this situation. He can ball. He flat-out can play quarterback. We’ve seen it every single day in practice. We’ve seen it in training camp. We’ve seen it in the preseason. I have no doubts that he’s going to go out there and play his butt off. Our team is in the perfect position with Stiddy moving forward.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/19152111/GettyImages-2234534935-scaled-e1768854100499.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-19 21:58:35.888346

1. Sean Payton announced Bo Nix has a fracture in his ankle: Nix injured his ankle on a two-yard loss in overtime, just before throwing a deep pass to wide receiver Marvin Mims that resulted in a pass interference, setting up a game-winning field goal. After the play, Nix came up limping slightly, and (looking back) he had a much more pronounced limp after centering the ball for kicker Wil Lutz's field goal attempt.

2. Bo Nix is scheduled for surgery on Tuesday: In his second media appearance of the night on Saturday, Payton confirmed Nix will have surgery on Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama, performed by Dr. Norman Waldrop. The surgery will end Nix's 2025 season, a campaign that ended up in the Broncos' and league history books.

3. Dr. Norman Waldrop is well-known among NFL quarterbacks: Dr. Waldrop was the surgeon who performed the turf toe surgery of Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow earlier this season. Burrow came back ahead of schedule, and played the final six games of the 2025 campaign. Dr. Waldrop has also worked on Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and former Tennessee Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill, among others. Waldrop has also worked with the New Orleans Saints.

4. Dr. Waldrop previously practiced in Colorado: Dr. Waldrop also practiced at Vail, Colorado's The Steadman Clinic, a center ""world-renowned"" for its surgeons & Orthopaedic Surgery. Waldrop was mentored by Dr. Thomas Clanton, who is known for his work on the foot and ankle. Clanton also served as the team orthopaedist for the Houston Texans.

5. Bo Nix's recovery timeline: As Payton is wont to do, he played the details of Nix's recovery close to the vest. “Listen, the surgeon gets his hands on the X-rays,” said Payton during a media conference call on Sunday. “We have enough information for everyone. The focus is on the next week’s game.”

For now, the Broncos will do exactly what Payton said, and turn their attention toward the Patriots. The two teams have been nipping at each other's heels through the regular season. Now, they are set to meet and play for the right to be the AFC's representative in Super Bowl LX, and Nix will focus on surgery and recovery.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/19/SBRC/88252888007-bo-nix-surgery-details.jpg?crop=4548,2559,x0,y161&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-19 19:59:52.399902

The Pro Bowl quarterback who played through an oblique injury on his non-throwing side while the Seahawks beat San Francisco in the divisional playoffs Saturday night came out the game fine.

That was coach Mike Macdonald’s update on Darnold Monday morning.

“To my knowledge, he’s good,” Macdonald said told KIRO-AM radio.

“He didn’t make it worse or anything. But I’m sure he’s sore.”

Darnold felt discomfort in his oblique on his left side Thursday during practice, throwing to a receiver “against air,” with no defenders. He immediately walked off the field into the team’s training room at its headquarters in Renton for treatment. Veteran backup Drew Lock ran the starting offense for the rest of that final, full practice before the 49ers game. Darnold didn’t throw from feeling it Thursday until about an hour and 45 minutes before kickoff Saturday afternoon.

He played into the fourth quarter. Lock replaced him near the end of the Seahawks’ blowout win. When asked following the Seahawks’ 41-6 victory that advanced Seattle into the NFC championship game Sunday against the Los Angeles Rams at Lumen Field what his level of pain was during Saturday night’s game, Darnold said: “I felt fine.”

Darnold said he and the team would need to continue managing the injury this week heading into him starting the NFC title game.

His coach said the same thing Monday morning.

“It’s something that we’re gonna have to navigate the rest of the week,” Macdonald said on KIRO.

It remains to be seen how much practice time Darnold misses and how much Lock runs the starting offense this week. “Navigating” the injury likely means Darnold won’t be on his normal throwing schedule Wednesday, Thursday and Friday leading into the Sunday title game.

Sam Darnold’s injury game

Saturday before the 49ers game, Lock and rookie third-stringer Jalen Milroe were Seattle’s quarterbacks on the field for early warmups in sweatsuits about an hour and 45 minutes prior to kickoff. Darnold wasn’t with them as he otherwise always is. He was inside, in the locker room, throwing passes in there to test his side.

He came out about 40 minutes before kickoff as usual with his teammates in full pads for final warmup drills. He softly threw passes then started the game, as he has all 18 games in his first Seahawks season.

Darnold completed 12 of 17 passes, 124 yards, with a dart of a touchdown throw through coverage to Jaxon Smith-Njigba. That put Seattle ahead 17-0 in the second quarter.

“Honestly, it surprised me. Not how hard he threw it because he was hurt. I was like, ‘Wow, how’s he going to fit it through this window,” Smith-Njigba said. “And he happened to do it, again. That was awesome.”

Darnold seemed to loosen up as the game went on. His first attempt in the game: A deep pass 20-plus yards down the seam he intended to throw to Smith-Njigba breaking free behind his defender for a possible touchdown. Darnold’s throw died softly, well short of the receiver and the 49ers defensive back.

That seemed to be on the quarterback’s mind later in that first offensive possession for Seattle. Darnold had Smith-Njigba breaking open deep early on a roll-out pass to the QB’s right. It would have been another 20-plus-yard throw. Instead, Darnold chose to throw an 8-yard pass to Cooper Kupp.

Seattle’s defense dominated San Francisco, and Darnold got the first postseason victory of his eight-year NFL career playing for five teams.

Charbonnet, 25, led the team with 12 rushing touchdowns during the regular season.

While Macdonald didn't reveal the exact nature of the injury, he said Charbonnet would face ""a long road back,"" potentially hinting at the running back missing time next season.

Throughout the regular season, Charbonnet and Kenneth Walker combined to give the Seahawks a fearsome rushing attack. The team ranked 10th in the NFL with 2,096 rushing yards in 2025. Walker led the way with 1,027 yards, but Charbonnet was the hammer, scoring 12 of the team's 19 rushing scores.

Since being selected in the second round of the 2023 NFL Draft, Charbonnet has emerged as a strong power option and the perfect complement to the shifty Walker. After a quiet rookie season, Charbonnet showed promise in his second year, rushing for 569 yards and scoring eight touchdowns while filling in for an injured Walker.

Both players stayed healthy in 2025, but that didn't stop Charbonnet from putting up the best season of his career. The third-year pro rushed for a career-high 730 yards and scored 12 touchdowns.

With the Seahawks securing the No. 1 seed in the NFC, Charbonnet was able to rest during the wild-card games. He returned to action against the 49ers, but carried the ball just five times for 20 yards in the contest. He left the game late in the first half, after taking a big hit. Macdonald said he was optimistic about Charbonnet's injury after the contest, but that the running back would undergo further evaluation.

The play shouldn’t have ever happened if the officiating crew had done its job earlier on that drive.

”You can’t blame the officials,” Brown said after the game. “That’s not what I try to do. But you’re letting the guys play all game long. I was holding the piss out of some people today and they didn’t call it. There was a third down right before we kicked the field goal -- I was holding Cooper hard and they didn’t call that. They were letting the boys play, but that’s a well-coached team. They knew where we were at and where they were at on the field. I think those passes were not really thrown to be caught. I think they were thrown to go out there and make us make a mistake and get a little help from the zebras. I thought they called a good game for the whole time. Those things are going to happen.”

He mentioned the hold on Jonathon Cooper and that was bad enough, but he smartly forgot about the worst no-call hold of the game. It came on that overtime drive and happened in the end zone.

If the refs do their job on that play, the game would have been over. The Denver Broncos would have won 32-30 and Bo Nix would be playing in the AFC Championship Game against Drake Maye. The storylines would have been amazing!

Instead, we get a week of the national media whining about an interception that seems pretty clear on reply. Sure you can grab a still shot of the ball not moving, but if you play it the ball is moving until one person gains possession of it. That person was Ja’Quan McMillian.

What they should be complaining about is how the Broncos were robbed of their franchise quarterback playing in the conference title game because the officiating crew refused to call holding penalties even for the most egregious acts of holding you’ll see in any game.

The Broncos are opening the practice window for running back J.K. Dobbins, and he has a chance to play, per ESPN. Dobbins suffered what was reported to be a season-ending Lisfranc injury to his left foot in November. It was a major hit for Denver, as Dobbins was averaging a career-high 77.2 rushing yards per contest and rushed for four touchdowns through the first 10 games of the season.

Despite missing the final seven games, Dobbins finished the regular season as the Broncos' leading rusher with 772 yards on 153 carries. Rookie RJ Harvey stepped up in his absence and rushed for 540 yards and seven touchdowns. Denver did not do much on the ground in the 33-30 divisional-round victory over Buffalo on Saturday, as Nix led the Broncos in rushing with 29 yards on 12 carries. Jaleel McLaughlin rushed four times for 21 yards, while Harvey rushed six times for 20 yards.

Here's a quick list of eight retired QBs the Broncos could call, with some more realistic than the others.
He will always be beloved by the Broncos, but Manning can't save the team this time.
Colin Kaepernick, 38: The Broncos, led by John Elway at the time, came close to trading for Kaepernick in 2016.
After adding Ben DiNucci to their practice squad, the Broncos have three healthy quarterbacks in Jarrett Stidham, Sam Ehlinger and DiNucci.","After losing quarterback Daniel Jones to a season-ending injury in December, the Indianapolis Colts brought a 44-year-old Philip Rivers out of retirement in an effort to save their playoff hopes.

Indy went 0-3 with Rivers as a starter and missed the postseason, but the veteran QB put in a respectable showing, completing 63% of his passes for 544 yards with four touchdowns against three interceptions.

Now, just over a month after the Colts lost Jones, the Denver Broncos have lost Bo Nix to a season-ending ankle injury. Rivers is not an option for Denver because he ended the season on Indy's roster, which means he won't be eligible to become a free agent again until March.

The Broncos also couldn't pursue Derek Carr, 34, because he's on the New Orleans Saints' reserve/retired list, and other QBs who ended the year on active rosters, including Aaron Rodgers, 42, and Russell Wilson, 37, (ha!), aren't eligible to join clubs as free agents until March.

And the most notable big name — Tom Brady (48) — is not eligible to play because he's a co-owner of an NFL team (the Las Vegas Raiders). And the list of free agents still available is very underwhelming.

So, who could Denver bring in? Here's a quick list of eight retired QBs the Broncos could call, with some more realistic than the others.

Retired quarterback options for Broncos

1. Tim Tebow, 38: Nix and Tebow are the only quarterbacks drafted by Denver who have won a playoff game with the franchise, but Tebow hasn't been in the NFL as a quarterback since 2015, and his attempt to convert to tight end in 2021 did not go well. He's not coming back.

2. Peyton Manning, 47: Manning still lives in the Denver area, and he helps the franchise as he's able to, but it's been 10 years since he won Super Bowl 50, and his performance was declining even then. He will always be beloved by the Broncos, but Manning can't save the team this time.

3. Drew Brees, 47: Brees, of course, won a Super Bowl with Sean Payton, but he said back in 2023 that his right arm ""does not work"" anymore, and he throws left-handed in his backyard. ""I don't throw with my right arm anymore,"" Brees told ESPN in 2023. ""If I could, absolutely I'd still be playing."" So he's not an option.

4. Colin Kaepernick, 38: The Broncos, led by John Elway at the time, came close to trading for Kaepernick in 2016. That was ten years ago, though, and he's been out of the NFL since 2017.

5. Robert Griffin III, 35: RGIII hasn't played in the NFL since 2020, but he told FTW's Prince J. Grimes in December, ""If someone called me, I could certainly play."" He's unlikely to get a call, though.

6. Andrew Luck, 36: What a story that would be. Seven years after retirement, Luck could return to lead Denver to a Super Bowl, continuing the legacy of ex-Colts QBs with the Broncos set by John Elway and Peyton Manning. If he was going to unretire, though, Luck likely would have done so years ago.

7. Nick Foles, 36: He officially announced his retirement in August 2024, but Foles knows what it takes to beat the Patriots in a championship game. One last ride?

8. Ryan Tannehill, 37: Of the QBs on this list, Tannehill feels like the most realistic option (but still not a likely candidate). He just officially announced his retirement in November, and a return to the NFL would not be as shocking as the other names above.

After adding Ben DiNucci to their practice squad, the Broncos have three healthy quarterbacks in Jarrett Stidham, Sam Ehlinger and DiNucci. Stidham is set to start in the AFC Championship game on Sunday, and Denver will probably stick with those three QBs for the rest of the postseason. If the Broncos are going to get a miracle at QB, it will come from Stidham stepping up and leading them to glory.","https://broncoswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/19/SBRC/88254943007-retired-nfl-quarterbacks-for-broncos.jpg?crop=2999,1687,x0,y265&width=2999&height=1687&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2026-01-19 18:59:31.884525

The news of this injury broke via head coach Sean Peyton just moments after defeating the Buffalo Bills on Saturday.

Surgery is required for Nix, who will head back to his home state to get the procedure done. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport revealed Dr. Norman Waldrop will be the one operating on Nix. On a national scale, he might be a familiar name for helping Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow earlier in the season. More locally, Waldrop does a lot of work with the Alabama Crimson Tide.

The New Orleans Saints count on him at the NFL level as well. Foot and ankles are Waldrop’s specialties, lining up quite well with the injury Nix just suffered.

As Rapoport mentioned, surgery is scheduled for some point on Tuesday. Nix will not get to play in the AFC Championship or the Super Bowl if the Broncos get there. The journey toward a return for the 2026 season will immediately begin.

With the injury, Nix just wrapped up his second season in the NFL after Denver took him in the second round of the 2024 NFL Draft. Individual and team success followed, winning 14 games during the regular season. Of course, the playoff win would not have been possible without Nix.

From a stats perspective, Nix threw for 3,931 yards, 25 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions on the year. Four games of at least 300 yards came, as did six multi-touchdown performances.

Coach Mike Macdonald said on his weekly show with KIRO-AM radio Monday second running back Zach Charbonnet has a “significant” knee injury that will require season-ending surgery.

Charbonnet was injured in the first half of Seattle’s 41-6 victory over San Francisco in the divisional playoffs Saturday night.

That win got the top-seeded Seahawks into the NFC championship game for the first time since January 2015. They will host the rival Los Angeles Rams Sunday at 3:30 p.m. at Lumen Field for a spot in Super Bowl 60 Feb. 8.

“The bummer is ‘Charbs,’” Macdonald said Monday morning on KIRO’s “Brock and Salk Show.” “He’s got a significant knee injury, unfortunately. Breaks your heart.

“So, he’s going to need surgery. He’s going to be our for...he’s got a good, long road to come back. But, our heart goes out to him, prayers go out to ‘Charbs.’”

Charbonnet had five carries for 20 yards including a 15-yard burst before he got hurt in the first half Saturday night. The third-year running back had three rushing touchdowns in the previous two games before Saturday. That included his second career 100-yard rushing day, 110 yards on 18 carries with two TDs running outside-zone plays in week 17 at Carolina.

Charbonnet has one season beyond this one remaining on his rookie contract.

Walker had Seattle’s featured running-back role to himself for the first time this season Saturday against the 49ers. And he romped. He gained 119 yards on 16 carries. Walker joined Shaun Alexander from 2004 as the only Seahawks to rush for three touchdowns in a postseason game.

Walker and Seattle’s running game has been rolling the last four games, with season-high totals in yards. The Seahawks need it even more with Pro Bowl quarterback Sam Darnold playing through an oblique injury.

This is the final season of Walker’s contract. He’s got another prime chance to state his case for a new deal, from Seattle or any other team, Sunday. It’s the first conference title game of his career, in front of the football world.

With George Holani still on injured reserve, the Seahawks’ options at number-two running back behind Walker are fifth-year veteran Velus Jones, called up from the practice squad for the 49ers game Saturday, and former Rams starting running back Cam Akers. Akers is also on the practice squad.

It just hurts, man, it hurts that it's going on, but he's going to be back stronger than ever, and the guys are going to pick him up. It's not like he's leaving us, he's going to be with us.""

Charbonnet, Seattle's second-leading rusher behind Kenneth Walker III, rushed for a career-best 730 yards and 12 touchdowns on 184 carries this season, becoming the first running back since Marshawn Lynch in 2014 to have double-digit rushing touchdowns in a season. Walker is currently the only healthy running back on the 53-man roster, but the Seahawks also have veteran backs Velus Jones Jr and Cam Akers on the practice squad. Additionally, George Holani, who has been on injured reserve since late November due to a hamstring injury, could be a candidate to return, though he has not yet be designated to return to practice.

""You could tell by his disposition after practice that he was like, 'There's no way I'm not playing his game,'"" Macdonald said. ""As the guy responsible for the whole thing, you're trying to make sure he's safe enough to play and all of that, you're trying to go through that process, but for the player, we had all the trust in the world, just seeing him, knowing that he's going to go through it and play. You could tell he's ready to go. And for a thrower, that is not a great injury, I'm sure he's feeling it, but he never wavered, never blinked, he's stone cold. He's tough as nails, and the guys recognized that. We knew it, he confirmed it again. A lot of respect for him.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/ni0nofwhkb02wrlpqdbf,N,,2026-01-19 17:00:51.015151

Stidham, 29, will get his first postseason start for the Broncos in the AFC Championship game against the Patriots next Sunday.

“Absolute whirlwind of emotions after the game last night,” Kennedy Stidham wrote Sunday in an Instagram Story post.

“Ultimately so proud of these boys & what they have accomplished this so far. do it for 10!!!!”

Kennedy also reshared a photo of Stidham that said, “Do it for Bo.”

Nix suffered a fractured ankle on a first-and-10 from the Buffalo 36-yard line with just over six minutes left to play in overtime of Denver’s 33-30 win over Buffalo.

He will undergo season-ending surgery Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama.

Nix finished 26-for-46 passing with 279 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.

Stidham appeared in one game this season, the Broncos’ 44-24 win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 8.

He has appeared in 20 games with four starts over his seven NFL seasons, but never a playoff contest.

Broncos head coach Sean Payton explained Sunday that he is more than confident Stidham is ready for the moment.

“I know how he was coached in New England. I know exactly how he was coached in New England,” Payton said. “And then I know how [Patriots OC Josh] McDaniels felt about him … but ultimately … it’s our three years here, our three years watching him day in and day out that you guys don’t have access to. He will be ready to go, and ready for the moment.

“One of Stiddy’s great strengths is his mental aptitude and his progressions and understanding play. There would be practices I’m looking at [DC] Vance [Joseph] getting pissed off because Stiddy’s making our defense look bad. He’s very accurate. He’s got a lot to his ball.”

Stidham went 1-1 in his last regular-season starts in the final two games of the 2023 season for Denver, when he filled in for a benched Russell Wilson.

A 2019 fourth-round pick, Stidham signed with the Broncos a month after they hired head coach Sean Payton in Feb. 2023.

Charbonnet was injured during the Seahawks’ 41-6 divisional-round win over the 49ers on Saturday.

As one half of a dynamic backfield duo with Kenneth Walker III, Charbonnet had 184 rushes for 730 yards and 12 touchdowns in 16 regular-season games, adding 20 catches for 144 yards.

Charbonnet had five rushes for 20 yards in Saturday’s game before exiting.

Walker led the way with 19 carries for 116 yards and three touchdowns as the top-seeded Seahawks dominated their NFC West rivals. Sam Darnold was 12-for-17 with 124 yards and a touchdown.

They’ll have to get through another divisional foe in Sunday’s NFC Championship game in Seattle as they face the Rams for a third time this season.

“He’s got a significant knee injury, unfortunately,” Macdonald said.
He’s got a good, long road to come back.” Charbonnet tore his ACL, a league source said.
After the game, Macdonald said Charbonnet would need an MRI to determine the extent of the injury.

“He’s got a significant knee injury, unfortunately,” Macdonald said. “Breaks your heart. He’s going to need surgery. He’s got a good, long road to come back.”

Charbonnet tore his ACL, a league source said.

The 25-year-old did not return to the game after being injured on an outside run in the second quarter. He spun off a tackle attempt by linebacker Dee Winters before being tackled by linebacker Eric Kendricks. Charbonnet was evaluated on the field and then in the medical tent before entering the locker room.

After the game, Macdonald said Charbonnet would need an MRI to determine the extent of the injury. He carried the ball five times for 20 yards and produced one first down before leaving.

A second-round pick in 2023, Charbonnet appeared in 16 of Seattle’s 17 regular-season games this year as Ken Walker III’s backup. He is the primary running back on obvious passing downs because of his pass-protection skills, and he often takes the bulk of the red-zone carries because of his physical running style. Charbonnet rushed for 730 yards and a team-best 12 touchdowns on 184 carries during the regular season, all career highs.

Walker shouldered more of the backfield load when Charbonnet went down and had his best game of the season against the 49ers, rushing for 116 yards and three touchdowns and tying his single-game career high. All three of Walker’s touchdowns came in the red zone; he had four such runs in the regular season.

Seattle’s other available running backs are Cam Akers and Velus Jones Jr. They’re both on the practice squad. Akers has not logged a carry as a Seahawk. Jones, who was active as the No. 3 running back Saturday, had four carries for 32 yards in Week 14.

Macdonald said quarterback Sam Darnold, who injured his oblique in practice Thursday and was questionable to face the 49ers, did not aggravate the injury in the game, though he said the issue will need to be managed through the remainder of the season. Left tackle Charles Cross, who left Saturday’s game in the third quarter and did not return “out of caution,” is day to day with a foot injury.

Macdonald had expressed optimism with the injury postgame before saying on his Seattle Sports 710-AM radio show Monday that Charbonnet will need surgery that will come with an extensive rehab.

""It breaks your heart,"" Macdonald said. ""He's going to need surgery. So, he has ... got a good long road to come back. Our heart goes out to him. Prayers go out to Charbs. We love him, man.""

Macdonald also said quarterback Sam Darnold is doing ""good"" after playing through an oblique injury against San Francisco, and that left tackle Charles Cross is day-to-day after leaving in the third quarter with a foot injury.

A second-round pick by the Seahawks in 2023, Charbonnet rushed for 730 yards and a team-high 12 touchdowns on 184 carries in 16 regular-season games while sharing the work in Seattle's backfield with Walker.

""This guy is the epitome of what it means to be a Seahawk,"" Macdonald said. ""Absolute tough as nails, great teammate, great human being, plays his tail off, detail-oriented, unselfish. This hurts, man. It hurts that it's going on, but he's going to be back. He's going to be back stronger than ever, and the guys are going to pick him [up].""

Charbonnet carried five times for 20 yards against San Francsico before suffering his injury late in the first half. Seattle then leaned heavily on Walker, who rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns on 19 carries before the Seahawks pulled their starters in the fourth quarter with the victory in hand.

Walker rushed for a team-leading 1,027 yards (4.6 yards per carry) during the regular season and played in all 17 games for the first time since Seattle chose him in the second round in 2022.

He'll now have to shoulder the load for the remainder of the Seahawks' playoff run, which continues this Sunday when they host the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game. Seattle's backup running backs are Velus Jones Jr., George Holani and Cam Akers. Holani is on injured reserve but is eligible to return.

As for Darnold, Macdonald echoed the quarterback's postgame comment about how he'll have to continue to manage his left oblique injury.

Charbonnet played the power role in the Seahawks offense behind starter Kenneth Walker III, rushing for 730 yards on 184 totes with a team-leading 12 rushing scores this season. His absence will be felt most in the red zone and short-yardage situations. He had five carries for 20 yards against San Francisco before getting knocked out with the injury.

Charbonnet's absence the rest of the way will mean the Seahawks will lean more heavily on Walker, who gashed the Niners for 116 yards and three touchdowns on 19 carries.

""Sean has done an admirable job of leading our football team for the past nine seasons,"" Pegula said. ""But I feel we are in need of a new structure within our leadership to give this organization the best opportunity to take our team to the next level. We owe that to our players and to Bills Mafia.""

McDermott couldn't get over the hump in the playoffs. The Bills reached the AFC title game twice over the past seven seasons but never got over the hump. During his nine seasons in Buffalo, McDermott won eight playoff games, the most postseason wins by any coach in NFL history without a Super Bowl appearance. With their three-point loss to Denver, the Bills became the first team in NFL history to lose three straight playoff games by three points or fewer.

McDermott's defense was a big problem in crunch time. In four of their past five playoff losses, the Bills held a fourth-quarter lead only to lose the game, an indictment of McDermott's defense. On Saturday, Buffalo led 27-23 with two minutes left before surrendering a 73-yard touchdown drive to the Broncos. And there was the famous 13-second game against the Chiefs, when Allen put Buffalo ahead 36-33 with a touchdown pass with 13 seconds left in the fourth quarter -- only for McDermott's defense to allow Patrick Mahomes to drive for a game-tying field goal. The Bills held a fourth-quarter lead in their last three playoff games against the Chiefs but ultimately lost all three.

McDermott did have a solid career in Buffalo. McDermott went 98-50 during his nine seasons with the Bills, with his 98 wins ranking second-most in NFL history by a coach during his first nine seasons with a team. He led Buffalo to the playoffs in eight of nine seasons, an impressive feat considering the Bills did not reach the postseason once in the 17 seasons before his arrival.

Bills coaching candidates. McDermott was a defensive-minded coach, but with Josh Allen as the star in Buffalo, it may be time for the Bills to hire an offensive-minded coach. If they go that route, several candidates could make sense. The Bills could promote offensive coordinator Joe Brady. Outside the organization, they could look at Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak, Rams passing game coordinator Nathan Scheelhaase, Mike McCarthy, Mike McDaniel or Kliff Kingsbury. The Bills could also bring back Brian Daboll, who served as Buffalo's offensive coordinator for four seasons (2018-21) and did an impressive job maximizing Allen's talents.

The NFL coaching cycle has officially gone off the rails this year. McDermott's firing means there will be 10 new coaches in 2026, tied for the most in a single offseason in NFL history (also in 1978, 1997, 2006 and 2022).

When the month began, six NFL coaches had 95 career wins or more. That number is now down to three, with McDermott, Mike Tomlin and Pete Carroll out of jobs.

With McDermott no longer in Buffalo, there are eight open head-coaching jobs. Interviews are still ongoing for each opening, including a scheduled interview between Mike McCarthy and the Steelers. If you want to keep tabs on all the interviews, we're tracking everything here.

2. Breaking down the divisional round: Bills go down in flames, Seahawks destroy 49ers

Since things got kind of crazy over the weekend, we thought it would make sense to at least take a brief look at what happened in each game, so that's what we're going to do here. We got two overtime games in the divisional round, which marked the first time since 2003 that we've gotten multiple overtime games in the second round of the playoffs.

With that in mind, let's take a brief look at each game:

(1) Broncos 33-30 (OT) over (6) Bills. This might have been Josh Allen's best chance at winning a Super Bowl, and he threw it away by turning the ball over four times in a three-point loss. Near the end of the first half, Allen made what was easily the most inexcusable mistake of the game and possibly the most inexcusable mistake of his career when he lost a fumble that set up a Denver field goal on the final play of the half (you can see the play here). The Bills turned the ball over a total of five times, and the Broncos scored 16 points off those turnovers -- clearly the difference in the game. One of Allen's turnovers came on an interception in overtime that set up Denver's game-winning drive. Of course, the biggest story from this game is the fact that Bo Nix fractured a bone in his ankle, and we'll have more on that in a little bit. You can check out our full takeaways from Denver's win here.

(1) Seahawks 41-6 over (6) 49ers. Rashid Shaheed returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, and the game was essentially over after that. The Seahawks defense absolutely suffocated the 49ers, forcing three turnovers while sacking Brock Purdy twice. The defense also kept San Francisco out of the end zone for the second straight time after also holding the 49ers without a touchdown in Week 18. With Sam Darnold dealing with an oblique injury, the Seahawks put their offense in the hands of Kenneth Walker III, who rushed for 116 yards and three touchdowns. We've got quite a few takeaways from this game, and you can check them out here.

(2) Patriots 28-16 over (5) Texans. The Texans' defense was the best in the NFL all season, but it was the Patriots' defense that stole the show in this game. The Patriots forced five turnovers, including a pick-six from Marcus Jones in the second quarter that gave New England an early 14-10 lead. Drake Maye had some fumbling problems, but he also came up with some huge plays, including a 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter that iced the win. The Texans are going to have to start asking themselves some questions about C.J. Stroud, who simply doesn't look like a franchise QB anymore. Stroud had a strong rookie year, but he's regressed ever since and he hit rock bottom in this loss with four interceptions. The Texans are now 0-7 in the divisional round in franchise history and are the only team in the NFL that has never made it to a conference title game. For more on New England's win, be sure to click here.

(5) Rams 20-17 (OT) over (2) Bears. The Rams pulled off a dramatic win that wasn't decided until Harrison Mevis drilled a 42-yard field goal in overtime. The only reason the game made it to overtime is because Caleb Williams threw a miraculous 14-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with under 30 seconds left to play (if you haven't seen the play, please stop what you're doing and check it out here right now). The Bears looked like they were going to pull out the win in overtime after driving to L.A.'s 48-yard line, but Williams threw an interception that set up the Rams' game-winning drive. Williams came up clutch at times, but he also threw three interceptions -- and that was a big reason why Chicago lost. We've got a full story on the Rams' wild win, and you can check it out here.

That leaves us with four teams left standing:

The Broncos are in the AFC title game for the first time since 2015, and coincidentally enough, they played the Patriots that year.

The Patriots are in the AFC title game for the first time since 2018. This marks the first time they've gotten there without Tom Brady as their quarterback since 1996.

The Seahawks are in the NFC title game for the first time since 2014.

The Rams are in the NFC title game for the first time since 2021. They ended up beating the 49ers that year on their way to a win in Super Bowl LVI.

If the Patriots make the Super Bowl, we'll definitely be getting a rematch because New England has already played both Seattle and Los Angeles in a prior Super Bowl. If the Patriots play the Rams, it will mark the third time the teams have met in the Super Bowl, which would tie Steelers-Cowboys for the most in NFL history.

3. Bo Nix injury details: Five wild options at QB for the Broncos

The most shocking moment of the divisional round came Saturday when Sean Payton revealed after Denver's win that Bo Nix would miss the rest of the postseason after fracturing a bone in his ankle. That now sets the stage for Jarrett Stidham to get his first start of the season.

Stidham only has four starts in his entire seven-year career and he hasn't thrown a regular-season pass in two years, so it's definitely a risky move for the Broncos to pin their Super Bowl hopes on an unproven quarterback. The Broncos are in a desperate situation and desperate teams do desperate things. Earlier this year, we saw the Colts sign 44-year-old Philip Rivers in hopes of saving their season after Daniel Jones went down with an injury. Rivers hadn't thrown an NFL pass in five years before signing with the Colts back in December.

With that in mind, I decided to take a look at a few wild QB options for the Broncos:

Ryan Tannehill. As crazy as it sounds, this might actually be Denver's most intriguing option. Tannehill hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since Week 18 of the 2023 season, which sounds like a long time ago, but his last pass actually came on the same day that Stidham threw his last regular-season pass. The best part for the Broncos is that Tannehill does have some playoff experience: He led the Titans to the AFC title game in 2019 and then one year later helped lead Tennessee to the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC.

Cam Newton. Newton hasn't played since 2021, but he's still only 36 years old, and the interesting part is that he hasn't officially retired. After the Colts signed Rivers in December, Newton was asked on his podcast if he'd ever be willing to return to the NFL after four years out of the league, and he made it clear that he would. Basically, Newton would be more than happy to answer the phone if Payton calls. During his career, Newton started 16 games against Payton's Saints, so the Broncos coach is certainly familiar with his work.

Drew Brees. If there's one name that Payton might toss around this week, it's Brees. The Broncos head coach spent 15 seasons in New Orleans with Brees as his quarterback, a span that included three conference title game appearances and a Super Bowl win in 2009. The only problem with calling Brees is that, apparently, his right arm isn't working anymore. Brees' right arm likely couldn't handle the rigors of an entire NFL season, but could it work for three weeks or even just one game? At age 47, Brees might not be interested, but it might be worth it for Payton to make a call just to check in on his former quarterback.

One player who won't be able to suit for the Broncos is Tom Brady. If you own part of an NFL team, you're no longer allowed to suit up for any team in the NFL, which eliminates Brady, who officially became a minority owner in the Raiders back in October of 2024. We've got a few more possible QB options for Denver, and you can check those out here.

If the Broncos do roll with Stidham, he'll become just the seventh quarterback in NFL history to make his first start of the season in the playoffs and second QB ever to make his first start of the season in a conference title game.

Here's the list of quarterbacks who were forced to start their first game of a season in the playoffs:

1972 NFC title game: Roger Staubach starts for Cowboys

1983 divisional: Gary Danielson starts for Lions

1992 wild card: Frank Reich starts for Bills

2012 wild card: Joe Webb starts for Vikings

2016 wild card: Connor Cook starts for Raiders

2020 wild card: Taylor Heinicke starts for Washington

The six quarterbacks on this list went a combined 1-5, with the only win coming from Reich in a game where the Bills pulled off the greatest comeback in NFL playoff history (they trailed the Oilers 35-3 before rebounding for a 41-38 win).

All four of the starts in Stidham's career have come in Week 17 or Week 18, when the team he was playing for had already been eliminated from the playoffs. He also hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since Jan. 7, 2024, which means he'll have gone 749 days without throwing an NFL pass by the time the AFC title game rolls around.

The Broncos signed Ben DiNucci on Sunday, which means their QB depth chart going into the week consists of Stidham, Ehlinger and DiNucci -- three quarterbacks with eight combined career starts who have gone 1-7 in those games.

4. Overreactions from divisional round: Did Josh Allen throw away his best chance at a Super Bowl?

Everyone on the internet loves to overreact to things, and that's especially true when we're talking about the NFL. With that in mind, Tyler Sullivan decided to take a look at several things that happened over the weekend to decide if we're all overreacting.

Statement: Josh Allen fumbles away his best chance at winning a Super Bowl.

Overreaction or reality: Reality. The 2024 NFL MVP didn't look the part in the loss to Denver, committing four turnovers (two fumbles and two interceptions). His back-to-back fumbles sandwiched in between halftime were egregious, and he seemed to force the ball down the field on his two interceptions, including the pick in overtime that helped set up Denver's game-winning drive. Allen and the Bills have squandered what will likely be their best opportunity to make it to and win a Super Bowl.

Statement: Broncos' Super Bowl hopes are done after injury to Bo Nix.

Overreaction or reality: Reality. While the Broncos will have home-field advantage in the AFC title game and they boast one of the best defenses in the NFL, this injury effectively ends any dreams of hoisting a Lombardi Trophy. Jarrett Stidham has been with the Broncos since 2023, so he's familiar with Payton's offense, but being thrust into a conference championship is too tall a task. The 29-year-old played one snap this season, taking a knee in October. He hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since 2023. To put it bluntly: It's hard to imagine a scenario where Stidham helps orchestrate a victory outside of the defense pitching a shutout.

Statement: Sean McDermott is on the hot seat.

Note: Tyler wrote this statement on Saturday night, and since he hit the nail on the head, we kept it in here.

Overreaction or reality: Reality. McDermott has the most playoff wins (8) without a Super Bowl appearance by a head coach in NFL history. While this is certainly productive for constantly being in the hunt, it's not maximizing what Buffalo has in Josh Allen during his prime years, which could make the Bills brass consider a change.

We've got several more overreactions from the divisional round, and if you want to check those out, we've got them here.

5. Early odds for the AFC and NFC title games

We'll be covering the AFC and NFC title games here all week, so I won't dive into these two games very much today. That said, I didn't want to completely ignore them, so here are the early odds for each game. Not surprisingly, the Broncos are a huge underdog.

Sunday, Jan. 25

(2) Patriots at (1) Broncos, 3 p.m. ET (CBS)

Current point spread: Patriots -5.5

For the third time in 13 years, the Broncos are hosting the AFC title game, and for the third time in 13 years, they'll be hosting the Patriots. The Broncos won each of the previous two meetings, and now they'll be looking to make it three in a row, but that won't be easy because Bo Nix won't be playing.

The expectation is that Jarrett Stidham will be the Broncos' starting QB, which is the big reason the Broncos are the largest home underdog ever in a conference title game dating to the AFL-NFL merger in 1970. The Broncos will need their defense to keep them in this game, and that will certainly be possible: Denver led the NFL in sacks during the regular season and will face a QB in Drake Maye, who took the fourth-most sacks in the NFL this year.

Sunday, Jan. 25

(5) Rams at (1) Seahawks 6:30 p.m. ET (Fox)

Current point spread: Seahawks -2.5

The Seahawks are hosting the NFC title game for the first time in 11 years, and they'll be facing a Rams team they're very familiar with. The two division rivals faced each other twice this season, with each team winning at home. Back in Week 11, the Rams beat the Seahawks 21-19 in a game where Sam Darnold threw four interceptions. The Seahawks then got their revenge during a wild Week 16 game that saw Seattle storm back from a 30-14 deficit in the fourth quarter in a 38-37 overtime win. Davante Adams didn't play in that Week 16 game, but the Rams will have him this time around.

This will also mark the second straight year that the Rams have gotten to face Sam Darnold in the playoffs. Last year, they tied an NFL playoff record by sacking him nine times in a win over the Vikings. This will mark the third time Sean McVay has led his team to the NFC title game, and he's gone 2-0 in his previous two games. This matchup will also feature the NFL's top-scoring offense (Rams) against the defense that gave up the fewest points during the season (Seattle). Since the merger, that has happened eight times previously in the conference round or later, and the top defense has gone 7-1.

You can check out our full story on the early odds for both games, along with an early preview of each one, here.

6. Extra points: Falcons have a new head coach

It's been a busy weekend in the NFL, and since it's nearly impossible to keep track of everything that happened, I went ahead and put together a roundup for you.

Falcons hire Kevin Stefanski. The Falcons made a big move over the weekend by hiring Kevin Stefanski as their new head coach. The former Browns coach, who was fired on Jan. 5, was out of a job for less than two weeks. The two-time Coach of the Year went just 45-56 during his six seasons in Cleveland, but he also did the impossible by leading the Browns to the playoffs twice. Stefanski has already made one decision in Atlanta and that's the fact that he'll be keeping Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich in the same role. We've got the full details on Stefanski's hiring here.

Matt LaFleur agrees to contract extension with Packers. There had been some speculation that LaFleur and the Packers might part ways this year, but that definitely won't be happening. CBS Sports NFL Insider Jonathan Jones has reported that LaFleur has reached an extension with the team. The terms of the deal haven't been reported yet, but LaFleur's contract was set to expire following the 2026 season and it seems highly likely that his extension will cover at least three years, if not longer.

Titans coaching job appears to be down to three finalists. After interviewing 15 people for their open coaching job, it appears that the Titans are down to three finalists. According to ESPN, those finalists are 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley and Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy. Saleh (Jets) and Nagy (Bears) are both former NFL head coaches while Hafley was a head coach at the college level (Boston College) before taking Green Bay's DC job.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/19/c54839e5-93d4-4dda-8e97-bff915d22cd3/thumbnail/1200x675/487c85f3fdb48a71d10d710fdb7b6beb/sean-mcdermott.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 15:00:53.939769

He wanted his team, by way of another press conference podium address, to hear from himself.
So Payton went back to the press conference room to announce Nix’s injury and surgery on Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama.
“I would have liked to have talked to the team first,’’ Payton said in a Zoom media call Sunday.
He was hobbling around in the locker room as Payton went to address the media on the win.","ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — When Broncos starting center Luke Wattenberg suffered a shoulder injury in a mid-December Sunday loss to Jacksonville, no one outside the team learned about it until he didn’t show up for practice the following Tuesday. The significance of the shoulder ailment wasn’t learned until Christmas afternoon when Wattenberg was placed on four-week injured reserve.

Sean Payton, the Broncos’ head coach, usually acts as if he’d rather divulge a family secret than reveal an injury before the official injury report comes out. So why did he announce his starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury a mere 65 minutes after he led the Broncos to a 33-30 AFC Divisional Round overtime victory against the Buffalo Bills, and that Jarrett Stidham would start in the AFC Championship Game against either New England or Houston?

The motivation, Payton said in so many words, was he feared the likes of 9NEWS would break the story. He wanted his team, by way of another press conference podium address, to hear from himself. So Payton went back to the press conference room to announce Nix’s injury and surgery on Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama.

“I would have liked to have talked to the team first,’’ Payton said in a Zoom media call Sunday. “But half the locker room had left. There’s no way that story survives until Monday when I talk to the team. I don’t want the team to hear from you all first or any national media first. Because that story is going to break in 24 hours.

“Now, if we were meeting this morning at 9 a.m., I wouldn’t have come back to see you. I would have addressed it after the team meeting. We discussed it [with public relations lead Patrick Smyth and general manager George Paton] and said, ‘Why don’t I just go in and tell everyone what happened?’ That seems to me like the smartest and easiest thing to do and be straight forward with it and at least the players are going to hear that from me on the podium and not from some national insider (or 9NEWS Broncos reporter) that gets it from an agent or gets from a doctor . You guys know the routine.

“And so I showered and then just came back in and we just felt it was the best way to handle it relative to the thinking being our own club, our own players.”

Nix’s injury was such that he either would have gone to his postgame press conference with the aid of crutches, or the team would have announced he was getting evaluated for an injury and couldn’t attend the press conference. Either way, 9NEWS would have got to the bottom of it. So Payton, in consultation with Smyth and Paton, elected for a proactive approach to get ahead of the story.

When did Payton first realize the severity of Nix’s injury?

“He gets hurt on the running play [with 6:04 remaining in the first overtime period], then we call the ‘Stutter Spears.’ We get the big pass interference penalty,"" Payton said. ""Then we center the ball, so he actually technically got hurt on his [fourth]-to-last play. He centers the ball for us, and then as he comes over, I kind of chest bump him, jab him like, ‘Freaking A!’

“And he’s like, ‘Careful.’ I’m like, ‘You all right?’ He said, ‘Yes, but it’s hurting.’ I said, ‘What do you got?’ He said, ‘My ankle.’ I said, ‘All right, you’ll be fine.’ And I jabbed him in the chest again. I said, ‘Just enjoy this field goal.’’’

Wil Lutz made the 24-yard field goal with 4:44 remaining in overtime, igniting a jubilant celebration from the crowd in the stands and Broncos on the field.

Afterwards, Nix conducted a quick, on-field network interview, then pointed his No. 1 fingers at the crowd rather than go through his usual high-five victory lap with fans on the west side of the stadium. He was hobbling around in the locker room as Payton went to address the media on the win. When Payton came back to his office, there was medical boss Beau Lowery, Paton and Smyth waiting for him in his office.

“AnI knew,’’ Payton said. “They didn’t say anything, but I knew there was something. We always meet after the game and discuss injuries, but that was early. They said, ‘Look, there’s a fracture.’ Showed me the X-ray. Immediately, I walked down the hall. Bo was kind of sitting outside the locker room, leaning up against the wall. His wife, his parents, family there, I think ‘Stidy,’ a few others.’’",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/ef1af5e7-a698-4160-9843-cdf9e86b8977/20260110T030654/ef1af5e7-a698-4160-9843-cdf9e86b8977_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 16:01:20.862844

Nix, 25, totaled 279 passing yards and three touchdowns against one interception in a 33-30 overtime win against the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs on Saturday.

He is expected to suit up but remains a low-floor fantasy play without a touchdown.","Another week in the NFL, another week of injuries that seemed to pile up. One of the final four teams now has to play the Conference Championship Game (and potentially the Super Bowl) with a backup quarterback, among other issues that happened this past weekend.

Bo Nix, Quarterback, Denver Broncos

Pat Bryant, Wide Receiver, Denver Broncos

Troy Franklin, Wide Receiver, Denver Broncos

There isn’t anywhere else to start but in Denver. Starting quarterback Bo Nix fractured his ankle very late in overtime against the Bills and will not be able to play the rest of the way. That means that Jarrett Stidham will have to start against the Patriots for just the fifth time in his career. With such a limited resume, it’s very difficult to know what to expect from Stidham in the pressure cooker of the AFC Championship.

On top of that, Stidham may or may not have his full receiving corps to work with. Both Pat Bryant and Troy Franklin left with injuries on Saturday. Bryant left with a concussion, so he will need to follow the steps in the NFL concussion protocol to return this week. Franklin had to deal with a hamstring injury, and the severity is being kept under wraps. Even if both receivers make it back, the road to the Super Bowl for the Broncos got infinitely more difficult without Nix.

Sam Darnold, Quarterback, Seattle Seahawks

Zach Charbonnet, Running Back, Seattle Seahawks

We found out last week that Sam Darnold injured his oblique in practice, leading to him not throwing a pass in the last two days of the week. Darnold played on Saturday, but I’m not sure if we got much of an answer on his injury. Since the Seahawks hammered the 49ers, Darnold only had to throw 17 times. He doesn’t seem in danger to miss this week. Seattle might be less sure about Zach Charbonnet, who left in the first half with a knee issue. Kenneth Walker III had himself a day as the lead back, so the Seattle offense had no reason to test out Charbonnet. We’ll have to see how the week goes to see if Charbonnet will be ready to play.

The field is smaller, the edges are sharper, and every mistake carries real weight. The Divisional Round is where the best teams reveal how much margin they have, because there are no soft landings left and no opponents just happy to be here. Roles condense, pressure ramps up, and game plans get honest fast. This is the point where efficiency beats volume, where situational usage matters more than name value, and where one decision can swing an entire slate.

This edition of The Report breaks down each matchup with that reality in mind and delivers a one and done pick for every game, grounded in how these teams score when everything tightens and the season is on the line.

Buffalo @ Denver

Josh Allen showed exactly why January turns into his personal stage in the Wild Card win over Jacksonville. Under pressure, he carved up the Jaguars by completing 9 of 12 passes for 144 yards, then leaned into his physical edge with 2 scrambles for 10 yards, 3 designed runs for 9 yards and 4 quarterback sneaks for 16 yards, including a 10-yard sneak that set up the winning sneak and two rushing scores. That willingness to take hits matters here because Denver brings heat at the second-highest pressure rate in the league at 40.7% and converts pressure to sacks at a 23.9% clip. Allen did get sacked on 24.5% of pressured dropbacks in the regular season, but he still averaged 7.1 yards per attempt and a 54.4% completion rate when hurried. His offense has leaned underneath, with Allen throwing short at a career-high 65.0% rate, and Khalil Shakir has been the engine there with 66 catches on 78 underneath targets for 564 yards and 3 scores while averaging 8.0 yards after the catch. Dalton Kincaid adds the downfield layer after leading all tight ends in yards per target at 11.7 and pacing the Bills on 10 plus air yard production, while James Cook III looks to rebound after a quiet Wild Card showing behind an under center run game that produced 36 explosive runs in the regular season. Best one-and-done play: Allen.

Bo Nix enters the matchup from the opposite end of the pressure spectrum, having faced the third-lowest pressure rate in the league at 27.7%, but the Bills present a tougher test after generating pressure on 35.3% of dropbacks and allowing just 5.0 yards per attempt when they get home. That matters because when Nix was pressured this season, he averaged just 3.7 air yards per completion, one of the lowest marks in the league. His offense has lived on yards after catch, piling up 2,183 YAC and getting more than half of its receiving yards that way, but Buffalo allowed a league-low 1,399 yards after catch across the regular season. Courtland Sutton remains the primary downfield threat after catching 37 passes outside the numbers for 603 yards and 4 touchdowns, though Buffalo allowed first downs on just 30.1% of throws outside the numbers. Troy Franklin’s screen role is built for YAC, but those lanes shrink fast against this defense. On the ground, RJ Harvey’s workload has grown to 13.7 carries per game since Week 11 and Buffalo does allow 5.1 yards per carry, but Harvey’s explosive run rate sits at just 5.5% and most of his fantasy value comes as a receiver, where he scored 5 touchdowns from the backfield and helped Nix post a 125.9 passer rating. Best one-and-done play: Harvey.

NFL Daily Dive — Jan. 16, 2026

Big playoff games are on deck, but the league never waits for the calendar to clear. The last 24 hours brought a coaching earthquake in New York, nonstop movement in the head coaching carousel, and several fantasy-relevant injury updates that could swing Divisional Round decisions. Let’s get caught up on everything that matters heading into the weekend.

Giants land their guy

John Harbaugh is headed to New York. The Giants are finalizing a five-year deal that will make Harbaugh one of the highest-paid head coaches in the league. He visited the facility, met ownership and sat down with Jaxson Dart before accepting the job. Any remaining interviews elsewhere are expected to be shelved. This is a massive culture swing for a franchise that has cleared nine wins only twice in the past 13 seasons. Harbaugh brings stability, credibility, and a baseline level of competitiveness that has been missing for a long time. The floor just rose dramatically. The next question is how high the ceiling goes in a conference that does not wait around.

With Harbaugh nearly locked in, attention turns to the offensive coordinator chair. Todd Monken is widely viewed as the early favorite, with interest also circling Mike Kafka, Nate Scheelhaase, Kliff Kingsbury and Tommy Rees. If Monken lands the role, it would be a strong signal that the Giants want to build an aggressive, modern offense around Dart. From a fantasy lens, this is a situation worth monitoring closely over the next few days.

Ravens keep casting a wide net

Baltimore added Mike McDaniel to an already large interview list. He remains one of the most intriguing offensive minds available, whether as a head coach or coordinator. A pairing with Lamar Jackson would be fantasy gold if it ever came together, though McDaniel still has plenty of options on the table.

Steelers coaching search expands

Pittsburgh continues to lean defense with its interview requests. Jeff Hafley and Ejiro Evero are both on the radar, joining a growing list of defensive coordinators tied to the opening. The Steelers also requested an interview with 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak, a notable departure from the trend. And yes, that’s Klay, not Klint. This is Kubiak’s first interview request for a head coaching job.

Scheelhaase stays hot

Nate Scheelhaase will interview with the Raiders, Steelers, Ravens and Browns in a single day. That is rare air for a 35-year-old coach who only jumped to the NFL two seasons ago. His rise has been rapid, and the Rams offense backing it up only strengthens his case. Even if a head job does not materialize immediately, an offensive coordinator leap feels inevitable.

Dolphins are busy

Miami wrapped interviews with Robert Saleh and Jesse Minter as it continues to explore a defensive reset. Saleh’s ability to keep San Francisco afloat despite injuries has earned him widespread interest, while Minter’s ties to the Harbaugh tree have made him one of the most in-demand candidates in the cycle.

Etienne future murky in Jacksonville

There is growing belief that Travis Etienne Jr.’s time with the Jaguars may be nearing its end. Contract decisions elsewhere on the roster appear to have clarified priorities, and internal expectations point toward Bhayshul Tuten as the lead back in 2026 if Etienne departs. Etienne profiles better as a committee option, but a strong market could still land him a fantasy-relevant role next season.

A.J. Brown trade talk brushed aside

Philadelphia’s front office gave the most non-committal response possible when asked about trading A.J. Brown: “He’s a great player.” But General Manager Howie Roseman went on to say great players are hard to find. That does not confirm anything, but it also leaves the door cracked open just enough to keep speculation alive.

Injury Ward

Sam Darnold (oblique) said he’s confident he’ll play against the 49ers this weekend. He’s still listed as questionable, but it sounds like this is more about managing it than any real fear of him sitting.

Josh Allen (foot/knee/finger) is not on Buffalo’s final injury report for the Divisional Round. He practiced fully the last two days and will be full-go against Denver.

Dalton Kincaid (knee/calf) is also off the Bills’ final injury report. He logged three limited practices, and while the floor is shaky, he’s still one of Allen’s more trusted targets.

Ty Johnson (ankle) is questionable for Saturday against the Broncos. He got in a limited session late in the week, which at least gives him a chance, but he still feels like a true game-time call.

DJ Moore (knee) was limited Thursday. This mirrors last week and it would be surprising if he didn’t suit up against the Rams.

Rome Odunze (foot) was limited Thursday after practicing fully last Thursday. He’s trending toward playing again, even if the volume hasn’t fully returned since he came back.

Ricky Pearsall (knee) is questionable for the 49ers’ game against Seattle. Limited work is progress after last week, but expectations should be tempered if he’s active.

Hunter Henry (knee) practiced fully Thursday. He should be on track to play against Houston.

George Kittle (Achilles) had surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon, and the early update is that it went well. That ends his playoff run and puts a major dent in his 2026 fantasy outlook until we get a clearer timetable.

Patrick Mahomes (knee) said his rehab is going well and that Week 1 is at least in the conversation. It’s a positive early update, but the real checkpoints will come once he ramps up in the spring and summer.

The playoff spotlight belongs to the players, but the coaching carousel is spinning just as fast. Harbaugh to New York is a franchise-altering move, and the ripple effects are only beginning. With Divisional Round games about to kick off, keep one eye on the field and the other on the news wire. Both are moving fast right now.

NFL Daily Dive — Jan. 15, 2026

The NFL news cycle does not slow down just because the playoffs are rolling. The Divisional Round is just two days away, coaching dominoes are still falling, and injuries are shaping how this weekend could look from both a real football and fantasy angle. Let’s run through everything that moved over the last 24 hours and what it means going forward.

Giants Closing in on Harbaugh

Momentum has finally reached the tipping point. Multiple reports indicate the Giants are on track to hire John Harbaugh as their next head coach, barring anything unexpected. The Titans and Falcons remained in contact late, but New York appears to have separated itself at the finish line. The Giants have the young quarterback in place, urgency across the organization, and a willingness to fully commit to the hire. If nothing changes, official confirmation should arrive soon.

Steelers Coaching Search Expands

Pittsburgh wasted no time widening the net after Mike Tomlin stepped away. The Steelers have requested interviews with Dolphins defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver, Rams defensive coordinator Chris Shula and Rams pass game coordinator Nate Scheelhaase. Weaver continues to draw steady interest after multiple near-misses in recent cycles. Shula has risen methodically through the Rams organization and oversaw a defense that consistently pressured quarterbacks this season. Scheelhaase may be the most intriguing name, having played a major role in a Rams offense that led the league in scoring and helped elevate Matthew Stafford into an MVP season. A sharp philosophical pivot may be exactly what Pittsburgh is looking for after years of stagnation.

Ravens Continue Casting a Wide Net

Baltimore remains one of the busiest teams in the market. The Ravens completed an interview with Chargers defensive coordinator Jesse Minter, who now has interviews or requests from nearly every team with an opening. Minter’s familiarity with the organization and his recent work slowing down elite offenses continue to fuel interest. Baltimore appears determined to leave no stone unturned as it searches for a coach who can reset the direction of the franchise.

Dolphins Head Coaching Search

Miami added two very different names to its list. The Dolphins requested interviews with Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady and Jaguars defensive coordinator Anthony Campanile. Brady oversaw a run-heavy Bills offense that leaned into physicality and could offer a very different look built around De’Von Achane Campanile, meanwhile, helped engineer a Jaguars defense that thrived on takeaways and discipline. Miami’s search continues to straddle both sides of the ball, with quarterback uncertainty looming in the background.

Atlanta will interview former Raiders head coach Antonio Pierce. Pierce lasted just one full season in Las Vegas after a rocky 2024 campaign, but his ties to the Falcons front office (he worked with Matt Ryan at CBS in 2025) and prior leadership experience earned him a seat at the table. He enters the process as a longer shot, but the Falcons continue to explore a wide range of profiles.

Arthur Smith Drawing Serious Interest

Smith’s name is gaining traction quickly. The Titans interviewed Smith for their head coaching vacancy, and the Cardinals followed by requesting their own interview. Smith’s history in Tennessee and his preference for a ground-heavy offense make him a natural philosophical fit there. Arizona’s interest signals a potential reset if the team moves on from Kyler Murray. From a fantasy perspective, a Smith-led offense would likely prioritize structure and rushing efficiency over explosive passing volume.

Eagles OC Search Taking Shape

Philadelphia has identified two top targets for its offensive coordinator opening. Mike McDaniel and Brian Daboll are both viewed as leading options if either fails to land a head coaching role. Either hire would bring quarterback-centric experience and immediate credibility. With elite weapons already in place, the Eagles job remains one of the most attractive coordinator openings in the league.

Rodgers Likely Done in Pittsburgh

Steelers owner Art Rooney II all but closed the door on Aaron Rodgers returning in 2026. Rodgers came to Pittsburgh specifically to play for Mike Tomlin, and with Tomlin gone, there is little incentive for either side to continue the experiment. Another offseason of speculation now looms as Rodgers weighs whether he wants to keep playing at all.

Adam Thielen Calls It a Career

Thielen officially announced his retirement after 12 NFL seasons. An undrafted local product who became one of the best receivers in Vikings history, Thielen finishes with nearly 8,500 receiving yards and 64 touchdowns. His peak years featured elite red-zone production and consistency. He leaves behind a career defined by reliability, toughness and production that far exceeded expectations.

Injury Ward

Josh Allen (foot) practiced fully after taking a heavy workload last weekend. He remains locked in as the top fantasy quarterback option for the Divisional Round, even against a strong Denver defense.

Matthew Stafford (finger) was a full participant despite a finger issue and is trending cleanly toward Sunday. The Rams will need him sharp as they face a high-powered Bears offense.

Nico Collins (concussion) did not practice and remains in concussion protocol after exiting last week’s game. If he cannot go, Christian Kirk and Jayden Higgins become strong fantasy option.

Dalton Kincaid (knee) logged another limited practice while managing a knee issue. He is expected to suit up but remains a low-floor fantasy play without a touchdown.

Ty Johnson (ankle) missed practice again and appears unlikely to return this week. His absence funnels even more work toward James Cook III.

Ricky Pearsall (knee) was limited again and is trending toward availability after missing last week. His status should be clearer after the final practice.

Rome Odunze (foot) practiced in a limited capacity and avoided setbacks last week. A fast-paced matchup could help keep his fantasy value afloat.

DJ Moore (knee) was limited but expected to play after producing through the injury last week. Game script could push his volume higher this weekend.

Terrance Ferguson (hamstring) practiced fully after missing last week and is on track to return, giving the Rams more flexibility at tight end.

Hunter Henry (knee) was limited but remains on pace to play. He finished the season strong and continues to offer steady tight end production.

The coaching carousel is still spinning, and the injury landscape is already shaping how this Divisional Round could unfold. As always, stay locked in because nothing stays quiet for long in January.",https://dmxvtdt4jwgem.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sam-Darnold-Seahawks-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 15:01:07.583029

The Broncos are signing veteran quarterback Ben DiNucci to their practice squad, according to a report from ESPN's Adam Schefter. He is expected to serve as their new third-string quarterback. There's no word yet on the team's corresponding move to make room for DiNucci on the practice squad.

DiNucci (6-2, 215 pounds) is a 29-year-old veteran who joined Denver in 2023 after starring in the XFL. He spent that season on the practice squad as the team's third-string QB behind Russell Wilson and Jarrett Stidham. DiNucci has spent time with three other NFL teams since then, mostly recently competing with the Atlanta Falcons during training camp last summer.

DuNucci is 0-1 as a starter in his NFL career, completing 53.5% of his passes for 219 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions. He led the XFL in passing yards (2,671) and ranked second in touchdown passes (20) while playing for the Seattle Sea Dragons in 2023.

After losing Nix, Denver plans to start Jarrett Stidham in the AFC Championship game next weekend. Sam Ehlinger, who had been serving as QB3, will now be bumped up to QB2 duties. Ehlinger turned down multiple active-roster offers from other teams this season to remain with the Broncos, and he's now their primary backup.

Denver will host the AFC Championship game on Sunday, Jan. 25.

For the season, Green Bay finished 12th in total defense, 18th against the run and 11th in both pass and scoring defense.
""Me personally, I know I got a lot more in the tank,"" Wyatt said.","GREEN BAY – Sitting at his locker last Monday with an orthopedic boot on his left foot, Devonte Wyatt was still wearing the aftereffects of the first major injury of his career.

The fourth-year defensive lineman saw a promising season end abruptly after sustaining a significant ankle and leg injury in Detroit on Thanksgiving.

The past seven weeks haven't been easy, but Wyatt has found a way to keep smiling.

""It's been tough,"" Wyatt said. ""I wish I was there but kind of talked to God about it, talked to my family about it. Now I'm in a better space.""

The 2022 first-round pick was off to yet another strong season before injuries mounted. First, Wyatt missed two games in October due to a knee injury suffered against Dallas in Week 4.

Once he started regaining form, Wyatt then broke his fibula and suffered torn ligaments in his ankle late in the Packers' thrilling 31-24 Thanksgiving win over the Lions. Wyatt said he's facing a three-to-five-month recovery timeline.

Despite missing the final five games of the season, Wyatt still finished third on Green Bay's defense with four sacks to push his career total to 16 in 57 NFL regular-season games.

The injury has been eye-opening for Wyatt. It has reminded him how much he loves not only the game of football but also his teammates.

After three years shadowing three-time Pro Bowler Kenny Clark, Wyatt moved to the head of the table in the defensive line room after Clark was sent to Dallas as part of the trade that brought perennial All-Pro Micah Parsons to Green Bay in late August.

Wyatt took that responsibility seriously – both with his play on the field and inside in a young position room. Until former linemate Jonathan Ford re-joined the team in late December, Wyatt was Green Bay's only interior defensive lineman older than 25 years old on the active roster.

""When they see me, they be like, 'Oh man, we miss you D-Wy,'"" Wyatt said. ""It makes me feel better knowing they miss me, knowing my guys miss me.""

One player with whom Wyatt has built a bond in the training room is Parsons, who's currently rehabbing from the torn anterior cruciate ligament he suffered last month in Denver.

Parsons was a vocal supporter of Wyatt from the moment he came to Green Bay, frequently mentioning the impact Wyatt had in the interior and how his efforts complemented the edge rush.

When Wyatt went down in Detroit, Parsons didn't equivocate while discussing in the post-game locker room how devastating the loss of the 6-foot-3, 304-pound defensive lineman was for the defense moving forward.

""You guys see the difference he makes when he got back out on the field. He's a player you can't replace,"" said Parsons on Thanksgiving. ""It's going to be challenging but we're going to have to really dial into our details, our fundamentals to try to replace someone that's unreplaceable.""

The Packers mixed and matched personnel after Wyatt's departure, but their struggles were reflected in the superlatives.

Statistically, the defense ranked fourth in total yards, six vs. the pass, eighth vs. the run and sixth in scoring before Wyatt's injury. For the season, Green Bay finished 12th in total defense, 18th against the run and 11th in both pass and scoring defense.

While many factors played into that, it's obvious the toll injuries took on the defense during the final month of the year. As he works his way back, Wyatt wants to be part of the solution.

Green Bay exercised Wyatt's fifth-year option last summer, guaranteeing he'll return for another year, and the burgeoning defensive lineman wants it all – from Pro Bowls to Super Bowls.

He just needs that ankle to heal up. Once it does, Wyatt feels like there is boundless potential for himself and this defense.

""Me personally, I know I got a lot more in the tank,"" Wyatt said. ""I feel like I got a lot more in the tank than what I put out there this year or the past three years. I know I have a lot more and I feel like this injury right here really is going to help me get above this hump, just showing y'all what I have.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/packers/r5aghi9cgivyvpzsf673,N,,2026-01-19 15:01:11.393991

Denver's future odds also took a massive hit because of Nix's injury.
Going into Saturday, the Broncos were +700 for the Super Bowl, per DraftKings, and immediately following their win over the Buffalo Bills, they were +370.
It would be the longest odds to win the Super Bowl entering a conference championship since the New York Giants (+1500) in January 2008; the Giants famously went on to win it all that year.
The Seahawks lead the way on the Super Bowl board heading into the conference championship games, with +145 odds, followed by the Rams at +225 and the Patriots at +255.","The NFL's final four is set and the betting lines are not what many would have expected before the season -- or even before the past weekend.

The New England Patriots opened as 4.5-point road favorites over the Denver Broncos for the AFC championship, while the Seattle Seahawks opened as 1.5-point home favorites over the Los Angeles Rams for the NFC championship, according to DraftKings lines. After early betting, New England jumped out to -5.5 and Seattle to -2.5.

In lookahead hypothetical lines, the Broncos were 1.5-point favorites over the Patriots, but they saw their odds drop precipitously following the news that quarterback Bo Nix would miss the remainder of the postseason with a fractured right ankle. Bookmakers polled said that Nix is worth anywhere between five and seven points to the spread.

""We're looking forward to seeing how these two defensive-minded teams match up in the AFC championship and evaluating just how big of an impact Bo Nix had on this Broncos team throughout the year,"" Caesars Sportsbooks head of football Joey Feazel told ESPN. ""We're also eager to see where the sharps ultimately land on this game.""

Early sharp action could have had an influence on making the Pats even bigger favorites. John Murray, vice president of the Westgate SuperBook in Las Vegas, said he was ""surprised to see how big of a favorite New England pushed out to [on Sunday].""

If the 5.5-line holds, New England would be the largest road favorite in a conference championship game since the 1970 AFL/NFL merger, according to ESPN Research.

Denver's future odds also took a massive hit because of Nix's injury. Going into Saturday, the Broncos were +700 for the Super Bowl, per DraftKings, and immediately following their win over the Buffalo Bills, they were +370. They lengthened to +650 in the immediate aftermath of the Nix news, then to +950 by the end of Saturday, before finally settling at +1100. It would be the longest odds to win the Super Bowl entering a conference championship since the New York Giants (+1500) in January 2008; the Giants famously went on to win it all that year.

The Seahawks lead the way on the Super Bowl board heading into the conference championship games, with +145 odds, followed by the Rams at +225 and the Patriots at +255.

All of these teams began the season as relative long shots: Denver and Los Angeles were each +2200, while New England and Seattle were each +6000. Either of the former two teams winning would represent the longest preseason odds since the 2017 Philadelphia Eagles (+4000), and either of the latter two would mark the longest since the 2001 Patriots (+6000).

With many of the public's Super Bowl favorites eliminated, there is little left for sportsbooks to sweat, but there are at least a couple of liabilities still on the board: BetMGM said that a Seahawks Super Bowl win would be its worst outcome, while DraftKings points to a Patriots win as its worst.

Speaking of postseason football, we have heaps of NFL storylines to address after a divisional round that featured a little bit of everything, including two overtime thrillers.

Let's get to it.

🩼 Five things to know Monday

The NFL's conference championship games are set, and Bo Nix will watch from the sideline. The Broncos will play for the AFC Championship, but they'll do so without their starting quarterback in action. Nix fractured a bone in his ankle on the penultimate play of overtime in their divisional round win over the Bills and is scheduled to have surgery on Tuesday. Jarrett Stidham is in line to start just his fifth career game and make his first pass since the 2023 season when Denver hosts the Patriots, who defeated the Texans in a turnover frenzy. On the NFC side, the top-seeded Seahawks obliterated the 49ers to punch their ticket to the conference title game against the overtime-winning, drama-surviving Rams.

Bo Bichette agreed to terms with the Mets. The dominoes continue to fall in free agency after Kyle Tucker signed with the Dodgers. Bichette immediately became the biggest target on the market, and it did not take long for the Mets to pivot onto the shortstop after missing out on Tucker. The parties agreed to a three-year contract worth $126 million which includes opt-outs after the first and second seasons, no deferrals and a full no-trade clause. This figures to be the first of multiple moves for New York, while the Blue Jays are next up after missing out on their top two targets. The Phillies also shifted their focus and re-signed J.T. Realmuto to a three-year deal.

Kevin Stefanski will take over the Falcons, while Matt LaFleur remains with the Packers. Less than two weeks after his firing in Cleveland, Stefanski found a landing spot in Atlanta. The two-time AP Coach of the Year will be tasked with snapping the Falcons' eight-year playoff drought. LaFleur, meanwhile, agreed to a multi-year extension to remain in Green Bay, ending the uncertainty that swirled after his latest postseason hiccup, which dropped him to 3-6 in playoff games.

The transfer portal closed, but not before Darian Mensah departed from Duke. The Blue Devils made Mensah one of the highest-paid players in college football last offseason, but he is out after just one year and is now the most highly sought-after player in the portal. Miami is aggressively shopping for a quarterback and is a team to watch in Mensah's recruitment, according to CBS Sports' Chris Hummer and Matt Zenitz. Mensah's last-minute portal entrance at the Friday deadline wrapped up the 2026 window.

The Golden Knights traded for Rasmus Andersson. Perceived as the best defenseman available on the trade market, Andersson is headed to Las Vegas in return for a 2027 first-round pick, conditional 2027 second-round pick, defenseman Zach Whitecloud and defensive prospect Abram Wiebe. Barring a contract extension, Andersson is essentially a rental to fill the spot in the top four vacated by injured Alex Pietrangelo. The Flames agreed to retain 50% of his remaining contract.

🏆 Do not miss this: College football will crown a national champion tonight

Miami fans could be in for their best night in 25 years. While the Indiana faithful might enjoy the highlight of their entire fandoms. Either way, the winner of Monday's College Football Playoff National Championship will snap a lengthy title drought. And for those fortunate enough to secure historically expensive tickets, seeing their team hoist the trophy should be worth every penny.

Here's what to expect in the championship game:

Expert picks: The majority of our college football panel is riding with Indiana to not only win the national championship but to do so by a wide margin. See why Tom Fornelli, Chip Patterson and others foresee a blowout victory incoming for the Hoosiers.

Tale of the tape: Two of the three most accurate quarterbacks in the nation go head-to-head in this matchup. A pair of outstanding defenses will duke it out. So who has the edge? We have the answer for every position.

Keys to the game: Miami's biggest key to victory is that the pass rush has to be dominant. For the Hoosiers, protecting the ball is one of five necessities.

What's at stake for Miami: National championship No. 6 is within reach for the Hurricanes. The 2025 squad can stake its claim as one of the greatest teams in program history if it wins one more game. Freshman sensation Malachi Toney can put a bow on a remarkable debut season, too, and set the stage for more title runs in the years to come.

What's at stake for Indiana: Curt Cignetti is already a legend for turning a historically downtrodden program into a two-time playoff participant. Winning the national championship would make his efforts one of the greatest sports stories in American history. His quick turnaround of the Hoosiers is nearly unmatched by any team, collegiate or professional.

🏈 NFL divisional round fallout, conference championship lookahead

Is the Super Bowl window closed for the Bills? That may be more reality than overreaction after their loss to the Broncos, wherein Josh Allen committed four turnovers. The window is wide open, though, for their AFC East rivals. The Patriots overcame three turnovers of their own to defeat the Texans, and with a Bo Nix-less Denver squad awaiting them in the conference championship game, everything is ahead of them.

Looking ahead to next weekend …

The Seahawks are a machine on an eight-game winning streak. They'll look to make it nine straight against their NFC West rival Rams, who survived an overtime scare and remain in search of another Super Bowl for potential MVP Matthew Stafford. On the other side of the bracket, the Patriots continue to beat good teams and squash the narrative about their favorable regular-season schedule. If they beat the Broncos, though, expect a few naysayers to discredit them for taking down a backup quarterback.

As for the teams whose seasons came to an end …

Are the 49ers' best days behind them? Kyle Shanahan has overseen a prolific run, but the blowout loss to Seattle indicates the title-chasing era in San Francisco may be winding down. That looks to be the case in Buffalo, too. Allen was in tears postgame after a heartbreaking overtime defeat, which halted his postseason run short of the Super Bowl for a seventh consecutive year. Young talent could keep the Bears and Texans in contention over the years to come, though. What Caleb Williams achieved on a miracle touchdown in Sunday's defeat alone is enough to spark optimism for 2026.

👍👎 The best (and not-so-best) of the rest

New England receiver Mack Hollins is eligible to return from injured reserve this week, meaning he could play at Denver on Sunday. Hollins missed the last four games, including both playoff wins, due to an abdominal injury suffered during the Patriots’ Week 16 road win over the Baltimore Ravens.

It remains to be seen whether Hollins will be on the field when the Patriots practice on Wednesday. ESPN’s Mike Reiss offered a minor update on Hollins in his notes column published on Sunday.

“He’s around in all the meetings and we talk a lot about the things he might see with the upcoming opponent, and he’s been helping Efton (Chism III) with some stuff,” Patriots receivers coach Todd Downing said last week, via Reiss. “He’s definitely staying around and involved.”

Hollins was having one of his best seasons before suffering the injury. The 32-year-old posted 46 catches for 550 yards — his career highs are 57 catches and 690 yards — along with two touchdowns in 15 games. As perhaps the Patriots’ best blocking wideout, Hollins was also a key, physical presence in the running game.

Are the Colts being too confident about Jones' availability for the start of the 2026 season?
In any case, barring a stunning turn of events, Jones will be the Colts' starting quarterback in 2026.
Said Ballard: ""I think Daniel Jones has got a really bright future here in Indianapolis.""","INDIANAPOLIS -- A month after Daniel Jones sustained a right torn Achilles tendon, with his rehabilitation barely underway and his lower leg still entirely immobilized, the Indianapolis Colts quarterback was wheeling his way around NRG Stadium in Houston, roughly 1,000 miles away from the comforts of his living room.

Jones didn't need to be there.

It was the final game of the season, with the Colts already eliminated from the playoffs. And navigating his way onto the team flight, with his right leg of little use to him, could not have been easy. What's more, Jones is headed for potential free agency in the spring, as he is not under contract with the Colts for 2026.

And, yet, there was, doing what he could to help rookie quarterback Riley Leonard, conducting himself like a player very much invested in his team.

""He's in every meeting,"" coach Shane Steichen said a few days prior to the season finale. ""... He comes to every practice. He's always around. Still in the QB meetings. Off days, he's in the QB room, studying the tape, preparing, even though he's not playing. Still going through everything. So, he's still fully engaged.""

When asked about his presence, Jones joked, ""It's not like I'd be doing anything else.""

The whole scene said quite a bit about Jones' intentions for the future. He wants to be in Indianapolis, and the Colts concur. On that much, everyone agrees.

But that's where the questions begin.

Among them: How will negotiations play out given Jones' significant injury? Does signing Jones to a multiyear deal make sense, and how much skepticism should the Colts have that Jones will be ready for the start of the 2026 season?

Jones had a career year in the 13 games he played before his injury, with career highs in passing yards (3,101), yards per attempt (8.1), completion rate (68%) and QBR (63.5). He knows coming back to Indianapolis to pair with Steichen and his offensive expertise makes sense.

""I learned a lot, I think, just being around these coaches,"" Jones said, ""being in the system, learning from Shane, learning from everybody here. Very, very grateful and appreciative of everyone and the experience here.""

At the same time, Jones acknowledges the realities that lie ahead.

""Obviously, there's a business side to it, and I understand that,"" he said.

When Jones was rolling along pre-injury, with the Colts lighting up scoreboards and ranking among the best offenses in the league in numerous categories, Jones seemed headed for a very lucrative deal in the spring. But the injury complicates things at least a little, even if the Colts maintain he will emerge just fine.

Asked whether the injury impacts the negotiations, general manager Chris Ballard said, ""Of course. But we'll work through that with his agent.""

There are bound to be some variables that will need to be confronted during contract talks. The Colts, for example, might wish to be conservative with guaranteed money given the uncertainty the injury creates. How Jones' camp responds is a key question. If consensus is hard to achieve, does the franchise tag -- projected to be north of $45 million for one year -- come into play?

A related issue: What is the appropriate length of the contract? The Colts think Jones has the potential to be a solution at quarterback for the foreseeable future, with Ballard saying, ""I'm looking at him both near and long [term]. ... When you're chasing the quarterback all the time, it makes it very hard. Like, your margin for error really shrinks down. And I feel very good about Daniel Jones and where he's at, where he's going.""

As for the injury itself, the Colts are extremely optimistic. Jones, for his part, has little doubt about the outcome despite the injury occurring on Dec. 7.

""I think, obviously, it's a long process in recovery and there's a time frame to it,"" he said. ""You've got to check a lot of boxes along the way, but I expect to be ready to go by training camp. So, we'll attack the process and make sure I'm ready to go.""

Said Ballard: ""I do feel confident that he will make it back. Will he be the version you saw right away? Maybe not, but he's still going to be really good. I think as he goes along and plays, he'll be fine.""

Are the Colts being too confident about Jones' availability for the start of the 2026 season? The Colts are taking their cues from other quarterbacks who have successfully bounced back from the injury.

That list includes Atlanta's Kirk Cousins, who tore an Achilles in Week 8 of the 2023 season and returned for the start of 2024 season. He played at an acceptable level, completing 65% of his attempts and averaging 216 passing yards per game in the first month of the season.

Aaron Rodgers, then with the New York Jets, had a full year to recover from an Achilles injury heading into the 2024 season. He started well enough, completing 64.1% of his attempts and averaging 212 passing yards in his first month back. Rodgers has offered Jones advice on attacking his rehab during phone conversations in the weeks since Jones was injured.

But there are also horror stories, like that of Cleveland's Deshaun Watson. He re-ruptured his Achilles during rehab following his original October 2024 injury. That issue is considered a rare occurrence among athletes who undergo surgical repair, as Jones and these other quarterbacks have.

The Colts are still evaluating what other quarterback moves they might make, but they currently seem inclined to consider Leonard as a backup option to Jones in the event there are delays in his recovery. The future of Anthony Richardson Sr., the team's 2023 first-round pick, is uncertain.

In any case, barring a stunning turn of events, Jones will be the Colts' starting quarterback in 2026.

It was like stealing candy from a baby as Mims ran right past Jackson and Nix delivered a dime.
“Every year there’s injuries, you expect the injuries, it is a part of the game, but the amount we’ve had this year is significant,” he admitted.","DENVER - Almost from the moment the Buffalo Bills stepped foot on the grass fields at St. John Fisher University, injuries became one of the biggest storylines of their flawed and doomed 2025 season.

The parade of players going down was something unlike we’ve ever seen, at least that I can recall in my four decades plus covering this team.

Sure, maybe there were worse seasons, I can’t remember them all at the top of my head, but 2025 is fresh in my mind, and I don’t think it’s even up for debate that the amount of man-games the Bills lost due to injury is as big a reason why their season came to a catastrophic finish Saturday night with a 33-30 overtime loss to the Denver Broncos.

How injuries defined the Bills 2025 season

It began with Tyler Bass being unable to kick in training camp, ultimately resulting in him missing the entire season, and it ended late in the fourth quarter against the Broncos, with the Bills trying to hold on to a 27-23 lead. Tre’Davious White suffered a stinger and left the field for just one play, but what a fateful play it was as Denver coach Sean Payton attacked his replacement, Dane Jackson, and the result was a go-ahead Bo Nix to Marvin Mims touchdown with 55 seconds left in regulation.

Injuries. They crushed the Bills all year, right down to the bitter end.

According to Rotowire, the Bills lost 246 games to injury which was actually only the fifth-highest total behind the Cardinals (303), Lions (274), Dolphins (265), and 49ers (254). However, there were some big-time players who went down and Ed Oliver, Michael Hoecht, Dalton Kincaid, DaQuan Jones, Terrel Bernard, Shaq Thompson, Matt Milano, Max Hairston, TJ Sanders, Taylor Rapp, and Taron Johnson all missed multiple games.

Buffalo Bills depth stretched thin in the moments it mattered most

Look at what happened in this game alone. It’s almost incomprehensible how bad Buffalo’s injury misfortune was.

“We’ve been rolling dice in the lineups all season long and nobody shied away from going out there,” coach Sean McDermott said after the game, trying not to use injuries as an excuse because he wouldn’t do that. “Nobody shied away from doing their job, trying to do their job to the best of their ability.”

But that’s the thing. Because of all the injuries, the Bills had to use players in too many situations all year, and specifically in this loss, who had no business being on the field. Here are three clear examples, all of which played a huge role in the defeat.

▶ In the second quarter, on the play where James Cook fumbled, center Connor McGovern suffered a head injury and had to be evaluated for a concussion. While he was in the locker room, Alec Anderson took over at center on the next Bills’ possession.

They drove to the Denver 14 and had a second-and-9, and Anderson one-hopped a shotgun snap to Josh Allen who corralled the ball but ultimately could not escape being sacked for a four-yard loss by Malcolm Roach. That killed the chance for a possible touchdown, and the Bills wound up settling for a Matt Prater field goal that tied the game at 10-10.

▶ On Denver’s ensuing possession, safety Cam Lewis - who started the game in place of Jordan Poyer, who became the starter after Damar Hamlin took over for the original starter Taylor Rapp who had been lost for the season months ago - suffered a leg cramp and had to leave the field. His replacement was Darnell Savage, who wasn’t even on the team until early December.

Knowing Savage was out there, Payton was licking his chops and he called a deep shot over the middle with wide receiver Lil’Jordan Humphrey running a post into Savage’s coverage area. Nix went right there, Humphrey beat Savage and reeled in a 29-yard TD for a 17-10 lead.

“It’s partly on them,” McDermott said of his players, “but give (the Broncos) credit for attacking where there was somebody who wasn’t the player who’s normally there.”

▶ And then came the Jackson play. White was hurt when Nix ran to convert a third-and-4 and went to the sideline, even though he felt he could have kept playing.

“I caught a stinger,” White said. “You’ve got to get checked for a concussion once you get one of those. Kind of just wasting my time.”

With Maxwell Hairston injured and not available, the Bills turned to Jackson who had been elevated from the practice squad, a player who played only six snaps of defense all season, all on days when he was called up from the practice squad due to injuries.

Even though scoring quickly left Allen nearly a minute to produce a possible tying or winning drive, Payton saw blood in the water and had Nix go right at Jackson. It was like stealing candy from a baby as Mims ran right past Jackson and Nix delivered a dime.

“It’s man-to-man coverage. I’ve got to win,” Jackson said. “(Mims) pretty much ran a double move, I’ve just got to win. I’ve got to make a play. I mean, pretty much that simple from my standpoint.”

What Sean McDermott and Josh Allen said about the injury toll

Days before the game, I asked McDermott if he could recall a season where one of his teams has dealt with the amount of injuries this one had.

“Every year there’s injuries, you expect the injuries, it is a part of the game, but the amount we’ve had this year is significant,” he admitted.

As a teary-eyed Allen said after regarding what the Bills endured across 19 games, during which they never once had their full complement of starters on the field together, he said, “It’s been a long season.”

If the Broncos are going to activate Dobbins or Wattenberg (or both) from IR in time for the Patriots game, the first step would be a return to practice.","The Denver Broncos were hit hard by injuries during Saturday's 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills.

Starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury that will require surgery on Tuesday. That leaves Jarrett Stidham as the next man up as Denver's new starting quarterback as they prepare to host the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game next weekend.

In addition to Nix, at least three other Broncos players suffered injuries on Saturday.

Denver wide receiver Pat Bryant left with a concussion in the first quarter. Bryant posted ""I'm back spinning 😈"" on his Instagram story, which is hopefully a good sign, but after two concussions in less than a month, Bryant is no guarantee to be available for the AFC title game.

Fellow receiver Troy Franklin left in the second quarter with a hamstring injury and center Alex Forsyth left with an ankle injury in the fourth quarter.

""Both teams were nicked up,"" Broncos coach Sean Payton said after the game. ""They were nicked up coming in, and we got nicked up quick. Pat is out, and then pretty soon Troy Franklin’s out, and then you’re down to three receivers. We took [Marvin] Mims off kick return after that happened.""

We should learn more about the severity of the Franklin and Forsyth injuries when Denver returns to practice on Wednesday. That will also be a significant day for running back J.K. Dobbins (foot) and center Luke Wattenberg (shoulder), who remain on injured reserve but were spotted doing rehab work on a side field at practice last week.

With Forsyth ailing, a potential Wattenberg return would be great timing, and after losing Nix, getting Dobbins back would provide a huge boost to the offense. It remains to be seen, however, if either player is ready to return to practice. The Super Bowl was initially mentioned as the best-case scenario for a potential Dobbins return target, but Payton (and Dobbins himself) have since hinted at a potential AFC title game return.

If the Broncos are going to activate Dobbins or Wattenberg (or both) from IR in time for the Patriots game, the first step would be a return to practice.

For Ben DiNucci, on Saturday, he was breaking down the situation involving the Broncos quarterback situation and the next day, he was a part of it.

The veteran quarterback was added to the Broncos’ practice squad in the wake of the season ending injury to Bo Nix, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported on Sunday.

DiNucci also appeared to confirm the news in a post on X.

“It has come to my attention that a team may be in need of my services…” DiNucci wrote on the social media platform. “Good thing my schedule is open this week. Broncos country… Let’s go get a Super Bowl?”

DiNucci, 29, has spent most of his professional career as a journeyman, spending time with a number of organizations since he was selected by the Cowboys in the seventh round of the 2020 NFL Draft.

He’s played for the Broncos, Bills, Saints, Falcons, and the XFL’s Seattle Sea Dragons and he was working as an analyst for CBS Sports HQ.

The Broncos are expected to use DiNucci as their third-string quarterback behind Jarrett Stidham, who has been thrust into the starting role, and Sam Ehlinger.

DiNucci is 0-1 as an NFL starter and completed 53.5 percent of his passes for 219 yards, while not throwing any touchdowns or interceptions.

During his time with the Sea Dragons in 2023, DiNucci threw for 2,671 yards and 20 touchdowns, both of which led the XFL.

In a funny turn of events, DiNucci deleted a post on social media that was critical of the controversial pass interference calls made on the Bills that helped the Broncos win on Saturday to advance to the AFC title game.

“Neither of those are even close to PI,” DiNucci wrote in the post that has since been deleted. “Can’t call those at that point in the game. Can’t reward a bad ball like that.”

Now, DiNucci will be a member of the Broncos again.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/newspress-collage-eytaytj68-1768799452767.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1768781482&w=1200,N,,2026-01-19 11:07:12.703669

Nix, in his second NFL season, has started every game of the 2024 and 2025 seasons. Saturday, he fractured a bone in his ankle on the second-to-last play of the game in overtime. Sunday will mark the first NFL game he misses.

Broncos kicker Wil Lutz sank a field goal at the end of the game to secure the Broncos' presence in the AFC Championship.

With Nix now out, and surgery scheduled for Tuesday, Stidham will take his place on Sunday and, should the Broncos win that game, in the Super Bowl on Feb. 8, too.

Nix is leaving big shoes to fill on Sunday, after a wildly successful season. Stidham, a former New England Patriot and Las Vegas Raider, is currently in his third year as a Bronco.

Broncos head coach Sean Payton said after Saturday's game that, ""he'll be ready to go and ready for the moment.""

""The plan has always got to be 'build around the type and skillset of the players you're playing with.' Are there certain things that Bo does differently than Stiddy? Absolutely. That's where the work begins tonight,"" Payton said.

The 29-year-old Kentucky native is 117-197 in his career with a 59.4% completion rate. He's thrown for 1,422 yards in the NFL with eight touchdowns and eight interceptions.

In his 2022 season with the Raiders, he showed what CBS Sports called ""on-the-move confidence"" after he took over as starting QB there in Weeks 17 and 18.

Stidham will become the first NFL quarterback to start in a conference championship without throwing a single pass during the regular season.

But history says backups can do it all. Most recently, Nick Foles led the Eagles to a World Championship, winning Super Bowl LII as Carson Wentz's backup.

Stidham started his college career at Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and then played at Auburn University in Alabama before going to the NFL draft.

In the NFL, he's played 20 total games and started two games with the Raiders in the 2022 season, losing both, and two games with the Broncos the following year, winning one.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2026/01/18/a72d8d3b-0d9d-4d78-a3ef-626b47460f51/thumbnail/1200x630/4f1c192ccdc559d68197265ba3608779/gettyimages-2255476111.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 13:00:55.161530

However, they Broncos also suffered a brutal loss during the contest. Starting quarterback Bo Nix suffered an injury that will sideline him for the remainder of Denver's playoff run.

Nix has started the last 36 games consecutively for the Broncos dating back to his rookie season. His absence will leave Denver leaning on its backup quarterback, who has played just 18 combined snaps over the last two seasons and hasn't thrown a pass since 2023.

Here's what to know about Nix's injury and when Broncos fans can expect him back on the field.

Is Bo Nix out for the season?

Yes, Nix is out for remainder of the NFL playoffs after fracturing his ankle in Denver's 33-30 win over Buffalo in the divisional round, as Broncos coach Sean Payton announced during his postgame news conference.

""On the second-to-last play in overtime, Bo fractured a bone in his right ankle,"" Payton told reporters. ""He's scheduled to have surgery Tuesday of this week to put him out for the rest of the season.""

Payton's announcement was a surprise, as Nix was able to finish the overtime period despite his injury. He completed 26 of 46 passes for 279 yards, three touchdowns and an interception while leading the Broncos with 12 carries and 29 rushing yards.

How did Bo Nix break his ankle?

Payton originally said Nix fractured his ankle on the second-to-last play of overtime. However, the 62-year-old coach later clarified the injury occurred on Nix's rushing attempt the play before Marvin Mims Jr. drew a critical, 30-yard pass interference call against Tre'Davious White.

On the play in question, the Broncos attempted a sweep play to the left with Nix. Bills safety Cole Bishop was able to get into the backfield untouched and brought the second-year quarterback down behind the line of scrimmage with an ankle tackle.

Nix was able to get up after the play but appeared slightly hobbled after the tackle. He remained in the game despite the injury, playing the Broncos' final two offensive snaps before Wil Lutz trotted out and made the game-winning, 23-yard field goal to send the Broncos to the AFC championship game.

Bo Nix injury video

Below is a full look at the play on which Nix was injured, per NFL Media's Tom Pelissero.

How long is Bo Nix out?

Nix is out for the remainder of the Broncos' season, but Denver hasn't yet provided a concrete timeline for his return to action.

ESPN reports Nix will ""likely"" be on track to play in Week 1 of the 2026 NFL regular season, provided all goes well with his recovery.

The Broncos may provide more information about Nix's recovery following his surgery, which Payton said was scheduled to take place in Alabama on Tuesday.

Who is Bo Nix's backup?

Jarrett Stidham is Nix's backup and will be called upon to start with the 25-year-old out of action.

Stidham, 29, is a seven-year veteran who was elected in the fourth round of the 2019 NFL Draft by the New England Patriots. He has a 1-3 career record as a starter and has completed 59.4% of his passes for 1,422 yards, eight touchdowns and eight interception across limited time with the Patriots, Las Vegas Raiders and Broncos.

Stidham last attempted a pass during the 2023 NFL season, when he went 1-1 across two starts with the Broncos and completed 60.6% of his passes for 496 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. Despite his lack of recent experience, Payton remains confident the veteran can fill in effectively for Nix.

""He's ready,"" Payton said of Stidham shortly after announcing Nix's injury. ""I said this at the beginning of the season, I feel like I've got a [No. 2 quarterback] that's capable of starting for a number of teams, and I know he feels the same way. So, watch out. Just watch. He's experienced, he's played in games.""

Broncos QB depth chart

The Broncos originally had just two healthy quarterbacks remaining in their organization after Nix's injury. They are set to ink a third to a practice-squad contract to ensure they have depth at the position as they look to make a Super Bowl run without their starting quarterback.

Below is a look at the pecking order within Denver's new-look quarterback room:

Jarrett Stidham

Sam Ehlinger

Ben DiNucci (practice squad)

Ehlinger is in his first season with the Broncos after spending his first four seasons with the Indianapolis Colts. The 27-year-old last attempted a pass in 2022, when he started three games, going 0-3 and completing 63.4% of his passes for 573 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions.

Meanwhile, DiNucci is reportedly joining Denver's practice squad after Nix's injury. The 29-year-old was a seventh-round pick of the Dallas Cowboys in the 2020 NFL Draft and made one start for the team that season while completing 53.5% of his passes for 212 yards across three appearances.

That said, they suffered multiple injuries along the way.

The most notable of the players to get shaken up might be Carlton Davis. The veteran cornerback, who helped set the tone with a pair of interceptions in the first half, was unable to finish the game because of a head injury.

Davis, 29, left the game in the fourth quarter. He first headed to the blue medical tent on the sideline and later made a trip into the Gillette Stadium bowels for further evaluation. The Patriots originally announced him as questionable to return before downgrading him to out with around two minutes remaining in the game.

New England’s fourth cornerback, Charles Woods, took over his role on defense.

Davis joined the Patriots on a three-year, $54 million free agency contract in March. Starting all 17 regular season contests as well as both postseason games so far, he is ranked second on the team with 1,041 combined defensive snaps. Along the way, he registered 76 tackles, 14 pass breakups and his two interceptions of Texans QB C.J. Stroud on Sunday.

Head coach Sean Payton detailed the moments after Nix's injury, which occurred on the third-to-last play of overtime. ""He gets hurt on the running play, then we call the stutter spears,"" said Payton. ""We get the big pass interference, the penalty. Then we center the ball, so he actually technically got hurt on his third-to-last play. He centers the ball for us, and then as he comes over, I kind of chest bump him, jab him like, ‘Freaking A!’ and he’s like, ‘Careful.’

""I’m like, ‘You all right?’ He said, ‘Yes, but it’s hurting.’ I said, ‘What do you got?’ He said, ‘My ankle.’ I said, ‘All right, you’ll be fine,’ and I jabbed him in the chest again. I said, ‘Just enjoy this field goal.’""

After the game-winning field goal, Nix did a postgame interview with CBS, then he immediately went into the X-ray room at Empower Field at Mile High, where the fracture was confirmed, according to ESPN's Sal Paolantonio.

""At that point, everyone’s in there in (the locker room) celebrating,"" Payton said during Sunday's conference call with reporters. ""Then I came and did the presser with you all. When I came back from that press conference, Beau [Lowery], our medical trainer, George [Paton], there was a group in my office and I knew. They didn’t say anything, but I knew there was something. We always meet after the game and discuss injuries but that was early. They said, ‘Look, there’s a fracture.’ [They] showed me the X-ray. Immediately, I walked down the hall. Bo was kind of sitting outside the locker room, leaning up against the wall. His wife, his parents, family there, I think ‘Stiddy’ (Jarrett Stidham), a few others. I just asked him how he was doing.""

After his initial postgame press conference, Payton learned of the significance of the injury and then returned to the podium to announce the news. He noted the QB's faith in response to the injury.

“I’ll tell you what, the one thing about it, he’s such a strong, faith-based guy,"" Payton said. ""He was sitting in the hallway with his family, and I went over, and we’re all talking to him. He knows that God has a plan for him.""

""He said he had one in high school, and then he said he had one at Auburn. I said, ‘I didn’t realize that.’ I said, ‘If I would have known that, I wouldn’t have drafted you,'"" Payton quipped. ""He’s a tough cookie. I said, ‘Listen. I believe you’re the second quarterback in Year 2 to take your team to a Championship game, and the first is [Patrick] Mahomes. This team all year has lost key players, and we’ll rise up for the next challenge and we’ll go from there.”

Jarrett Stidham is the next man up for the Broncos, and he will start the AFC Championship game next Sunday, against either the New England Patriots or the Houston Texans.

Nix was injured late in overtime of Denver’s playoff win over the Buffalo Bills, a victory that pushed the Broncos into the AFC Championship Game. The news came immediately after the game. Cameras during the game saw Nix moving gingerly after taking a knee to help the Broncos set up their game-winning field goal.

Key details

What happened: Bo Nix suffered an ankle injury late vs. Buffalo and will have surgery Tuesday, per Payton.

Who starts: Jarrett Stidham, 29, is expected to start; Sam Ehlinger will be the No. 2 QB.

What’s next: Denver is headed to the AFC Championship Game.

Five Fast Facts on Broncos QB Jarrett Stidham: Stats, NFL Draft Position, College

1) The Broncos have already made it official: Stidham is the next starter. Payton said Stidham will start with Nix sidelined for the rest of the season, and NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported Sam Ehlinger will back him up. That’s a major pivot for Denver, and it’s coming with the season’s biggest stage next.

2) Stidham isn’t a random emergency option; Denver invested in him. The Broncos re-signed Stidham to a two-year deal in 2025, a move widely viewed as keeping a trusted No. 2 quarterback in Payton’s system behind Nix. In other words: the Broncos planned for this possibility, even if they never wanted to use it.

3) He has real-game reps, including one big-time “I can do this” start. Stidham’s most memorable extended action came with the Raiders, when he threw for 365 yards and three touchdowns in his first NFL start, nearly knocking off the 49ers. Over his career, he’s logged regular-season action with New England, Las Vegas and Denver, with his overall stat line sitting around 1,400+ passing yards and an even TD-to-INT split, per NFL.com’s career totals.

4) He entered the league as a mid-round “developmental” QB, and the Patriots drafted him as a Brady understudy. Stidham was picked by the New England Patriots in the fourth round (No. 133 overall) of the 2019 NFL Draft, a selection widely framed at the time as adding a long-term quarterback project behind Tom Brady. Predraft/early scouting on him generally emphasized NFL-caliber arm talent and play-action/rollout ability, with the “project” label tied to consistency and development needs, the type of profile teams take on Day 3 hoping coaching and time sharpen the decision-making.

5) In college, Stidham was a legit SEC quarterback, and earned conference honors. Stidham played two seasons at Auburn (2017-18) and helped lead the Tigers to the 2017 SEC Championship Game. He was also named second-team All-SEC in 2017 after throwing for 3,158 yards with 18 TDs and six INTs, per the Broncos’ bio.

""It has come to my attention that a team may be in need of my services… Good thing my schedule is open this week,"" DiNucci wrote. ""Broncos country… Let’s go get a Super Bowl ?""

In the social media post, DiNucci included an image of himself when he was with the Broncos in 2023. But he hasn't played a regular-season snap since he was a rookie with the Dallas Cowboys in 2020. He also hasn't been on a roster since the Atlanta Falcons waived him during preliminary training camp cuts in August.

In fact, DiNucci was actually analyzing the impact of Nix's season-ending ankle injury for the Broncos in a broadcast for CBS Sports on Saturday. DiNucci, 29, has also spent time in training camp or on a practice squad with the Buffalo Bills and New Orleans Saints since his last NFL start. On top of that, DiNucci spent a season with the Seattle Sea Dragons in the XFL.

Broncos head coach Sean Payton has iterated that Stidham will be under center for next Sunday's game against the New England Patriots. It'll mark Stidham's first start since 2023. Sam Ehlinger is also slated to be Stidham's primary backup after getting called up from the practice squad earlier in January.

In terms of what other options the Broncos could turn to at quarterback for the remainder of the playoffs, the list is slim. They can't sign any quarterback who finished their season on an active roster. So, Philip Rivers won't be able to make another legendary comeback, for instance. They also can't add a quarterback who's on an opposing team's reserve/retired list, like Derek Carr. Carr is on the Saints' reserve/retired list after announcing his retirement in March.

The only quarterbacks the Broncos can sign are players who ended the 2025 NFL regular season as a free agent. Drew Brees, for instance, could sign with the Broncos and reunite with his former Saints coach as no NFL team holds his contract rights.

But Payton has expressed confidence in Stidham ahead of the backup quarterback's first playoff start.

""There’d be practices where I’m looking at [defensive coordinator] Vance [Joseph] and getting (mad) because Stiddy’s making our defense look bad,"" Payton told reporters. ""He’s very accurate. He’s got a lot to his ball.""

Stidham will actually go up against a Patriots team that selected him in the fourth round of the 2019 NFL Draft. Payton said that he had his eyes on potentially drafting Stidham when he was still with the Saints.

""I know exactly how he was coached in New England, and then I know how [Patriots offensive coordinator Josh] McDaniels felt about him when he brought him from New England to Vegas. And then I know reports on how he played and then we saw him play in real time,"" Payton said.

""But ultimately ... it’s our three years here and our three years watching him day in and day out ... And so he will be ready to go and ready for the moment.""

The path to the Super Bowl is now clear. In this magical season where nearly everything has broken their way, the Patriots just need to beat a backup quarterback who hasn’t thrown an NFL pass in two years, and they’ll be off to Santa Clara, Calif., for Super Bowl LX.

They’ll head to Denver next weekend to visit Jarrett Stidham and the Broncos, after Bo Nix suffered a broken ankle late in the team’s win Saturday. Stidham, of course, was drafted by the Patriots in the fourth round of the 2019 draft. But his time with the franchise lasted just three years.

No, a trip to Denver won’t be easy, considering the weapons the Broncos have, particularly on defense. But it’s hard to imagine a more favorable path to the Super Bowl.

It’s hard to criticize the Texans defense too much, considering the multiple times that they bailed out the offense, managing to hold the Patriots scoreless on their four possessions following turnovers.

However, the Houston unit, which entered the fourth quarter having held the Patriots to a 1-for-10 showing on third downs, wore down in the fourth quarter. The Texans gave up a six-play, 71-yard scoring drive, capped by Drake Maye’s pass to Kayshon Boutte. Then they allowed the Patriots to chew up over six minutes of clock on a subsequent fourth-quarter possession.

Generally, if your defense records three takeaways and dominates on third downs, you should get a win. But not on Sunday.

For the second straight game, Drake Maye didn’t have his best stuff but was good enough to help deliver a win. The MVP candidate came back from a so-so performance against the Chargers and continued to have issues holding onto the ball behind a struggling offensive line. His four fumbles helped keep the Texans in the game — and could have been worse if rookie tackle Will Campbell hadn’t recovered two of them.

To be fair, Maye was quite good when he had time to throw, but he struggled with holding onto the ball too long as Houston’s defensive line dominated the New England front five. His 32-yard touchdown pass to Kayshon Boutte in the fourth quarter helped seal the game and was perfectly thrown.

The Patriots might not need Maye’s A-game next week either, considering the backup quarterback they’ll be facing in Denver. But they’d surely like to get Maye back to playing like an MVP, even if they haven’t needed that level of play in the first two rounds of the playoffs.

C.J. Stroud closed out the regular season in position for a lucrative payday. But now, the quarterback will face great scrutiny after a playoff fizzle that saw him underperform against Pittsburgh and then cost his team with a woeful performance against New England. Sunday’s game was a chance for Houston to advance past the divisional round for the first time in franchise history.

Now, the Texans must decide how to handle his future. Can they really give him a hefty contract in the neighborhood of $250 million to $300 million per season? Or, should they just pick up the fifth-year option on his rookie deal and see how he plays in 2026 to buy them more time before making such an investment?

Either way, the Texans have to further improve their offensive line because it’s clear that Stroud’s confidence in that unit is weak. Stroud, meanwhile, must work to improve his poise and decision-making skills while also learning how to better extend plays.

The Patriots defense was solid during the regular season. It wasn’t bad, but it was certainly the weaker side of the ball as the team’s offense dominated throughout. But in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the New England defense is playing like one of the best units in the NFL.

After holding Justin Herbert and the Chargers to three points in last weekend’s wild-card round, the Patriots notched a pick six Sunday, intercepted C.J. Stroud four times and scooped up a fumble to put the final tally at five turnovers.

Most importantly, they had Stroud in a blender throughout. Defensive play caller Zak Kuhr dialed up another impressive game plan and put together a package of blitzes that had the Houston quarterback looking flummoxed from the get-go.

Houston managed just 3.3 yards per play and was unable to get anything going on the ground.

The Patriots defense seems to be peaking at the right time and is absolutely rolling heading into the AFC Championship Game.

The biggest question for Houston entering this game was whether C.J. Stroud could cure the uncharacteristic ills that plagued him in the wild-card round against Pittsburgh. And the third-year quarterback saw his fumble woes from that game morph into an interception ailment against New England.

His four interceptions killed possession after possession, and although the defense managed to keep Houston within striking distance, Stroud’s inability to execute cost his team the game.

Clearly, the Texans’ offensive game plan was to throw Christian Gonzalez’s way often — especially after fellow Patriots cornerback Carlton Davis came down with two first-half interceptions. It didn’t work, as Gonzalez only allowed 7 receptions and 58 receiving yards on 16 coverage targets, per NFL Next Gen Stats. That’s just 16 yards per target.

As a whole, the Patriots defense forced 14 tight windows on C.J. Stroud’s 47 pass attempts, a rate of nearly 30 percent. That’s the highest rate by a defense over the last six postseason.

In other words, while Stroud bears a lot of blame for his four first-half interceptions, New England also made it exceptionally hard on him.

This marks the third time the Patriots and Broncos have met in the AFC Championship Game. The other two games took place in Denver as well, after the 2013 and 2015 seasons. The Broncos won both of those.

The quarterbacks who started each of those games were Peyton Manning for the Broncos and Tom Brady for the Patriots, respectively.

With Nico Collins out with a concussion and Dalton Schultz suffering a calf injury in the first half, even more responsibility was placed on rookie Jayden Higgins, putting together a solid showing.

He was targeted 10 times, catching six passes for 59 yards, closing his first season in the NFL with promising performance. Higgins will likely be a substantial part of Houston's offense moving forward and this playoff run was a valuable experience for him.

After the best game of his young career last week in Pittsburgh, Woody Marks was completely shut down today in New England. The rookie received 14 carries and only rushed for 17 yards, averaging 1.2 yards per carry.

While he outperformed his draft slot this season, he likely did not prove enough this year to warrant being Houston's certain starter at running back moving forward, though he has earned a role in this offense in some capacity.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/eVkllHZYZSjJ_emcM2tJiPT3S_1440x960.jpg",N,,2026-01-19 02:58:49.316032

Coach Sean Payton delivered the stunning news about his second-year quarterback in the aftermath of Denver’s biggest win in a decade. Backup Jarrett Stidham, who is 1-3 as a starter in six seasons, will start the AFC championship game next weekend.

“Stiddy’s ready,” Payton said after returning to the postgame lectern to discuss the injury following Denver’s 33-30 victory over Josh Allen and the Bills.

Payton said Nix got hurt on a keeper where he lost 2 yards and was tackled by safety Cole Bishop. Nix was limping after the play, but there was no indication that he suffered such a serious injury.

On the next play, Nix threw a deep pass to Marvin Mims Jr. that drew a 30-yard pass-interference flag and got the Broncos well into field-goal range. Nix then took a knee to center the ball for Wil Lutz’s game-ending 23-yard field goal.

Payton said Nix will have surgery Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama.

“He’s such a strong, faith-based guy,” Payton said. “He’s sitting in the hallway with his family and coming over and we’re all talking to him. He knows that God’s got a plan for him and he said he had (a broken ankle) in high school and then he said he had one at Auburn.

“And I said I didn’t realize that. I said if I had known that I wouldn’t have drafted you,” Payton cracked.

Nix said nothing about being hurt during a postgame interview with CBS, and he sounded like he was looking forward to the next game.

“It’s great to have home-field advantage in a situation like this. It’s exciting. This is why you play the game, this is why you compete. You get to playoff football, and good things happen,” Nix said.

The locker room had cleared out and reporters were waiting in an interview room for Nix when Payton returned and delivered the news.

Nix, the 12th overall pick out of Oregon in the 2024 NFL draft, tied Russell Wilson’s NFL record with two dozen victories in his first two seasons. Saturday’s victory was his first in the playoffs. The Broncos lost last year at Buffalo, but Nix led Denver to the AFC’s top seed this season.

“He’s a tough cookie,” Payton said. “And this team all year has lost key players and will rise up for the next challenge.”

DENVER — As Bo Nix’s teammates talked about their quarterback’s late-game heroics inside a euphoric locker room Saturday night, imagining what he’d do for an encore next week with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line, few realized that Nix was in another room nearby, being consoled by family as the gravity of the news settled over him.

An hour after the Broncos outlasted the Buffalo Bills 33-30 in an overtime thriller in the divisional round of the AFC playoffs, head coach Sean Payton walked into the press conference room at Empower Field for the second time. His first visit to the podium was used to dissect Denver’s first playoff win in a decade, a stunning victory fueled by five defensive takeaways and clutch plays by his quarterback that launched the Broncos into next week’s AFC Championship Game. The second visit, after Payton had changed out of his team-issued sweats and into a green hoodie and tan jacket, was used to break the devastating news that Nix wouldn’t be playing in that game.

“Not good news,” Payton said. “On the second-to-last play in overtime, Bo fractured a bone in his right ankle. He’s scheduled to have surgery Tuesday of this (upcoming) week, which will put him out for the rest of the season. (Backup Jarrett Stidham) is ready to go.”

The play was technically the fourth-to-last play of overtime, as Payton wasn’t accounting for Wil Lutz’s walk-off field goal or the Nix kneeldown that preceded it. The injury occurred on a first-and-10 play from the Buffalo 36-yard line as Nix took a shotgun snap and then followed blockers on a run to the left side. He was tackled by safety Cole Bishop for a 2-yard loss and got up with a slight limp. When he kneeled the ball two plays later, following a Buffalo pass-interference penalty that moved Denver into chip-shot range, Nix momentarily struggled to get to his feet and then walked with a more noticeable limp off the field. He hugged backup quarterback Sam Ehlinger as the kick went through and then limped toward a postgame interview with CBS reporter Tracy Wolfson.

“We found a way to win again,” Nix said. “Our defense made stops and I’m just proud of our guys. I’m proud of this organization and the way we compete and the way we fight. We’re just never out of it. I think that’s just a character piece.”

Nix, who added a game-winning drive Saturday to the league-high seven he piloted during the regular season, has embodied the fight that earned the Broncos a spot in the AFC Championship Game, which will be right back here next week against the New England Patriots or Houston Texans. After Saturday’s game, tight end Adam Trautman marveled at the way Nix remains cool in some of the late-game moments that send everybody else’s hearts racing.

“You don’t ever look at him and go, ‘Oh my god, why is he nervous?'” Trautman said. “That doesn’t exist. He’s probably more fired up than he usually is at the end of games. It gives you confidence and it’s been that way all year.”

Trautman and the rest of his teammates would find out minutes later that they would not have Nix at their side as they try to finish off this special season with a trip to the Super Bowl. They will now turn to Stidham, the seventh-year veteran who has backed up Nix for the past two seasons. Payton’s preference would have been to tell the team in a morning meeting, but he said it would be “impossible” for the news of Nix’s injury not to get out before then. So he spoke to them, “in essence,” from that podium. The 62-year-old coach was clearly pained by what Nix, who will miss his first game since joining the Broncos, was grappling with in the moment. Still, Payton was defiant about what it means for his team.

“This team all year has lost key players,” Payton said. “We’ll rise up for the next challenge, and we’ll go from there.”

The whiplash that came Saturday night — the euphoria of a come-from-behind, overtime victory in front of a frenzied home crowd, followed by the somber reality that the Broncos had lost their quarterback — in many ways mirrored the game that extended Denver’s season. The scores was tied at 10 with less than 30 seconds left in the second quarter. Then, Nix hit Lil’Jordan Humphrey for a 29-yard touchdown. On Buffalo’s next play, which came with only 16 seconds left, Nik Bonitto forced a Josh Allen fumble and Devon Key recovered for the Broncos at the Bills’ 33-yard line, setting up a 51-yard field goal for Wil Lutz.

“There’s a fast 10 (points) before you get out of your seat at halftime,” Payton said. “That probably was the difference in the game, but really, that happened quick.”

Bonitto forced another Allen fumble on the second play of the third quarter on a strip-sack. Malcolm Roach recovered and Denver followed with another field goal.

All of a sudden, the Broncos had a 23-10 lead. It didn’t last long.

The Bills ripped off 17 straight points behind running back James Cook (117 rushing yards) and timely conversions from Allen. Then came Nix’s go-ahead drive late in the fourth quarter. He hit Courtland Sutton on the sideline to get things moving, then found Sutton again for 25 yards on third-and-11. He scrambled for a first down, then hit Marvin Mims for a 26-yard touchdown that gave the Broncos the lead with only 61 seconds left in the game. Nix did it all despite operating without wide receivers Pat Bryant and Troy Franklin, both of whom were knocked out of the game with injuries in the first quarter.

“I did a lot of stuff I hadn’t done all year,” said Mims, who was taken off kick return duty after the two receivers went down with injuries. “You practice it a little bit in practice, but most of the time it’s those other guys getting those reps. It’s just, especially mentally, being ready. Physically, you know what you have to do on that play. This year hasn’t been what I thought it would be at all, but when you get your opportunity, you have to make the most of it. As an NFL player, as anybody in life, you can’t just pout about it. When your moment comes, you have to be ready for it. Bo trusted me to go out and make plays.”

Allen still had three timeouts and led the Bills into range for a Matt Prater field goal that sent the game into overtime. After the Broncos’ opening drive of the extra period stalled, Jeremy Crawshaw’s “punt of the year,” as Payton put it, pinned Buffalo at its own 7-yard line. Allen escaped pressure in the end zone — Payton said holding should have been called for a walk-off safety — to find Dalton Kincaid and pick up a first down, then hit Ray Davis for another. The Broncos then pushed Buffalo to third-and-11 at their own 36-yard line and Allen tried to win the game with one, big deep ball. He skied the ball up the right seam for Brandin Cooks, who had a step on nickel Ja’Quan McMillian. At the last second, McMillian reached for the ball just as Cooks was grabbing it himself. As the Buffalo receiver hit the ground, the ball was in his hands, but McMillian ripped it away as he rolled off of Cooks.

“I just fought through the hands and made the play,” said McMillian, who scored Denver’s lone touchdown on a pick six in a Week 18 win against the Chargers that clinched the Broncos’ first-round bye. “He actually came down with it, but since I had my hands on the ball, I was able to take it from him. I just held the ball up and showed the fans some love.”

“It was an amazing play by J-Mac,” Payton said.

Bills coach Sean McDermott said afterward, “It is hard for me to understand why it was ruled how it was ruled.” He lamented that there wasn’t a more extensive challenge that slowed the play down “to make sure we have this thing right.”

“The receiver has to complete the process of a catch,” referee Carl Cheffers said in a pool report. “He was going to the ground as part of the process of the catch and he lost possession of the ball when he hit the ground. The defender gained possession of it at that point. The defender is the one that completed the process of the catch, so the defender was awarded the ball.”

Trautman had been sitting on the bench and stared up at the Jumbotron as Allen launched the ball to Cooks.

“All you see when you watch the scoreboard is the ball in the air,” the tight end said. “You’re like, ‘Ah, s—, ah, s—,’ as you see Brandin Cooks touch it. And you’re like, ‘Ah, s—.’ Then, you see J-Mac come up with it and you’re like, ‘Was that a pick?! Did he just pick that?’ Then, it’s, ‘All right, let’s go score.'”

Nix marched the Broncos into scoring territory from there, drawing two pass-interference penalties on deep balls for Humphrey and Mims. After his interview with Wolfson, Nix walked toward the tunnel, raising his arms at the Broncos’ crowd, a giant smile on his face.

The Broncos want that to be the enduring image of their quarterback as they try to complete this march toward a championship without him.

“We celebrate the season,” Payton said, “for him.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2026/01/18001528/GettyImages-2256821632-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2026-01-19 02:00:15.557581

The Broncos quarterback is now in line to start in the AFC Championship next Sunday after starter Bo Nix suffered a fracture in his right ankle during Denver's overtime win against the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round. Nix's injury will require surgery and sideline him for the rest of the season, meaning it'll be up to Stidham to help Denver advance to Super Bowl LX and possibly hoist its first Lombardi Trophy in a decade.

That's a mighty tall order for the 29-year-old, who has just four career starts under his belt. Stidham's last regular-season pass in the NFL came all the way back in Week 18 of the 2023 campaign. Now, he'll be entrusted with a team that earned the No. 1 seed in the conference and boasts one of the top defenses in the league. However, that won't mean anything if Stidham can't answer the bell, but there does appear to be internal confidence in the veteran quarterback.

Six wild QB options for Broncos after shocking Bo Nix injury: Tom Brady can't play, but two other MVPs could

John Breech

""I would say this, in fairness to what you've seen, which is very limited: He's ready,"" head coach Sean Payton told reporters of Stidham, via the official team website. ""He's ready. I said this at the beginning of the season, I feel like I've got a [No. 2 quarterback] that's capable of starting for a number of teams, and I know he feels the same way. Watch out. Just watch. He's experienced, he's played in games. They're different type players to some degree.""

As Payton references, we've had a limited view of Stidham throughout his career and tenure with the Broncos, so let's get familiar with the signal caller who is set to lead Denver into the AFC Championship.

⭐️ Five-star recruit entering college

Stidham was a highly regarded prospect coming out of high school (Stephenville, Texas), with 247Sports ranking him as a five-star recruit and the No. 1-ranked dual-threat quarterback in 2015 -- ahead of Kyler Murray (No. 2), Sam Darnold (No. 6), Joe Burrow (No. 7), and Lamar Jackson (No. 9).

Stidham was an early Texas Tech commit, but decommitted from the Red Raiders following Patrick Mahomes' freshman season in Lubbock, in which it was clear Mahomes would be a start QB for then-coach Kliff Kinsburgy. Stidham flipped his commitment to Baylor, which had emerged as as Texas powerhouse during the early part of the decade, and got his feet fet. After beginning the year as the backup, an injury atop the depth chart saw Stidham ascend as the Bears' starter. In his first start against Kansas State, he tossed for 419 yards and had four total touchdowns.

After the dismissal of head coach Art Briles, Stidham transferred to McClellan Junior College, where he sat out the season and maintained eligibility, then transferred to Auburn. where he went on to be named second-team All-SEC in 2017. That year, he led the Tigers to wins against No. 1-ranked Georgia and No. 1-ranked Alabama. Stidham's second season at Auburn was not as productive as the first, and he decided to forgo his final year of eligibility to declare for the 2019 NFL Draft.

Drafted by Patriots, eyed as potential Tom Brady successor

With the 133rd overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, New England selected Stidham, who then found himself as the No. 2 on the depth chart behind Tom Brady.

His first taste of NFL action was a forgettable experience, however. In Week 3, he came in for Brady in the fourth quarter of a blowout win over the New York Jets. After coming in, Stidham threw a pick-6 to Jamal Adams, which led to Brady coming back into the contest to finish the game.

That was the most action Stidham saw over his rookie season. His sophomore campaign, however, did provide some intrigue, particularly in the aftermath of Brady leaving the Patriots after the 2019 season for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Stidham was looked at as a possible in-house option to succeed Brady, as New England did not add a clear-cut option at quarterback in the early stages of free agency (outside of a reunion with veteran Brian Hoyer) or at the 2020 NFL Draft. While it momentarily appeared Stidham could be an option for the Patriots as the franchise began the post-Brady era, those plans changed later that summer when the club signed Cam Newton. The former NFL MVP won the starting job, and Stidham lost out on the second-string job to Hoyer, demoting him to QB3.

Stidham came in at various points throughout the year, including a Week 4 matchup with the Chiefs after Newton was sidelined due to COVID-19 protocol, and Hoyer struggled during the contest. He threw his first career touchdown in the losing effort, but also had two interceptions.

Despite New England's struggles throughout the year, Bill Belichick never gave Stidham a look as a starter.

The following year, the Patriots drafted Mac Jones, and Hoyer remained as the backup, with Stidham not seeing the field at all during the 2021 season.

Pats trade Stidham to Las Vegas

New England ended up trading Stidham to the Las Vegas Raiders in May of 2022 in what was essentially a swap of Day 3 draft picks in 2023. That deal saw Stidham reunite with Josh McDaniels, who was hired as the Raiders head coach that offseason after serving as the Patriots offensive coordinator when he entered the league. Stidham began the year as a backup to Derek Carr, but he did get a look as the club's starter at the end of the season, starting both Week 17 and Week 18 for Las Vegas.

The club went 0-2, but Stidham's numbers weren't terrible, completing 64.3% of his passes, tossing four touchdowns and three interceptions, registering a 91.6 passer rating, and averaging 292 yards through the air.

Joins Broncos, starts after Russell Wilson benching

In 2023, Stidham signed a two-year, $10 million deal with the Broncos, who had just acquired head coach Sean Payton in a trade with the New Orleans Saints. In a similar situation to the one he found himself in the year prior with the Raiders, Stidham became Denver's starter at the end of the season after the Broncos benched Russell Wilson. Stidham went 1-1 over those starts in Week 17 and Week 18 of the 2023 campaign, and again put up serviceable numbers. He completed 60.6% of his passes, averaged 248 passing yards per game, had two touchdowns and one interception, and registered an 87.7 passer rating.

That Week 18 game against the Raiders was the last time Stidham had thrown a meaningful pass in the NFL, until he drops back next Sunday in the AFC Championship. In that game specifically, he was 20 of 34 for 272 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. He was also sacked five times in that contest.

Is Stidham capable of leading Denver to Super Bowl LX?

In a season as upside-down as the 2025 campaign, where quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow, and Lamar Jackson were nowhere to be found this postseason, and a 44-year-old Philip Rivers came out of retirement to join the Colts, anything's possible, right? That said, this does feel like almost too big a hurdle to overcome for Stidham and the Broncos.

Before we highlight how things could go wrong, however, let's bullet some key factors that do fall in Denver's favor as they prepare for Stidham to start in the AFC Championship.

The AFC Championship is at home at Mile High. Stidham won't have to add playing in a road environment to his plate. Meanwhile, their opponent will have the elevation as another adversary, and that did seem to impact the Bills.

Stidham is familiar with the system. Stidham has been with the Broncos since 2023, which should make him well-versed in what Sean Payton asks of quarterbacks, albeit without a ton of starting experience.

Stidham has started before. As we noted, Stidham doesn't have a lot of starting experience (four starts), but it's not zero, and that includes two starts with Payton's Broncos. He's not a rookie coming into this game 100% cold, which has to count for something. Stidham has also flashed a bit when given those opportunities.

Broncos OL has protected well. During the regular season with Nix under center, the Broncos' offensive line allowed just 23 sacks, which was tied for the fewest in the NFL. Their 32.6% pressure rate allowed was also the fifth-lowest in the league, so Stidham should have some time to throw the football.

Denver's defense, in theory, could carry Stidham. In an ideal world, the Broncos take a page out of the Seahawks' book from their divisional round win over the 49ers. In that win, they didn't ask Sam Darnold (who was dealing with an oblique injury) to do much, and attempted just 17 passes in the win. Denver would love a game script where the defense -- which ranked top three in points per game (18.3), yards per game (278.2), and third down percentage (33.8%) this season -- controls the game, and only needs Stidham to make a couple of necessary throws.

Okay, that's the glass-half-full side of the equation. The other -- possibly more realistic -- side of things paints a grim picture. First off, turnovers could prove to be a problem for Stidham in the AFC Championship. He's tossed at least one interception in all but one of his four starts, and his teams are 1-3 in those contests.

While there have already been some parallels drawn to Nick Foles leading the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl LII title after Carson Wentz got hurt in 2017 by those trying to hold onto a sliver of hope, it's hard to make that connection. Foles had 36 starts before joining the Eagles during that 2017 season, which included a Pro Bowl campaign in 2013. Stidham doesn't have anywhere near that same pedigree.

Stidham will be the seventh quarterback to make his first career start of the season in the playoffs. Frank Reich is the only one of the prior six to lead his team to a win. He's also the first quarterback to make his first start in the conference championship since Roger Staubach in 1972.

Late in the third quarter of a 41-6 drubbing against the NFC West rival Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round, star running back Christian McCaffrey wound up in the injury tent with a stinger while starting tight end Jake Tonges, who only entered the lineup because George Kittle tore his right Achilles last week, followed soon after.

Seahawks win |Instant Reaction| Box Score

As San Francisco limped to a finish, so, too, did its roster.

“When you’re playing with guys you’re signing off the practice squad,” left tackle Trent Williams said, “guys (you are) taking off the street — you got to temper expectations a bit.”

San Francisco had won six in a row before losing to Seattle 13-3 in the regular-season finale, and churned out those victories without injured All-Pros like linebacker Fred Warner and defensive end Nick Bosa.

“So many rosters were fully loaded while we were playing with guys that we got a week ago, two weeks ago, some guys signed at the beginning of the season, some guys signed in the middle of the season,” Williams said. “The fact that we were able to get to this part of the season, divisional round in the playoffs and give ourselves a chance to get in the NFC Championship and we’re extremely shorthanded, I’m proud of this team.”

The 49ers ran into a Seahawks team that continued to improve as the season progressed, and outscored the 49ers 54-9 in the last two games.

Seattle limited quarterback Brock Purdy and San Francisco to just two field goals in the 49ers’ second-most lopsided playoff loss in franchise history. San Francisco lost 49-3 to the New York Giants in the divisional round in the 1986 season.

Purdy had to run for his life all evening, and completed 15 of 27 passes for 140 yards with an interception and a fumble.

“It’s no secret in terms of their style of play,” Purdy said about Seattle’s defense. “It’s try to make the quarterback check it down and play deep to short. And then within that, have a good pass rush. And that’s a good defense, man. Like, it’s a smart way to play.”

Much of the season, the 49ers held serve with NFC West foes like the Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams, both of whom are still alive in the playoffs. They split their season series with each opponent.

Should the Rams beat the Chicago Bears on Sunday, though, it would be another NFC West showdown in Seattle for a spot in the Super Bowl.

But as the 49ers quite literally hobbled to the end of the 2025 season, it also spurred some contemplation from its top players about how to properly reflect on the 49ers’ season. McCaffrey, who did briefly return after his injury, called it an “emotional roller-coaster” to go through the season.

“What I will say is this is, in all my years playing, the proudest I’ve ever been to be a part of a team,” McCaffrey said. “It’s this team; I love everybody in that locker room.”

Broncos coach Sean Payton announced postgame that Nix sustained the injury only three plays before Denver kicked a game-winning field goal. Jarrett Stidham will start for Denver, the top seed in the AFC, in the conference championship game next Sunday.

The shocking news came after Nix became the first QB not named Patrick Mahomes or Joe Burrow to defeat Josh Allen in the postseason this decade.

The Broncos won after a back-and-forth battle in the fourth quarter and overtime.

After two scoreless drives to open the extra period, Nix led Denver on a 75-yard jaunt for the game-winning score, aided by two pass interference penalties on the Bills. Allen forced overtime by getting Buffalo into field-goal position in the final minute of regulation, but he threw an interception in OT that set up the Broncos’ winning field goal — his fourth turnover of the day.

“It’s extremely difficult. I feel like I let my teammates down tonight,” Allen, wiping away tears, said postgame.

He added: “It’s been a long season. Hate how it ended. It’s gonna stick with me for a long time.”

For Nix, Saturday’s win was a statement effort in what was only his second career postseason start.

A year after he threw for only 144 yards in a 31-7 loss to the Bills in the wild-card round, Nix threw for 279 yards and three scores in a victory.

His most impressive drive came in the fourth quarter. Trailing 27-23, Nix spearheaded an eight-play, 73-yard drive capped by a 26-yard touchdown pass to give Denver a 30-27 lead with under a minute to go.

Nix also came through in the final period, as his willingness to throw the ball deep led to two defensive pass interference penalties on Buffalo — one for 17 yards and another for 30 that put the Broncos inside the 10-yard line.

“He was fantastic when we needed him,” Payton said afterward.

For Allen, the loss was the latest in a string of devastating defeats for a franchise that has become synonymous with postseason heartbreak. After it lost four straight Super Bowls in the 1990s, Buffalo has now failed to make it back to the championship round for the seventh straight season of Allen’s tenure.

Including Saturday’s, four of the Bills’ last five playoff losses have come in one-score games, including two in overtime. The combined margin of defeat in those four losses is only 15 points.

Allen’s performance was boom or bust, as every Buffalo drive ended in either a score or a turnover. He finished the game 25 of 39 for 283 yards and three touchdowns, running 12 times for 66 more yards. But he also threw two interceptions and lost two fumbles. The four turnovers came at especially inopportune moments, including an ill-advised cough-up right before halftime that handed Denver three points.

“Just trying to be aggressive; can’t do that,” Allen said of the play.

Allen’s final interception came in overtime, when a Bills field goal would have ended the game.

Leading into this postseason, Allen’s playoff defeats had come largely at the hands of some of the conference’s best quarterbacks. But with Mahomes, Burrow and two-time MVP Lamar Jackson all absent from the playoff field, Buffalo appeared to have its most favorable path to its first Super Bowl appearance since the 1993 season.

Instead, Allen — who had gone six straight postseason games without a turnover — gave the ball away four times and was ultimately outdueled by Nix.

“Can’t win with five turnovers,” Allen said. “I fumbled twice, threw two picks. When you shoot yourself in the foot like that, you don’t deserve to win football games.”

Said Payton: “We obviously weren’t ready last year, but we were ready today.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260117-bo-nix-AP26018061460464-b579ae.jpg",N,,2026-01-18 23:59:19.059398

The NFL is an unforgiving profession. Big thanks to Bo Nix for leading the Broncos to the AFC Championship Game, but this is Jarrett Stidham’s team now. Heal up that ankle, Nix. See ya next year.

With the Super Bowl at stake, what choice does a team have but to move on?

“We have enough information for everyone and the focus is on the next week’s game,’’ Broncos head coach Sean Payton said a Zoom media call on Sunday.

Nix led the Broncos to a 33-30 overtime AFC Divisional Round victory against Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills on a chilly Saturday afternoon before a sold out, bundled up crowd of 76,000 at Empower Field at Mile High. But on the fourth-to-last play, Nix suffered a fractured right ankle while trying to plant away from Bills safety Cole Bishop, who tackled the quarterback’s left ankle for a 2-yard loss.

Nix will have surgery on Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama, while Stidham will game plan with Payton, offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and quarterbacks coach Davis Webb against either New England or Houston for the AFC Championship Game that will be played next Sunday afternoon at Empower Field.

Payton has confidence Stidham can lead the Broncos to victory next week. Why?

“It started with our evaluations in New Orleans,’’ Payton said, referring to the 2019 NFL Draft when Stidham became a fourth-round pick of the Bill Belichick-coach New England Patriots, whose offensive coordinator at the time was former Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels. “He was a target for us in the draft. That doesn’t really mean anything other than we liked this player coming out.

“I know how he was coached in New England. And then I know how [Josh] McDaniels felt about him when he brought him from New England to Vegas. And then we had reports on how he played and then we saw him play real time.

“But ultimately it’s our three years here and our three years watching him day-in and day-out that you guys don’t have access to. And so he’ll be ready to go and ready for the moment.”

The media and fans did have access to how Stidham played in the preseason. Stidham led all NFL preseason quarterbacks with a 143.0 passer rating that was computed off completing 30 of 38 passes for 376 yards and 4 touchdowns without an interception from games against San Francisco and Arizona.

But that’s the last time anyone saw Stidham play. How ready is he following a season of practices? Generally speaking, Nix would take almost all the reps during team periods with Stidham playing scout team quarterback against Vance Joseph’s defense.

“Stidy would take some [first-team] reps, especially during the bye week before the playoffs began,’’ Payton said. “But I would say it would be rare around the league in a 10-rep period for a coach to have 7 and 3 [reps for the starting QB and No. 2 QB]. And then the next team period, 12 plays, to be 8 and 4. That’s mythical. That just doesn’t happen.

“Generally in work week, the reps are limited and the starter wants them. But one of Stidy’s great strengths is his mental aptitude and his progressions and understanding plays. There’d be practices where I’m looking at Vance and getting [ticked] off because Stidy’s making our defense look bad. He’s very accurate. He’s got a lot to his ball.”",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/b516f074-e00f-45bd-80ca-9bb5385e3cc7/20260118T194949/b516f074-e00f-45bd-80ca-9bb5385e3cc7_1140x641.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 02:00:23.762497

Stidham will start the AFC Championship Game next Sunday for the Broncos against the New England Patriots, and Payton was quick to say the 29-year-old quarterback is ready for his first postseason moment.

""I know how he was coached in New England. I know exactly how he was coached in New England,"" Payton said. ""And then I know how [current Patriots OC Josh] McDaniels felt about him ... but ultimately ... it's our three years here, our three years watching him day in and day out. He will be ready to go.""

Stidham was signed by the Broncos as a free agent in 2023, Payton's first season in Denver. The veteran has appeared in one game this season with four snaps, including a kneel-down to end the Broncos' 44-24 win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 8.

Stidham appeared in three games in the 2024 season, Nix's rookie year, but did not attempt a pass. His last significant playing time came in 2023 when he started the final two games of the season after Payton had benched Russell Wilson. Stidham threw two touchdowns and an interception in those two games, including a 16-9 win over the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 17.

Sam Ehlinger, who has spent most of this season on the Broncos' practice squad before he was signed to the roster last week, will be the backup.

The Broncos also are signing veteran quarterback Ben DiNucci to their practice squad, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Sunday.

On Sunday, Payton called the notion that the starting and backup quarterbacks split practice reps during the regular season ""mythical,"" but he said Stidham has stayed sharp because he has faced the Broncos' starting defense every day in practice as the defensive game plan was installed each week.

""[Splitting reps on offense] just doesn't happen; in a workweek, the reps are limited and the starter wants them,"" Payton said. ""But one of Stiddy's strengths is his mental aptitude and his progressions and understanding plays. There would be practices I'm like looking at [DC] Vance [Joseph] getting pissed off because Stiddy's making our defense look bad. He's very accurate. He's a got a lot to his ball.""

The coach pointed to the success some backup quarterbacks have had throughout the years in fill-in roles, including Teddy Bridgewater's 5-0 run with the Saints when Drew Brees was injured in 2019 during Payton's tenure in New Orleans. Payton also noted that the Houston Texans went 3-0 in the three games backup Davis Mills started in place of C.J. Stroud this season. Stroud was knocked out of the Nov. 2 game against the Broncos with a concussion -- an 18-15 Denver win.

The coach added that the Broncos' staff will begin game planning in earnest Sunday night.

""Plan has always got to be built on the types and skill sets of players you're playing with,"" Payton said. ""Are there certain things Bo does differently than Stiddy? Absolutely.""

Payton also expanded on just how quickly Nix's injury diagnosis unfolded after Saturday's 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills. Nix suffered the fractured ankle on a first-and-10 from the Buffalo 36-yard line with 6 minutes, 4 seconds left in overtime when he was tackled for a 2-yard loss on a designed run.

He quickly jumped up after the tackle to get back into the huddle, though he had a slight limp. Two plays later, on a kneel-down, Nix's right ankle twisted awkwardly and he showed a pronounced limp as he moved back to the Broncos' sideline.

Payton said that when Nix got to the sideline after the kneel-down to center the ball for Wil Lutz's winning field goal, it was the first time the quarterback told him something was wrong.

""I kind of chest-bump him, jab him like, 'Fricking-a'; he's like, 'Careful,'"" Payton said. ""I'm like, 'You all right?' and he said, 'Man, it's hurting.'""

Payton did his initial postgame media gathering and returned to his office next to the locker room. ""There was a group in my office,"" he said. ""They didn't say anything, but I knew there was something [wrong].""

The coach was told that X-rays revealed Nix had a fracture.

He said he then spoke to Nix, who was in the hallway next to the Broncos' locker room with his wife, parents and Stidham.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0118%2Fr1602333_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 00:57:50.673000

Broncos QB Nix fractures ankle late in yesterday’s win over the Bills

Rams betting favourites tonight in the cold in Chicago against the Bears

If you haven’t heard it already, the Denver Broncos took out the Buffalo Bills in overtime in yesterday’s thrilling AFC Divisional Round game, 33-30, but the win cost them their quarterback, Bo Nix. Nix fractured his ankle on the game’s third last play and is done for the season.

Nix is heading to surgery on Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama, to fix it. Backup Jarrett Stidham now steps into the starting QB role. Stidham appeared in just one game this season, against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 8, just four snaps, including a kneel to end the game, in a 44-24 win.

Fractured Ankle

Nix finished yesterday going 26-for-46, 279 passing yards, three TDs and an interception. Despite spin doctoring to the contrary, this is a massive loss. We harken back to comments made to us later last week by Ethan Useloff, Sports Trader at Fanatics Sportsbook, about the impact on betting on the Bills if QB Josh Allen was ever injured and had to leave the game for back-up Mitch Trubisky.

“That will be a touchdown swing if Mitch Trubisky had to enter the game,” said Useloff. “Allen is that team, and if they were to lose him you can almost call that game over.”

Patriots’ Super Bowl Odds

Basically, they’re celebrating in Houston and New England today. Because the winner of Texans versus Patriots today won’t have to face Nix.

According to theScore Bet, immediately following last night’s win, the Broncos’ odds to win the Super Bowl reached as low as +325, but jumped back up as high as +1100 in the wake of the Bo Nix injury news (now +1000).

Despite still having to play their divisional round game today, the Patriots have gotten 28.5% of all Super Bowl Winner handle wagered since the end of Bills-Broncos. That’s the second-most handle accrued behind only the Seahawks’ 35% in that time, which coincides with the start of their dominant performance against the 49ers.

No. 5 Houston Texans at No. 2 New England Patriots, Today 3 p.m. EST

Bottom line, this game is the stiffest test the Patriots have had to face. Not to diminish Patriots’ QB Drake Maye, an MVP favourite, but he was sacked five times last weekend against the Chargers. Keep your eyes on the Texans’ front – Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter are the headliners, and defensive tackle Tommy Togiai had a good game in limited time last week in the Texans’ win over the Steelers.

Useloff thinks there’s some over-hype in this game, impacting the betting lines. The Seahawks and Rams are more superior than other NFC teams, he added, while the AFC Divisional Round teams are more closely grouped together in terms of Super Bowl betting odds. Useloff was saying late last week that any one of those four AFC Divisional Round teams could make the Super Bowl.

The Patriots-Texans line was shifting when we spoke with him.

Shifting Betting Lines

“I’m surprised that one’s not within a field goal,” he said. “I think that the Houston defence is one of the most feared defences I’ve seen in a while. I’m surprised to not have that game be within that three point mark, instead of at that three point mark. Patriots are third and outright betting right now for Fanatics in just total number of bets to win the Super Bowl.

And to me, although it makes sense why the Patriots have all the fans jumping on their bandwagon and a lot of supporters, this Texans defense is absolutely one of the best we’ve seen in recent history. They had such an incredible performance in Pittsburgh on Monday night. I know that there’s been a lot of talk about the schedule for New England, and I think that’s overblown just a bit.

“This Texans defence is going to get after Drake Maye. The left side of their line with Will Campbell has looked a little bit shoddy in New England. I expect Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson JR and the rest of that defensive line to absolutely get after Drake Maye and make him really uncomfortable. If the Patriots win this game, it will have to be low scoring, where their defence steps up.”

Still, remember that Rams QB Matthew Stafford spent years quarterbacking the Detroit Lions, which means regular games in not-so-temperate Green Bay and Chicago in November, December and January. Stafford has a degree in cold weather games.

Quarterback Bo Nix, the team’s leader and the architect of an NFL record 12 comeback wins during the regular season, suffered a season-ending ankle injury in overtime against the Bills and will be out for the rest of the postseason.

“Broncos QB Bo Nix suffered a season-ending broken bone in his ankle during today’s overtime, victory over Buffalo,” ESPN’s Adam Schefter wrote on his official X account. “With Bo Nix out for the season, Denver’s starting QB for next Sunday’s AFC Championship Game will be Jarrett Stidham. His backup now will be Sam Ehlinger.”

According to head coach Sean Payton, Nix was already scheduled to have surgery to repair his ankle on Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama.

Nix engineered another game-winning drive in what would prove to be his last time on the football field this season, setting up a 23-yard field goal by Will Lutz to send the Broncos to the AFC Championship Game, where they’ll host the winner of Sunday’s game between the Houston Texans and New England Patriots next Sunday in Denver.

Nix was 26-of-46 passing for 276 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception in the win over the Bills.

According to Schefter, Nix injured his ankle on the second-to-last play in overtime.

“We felt it was better to tell everyone now,” Broncos head coach Sean Payton said.

Stidham Hasn’t Started Game Since 2023

Stidham has been the Broncos’ backup quarterback since 2023, when he backed up Russell Wilson, and Nix’s backup for the last 2 seasons.

Nix and Stidham actually competed for the starting spot before the 2024 season and after Nix was selected in the first round (No. 12 overall) of the 2024 NFL draft.

Despite his disappointment in not becoming the starter for the Broncos, Stidham’s approach and how he plays when called upon has made him one of the NFL’s most coveted backup quarterbacks.

Stidham’s talents were on display in the Broncos‘ 30-9 preseason opener win over the San Francisco 49ers on August 9 — 14-of-15 passing for 136 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions to go with 3 carries for 36 yards in just 2 quarters.

Stidham spent 2023 as the backup to Russell Wilson and ended up going 1-1 in 2 starts and is 1-3 as a starter for his career.

Stidham was a fourth round pick (No. 133 overall) out of Auburn in the 2019 NFL draft and spent his first 3 seasons with the New England Patriots before spending 2 seasons with the Las Vegas Raiders.

Reactions to Nix Injury: Devastation & Heartbreak

Nix’s injury ends a streak of 36 consecutive starts to his career — every regular season game and 2 playoff games over the last 2 seasons.

The reaction to his injury was a mix of shock, devastation and heartbreak following Denver’s first playoff win in a decade.

Nix appeared to hurt himself running to the left to set up the game-winning field goal in overtime, but didn’t seem to show any effect when he got up. He limped off the field and spoke with training staff after taking a knee on the next play.

According to the NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, Nix would undergo surgery to repair his ankle.",https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2256809903-e1768703163205.jpg?quality=65&strip=all,N,,2026-01-19 02:00:27.041848

Nix's injury puts the Broncos in a state of flux as the franchise tries to win its fourth Super Bowl. What's next for Denver and its young quarterback?

Broncos reporter Jeff Legwold answered questions about the injury from the team's perspective, ESPN analytics writer Seth Walder gave his views on the Broncos' prospects this postseason and injury analyst Stephania Bell offered insight into Nix's next steps and potential long-term ramifications as he recovers.

What happened?

Broncos coach Sean Payton said Nix suffered the fracture on a first-and-10 play from the Bills' 36-yard line with 6:04 left in overtime. Nix lost 2 yards on a designed run when he was pulled to the ground by Buffalo safety Cole Bishop. Nix had a slight limp after the play but quickly moved back to the huddle.

He threw a long incompletion to wide receiver Marvin Mims Jr. on the next play in which Bills cornerback Tre'Davious White was flagged for pass interference. Nix moved down the field to get lined up with the offense and took the next snap for a kneel-down. During the kneel-down play, his right ankle twisted awkwardly and appeared to give out. Nix had a pronounced limp as he moved to the sideline before Lutz's game-winning kick. -- Legwold

Who is next up for the Broncos?

Jarrett Stidham is the Broncos' backup QB. He signed with Denver as a free agent in 2023, right after Payton was hired as head coach. Payton has often credited Stidham's experience and demeanor as keys to helping Nix's development in his first two NFL seasons. Stidham was a fourth-round pick by the New England Patriots in 2019 and spent three seasons there before he signed with the Las Vegas Raiders in 2022, when he was Derek Carr's backup.

Stidham, who cites time spent working with Tom Brady with the Patriots as pivotal to his development, started two games in 2023 after Payton benched Russell Wilson, throwing for two touchdowns with one interception. Stidham doesn't have Nix's mobility but is unafraid of pushing the ball downfield and has shown it in previous game action.

As for the passer behind Stidham, the Broncos' effort to keep Sam Ehlinger has worked out. Ehlinger turned down an offer to sign with the Indianapolis Colts and join their active roster earlier this season to remain on the Broncos' practice squad. -- Legwold

What can Denver do to help Stidham?

After three seasons with the Broncos, Payton believes Stidham is comfortable enough with the playbook to keep a full array of options in the game plan. Because Nix was part of the Broncos' run game, Payton might have to rethink how the quarterback fits into the rushing attack, though. Broncos running backs had only 10 carries while Nix had 12 in Saturday's win over the Bills. Nix also led the team with 29 rushing yards.

Nix has also been one of the league's toughest quarterbacks to sack since entering the NFL in 2024. Saturday was the 12th game this season in which he was sacked one or zero times. The Broncos might need some protection scheme tweaks with Stidham, who has been sacked 13 times in four career starts, including five times in one of his 2023 starts with the Broncos. -- Legwold

What is the immediate reaction from the Broncos?

Payton delivered the news after many Broncos had already left the locker room, so many players likely found out as they headed home. Payton will see some players Sunday, as they'll come to the team's facility to get medical treatment, and more Monday.

Those who heard the news at the stadium Saturday were immediately disappointed, especially for Nix. But the turnaround to prepare for the AFC Championship Game will force the Broncos to pivot quickly. Nix is scheduled to have surgery Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama, and then will likely be around his teammates later in the week. -- Legwold

Do the Broncos have any chance of beating the Patriots or Texans without Nix? Winning the Super Bowl?

I remember working on a roundtable like this eight years ago, writing off the Eagles' chances of winning the Super Bowl with Nick Foles after Carson Wentz was injured late in the season. That was a mistake, in part because that 2017 Eagles team had an elite roster that could support a backup quarterback. That's pretty much what the Broncos have, too. They have arguably the best offensive line in the league and a strong defense that can shut down the run and the pass.

I'm very skeptical of Denver's chances and would be stunned if confetti falls on the Broncos next weekend, much less in Super Bowl LX. But they're only two wins from a championship in a wide-open season. Because of the depth and talent on their roster, I won't completely rule them out. -- Walder

What is the longer-term impact? How long could Nix be out?

In the absence of full detail regarding Nix's ankle fracture, it is hard to provide specifics about his precise treatment and recovery. However, Payton saying postgame that Nix will undergo surgery indicates the fracture is unstable and requires implantation of hardware to stabilize it and ensure the bones are in proper alignment. The fact that they could report this immediately after the game indicates the fracture was clearly visible on X-ray without requiring additional imaging.

Healing from an ankle fracture repair is approximately 10 to 12 weeks, but restoring full joint range of motion, strength and dynamic function takes approximately three to four months. Given the timeline before training camp resumes, Nix will likely be on track to start the 2026 regular season, assuming no complications. -- Bell",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0118%2Fr1602103_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 22:59:29.135467

Darnold was a shock addition to the Seahawks’ injury report on Thursday with an oblique injury.

It had Seahawks fans cursing their luck after they earned the bye week and a well deserved extra week of rest.

His availability for the divisional round clash with the San Francisco 49ers just two days later became a serious concern.

On the day of the game, it was reported that Darnold was expected to play but with unknown limitations.

Erin Andrews gave Fox viewers a crucial insight into his injury status, which clearly didn’t have too much impact on the Seahawks star.

Andrews told the broadcast, “Sam Darnold didn’t come out in the early warmup, but he came out with his team throwing.

“Our broadcast crew had a chance to talk to him yesterday. He said he felt a lot better.

“Now, he did get tests done on Thursday, and Sam told us, ‘Once I saw the results of those tests, I felt mentally better’.

“He said, ‘I had never had an oblique injury before, so I was scared. But once I saw the results, I knew I was just going to have to deal with a little bit of pain’.”

Darnold dealt with the pain admirably as the Seahawks absolutely crushed the 49ers 41-6.

Highly sought-after Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak wisely kept Darnold’s passing game on a leash.

He only threw the ball 17 times with 12 completions, including one stunning touchdown throw to Jaxon Smith-Njigba.

Darnold recorded 124 passing yards while star running back Kenneth Walker had himself a day on the ground.

Walker carried the ball 19 times for 116 yards and an incredible three touchdowns.

Mike Macdonald’s defense were the real game winners however with two fumble recoveries, one interception and multiple fourth down turnovers.

The victory was the sixth time this season that Nix led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter or overtime.
Payton said he spoke to Nix briefly outside the locker room after the quarterback had been given the news from the Broncos' medical staff.","DENVER -- Roughly an hour after the Denver Broncos had left the field awash in the emotions of one of the franchise's most dramatic playoff wins, coach Sean Payton stepped back into an interview room to confirm what was already swirling in the aftermath as a rumor.

Payton began with ""not good news"" and then said quarterback Bo Nix had fractured his right ankle three plays before Wil Lutz kicked a 23-yard field goal in overtime that gave the Broncos a 33-30 win over the Buffalo Bills in Empower Field at Mile High on Saturday.

Payton said Nix will have surgery to repair the fracture Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama. It means Nix will miss whatever remains of the Broncos' postseason run and Jarrett Stidham will be the starting quarterback.

""[Nix] is a tough cookie,"" Payton said. ""I said, 'Listen I believe you're the second quarterback in his second year to take his team to the [conference] championship game and the first is [Patrick] Mahomes.' ... We'll rise up for the next challenge.""

On first-and-10 from the Buffalo 36-yard line with 6 minutes, 4 seconds left in overtime, Nix was tackled for a loss of 2 yards on a designed run. He quickly jumped up after the tackle to get back in the huddle but did have a slight limp.

He threw a deep incompletion intended for wide receiver Marvin Mims Jr. on the next play as Buffalo cornerback Tre'Davious White was flagged for pass interference. The ball was moved to the Bills' 8-yard line after the penalty, and Nix took the next snap and kneeled to stop the play.

On the kneel-down, his right ankle twisted awkwardly and Nix grimaced as he showed a pronounced limp as he moved back to the Broncos' sideline. Nix underwent X-rays after the game, and many Broncos players had left the locker room by the time Payton announced Nix's injury, ""so, in essence I'm telling them now,"" the coach said.

Nix finished Saturday's win 26-of-46 passing for 279 yards with three touchdowns and an interception. The victory was the sixth time this season that Nix led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter or overtime.

Stidham, who was signed by the Broncos as a free agent in 2023 -- Payton's first season -- has appeared in one game this season. Stidham played four snaps, including a kneel-down to end the game, in the Broncos' 44-24 win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 8.

He appeared in three games in the 2024 season, Nix's rookie year, but did not attempt a pass. His last significant playing time came in 2023, when he started the final two games of the season after Payton benched Russell Wilson.

Stidham threw two touchdowns and an interception in those two games combined, including a 16-9 win over the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 17. Sam Ehlinger, who spent most of the season on the Broncos' practice squad before he was signed to the roster last week, will be the backup.

""Stiddy is ready to go,"" Payton said. ""... He's ready, he's ready. I feel like I've got a two who's capable of starting for a number of teams, and I know he feels the same way. Watch out, just watch.""

Payton said he spoke to Nix briefly outside the locker room after the quarterback had been given the news from the Broncos' medical staff. He said Nix told him it was the third time he had suffered a fractured ankle in his football career, including once in high school and once at Auburn.

""[He is] such a strong faith-based guy, [he's] sitting in the hallway with his family,"" Payton said.

On what he thinks the team's reaction will be, Payton added, ""They'll be disappointed, will be a lot of emotions, but then the refocus takes place. We celebrate the season for him. Listen, Stiddy is ready, we'll be ready for the next challenge. ... [Stidham] is experienced. He's played in games.

According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Broncos are signing veteran quarterback Ben DiNucci to their practice squad ahead of the AFC Championship Game.

DiNucci has spent time with the Broncos and under head coach Sean Payton in the past, so he's already familiar with the team's offensive system, which likely led to Denver deciding he was the guy to bring in.

The signing comes one day after Nix suffered a broken bone in his ankle that will require surgery and end his season. Nix came down with the issue in the overtime victory over the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round on Saturday.

A former seventh-round pick of the Dallas Cowboys in 2020, DiNucci has only appeared in three games during his career, all of which came in his rookie year.

In all, DiNucci has completed 23-of-43 passes for 219 yards and zero touchdowns to zero picks.

DiNucci also had a stint in the XFL in 2023, where he completed 64.7% of his passes for 2,671 yards and 20 touchdowns to 13 interceptions.

Payton has announced that backup Jarrett Stidham will start for Denver in next week's AFC title game, with Sam Ehlinger backing him up.

""Stiddy is ready to go,"" Payton said. ""... He's ready, he's ready. I feel like I've got a two who's capable of starting for a number of teams, and I know he feels the same way. Watch out, just watch.""

The New England Patriots are fighting for their first AFC championship game berth since the Tom Brady era today. The visiting Houston Texans, with their tough defense, are the challengers standing in their way.

New England leads by two scores before halftime. If they want to run out the clock in the second half, they'll have to do so without their veteran running back.

Rhamondre Stevenson is questionable to return after suffering an eye injury. He was seen on the broadcast of the game sitting on the bench with his right eye shut.

Stevenson had just three carries before leaving the game with an injury but managed 25 yards rushing. He also had a catch for nine yards.

New England will likely be leaning on rookie TreVeyon Henderson to take the majority of the touches out of the backfield. The Patriots also have veteran D'Ernest Johnson active for the game as well.

Carries: 4

Rushing yards: 30

Stevenson's been splitting touches out of the backfield with rookie second-round pick Henderson all season. He'll take the majority of the carries with Stevenson sidelined.

This is after the Broncos took down Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round on Saturday, 33-30. The thrilling contest required an extra period to determine a winner. In the end, the Broncos prevailed to book their spot in the next round against either the New England Patriots or the Houston Texans.

Nix turned in a strong performance in the win. The 25-year-old quarterback registered 26-of-46 completed passes for 279 yards, three touchdowns and one interception, adding 29 yards on the ground on 12 carries.

Nix was involved in a contentious incident late in overtime. It turned out to be a pivotal moment in the contest, which ultimately led to a game-winning field goal by the Broncos.

With 6:09 left in overtime, Nix threw an incomplete pass to wide receiver Courtland Sutton. As he released the pass, Bills defensive end Joey Bosa came in with a late tackle, resulting in a roughing the passer penalty against the Buffalo star.

According to the NFL rulebook, “any physical acts against a player who is in a passing posture (i.e. before, during, or after attempting a pass) which, in the game official’s judgment, are unwarranted by the circumstances of the play will be called as fouls.”

Bosa is now bracing for a punishment decision from the NFL for his personal foul on Nix. The league will review this incident to determine if the foul was excessive enough to warrant a fine. Per league rules, a roughing the passer penalty can be subjected to a fine of $17,389 for a first offense and $23,186 for a second.

Bosa has already been fined for a roughing the passer penalty earlier this season. The five-time Pro Bowler was fined $17,389 for a foul on Tampa Bay Buccaneers QB Baker Mayfield in Week 11.

The Broncos opted to decline the 15-yard penalty on Bosa’s roughing the passer infraction. There were two fouls on the play. Bills cornerback Taron Johnson was flagged for defensive pass interference against Sutton. Denver accepted that penalty, resulting in an automatic first down.

The Broncos ended the drive with a 23-yard, game-winning field goal by Wil Lutz.

It’s the end of the line for Bosa and the Bills, who have now been eliminated from the playoffs. Nix and the Broncos, on the other hand, will host the conference championship game at Empower Field at Mile High on Sunday.

However, a former NFL defensive star gave the Patriots an ominous reminder.

New England could face a Broncos squad led by Jarrett Stidham for the AFC title if Mike Vrabel’s team defeats the Houston Texans on Sunday. Yet the Patriots know better than most teams not to count out a second-string quarterback.

Gerald McCoy brought up an unpleasant memory Sunday on NFL Network’s “NFL GameDay” when noting that Nick Foles led the Philadelphia Eagles to a Super Bowl LII win over Tom Brady’s Patriots in place of Carson Wentz.

“I got two words for you: Nick Foles,” McCoy said. “This is the best of the best. This is the NFL. You don’t go into somebody’s house thinking, ‘Oh, he’s the backup quarterback.'”

Of course, the Patriots have other business to handle before thinking about the Broncos. They won’t get a chance to play the AFC’s vulnerable No. 1 seed unless they snap the Texans’ 10-game winning streak on Sunday.

McCoy advised the Patriots to stay focused on the AFC Divisional Round rather than dream of a Super Bowl trip. If they advance, they shouldn’t take the Broncos lightly without Nix.

“They need to worry about tonight,” McCoy said. “Forget next week. Don’t worry about next week … But if you go into next week thinking it’s going to be sweet, you got another thing coming. Because this is the best of the best, and Sean Payton will have them ready.”",https://s47719.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/Bo-Nix-e1763390084811.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 15:59:46.524353

Left tackle Charles Cross, who was playing in his first game since injuring his hamstring in a Week 15 win over the Colts, left in the third quarter with a foot injury and was replaced by Amari Kight.

After the game, Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald said that the early indications on Charbonnet are that it is not a serious injury, though they'll need to do imaging to confirm that, and that Cross coming out was more of a precautionary move with he Seahawks enjoying a big lead.

""Optimistic with Charbs,"" Macdonald said. ""We've got to get an image and stuff, but early indications are hopefully it's OK structurally. You never know with these things, but he wasn't able to come back, obviously. And Charles was really out of caution.

Bo Nix Injury Update: National Football League (NFL) player Bo Nix has reportedly broke his right ankle late in overtime of the Denver Broncos' divisional-round victory over Buffalo on Saturday and will have surgery that will sideline him for the rest of the playoffs.

According to Payton, Nix got hurt on a designed quarterback run that resulted in a loss of two yards. He was seen limping back to the huddle, but it never looked like a serious injury during the game.

Taking to X, Denver Broncos coach Sean Payton announced that the team's 25-year-old quarterback would be having surgery to repair a fractured bone in his ankle after sustaining an injury during the game against the Buffalo Bills on Saturday.

Let's learn how dangerous these injuries can turn and how long does it take for an individual to recover completely after undergoing a surgery.

According to The American Sports Journal, ankle injuries such as ankle bone fractures, especially in high-impact sports like American football, can take serious turn that can only be managed with proper rehab (one that includes surgical interventions). When the joint is unstable or weight-bearing bones are involved the affect of such injuries can be at their worst. Dr Robert Downey, says ""In quarterbacks, ankle injuries can be especially concerning because they affect mobility, balance, throwing mechanics and long-term joint health"".

How Dangerous Is a Broken Ankle?

As the NFL player is set to miss the rest of the matches, let's take a close look what such injuries look like and how worse they can turn.

As per Dr. Norman Waldrop, an orthopedic surgeon who is associated with the NFL, a broken ankle can range from a simple hairline fracture to a complex break involving multiple bones and ligaments.

Experts suggest that some of the health issues that a sport person is expected to suffer after such injuries are:

An acute pain and stiffness near the affected area.

Unable to move properly

Post-traumatic arthritis

Prone to future injuries

Understand that if not treated properly, ankle fractures can significantly shorten athletic careers.

How Long Does Recovery Takes?

As per experts, recovery from such injuries takes between 0-6 weeks to 6-9 months, depending solely on the intensity of the injury or the type of injury.

As per NFL officials Nix will undergo surgery and will only join the team after undergoing proper rehab for recovery.",https://st1.thehealthsite.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/01hwtjhpw1g7yt5meam5.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 14:59:04.036782

Denver Broncos coach Sean Payton announced that the team’s 25-year-old quarterback would be having surgery to repair a fractured bone in his ankle after sustaining an injury during the game against the Buffalo Bills on Saturday, Jan. 17, according to the team’s official X account.

The athlete suffered the injury on a first-and-10 play from the Bills’ 36-yard line with just over six minutes left in overtime, per ESPN. After being tackled by Buffalo safety Cole Bishop, Nix could be seen walking with a slight limp as he made his way toward the team huddle.

During the following kneel-down play, however, Nix’s right ankle seemed to twist awkwardly, after which the athlete's limp became more apparent as he moved to the sideline before Will Lutz led the team to victory with his game-winning field goal. The second-year quarterback will be sidelined for the rest of the season.

""There will be a lot of emotions, and then the refocus takes place,” Payton told reporters during a postgame press conference. “We celebrate the season for him.”

Dr. Norman Waldrop, an orthopedic surgeon who previously operated on Joe Burrow’s turf toe earlier in the season, will allegedly perform the procedure on Nix’s ankle on Jan. 20, according to NFL insider Ian Rapoport.

Jarrett Stidham will replace Nix as the starting quarterback for the remainder of the playoffs.

Seahawks: Charbonnet injured a knee in the second quarter and did not return.
Seahawks: Are one victory away from the fourth Super Bowl appearance in franchise history and first in 11 years.","SEATTLE (AP) — Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor and Doug Baldwin hyped up the famed “12th Man” crowd in Seattle, providing a throwback to the Seahawks’ fearsome “Legion of Boom” teams from the 2010s.

Then, in their first playoff game in front of home fans in nearly a decade, the Seahawks found a new level of dominance.

Rashid Shaheed returned the returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown, Kenneth Walker III rushed for three scores and Seattle forced three turnovers in a never-in-doubt 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday night that sent the top-seeded Seahawks to the NFC championship game.

“One of our most complete games, for sure,” defensive lineman Leonard Williams said. “(Shaheed) starting the game off like that set the tone.”

Sam Darnold threw a touchdown pass and got his first career playoff win in his first season with the Seahawks (15-3), who will host either the Chicago Bears or the Los Angeles Rams next Sunday with a trip to the Super Bowl at stake.

The Seahawks led 7-0 13 seconds into the game thanks to Shaheed, who fielded the opening kick and took it 95 yards to the end zone. It was the fourth kickoff return for a touchdown to open a playoff game since 2000 and the longest postseason kick return in franchise history.

“I was so hyped,” defensive lineman Byron Murphy II said. “I wasn’t expecting that, but when he did it, I knew the game was over then. I already knew.”

Darnold, who had been listed as questionable because of an oblique injury, guided the Seahawks on two more scoring drives before San Francisco got on the board with the first of its two field goals. As he has all season, Darnold impressed his teammates with his toughness.

“He told us he was going to do whatever it takes to get back and play for us,” offensive lineman Grey Zabel said. “That was a gutsy performance by him, not feeling his best. He continues to just be a leader in the huddle, on the field, on the sidelines.”

After he flopped in his playoff debut last season with the Minnesota Vikings by taking nine sacks in a 27-9 loss to the Rams, Darnold completed 12 of 17 passes for 124 yards and connected with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a touchdown in the star receiver’s playoff debut.

Seattle hadn’t played in the postseason since the 2020 season, when it lost at home to the Rams with no fans in the stands because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 49ers (13-6) were never competitive in the second-most lopsided playoff loss in franchise history. San Francisco lost 49-3 to the New York Giants in the divisional round in the 1986 season.

The Niners were missing three injured All-Pros: tight end George Kittle, linebacker Fred Warner and defensive end Nick Bosa. Star left tackle Trent Williams, who played through a hamstring injury, was proud of his team for getting as far in the playoffs as it did.

“When you’re playing with guys you’re signing off the practice squad,” Williams said, “guys (you are) taking off the street — you got to temper expectations a bit.”

Brock Purdy completed 15 of 27 passes for 140 yards with an interception and a lost fumble against the Seahawks’ “Dark Side” defense. Seattle also recovered a fumble by tight end Jake Tonges.

“Everything’s working for us, to be honest,” safety Nick Emmanwori said. “Everything’s working. We fly to the ball, we’ve got (a) great scheme, great coaches, great players. I (think) it’s hard for teams to find a way to score on us or beat us straight up.”

Walker waltzes to career night

Walker’s three rushing touchdowns tied him with Shaun Alexander for the most in a playoff game in franchise history. Two of the scores came after halftime, and he celebrated one by chucking the ball into the crowd.

“I’d do it more,” Walker said, “but I’d get fined for it.”

Walker finished with 116 yards rushing, his most since his rookie year in 2022, and he picked up the slack after Zach Charbonnet was injured during the game. The Seahawks ran for 175 yards, their third most this season.

“You can see it, how they’re breathing, they’re tired, they’re slow to get up,” Walker said. “You can see it’s demoralizing to them.”

Pursuit of Purdy

The Seahawks’ front seven made life difficult for Purdy, chasing him across the field while sacking him twice. With the Niners thin at receiver, Purdy scrambled five times for 37 yards and frequently threw on the run.

“It’s no secret in terms of their style of play,” Purdy said. “Trying to make a quarterback check it down and play deep to short. Then within that, have a good pass rush. That’s a good defense, man.”

Injuries

49ers: RB Christian McCaffrey (stinger) was injured in the second quarter and returned in the third quarter before exiting the game for good. Tonges injured a foot and did not return.

Seahawks: Charbonnet injured a knee in the second quarter and did not return. LT Charles Cross injured a foot in the third quarter and did not return.

Unfortunately, Nix is out for the season, and the Broncos are stuck playing their biggest game in over 10 years without their franchise guy. If it’s time to live in fantasy land, how about Tom Brady returning for one last Super Bowl run?

Find out whether Brady could even return on such short notice to add some more silverware.

Details on Tom Brady’s Availability

Pump the brakes on Brady because it ain’t happening. In fact, the legendary quarterback isn’t even allowed to play for the Broncos even if he wanted to. He owns a minority stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, and this prevents Brady from signing with Denver.

So, it’s going to be Jarrett Stidham for Denver. Stidham will replace Nix, the 14th-ranked quarterback in the league according to PFSN’s QB Impact Metric.

Stidham has started four games in six years in the NFL. He has just eight touchdowns and eight interceptions in his limited action. Now, he’s got a chance to lead his team to the Super Bowl.

Head coach Sean Payton is ready to rock with Stidham. It’s so hard to learn an offense and playbook in a short period of time. The AFC Championship isn’t the time to be playing around at the quarterback position. Payton trusts his guy and will do everything he can to get him ready.

There are only scraps left in the quarterback market. There is no one on the market who would be instilling more hope in Broncos fans than just rocking with Stidham.

Current Free Agent QBs

Ryan Tannehill, 37, hasn’t taken an NFL snap since 2023. In November, he told reporters he believes “that chapter is closed.” Colin Kaepernick, 38, last played in 2016 and spent nearly nine years waiting for a call that never came. Jake Fromm, 27, was released by Detroit last April and remains unsigned. Taylor Heinicke, 32, was released by the Chargers in August and hasn’t found a roster since.

The rest of the free agent quarterback market is equally uninspiring. Tim Boyle signed with Tennessee last March, was waived in August after a disastrous preseason outing, and remains unsigned.

Dorian Thompson-Robinson bounced from Cleveland to Philadelphia to the UFL’s Orlando Storm. Clayton Tune was cut by both Arizona and Green Bay this season.

Bryce Perkins won UFL MVP last spring, got a brief Panthers audition in August, was waived within a week, and ended up in the Canadian Football League.

The Texans and Patriots will be gearing up for their matchup tomorrow with one eye looking at the opportunity to take on the Broncos, led by Stidham. Both of these defenses will relish the chance to make the Super Bowl, with the Broncos’ offense weakened.

Luckily for these teams, Brady can’t come back to try to get his eighth Super Bowl. If you’re doubting that Brady could do it, come on. He did it with the Buccaneers on the wrong side of 40; if there’s anyone who could, it’s the seven-time Super Bowl champion.

Seahawks 41, 49ers 6

'The Seahawks had the best offseason of any team.' Overreaction?

No, not an overreaction. The Seahawks went into the 2025 offseason intent on and expecting to sign Geno Smith to a contract extension. When it became apparent to them that Smith wasn't interested in extending his deal at their numbers, they traded him to the Raiders and signed Sam Darnold. Say what you will about Darnold, but the 2025 Seahawks went 14-3 -- same record as Darnold's 2024Vikings -- and now he has a home game Jan. 25 in the NFC Championship Game.

Seahawks GM John Schneider went about his offseason the same way he would have had he landed his first choice at quarterback. He signed DeMarcus Lawrence. He signed Cooper Kupp because he's a better blocker at this point than Tyler Lockett. He drafted Nick Emmanwori in the second round. Schneider freaking loves the second round. Even as someone who likes to see players get as much money as they can and wishes the top QBs would push harder to move the market upward for others, I still have to appreciate a philosophy like Seattle's approach: ""Do we have to pay our quarterback $50-plus million per year if he still hasn't shown he's that guy?""

A Seahawks employee told me after the team's wild Week 16 victory over the Rams, ""We're trying to win championships here,"" and the Seahawks obviously are living that. Seattle has lost three games all season, and the margins were four, three and two points. Two of those losses were to division rivals, one of which they eliminated Saturday. Is Darnold the second coming of Joe Montana? No. Of John Elway? No. Of Patrick Mahomes? No. But the Seahawks decided, at some point, that they intend to be the example of how to win a championship without paying great quarterback money toa pretty good quarterback because there's a championship-caliber roster around him.

Kudos to the Seahawks for treating the QB portion of their offseason the way they would have treated any other portion of it. They didn't get the player they wanted, but they knew they could still win with this quarterback because of everything else they do well. Hiring Mike Macdonald as head coach was a last offseason move, not a this offseason move, but it was still one that impacted their approach to this offseason. And here they still are. -- Graziano

The lingering question: Will the 49ers be NFC favorites with a healthy team next season?

It's too early to say, of course. But spin it forward for me. The Seahawks will likely be the favorite, barring some catastrophic injury between now and then. The Rams could be up there, as well, especially if they finish the NFC playoffs strong ... but Matthew Stafford's career longevity is always going to be a question that hurts them in the futures markets. Meanwhile, the 49ers still have most of their main players under contract.

Trent Williams' contract is expiring, and the offensive line clearly needs help across the board. Wide receiver is a little thin with theBrandon Aiyuk situation unclear and Jauan Jenningsapproaching free agency. But that young defense, which was hammered by injuries this season, will returnNick Bosa and Fred Warner. AndYetur Gross-Matos and Jordan Elliott are the only two expiring contracts there. This group will benefit from postseason experience next season and will presumably add to the pass rush.

Of course, the 49ers will see if they get through the offseason without losing defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, who was key to their surprising success despite all the injuries. Saleh has interviewed with the Titans and Ravens already and is a deservedly hot name on the head coaching circuit. If he gets a job, San Francisco will be forced back on the defensive coordinator carousel.

It's also worth noting that the 49ers, who had a very easy schedule entering this season, will play a third-place schedule next season despite their postseason appearance. With only a few moves in offseason housekeeping and a regression to the mean in injury luck, the Niners should be considered a deep NFC playoff team once again. -- Solak

Broncos 33, Bills 30

'The Broncos are done without Bo Nix.' Overreaction?

No, not an overreaction. The Broncos barely won Saturday's game. Buffalo had to turn the ball over five times -- including once in overtime -- or else Nix might not have broken his ankle in the first place. And certainly, without Nix's clutch play in the fourth quarter and overtime, Denver wouldn't have won and advanced to a home AFC Championship Game.

But now? You want me to believe the Broncos are going to beat Houston or New England with Jarrett Stidham at quarterback? And even if they do, does anyone believe they can then win the Super Bowl? I'm sorry, Jarrett, but it just doesn't feel to me like this Broncos team is good enough to pull a 2017 Eagles and win this thing without their starting quarterback.

The Broncos have a good defense, yes. We know this about them. But they weren't super awesome Saturday against a Bills team that moved the ball extremely well between turnovers, and they haven't been elite in the way that defenses such as Seattle and Houston have been -- at least not over the second half of this season. The Broncos do run the ball better than most think, but c'mon. We all watched this game. The Bills handed the Broncos 10 points at the tail end of the first half, then three more at the start of the second, and Buffalo still had a fourth-quarter lead that Nix found a way to overcome. Nix isn't a perfect player, but what he can do with his legs and what he can do in the clutch are separating factors that Stidham just doesn't offer.

The Broncos defense is going to have to play the game of a lifetime next week -- even if it's against Houston's inconsistent offense -- if it wants to lug this team into the Super Bowl. And even if it collects a bunch of turnovers and sneaks into the big game, Denver is then going to have to beat a team that has had two weeks off and likely still has its starting quarterback.

It's a shame. It would have been fun to see what Sean Payton and this Broncos team could have done. Payton could have been the first coach to win the Super Bowl with two different teams. But in the wake of the Nix injury news, all of that is a lot harder to imagine. -- Graziano

The lingering question: Why do the Bills keep losing in the postseason?

I have no idea. What is there to say? The Bills turned the football over five times, and no team that turns the ball over five times deserves to be in the game at all. Josh Allen's end-of-half fumble to let the Broncos go up 20-10 was an inexcusable mistake. He was stripped to start the second half to give Denver an even bigger lead. He threw a pick immediately off a key defensive takeaway.

It felt like Allen was digging the hole, and then as always, Allen was the one to pull the Bills back out. But there were too many misses. Allen failed to connect with Khalil Shakir on a third-and-8 screen in the red zone that could have allowed him to score, and he missed an open Dawson Knox at the end of regulation on a throw that could have walked the game off. Allen was simultaneously one of the biggest reasons the Bills were still in that game, while also being one of the biggest reasons they fell short.

The Bills have now made it to seven consecutive postseasons with Allen at the helm, which means they've suffered seven postseason losses. There's really no unifying factor on the field, though. Wide receiver talent was a big deal in this game; Allen was 0-for-9 throwing 20-plus yards downfield, and downfield production is often a receiver stat. The pass rush has been an issue and was again in this game; Nix was pressured on 20% of his dropbacks, and the Bills needed to send blitzes to get home. Defensive back depth was also a big deal; two of Nix's three touchdowns came targeting backup defensive backs.

Still, when you've lost seven playoff games, there are some obvious unifying factors -- coach Sean McDermott, GM Brandon Beane and Allen. The Bills' triumvirate has been in place for the better part of a decade and has yet to get over the hump. Whether fair or unfair, the buck stops at the top, and the fact that the Bills have failed to make a Super Bowl in Allen's tenure despite seven postseason appearances is an enormous failure.

If the Bills make changes, I'd totally get it. If they don't, I'd totally get it, too. They've been so close so many times. What a devastating loss.-- Solak

“My ankle doesn’t feel right,” Nix said to Payton, a Broncos source told The Denver Post.
But they thought, in the moment, it could've been just a high-ankle sprain, as the Broncos source told The Post.
Nix, Payton said, had fractured a bone in his right ankle.
Nix told Payton -- as he's repeated to reporters multiple times -- that God had a plan for him.","Bo Nix popped, again, back onto the soles of his feet. The same way he’d done through a sophomore season of brutal hits and blistering comebacks at Auburn, always down and never out. The same he’d done for 63 straight games since transferring to Oregon in 2022, the move that put him on a collision course toward changing the fate of football in Denver.

And here, with the Broncos’ greatest win in the last decade all but wrapped up, Nix went to the sideline and told Sean Payton the five haunting words that might derail this dream in Denver.

“My ankle doesn’t feel right,” Nix said to Payton, a Broncos source told The Denver Post.

Keeler: If Broncos’ Jarett Stidham can be steady as Marvin Mims, Denver will be OK

A first-and-10 designed run for Nix had come up empty the previous play, as Bills safety Cole Bishop zipped through Denver's formation to wrap up the Broncos quarterback by the ankles for a loss of two. Nix came up limping ever so slightly, as the broadcast showed. His face, though, looked a little worse for wear. Broncos coaches knew he was hurt from that statement alone. But they thought, in the moment, it could've been just a high-ankle sprain, as the Broncos source told The Post.

""The kid's tough as nails,"" the source said. ""So -- this kid's a warrior. He's a competitor.""

Nix took a few-step drop on second down from Buffalo's 38-yard-line, reared back, and dropped in a perfect ball to Marvin Mims that drew a pass-interference flag on Bills corner Tre'Davious White. Game over. Season over for Buffalo.

Season over for Denver, maybe, too.

Two plays later, Nix took a knee to ice an eventual game-winning field goal from kicker Wil Lutz. A minute later, orange jerseys spilled out across the grass at Empower Field, reveling in a 33-30 overtime win over Buffalo that had landed squarely on the shoulders of their 25-year-old quarterback. Defensive tackle Malcolm Roach raised his fists to the heavens. Cornerback Pat Surtain II spread his arms and pattered around the green like a self-controlled airplane. None of them had any idea as to what was wrong with Nix until Payton, in street clothes, strode back to the postgame podium for the second time Saturday night after the madness cleared.

Nix, Payton said, had fractured a bone in his right ankle. He'd be out for the year.

Renck: Super Bo or bust? Nix breaks ankle. Jarrett Stidham, you got next

""I would've tried to kept it -- so I could talk to the team first,"" Payton told reporters. ""But the odds of something like this being kept quiet until Monday at 9:00 (a.m.) are impossible. And so, I felt like, in essence -- I'm talking to the team now.

""So, look, they'll be disappointed,"" Payton continued. ""There'll be a lot of emotions, and then the refocus takes place.""

But how do these No. 1-seeded Broncos refocus, just two games from hoisting a Lombardi Trophy, without the young arm and leader this entire organization has been built around?

In December, talking with The Denver Post about Payton's approach to roster-building, backup quarterback Sam Ehlinger said, ""it's all about Bo."" Offensive-line pieces such as Garett Bolles and Quinn Meinerz have been developed and extended in front of him. Defensive pieces such as Talanoa Hufanga and Dre Greenlaw were brought in to increase Denver's overall strength at playing complementary football. And Nix's level of responsibility and trust in Payton's offense has only grown throughout 2025 -- particularly as starting running back J.K. Dobbins went down in November.

In the locker room Saturday night -- before the Nix injury news, tight end Adam Trautman's eyes popped as The Post recounted Nix's final statistics against the Bills. Denver's second-year quarterback threw the ball 46 times (for 279 yards, three touchdowns and a pick). He ran the ball 12 times (for 29 yards). All in all, the Broncos ran a total of 68 plays from the line of scrimmage in their win against Buffalo.

Nix either threw the ball or ran the ball himself on 85% of them.

""Oh, wow,"" Trautman said, angling his head in slight disbelief. ""Gosh.""

""I think it's great,"" Trautman said, after a question on Payton's belief in Nix. ""And Bo's earned the trust. Because we've been in situations like this ... we've been in these positions all year.""

They were in that same position again on Saturday, staring directly down the barrel of a 14-3 season ending unceremoniously in the AFC divisional round. Denver assembled with four minutes to play in regulation, down 27-23 after a true seesaw of a playoff game, its offense having once again sputtered to a halt in a season of fits and starts.

Nobody flinched, as Trautman recalled, because of the man in the middle.

""It's like, 'Alright. We got Bo. Let's see what happens,'"" Trautman said. ""You're not like, 'Oh, we gotta be careful!'

""It's like, 'Nah, let's go.'""

Nix didn't say anything specific, as Trautman remembered. It was just feel. The earned confidence of a quarterback who'd orchestrated a league-high seven game-winning drives in the regular season, and who left tackle Garett Bolles said has ""ice in his veins."" Nix hit Courtland Sutton for 11 yards to start the drive, and Sutton again for 25 on a third-and-11 three plays later, and dropped a beauty into Marvin Mims Jr.'s outstretched arms to cap off yet another go-ahead fourth-quarter drive.

""Threw a freakin' dime to Marv,"" tight end Evan Engram said, postgame.

Renck: Super Bo or bust? Nix breaks ankle. Jarrett Stidham, you got next

Less than an hour later, though, Nix was sitting in a hallway in Empower Field with his family, mulling the news. Payton, the man who'd handpicked him out of Oregon, came over. Nix told Payton -- as he's repeated to reporters multiple times -- that God had a plan for him.

""I said, 'I didn't realize that,'"" Payton joked. ""I said, 'If I hadn't known that, I wouldn't have drafted you.'""

Payton, too, told Nix that this Broncos team has lost key players all year. They played Sunday without Dobbins, starting center Luke Wattenberg and safety Brandon Jones. And the head coach told his quarterback that they'd ""rise up for the next challenge.""

The man whom Payton will count on, in that case, is 29-year-old backup Jarrett Stidham. And there's a strong sense of belief throughout the staff and organization in Stidham, who put on a show in preseason and began his career playing behind Tom Brady in New England. Payton, for one, put on a confident face at Saturday's second postgame presser.

""I said this at the beginning of the season -- I feel like I've got a No. 2 that's capable of starting for a handful, a number of teams,"" Payton said. ""And I know he feels the same way. So watch out. Just watch.""

Payton, too, has talked about ""painting the picture"" for the quarterback multiple times in building this Broncos roster. That didn't apply to just Nix. That's this QB room in general, with Stidham and veteran Sam Ehlinger under the watchful eye of rising Denver assistant Davis Webb.

But Nix was the soul of this Broncos team, with an earned confidence in moments like Saturday's. And Denver will have to find a way to carry the faith without him.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TDP-L-BRONCOS-BILLSA03_2120x.jpg?w=1024&h=632,N,,2026-01-18 14:00:39.456725

He said Nix broke his right ankle a few plays before Lutz’s kick sent the top-seeded Broncos (15-3) to the AFC championship game against either New England or Houston.

“Stiddy’s ready,” Payton declared. “He’s ready. I said this at the beginning of the season I’ve got a 2 that’s capable of starting for a number of teams. And I know he feels the same way. So, watch out.”

Stidham has appeared in 20 games in six NFL seasons, starting four and winning one.

Nix got hurt on a keeper where he lost 2 yards and was tackled by safety Cole Bishop. Nix was limping after the play, but there was no indication that he suffered such a serious injury.

On the next play, Nix threw a deep pass to Marvin Mims Jr. that drew a 30-yard pass interference flag and got the Broncos well into field-goal range. Nix then took a knee to center the ball for Lutz’s game-ending field goal.

Nix tied Russell Wilson’s NFL record with two dozen victories in his first two seasons. Saturday’s victory was his first in the playoffs. The Broncos lost last year at Buffalo but Nix led Denver to the AFC’s top seed this season.

“He’s a tough cookie,” Payton said. “And this team all year has lost key players and will rise up for the next challenge.”

Before word of Nix’s injury broke, Denver was jubilant over the Broncos’ first playoff victory in a decade.

Denver’s game-winning drive came after nickel back Ja’Quan McMillian intercepted Allen’s deep pass in overtime. McMillian’s pick was Denver’s fifth takeaway of the game after they were minus-3 in turnover differential during the season.

McMillian wrested the ball away from Brandin Cooks at the Broncos 20-yard line when a field goal would have won the game for Buffalo (13-6).

“He actually had the ball coming down and I had my hand on the ball,” McMillian said. “I was able to take it from him. I fell on top of him, just held the ball up, showed the fans some love.”

Cooks said he thought it was a catch.

“I feel that way,” he said. “But at the end of the day, you don’t, you know, no matter, ultimately this is where we’re sitting now.”

Referee Carl Cheffers said in a pool report, “The receiver has to complete the process of a catch. He was going to the ground as part of the process of the catch and he lost possession of the ball when he hit the ground. The defender gained possession of it at that point. The defender is the one that completed the process of the catch, so the defender was awarded the ball.”

Cooks said he just has to make sure next time not to leave it in the “officials’ hands.”

Or McMillian’s.

Nix said nothing about being hurt during a postgame interview with CBS, and he sounded as if he was looking forward to the next game.

“It’s great to have home-field advantage in a situation like this. It’s exciting. This is why you play the game, this is why you compete. You get to playoff football, and good things happen,” Nix said.

Former Broncos kicker Matt Prater nailed a 50-yard field goal with 5 seconds left in regulation, knotting it up at 30-all. That came after Nix’s 26-yard touchdown throw to Mims with 55 seconds left had given Denver a 30-27 lead.

Allen, who hadn’t turned the ball over in his previous six playoff appearances, threw two interceptions and lost two fumbles.

“I felt like I let my teammates down,” a teary-eyed Allen said.

The Bills failed once again to reach the Super Bowl with Allen under center even though Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson weren’t standing in his way this time as that trio of franchise quarterbacks all missed the postseason party.

Coming off the first road playoff win of his career, Allen’s first three turnovers helped Denver built a 23-10 lead before he threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Keon Coleman and a 14-yarder to Dalton Kincaid to give Buffalo a 24-23 lead early in the fourth quarter.

Quick strikes

The Broncos scored 10 points in the final 22 seconds of the first half to take a 20-10 lead into the locker room, and they got their third takeaway just two plays into the second half on Nik Bonitto’s strip-sack of Allen that was recovered by Malcolm Roach at the Bills 17, leading to a field goal.

Denver avenged a 31-7 loss at Buffalo in the playoffs last year.

“We weren’t ready last year,” Payton said. “But we were ready today.”

“I feel like I’ve got a two that’s capable of starting for an ample number of teams,” Payton told reporters after announcing Bo Nix’s season-ending ankle fracture. “So watch out. Watch. Just watch.”

The Broncos won’t sign a free agent quarterback off the street before the AFC Championship Game. They shouldn’t. The Philip Rivers experiment that Indianapolis ran this season — and its 0-3 record — provides a cautionary tale in real time.

Why Denver’s Best Option Is Already in the Building

Rivers came out of a five-year retirement at 44 years old to rescue the Colts’ playoff hopes after Daniel Jones tore his Achilles in Week 14. He knew Shane Steichen’s system intimately. Fourteen of his former teammates still played in Indianapolis. The training staff, the equipment room, and the terminology were all familiar. Rivers completed 63.0% of his passes and posted respectable numbers across three starts.

However, the Colts lost all three games.

Learning an NFL offense in a week is effectively impossible. Payton runs one of the league’s most nuanced systems, demanding precise timing and route adjustments that take months to internalize. Stidham has spent three seasons absorbing it. He’s been in the quarterback room with Nix daily, breaking down film, running the scout team, and preparing as if his number might be called.

“There is no gray area with Sean,” Stidham said earlier this season. That’s precisely why he’s the right choice now. He understands what Payton wants before Payton says it.

Also, the free agent quarterbacks offer no viable alternative. Scan the list of unsigned quarterbacks, and the names make it clear that this isn’t the path Denver wants to go down.

Ryan Tannehill, 37, hasn’t taken an NFL snap since 2023. In November, he told reporters he believes “that chapter is closed.” Colin Kaepernick, 38, last played in 2016 and spent nearly nine years waiting for a call that never came. Jake Fromm, 27, was released by Detroit last April and remains unsigned. Taylor Heinicke, 32, was released by the Chargers in August and hasn’t found a roster since.

Some fans may immediately wonder about Tom Brady (even though he’s 48 years old), but his ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders prevents him from making another NFL comeback.

The rest of the free agent quarterback market is equally uninspiring. Tim Boyle signed with Tennessee last March, was waived in August after a disastrous preseason outing, and remains unsigned. Dorian Thompson-Robinson bounced from Cleveland to Philadelphia to the UFL’s Orlando Storm. Clayton Tune was cut by both Arizona and Green Bay this season. Bryce Perkins won UFL MVP last spring, got a brief Panthers audition in August, was waived within a week, and ended up in the Canadian Football League.

These aren’t hidden gems waiting for an opportunity. They’re players who couldn’t crack 53-man rosters across the league — some of them multiple times in the same calendar year.

Even if Denver could pluck a veteran off the street, that quarterback would face either the Patriots or Texans defense with roughly eight days of preparation in an offense built on pre-snap reads and option routes. The calculus doesn’t work.

Stidham’s track record isn’t extensive, but it exists. His first NFL start with the Raiders in 2022 produced 365 yards and three touchdowns against San Francisco. His two starts closing the 2023 season for Denver — after Russell Wilson was benched — yielded 496 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. He’s 1-3 as a starter, but that record includes games with nothing to play for on bad teams.

This is different. This roster went 14-3 and earned the AFC’s top seed. It’s also worth noting that he led the league in preseason passer rating last August.

Denver’s Defense Is the Actual Insurance Policy

The conversation around Nix’s injury has fixated on who throws the football. The more relevant question: Does it matter as much as everyone assumes?

Denver’s defense forced four turnovers against Josh Allen on Saturday night. Pat Surtain II has established himself as the league’s best cornerback. Nik Bonitto and the pass rush generated consistent pressure throughout the Bills game. Vance Joseph’s unit has carried this team through tight contests all season — the Broncos went 12-2 in one-score games, a mark that speaks to defensive reliability in crucial moments.

Stidham doesn’t need to be Bo Nix. He needs to protect the football, convert third downs at a reasonable clip, and let Wil Lutz stay busy. The Broncos beat Buffalo 33-30 in a game where Nix threw an interception and completed just 56.5% of his passes. The offense wasn’t dominant, the defense was.

Payton won Super Bowl XLIV with a game-managing Drew Brees performance: 32-of-39 passing, 288 yards, no turnovers. He understands how to win with a formula that doesn’t require the quarterback to be spectacular. The 2015 Broncos won Super Bowl 50 with a defense that suffocated opponents while Peyton Manning threw nine touchdowns and 17 interceptions during the regular season. Denver has the best defense in the league, according to PFSN’s Defense Impact metric.

Stidham’s job description is simple: Don’t lose the game. The defense can win it.

The Broncos re-signed Stidham to a two-year, $12 million deal last March specifically because Payton valued his preparation and system knowledge. This wasn’t a flyer on a cheap backup. Denver invested in continuity, betting that if Nix ever went down, they’d have someone who could step in without a learning curve.

Now, we’ll see if that bet pays off. Either way, the decision was made nine months ago. Signing someone off the street now would be an admission that the original plan failed, and it would almost certainly produce worse results than trusting the player they’ve developed.

“This team all year has lost key players and we’ll rise up for the next challenge,” Payton said Saturday. This isn’t just coach-speak. This is a deep roster with a system designed to function regardless of individual personnel.

The AFC Championship Game will be won or lost on whether Denver’s defense can replicate its performance against Allen, whether the offensive line can keep Stidham clean, and whether Courtland Sutton, Marvin Mims Jr., and Evan Engram can create separation. Stidham’s arm talent is adequate. His decision-making has been sound when given opportunities. His ceiling is lower than Nix’s, but his floor isn’t as far down as a random free agent operating from a playsheet of maybe 30 calls.

The Broncos aren’t looking for a savior. They have a backup quarterback, an elite defense, and a coach who has won a Super Bowl. That combination has worked before.",https://statico.profootballnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/17221948/top-free-agent-qbs-right-01-18-26-1024x714.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 11:59:26.296007

The 25-year-old sustained the injury on one of the final plays in overtime, head coach Sean Payton told reporters.

With Nix sidelined, Jarrett Stidham will start in the AFC Championship. It marks just the fifth start in Stidham’s career.

Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said Friday that they're ""really optimistic"" quarterback Sam Darnold is going to play in Saturday’s divisional-round playoff game versus the San Francisco 49ers, despite an oblique injury that came about in practice Thursday.

Darnold is still listed as ""questionable"" for the highly anticipated rematch between NFC West rivals. Backup Drew Lock has taken the reps this week to prepare should he be needed against the 49ers.

Rams guard Kevin Dotson did not have an injury designation after being a full participant in practice on Friday and head coach Sean McVay told reporters that the six-year veteran will start on Sunday night versus the Bears.

Dotson, 29, did not play in the Rams’ final two regular-season games and last weekend’s wild-card playoff matchup with the Panthers due to an ankle injury.

Chicago Bears wide receiver Rome Odunze is listed as “questionable” with a foot injury for Sunday’s divisional-round playoff game against the Los Angeles Rams.

Odunze caught two passes for 44 yards in a comeback, wild-card win over the Green Bay Packers last week.

In 12 regular-season games, he reeled in 44 passes for 661 yards and 6 touchdowns.

Notably, the Bears didn’t list injury designations for fellow WR DJ Moore, DB C.J. Gardner-Johnson and LT Braxton Jones.

Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold has been added to the injury report with an oblique issue that makes him “questionable” for Saturday’s divisional-round playoff game versus the San Francisco 49ers, but he told reporters Thursday that he still expects to play.

He was asked what percent of him thinks he might not play against the 49ers this weekend at Seattle's Lumen Field.

""Very low percentage,"" he said. ""Probably closer to zero.""

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen was listed as a full participant in practice on Thursday despite dealing with multiple injuries this week. The Bills will be looking to advance to their second consecutive AFC title game with a win in Denver on Saturday.

Gonzalez entered concussion protocol on Sunday night as the Patriots defeated the Chargers during wild-card weekend. He was a limited participant in Wednesday night’s practice and now the team gets a positive update with the corner shedding a red non-contact jersey as a full participant on Thursday.

Houston Texans wide receiver Nico Collins remains in concussion protocol and missed Thursday’s media session, according to the Houston Chronicle’s Jonathan Alexander.

Collins is unlikely to play in Sunday’s divisional round game against the New England Patriots because of the steps needed to clear concussion protocol.

Collins suffered the concussion in Monday’s wild-card 30-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers. Collins had 3 catches for 21 yards in the game before going down.

If Collins cannot go, expect Christian Kirk, Jayden Higgins, and Dalton Schultz to see an increase in targets. Jaylin Noel, Xavier Hutchinson and Cade Stover could also see an increased role.

OUT: S Jordan Poyer (hamstring), CB Maxwell Hairston (ankle)

Questionable: WR Curtis Samuel (elbow), S Damar Hamlin (pec), DT Ed Oliver (biceps)

A day later, Houston pummeled the Pittsburgh Steelers 30-6 despite quarterback C.J. Stroud's three turnovers. The Texans defense stepped up once again to keep them in contention in the AFC.

Houston managed that win despite missing top wide receiver Nico Collins for most of the game. He exited the game early in the second half after landing hard on his head attempting to catch a pass over the middle of the field.

He was subsequently put into the league's concussion protocol. Here's the latest on whether or not he'll play today against the Patriots:

Is Nico Collins playing today?

Collins will not take the field against the Patriots today. Houston ruled him out in their final injury report for the week. He's not the only wideout Houston will have to do without. Justin Watson is also out due to concussion protocol.

With Collins sidelined, Stroud will likely have to lean on veteran Christian Kirk - who had a breakout game against Pittsburgh - as well as rookie Jayden Higgins.

If Houston wins their first divisional playoff game in franchise history, Collins could be available for the AFC championship game. He could clear the concussion protocol in time for that.

What is the NFL's concussion protocol?

The NFL breaks its concussion protocol down into five distinct steps. The process is designed to break up the recovery process from a head injury, ensuring a player's safety.

Here are the five steps of the protocol, according to the NFL:

Symptom-limited activity

Aerobic exercise

Football-specific exercise

Club-based non-contact training drills

Here's everything you need to know about Stidham, including his stats, college and journey to the Broncos.

Where did Jarrett Stidham go to college?

Stidham initially played at Baylor, where he showed promise during his freshman season. After seeing time early in his college career, Stidham eventually took over as Baylor's starter after Seth Russell went down with an injury. Stidham finished his freshman year with 12 touchdowns against two interceptions in 10 games.

Stidham wasn't guaranteed the starting role the next season with Russell back. As a result, Stidham decided to transfer. After spending a semester at a community college, Stidham landed at Auburn. He started for the team as both a junior and senior, and combined to throw for 5,952 yards, 36 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in his two seasons with the team. Auburn went 10-4 and 8-5 in Stidham's two seasons as a starter.

Jarrett Stidham NFL Draft

Following two strong years at Auburn, Stidham heard his name called in the 2019 NFL Draft. The quarterback was selected by the New England Patriots in the fourth round and was the seventh quarterback off the board.

Given Stidham's status as a rookie and the fact that Patriots starter Tom Brady was about to enter his age-42 season, there were some who believed Stidham was drafted to be Brady's replacement once he left the team or retired.

Jarrett Stidham NFL stats

Being Brady's backup meant Stidham didn't see much time as a rookie. He appeared in three games, throwing just four passes in mop-up duty. One of those passes, however, was intercepted and returned for a touchdown.

Brady left the Patriots after the season, but Stidham was not named the team's starter. Instead, the Patriots signed Cam Newton, who started 15 games. Stidham spent portions of the 2020 NFL season as the team's third-string quarterback, behind veteran Brian Hoyer. While Stidham eventually worked his way up the depth chart and appeared in five games, he did not register a start in 2020.

The Patriots selected Mac Jones in the first round of the 2021 NFL Draft. Stidham missed time with an injury and did not appear in a game once he returned to action.

That offseason, Stidham was traded to the Las Vegas Raiders, reuniting with former Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who was hired as the Raiders' head coach that offseason. Stidham served as Derek Carr's backup, but was named the starter late in the season. He made his first two NFL starts, throwing four touchdowns against three interceptions in two losses.

Stidham left the Raiders in the offseason to join the Broncos on a two-year, $10 million deal. He served as a backup throughout most of the 2023 NFL season, though he started two games down the stretch after Russell Wilson was benched. Stidham threw two touchdowns and one interception in those games, going 1-1 to close out the season.

The Broncos selected Bo Nix in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft, pushing Stidham back into a reserve role. Since 2024, Stidham has appeared in just four games, though has not thrown a single pass.

Over his six-year NFL career, Stidham has appeared in 20 games, including four starts. He's completed 60.6 percent of his passes while throwing for 1,422 yards. Stidham has eight touchdowns against eight interceptions in the NFL.

His four NFL starts are the fewest of any player to start in the AFC championship game.

Stidham's AFC championship start will mark his first of the season. It's the first time since 1972 that a quarterback's first start of the year came in the AFC championship game.

Only six quarterbacks since 1950 have made their first start of the season in the playoffs. Only one of those players, former head coach Frank Reich, came away from his start with a win.

Jarrett Stidham career earnings

Stidham has made roughly $25 million since being drafted in 2019. His rookie deal with the Patriots totaled roughly $3 million over four seasons. Once he hit free agency in 2023, Stidham earned a two-year, $10 million deal from the Broncos.

That contract ran out last offseason, but the team brought Stidham back on another two-year deal. This one was worth $12 million. Stidham made just under $2 million in 2025 and is set to make close to $6 million in 2026.

Broncos QB depth chart

With Stidham set to take over, Sam Ehlinger is expected to serve as the team's backup quarterback behind Stidham. Ehlinger was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in the sixth round of the 2021 NFL Draft. He spent three years with the team before joining the Broncos on a one-year deal in 2025.

With that in mind, let's take a look at several wild options (Players are listed based on when they threw their last NFL pass).
Ryan Tannehill Age: 37 Last NFL pass: 2023 season As crazy as it sounds, this might actually be Denver's most intriguing option.
Remember, this is just a one week commitment, and if you happen to win the AFC title game, then it turns into a three-week commitment.
Back in 2012, his Falcons blew a 17-0 lead to the 49ers in the NFC title game.","The Denver Broncos are headed to the AFC Championship game for the first time in 10 years after beating the Bills on Saturday, but right now, they aren't exactly celebrating and that's because they don't really have a quarterback. Following Denver's 33-30 victory over the Bills on Saturday, Sean Payton announced that Bo Nix would be out for the rest of the season after fracturing a bone in his ankle.

With Nix out, the Broncos will be turning the starting QB job over to Jarrett Stidham, but Payton can't be feeling very comfortable about that, especially when you consider that Stidham hasn't thrown a regular-season pass in two years! If you're scoring at home, Stidham's last NFL pass came on Jan. 7, 2024, which means he'll have gone 749 days without throwing an NFL pass by the time the AFC title game rolls around. Sam Ehlinger is the only other quarterback on the Broncos' roster, so as things currently stand now, he would be Stidham's backup. Ehlinger, a sixth-round pick out of Texas in 2021, is 0-3 in three career starts; Stidham is 1-3 in four career starts.

The Broncos are in a desperate situation and desperate teams do desperate things. Earlier this year, we saw the Colts sign 44-year-old Philip Rivers in hopes of saving their season after Daniel Jones went down with an injury. The Broncos could go a similar route and it would actually make some sense for them to do that. Unlike the Colts' situation, the Broncos don't need a QB who can play half the season, they just need a guy who's willing to make a three-week commitment -- at the most.

The new QB would only have to practice one week and play in one game (the AFC title game) and if Denver somehow won that, then the QB would have two more weeks of practice and one more game (Super Bowl LX). If you really think about it, it's an enticing offer that would potentially give a retired quarterback a serious shot at a Lombardi Trophy.

With that in mind, let's take a look at several wild options (Players are listed based on when they threw their last NFL pass).

Ryan Tannehill

Age: 37

Last NFL pass: 2023 season

As crazy as it sounds, this might actually be Denver's most intriguing option. Tannehill hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since Week 18 of the 2023 season, which sounds like a long time ago, but his last pass actually came on the same day that Stidham threw his last regular-season pass. The best part for the Broncos is that Tannehill does have some playoff experience: He led the Titans to the AFC title game in 2019 and then one year later, he helped lead Tennessee to the No. 1 overall seed in the AFC.

Tannehill was coached in Tennessee by Mike Vrabel, who might end up being Denver's opponent this year if his Patriots can beat the Texans on Sunday. Tannehill also has some mobility, which is something Payton would probably prefer to have.

Back in November, Tannehill said he probably wouldn't be returning to the NFL, but it's certainly possible that he would change his mind if the Broncos called.

""I think that chapter is closed,"" Tannehill said when asked if his career was over, via The Escapist. ""I think last year, that was where I was at, if the right opportunity came up and was right for our family. Staying in shape and staying ready. I had plenty of calls, but nothing ever felt like the right opportunity that I was looking for. That was last NFL season. At this point, I think that ship has sailed for me.""

Matt Ryan

Age: 40

Last NFL pass: 2022 season

Ryan just got a new job last week as the Falcons' new president of football, so it's unlikely that he would want to step away so soon, but this would give him a chance to finally win that elusive Lombardi Trophy, which might be enough to woo him away for a week or two. Remember, this is just a one week commitment, and if you happen to win the AFC title game, then it turns into a three-week commitment.

Ryan has been part of some of the most painful postseason losses in NFL history. Back in 2012, his Falcons blew a 17-0 lead to the 49ers in the NFC title game. In 2016, he finally got to the Super Bowl only to watch his team blow a 28-3 lead to the Patriots. The Broncos could end up facing the Patriots in the AFC title game, and if that happens, maybe Payton is able to sell Ryan on a possible return to get some revenge.

During his introductory press conference at his new job, Ryan actually joked about making a possible comeback.

""I'm not trying to call plays. I'm not trying to run your offense. I'm not trying to pull a Philip Rivers and come back and play,"" Ryan said.

But what if there's a chance to win a Super Bowl?

Cam Newton

Age: 36

Last NFL pass: 2021 season

Newton hasn't played since 2021, but he's still only 36 years old and the interesting part is that he hasn't officially retired. After the Colts signed Rivers in December, Newton was asked on his podcast if he'd ever be willing to return to the NFL after four years out of the league.

""I'm open for business, but I want to be [with] who really want me,"" Newton said.

Basically, Newton will be more than happy to answer the phone if Payton calls. Newton, who was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, spent 10 of his 11 seasons with the Carolina Panthers. Newton also started 16 games against Payton's Saints, so the Broncos coach is certainly familiar with his work.

Newton was voted MVP in 2015, a season where he ended up leading the 15-1 Panthers to the Super Bowl. And in a crazy twist, the Panthers played the Broncos in the Super Bowl that year in a game that was played at Levi's Stadium. Newton could potentially return with the Broncos to play a Super Bowl in the same stadium 10 years later.

Drew Brees

Age: 47

Last NFL pass: 2020 season

if there's one name that Payton might toss around this week, it's Brees. The Broncos head coach spent 15 seasons in New Orleans with Brees as his quarterback, a time span that included three conference title game appearances and a Super Bowl win in 2009.

The only problem with calling Brees is that, apparently, his right arm isn't working anymore.

""Honestly, man, if my right arm was still working, I probably would've played another three years,"" Brees said back in May 2024. ""My body feels great. My body can play. My right arm can't. Unfortunately that's what kind of forced me to step away. And it was time too.""

Brees' right arm definitely couldn't handle the rigors of an entire NFL season, but could it work for three weeks or even just one game? At age 47, Brees might not be interested, but it might be worth it for Payton to make a call just to check in on his former quarterback.

Andrew Luck

Age: 36

Last NFL pass: 2018

The former Colts quarterback shocked the NFL when he decided to retire back in August 2019, and right now, he doesn't seem too interested in a comeback. Before signing Rivers in December, the Colts didn't call Luck, but if they would have, he knew what his answer was going to be.

""No, thank you. I'm right where I'm supposed to be,"" Luck told Jim Rome in December.

Luck is currently the general manager of Stanford football, and although he might not be interested in returning, Sean Payton could do his best to convince him that this is essentially a one-game deal. When you've been retired for nearly eight years, you likely don't want to take the beating that comes with playing an NFL season (or even a half season), but this is just one game, and possibly two, if the Broncos were to win the AFC title game.

Also, let's not forget, the most famous QB in Broncos' history (John Elway) went to Stanford. The current CEO and co-owner of the Broncos (Greg Penner) also has a Stanford degree. Those two could call up Luck and try to make him an offer that he couldn't refuse, you know, like maybe writing a huge check to the Stanford athletic department.

Colin Kaepernick

Age: 38

Last NFL pass: 2016

The only reason Kaepernick is on this list is because he's the one of the rare older guys who actually wants to return. As recently as August 2024, Kaepernick said he was staying in shape in hopes of getting a call from an NFL team.

""We're still training, we're still pushing, we just gotta get one of these team owners to open up,"" Kaepernick told SkyNews at the time. ""I could bring a lot to a team and help them win a championship.""

One thing Kaepernick would bring to the table is big game experience. During his six-year career with the 49ers, he led them to two NFC title games and one Super Bowl. Kaepernick currently holds the NFL record for most rushing yards by a QB in a playoff game with 181. At 38, he's likely lost a step or two, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

Free agent quarterbacks: Taylor Heinicke, Jake Fromm, C.J. Beathard. If Payton was interested in one of these guys, he could have called them during the season.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2026/01/18/bb2755ea-7a0a-47c2-a190-c18c9bf40014/thumbnail/1200x675/170e806c9d836d485d12fa36f3b23114/drewbreessaints.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 11:02:39.869978

Sam Darnold, who struggled with an oblique injury in the lead-up to the game, threw for 127 yards, no interceptions and a touchdown to help the Seahawks claim a resounding 41-6 victory.

While Darnold's presence was a major boost, it was star running back Kenneth Walker III who stole the show on the night for Seattle after registering 19 carries for 116 rushing yards and three touchdowns.

Walker also had three catches for 29 yards on the night, while wide receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba was on hand with as many receptions for 19 yards and a touchdown.

The win means Seattle will take on the winner of Sunday's other NFC Divisional clash between the Los Angeles Rams and the Chicago Bears for a place in the Super Bowl next weekend.

The Seahawks led 7-0 just 13 seconds into Saturday's game thanks to Rashid Shaheed, who returned the opening kickoff for a 95-yard touchdown. It was the fourth kickoff return for a touchdown to open a playoff game since 2000 and the longest postseason kick return in franchise history.

After being listed as questionable for the game, Darnold guided the Seahawks on two more scoring drives before San Francisco got on the board with the first of its two field goals.

The 49ers (13-6) were never competitive in the second-most lopsided playoff loss in franchise history. San Francisco lost 49-3 to the New York Giants in the divisional round in the 1986 season.

They were missing three injured All-Pros on the night: tight end George Kittle, linebacker Fred Warner and defensive end Nick Bosa. Christian McCaffrey was also injured in the second quarter and briefly returned in the third before exiting for good.

Brock Purdy completed 15 of 27 passes for 140 yards with an interception and a lost fumble against the Seahawks' 'Dark Side' defense. Seattle also recovered a fumble by tight end Jake Tonges.

""… He was consistent, he was the same Sam that he's always been, leading the huddle, being a steady leading force for us. And he made some unbelievable throws—the one rolling out to the left that he threw to Jax in the end zone, those are unbelievable throws that he was making today.""

""I figured he was going to find a way to get out there,"" Kupp said. ""You don't know without him throwing or anything, but he was out there at the walkthrough on (Friday), he was told not to throw, and he was out there pump-faking, and everyone's like, 'Dude, just stop. Please don't do anything stupid.' So I figured with him pump-faking as much as he was, he had to be feeling OK.""

""Obviously I didn't go out for the non-padded warm-up,"" he said. ""I think that kind of stirred some questions, which was funny. I got to throw in here, and did the same thing, did my routine in here. Once I put the pads on and got that padded warm-up, I wanted to be rolling. I didn't want to waste any time getting warm on the field and coming in, having 40 minutes to get warm again and then go back out. I just wanted to get warm once and then go back out there in the pads. So that was why I did it that way.""

""It's huge,"" he said. ""I don't take it for granted whatsoever. It's just a special group. I think that's the biggest thing, and that's why it means so much. Just the way those guys are in the locker room, ever since I got here. They were tight before I got here, obviously, but just the way that they took me in as one of their own. And that's what's so special about this league in general. You make so many great relationships throughout this whole process. And that locker room and these coaches, you know, just the way that we play together. That's the reason why I play this game, and they've made it really easy for me to come in here ever since I did in April to be able to help lead this team and drive the ball down the field, score touchdowns, all those things.""

While Darnold came up with some big throws, including the aforementioned throws to Kupp and Smith-Njigba in the first quarter, as well as a 16-yarder to Jake Bobo on third-and-10 to extend another drive that ended with a touchdown, he did not have to throw the ball a ton thanks to a dominant defensive effort and another big rushing performance. But when Darnold did throw, he was efficient, completing 12 of 17 attempts for 124 yards and a touchdown, giving him a 110.9 passer rating, and for the second game in a row, the Seahawks did not commit a turnover.

""Tremendous, tremendous,"" Macdonald said of Darnold's performance. ""Couple of plays early that I think to get in the swing of things. But I say 'manage' the game as a very high-powered compliment. Just throwing it on time, taking care of the ball, making the plays when we need to. I think there's going to be some explosives out there that maybe we could get to. But, shoot, I thought there's a lot of operation stuff that he did that really helped us as well.""

And even if there was some initial concern outside of the organization on Thursday when Darnold popped up on the injury report, then again on Saturday when Darnold wasn't out for pregame warmups, his teammates had no doubt not only that they'd have their quarterback, but that he would come through with a winning performance.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/uvryoflvyxekxeziwccj,N,,2026-01-18 11:02:48.535038

Could young quarterback Bo Nix deliver in a big game when his team needed him most?

Nix did, and the Broncos are on their way to the AFC Championship Game after knocking off the Bills 33-30 in overtime.

After a strong start to the game saw the young quarterback throw a pair of first-half touchdowns to take a 20-10 lead to the locker room, Nix and the Broncos were trailing by four, 27-23, late in the fourth quarter. This was the moment the NFL world had wondered about for weeks as the playoffs approached. Could the young passer step up? Could Nix silence the doubters at a moment like this, and prove he was the QB Denver needed him to be?

He delivered.

The drive began with Nix throwing a dime along the right sideline, after avoiding pressure from Joey Bosa, climbing the pocket, and connecting with Courtland Sutton along the right sideline:

As noted, it was Sutton’s first catch of the game.

Shortly thereafter, he made his second. After two plays moved the Broncos backward, Denver faced 3rd and 11 on their own 39-yard line with 3:19 left in the game. This was a pivotal moment in the contest, and for Nix.

That is when the QB ripped an absolute rocket on this dig route to Sutton:

Following an injury timeout for center Alex Forsyth, Nix and Sean Payton let the clock run down to the two-minute warning, setting Denver up for a 1st and 10 at the Buffalo 38-yard line.

A few snaps later Denver faced another third down, and once more Nix moved the chains.

Only this time, he did it with his legs:

Denver stopped the clock with just 61 seconds remaining after the run, setting the Broncos up with a 1st-and-10 situation at the Buffalo 26-yard line.

That’s when Nix dropped in a dime to Marvin Mims Jr. to give Denver the lead, with a beautiful throw:

Mims stayed down on the ground for a long time, as he slid into a camera after making the over-the-shoulder catch. It was also a brilliant call from Payton, who dialed up a double-move route for Mims working against backup cornerback Dane Jackson, who had just come into the game for that play due to an injury.

Nix was 6-of-7 on the drive, including two critical third-down conversions, just when Denver needed him most.

Josh Allen had some magic up his sleeves of course, as the Bills forced overtime with a field goal in the closing seconds of regulation. But in overtime, the Broncos punched their ticket to the AFC Championship Game.

The big play in OT was the controversial interception by Broncos defender Ja’Quan McMillan, which ended Buffalo’s first possession — after the Bills had forced a Denver punt — and gave the Broncos another chance. Nix connected with R.J. Harvey on this short throw to get the Broncos offense moving:

Then came a string of penalties on Buffalo, including at least one rather questionable pass interference penalty, that put the Broncos into position for the game-winning field goal. But that field goal would not have been possible without what Nix did on Denver’s final drive of regulation.

Of course, there is a painful subplot to this story, literally and figuratively.

Nix’s season ended tonight as the young quarterback suffered a fracture in his right ankle on Denver’s final drive in overtime. The Broncos are moving on, but they will take the field in the AFC Championship Game with Jarrett Stidham at the helm, and not Nix.

But what Nix did tonight before that injury was exactly what Broncos fans, and the rest of the NFL world were waiting to see. Which is Nix living up to the moment, when his team needed him most.

The No. 6-seeded San Francisco 49ers fell in crushing fashion, 41-6, to the top-seeded Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Divisional Playoffs on Saturday at Lumen Field.

The Seahawks won the 2025 rubber match against their longtime NFC West rivals after they ended the regular season tied 1-1, and Seattle now advances to its first NFC Championship Game appearance since 2014.

Nix broke his right ankle late in overtime of the Broncos's divisional-round victory over Buffalo and will have surgery that will sideline him for the rest of the play-offs.

Coach Sean Payton delivered the stunning news about his second-year quarterback in the aftermath of Denver's biggest win in a decade.

Backup Jarrett Stidham, who's 1-3 as a starter in six seasons, will start the AFC championship game against either Houston or New England next weekend.

""Stiddy's ready,"" Payton said after returning to the post-game lectern to discuss the injury following Denver's 33-30 victory over Josh Allen and the Bills.

Payton said Nix got hurt on a keeper where he lost 2 yards and was tackled by safety Cole Bishop. Nix was limping after the play, but there was no indication that he suffered such a serious injury.

On the next play, Nix threw a deep pass to Marvin Mims Jr. that drew a 30-yard pass-interference flag and got the Broncos well into field-goal range. Nix then took a knee to centre the ball for Wil Lutz's game-ending 23-yard field goal.

The defeat was a heartbreaker for Buffalo, whose post-season woes continue.

Despite boasting reigning MVP Josh Allen, the Bills have yet to make a Super Bowl since 1994.

Allen, who threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns but also had four turnovers via two interceptions and two fumbles, was in tears after the match.

""It's extremely difficult,"" Allen said.

""I feel like I let my teammates down tonight. There were missed opportunities throughout the game. I hate how it ended. It's going to stick with me for a long time.""

Denver qualified as the top seed in the AFC and would have been warmly favoured to progress past next week if Nix were fit.

The Patriots and Texans, who play on Monday morning AEST, now have a real shot at a saloon passage to Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara.

Meanwhile, title favourites Seattle put an end to San Francisco's season with a comprehensive 41-6 drubbing.

Quarterback Sam Darnold carried a side injury into the match but the Seahawks did not skip a beat, scoring from the opening kick-off through Rashin Shaheed and dominating the injury-hit 49ers from pillar to post.

Running back Kenneth Walker finished with three touchdowns and 116 yards as Mike Macdonald's side dominated.

But he had three regular-season starts to get prepared for the playoffs after Carson Wentz went down.

Jeff Hostetler got two regular-season starts for the 1990 New York Giants after Phil Simms suffered a season-ending injury, and that got him ready to lead the Giants to a Super Bowl XXV win.

Kurt Warner took over for Trent Green and led the 1999 Rams to a title, but he was the starter all season.

What the Denver Broncos are about to embark upon is tough to draw a reasonable comparison to. Long after the Broncos’ fantastic 33-30 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills in the AFC’s divisional round, Broncos head coach Sean Payton returned to the media room, which is highly unusual. He announced that on the second-to-last play of the game, his quarterback Bo Nix suffered a broken bone in his right ankle and is done for the rest of the season.

“They’ll be disappointed,” Payton said. “There will be a lot of emotions. Then the refocus takes place.”

Once the shock wore off, the question became: What does this mean for the Broncos as they get ready for the AFC championship game?

How does Bo Nix’s injury affect Broncos?

For starters, the injury shifted Super Bowl odds as the Broncos went from +325 to +900, according to BetMGM.

The Broncos don’t have time to worry about that. They have an AFC title game eight days after Nix’s injury. They’ll face either the Houston Texans or New England Patriots, and do so with Jarrett Stidham starting at quarterback. Stidham has some familiarity with the Patriots, having spent his first two seasons in 2019 and 2020 with them.

Stidham has not thrown a pass in either of the last two seasons. He has four starts in his NFL career, two with the Raiders in 2022 and two more with the Broncos in 2023. His teams went 1-3 in those games.

Payton has been high on Stidham, who is on his second contract with the Broncos. His first, signed in 2023, was for $10 million. The one he signed before this season was for $12 million. That’s good money for a backup, even though the Broncos haven’t had to use him.

[Get more Broncos news: Denver team feed]

Like Dick Vermeil, the Rams head coach who promised in 1999 after Green’s injury that “We will rally around Kurt Warner, and we will play good football,” Payton was confident and even a bit defiant about having to turn to Stidham.

Advertisement

“He’s ready,” Payton said. “I said this before the season, I feel like I’ve got a two that is capable of starting for a number of teams. Watch out. Just watch.”

The numbers don’t look that great. In 197 career NFL passes, Stidham has 1,422 yards, 8 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. That’s a passer rating of 78.3, which would get most NFL starters benched. But it’s not like the Broncos have much choice.

The good news is they revolve around a very good defense that finished third in the NFL in points allowed and second in yards allowed during the regular season. The Broncos will have to run it effectively on offense, and they were a middle-of-the-road running team during the season (16th in yards, 15th in yards per attempt).

And they’ll need Stidham to do his job when called upon. Stidham isn’t the runner that Nix is (just 101 yards on 37 attempts), so Payton will have to change the way he calls an offense. He, and Stidham, have a week to prepare for that.

“He’s experienced,” Payton said. “He has played in games. They’re different type players to some degree, and yet, they’re very close friends, as with Sam [Ehlinger, the Broncos’ quarterback behind Stidham]. It’s a tight room. Sam will be our two, and here we go.”

Stidham’s first NFL pass since Jan. 7, 2024 will come in a game with a Super Bowl trip on the line. The Broncos have a challenge ahead.

Big edge for Broncos’ AFC opponent

The Nix injury changes the landscape of the rest of the playoffs. Whoever wins between the Texans and Patriots will be expected to win again against a team with a seldom-used backup quarterback.

It’s never that easy in the NFL. Payton has confidence in Stidham for a reason. The Broncos aren’t reliant on their quarterback to win games, either. The Texans or Patriots will still be facing one of the NFL’s best defenses in Denver, which is tough to play at due to the high altitude. But it’s clearly an edge for the winner of Sunday’s Texans-Patriots game. And, if the Broncos advance to Super Bowl LX despite not having Nix, it will be an edge for the NFC champion there, whether it be the Seattle Seahawks, Los Angeles Rams or Chicago Bears.

One of the four teams that will be playing next weekend just lost its starting quarterback suddenly. That has an obvious effect on everyone else still vying for a title.

There is also a question about Nix for next season, though he has rebounded from a broken ankle before. Payton said that Nix had the injury in high school, and he broke his ankle during the 2021 season as well when he was at Auburn.

“I said, ‘I didn’t realize that. If I would have known that I wouldn’t have drafted you,’” Payton said, making a joke in a discouraging moment for the Broncos. “He’s a tough cookie.”

Nix returned in 2022 at Oregon after the ankle injury and threw for 3,593 yards and 25 touchdowns.

Teams deal with injuries all the time. Rarely is it a season-ending injury to a quarterback right before a conference championship game. The Broncos will be ready. And if they can overcome Nix’s injury, it will be quite a story.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RK5I0qojVgekjSbE_T81qQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04Mjk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2026-01/72dcc98b-6a5b-408c-88cd-fb957ddabb6d,N,,2026-01-18 06:58:47.871087

After a chaotic Wild Card Weekend, the divisional round has carried the baton and continued the madness as we inch closer to Super Bowl LX in Santa Clara, California.

Right out of the gate, we were treated to an instant classic between the Denver Broncos and Buffalo Bills, which needed overtime to determine a winner. While Denver was able to outlast Buffalo and send Josh Allen packing, the victory came at a tremendous cost as quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season-ending ankle injury during overtime. In the later game on Saturday, the Seahawks defense flexed its defensive dominance, keeping the 49ers out of the end zone in a 41-6 thumping.

There's never a dull moment in the NFL, and the storylines are continuing to pour out of these playoff showdowns. But what are we to make of them all? Below, we'll navigate the noise and determine which takeaways from Saturday's matchups are reality and which are mere overreactions.

Broncos' Super Bowl hopes are done after Bo Nix's injury

Overreaction or reality: Reality

After the high of seeing Will Lutz's game-winning field goal secure Denver's place in the AFC Championship, the Broncos hit the lowest of lows in the moments after the overtime victory. Sean Payton announced that Bo Nix suffered a broken bone in his ankle that will require surgery and end his season. The Broncos say that Nix suffered the injury on the second-to-last play of overtime.

Payton told reporters postgame that Jarrett Stidham will get the start in the AFC Championship next week, which will be held in Denver at Mile High. While the Broncos will have home-field advantage and boast one of the best defenses in the NFL, this injury effectively ends any dreams of hoisting a Lombardi Trophy.

Stidham has been with the Broncos since 2023, so he's familiar with Payton's offense, but being thrust into a conference championship is too tall a task. The 29-year-old played one snap this season, taking a knee in October. He hasn't thrown a regular-season pass since 2023. No matter if it's the Houston Texans or New England Patriots who advance to meet them in the AFC Championship, it's hard to imagine a scenario where Stidham helps orchestrate a victory outside of the defense pitching a shutout.

Josh Allen fumbles best chance at winning Super Bowl

Overreaction or reality: Reality

Josh Allen and the Buffalo Bills have squandered what will likely be their best opportunity to make and win a Super Bowl. It goes beyond just losing to the Denver Broncos in the divisional round. Buffalo entered the 2025 season as the biggest favorite to win its division, but let go of the rope and saw the Patriots leapfrog them. That forced Allen and Co. to enter the postseason as a wild-card entry and go on the road, creating an even more difficult path.

Of course, this was also a postseason that did not include Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow, or Lamar Jackson, three quarterbacks who have been major roadblocks to the Bills in years past. It's hard to imagine that trio not being in the playoffs over the next few years, adding even more hurdles to what is an increasingly competitive conference.

It's fair to wonder if the window has closed for Buffalo before they could even break through.

Josh Allen is solely responsible for the loss to Denver

Overreaction or reality: Overreaction

Don't get us wrong, Josh Allen is a main culprit as to why Buffalo's season is over. The defending NFL MVP didn't look the part in the loss to Denver, committing four turnovers (two fumbles and two interceptions). His back-to-back fumbles sandwiched in between halftime were egregious, and he seemed to force the ball down the field on his two interceptions, including the pick in overtime that helped set up Denver's game-winning drive.

However, the loss doesn't fall entirely on Allen's shoulders. There's a big-picture problem in Buffalo, as the organization failed to surround its franchise cornerstone with the talent to get over the edge. Allen's two interceptions were on passes to wideouts Brandin Cooks and Curtis Samuel. Cooks arrived as a free-agent signing in late November, while Samuel was activated off of IR just before this contest. That shows just how thin the Bills were at receiver, and it's worth pointing out that lack of firepower in a shootout loss like this.

Throughout the season, it felt like Buffalo was leaning too much on Allen to simply throw on the Superman cape and will them to victory, rather than giving him the tools (weapons) to put them in the best position to succeed. It made him press in this game and burned a golden opportunity at a championship.

Sean McDermott is on the hot seat

Overreaction or reality: Reality

It's a little late in the head coach hiring process with John Harbaugh (Giants) and Kevin Stefanski (Falcons) already being hired, so Sean McDermott's job could be safe for 2026. However, the Bills head coach is likely going to be sitting on one of the hottest seats in the NFL next season, and if Buffalo doesn't meet expectations again, changes could be on the horizon.

McDermott has the second-most wins (98) by a head coach to never make a Super Bowl appearance since 2000. He also has the most playoff wins (8) without a Super Bowl appearance by a head coach all-time.

While this is certainly productive to constantly being in the hunt, it's not maximizing what Buffalo has in Josh Allen during his prime years, which could make the Bills brass consider a change.

Seahawks don't need Sam Darnold to win

Overreaction or reality: Overreaction

The major story coming into this divisional round matchup was the status of Sam Darnold, who suffered an oblique injury during the week, which left him questionable. Darnold ultimately suited up and started, but he dropped back to pass just 17 times in the blowout win over San Francisco. While Darnold was efficient with those opportunities (12 completions for 124 yards and a touchdown), Seattle didn't ask him to do too much. The defense did most of the heavy lifting, suffocating the Niners to the tune of just six points scored. Meanwhile, Kenneth Walker III carried the load offensively with 19 carries for 116 yards and three touchdowns, while adding three catches for 29 yards receiving.

Frankly, the Seahawks didn't need Darnold for this game to win. However, that doesn't mean they won't need him in the NFC Championship or, potentially, Super Bowl LX. As good as this defense has played for Seattle, they're going to call on Darnold to make plays at some point over these next few weeks, so getting him to full health will be imperative.

It would have been fun to see what Sean Payton and this Broncos team could have done.","The NFL divisional round began with an incredible game in Denver on Saturday. The Bills and Broncos went to overtime, but the Broncos emerged on top after hitting a 23-yard field goal to win it in the extra frame. However, it came at a cost; Bo Nix went down with an ankle injury. The second game was more one-sided, as the Seahawks blew out the 49ers on Saturday night. Two more games are on deck, with Texans-Patriots and Rams-Bears on Sunday.

What are the main lessons and takeaways from each divisional round matchup, and what's next for these teams? We asked national NFL reporter Dan Graziano and NFL analyst Ben Solak to help size up every matchup from the second round and look forward from all angles. For each divisional round game, Solak is answering one big remaining question and Graziano is judging the legitimacy of one potential overreaction.

Let's jump in, making sense of the Seahawks' great roster, the 49ers' decimated roster, the Nix injury news and the Bills' playoff woes. And we will continue to react to games as they happen over the course of the weekend.

SF-SEA | BUF-DEN

Seahawks 41, 49ers 6

'The Seahawks had the best offseason of any team.' Overreaction?

No, not an overreaction. The Seahawks went into the 2025 offseason intent on and expecting to sign Geno Smith to a contract extension. When it became apparent to them that Smith wasn't interested in extending his deal at their numbers, they traded him to the Raiders and signed Sam Darnold. Say what you will about Darnold, but the 2025 Seahawks went 14-3 -- same record as Darnold's 2024 Vikings -- and now he has a home game Jan. 25 in the NFC Championship Game.

Seahawks GM John Schneider went about his offseason the same way he would have had he landed his first choice at quarterback. He signed DeMarcus Lawrence. He signed Cooper Kupp because he's a better blocker at this point than Tyler Lockett. He drafted Nick Emmanwori in the second round. Schneider freaking loves the second round. Even as someone who likes to see players get as much money as they can and wishes the top QBs would push harder to move the market upward for others, I still have to appreciate a philosophy like Seattle's approach: ""Do we have to pay our quarterback $50-plus million per year if he still hasn't shown he's that guy?""

A Seahawks employee told me after the team's wild Week 16 victory over the Rams, ""We're trying to win championships here,"" and the Seahawks obviously are living that. Seattle has lost three games all season, and the margins were four, three and two points. Two of those losses were to division rivals, one of which they eliminated Saturday. Is Darnold the second coming of Joe Montana? No. Of John Elway? No. Of Patrick Mahomes? No. But the Seahawks decided, at some point, that they intend to be the example of how to win a championship without paying great quarterback money to a pretty good quarterback because there's a championship-caliber roster around him.

Kudos to the Seahawks for treating the QB portion of their offseason the way they would have treated any other portion of it. They didn't get the player they wanted, but they knew they could still win with this quarterback because of everything else they do well. Hiring Mike Macdonald as head coach was a last offseason move, not a this offseason move, but it was still one that impacted their approach to this offseason. And here they still are. -- Graziano

The lingering question: Will the 49ers be NFC favorites with a healthy team next season?

It's too early to say, of course. But spin it forward for me. The Seahawks will likely be the favorite, barring some catastrophic injury between now and then. The Rams could be up there, as well, especially if they finish the NFC playoffs strong ... but Matthew Stafford's career longevity is always going to be a question that hurts them in the futures markets. Meanwhile, the 49ers still have most of their main players under contract.

Trent Williams' contract is expiring, and the offensive line clearly needs help across the board. Wide receiver is a little thin with the Brandon Aiyuk situation unclear and Jauan Jennings approaching free agency. But that young defense, which was hammered by injuries this season, will return Nick Bosa and Fred Warner. And Yetur Gross-Matos and Jordan Elliott are the only two expiring contracts there. This group will benefit from postseason experience next season and will presumably add to the pass rush.

Of course, the 49ers will see if they get through the offseason without losing defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, who was key to their surprising success despite all the injuries. Saleh has interviewed with the Titans and Ravens already and is a deservedly hot name on the head coaching circuit. If he gets a job, San Francisco will be forced back on the defensive coordinator carousel.

It's also worth noting that the 49ers, who had a very easy schedule entering this season, will play a third-place schedule next season despite their postseason appearance. With only a few moves in offseason housekeeping and a regression to the mean in injury luck, the Niners should be considered a deep NFC playoff team once again. -- Solak

Broncos 33, Bills 30

'The Broncos are done without Bo Nix.' Overreaction?

No, not an overreaction. The Broncos barely won Saturday's game. Buffalo had to turn the ball over five times -- including once in overtime -- or else Nix might not have broken his ankle in the first place. And certainly, without Nix's clutch play in the fourth quarter and overtime, Denver wouldn't have won and advanced to a home AFC Championship Game.

But now? You want me to believe the Broncos are going to beat Houston or New England with Jarrett Stidham at quarterback? And even if they do, does anyone believe they can then win the Super Bowl? I'm sorry, Jarrett, but it just doesn't feel to me like this Broncos team is good enough to pull a 2017 Eagles and win this thing without their starting quarterback.

The Broncos have a good defense, yes. We know this about them. But they weren't super awesome Saturday against a Bills team that moved the ball extremely well between turnovers, and they haven't been elite in the way that defenses such as Seattle and Houston have been -- at least not over the second half of this season. The Broncos do run the ball better than most think, but c'mon. We all watched this game. The Bills handed the Broncos 10 points at the tail end of the first half, then three more at the start of the second, and Buffalo still had a fourth-quarter lead that Nix found a way to overcome. Nix isn't a perfect player, but what he can do with his legs and what he can do in the clutch are separating factors that Stidham just doesn't offer.

The Broncos defense is going to have to play the game of a lifetime next week -- even if it's against Houston's inconsistent offense -- if it wants to lug this team into the Super Bowl. And even if it collects a bunch of turnovers and sneaks into the big game, Denver is then going to have to beat a team that has had two weeks off and likely still has its starting quarterback.

It's a shame. It would have been fun to see what Sean Payton and this Broncos team could have done. Payton could have been the first coach to win the Super Bowl with two different teams. But in the wake of the Nix injury news, all of that is a lot harder to imagine. -- Graziano

The lingering question: Why do the Bills keep losing in the postseason?

I have no idea. What is there to say? The Bills turned the football over five times, and no team that turns the ball over five times deserves to be in the game at all. Josh Allen's end-of-half fumble to let the Broncos go up 20-10 was an inexcusable mistake. He was stripped to start the second half to give Denver an even bigger lead. He threw a pick immediately off a key defensive takeaway.

It felt like Allen was digging the hole, and then as always, Allen was the one to pull the Bills back out. But there were too many misses. Allen failed to connect with Khalil Shakir on a third-and-8 screen in the red zone that could have allowed him to score, and he missed an open Dawson Knox at the end of regulation on a throw that could have walked the game off. Allen was simultaneously one of the biggest reasons the Bills were still in that game, while also being one of the biggest reasons they fell short.

The Bills have now made it to seven consecutive postseasons with Allen at the helm, which means they've suffered seven postseason losses. There's really no unifying factor on the field, though. Wide receiver talent was a big deal in this game; Allen was 0-for-9 throwing 20-plus yards downfield, and downfield production is often a receiver stat. The pass rush has been an issue and was again in this game; Nix was pressured on 20% of his dropbacks, and the Bills needed to send blitzes to get home. Defensive back depth was also a big deal; two of Nix's three touchdowns came targeting backup defensive backs.

Still, when you've lost seven playoff games, there are some obvious unifying factors -- coach Sean McDermott, GM Brandon Beane and Allen. The Bills' triumvirate has been in place for the better part of a decade and has yet to get over the hump. Whether fair or unfair, the buck stops at the top, and the fact that the Bills have failed to make a Super Bowl in Allen's tenure despite seven postseason appearances is an enormous failure.

If the Bills make changes, I'd totally get it. If they don't, I'd totally get it, too. They've been so close so many times. What a devastating loss. -- Solak",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0118%2Fr1602071_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 06:59:33.526086

If the second-to-last play of the game is truly what Payton was referencing, then it would be the play in which the Broncos simply took a knee prior to kicking the game-winning field goal. The play right before that, Nix threw an incompletion that resulted in a 30-yard pass interference call on Buffalo, which set up the Broncos in field-goal range.

The play before that, Nix ran a keeper where he lost two yards and was tackled by safety Cole Bishop. Nix was seen limping slightly after the play.

Nix was 26-of-46 for 279 yards and three touchdowns while also rushing for 29 yards on 12 carries in the win.

""He’s such a strong, faith-based guy,"" Payton said. ""He’s sitting in the hallway with his family and coming over and we’re all talking to him. He knows that God’s got a plan for him and he said he had (a broken ankle) in high school and then he said he had one at Auburn.

""And I said I didn’t realize that. I said if I had known that I wouldn’t have drafted you.""

Nix, the 12th overall pick out of Oregon in the 2024 NFL draft, tied Russell Wilson’s NFL record with two dozen victories in his first two seasons. Saturday’s victory was his first in the playoffs. The Broncos lost last year at Buffalo, but Nix led Denver to the AFC’s top seed this season.

""He’s a tough cookie,"" Payton said. ""And this team all year has lost key players and will rise up for the next challenge.""

Payton said Broncos backup Jarrett Stidham will start at quarterback for Denver in the AFC Championship game next week at Mile High Stadium against the winner of Sunday's Patriots-Texans divisional matchup.

The Broncos did what they had to do to earn a 33-30 overtime win over Buffalo on Saturday.","1) Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold: There was only one demon left for Darnold to conquer this year and that involved his playoff reputation. Everybody who watched him in last year's Wild Card Round saw a jittery quarterback who melted down in a blowout loss to the Rams. That wasn't the guy who walked into Lumen Field for a Divisional Round matchup with San Francisco on Saturday night. Darnold had the comfort of knowing he was playing at home with a loaded roster that had earned the top seed in the NFC. All he had to do was be himself and not let an oblique injury that popped up late in the week bother him. Darnold did his part by completing 12 of 17 passes for 124 yards and a touchdown in a 41-6 win. He let his teammates handle the rest, which they gladly did. This always felt like a game that Seattle could run away with because of all the injuries that had plagued the 49ers over the season. That's exactly what it became, which was great for Darnold. He already had made the transition from gunslinger to game manager midway through the season. Saturday's game only reiterated how important it is for him to avoid turnovers along with the feeling of having to go win the game for the Seahawks. There clearly will be a tougher challenge facing this team next week, regardless of whether it's the Bears or Rams that come to Seattle for the NFC championship. One thing that should also be obvious is that Darnold learned some valuable lessons from last year's late-season struggles.

2) Broncos head coach Sean Payton: Let's be clear here -- Payton couldn't afford to go one-and-done after the regular season the Broncos enjoyed. This team broke the Kansas City Chiefs' nine-year run as AFC West champions. It captured the top seed in the AFC postseason bracket and displayed impressive resolve in going 11-2 in one-score games. All that was supposed to be part of the magic Payton was tasked with delivering when the Broncos hired him in 2023. Losing in the Divisional Round after such a successful year would've been an epic failure, especially in a postseason as wide open as this. The Broncos did what they had to do to earn a 33-30 overtime win over Buffalo on Saturday. Payton had a smart game plan for quarterback Bo Nix to execute, and the Denver defense made several momentum-altering plays to stifle Bills quarterback Josh Allen and the Buffalo offense. Payton made it clear that he wanted to be aggressive in this contest, and you saw Nix throw deep shots time and again when Buffalo used man coverage. Payton also had to compensate for a run game that only created 70 total yards and a receiving corps plagued by injuries early in the contest. Of course, the job now becomes far more challenging for the head coach as his team moves into the AFC championship game. Nix sustained a broken ankle on the last drive in overtime, an injury that ended his season. If the Broncos are going to win the Super Bowl this season, it will be with Jarrett Stidham under center. It's obviously a huge blow but backup quarterbacks have won championships in emergency duty before. It just means Payton will have to do more amazing things than he's already done with this team.

3) Seahawks wide receiver Rashid Shaheed: The acquisition of Shaheed has turned into one of the best midseason trades of the season. His speed has provided a big-play dimension to the Seahawks offense, and his special teams contributions have been just as critical to this team's success. Any questions about whether Seattle would be rusty after enjoying a bye during the Wild Card Round were answered right after the 49ers kicked off to start the game. Shaheed returned the ball 95 yards for a touchdown and literally gave Seattle all the points it needed for the rest of the night. Now let's rewind to Week 16, when the Seahawks trailed the Rams by 16 points with a little less than 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter. Seattle needed some miracles to mount a comeback in that situation and Shaheed responded with a punt return for a touchdown to start that rally. These are the types of plays that help teams win championships. The Seahawks don't have to feed the ball to Shaheed -- and they've been more conservative offensively in the second half of this season -- but his presence and versatility makes a big difference for Darnold and this offense.

4) Broncos defense: There are many things that Denver does exceptionally well on defense. Forcing turnovers wasn't one of them until Buffalo came to town on Saturday. The Broncos created five takeaways in that Divisional Round win over the Bills, which is crazy when considering that same unit produced 14 turnovers all year. This was an area Payton had emphasized during the bye week and it was vital that his team seized every opportunity that came its way. The Broncos couldn't outgain the Bills, as Buffalo amassed 449 yards to Denver's 349. The Bills also converted 10 of 15 third-down situations. So when it came down to the difference in this contest, it was the way those turnovers swung the game for Denver. A fumble by Josh Allen with two seconds left in the first half turned into a Wil Lutz field goal. A strip-sack of Allen on Buffalo's first possession after halftime set up another Lutz field goal. Of course, the play of the game came when Broncos cornerback Ja'Quan McMillian outfought Bills wide receiver Brandin Cooks on a deep pass in overtime to create an interception that thwarted Buffalo's last best chance at securing a win. A Cooks catch on that play would've set up a makeable field goal for the Bills. Instead, Denver took the ball and drove down for what became Lutz's fourth and final field goal of the day. The Broncos were already a nightmare for opposing offenses when it came to categories like sacks, red zone defense and points allowed. If this unit is going to continue taking the ball away like it did on Sunday, it might be good enough to make up for the loss of Nix.

5) Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III: Walker has been finding his groove in recent weeks, which is a great sign for this team. Walker ran for 116 yards and scored three touchdowns in Seattle's win over San Francisco. It shouldn't be surprising that he had a big day against the 49ers -- the Seahawks ran for 180 yards against San Francisco in the season-finale -- but Walker's production had been inconsistent earlier this year. He's now rushed for at least 97 yards in three of his last four games. More impressively, he's averaged nearly six yards per carry over the past month. You take a player heating up like that and combine his talents with Zach Charbonnet (who sustained a knee injury on Saturday) and you can see why Darnold isn't pressing anymore. If that run game keeps grinding away, that Seahawks offense is going to continue creating more headaches for anybody who gets in its way.

1) Broncos quarterback Bo Nix: There was every reason to think Nix would be the ultimate winner on Saturday night, right until Sean Payton returned to the interview room and announced his second-year quarterback's season had ended with a broken ankle. Nix had spent an entire game proving that he was ready for the postseason stage. He finished with good numbers (279 passing yards, three touchdowns and an interception), but his best work occurred in those high-leverage moments that have become Denver's trademark this season. Nix led his team to a go-ahead score in the final minute when Buffalo had all the momentum and a reason to a think another playoff upset was in the making. He hit Courtland Sutton with a crucial 25-yard pass on a third-and-11 during that drive and connected with Marvin Mims Jr. on a 26-yard touchdown toss. It's equally important to note that Nix played well despite losing some key receivers to injuries and the Broncos running backs producing all of 41 yards. The narrative around Nix all season had been that he was a player who could be maddeningly inconsistent until it mattered most. Well, he proved he was more than ready to lead this team to the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, he'll have to watch and hope the Broncos can now reach that summit without him.

2) Bills quarterback Josh Allen: There isn't much left to say about Allen when it comes to postseason defeats. He's dealt with some heartbreakers over the course of his career, but this one should hurt a bit more because of his role. We usually talk about the Buffalo supporting cast failing Allen in critical situations when the Bills lose in the playoffs. This time around, he was a big part of the problem. The same quarterback who's been phenomenal throughout his postseason career -- he hadn't given the ball away once in his last six playoff games -- ended up with four turnovers. Allen fumbled three times and lost two of those while also throwing two interceptions. Some of those turnovers came down to a Denver defender making a great play, like the one McMIllian made in ripping the ball away from Cooks in overtime for that interception. At other times, it was Allen simply trying to do too much, when he lost the football while scrambling with two seconds left in the first half and set up a Will Lutz field goal after Denver recovered that mishap. It's fair to say the Bills would've won that game if Allen could've avoided one of those turnovers. Since he didn't, this ends up being another year where Buffalo fans are left to wonder what it will take for this team to win a championship during his tenure. It's been said many times that Allen was poised to benefit from a postseason without Patrick Mahomes, Joe Burrow and Lamar Jackson playing. Turns out that advantage didn't take the Bills any farther than they've already been in recent years.

3) 49ers offense: Saturday's game with Seattle was never going to be a fair fight, not with all the issues the 49ers faced heading into it. For all the great work head coach Kyle Shanahan has done with a team beaten down by injuries, there was no way Seattle's defense was going to allow an upset with that kind of advantage. The Seahawks toyed with the 49ers in a season-ending win that decided the NFC West and top seed. Did we really think San Francisco had enough firepower left to deal with that unit after losing tight end George Kittle to a season-ending Achilles tear in the Wild Card Round? Give Shanahan and his team credit for beating Philadelphia last weekend. The problem with that win is it gave Seattle no reason to underestimate the 49ers coming into this one. The Seahawks allowed only 236 total yards on Saturday, which amounted to a paltry 3.9 yards per play. They also neutralized All-Pro running back Christian McCaffrey, who finished with 35 rushing yards and 39 receiving yards. The 49ers deserved all the credit in the world for what they accomplished in the face of so much adversity. But it was very likely that a beatdown was coming after so many setbacks, and that's exactly what happened this weekend.

4) Bills head coach Sean McDermott: You can't write about another disappointing postseason finish for Josh Allen without talking about what it means for his head coach. These two have been tied to each other ever since Allen arrived in Buffalo in 2018. They also both face more scrutiny than anybody else in that franchise when the playoffs conclude with another soul-crushing defeat. This year was always going to be tougher challenge for McDermott's team because the Bills needed to win three playoff games on the road to reach the Super Bowl. They managed to earn one victory in Jacksonville in last weekend's Wild Card Round, but few teams can weather five turnovers and keep advancing in the postseason. McDermott now moves into an offseason where there will once again be more debates about how far he can take this team. The New England Patriots have turned into a power again in the AFC East, and they have the look of a team that isn't going to be a one-hit wonder. There also are a few high-profile former head coaches available on the open market for a team looking to make a change and bolster its chances of winning a championship. McDermott has been one of the best coaches in the league throughout his nine-year tenure in Buffalo. That doesn't mean there won't be chatter about what somebody like former Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin could do with a squad as talented as the Bills. Sure, the odds of that happening aren’t great. But we're also living in a world where Tomlin and John Harbaugh (who is now with the Giants after Baltimore fired him) are no longer with the teams they spent years coaching.

5) Bills running back James Cook: Cook might have been the star of the game if Buffalo had pulled out that win against Denver. He ran for a game-high 117 yards on 24 carries and was the best player on the field for long stretches of the first half. In fact, it felt like the Bills were taking control of the game behind Cook's effectiveness until a second-quarter fumble at Denver's 32-yard line changed the game. Buffalo led 7-3 at that point. After linebacker Alex Singleton popped the ball loose from Cook -- and safety Talanoa Hufanga recovered it -- the momentum swing was palpable. That miscue turned out to be ominous because it was the first of five Bills turnovers. Who knows how much damage Cook could've done on Saturday if Buffalo had been more careful with the football? The Broncos certainly knew a huge key to the game was stopping him. They didn't succeed entirely but that fumble proved to be just enough to make a critical difference in the outcome.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/suuio61vgzqe5qke8tgk,N,,2026-01-18 06:59:43.746660

Payton began with ""not good news,"" and then said quarterback Bo Nix had fractured his right ankle three plays before Wil Lutz kicked a 23-yard field goal in overtime that gave the Broncos a 33-30 win over the Buffalo Bills in Empower Field at Mile High on Saturday.

Payton said Nix will have surgery to repair the fracture Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama. It means Nix will miss whatever remains of the Broncos' postseason run and Jarrett Stidham will be the team's starter.

""[Nix] is a tough cookie,'' Payton said. ""I said, 'Listen I believe you're the second quarterback in his second year to take his team to the [conference] championship game and the first is [Patrick] Mahomes.' ... We'll rise up for the next challenge.""

On a first-and-10 from the Buffalo 36-yard line with 6 minutes, 4 seconds left in overtime, Nix was tackled for a loss of 2 yards on a designed run. He quickly jumped up after the tackle to get back in the huddle but did have a slight limp.

He threw a deep incompletion intended for wide receiver Marvin Mims Jr. on the next play as Buffalo cornerback Tre'Davious White was flagged for pass interference. The ball was moved to the Bills' 8-yard line after the penalty, and Nix took the next snap and kneeled to stop the play.

On the kneel-down, his right ankle twisted awkwardly and Nix grimaced as he showed a pronounced limp as he moved back to the Broncos' sideline. Nix underwent X-rays following the game, and many of the Broncos' players had left the locker room by the time Payton announced Nix's injury, ""so, in essence I'm telling them now,'' Payton said.

Nix finished Saturday's win 26-of-46 passing for 279 yards, three touchdowns and an interception. The victory was also the sixth time this season Nix has led a game-winning drive in the fourth quarter or overtime.

Stidham, who was signed by the Broncos as a free agent in 2023 -- Payton's first season -- has appeared in one game this season. Stidham played four snaps, including a kneel-down to end the game, in the Broncos' 44-24 win over the Dallas Cowboys in Week 8.

Stidham appeared in three games in the 2024 season, Nix's rookie year, but did not attempt a pass. His last significant playing time came in 2023, when he started the final two games of the season after Payton benched Russell Wilson.

Stidham threw two touchdowns to go with an interception in those two games combined, including a 16-9 win over the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 17 that season. Sam Ehlinger, who spent most of the season on the Broncos' practice squad before he was signed to the roster last week, will be the team's backup.

""Stiddy is ready to go,'' Payton said. ""... He's ready, he's ready. I feel like I've got a two who's capable of starting for a number of teams and I know he feels the same way. Watch out, just watch.''

Payton said he spoke to Nix briefly outside the locker room after Nix had been given the news from the Broncos' medical staff. He said Nix told him it was the third time he had suffered a fractured ankle in his football career, including once in high school and once when Nix was at Auburn.

""[He is] such a strong faith-based guy, [he's] sitting in the hallway with his family,"" Payton said.

On what he thinks the team's reaction will be, Payton added, ""They'll be disappointed, will be a lot of emotions, but then the refocus takes place. We celebrate the season for him. Listen, Stiddy is ready, we'll be ready for the next challenge. ... [Stidham] is experienced, he's played in games, they're different types of players to some degree and yet they're very close friends. It's a tight room. ... Here we go.''",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2026%2F0117%2Fr1601960_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 06:59:52.931860

Just over an hour after the game ended, head coach Sean Payton announced that Nix had broken a bone in his ankle on the second-to-last play of the game.

“Not good news. On the second to last play in overtime, Bo fractured a bone in his right ankle,” Payton told reporters. “He’s scheduled to have surgery Tuesday of this week to put him out for the rest of this season. … It was the second to last play before he threw the pass to (Marvin) Mims.”

Jarrett Stidham, who appeared in one game this year and took just four snaps without attempting a pass, will replace him at QB next week.

It’s a shocking development following a thrilling game in the Mile High City. In a postseason already characterized by late-game dramatics, the Broncos emerged victorious from the first overtime game of the playoffs, beating the Bills.

It was a measure of revenge for the Broncos after the Bills eliminated them last year. Their 33-30 victory, Denver’s first playoff win at home in a decade, sends them to the AFC Championship.

The Broncos won it on an easy field goal after the Bills defense committed a pair of pass interference penalties for a total of 47 yards on the final drive of the game.

That was indicative of how Buffalo’s blunders proved costly. The Bills finished the game with 100 more yards than the Broncos, but were undone by untimely turnovers — five total as a team, including four by Josh Allen, who had committed only six turnovers through his first 14 playoff games prior to tonight.

Nix, whose only previous playoff start was the loss to the Bills last season, threw for three touchdowns. The 25-year-old appeared poised, even as Buffalo ramped up its pass rush in the second half.

Cameras showed Nix looking in pain on the sideline before the game-winning field goal but he did not appear to be walking with any major limp after the game.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2256807351.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2026-01-18 06:59:58.900175

The Broncos will host their first AFC championship in a decade next weekend, after defeating the Buffalo Bills with a field goal in overtime. But they'll be playing without quarterback Bo Nix, who suffered a broken right ankle late in Denver's playoff win.

Coach Sean Payton delivered the stunning news about his second-year quarterback in the aftermath of Denver's biggest win in a decade. Backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham will start next weekend.

“Stiddy’s ready,” Payton said after returning to the postgame lectern to discuss the injury following Denver's 33-30 victory.

Payton said Nix got hurt on a keeper where he lost 2 yards and was tackled by safety Cole Bishop. Nix was limping after the play, but there was no indication that he suffered such a serious injury.

On the next play, Nix threw a deep pass to Marvin Mims Jr. that drew a 30-yard pass-interference flag and got the Broncos well into field-goal range. Nix then took a knee to center the ball for Wil Lutz's game-ending 23-yard field goal.

Payton said Nix will have surgery Tuesday in Birmingham, Alabama.

“He's such a strong, faith-based guy,” Payton said. “He's sitting in the hallway with his family and coming over and we're all talking to him. He knows that God's got a plan for him and he said he had (a broken ankle) in high school and then he said he had one at Auburn.

“And I said I didn't realize that. I said if I had known that I wouldn't have drafted you,” Payton cracked.

The locker room had cleared out and reporters were waiting in an interview room for Nix when Payton returned and delivered the news.

A win in overtime

On Saturday evening, a fourth quarter nail-biter saw the teams trade the lead, with the Broncos down 27-23 with four minutes to go. Denver managed to score with less than a minute left on the clock, pulling ahead 30-27. But former Broncos kicker Matt Prater nailed a 50-yard field goal for the Bills with 5 seconds left in regulation, tying it at 30-all.

On their second possession of overtime, Broncos kicker Wil Lutz ended the game with 24-yard field goal. The Bills were flagged for pass interference twice on Denver's final drive.

Nix threw for 279 yards and three touchdowns in the course of the game.

The AFC title match up will be held at Sunday, Jan. 25 at Empower Field at Mile High, where Denver has won 14 of its last 15 games. It's the team's first time hosting an AFC championship in a decade, since the “No Fly Zone” defense that helped them win Super Bowl 50.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/CPR-Masterbrand-1500x1000-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 07:00:19.338694
