Will they pick on a weakness … again? The Chargers, in their 27-21 Week 1 victory over the Chiefs in Brazil, provided a roadmap for the rest of the league to follow when it came to attacking K.C.’s defense.

Specifically, quarterback Justin Herbert feasted when going to play action. According to NextGen Stats, Herbert finished 9 of 11 for 169 yards on those attempts, which began a trend that was often repeated afterward.

SumerSports’ data has the Chiefs defense as worst in the NFL when going against play action, allowing 0.49 expected points added on those attempts. For context, Cleveland’s defense is second worst but still much better at 0.33 EPA per play allowed, while on typical downs, K.C.’s defense allows only 0.02 EPA/play.

Herbert and the Chargers actually haven’t been super-productive with play action for the season, ranking 15th in efficiency. Given their success in Game 1, however, expect them to test the Chiefs often in this area again.

Jacksonville are 4-1 against teams with a losing record this season. Buoyed by four straight wins (during which they have outscored opponents 125-52), the NFL’s No 1 rushing defense is yet to allow a 100-yard rusher in 13 games.

Parker Washington returns from a hip injury to strengthen a constantly rotating receiving corps, which continues to come up with answers. It helps that Trevor Lawrence is playing with confidence and poise with Jakobi Meyers making a significant impact since joining on November 4. In five games, Meyers has caught 22 of 30 for 284 yards with three touchdowns - one in the past three games. And running back Travis Etienne needs 83 rushing yards for his third 1,000-yard season.

Against a rookie quarterback making his first NFL start, the Jags are 13.5-point favorites. The last time they were favored by such a margin was in 2007 against the Oakland Raiders (they won 49-11). All signs point to a Jaguars win. Dangerous territory, perhaps. But they have comprehensively handled business recently and played balanced, complementary football and looked like the AFC’s No 3 seed of late.

Bills WR Gabe Davis is a healthy scratch against the Patriots, the team confirmed to The Athletic ahead of kickoff. The move is a surprising one, given quarterback Josh Allen's trust level in Davis, and also because Davis has been at the top, or near the top of the leading snap count earners in their receiver room for three straight weeks.

Davis made a clutch catch on a fourth down play against the Bengals in Week 14. Without Davis, the Bills will go with the group of Khalil Shakir, Joshua Palmer, Keon Coleman, Tyrell Shavers and Brandin Cooks. Palmer returned today from a two-week absence due to an ankle injury.

Quietly, one of the Chiefs’ biggest issues defensively has been an inability to create turnovers.

In K.C.’s last five games combined, it has one takeaway: a first-quarter interception against Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott on Thanksgiving.

The Chiefs should have a great opportunity to reverse that trend Sunday. The Chargers have been careless with the ball quite a bit recently, with quarterback Justin Herbert throwing two interceptions with an additional lost fumble in Monday’s win over the Philadelphia Eagles.

Some of this comes down to luck, of course. It seems whenever the Chiefs defense tips a ball in the air, it deflects to an empty space on the field. Or when they create a fumble, the ball has bounded to a spot where the offense can recover.

This sort of thing continues the theme of the Chiefs season, where they just haven’t been good enough in the margins to turn close losses into wins. Sunday offers a new opportunity to make one or two game-changing defensive plays.

The Chiefs and Chargers are set to play on what is forecast to be Kansas City’s coldest day over the next month.

There are some important caveats, though. Snow is not in the forecast, and it’s not supposed to be windy, either. The sun should be out as well, meaning a kickoff temperature in the teens should actually feel warmer than the thermometer indicates.

It’s still unclear how a warm-weather team like the Chargers will respond to these conditions. The Chiefs are used to them — they practice in them each week, with some guys like tight end Travis Kelce taking part in those workouts in short sleeves and shorts.

K.C., in a must-win game, might’ve actually benefited more if the conditions were worse. It still wouldn’t be a surprise, though, if the Chiefs are the team better equipped to handle these weather conditions early.

FOXBORO, Mass. – Since Week 7, the Patriots have played with a light box on defense more than any other team in the NFL.

Essentially, they dare teams to try to run it on them, happy that the lighter boxes will help the Pats slow down opposing passing offenses. So far, it’s been a successful strategy.

But in recent games, the Patriots’ run defense has slowed a bit, and it poses a fascinating matchup Sunday since the Bills, with James Cook, have a really good running offense.

So I’m watching today how dedicated the Bills are to running the ball, whether the Pats will be content to play with light boxes, and how any Bills success on the ground early impacts the Patriots’ gameplan.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Chiefs will be without All-Pro cornerback Trent McDuffie for Sunday's home game against the Los Angeles Chargers, as he was listed as a gameday inactive after suffering a knee injury last week.

McDuffie, who was questionable coming into the game, leaves a void in the Chiefs secondary as the team's unquestioned top defensive back. Jaylen Watson should slide into the No. 1 slot today, and third-round rookie Nohl Williams should now see extended snaps for a second straight week.

One other note: Chiefs fourth-round receiver Jalen Royals, who hasn't played since Week 7, is a gameday active with Hollywood Brown (personal) out for Sunday's game.

Here's the Chiefs' full inactives list:

OT Jawaan Taylor

OG Trey Smith

WR Hollywood Brown

TE Jared Wiley

CB Trent McDuffie

DT Zacch Pickens

RB Elijah Mitchell

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ --- The Giants will be in a tough spot of their own making at returner Sunday with WR Gunner Olszewski inactive. Olszewski suffered a concussion in Week 13, but the team team went up to the last minute with the receivers' availability for Sunday.

But in the mean time, the Giants didn't elevate two other return options (Ihmir Smith-Marsette and Xavier Gipson) on their practice squad. So who will act as returner now? CB Deonte Banks and RB Devin Singletary are the kickoff returners while safety Jevon Holland acted as punt returner when Olszewski was injured in Week 13.

Other inactives include: OLB Kayvon Thibodeaux, WR Ryan Miller, P Jamie Gillan, T James Hudson III, DL Rakeem Nuñez-Roches Sr. and QB Russell Wilson (3rd QB).

Ravens starting wide receiver Rashod Bateman is inactive for Sunday’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals because of an ankle injury. Bateman, who was limited in Thursday’s practice and didn’t practice Friday, will miss his third game this season.

Wide receivers DeAndre Hopkins, Devontez Walker and Tylan Wallace will all likely have bigger roles with Bateman sidelined.

Outside linebacker Tavius Robinson, who hasn’t played since Week 6 because of a foot fracture, and defensive back Ar’Darius Washington, who has been out the whole season after tearing his Achilles in May, are active.

The Ravens five inactives are emergency No. 3 quarterback Cooper Rush, Bateman, offensive lineman Joseph Noteboom, defensive tackle Aeneas Peebles and cornerback Keyon Martin.

Bills inactives vs. Patriots: WR Gabe Davis, OT Tylan Grable, OT Chase Lundt, DT Phidarian Mathis, LB Terrel Bernard, CB Christian Benford, S Darnell Savage

The most significant member of the inactive list is top cornerback Christian Benford, who suffered a toe injury during Thursday's practice. The Bills were veering toward full health of their 53-man roster for the first time this season, but Benford's in-practice injury meant they'd be shorthanded at cornerback. In his place, the Bills will use the combination of Tre'Davious White and Maxwell Hairston as their starting boundary cornerbacks. The Bills will get wide receiver Joshua Palmer back into the lineup after he missed a pair of games with an ankle injury. Only having room for five receivers on the game day roster, the Bills made Gabe Davis inactive. It remains to be seen if Davis was a healthy scratch for the game, though Davis was not listed on the injury report during the week.

Davis was not seen on the field with the receivers during the usual pregame warmups. Starting middle linebacker Terrel Bernard is inactive once again and will miss a third straight game. Shaq Thompson will start in his place.

Los Angeles Chargers WR Quentin Johnston is inactive for Sunday’s game at the Kansas City Chiefs. Johnston practiced on Wednesday and Thursday this week, but he appeared on the injury report Friday with a groin injury. Johnston was listed as limited for Friday’s practice. The temperature at game time at Arrowhead Field is projected to be under 20 degrees. Those are not ideal conditions for a player trying to return from a soft-tissue injury in a limited timeframe. With Johnston out, rookie Tre’ Harris will have a huge opportunity Sunday.

Harris has carved out a role primarily as a blocker in coordinator Greg Roman’s offense. The Chargers have weaponized Harris in various rushing concepts, including as a lead blocker in power. But he has not made the same kind of impact as a receiver, with Johnston, Ladd McConkey and Keenan Allen ahead of him on the depth chart. Harris has 20 catches for 185 yards on the season. Harris will likely take over Johnston’s position as the Chargers’ X receiver. In that role, Harris could get some chances to make plays down the field, particularly in 50-50 ball situations, one of the strengths of his skillset.

Full Chargers inactives:

WR Quentin Johnston (groin)

OT Trey Pipkins (ankle)

S Elijah Molden (hamstring)

CHICAGO -- Veteran guard Joel Bitonio and wide receiver Cedric Tillman are active today for the Browns despite having been listed as questionable on Friday's injury report.

The Browns had previously ruled out seven players due to injury: tight end David Njoku, cornerback Denzel Ward, guard Wyatt Teller, running back Dylan Sampson, offensive tackle Jack Conklin, defensive tackle Adin Huntington and guard Zak Zinter.

Longtime starting center Ethan Pocic was placed on injured-reserve last week after suffering a torn Achilles tendon. Luke Wypler takes over as the starting center with the hopes of being able to become the starter in 2026.

Wypler and right tackle KT Leveston are the only starting Browns offensive linemen today who are signed for 2026. Saturday, the Browns signed rookie guard Garrett Dellinger from the practice squad to the active roster so that Dellinger can serve as a potential backup option at both guard and center today.

It's the fourth start for rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who threw for 364 yards and three touchdowns last week. Sanders has developed a rapport with rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr., the Browns' leading receiver, and the two rookies have connected on touchdown passes in each of the last two weeks. But with the offensive line injuries and issues, expect the Bears to mix up their looks and blitzes to try to keep Sanders from getting comfortable.

No opposing quarterback is comfortable with Browns defensive end Myles Garrett looming. Last week, Garrett became the 13th player to reach 20 sacks in a season. Garrett enters today just 2.5 short of the NFL's single-season sack record currently shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt.

With a clear emphasis on not letting Garrett blow up their game plan, the Titans ran for 184 yards on the Browns last week in Cleveland. Expect a run-heavy plan from the Bears today, too. The Bears totaled 281 rushing yards in a Week 13 upset in Philadelphia and will use both veteran starter D'Andre Swift and rookie Kyle Monangai heavily.

With the Browns shorthanded at multiple spots, expect Sam Webb to start at cornerback in Ward's place and veteran defensive tackle Maurice Hurst to see time also. Hurst was signed to the practice squad last week and elevated on Saturday. As expected, rookie defensive tackle Mason Graham is active despite dealing with a rib injury.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/VnTrvdjsDfr8_hYdkIfhtspdY_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-14 12:59:50.506897

Spillane is officially active for Week 15, which is huge for New England's run defense, in particular, against the Bills potent rushing attack led by star RB James Cook. The Patriots game-day inactives are OLB Bradyn Swinson, OT Marcus Bryant, DT Eric Gregory, TE C.J. Dippre, WR Efton Chism III, and QB Tommy DeVito is the emergency third quarterback.​

Along with Spillane being active, the well-rested Patriots will also get NT Khyiris Tonga, LG Jared Wilson, and special teams ace Brenden Schooler back from injury this week. All three regulars are returning to the lineup after being inactive for New England's victory over the Giants in Week 13. Pats captain Harold Landry III, who has been managing a knee injury, also seemed to benefit from the bye week as he didn't carry an injury designation into Sunday's game. As one would hope, the bye week helped the Patriots roster get healthier.​

Starting on the defensive side of the ball, Spillane was first limited by his foot injury when he only played 69.1% of the defensive snaps in Week 13. In the previous eight games, Spillane played every defensive snap, so his lower snap count vs. the Giants was notable. The Pats captain is the team's starting MIKE linebacker and defensive signal-caller, playing a major role in the middle of the defense. This season, the Pats defense allows a stingy -0.03 expected points added per rush when Spillane is on the field compared to +0.05 EPA per rush without Spillane – a substantial difference. Buffalo comes into the week ranked seventh in rush EPA, while Cook is second in the NFL with 1,308 rushing yards. The Bills rushing attack is very underrated, with most of the attention on MVP quarterback Josh Allen. In Week 5, holding Cook to a 36% success rate was a big reason why the Patriots won.

With the Patriots captain active, Spillane's workload and effectiveness will be worth monitoring during the game. Tonga's return should also help the Pats stop the run, as the 335-pound nose tackle has helped New England hold opponents to -0.10 EPA per rush when Tonga is on the field – the Patriots need two of their best run defenders at their best. That said, if Spillane is limited by his foot injury, the Patriots could lean more on linebackers Jack Gibbens and Christian Elliss. Jahlani Tavai is also active as a sturdier early-down run stuffer, while LB Marte Mapu could have a role in the passing game on Sunday.

Moving over to the other side of the ball, the Patriots offensive line gets a boost by the return of rookie Jared Wilson. After playing only three snaps in a Week 12 win over the Bengals, Wilson sat out the Patriots last game against the Giants due to an ankle injury. The third-rounder is expected to return to being the starting left guard, while the Pats still have reliable backup G/C Ben Brown as insurance, as they start their fourth different line combination of the season. The expectation is that the Patriots starting offensive line will be LT Vederian Lowe, LG Jared Wilson, C Garrett Bradbury, RG Mike Onwenu, and RT Morgan Moses.​

Offensively, the other uncertainty was at running back, with RB Terrell Jennings ruled out due to a concussion. On Saturday, the Patriots signed RB D'Ernest Johnson to the active roster to back up top backs Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. After being elevated three times earlier this season, Johnson was out of standard elevations, meaning he had to be signed to the 53-man roster to be active. New England made room for Johnson on Saturday by placing Jennings on injured reserve. Johnson has some experience on special teams, including returning kickoffs, making him an obvious choice to step in for Jennings.

QB Drake Maye's Supporting Cast

OL - LT Lowe, LG Wilson, C Bradbury, RG Onwenu, RT Moses

WR - Diggs, Boutte, Hollins, Douglas, Williams

TE - Henry, Hooper, Westover (FB), Tonga (short-yardage FB)

RB - Stevenson, Henderson, Johnson

The good news is that the majority of the Patriots skill players around QB Drake Maye this week are all active. New England will have all their regular contributors available to match Allen and the Bills offense. Above is a look at Maye's supporting cast for Sunday's game against Buffalo.

As for Buffalo, the Bills are getting starting DE Joey Bosa (hamstring/wrist) and RT Spencer Brown (shoulder) back from injury. However, Bills top CB Christian Benford (toe) and LB Terrel Bernard (elbow) is inactive. Benford was a mid-week addition to the injury report after suffering a toe injury during Thursday's practice. He's the Bills best corner, logging a pick-six to spark Buffalo's comeback win over the Bengals last week, and might've covered Patriots wideout Stefon Diggs in key situations. Benford being inactive is a huge blow to Buffalo's defense, which will rely more on vet Tre'Davious White and first-rounder Maxwell Hairston at cornerback.

With a win, the Patriots would dethrone the Bills after a five-year run as kings of the AFC East. Buffalo has won five-straight division titles, with New England's last AFC East crown coming in Patriots Hall of Famer Tom Brady's final season in New England (2019). To win the division in their first season under head coach Mike Vrabel would be a huge accomplishment, especially after having back-to-back four-win seasons before Vrabel arrived.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/ciefxkkkmcvxzltk2uhr,N,,2025-12-14 13:00:06.878891

Coupled with their own first-round pick (currently seventh), the Jets would have plenty of ammo to trade up for a player.
When the Jets and Colts made the Gardner deal at the Nov. 4 trade deadline, the Colts were 7-2, looking like a Super Bowl contender.
""I was fortunate enough to have a coach that believed in me the same way I believe in Wilks,"" Glenn said.","JACKSONVILLE -- A look at what's happening around the New York Jets:

1. One team's misfortune ... : Is the Achilles curse working in reverse?

The Jets, doomed by Achilles injuries in 2023 (Aaron Rodgers) and 1999 (Vinny Testaverde), could benefit greatly from last week's season-ending injury to Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones.

No one wants to see a player get hurt, but the Jets own the Colts' 2026 and 2027 first-round picks that they acquired in the Sauce Gardner trade. Currently, the 2026 pick is 18th overall. The Colts (8-5), already reeling before the Jones injury, have a brutal remaining schedule -- Seattle Seahawks, San Francisco 49ers, Jacksonville Jaguars and Houston Texans.

Combined record: 36-16.

If the Colts lose out, the draft pick could go as high as 13th, give or take a spot. Coupled with their own first-round pick (currently seventh), the Jets would have plenty of ammo to trade up for a player. Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, anyone?

That would be a stunning turn of events.

When the Jets and Colts made the Gardner deal at the Nov. 4 trade deadline, the Colts were 7-2, looking like a Super Bowl contender. Jets officials figured the draft pick would be toward the bottom of the first round. Now the Colts have lost three straight and face the prospect of starting quarterback Philip Rivers, 44, five years removed from retirement.

This is the same Rivers whom the Jets defeated in their next-to-last playoff run, in the 2009 season, when he played for the San Diego Chargers.

One final twist: A Jets loss Sunday to the Jaguars, who are one game ahead of the Colts in the AFC South, could hurt Indianapolis' playoff bid. The Jets have only a 24% chance to win, per ESPN Analytics.

2. Same as it ever was: This is the Jets' eighth trip to Jacksonville to play the Jaguars, dating back to 1996, and not once have they arrived with a winning record. Think about that for a moment.

3. Another one-and-done? One of the top storylines over the final four games will be the future of defensive coordinator Steve Wilks.

The defense is ranked 28th in EPA (Expected Points Added) and has only one takeaway in what has amounted to a transition year, an on-the-fly rebuild accelerated by the trades of Gardner and Quinnen Williams.

Ultimately, coach Aaron Glenn's decision will be based on whether he believes Wilks is the right man to lead the defense through the next phase of the rebuilding process. No doubt, there will be many new pieces to integrate in 2026.

Statistically, the defense has regressed over the course of the season. The EPA went from 26th over the first seven games (-23.66) to 29th over the last six (-47.12). The only starter exceeding expectations is defensive tackle Jowon Briggs, which doesn't reflect well on player development.

Wilks acknowledged the defense has been ""inconsistent at times, for sure,"" but he also believes there were a handful of encouraging performances.

Glenn was in Wilks' shoes in 2021 -- his Detroit Lions defense was among the league's worst -- but he had the support of coach Dan Campbell. He gave Glenn another chance as the coordinator, which proved mutually beneficial in the long run.

""I was fortunate enough to have a coach that believed in me the same way I believe in Wilks,"" Glenn said.

That might sound like a vote of confidence, but Glenn said he will evaluate his staff at the end of the season. Chances are, he will make some changes. Wilks understands the business; he was a one-and-done coach in his last five jobs.

4. Interception drought update: There have been 298 interceptions in the league, including five by Jaguars linebacker Devin Lloyd, but none by the Jets. They're one game shy of the all-time mark for most consecutive games without a pick (14 games by the 2024 49ers).

5. One tough Cook-ie: What are the Jets getting in rookie Brady Cook, who makes his NFL starting debut? At Missouri, he was known for his toughness.

Against Auburn last season, Cook injured an ankle on the opening drive, went to the hospital for an MRI and returned to lead two fourth-quarter touchdown drives in a 21-17 victory -- his signature game in college.

""He showed the type of leader he is, what he meant to our team,"" said tackle Armand Membou, a college teammate of Cook.

Cook becomes the first undrafted rookie in 50 years to start for the Jets.

6. Big (Apple) Turnover: The Jets have an inordinate number of pending free agents -- 22 of the 53 players on the current roster. They secured one potential free agent by signing center Josh Myers to a two-year, $11 million extension Friday. Four of their five starters on the offensive line are under contract for 2026. The Myers move likely means former center Joe Tippmann will remain at guard. Still unsigned for '26 are Breece Hall, Quincy Williams, Nick Folk and Alijah Vera-Tucker (injured reserve).

Yes, the revolving door will be spinning in the offseason.

7. Will they? The Jets must decide by May whether to exercise Will McDonald IV's fifth-year option for 2027, projected at $15 million. Once thought to be a no-brainer, this decision will require some careful thought.

McDonald probably will lead the team in sacks for the second straight year, but four of his seven came in one game. Consistency has been an issue, as most of his pass-rushing metrics are down from last season.

8. Lukewarm endorsement: One of the big moves last offseason was a three-year, $45 million extension for middle linebacker Jamien Sherwood, whom Glenn dubbed the quarterback of the defense. The returns haven't been stellar. Here's a brutally candid assessment by Wilks:

""I think, in my opinion, Sherwood is having a decent year. Up and down a little bit in regards to the tackling.""

9. What might have been: Facing Trevor Lawrence in a late-season game with no playoff implications will always conjure memories of the Jets' franchise-altering 23-20 victory on Dec. 20, 2020, over the Los Angeles Rams.

At 0-13, the Jets were on their way to the No. 1 pick in the 2021 draft -- Lawrence, the clear-cut top prospect. They went to Los Angeles a 17-point underdog, the second-largest spread in Jets history (second only to the 18-point spread in Super Bowl III).

Punter Braden Mann's touchdown-saving tackle on a fourth quarter return secured the win, allowing the Jaguars to leapfrog them in the draft order. A few days later, Mann told ESPN he received blowback on social media from angry Jets fans.

Lawrence has experienced his share of struggles over the years, but he has far outperformed the quarterback chosen No. 2 overall by the Jets -- Zach Wilson, who's on his third team.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1212%2Fr1588539_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 08:57:51.698472

Detroit Lions coach Dan Campbell said Friday, Nov. 21, that LaPorta underwent back surgery and likely will miss the rest of the year, including Sunday's game against the L.A. Rams at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California..

“So look, Sam did have a procedure and he's going to be out for a while,” Campbell said during his press conference in Allen Park. “A while. I think we would be fortunate to have a chance to get him back for the rest of the season, at some point. I think that's very, very slim.”

LaPorta injured his back in the Lions’ Nov. 9 win over the Washington Commanders, was placed on injured reserve and missed a Nov. 16 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Brock Wright is recovering from a trachea injury and not expected back until the playoffs, and Shane Zylstra, out for weeks, was listed as questionable on Friday, and activated from IR on Saturday. He and Anthony Firkser – with two catches for 11 yards in three games – are the only tight ends on the Lions' 53-man roster entering Sunday's game.

That timeframe would have him cleared for training camp next summer, ESPN is reporting.

Kirk Cousins tore his Achilles tendon in Week 8 of the 2023 season with the Vikings and was back on the field for training camp after signing with the Atlanta Falcons, nine months after the injury. It's unclear if he could have returned sooner -- as Jones will have to -- if he has suffered the injury later in the season.

The 2026 NFL season will start on Sept. 13 with training camp beginning in late July; a nine-month recovery would have put Jones back on the field for the end of the preseason.

Jones is a free agent after this season and that timeframe would be beneficial for negotiations with teams looking for a quarterback after his promising season with the Colts. Cousins, 35 at the time of his injury but with a longer track record than Jones, received a four-year, $180 million deal with a $50 million signing bonus and $100 million guaranteed after his torn Achilles tendon.

The Colts will reportedly start 44-year-old Philip Rivers in Jones' place Sunday in Seattle, according to media reports. Rivers, who hasn't played for 5 years, was signed earlier this week.

Defensive tackle Derrick Harmon (knee) and tight end Darnell Washington (concussion) are questionable.

Night practice

Temperatures at kickoff are expected to be in the teens, but McDaniel said that wasn’t the driving force behind the decision to practice in Pittsburgh on Saturday evening.

“That’s something that we kind of considered in the offseason,” McDaniel said. “The odd part of a schedule is a Monday night on the road. It always feels like you’re so far removed from the last time you were on a football field. Doing it this way allows us our final full-speed practice about 48 hours from kickoff.”

He said acclimating to the weather is “an added bonus that we get to get ourselves into the environment. But realistically, that’s something we’ve been thinking about for a while to keep consistency 48 hours from kickoff having their last activity.”

League fines

The NFL fined Achane and Jaylen Wright for what it deemed a “violent gesture” in their celebration after Achane’s 13-yard touchdown run last Sunday against the Jets.

Achane was fined $8,238, while Wright was fined $6,388.

The Dolphins running backs become the latest among a handful of players who have been fined for a “nose wipe” gesture.

That gesture “has gang connotations; it’s disrespectful,” Troy Vincent, the NFL’s executive vice president of football operations, said in late March when the gesture was banned.

“It’s just where we are in society. Young men, they come from that era, from that age, and they’ve grown up on social media. If anybody Goggled ‘nose wipe,’ you’ll see the language that is used and where that’s affiliated. I think the players know better. I know they know better.”

Defensive line news

The Dolphins’ three rookie defense tackles - Kenneth Grant, Jordan Phillips and Zeek Biggers - have become competent NFL rotation players.

The question is whether more impact plays will follow. Grant has two tackles for loss all season and Phillips has just one. Do they need more of those to become very good defensive linemen?

No, defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver said.

“I don’t measure their success in tackles for loss,” Weaver said. “So much of what they do is unheralded and not on the stat sheet. A lot of the positive plays they have create positive plays for guys around them. A lot of people that benefit from selfless acts they do.”

Brooks and Dodson are so appreciative of the work of the defensive line that they’ve taken out the linemen for dinner on multiple occasions, Grant said.

They enjoy going to Capricco, an Italian restaurant in Pembroke Pines.

Grant says one goal is to generate more negative plays.

Weaver said the rookie defensive linemen are “absolutely” capable of that:

“That comes with football intelligence, gathering football information. You can actively see them calling out plays. Negative plays will come.”

Weaver said Phillips “has been pretty solid for the bulk of the year. Early on he was hanging on blocks too long when there was opportunity to make plays. He remedied that.

“Kenneth turned the page that Cleveland game. Once we got to that Cleveland week and that week of practice, I was like, ‘All right, I think the light switch might have gone off,’ and I don’t ever see that going backwards.”

Grant said he has improved in the area of watching film - and knowing what to look for - by watching Zach Sieler and Benito Jones and taking coaching from Austin Clark.

“I’ve become a better film studier,” he said. “In college, you watch film, but there’s a different way you watch film in the league. Watching how Zach watches film, I try to create that for myself.”

It has helped him learn “a team’s favorite runs and their tendencies.”

This and that

McDaniel on Saturday raved about tight end Greg Dulcich, a capable blocker who has become an asset in the passing game in recent weeks. He had three receptions for 41 yards against the Jets last week.

“Greg has been a very pleasant surprise just in general because you typically don’t have a guy assimilate as fast as he has and that’s a credit to him and ‘Embo’ [Jon Embree] and Frank Smith and Bobby Slowik,” McDaniel said.

“He is very good football player with the nuances of getting leverage on defenders, how to be able to separate from them with an understanding of the timing of the play. Then he is a tough guy to tackle. I knew his hands and ball skills were good and that he had route running ability.”

▪ Dolphins practice squad receiver A.J. Henning on Monday will serve the second game of a two-game suspension for violating the league’s policy on performance enhancing substances.

Robinson has missed the past seven games due to a foot injury and Washington is set to make his season debut after suffering an Achilles injury in May.

The Ravens only had 51 players on their roster, so they didn't have to make any cuts to accommodate Robinson and Washington's returns.

Robinson led the Ravens with two sacks before going down, and his return adds more bite to the defensive front in tandem with defensive end Dre'Mont Jones.

The Ravens will need to do well slowing down Bengals running back Chase Brown and getting pressure on quarterback Joe Burrow, who threw for 261 yards and two touchdowns in their meeting two weeks ago.

""I'm hoping to get back out there, bring a little juice and bring that energy,"" Robinson said. ""[I want to] just give the energy to go out there and get it done and affect the quarterback.""

""Recovery timeline is still TBD, but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today,"" J.J. wrote Dec. 12. ""He and his family are very appreciative of everyone’s kind words and well wishes.""

Pneumothorax, or a punctured lung, is a possible result of dry needling, though very rare.

Dry needling refers to a form of physical therapy with large needles designed to stimulate blood flow around muscular and soft tissue injures. Former Packers employee and NFL commentator Andrew Brandt said it's common for players to receive treatment at their own facilities.

""For insertion around chest, there is some risk of pneumothorax that needs to be fully explained before treatment,"" Brandt wrote.

T.J., who was not on the injury report prior to the development, won't play Dec. 15 on Monday Night Football when the Steelers face the Dolphins and presumably will be lost for multiple weeks. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network posted Dec. 12 that Watt was expected to play again this season.

ESPN reported that the NFL Players Association had been in touch with Watt over the incident. ""Our main immediate priority is supporting T.J.'s health and full recovery,"" the NFLPA said in a statement.

Watt, 31, who has been named a Pro Bowler each of the past seven years and received top-five standing in the defensive player of the year voting in five of those years, may not have the numbers that match his recent production but remains a difference maker. In 13 games this season, he has seven sacks, two fumble recoveries, three forced fumbles, seven passes defended and an interception, with 10 tackles for loss and 18 quarterback hits.

Watt played football at Pewaukee High School and became an All-American linebacker at the University of Wisconsin. He momentarily became the highest paid non-quarterback in NFL history with a three-year, $123 million contract extension before the year.","https://www.jsonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/11/USAT/87718516007-usatsi-27764683.jpg?crop=5994,3372,x5,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-14 11:03:42.465559

Commanders star quarterback Jayden Daniels will return to the bench after re-aggravating a previous injury, while the Jets and the Raiders will roll out backup signal-callers.

Elsewhere, two star wide receivers face concerns stemming from concussions, with Cowboys wideout CeeDee Lamb poised to play and Bengals receiver Tee Higgins set to miss his second game in the past three weeks.

See who's in and who's out for Week 15:

QB Jayden Daniels (Commanders)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Elbow

Daniels will miss the Commanders' Week 15 game against the Giants. He returned from a four-game absence last week but re-aggravated his left elbow injury and will return to the bench. It's his seventh absence of an injury-riddled season. With Washington (3-10) not having much to play for, it'll opt for caution with its franchise quarterback. That said, veteran Marcus Mariota will make his seventh start of the season.

QB Tyrod Taylor (Jets)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Groin

Taylor will miss the Jets' Week 15 game against the Jaguars with a groin injury. In four games as a starter this season, he has led the Jets to a 1-3 record. With Taylor out, undrafted rookie Brady Cook will make his first NFL start.

QB Geno Smith (Raiders)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Shoulder/Back

Smith will miss his first game of the season when the Raiders face the Eagles in Week 15. In 13 starts this season, Smith has thrown for 2,648 yards, 16 touchdowns and a league-high 14 interceptions. Las Vegas (2-11) is currently tied for the worst record in the league. Backup Kenny Pickett will start in Smith's place.

WR Tee Higgins (Bengals)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-DNP

Injury: Concussion

Higgins will miss the Bengals' Week 15 game against the Ravens. He sustained a concussion in Week 14 after returning from that same injury the week prior. Surprisingly, Higgins returned to practice in a limited fashion on Wednesday and Thursday, leaving hope that he could return later this season. Sunday will mark Higgins' second absence of the season — both against Baltimore. In 12 games, he has 46 catches for 667 yards and nine touchdowns.

WR Rome Odunze (Bears)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Foot

Odunze will carry a questionable tag into the Bears' Week 15 game against the Browns. He has been dealing with a stress fracture in his foot for the past few weeks, and it kept him out of a game for the first time this season last week. After a week of rest, however, he could return to the field to help Chicago in its fight for the NFC North after losing the division lead to the Packers last week. After a hot start to the season, Odunze has struggled since getting injured, hauling in just 13 catches for 188 yards and one touchdown over the past five weeks.

TE David Njoku (Browns)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Knee

Njoku will miss the Browns' Week 15 game against the Bears. He sustained a knee injury catching a touchdown — his only catch of the game — from quarterback Shedeur Sanders in Week 14. Njoku has 33 catches for 293 yards and four touchdowns under his belt so far this season. With Njoku out of the lineup, rookie Harold Fannin Jr. will have the tight end snaps all to himself and will look to continue to build on an impressive season.

RB Josh Jacobs (Packers)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-Limited

Injury: Knee

Jacobs will carry a questionable tag into the Packers' Week 16 game against the Broncos. He has played through lower body injuries throughout this season and might try to do the same against this week. Despite the minor injuries stacking up, Jacobs has totaled 817 rushing yards and 12 rushing touchdowns in 12 games this season.

RB Christian McCaffrey (49ers)

Practice schedule: DNP-Limited-Full

Injury: Illness/Back

McCaffrey will carry a questionable tag into the 49ers' Week 15 game against the Titans. He missed Wednesday's practice with an illness before returning Thursday. He was upgraded to a full participant on Friday. However, on Saturday, he was added to the injury report with a back issue, so his status for the game is once again up in the air.

WR CeeDee Lamb (Cowboys)

Practice schedule: Limited-Full-Full

Injury: Concussion

Lamb will be active for the Cowboys' Week 15 game against the Vikings on Sunday night. He sustained a concussion that forced him out of the team's bout with the Lions in Week 14, but 10 days off helped him not miss time. It's crucial that the Cowboys have their top pass-catcher this weekend, as they're fighting for a playoff spot. In 10 games this season, Lamb has 57 catches for 865 receiving yards and three touchdowns.

McCaffrey should be good to go for the San Francisco 49ers' game against the Tennessee Titans despite being deemed questionable on Saturday afternoon due to a back injury, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported, per a source.

CMC sat out Wednesday's practice while dealing with an illness and was limited Thursday, through he initially went into the weekend without a designation following a full session Friday.

Given San Francisco's extensive injury history this season, a back issue popping up for McCaffrey likely raised some alarm bells among fans.

While key offense players such as Brock Purdy, George Kittle, Jauan Jennings and Ricky Pearsall have all been absent at different points of the year, McCaffrey has remained as a constant, keeping the Niners moving toward a potential playoff berth despite all the missing pieces.

He's logged a league-leading 322 touches for San Francisco, turning workhorse usage into 849 rushing yards, 806 receiving yards and 13 total touchdowns. He's both the team's leading rusher and receiver by a wide margin.

Thankfully, he's expected to remain in the fold Sunday.

If McCaffrey's back gives him any trouble during the game -- or even if all systems are a go -- the 49ers could still presumably play it smart with their star running back. He entered Week 15 as the only player in the NFL with 300 or more touches, currently averaging 24.8 per game.

The Niners are in the stretch run now, in playoff position with an outside shot (10%) at winning the NFC West. While it'd be unwise to take the 2-11 Tennessee Titans lightly, it's also important McCaffrey remains upright for upcoming games against the Colts, Bears and Seahawks, plus a hopeful postseason run.

Should McCaffrey take a few less snaps, Brian Robinson will be first up to step in.

Lamb returned to practice as a full participant on Thursday as his recovery has gone well enough for him to return for Sunday Night Football.

""Process has been cool. Obviously, it's been a lot of eye work and eye discipline and trying to, I guess, frustrate myself essentially to see if I have any more residuals of the concussion. And I haven't had any type of symptoms,"" Lamb said. ""As for me now, it's been heavy on rest, to be honest.

[NFL injury updates live]

Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt had successful surgery to ""stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung,"" according to his brother J.J.

Watt was in a dry needling treatment session at the team's practice facility on Wednesday when he started to feel discomfort. There is no timeline for a recovery, but was released from the hospital on Friday and will not play Monday night against the Miami Dolphins.

Other notable Week 15 injuries:

Cincinnati Bengals receiver Tee Higgins has been ruled out for Sunday's matchup with the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion. Higgins missed Week 13 with a concussion and found himself back in protocol this week after getting injured last week against the Buffalo Bills. Higgins was evaluated in-game and cleared to return, but Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said Monday that the receiver was back in protocol. He was limited during Thursday's practice and ultimately ruled out Friday afternoon.

The Washington Commanders have already ruled quarterback Jayden Daniels out for Week 15 due to aggravating an elbow injury in Week 14's loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Daniels had just returned from a three-game absence after dislocating that elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. Marcus Mariota will start his seventh game this season when the Commanders face the New York Giants on Sunday.

Trey Benson will not return this season after the Arizona Cardinals chose not to activate him from injured reserve during his 21-day practice window. The running back has been out since Week 4 with a knee injury. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Benson had not progressed enough to warrant a return this season.

Injuries to his right shoulder and back will sideline Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Geno Smith for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Kenny Pickett has been taking first-team reps this week and will start as head coach Pete Carroll called Smith ""day-to-day.""

Ravens at Bengals (1 p.m.

Cardinals at Texans (1 p.m.
Dolphins at Steelers (8:15 p.m.","We've reached Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season, and while some teams aim to make late-season pushes into the postseason, others are keeping one eye on the upcoming NFL Draft and the other on their roster to see which players should and shouldn't return. Making things more complicated at this stage of the year is injuries, and there are quite a few notable ones for bettors to know for Week 15. Here's a breakdown of the most important injuries of Week 15, as well as what NFL betting lines look like per the latest DraftKings Sportsbook odds. We will update this post with inactives lists for every team prior to kickoff. All times Eastern.

Ravens at Bengals (1 p.m. ET)

CIN WR Tee Higgins (concussion, out)

Star Cincinnati receiver Tee Higgins is out this week with his second concussion of 2025, both of which have occurred over the last month. The Ravens need a win to try and keep pace with Pittsburgh for the division lead after dropping two games in a row to fall to 6-7.

The Ravens are 2.5-point favorites, while the total is very high at 51.5.

Raiders at Eagles (1 p.m. ET)

LV QB Geno Smith (right shoulder and back, out)

PHI OT Lane Johnson (foot, out)

Kenny Pickett will be under center for the Raiders against his old team,as the former first-round pick will start in place of the injured Geno Smith, who's dealing with shoulder and back injuries. The Eagles will again be without star tackle Lane Johnson, which is bad news against Maxx Crosby.

Vegas is a 12.5-point underdog here, with the total at just 38.5.

Cardinals at Texans (1 p.m. ET)

AZ WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (heel, out)

HOU RB Nick Chubb (ribs, questionable)

Marvin Harrison Jr. headlines another lengthy injury list for the Cardinals, who have lost five in a row and are just 3-10 on the year. The Texans are on the opposite end of the spectrum, having won five in a row, but they may be without veteran running back Nick Chubb as he's questionable to play against a lackluster Arizona defense.

Houston is a 9.5-point favorite, and the total sits at 42.5.

Chargers at Chiefs (1 p.m. ET)

LAC WR Quentin Johnston (groin, questionable)

KC WR Hollywood Brown (personal, out)

KC OL Trey Smith and Jawaan Taylor (out)

The Chargers aren't the only AFC West team with issues on the offensive line, as two Kansas City starters are out for this matchup on Sunday. The Chiefs will also be without veteran receiver Hollywood Brown in this must-win matchup, while the Chargers have listed receiver Quentin Johnston as questionable.

Kansas City is a 6-point favorite, and the total is 40.5.

Bills at Patriots (1 p.m. ET)

No major injuries of note

Arguably the game of the week sees the Bills visit the Patriots in an AFC East clash. New England has won 10 in a row after a 1-2 start and is aiming to spoil the Bills' bid to win the division for the sixth year in a row.

Buffalo is favored by 1.5, and the total is 49.5.

Jets at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)

NYJ QB Tyrod Taylor (groin, out)

NYJ QB Justin Fields (knee, out)

NYJ TE Mason Taylor (neck, out)

A weird season for the Jets will be made even weirder this weekend with undrafted rookie Brady Cook starting at quarterback with both Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields out. Cook completed 14 of his 30 attempts last week in relief of an injured Taylor, and he won't have reliable tight end Mason Taylor to throw to in this matchup with the AFC South-leading Jaguars.

Jacksonville is favored by 13.5. The total is 41.5.

Commanders at Giants (1 p.m. ET)

WASH QB Jayden Daniels (left elbow, out)

WASH WR Deebo Samuel (illness, questionable)

WASH RB Chris Rodriguez (groin, questionable)

The Commanders' offense is beat up with Jayden Daniels ruled out after returning last week only to get knocked out once again. Marcus Mariota will start, and it's unclear if he'll have Deebo Samuel to throw to as the veteran receiver is questionable with an illness. Washington mixes up its running back rotation quite a bit, and Chris Rodriguez is also questionable.

The Giants are 2.5-point favorites, and the total is 46.5.

Browns at Bears (1 p.m. ET)

CLE TE David Njoku (knee, out)

CLE RB Dylan Sampson (calf and hand, out)

CLE CB Denzel Ward (calf, out)

CHI WR Rome Odunze (foot, questionable)

Cleveland will be down two weapons on offense with veteran tight end David Njoku and rookie running back Dylan Sampson both ruled out. Top cornerback Denzel Ward is also out for the Browns' elite defense. For Chicago, the Bears are hoping to get receiver Rome Odunze back for this matchup after he missed last week's loss to Green Bay.

Chicago is favored by 7.5, and the total is 38.5.

Panthers at Saints (4:25 p.m. ET)

NO RB Alvin Kamara (knee and ankle, out)

The main injury here is that the Saints will be without top running back Alvin Kamara once again. The veteran is out with knee and ankle injuries in this divisional clash with the Panthers, who can take first place in the NFC South with a win thanks to Tampa Bay's loss on Thursday.

Carolina is a 2.5-point favorite, and the total is 40.5.

Lions at Rams (4:25 p.m. ET)

DET S Brian Branch and Kerby Joseph (out)

LAR WR Davante Adams (hamstring, questionable)

This massive NFC clash sees the Lions again dealing with major injuries on defense, and that's especially true in the secondary as both of the team's starting safeties are out. The Rams expect Davante Adams to play, but he is questionable with a nagging hamstring injury.

The Rams are 6-point favorites while the total is the highest of the Week 15 slate at 54.5.

Colts at Seahawks (4:25 p.m. ET)

IND QB Riley Leonard (knee, will be active)

IND CB Sauce Gardner (calf, out)

The big story here is who will start at quarterback for the Colts. Daniel Jones tore his Achilles last week and is out for the year, so Indianapolis signed Philip Rivers, who last played in 2020, to the practice squad. Rookie Riley Leonard played in place of Jones last week and also suffered an injury, but he'll be active in Seattle. Whether he starts is another question altogether. Defensively, the Colts will be down star cornerback Sauce Gardner against the Seahawks' high-flying offense.

The Seahawks are 13.5-point favorites, and the total is 42.5.

Packers at Broncos (4:25 p.m. ET)

GB RB Josh Jacobs (knee, questionable)

The Packers and Broncos square off in what very well could be a Super Bowl preview on Sunday, and Green Bay is hoping to have its top running back on the field as Josh Jacobs is questionable. If he can't go, Emanuel Wilson would serve as lead back as third-string back MarShawn Lloyd has been ruled out.

Denver is a 2.5-point favorite at home. The total is 42.5.

Titans at 49ers (4:25 p.m. ET)

SF RB Christian McCaffrey (back, questionable)

Star 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey was added to the injury report on Saturday with a back injury ahead of Sunday's matchup with Tennessee. This would leave Brian Robinson as San Francisco's lead back should McCaffrey be inactive.

San Francisco is favored by 12.5 while the total sits at 44.5.

Vikings at Cowboys (8:20 p.m. ET)

DAL TE Jake Ferguson (calf, questionable)

It looks like Dallas' offense will be at full strength, which wasn't a certainty entering the week. Star receiver CeeDee Lamb cleared concussion protocol and will suit up this week, while tight end Jake Ferguson is expecting to play on Sunday despite being listed as questionable.

Dallas is favored by 5.5 points. The total is 48.5.

Dolphins at Steelers (8:15 p.m. ET, Monday)

PITT LB T.J. Watt (lung, out)

Star Pittsburgh edge rusher T.J. Watt won't suit up this week after he suffered a collapsed lung that required surgery after a dry needling treatment. It's unclear if or when Watt will return this season for the AFC North-leading Steelers.

The Steelers are 3-point favorites at home. The total is 42.5.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/10/22/9ba602fb-8eab-4ec3-be43-adfc80417a80/thumbnail/1200x675/f9c3e1e60c2462860b5a7e4bbbd35eae/jayden-daniels.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 23:58:09.646992

Strong is now available to coach Matt LaFleur for Sunday's showdown with the Denver Broncos.

Wilson is listed as questionable to play. So is starting running back Josh Jacobs, who only practiced once this week because of recurring swelling and stiffness in his injured knee. The only healthy running back on the 53-man roster for the Packers is Chris Brooks, making Strong a necessary elevation for Sunday against the Denver Broncos.

Wilson, if available, would be looking at an increased role at running back and a potential start in place of Jacobs. But with his status now in question, the Packers may need to scramble at the position before facing the NFL's No. 1 ranked defense against the run.

Brooks is a capable blocker and receiver who has played in all 13 games for the Packers this season. Strong, a fourth-round pick in the 2022 NFL draft, has played in 46 career games. His 125 career touches have gained 692 yards, and he's also returned 24 career kickoffs.

The belief still is that Jones will play next year in Indianapolis, but his contract expires after this season and he is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent.

A training camp return would be an aggressive timeline for Jones, but the Colts think it's possible -- and this thinking is going to inform their offseason approach to free agency, a team source told ESPN's Stephen Holder. Indianapolis is expected to have a better idea of Jones' progress by April.

Jones and the Colts did not have any discussions about an extension while the quarterback was having a resurgent season and leading Indianapolis to the top of the AFC South. Last Sunday, Jones fell to the ground, slammed his helmet in frustration and knew that he had torn his Achilles -- before the MRI even confirmed it.

Both Jones and the Colts, who were highly pleased with each other, have significant decisions to make. Jones is expected to be interested in returning to Indianapolis, but he also could have other options. The Colts are expected to try to re-sign Jones, but the question will be the cost.

The Colts could opt to use the franchise tag on Jones, which is expected to come in around $45 million to $46 million this offseason, according to league sources.

But for now, Jones' focus will be on recovering from the Achilles surgery and getting ready for the 2026 season.

Jones has demonstrated the ability to be a quick healer in the past. While playing quarterback for the New York Giants in 2023, Jones tore his ACL but returned for the start of the 2024 season.

The Colts (8-5) have lost four of their past five games after their strong start, falling out of the AFC South lead and into the No. 8 overall seed for the seven-team playoff field.",https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1207%2Fr1586311_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 23:58:12.340790

Jones underwent surgery Tuesday after rupturing his Achilles tendon in Sunday's 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars and was ruled out for the season. Jones was also dealing with a fractured fibula and a calf injury before he suffered the Achilles injury.

Before going down, Jones was having a career season in his first year with the Colts. He threw for 3,101 yards, 19 touchdowns and 8 interceptions. Jones was just 104 yards short of his career-high for passing yards and six touchdowns away from his personal best in passing touchdowns.

Despite the change in scenario, injuries have continued to plague the 28-year-old quarterback. Jones has not missed an entire season in his career. He played in 16 games in 2022, resting only during the final week to prepare for the playoffs.

Jones spent his first six seasons with the New York Giants before being released and signing with the Minnesota Vikings midway through last season. This offseason, he signed a one-year, $14 million contract and ultimately won the starting job over Anthony Richardson. Jones will be a free agent after this season.

Rookie quarterback Riley Leonard finished the game for the Colts, throwing for 145 yards and one interception. Leonard, who dealt with a knee injury earlier this week in practice, was cleared to play on Sunday.

With injuries to Jones, Leonard and Richardson, the Colts signed 44-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers to the practice squad on Tuesday. Rivers, who last played in 2020, is set to start against the 10-3 Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.

In Rivers’ last season with the Colts, he threw for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.

The Jets will play Jacksonville at noon CT on Sunday in Jacksonville, where Mizzou, coincidentally, will play its bowl game later this month.
The Jets signed Cook as an undrafted free agent shortly after the 2024 NFL Draft.
Cook was Mizzou’s starting quarterback from 2022-24.","Former Missouri football quarterback Brady Cook is set to make his first professional start.

New York Jets starting quarterback Justin Fields has been ruled out of the team’s game Sunday, Dec. 14, against the Jacksonville Jaguars with a knee injury, and backup Tyrod Taylor will miss the matchup with a groin injury.

That means Cook, who played for the Jets in relief after Taylor was injured in a 34-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins this past Saturday, has been elevated to the starting role. His backup will be former Kansas State QB Adrian Martinez.

""Brady will be our starting quarterback this week,"" Jets head coach Aaron Glenn told reporters this week. ""He's gotten all the reps with the ones, and Adrian (Martinez) will be our backup.""

Cook went 14-of-30 passing for 163 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions against the Dolphins. He entered the game with the Jets already trailing 21-0.

The Jets will play Jacksonville at noon CT on Sunday in Jacksonville, where Mizzou, coincidentally, will play its bowl game later this month.

“It was just a tough situation for him, not getting a chance to get all the reps,"" Glenn said. ""But now, this week, he's had a chance to get all the reps with (the) ones, get a chance to communicate with the O-line, with the receivers, with the tight ends, with the coaching staff on exactly how we want to go about playing this game.”

Added Glenn: “I have all the confidence in the world. That's something I've stated from the very beginning. (Cook will) be a good player in this league, and he'll have his opportunity again this week.""

The Jets signed Cook as an undrafted free agent shortly after the 2024 NFL Draft.

Cook was Mizzou’s starting quarterback from 2022-24. The St. Louis native and Chaminade grad won 26 games as Mizzou’s starter over those three seasons, helping Missouri record back-to-back double-digit win years in 2023 and 2024.

The quarterback will play alongside former MU teammate and right tackle Armand Membou, who was drafted with the No. 7 overall pick by the Jets and has started every game this season.

Cook registered more than 10,000-career all-purpose yards, which ranks fourth all-time at Missouri. With 9,013 career passing yards, he ranks third all-time in the category at Mizzou. He is the only MU quarterback in program history with more than 9,000 passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards.

The quarterback’s best season with the Tigers came in 2023, when he threw for 255.2 yards per game and 21 touchdowns and five interceptions in 13 starts. He also rushed for 319 yards and eight scores.

Cook appeared in 46 total games for Mizzou with 39 starts. He passed for 49 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.

""I've been nervous before any football game I've ever played. I'm excited. It's important,"" Cook told reporters this week. ""This is everything I've ever done. So, there's a level of importance there that it's going to create nerves. But whenever I (run) out onto the field and take that first snap, it's gone.

After suffering a torn Achilles tendon in the playoffs last season, Tatum began an arduous rehab journey that was expected to hold him out for the entire year. However, he appears to be well ahead of schedule when it comes to his injury rehab, and reports indicate he wants to play this season.

Given how frequently fans have seen Tatum getting work in on the court as late, some folks believe it’s a matter of when, not if, he returns to action this year. However, according to one team insider, it sounds like the C’s still intend on proceeding with caution when it comes to their franchise player.

“Within the organization he continues to indicate that he would like to return this season,” Adam Himmelsbach of The Boston Globe reported. “It probably falls somewhere between possible and likely, but a league source stressed that the team remains several steps away from even considering the decision.

Tatum must still reach several mile markers in his recovery before discussions about a return can be considered.”

Considering how well Boston has played to begin the year, getting Tatum back could instantly make the team a legit title contender. The team isn’t losing sight of its long-term future, though, which could ultimately lead to him being held out for the entire year.

The better the Celtics play, though, the more hope fans will have that he can come back at some point this season.

He was a limited participant on Thursday with an illness, but was bumped up to a full participant on Friday and was cleared with no injury designation on the injury report heading into Sunday’s game against the Tennessee Titans.

Well, on Saturday, the 49ers added McCaffrey to the injury report again with a back issue. He is now listed as questionable for tomorrow’s game.

He has yet to miss a game for San Francisco this season, and it’s the first time he’s popped up with a designation since being questionable with a calf injury in Week 1.

So far this season, McCaffrey is third in the NFL in carries (237) and 13th in rushing yards (849), while scoring eight rushing touchdowns in 13 games. He’s also fifth in the NFL in receptions (85), top-20 in receiving yards (806), and is tied with George Kittle for the lead in receiving touchdowns on the 49ers (5).

While it’s unclear the severity of the back issue, we’ll see if the 49ers look to hold McCaffrey out as a precaution against the 2-11 Titans or if he’ll be a full go at game time on Sunday.

In last week's loss to the Denver Broncos, Smith suffered a right shoulder injury, which will keep him out of Sunday's road matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles (1 p.m. ET / Fox).

Before Smith's injury, his production hadn't met his or the team's expectations when the 35-year-old signal-caller was traded from the Seattle Seahawks in the offseason. Through 13 games, Smith has thrown for 2,648 yards with 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions. He also has a completion rate of 67% and a QBR of 32.5 -- ranked 30th in the league.

Here's everything you need to know about the Raiders' quarterback situation ahead of Week 15's contest.

Who's next up at quarterback for Las Vegas?

Backup Kenny Pickett is set to make his second start in two seasons, and he said it's a ""great opportunity"" to face the Eagles.

Pickett received valuable first-team reps throughout the week, with the expectation that he will take Smith's place. Aidan O'Connell, who has been the team's emergency third quarterback in recent weeks, will be the primary backup.

Raiders coach Pete Carroll called Pickett an athletic player and a good thinker. Carroll added that he has coached ""the hell out of him"" so that Pickett would be ready whenever an opportunity to play emerged.

""This is exactly how we did it with Geno for years [in Seattle],"" Carroll said. ""And however long it takes for the opportunity, he's going to be ready to go.""

In extended playing time against the Broncos, Pickett impressed the coaching staff. He completed 8 of 11 passes for 97 yards and a touchdown in the fourth quarter of the Raiders' 24-17 loss.

Pickett completed six straight passes, including a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Shedrick Jackson. Pickett was 4-of-4 with 83 yards on attempts for 10-plus air yards.

""He managed it in a very difficult situation,"" interim offensive coordinator/quarterbacks coach Greg Olson said. ""He had two two-minute situations and scored 10 points. So, it was good to see.""

Olson admired Pickett's mobility, which allowed him to extend plays. The Raiders hope to use this skill set to their advantage Sunday.

""Even in college, he did a lot of things there with his legs,"" Olson said. ""So, he gives us that part of his game, maybe, not that Geno isn't mobile, but the ability to escape and run and create and do some of those things.

""... We expect that going forward.""

Pickett was traded from the Cleveland Browns before the start of the season after O'Connell fractured his wrist in the Raiders' preseason finale against the Arizona Cardinals. At the time, the Raiders were searching for an experienced veteran to fill the backup position, and Pickett fit the mold.

Pickett has played for four teams since he was drafted in the first round by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2022.

After two seasons with the Steelers, Pickett was traded to the Eagles last offseason and played behind Jalen Hurts. The Browns traded a 2025 fifth-round pick and quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson for Pickett in March.

Pickett was competing to be the Browns' starter but didn't play in the preseason after injuring his hamstring in practice July 26.

In 33 career games (25 starts), Pickett has thrown for 4,870 yards, 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions while completing 62.4% of his pass attempts. He is 15-10 as a starter.

""He's been actively taking charge when he gets the opportunities in practice, and we put him in a lot of competitive situations to try to force him to the front,"" Carroll said. ""... He's as ready as a guy can be that hasn't done much playing.""

How long is Smith expected to be out?

Carroll said Smith is on the right track after receiving treatment throughout the week. Carroll added that there's a ""really good chance"" that Smith will be available for next week's matchup against the Houston Texans on the road.

Carroll stated Wednesday that health will be the only reason that Smith will remain sidelined, despite Smith's inconsistent on-field production.

Smith is also dealing with a lower back injury that has been concerning for the two-time Pro Bowl QB, Carroll said. Smith has been in and out of the training facility throughout the week to get tested. But Carroll sounded optimistic about Smith's right shoulder.

""He hasn't thrown this week very much, but it's manageable,"" Carroll said.

What this means for the Raiders' matchup against the Eagles

The Raiders hope Pickett could help snap their seven-game losing streak while extending Philadelphia's skid to four games.

Pickett will have tight end Michael Mayer and rookie wide receiver Dont'e Thornton Jr. back in the lineup after both players missed last week's game because of injuries.

The Eagles' offense has struggled in recent weeks (averaging 16.2 points in the past five games), which could open the door for Las Vegas to potentially steal a road win. At the same time, it will come down to how well the offensive line holds up against the Eagles' defensive front.

Las Vegas ranks 21st in pass block win rate (59.6%) and run block win rate (70.5%).

Due to the expected snowy and cold weather conditions in Philadelphia, the Raiders could rely heavily on rookie running back Ashton Jeanty, even though his production has been inconsistent for most of the season.

The Eagles are 26th in rushing yards allowed (132 per game) but have given up 450 yards in the past two games.

If the Raiders can be impactful in the run game, that should take a bit of pressure off Pickett.",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1212%2Fr1588515_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 03:59:11.803607

McCaffrey logged a full practice on Friday after an illness hindered his availability to participate earlier in the week. Him not being on the initial injury report Friday brought a sigh of relief to San Francisco, but a new back injury might bring a bigger concern.

The 49ers offense has dealt with a number of injuries throughout the season, most notably to quarterback Brock Purdy and tight end George Kittle, but McCaffrey's reliable presence has steered the ship.

McCaffrey leads the team in both rushing (849) and receiving yards (806) while also generating the most touchdowns (13) for the Niners. Being without their workhorse RB might not be so crucial against a two-win Titans team on Sunday but there's cause for concern should the back injury linger down the final stretch.

Brian Robinson portends to get more snaps with McCaffrey ailing or especially if he is unable to suit up Sunday. Robinson has averaged 4.6 yards per carry in his role as the No. 2 backfield option.

That took place in the summer because Aiyuk missed team rehabilitation sessions for his injured right knee.
As recently as early December, general manager John Lynch expressed some hope Aiyuk might practice but acknowledged it was increasingly a long shot.
I think that's where I'd leave that ... We're a better football team when Brandon is out there, but that's probably what it is.","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Although the San Francisco 49ers publicly expressed some hope that receiver Brandon Aiyuk would return this season, that optimism ran out Saturday when the team moved Aiyuk to the reserve/left team list.

That designation, which is generally used for players who intend either to retire or to temporarily step away from football, means Aiyuk is ineligible to play for the 49ers in 2025. Aiyuk, who has been recovering from a torn ACL, MCL and meniscus in his right knee, has not been seen around the facility in recent weeks, and his placement on the list suggests he hasn't been around the team or participating in rehab sessions.

It also is likely the next step toward an offseason divorce between the Niners and Aiyuk. On Thursday, Niners tight end George Kittle hinted that Aiyuk wasn't likely to be back.

""At this point, it doesn't seem like he's coming back,"" Kittle said. ""I try my best to not even think about it because I love Brandon. He's one of my favorite teammates I've played with. We have a lot of moments together from his rookie year, every year we've played together. That's the Brandon I remember. So, if I think about the 'I wish he'd be here,' it kind of just makes me sad.""

The extent of the discord between the sides became public late last month when it was revealed that the Niners had voided roughly $27 million in guarantees Aiyuk had in his contract for 2026. That took place in the summer because Aiyuk missed team rehabilitation sessions for his injured right knee.

Before Saturday, Aiyuk had spent this season on the physically unable to perform list because of the knee injury, with the Niners hoping that somewhere along the way they could open his 21-day practice window and potentially get him back on the field.

Coach Kyle Shanahan said early in the season the hope was to get Aiyuk back practicing sometime around midseason.

As recently as early December, general manager John Lynch expressed some hope Aiyuk might practice but acknowledged it was increasingly a long shot.

""[Is it] realistic? I'm not sure,"" Lynch told KNBR radio on Dec. 2. ""Hopeful? Yeah. I think that's where I'd leave that ... We're a better football team when Brandon is out there, but that's probably what it is. Hope.""

After signing a four-year, $120 million contract extension with the Niners in August 2024 following contentious negotiations, Aiyuk injured his knee on Oct. 20, 2024. He had surgery the following month and has been working his way back since.

Now, the Niners and Aiyuk are likely to part ways this offseason with a decision still to be made on how that will happen.

Since the 49ers voided his future guarantees, they would take on a nearly $30 million dead money cap charge if they released him in the offseason. They could also designate him a post-June 1 release to eat $13.325 million in dead money next year and the rest in 2027. The same numbers would apply if the Niners were able to trade Aiyuk.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0903%2Fr1381630_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 22:00:13.843996

Yet, a league source said the issue didn’t seem like anything that would keep the running back out of Sunday’s game against the Tennessee Titans.

It’s been an odd week for McCaffrey. He had his usual “veteran” day off Wednesday, then missed most of Thursday’s session due to an illness. He practiced in full on Friday, with Kyle Shanahan saying McCaffrey would be a full-go for the game. Then on Saturday, McCaffrey reported having a minor issue with his back. The team usually holds a walk-through practice on Saturdays.

If his back were to worsen and he couldn’t play, Brian Robinson Jr. would get his first start of the season, backup Isaac Guerendo likely would see his first carries of 2025 and fourth-round draft pick Jordan James would be activated for the first time.

Their lack of usage speaks to McCaffrey’s health in 2025. He popped up on the injury report in Week 1 with a calf strain, but ended up starting that game and every one since. He leads the league in touches (322) and is third behind the Atlanta Falcons’ Bijan Robinson and the Indianapolis Colts’ Jonathan Taylor in scrimmage yards.

He’s also on pace to become the first player to have two seasons of 1,000-plus rushing and 1,000-plus receiving yards, having first accomplished the feat in 2019 when he was with the Carolina Panthers. At his current pace, he’d finish with 1,110 rushing yards and 1,054 receiving yards.

WR Rashod Bateman, Baltimore | Ankle | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

Rashod Bateman was added to Thursday's injury report with an ankle injury. While it's unclear whether this is the same ankle issue that caused him to miss Weeks 11 and 12, that appears likely given that he did not practice on Friday.

At this point, Bateman seems to be on the wrong side of questionable heading into the weekend.

WR Quentin Johnston, LA Chargers | Groin | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

Quentin Johnston was a late addition to the injury report, a trend you never want to see. He did not practice on Friday due to a groin injury, and assuming this is a new issue, it's unlikely Johnston will play in Week 14.

Groin injuries can be particularly limiting for wide receivers, given the demands of cutting and acceleration. Until Johnston can log at least a limited practice, his availability remains in serious doubt.

WR Rome Odunze, Chicago | Foot | Questionable | Projecting Inactive

The Rome Odunze situation is difficult to assess. While it's unclear how long Odunze has been dealing with the stress fracture in his foot, after sitting out Week 14, it's fair to question how much true healing could have occurred in just one week. Odunze was limited all week, but there does appear to be some optimism that he will play.

Whether he should play is the next question, and whether fantasy managers should trust him is another. Foot injuries are difficult for any athlete, especially NFL wide receivers who rely on explosion and sharp cutting. Even if Odunze suits up, I recommend leaving him out of fantasy lineups this week.

Gordon was already ruled out for Sunday's game against the Cleveland Browns after not practicing during the week. The 25-year-old nickel corner was going through warmups at Lambeau Field on Dec. 7 when he sustained a groin injury and was ruled out just before kickoff.

Gordon has been limited to three games this season while dealing with multiple soft tissue injuries. He missed a significant portion of training camp and the Bears' first four games with a hamstring injury. He was later placed on injured reserve for the first time this season after sustaining calf and groin injuries ahead of the Bears' Week 8 loss at Baltimore. Gordon returned in Week 13 and played 36 snaps in Chicago's win at Philadelphia.

""It's disappointing,"" coach Ben Johnson said. ""I wish I had a better feel for the individual, but with him being out as much as he has, I haven't really gotten to see him on the field and competing and get to know him like I'd like to at this point yet. I do know that the biggest predictor of a soft tissue injury is having a previous one, and he's kind of in this rut right now that we're not able to get out of, and so we're going to exhaust all of our resources in and outside of the building to make sure we're addressing it and doing what we can to get him back and healthy again.""

To make room, the Cardinals placed defensive lineman Bilal Nichols on IR with a knee injury, officially ending a second straight frustrating season for the veteran.

Jones, a 2024 fifth-round draft pick, has been plagued by preseason injuries in both his NFL seasons. As a rookie, he spent most of the season on IR with an ankle injury. This year, it was a knee injury that landed him on the sideline. With Johnson hurting his knee last week against the Rams, Kelvin Beachum is expected to start at right tackle and rookie Josh Fryar at left tackle.

The Cardinals, with multiple wide receiver injuries, will also elevate wide receivers Trent Sherfield Sr. and Jalen Brooks from the practice squad for a second straight game.

Nichols signed a three-year free-agent contract in 2024, and hadn't missed a game up until that point in four NFL seasons. But last season he played just six games because of a serious neck injury. That rehab lasted into this season. He finally came off IR but appeared in just four games, missing one for the birth of his child and becoming a healthy scratch in a couple of others. He hurt his knee against the Rams and was already deemed out for Sunday's game.

Even with the IR move, the Cardinals already have seven other players listed as out for Sunday, making for an easy inactives listing. The elevation of the two receivers means wide receiver Xavier Weaver (hamstring) is likely to miss another game.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cardinals/itzn3yx2xpnvtcpm7sqc,N,,2025-12-13 20:59:06.907373

As the Niners returned from their bye this week, McCaffrey said he was ""rested and recovered"" on Wednesday, taking his usual veteran's rest that day. He then was limited in practice on Thursday with an illness but was a full participant in Friday's practice, which is more of a walk-through.

""I know he wasn't feeling well, but he looked good today,"" coach Kyle Shanahan said on Friday.

That seems to indicate the back issue flared up either after Friday's practice or sometime Saturday. McCaffrey has not missed a game this season after he was limited to just four contests in 2024 because of Achilles and knee injuries.

If McCaffrey were unable to go, Brian Robinson would step into the starting running back role with Isaac Guerendo and rookie Jordan James available as potential backups. Guerendo has been limited to special teams only, taking zero offensive snaps, and James has yet to be active in a game this season.

""Brian to me, like his last seven games have probably been his best game seven times in a row,"" Shanahan said Friday when asked why James has yet to be active. ""I think he just keeps getting better. I've been real pumped with [James] in practice, and it would be awesome to get four guys up, but you're only using really two on offense. So, it's got to make sense with the rest of the roster.""

Now, 10 weeks later, they need to repeat that feat in order to lock up the division and crown themselves champion for the first time since 2019.

For a victory in the rematch with Buffalo, however, the team of head coach Mike Vrabel will need to bring its A-game. The Bills, after all, are far from dead and stayed the course even after losing to New England earlier in the year: at 9-4, they still have a chance to win their sixth straight division title, and a victory on Sunday would help boost their chances to snatch the top spot away from the Patriots after all.

As always when going up against an opponent of that quality, a complete game is need in all three phases. That said, our eyes will be on a handful of players in particular: considering the circumstances and opponent, here are our pivotal Patriots for Sunday’s game.

RB Rhamondre Stevenson

The Bills run defense has improved slightly over the course of the season, but it is still ranked toward the bottom of the league in efficiency categories such as yards per carry (5.1) and EPA per run (0.045). For New England and its lead running back, this presents an opportunity.

Rhamondre Stevenson has had an up-and-down year so far; he missed time with a toe injury and fumbled three times over the first five weeks of the season, but also has contributed some big plays as a runner and receiver while additionally showing some good pass protection. Considering Buffalo’s defensive weaknesses, one would expect him to be in line for a solid game. Then again, despite scoring two touchdowns, Stevenson was a relative non-factor in the first meeting between those two teams.

WR Stefon Diggs

In his first ever trip back to Orchard Park, Diggs was the most impactful skill position player on the field. Catching 10 passes for 146 yards in Week 5, he willed the Patriots to victory over his former team. To repeat as victors in front of the Gillette Stadium crowd, a similar performance would go a long way.

A veteran of 11 NFL seasons, Diggs knows that no two games are alike. That does not mean there are no lessons to be taken away from his first meeting with the Bills in October either

“That was a long time ago,” he said this week. “A lot of things have happened throughout this season that we kind of learned from. Even that game — we learned a lot from that game and we were like, ‘Damn, if we had this back, we would have done this differently. We would have done that differently.’ But all is well ends well when you win the game. You learn a lot throughout the season that’s going to help you towards the end.

“And the landscape looks different. It’s going to be a little more colder. It’s going to be some winter weather, whatever it is. I think the biggest thing for us is packing what our coach called identity and who we are, what we like to do and that’s finishing plays and that’s being aggressive and that’s being smart.”

LG Jared Wilson

The Patriots suffered some major losses during their win in Cincinnati in Week 12, including the entire left side of their offensive line. While tackle Will Campbell will be out another week on injured reserve due to the sprained MCL he sustained that day, guard Jared Wilson seems set to make a comeback against Buffalo.

Under normal circumstances, Wilson would slot into the left guard spot between Campbell’s replacement Vederian Lowe and center Garrett Bradbury. However, there is no telling just how quickly the third-round rookie will be up to speed again despite not carrying an injury designation into the matchup; even if he is cleared for starting action, there might be some rust to be shaken off after virtually not playing for three straight weekends both physically and in regards to his chemistry with Lowe in particular.

It helps that Buffalo will be without stalwart defensive tackle Ed Oliver. The remaining front seven — including starting tackles DaQuan Jones and Deone Walker as well as edges Joey Bosa and Greg Rousseau — will still present a challenge for the young lineman and the rest of the starting five.

DT Khyiris Tonga

Another player who recently missed some time, Tonga is set to make his own comeback after suffering an injury against Cincinnati. The Patriots will need him to be at his best, too, given Buffalo’s willingness to run the football as well as the scramble abilities provided by quarterback Josh Allen.

“He can do everything,” Tonga said about Allen this week. “Run the ball, throw the ball, throw 60 yards across his body — he can do it all. And we know that, so it’s going to be a fun challenge.”

With fellow defensive tackle Milton Williams on IR, Tonga projects as a starter alongside Christian Barmore (who himself was a limited participant in two of three practices this week). How much action he will actually see, however, has yet to be determined: Cory Durden, Eric Gregory and Joshua Farmer provide rotational depth behind the two top options, and likely will be moved in and out of the lineup as well. That said, at his peak, Tonga and Barmore is the best pairing New England has available against Allen and company.

LB Robert Spillane

The Bills offense presents an array of problems, and as a result no position might be under bigger pressure than linebacker. Tops among the LBs on the Patriots, of course, is team captain Robert Spillane.

Typically a 100-percenter on the defensive side of the ball — even though it remains to be seen whether his current foot injury will impact his availability — Spillane will be faced with a multitude of tasks. There is coming downhill to help stop James Cook and Buffalo’s potent run game; there is spying Josh Allen as a run threat; there is covering tight ends Dalton Kincaid and Dawson Knox; and there is communicating with the rest of the unit against a team using motion on 55.2% of snaps and play action on 16.5%.

K Andy Borregales

Whether or not you believe the Patriots’ underdog status is justified, Sunday’s game projects as a highly-contested affair that could be decided by a handful of points. If so, kicker Andy Borregales will again be in the spotlight.

The Titans (2-11) visit the 49ers (9-4) at Levi's Stadium (3:25 p.m. CT, FOX). McCaffrey is the engine the 49ers' offense is based around, as he's not only the NFL's third-leading rusher by attempts, but he's also the league's fifth-leading receiver by catches.

He's touched the football 322 times in 13 games, which works out to three more touches per game than any other player. Only Atlanta's Bijan Robinson and Indianapolis' Jonathan Taylor have gained more yards from scrimmage this season than McCaffrey.

Injuries have plagued McCaffrey throughout his career; he's only played one full season without missing a game since 2020. If McCaffrey is unable to go against the Titans, his likeliest replacement would be Brian Robinson Jr., who ran for 103 yards and a touchdown against the Titans in 2024 while playing for Washington.","https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/29/SNIN/87516276007-usatsi-27674286.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y120&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-13 20:00:46.997409

📰 Lineup News

CeeDee Lamb out of protocol, at practice

CeeDee Lamb navigated concussion protocol this week and should be fully operational for his team’s Sunday night home date with Minnesota.

Philip Rivers, a grandfather who’s spent the past five years coaching high school football, might actually be the starting quarterback for Indianapolis this weekend at Seattle. It’s an incredible story, if also a hopeless situation. Avoid any fringy Colts until further notice.

Tee Higgins has been ruled out for the Baltimore matchup Sunday after reentering concussion protocol. Mike Gesicki, Andrei Iosivas and Mitchell Tinsley could see upticks in usage, but think of them as DFS fliers, not reliable starters in traditional leagues.

Marvin Harrison isn’t ready to return from his heel injury just yet, so Michael Wilson gets the greenest possible green light, even in a challenging matchup with Houston.

Josh Jacobs reportedly experienced swelling in his knee this week. He was limited in practice yesterday following DNPs the prior two days, which is clearly a positive development.

De’Von Achane practiced Thursday and Friday (albeit in a non-contact jersey), so he should be good to go for Monday night’s trip to Pittsburgh.

Rome Odunze was limited in every practice session this week while dealing with a stress reaction in his foot and is officially questionable for tomorrow’s frigid game against Cleveland.

T.J. Watt won’t be available to face the Dolphins after suffering a partially collapsed lung during a dry needling treatment session. What a gruesome sentence that was. Downgrade Pittsburgh’s DST this week.

Lamar Jackson panic

We promise there was actually a time earlier this year when Lamar Jackson was one of the right answers in fantasy football. In fact, he was the season’s top per-game scorer among all quarterbacks just six weeks ago. Jackson had returned from a multi-week hamstring injury with a four-touchdown performance against Miami in which he completed nearly 80 percent of his throws. He looked like a potential league-winner.

Over Jackson’s past five games, however, he’s looked suspiciously like a guy determined to drag our fantasy teams into the consolation bracket. He added ankle and toe issues to the hamstring concern, and he only occasionally gets in full practice sessions. Jackson has thrown two touchdown passes and four picks since the start of November, averaging a modest 197.4 passing yards per game. He also hasn’t rushed for 50 yards in any week since the season opener. Not great.

Jackson has slowed down both figuratively and literally:

On the other hand, Jackson has been victimized by a remarkable series of near-TDs and negated scores over his past two games — drops, goal-line fumbles, phantom OPI penalties and replay overrules have taken points off the board for Baltimore. It’s been an outrageously unlucky ride.

Matchups don’t get much better than what’s on deck for Jackson this week in Cincinnati. So far this season, the Bengals defense has given up the third-most fantasy points per game to opposing quarterbacks. Cincinnati ranks next-to-last in the league in passing yards allowed (254.9 YPG) and last in passing touchdowns (29). This is a defense that’s allowed multi-touchdown games to fantasy luminaries such as Trevor Lawrence, Carson Wentz and Caleb Williams.

Realistically, you can’t sit a quarterback with Jackson’s ceiling in a get-right spot like this. You are certainly allowed to worry, however. Over to Jake Ciely for more:

💬 Jake’s take

Heading into the Steelers matchup last week, I would have said my level of Lamar concern was extremely elevated. After? It’s moderately minimal. OK, I’ll avoid more annoying alliteration. I had Jackson as a low-end QB1 last week because we hadn’t seen a healthy (or even close) version capable of running with ease. He wasn’t 100 percent against Pittsburgh, but he was close to it. Jackson looked better than he had in some time.

The worry isn’t eliminated, however. While this should be a good week, the Patriots and Packers aren’t great matchups in Weeks 16-17 — particularly if Jackson is playing at 80-90 percent. He lost his top-three weekly set-it-and-forget-it status. If he tweaks this injury at any point, I’d consider benching him again. But let’s hope our Christmas present is a healthy Jackson and top-five playoff returns.

Last-minute moves

Jake Ciely has devoted his professional life to ranking a vast array of objects and people. At this point, if Jake hasn’t ranked something or someone, then it seems fair to question its cultural relevance. Let’s review a few names that landed in unusual spots in Jake’s Week 15 fantasy rankings:

Jared Goff is attached to the game with the highest projected total (54.5) in Week 15, so Jake is understandably not sweating the matchup with the Rams defense. Goff lands at QB9, three spots ahead of industry consensus.

Omarion Hampton and Kimani Vidal are nowhere near each other on Ciely’s board this week, landing at RB24 and RB41, respectively. Both backs were effective against Philadelphia last Monday, but Hampton is the one who broke the plane.

Stefon Diggs tortured his former team in the first meeting this season at Buffalo (10 for 146), and a repeat performance seems entirely possible. Jake got aggressive with Diggs, slotting him four spots ahead of consensus at WR19.

Matchups to embrace 🤗 and avoid 😨

Each week, KC Joyner delivers a thorough preview of the best and worst matchups on the upcoming slate. Below is a sampling of notable names for Week 15.

Start with confidence

QB Jaxson Dart, RB Tyrone Tracy and WR Darius Slayton (vs. WAS), QB Brock Purdy (vs. TEN), QB Shedeur Sanders (at CHI), RB Kenneth Walker (vs. IND), WR Chimere Dike (at SF), TE Mark Andrews (at CIN)

Exercise caution

QB Bo Nix, WR Troy Franklin and TE Evan Engram (vs. GB), QB Caleb Williams (vs. CLE), RB Breece Hall (at JAX), WR Michael Pittman (at SEA), TE Jake Ferguson (vs. MIN)

On the cut line 🔪

Fantasy analysts are more than happy to give you long lists of must-add fantasy options, but we aren’t quite as forthcoming with drop recommendations. Let the record show that you have our official permission to discard any of the following players:

Jayden Daniels seemed like a great idea this time last week, but, um … no. Washington chose to start him against the Vikings even though his left elbow was apparently not sufficiently recovered to tolerate standard-issue contact with the turf. Daniels won’t play this week, and it’s difficult to imagine why the team would put him at risk again this season. He cannot be started in fantasy until 2026.

DJ Moore appeared to have a massive opportunity last week at Green Bay, with Odunze sidelined by injury. Alas, Moore saw only three targets in the loss, two of which resulted in him being absolutely obliterated. He finished with -4 receiving yards, which is not ideal. He’s well outside the circle of fantasy trust at the moment, unplayable and thus droppable.

Isiah Pacheco is finishing the 2025 season just as he did last year, running as the clear No. 2 in Kansas City’s backfield behind Kareem Hunt. Pacheco isn’t a volume receiver, and he doesn’t see the goal line carries, so he has no obvious path to fantasy value at the moment. He remains rostered in 50 percent of Sleeper leagues (60 percent at ESPN), but he’s done nothing recently to earn his spot on your squad.

Sleeper of the week 💤

Isaiah Likely has drawn a dozen targets and delivered 120 receiving yards over Baltimore’s past two games, and he’s now headed into a matchup with Cincinnati’s defense, a unit that’s been historically generous to opposing tight ends. The Bengals have allowed 15 touchdowns to the position, an almost incomprehensible total. Not surprisingly, Cincy has also given up the most receptions (97) and receiving yards (1,258) to tight ends. If you’ve been streaming the position, Likely is your clear priority this week.

💬 From the Discord

At any given moment, there’s a good chance one of The Athletic’s writers is conducting an AMA in our fantasy football Discord server. No reasonable question is ever refused. Here’s a loaded question from Thursday’s chat:

Agwoq: With [Tee] Higgins most likely out, it is desperation time. 0.5 PPR, 1 Flex spot — Addison, Flournoy, Pearsall, Monangai, Vidal, Charbonnet or an absolute insanity move with Likely? All seem relatively similar. Leaning towards Addison, but none fill me with any confidence.

First of all, Likely would be a perfectly sane move in a week in which he faces the greatest possible matchup in the history of his position. (See above.) Zach Charbonnet, however, is the play for me. Seattle is a 13.5-point favorite at home against the Daniel Jones-less Colts, a reeling team making wild late-season personnel decisions. Charbonnet has made eight house calls on the season, and he’s averaging a respectable 11.9 touches per game. He offers both floor and ceiling.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/12173817/USATSI_27741650-1-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-13 19:00:53.954576

Jennings entered concussion protocol after the Patriots’ Week 13 win over the New York Giants. However, even with the Week 14 bye, he was unable to get cleared to play. The Patriots initially ruled him out on Friday.

Rapoport noted that Jennings should be back for the playoffs after missing four games. Jennings has just 23 carries this season for 73 yards. He has scored a touchdown as well. In the passing game, he has one catch for nine yards.

Jennings is in his second year, but has been stuck behind TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson on the depth chart. He saw more work when Stevenson was hurt, but has since gone back to being the third running back.

He has played 51 special teams snaps, so perhaps that’s where the Patriots will be losing the biggest impact. According to Rapoport, the Patriots plan to sign D’Ernest Johnson to the active roster this week.

“There are a few scenarios that we’ve been talking through over the last couple of days,” interim head coach Mike Kafka said.

Thibodeaux was optimistic before the bye that he would return for the final four games. Make that three games (at best) now.

“There’s still a ton of optimism,” Kafka said. “I think he’s fired up and preparing himself to get out there with the players. It’s just about when he feels comfortable and when the doctors feel really good to clear him.”

The Giants claimed WR Ryan Miller off waivers from the Buccaneers. He played 123 offensive snaps and 205 special-teams snaps.

The New Orleans Saints have long been out of the running for the NFC South. But they still have a chance to impact the race. Heck, they already have. New Orleans' win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last weekend threw a wrench into what surprisingly has been a competitive division. The loss moved Tampa Bay into a tie for first with the Carolina Panthers, who just so happen to be the team the Saints host Sunday at the Caesars Superdome. SEE MORE>>

Whitney Paul, a former New Orleans Saints linebacker from 1982-85, died on Dec. 3 in Houston, Texas. He was 72. Paul, who crafted an 11-year NFL career that began as a 10th-round draft pick by the Chiefs (No. 277 overall) in 1976, made his way via trade to New Orleans in 1982, and concluded with Kansas City in 1986. It wasn't until after New Orleans Saints defensive lineman Jim Wilks and linebacker Whitney Paul finished playing in the NFL, and reconnected in Houston as retirees, that Wilks learned his former teammate was a star track and field athlete in high school.

Look, Hallett’s been taking reps, (Thomas) DT’s been taking reps, Maddox has been taking reps. We’ve got plenty of guys.","On Saturday, ahead of traveling to the West Coast for a Week 15 matchup with the Los Angeles Rams, the Detroit Lions announced that they have downgraded two players to OUT: safety Thomas Harper (concussion) and Christian Mahogany (fibula).

With Brian Branch likely headed to injured reserve later on Saturday (transactions are typically announced at 4 pm ET), and Kerby Joseph already ruled out, the Lions were hopeful that Harper would be available to start alongside Anthony Maddox against the Rams. Unfortunately, it appears Harper was unable to clear the NFL’s concussion protocols, despite practicing all three days this past week. Returning to practice is a key component in progressing through the NFL’s protocols. However, players in the protocol still need to be medically cleared, and it can be assumed that Harper did not pass the independent medical testing.

With the Lions’ top three safeties unavailable, there is no clear frontrunner to start alongside Maddox on Sunday. Veteran Daniel Thomas looks like he could be the next man up, but he is primarily a special teamer and may not be the preferred option. The Lions also claimed Jalen Mills off waivers this week, but with only a few days of practice, he seems unlikely to be ready to step into a starting role.

The most likely candidate to challenge Thomas for the starting role is Erick Hallett. While currently on the practice squad, Hallett could be a candidate for roster elevation, as he has already started one game for the Lions this season (against the Buccaneers in Week 7). He was also the first name Lions coach Dan Campbell mentioned when discussing the options at safety this week.

“We’ll be good. Look, Hallett’s been taking reps, (Thomas) DT’s been taking reps, Maddox has been taking reps. We’ve got plenty of guys. They’re getting valuable reps, so we’re good,” Campbell said on Friday.

Mahogany started his injury evaluation clock this week, and while the Lions initially left the door open for him to return to the active roster for this game, he’s not quite ready and was downgraded to out, keeping him on injured reserve. With two weeks remaining in his evaluation window, Mahogany still has a lot of time to rehabilitate. That being said, he appeared to be close to returning for this game, meaning he will likely have a good chance of returning in Week 16 against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Look for the Lions to ask Kayode Awosika to start at left guard this week. However, if his foot injury keeps him from that role, the Lions could turn back to veteran Trystan Colon, who started at left guard last week. We could also see rookie Miles Frazier get some pre-planned reps, regardless of who starts, as coaches are looking to get him more experience.",https://platform.prideofdetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/127/2025/12/imagn-27742320.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.727820977519%2C100%2C78.544358044962&w=1200,N,,2025-12-13 17:00:27.425073

Don't speak this into existence. Even as someone who loathes having to face Burrow twice a year (at least), he's incredible and the league is a better place with him in it.

He's putting pressure on the FO and the people who need to make those decisions because he hopefully has the power to affect real change within the organization.

The problem is that the team will always be hamstrung by their ownership. For all we know the scouting department could have been begging for more staff to adequately prepare for drafts and reporting, and isn't getting support either.

I asked one of the smartest NFL offensive coordinators what he would do to help Rivers against the Seahawks.
Daniel Jones worked out of shotgun 78.5 percent of the time this season, ranking 20th in the league.
The majority of NFL officials have primary jobs outside of the NFL.","The eyes of the NFL world will be in Seattle on Sunday afternoon to watch Old Man Rivers against one of the best defenses in the league.

The expectation is that the Indianapolis Colts will activate the 44-year-old Philip Rivers from the practice squad Saturday to be their starter, granting us one of the most improbable and unlikely comebacks in modern NFL history -- the cherry on top of one of the best slates you could ask for. The Colts have not officially named Rivers the starter, and Riley Leonard (knee) was a full participant at practice all week.

Sunday vs. the Seahawks (4:25 ET, CBS) will mark 1,800 days exactly since Rivers' last NFL game, which will be the longest layoff by a quarterback 40 years or older in league history. While many around the league have privately joked about this comeback, and others have issued worries about the spot Rivers is putting himself in, the quarterback has said he's not naïve to the challenges ahead on Sunday against the league's second-ranked defense in Seattle.

""I know that there's risk involved, obviously, on what may or may not happen,"" Rivers said. ""But the only way to find out is going for it. I just felt almost like it was a gift, another opportunity to play and cut it loose with the guys and the game you love to play and the dream that you got to live. You may get some bonus time.""

There is no good comparison in the modern NFL for what Rivers is going to attempt. Steve DeBerg played in 1998 at 44 years old after a four-year layoff, but he didn't start in a game until late in the year and had been with the Falcons all training camp and season long.

When Joe Flacco came off the couch for the Browns in 2023, he was 38 years old and had played the previous year with the Jets. Flacco also still had a great arm, something that Rivers has never really possessed.

I asked one of the smartest NFL offensive coordinators what he would do to help Rivers against the Seahawks.

""Quick game!,"" he said. ""Honestly, you got to be able to establish run game and then passes need to really have thoroughly thought out hot outlets so he can get the ball out.

""Mike Macdonald is going to have some fun packages to watch.""

I then turned to one of the best defensive coaches in the league for how he would plan for Rivers if he ran the Seattle defense.

""I am heavy disguise with two pressures at least he hasn't seen on tape,"" the coach said. ""I'm base defense against 11 personnel early and I'm simulating pressure on second and pass.""

Both Seattle's theoretical plan of attack and Rivers' own plan are predicated on his lack of mobility. When he takes the field Sunday he will instantly be the least mobile quarterback in the league.

His average speed of 3.02 mph/play in 2020 was fourth slowest in the league behind Tom Brady, Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees. Today, he would rank second behind only Mac Jones (3.01 mph), but this is five years later with three practices under his belt.

It is unlikely Rivers will be able to do much from under center, either. In 2020 with the Colts he was in shotgun 90.1 percent of the time, third-highest in the league then. Daniel Jones worked out of shotgun 78.5 percent of the time this season, ranking 20th in the league.

It's possible Rivers looks about as mobile as he did in the 2007 AFC Championship Game when he played on a torn ACL. Of course, he was 26 then.

What's clear is that Colts head coach Shane Steichen will have to do things differently for Rivers than he was with Jones, who had five rushing touchdowns.

Saturday's expected elevation will also remove Rivers from consideration for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026 and push his eligibility window out five more years. Rivers would not have gotten into the Hall on this ballot, and it's possible he will always be on the outside looking in with zero All Pros and no Super Bowl appearances.

But if he can somehow defy the odds and get the Colts into the playoffs, Rivers may get his second NFL Comeback Player of the Year award and add enough to his legacy that his Hall candidacy in the 2030s is stronger than it is today.

Who is Daniel Jones playing for in 2026?

If Rivers is the Colts present, Indy's future remains a question. Daniel Jones' Achilles injury means he won't be cleared for contact at a practice until June workouts at the absolute earliest, and likely not until some point during training camp.

Jones is on a one-year contract, meaning the Colts or another team will have to sign him this spring just over three months removed from Achilles surgery. Who is going to do that? And what will his price be?

The second question is hard to answer. It was already difficult to nail down before the injury, considering his level of play through the first half of the season, then the slight decline, along with his history of signing a major deal just to watch everything around him crumble. But with this injury? The second season-ender of his career? That's a difficult projection before Christmas.

The Colts will have the franchise tag at their disposal when it comes to Jones. Indianapolis will surely want Jones back, but it's possible the two sides won't be able to agree to terms. The way Indy ensures it keeps Jones on the team is by using the tag, which will be upwards of $40 million next year. That's a big number for a player coming off a serious injury, and there's no way to anticipate whether Indianapolis would issue the tag now when their doctors would need to fully evaluate Jones months after surgery.

And though much younger than Kirk Cousins and Aaron Rodgers when they had their injuries, might there be some hesitation in a team putting their 2026 eggs in the Jones basket coming off Achilles surgery?

I think what's clear is Jones will want the best situation for himself, from contract to front office to coach to roster. That very well could be in Indy with either the tag or a contract. If the Colts don't tag him, it's possible he becomes a free agent. The best situation may present itself somewhere outside of Indianapolis, in that case. Multiple sources have pointed to Minnesota as being a potential landing spot.

Jones picked the Vikings after his release from the Giants, and J.J. McCarthy has played so poorly it is clear Minnesota will need some quarterback insurance next year regardless of how he finishes the year.

The Colts have plenty to figure out these next few weeks. And Jones has plenty to work through these next few months. But unless the Colts are willing to issue the franchise tag, I don't see it as a slam dunk that Jones is back with Indy next year.

Let's hope we don't get 'Replacement Refs' 2.0

Something that flew a bit under the radar this week was the NFL informing team owners that its talks with the NFL Referees Association toward a new collective bargaining agreement have been ""unsuccessful."" This could wind up being a big deal!

The CBA for officials expires at the end of May, and if talks are unsuccessful in December, I don't know why anyone would feel enthused about minds being changed come the offseason when there's no deadline pressure with games three-plus months away.

To recap, the league wants to reward high-performing officials with more year-end bonus money, wants to get rid of seniority considerations when giving out postseason assignments, wants mandatory training for low-performing officials, wants to extend a probationary period that removes underperforming officials, wants to shrink the dead period that's currently from the Super Bowl to May 15 and wants to increase its ""practice squad"" of officials.

All of these things sound great, of course. And the refs union has decided to keep its wishes private. But you can imagine the union wants more money and fewer performance penalties for officials, at the very least.

While the NFL is the biggest thing going and usually gets its way, what is unique about this is we have seen officials be willing to strike before. The start of the 2012 season was a debacle with replacement officials, and that was when the league was pulling in half the money it does today. Throw in the fact that legalized sports gambling has taken over the country and the idea of these games being placed in the hands of below-standard officials is inconceivable.

And the NFL doesn't wield the sort of power over officials that it does over players. Players are, generally speaking, unwilling to have a work stoppage because that means their primary source of income, which can only be made in a finite amount of time, no longer comes in. The majority of NFL officials have primary jobs outside of the NFL. They can financially stomach a work stoppage much more easily than players could.

I did find there to be some irony in the NFL informing owners of these unsuccessful talks during a virtual league meeting that went virtual this year in part to cut costs. And then one day later, officials flagged the Falcons for the most penalties in a game in nine years.

The long and short is the NFL doesn't have its typical high ground in negotiations when it comes to the refs union, and I think that union knows it.

What sources say about Burrow's cryptic comments

Joe Burrow raised just about every eyebrow across the league this week with his comments about how much fun he's having and his future.

""If I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it. I've been through a lot, and if it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That's the mindset I'm trying to bring to the table,"" Burrow said.

""There's a lot of things going on right now,"" the QB added. And when asked if his frustrations are related to football or more personal, Burrow said ""all of the above.""

Because Burrow has a history of sending messages in the media, and because of Cincinnati's history with unhappy players, many took Burrow's comments to signal he may either want out of the Bengals organization or out of football entirely. Carson Palmer ultimately won his freedom from Cincinnati, and it does not seem like it's really been six years since Andrew Luck called it quits at Burrow's current age (he turned 29 this week).

But pump the brakes. I talked with a couple of sources on this who didn't think we are anywhere close to the above scenarios. ""Blown out"" of proportion, said one source. ""Crazy.""

""He was emotional on his birthday and pissed that for as much as he's worked, he's still not able to win. That's all he wants to do. ... If he cannot win he's miserable.""

Burrow's long injury history is well documented, and the Bengals are on the brink of missing the playoffs for the fourth time in Burrow's six years. But he has another four years left on the largest contract in team history, and I don't get the sense that there's any panic inside the building about his long-term future with that organization.

Panthers enter biggest 3-game stretch in 10 years

Much like William Carlos Williams' red wheelbarrow, so much of the Panthers' playoff hopes depends upon beating the Saints in New Orleans on Sunday. The 7-6 Panthers just took sole possession of first place in the NFC South after Atlanta's comeback win against the Buccaneers. The franchise has not made the playoffs since 2017, and it has not hosted a playoff game since 2015.

If Carolina beats New Orleans on Sunday and can beat Tampa Bay next week, the Panthers will have locked up the division. Carolina can lose to Tampa in Week 16 but beat them in Week 18 and win the division, too.

This is the latest in a season Carolina has been at the top of the division since its Super Bowl run in 2015. Very few of the current players have been in the position they currently are, and this is where coaching comes into play.

Dave Canales has a coaching staff that has playoff experience. He won a ring with Seattle, and OC Brad Idzik joined in late playoff success with the Seahawks. DC Ejiro Evero won a Super Bowl with the Rams and went to others. There are other rings on the staff, as well as two Triple OGs in Jim Caldwell and Dom Capers.

As one source put it, there's a ""numbing sense"" where things within a playoff team's building should not and do not change, where players ignore the noise and stay focused on maintaining the process. A huge few weeks in Charlotte.

This week's unlikely QB story: Brady Cook

Do not sleep on Brady Cook this week against the Jaguars. The undrafted rookie quarterback out of Missouri will be the league's 51st starting quarterback* this season when he takes the first snap for the Jets on Sunday with Tyrod Taylor and Justin Fields both out.

I'm told Cook ""has been giving the defense fits"" at practice the last few weeks. He doesn't have the biggest arm, but he's a great processor and the offense can rally around him. Cook faces a difficult task against the Jags defense, but a good showing will reflect well on him and his prospects with Gang Green as a backup in 2026.

Cook was a three-year starter at Mizzou and left as one of the most decorated passers in school history -- second only to Chase Daniel in wins and No. 3 in passing yards. Jets fans remember Brad Smith, the do-it-all former QB from the late aughts. Cook joined Smith, Daniel and Drew Lock as Mizzou players to amass over 10,000 yards in their career.

* — Cook could be the 52nd starting quarterback this season depending on who takes the field first between himself and Raiders starter Kenny Pickett. Both are playing in 1 p.m. ET kickoffs, so we'll know who gets the coveted 51st slot then.

NFL's next McVay hasn't turned 30 yet

It would be crazy to interview a 30-year-old for an NFL head coaching job, right? Right?

Jacksonville Jaguars offensive coordinator Grant Udinski is a name you'll probably be hearing a lot more of in the coming weeks. Udinski turns 30 in January, he's the non-play-calling OC of the AFC South-leading Jags, and he may be interviewing for head coaching gigs in about five weeks from now.

Udinski got into the league in 2020 when he followed Matt Rhule to Carolina from Baylor. Since then, he has worked his way up the offensive coaching ladder, spending three years in Minnesota before joining Liam Coen's inaugural staff in Jacksonville. He contributed to some of the best years of Kirk Cousins' career, then the best year of Sam Darnold's career and a resurgence in Trevor Lawrence's career this season.

I am not saying Udinski gets a head coaching gig. He'd be almost 11 months younger than Sean McVay when he took the Rams job. But the Jaguars can block teams from interviewing Udinski for a play-calling OC role, so the only way for a team to ensure they can get him in their building for a chat is to interview him for the vacant head coaching position. Teams interviewing folks for elevated positions only hoping to eventually hire them elsewhere in the organization has happened plenty in recent years even though it is not supposed to.

At the very least, teams may want to try to pick the brain of the young, bright offensive star.

Belichick shuffles UNC staff, including Kitchens

Bill Belichick began dismantling his UNC coaching staff this week as he hopes to improve on what was a bad year on the field and perhaps a more embarrassing year off the field for the program. I have said for months now that the team didn't have much of a chance due to the lack of talent -- its roster ranked in the 30s, per 247Sports -- and that showed with just two victories against Power Four opponents.

While no one who watched Carolina play this season is surprised to see offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens won't be with the team in 2026, I point to the above lack of talent and more. Kitchens had three preventative heart surgeries in 11 days last year, I'm told, which had been anticipated after his initial heart issue arose in 2013. So it was a difficult start to the season personally for him along with getting 70 new players on the team acclimated to the scheme.

The former Browns head coach in 2019, Kitchens has been in the college ranks since 2021. He's fully healthy now, and I think he will be in the mix for both college and pro jobs as these cycles continue in the coming weeks.

I don't see Gruden landing Michigan job

One other pro/college coaching note: a name I have seen floated around for the vacant Michigan job is Jon Gruden. I truly do not know if Gruden will coach again this upcoming year or beyond, and it's possible that question won't be answered until his lawsuit against the NFL reaches a conclusion. But I do not see Gruden to Michigan as a possibility in Ann Arbor, according to multiple sources.

Food for thought if MVP becomes two-man race

With four weeks left in the season, I wouldn't shut down the MVP race just yet, but it's clearly shaping up to be a two-horse race between Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye. There will be plenty of metrics to help decide who should get the award at the end of the year, but one thing I would caution others (including voters) against when considering who should win:

Stafford is set to play three of his next four games in national windows, meaning his games against the Lions, Seahawks and Falcons will go to 100% of the country. Meanwhile, Maye is coming off a bye and has only next Sunday night's game against the Ravens going to the entire country.

All of these games are big for these two teams, which are each vying for their conference's top seed. It shouldn't matter that they played well in a game going nationwide. It should matter that they played well in the game, whether it goes to 7 percent of the country or the world.

I also won't hold against one or both of these guys if they sit the final game of the season because they have already locked up the No. 1 seed. Accomplishing the mission in 16 games is fantastic and should not be considered a detriment to one's end-of-season awards when it comes to total QB statistics.

Ravens doing flurry of deals; Broncos next?

Last week I wrote in this space about how some teams are trying to get in front of the potential spike in the salary cap by getting deals done at the end of this season versus waiting until the spring. Very clearly the Ravens are one of those teams.

After getting Mark Andrews' deal done, Baltimore inked Travis Jones to an extension this past week. We will see if they can get across the finish line with Tyler Linderbaum, who has been another extension target for the team.

Another team to look for is the Denver Broncos. Quarterback Bo Nix will be on his rookie deal for at least one more year, and GM George Paton is looking to make some deals before the end of this year, I'm told.

Higgins' injury puts NFL concussion protocol under scrutiny

Tee Higgins will miss Sunday's game against the Ravens after suffering his second concussion of the season this past week against the Bills, and it's bad optics for the league's concussion protocol.

The NFL has worked intensely on strengthening its concussion protocol. According to a joint review of the process by the league and the players union, it appears all steps were followed last week when Higgins was checked twice for a concussion during the game. It was not until after the game, as part of the protocol process, where Higgins reported symptoms and was officially placed in protocol.

This came two weeks after Higgins suffered a concussion, and against the Bills he appeared to hit his head in a similar way that had resulted in the previous head injury. I'm no doctor, but it was surprising to see Higgins stay in the game after the first head hit. It was stunning to see him stay in the game after the second.

The return-to-play protocol is the same for any player regardless of being concussed once or twice, and it's a slippery slope to change any rules because of how things may ""appear."" But as someone who has covered concussions in the NFL for several years now, Sunday's events seemed like a gap in the protocol armor that needs to be addressed.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/13/1c5480ad-be47-4f2d-8086-47842e022638/thumbnail/1200x675/3aa37f078f201470f74bc79786242f98/philrivers.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 15:01:44.440384

Dry needling isn't unusual during an NFL player's physical therapy, but a significant incident like this is uncommon.
In Watt's situation, according to his brother JJ, he suffered a partially collapsed lung (also a pneumothorax) after a dry needling treatment session.","PITTSBURGH -- Steelers star T.J. Watt, one of the highest-paid edge rushers in the NFL and the 2021 AP Defensive Player of the Year, suffered a partially collapsed lung during a Wednesday dry needling treatment at the team facility, prompting questions about the events that led to the incident and what will happen next.

J.J. Watt, T.J.'s brother, said in a social media statement Friday that T.J. had surgery Thursday to repair and stabilize his lung and was released from the hospital Friday.

""Yesterday TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility,"" J.J. Watt wrote on social media. ""Recovery timeline is still TBD, but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today. He and his family are very appreciative of everyone's kind words and well wishes.""

T.J. Watt, 31, will not play in Monday's home prime-time matchup against the Miami Dolphins (8:15 ET, ESPN), Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said, as Pittsburgh seeks to bolster its AFC North lead over the Baltimore Ravens.

The Steelers haven't provided many details surrounding the incident. The initial statement released by Pittsburgh spokesperson Burt Lauten on Thursday said Watt went to the hospital for further evaluation of his lung after experiencing ""discomfort"" at the practice facility Wednesday. After Friday's practice, Tomlin said Watt had a ""medical procedure today or yesterday."" And when asked if the incident that led to Watt's hospitalization occurred during a dry needling session, as J.J. Watt said, Tomlin continued to be vague.

""I don't have a lot of information, so I'm certainly not going to dispute something that's said by someone close to him,"" Tomlin said. ""I hadn't had discussions along those lines.""

The NFL Players Association is aware of the situation and has been in touch with Watt and his representation. ""Our main immediate priority is supporting T.J.'s health and full recovery,"" the NFLPA said in a statement.

Dry needling isn't unusual during an NFL player's physical therapy, but a significant incident like this is uncommon.

Did Watt have an injury before the treatment? What is dry needling? Is Watt's situation similar to then-Chargers quarterback Tyrod Taylor's situation in 2020, when he suffered a punctured lung? How will Pittsburgh's defense step up as the team chases a divisional title? Steelers reporter Brooke Pryor and ESPN senior writer and injury analyst Stephania Bell break down the biggest questions.

Did Watt have a chest or back injury before the dry needling?

Watt has not been listed on the team practice or injury report this season. Tomlin also said Thursday that, to his knowledge, Watt didn't have an injury that was worthy of being on an injury report or after the Steelers' Week 14 game.

Watt was on the practice report because of a toe injury during the week leading up to the game at Baltimore, and earlier in the season, he was listed on the practice report because of a hip issue leading up to the Week 8 home game against the Green Bay Packers. Dry needling isn't necessarily associated as a treatment for a specific injury, and it can be used to alleviate general muscle tightness, including around the shoulders, and in some cases, the pectoral muscles. -- Pryor

What is dry needling? What is required to legally administer dry needling? How safe is it?

Dry needling is a skilled intervention where the provider uses a thin needle to penetrate the skin with the goal of alleviating pain and improving movement. Unlike ""wet"" needling, which utilizes a hollow bore needle (which has a central channel to allow liquid to pass through it) to inject a medication, dry needling utilizes a solid needle and no substance is injected.

Common applications for dry needling include, but aren't limited to, muscle pain/strains (e.g., hamstring, quad), tendinitis/tendinopathy (e.g., patellofemoral, biceps, rotator cuff), plantar fasciitis and headaches. Utilization has expanded within the past decade, in particular, and it is not uncommon to see dry needling in most athletic rehabilitation settings or training rooms.

Requirements vary by state as to who may legally perform dry needling. The range of practitioners engaging in dry needling may include physical therapists, athletic trainers, acupuncturists, chiropractors, physicians, physician assistants, nurses and nurse practitioners.

Health care professionals typically undergo post-graduate education specific to dry needling procedures. The requirements vary by state as to requisite hours of training as there is no nationally recognized board that oversees dry needling certification. Programs require completion of didactic and practical elements, and participants must pass written and practical exams that incorporate safety components.

Dr. Sue Falsone, president and founder of Structure and Function Education, is a physical therapist, athletic trainer and certified strength and conditioning specialist who has over 15 years of experience practicing and teaching dry needling. She has treated and consulted with numerous elite athletes, including NFL and MLB players, and says there are numerous safety studies that have been published showing very low risk with dry needling.

""Precautions and patient safety are always a part of any patient intervention,"" Falsone said, ""but as with any modality, there is a chance for an adverse reaction.""

Falsone noted that the four most common adverse reactions consistently documented in the scientific literature are relatively benign. They include bleeding (noted as a drop or two of blood at the needle site), localized bruising, pain or residual soreness at the needle site and pain or soreness away from the site.

""Pneumothorax [punctured lung] is reported in the literature as a very rare event,"" Falsone said. -- Bell

How many other Steelers do dry needling?

It's hard to say how many Steelers players seek dry needling to treat tight muscles and soreness during the season, but former linebacker James Harrison told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler in 2015 that ""three to five"" other players in the locker room were also doing dry needling.

""It's a more invasive form of needling,"" Harrison said then. ""It can be recovery-based and help to heal any injuries that are nagging. ... It's painful as hell.""

Steelers inside linebacker Patrick Queen said Friday that he prefers to use acupuncture over dry needling.

""Kind of two different things,"" Queen said. ""... I don't do the whole dry needle thing. I'm actually scared of dry needling, so I kind of stay away from that stuff.

""It is unfortunate. You could probably get dry needled a thousand times and never have anything happen, and it just probably a half an inch in the wrong direction. So, you never know.""

Queen added that he has always been cautious about whom he permits to use needles on him in treatment.

""Obviously, it's needles, then you need 'em in the right spot and stuff, and they could go in the wrong spot at any time,"" he said. -- Pryor

What should be the typical prognosis for Watt? Will there be any long-term effects?

The most critical aspect of Watt's case is that once he reported symptoms and was evaluated, he was sent to the hospital for care emergently and treated promptly by the appropriate personnel. This gives him an excellent chance of full recovery.

Lung tissue is remarkably resilient, especially in a young, healthy athlete. A lung injury like Watt's has the potential to heal within 7-10 days, and there should be no long-term effects. -- Bell

Is this like the Tyrod Taylor situation? What are the differences?

Taylor was reportedly dealing with two cracked ribs and received a pregame pain-relieving injection, the intent of which was to decrease localized pain and allow him to compete on game day. The needle punctured a lung, and the result was a pneumothorax (where air leaks into the space between the lung and the chest wall, putting pressure on or ""collapsing"" the lung).

In Watt's situation, according to his brother JJ, he suffered a partially collapsed lung (also a pneumothorax) after a dry needling treatment session. By definition, dry needling means no medication was being delivered via the needle, making this different from Taylor's specific procedure.

While we do not have access to the specifics of either player's medical records, it is worth noting that every player's injury severity and recovery experience is unique, even in the presence of the same diagnosis. We do know that Taylor has since gone on to return to football at the NFL level and expect Watt to do the same. -- Bell

What does Watt's absence mean for the Steelers' defense in their quest to win the AFC North?

There's no firm timeline on Watt's return, and that's a significant hit for a team that has a slim lead over the Ravens for the AFC North and a coveted playoff spot with four games remaining.

The Steelers are 1-11 all time, including the playoffs, when Watt doesn't play. Watt last missed a game in the 2023 playoffs, when he was sidelined because of an MCL sprain for the wild-card loss to the Buffalo Bills in January 2024.

This time without Watt, the Steelers will rely on a rotation of Alex Highsmith, Nick Herbig and rookie Jack Sawyer. Highsmith, who has dealt with injuries throughout this season, sealed the win against the Ravens with a walk-off sack of Lamar Jackson.

""That's a clear representation of who he is, the type of plays he provides, the type of splash he makes, game on the line, he'll go make a play for us,"" Herbig said of Highsmith. ""That's who Alex is. That's who he's been his whole career.""

Herbig is also another young player on the rise. The 2023 fourth-round pick recorded two sacks the last time he faced a left-handed quarterback in Cleveland's Dillion Gabriel; Herbig had two tackles for loss and four quarterback hits. Herbig faces Miami's left-handed QB Tua Tagovailoa on Monday.

""T.J.'s done a great job of being a leader, not just in the room, but in the whole building, the organization,"" Herbig said. ""I think he rubs off on a lot of people in the right way, and I'm not worried at all because we have great guys, great leaders that'll pick up that slack, and I think that he's prepared, not just myself, but a bunch of the younger guys in that sense to be able to take on that larger role, not just as a player but as a leader, and bringing that energy and just doing everything that he does."" -- Pryor",https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1213%2Fr1588703_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 13:00:32.231529

If Bateman can't play Sunday, that would open up more opportunities for veteran DeAndre Hopkins and second-year speedster Devontez Walker. Harbaugh and Offensive Coordinator Todd Monken have said this week that they want to get Hopkins more involved.

Tight end Mark Andrews, who also popped up on Thursday's report with a glute injury, was back on the field Friday and is set to play.

Ravens outside linebacker Tavius Robinson (foot) and safety Ar'Darius Washington (Achilles) are questionable and would need to be activated to the 53-man roster on Saturday to play. The Ravens currently only have 51 players on the roster, so there's room for them to move up without making a cut.

Robinson has missed the past seven games due to a foot injury and Washington could make his season debut after suffering an Achilles injury in May.

""I think they've looked good,"" Harbaugh said. ""We will talk to the trainers and things like that – the docs – but they've looked good to me.""

Because, I mean, there was no reason to take (an) inconsiderate risk two days after my injury.” Wembanyama accepted the advice, but he’s been pushing for clearance for quite some time.
The Spurs beat the Los Angeles Lakers in Wednesday’s NBA Cup quarterfinal to advance to Las Vegas.
Wembanyama suffered the injury during the Spurs’ game against the Golden State Warriors.","After nearly a month sidelined by a left calf strain, Victor Wembanyama is expected to return for the San Antonio Spurs in Saturday’s NBA Cup semifinal in Las Vegas against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Wembanyama was listed as probable on Friday’s Spurs injury report, but he pronounced himself “ready to go” while talking to reporters on Friday night.

“I’m feeling great,” Wembanyama said during media availability.

Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said he expects Wembanyama to play, adding that the center will be on a minutes restriction, and he anticipates subbing him out of the game early.

Wembanyama felt he and the Spurs staff undertook the right process to get him back on the floor, acknowledging that he may be a little tired from the conditioning work he is still doing to ramp up ahead of Saturday’s game.

“It’s a lot of trust that comes into play both ways. I know I have a chance to be around the best staff in the world, so I trust them very much,” he said. “I have the chance, also, that they trust me because I’ve shown them I know my body and I give them good feedback.”

Johnson acknowledged that Wembanyama was lobbying to play from the day he suffered the injury on Nov. 14, trying to get into a game in Sacramento two days later. The Spurs shut him down and stated they would be abundantly cautious with Wembanyama, which was not easy for him to accept.

“But it’s true if it was only me, I would have came back earlier,” Wembanyama said. “But I think it’s more reasonable to do it (this) way, to listen to them and do as they said. Because, I mean, there was no reason to take (an) inconsiderate risk two days after my injury.”

Wembanyama accepted the advice, but he’s been pushing for clearance for quite some time. Johnson noted that the conversation around Wembanyama’s return has been going on for two weeks.

The Spurs beat the Los Angeles Lakers in Wednesday’s NBA Cup quarterfinal to advance to Las Vegas.

Wembanyama suffered the injury during the Spurs’ game against the Golden State Warriors. San Antonio went 9-3 without their 21-year-old face of the franchise, who averaged 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 3.6 blocks in 12 games this season.

Assuming he returns, the Spurs will be fully healthy for the first time this season. It comes just in time for a matchup against the defending champion Thunder, who, at 24-1, have tied the best 25-game start in NBA history.

During the Spurs’ shootaround Wednesday morning before the NBA Cup quarterfinal, Wembanyama tested his calf by jumping on force plates, which measure impact data from a player’s leaping and landing to help determine if they are moving with sufficient impact and any imbalances in the lower body. He and the surrounding staff seemed sufficiently satisfied with the results, a precursor to the Spurs’ medical staff giving him the go-ahead to play.

While Wembanyama has been getting in a warm-up before games this week, it has been a more abridged and lower-intensity routine than usual. The Spurs were adamant that they won’t rush him back, even for a game they have clearly valued.

For the Spurs to get past the Thunder, they will need Wembanyama to blend with the uptempo offense that has thrived without him. The Spurs maintained they wanted to play in transition as much as possible entering the season, but the offense got bogged down at times trying to learn how to play through Wembanyama. Once De’Aaron Fox returned from a hamstring strain and got control of the offense, everything started to fall into place, even without Wembanyama.

“I’ve been really proud,” he said. “Of course, it’s been hard to watch from my couch, but almost every night, they have proven (to) me that I have nothing to worry about.”

He was most proud that the team is playing the brand of basketball they have been aiming for since the start of training camp. Fox’s return has catalyzed their offensive evolution, getting more players involved and into their comfort zones.

It’s why Wembanyama said they are getting closer to “ideal basketball.”

“Everybody has something to eat,” he said. “Everybody can step up at any time. Everybody can take up responsibilities. Everybody trusts their next teammate. It’s just beautiful to see.”

The team will get better with its best player back, but the challenge is to maintain that same energy. Can everyone keep eating when Wembanyama needs so many calories?

The only fully healthy defensive linemen on the Steelers roster are Logan Lee, Esezi Otomewo and Brodric Martin-Rhodes.

Yahya Black did not practice Friday, per the injury report, and fellow rookie defensive tackle Derrick Harmon continues to sit out.

That adds to three veteran defensive linemen on injured reserve for the Steelers, who have allowed 466 rushing yards over their past two games.

Monday’s opponent, the Miami Dolphins, have amassed 303 rushing yards over their past two and carry a four-game winning streak into the primetime meeting.

Harmon has missed the past two games because of a knee injury, and Black has a shoulder ailment. Additionally, the Steelers’ most accomplished defensive linemen — Cameron Heyward and Keeanu Benton — are listed on the injury report. Benton, in fact, was downgraded to limited participation Friday as he deals with his ankle injury.

Heyward missed practice Friday, listed with a knee injury. But it is not atypical for the 36-year-old to sit out a practice each week, and he is expected to play against the Dolphins.

The only fully healthy defensive linemen on the Steelers roster are Logan Lee, Esezi Otomewo and Brodric Martin-Rhodes. Those three have been in uniform for only a combined 13 games this season. Each has been a regular healthy scratch.

Kyler Baugh and Anthony Goodlow are defensive linemen on the practice squad. Between them is a total of 36 NFL regular-season snaps of experience, all by Goodlow earlier this season with the Arizona Cardinals before his release.

Dugger, others on track

Starting safety Kyle Dugger practiced fully for the second consecutive day, meaning there is a good chance he will return from a one-game absence because of a hand injury.

Other starters who practiced fully Friday despite nursing injuries were quarterback Aaron Rodgers (wrist), receiver DK Metcalf (abdomen) and inside linebacker Patrick Queen (hip).

Austin added, Pierre still out

Receiver Calvin Austin III was an addition to the injury report, getting a “limited participation” designation for Friday’s practice.

Joining T.J. Watt, Harmon, Black and Heyward as those who missed practice were starting cornerback James Pierre (calf) and fill-in starting left tackle Andrus Peat (concussion). If Pierre cannot play, Asante Samuel Jr. likely will get his first start with the Steelers. If Peat cannot play, Dylan Cook would get his first NFL start just seven days after his pro debut.

Status quo in protocol

Two other Steelers who joined Peat in NFL concussion protocol during last week’s win at the Baltimore Ravens remain limited in practice: inside linebacker Malik Harrison and tight end Darnell Washington.

Receiver and special teams ace Ben Skowronek was upgraded to a partial participant with his hand ailment suffered in Baltimore. Skowronek is expected to play against Miami.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/12/9124897_web1_ptr-Steelers38-091525.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 12:01:21.083078

,,2025-12-13 06:40:18+00:00,www.reddit.com,How did TJ Watt get a Lung Puncture? (Perspective from a Physical Therapist Certified and ...,Not Available,,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1pl8vdm/how_did_tj_watt_get_a_lung_puncture_perspective/,"What is dry needling?
In rehabilitation settings, dry needling is used as one tool among many.
Safety From a safety standpoint, dry needling has an extremely low rate of serious complications when performed by trained providers.
One study reviewing over 7,600 dry needling treatments performed by physical therapists reported zero major adverse effects.
This background makes physical therapists particularly well qualified to use techniques like dry needling safely and appropriately within a rehabilitation plan.","After hearing the news on TJ Watt, I wanted to share some info for those that are curious about what it entails. I’m a physical therapist certified in my state for dry needling, and I use it regularly in clinical practice.

What is dry needling? Dry needling is a treatment technique that uses a very thin, solid filament needle to target muscle, tendon, or connective tissue in order to reduce pain, normalize muscle activity, and improve movement. It’s called “dry” needling because there is no medication or liquid inside the needle. Unlike an injection, nothing is being delivered into the body. The needle itself is solid, not hollow, which allows it to be extremely small in diameter.

Because of this, dry needling does not cause the same tissue disruption, pain, or systemic effects that people associate with shots or injections. Most patients describe the sensation as pressure, a brief muscle twitch, or temporary soreness rather than sharp pain. The goal is to stimulate a local neuromuscular response, not to inject anything into the tissue.

In rehabilitation settings, dry needling is used as one tool among many. It is commonly paired with therapeutic exercise, manual therapy, mobility work, and movement retraining. In my own clinical experience, I’ve seen particularly strong results in conditions such as cervicogenic headaches, chronic low back pain, persistent muscle spasm, tendon-related injuries, and plantar fasciitis. In many cases, these were patients who had already tried multiple other approaches without meaningful improvement, and dry needling helped unlock progress when combined with other therapy methods.

Safety From a safety standpoint, dry needling has an extremely low rate of serious complications when performed by trained providers. Large studies show that major adverse events are essentially nonexistent in physical therapy practice. One study reviewing over 7,600 dry needling treatments performed by physical therapists reported zero major adverse effects. Minor side effects are more common and typically include temporary soreness, bruising, or localized discomfort. This is often related to the technique used. Physical therapists frequently use methods such as pistoning or fanning within the muscle to achieve a therapeutic response. The resulting soreness is similar to what someone might feel after an intense workout rather than a sign of tissue damage.

Concerns about lung injury are understandable but need context. Pneumothorax is a known but extremely rare complication. Many physical therapists are trained to avoid needling over lung fields altogether. In my own practice, I do not needle directly over thoracic regions where lung tissue could be at risk. When rib or intercostal pain is treated, there are ways to minimize risk, including shallow angles, anatomical positioning, or ultrasound guidance. Even when this complication occurs, it typically leads to observation or short-term hospitalization and is not life-threatening.

Training Physical therapists are extensively trained in musculoskeletal and human anatomy. The majority of PT education is directly connected to understanding muscles, joints, nerves, blood vessels, and how these structures interact during movement. This background makes physical therapists particularly well qualified to use techniques like dry needling safely and appropriately within a rehabilitation plan. I haven't yet seen what professional was practicing whether it was a PT or team physician but either way, both would be more than qualified.

For those interested in the research of major adverse effects:",,N,,2025-12-13 03:58:29.717522

The Seahawks will be without tight end Elijah Arroyo, who injured his knee last weekend, but are otherwise healthy heading into Sunday's game.

The Seahawks do have some roster decisions to make this weekend with several players back to practice who have not yet been activated to the roster. Center Jalen Sundell and tight end Eric Saubert, who have been on injured reserve, both returned to practice this week, while rookie defensive end Rylie Mills, who has been on the physically unable to perform list since the start of training camp, just wrapped up his third week of practice. All three players are listed as questionable for Sunday's game, but Macdonald wasn't saying which of those players will be activated.

On Sundell, who has missed four games with a knee injury, Macdonald said, ""He did good. He had a good week. He did a good job, he's looking good.""

Asked if Sundell will start at center if he is back this week, Macdonald said, ""We're going to work through the roster moves over the next couple of days. Kind of like (the Colts at quarterback), there will be a center out there on Sunday, I promise.""

Macdonald gave a similar answer on Saubert, who has been out five games with a calf injury, saying, ""Eric's also looking good. Doing a great job. Since he's made a turn here the last couple of weeks, he's really accelerated through, so Sauby's done a great job.""

If Saubert is activated ahead of Sunday's game, that would give the Seahawks added tight end depth with Arroyo out.

On Mills, Macdonald said, ""We practiced in pads the beginning of Wednesday, partially because he needed the experience, and he did well. He's looking good.""

Receiver Dareke Young, who returned to practice last week, practiced fully this week but has been ruled out.

""He's doing a great job,"" Macdonald said of Young. ""If and when he's activated, he'll be ready to go. He's doing a great job in practice.""

Macdonald also gave an update on rookie receiver Tory Horton, who is on injured reserve with a shin injury and is eligible to return next week.

""It's still a process right now,"" Macdonald said. ""We've got some tests going on—not as we speak, but in the last day or two—and that will be indicative of how fast we can accelerate everything.""

Shaquill Griffin & Cam Akers clear waivers, and 'hopefully they'll be back soon.'

Potentially needing roster spots to activate some combination of Sundell, Saubert and Mills, the Seahawks waived cornerback Shaquill Griffin and running back Cam Akers on Thursday. Both cleared waivers and Macdonald indicated both could be back with the team soon, presumably on the practice squad.

""It's really just roster management,"" Macdonald said of the moves. ""It's one of those things that's kind of a necessary evil that we have to do. To my knowledge they cleared waivers, so hopefully they'll be back soon.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/seahawks/dcroyrrljc0utst7xqzp,N,,2025-12-13 03:58:37.294332

TJ Watt injury update

Watt suffered a partially collapsed lung on Dec. 10 and was hospitalized Thursday to repair it. His lung partially collapsed reportedly during a dry needling treatment.

This is not expected to be a season-ending injury for the 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year. He may miss Week 15 but should be back before the end of the regular season.

With Watt likely out, Pittsburgh's defense will rely more on rookie Jack Sawyer and/or Nick Herbig on the edge opposite Alex Highsmith against Miami.

What is dry needling?

Dry needling is a treatment for muscle pain or tightness that uses thin, sharp needles to target a muscle trigger point, similar to acupuncture but with fewer needles.

These trigger points are areas of tight muscle tissue that can arise due to various issues. By targeting these trigger points, dry needling can help by increasing blood flow and reducing pain.

NFL players can often have dry needling performed at team facilities to help with muscle soreness during the season.

The Colts will face the Seattle Seahawks and the NFL's leading receiver, Jaxon Smith-Njigba.

INDIANAPOLIS — Colts All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner will miss his second consecutive game Sunday as the Colts square off with the Seattle Seahawks, Colts coach Shane Steichen said Friday, leaving the Colts without both their starting cornerbacks against the top receiver in the league.

Gardner suffered a calf injury just two plays into the Colts’ Week 13 home game with the Texans, forcing defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo to hand off lead duties of guarding Houston’s top wideout Nico Collins, who went on to gain 98 yards on five catches, to fellow All-Pro corner Charvarius Ward. Ward gave up six catches for 112 yards that game when he was the nearest defender in coverage to Texans receivers as he continued to find his footing two games back from going on IR for his second concussion of the season.

Last week against the Jaguars, with the Colts still missing Gardner, Ward gave up three catches for 64 yards on seven targets while the nearest defender in coverage. But the next day, he alerted the coaching staff to concussion symptoms that had cropped up again, and the Colts put him on IR this week, keeping the team’s offseason free agent signing out for the rest of the regular season.

The Colts, notably, didn’t put Gardner on IR after the Texans game, leaving hope he’d be back within a couple weeks with his calf injury, but Steichen said Wednesday ahead of practice that Gardner would not be back on the field that day, and he didn’t participate in practice again Thursday, leaving it unlikely he’d be expected to make his return in Seattle.

Without either Gardner or Ward for Sunday, the Colts will have to lean heavily on the cornerback-by-committee approach they used during Ward’s first stint on IR in Weeks 6 through 9 before the team traded for Gardner, including some combination of Mekhi Blackmon, Jaylon Jones, Jonathan Edwards and Cameron Mitchell alongside slot corner Kenny Moore II and starting safeties Nick Cross and Cam Bynum.

Their task? Finding a way to limit the league’s leading receiver, Seattle’s Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who until a couple weeks ago was tracking toward the NFL’s single-season receiving yards record. Through 13 games, he has 89 catches for 1,428 yards, nearly 150 yards more than second best, Rams’ Puka Nacua with 1,186 yards. The NFL’s all-time mark was set in 2012 by the Lions’ Calvin Johnson, who logged 1,964 yards in 16 games.

At his pace, Smith-Njigba is tracking toward 1,867 yards in 17 games, or 1,758 yards in a 16-game set comparable to Johnson’s record-setting year.

After going for eight catches for 167 yards in Week 12 at Tennessee, Smith-Njigba caught just two passes for 24 yards against Minnesota the following week, before getting seven catches for 92 yards at Atlanta a week ago.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/30/PIND/87541668007-113025-colts-texans-0119.jpg?crop=7004,3941,x0,y364&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-12 22:00:50.873470

Cornerback Christian Benford suffered a toe injury during practice Thursday and will not practice Friday. Obviously, that’s a titanic injury for the Bills as Benford has been one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL during the second half of this season.

“It was a normal practice play, tweaked his toe,” coach Sean McDermott said. “I don’t feel like it is (a long-term type of injury), but we’re only 24 hours out from it, or even less, so we’re still gathering information still. It is frustrating, but at the same time it’s next man up, we’ve been doing that all year. I’m confident that somebody will step up as needed.”

Benford will likely be listed as questionable for the game, meaning it’s going to be a 50-50 call depending on how he feels in the pregame. If Benford can’t play, the Bills would have to go with Tre’Davious White and Maxwell Hairston as their starters.

And because they lost Ja’Marcus Ingram to the Houston Texans thanks to the Darius Slay fiasco, the Bills are shorthanded at the position and would probably have to call up Dane Jackson from the practice squad to provide depth.

Joey Bosa, Spencer Brown injury update

There was good news in that both edge rusher Joey Bosa and offensive tackle Spencer Brown were going from limited to full participants in practice Friday and both are expected to play. Brown has missed the last two games with a shoulder injury and Bosa sat out last week with a hamstring injury.

Wide receiver Joshua Palmer and linebacker Terrel Bernard remain limited and while it’s unlikely Bernard will play, there is hope that Palmer can return, especially since he hinted at that when he spoke to reporters on Wednesday.","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/PROC/87661959007-bills-christian-beneford-running-towards-end-zone-after-interception-120725.jpg?crop=3330,1874,x0,y257&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-12 23:58:31.527713

Hurzeler revved up for the Liverpool game with a visit on Thursday to the headquarters in Woking of Formula 1 motor racing team McLaren.","Brighton & Hove Albion’s January window plans could be affected by the absence of Stefanos Tzimas for the rest of the season with a ruptured anterior cruciate knee ligament (ACL) injury.

The club normally uses the January window for signings for the future rather than immediate needs, as was the case earlier this year when Tzimas was bought from Nurnberg for around £20million and loaned straight back to the German club for the rest of the season.

The 19-year-old Greek prospect has been ruled out for the rest of the season by the injury sustained on his full Premier League debut in the recent 4-3 home defeat by Aston Villa.

Hurzeler, asked by The Athletic during his press conference for Saturday’s visit to Liverpool whether an extra striker in January is now a priority, said: “It can be, yes, but regarding the transfers I always emphasise that we will make decisions together (with owner Tony Bloom and the recruitment team). So, we are in exchange, we try to understand the situation, what do we need and then try to find the best solution.”

Evan Ferguson, who scored twice against Celtic in the Europa League on Thursday, would not be a like-for-like replacement for Tzimas and the terms for both clubs of the Irish striker’s loan to Roma for the rest of the season are unclear. “Evan is our player, so that’s why he will always be an option.

“Of course, now at the moment he’s on loan, but we follow it, we are pleased how he performed yesterday.”

Former Liverpool stalwart James Milner, Kaoru Mitoma, Yasin Ayari and Tommy Watson are all back in contention for the trip to Anfield. Milner, 39, has been sidelined by a muscle injury since a 4-2 defeat at Manchester United in October. Japan winger Mitoma has been missing with an ankle injury since a 3-1 win at Chelsea in September.

Sweden international midfielder Ayari has sat out the last two matches against Villa and Sunday’s 1-1 home draw with West Ham.

Winger Watson, 19, has yet to start in the league due to adaptation and injury niggles since a £10m move from Sunderland in the summer.

Hurzeler revved up for the Liverpool game with a visit on Thursday to the headquarters in Woking of Formula 1 motor racing team McLaren. He said: “I think that McLaren hold the record for the fastest pit stop, 1.8 seconds. I was asking them about it and I liked their response.

“They said they value the consistency in our pit stop always being about 2.3, 2.4 seconds. It’s not about big results, it’s about having consistency in performances. They are very aligned with our values here, so therefore I quite enjoyed it and we will definitely stay in touch, try to learn from each other.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/12064713/GettyImages-2248666376-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-12 22:01:08.383593

OUT

Patriots

RB Terrell Jennings (concussion)

Bills

No players listed

Jennings remained a non-participant through three consecutive injury reports before officially being ruled out. The 2024 undrafted arrival out of Florida A&M entered the NFL’s concussion protocol against the New York Giants as the calendar turned to December. The running back depth chart will now be subject to movement behind starter Rhamondre Stevenson and reigning AFC Offensive Rookie of the Month TreVeyon Henderson. Veteran D’Ernest Johnson, a three-time standard elevation from the practice squad, is on track to join the 53-man roster. That will require a corresponding move by 4 p.m. ET on Saturday.

“Yeah, D’Ernest will probably get to the game and help us,” New England’s head coach said. “We’ll have to figure some things out now, this afternoon or tomorrow, with the roster.”

QUESTIONABLE

LB Robert Spillane (foot)

Bills

WR Joshua Palmer (ankle)

LB Terrel Bernard (elbow)

CB Christian Benford (toe)

The Patriots added Spillane to the injury report as a limited participant on Thursday due to a foot injury. A questionable tag followed on Friday. The off-ball linebacker had seen his workload scale back to a season-low 38 defensive downs during his latest start. He ranks atop the unit with 97 tackles while also having a hand in one sack, one forced fumble, five passes defensed and two interceptions returned for 70 yards. Only cornerback Carlton Davis III and safety Craig Woodson have logged a higher rate of snaps for New England’s defense than his 95.36 percent.

But guard Jared Wilson, nose tackle Khyiris Tonga and special teams captain Brenden Schooler are set to go without game designations after landing among the inactives prior to the bye week.

""I'm calling out plays, I'm yelling,"" he said. ""I woke my son up a couple times. I got in trouble for that. It definitely felt weird just not to be there with the guys and go out and feel that energy, feel that motivation playing the Green Bay Packers.""

Fellow cornerback Jaylon Johnson also was not given an injury designation after practicing in full all week. The two-time Pro Bowler will play in his third straight game after missing nine contests with a groin injury. Johnson played 61.1% of the defensive snaps Nov. 28 against the Eagles and 66.0% last Sunday in Green Bay.

""He's getting closer and closer [to full strength] each and every week,"" said defensive coordinator Dennis Allen. ""When you think about a guy that really hadn't played a lot of football basically in about a year, it takes a little bit of time to get back to where you need to be. He's working extremely hard to do that.""

While Stevenson and Johnson will be on the field together for the first time since the season opener, nickel back Kyler Gordon has been ruled out of Sunday's game with a groin injury that he sustained during pre-game warm-ups in Green Bay.

In other injury news, running back Travis Homer will sit out Sunday with an ankle injury and receiver Rome Odunze is questionable with a foot injury that limited him all week in practice and forced him to miss the Packers game.

The Browns, meanwhile, will face the Bears without three and possibly four of their five starting offensive linemen.

Fred Johnson has started the last three games.","Some good news for the Eagles at their Friday practice:

Both Landon Dickerson (calf) and Fred Johnson (ankle) were full participants in Friday’s practice and are good to go against the Raiders on Sunday.

Dickerson missed practice on Thursday with an added rest designation after being listed as limited to start the week. Dickerson suffered a calf injury against the Chargers but was able to return and finish that game. Dickerson has dealt with several injuries this season and actually got a rest day off last week too.

Fred Johnson popped up on the injury report Thursday, which normally indicates the injury happened during practice. Johnson didn't appear to have any sort of wrap or brace on his ankle. It’s a good sign to see him on the field because it doesn’t look like the Eagles will have Lane Johnson on Sunday. Their top backup with Fred Johnson on the field is Matt Pryor.

Lane Johnson (foot) and Jalen Carter (shoulders) missed the entire week of practice and were the only two players ruled out for this game.

This will be the fourth missed game for Johnson, who suffered a Lisfranc sprain against the Lions on Nov. 16. The Eagles clearly thought there was a chance Johnson could return for this game because they didn’t put him on Injured Reserve. Fred Johnson has started the last three games. This is a big game for the right tackle because Raiders star pass rusher Maxx Crosby lines up on that side of the line around 87% of the time.

“He is a phenomenal football player,” head coach Nick Sirianni said of Crosby. “We’ve thought about him quite a bit this week. And that’s our job as players and coaches, to make sure that guys like that we think about and have a plan for.”

Without Carter last week, the Eagles’ defensive line stepped up and got constant pressure on Justin Herbert and sacked him six times. The Raiders have given up more sacks than any team in the NFL so this could be another big game up front.

Zack Baun (hand) has been a full participant this week and was back on the field Friday.

Long snapper Charley Hughlett has been listed as a full participant all week too. Hughlett will have to be activated off IR by 4 p.m. on Saturday. He is taking back his long snapper job after being out since Week 4 with a core muscle injury that required surgery.

Rookie offensive tackle Cameron Williams (shoulder) is listed as questionable. He would have to be activated from IR to the 53-man roster but that is unlikely to happen.",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/11/Johnson-F-USATSI-27572716.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-12 20:01:08.582687

While the Bengals were just fine without Higgins in the surprising triumph over the Ravens on Thanksgiving night, they can't guarantee the same will be true in Week 15.

In the three games Higgins has played with Burrow this season, he's led the Bengals in receiving twice.

Njoku was injured while catching a touchdown pass last week but has fallen behind Harold Fannin Jr. in snaps. Sampson's absence will mean a larger role for Jerome Ford. Teller's absence and Bitonio's potential absence could hurt the Browns up front against a poor Bears defense. Ward is a key piece in the secondary and will be missed. Tillman hasn't been as large a part of the offense recently as he was early in the season but is still a valuable part of the receiver rotation.

Gordon has played in only three games this year and missed last week against Green Bay. Odunze was limited in practice throughout the week after also missing last week's game against the Packers.

Bateman was a late-week addition and then downgraded to DNP on Friday, which is usually not a good sign. Washington practiced fully all week could be be gearing up to return from his extended stay on injured reserve.

Higgins will miss his second game in the last three weeks due to a concussion. Trey Hendrickson was placed on IR and is out for the year, so missing Stewart as well would be a blow to Cincinnati up front.

Harrison is out for the second week in a row and fourth time in the last five games. The Cards are beset by injuries in the secondary and potentially along the defensive line. If Demercado misses again, they'll also remain shorthanded in the backfield after they did not activate Trey Benson from injured reserve earlier this week.

If Chubb can't go, Woody Marks will again carry the load for the Texans. Bryant and Watson fully practiced on Friday while Speed was limited.

Brady Cook will start for New York with both Fields and Tyrod Taylor out. The tight end room could be depleted if Smartt joins Taylor on the sideline.

Davis is a valuable returner for the Chargers. Molden's potential absence could hurt on the back end while Pipkins' could force the Chargers deeper into their tackle depth. Johnston did not practice on Friday after being a full participant all week prior to that.

The Chiefs have had issues getting open in recent weeks, and the absence of Brown won't help their offense get back on track. Kansas City is again incredibly banged up along the offensive line. And McDuffie's potential absence would be huge if he can't go. He was limited after suffering a knee injury during last week's game.

Benford was downgraded from limited on Thursday to DNP on Friday, which is usually not a good sign for player availability. Both Bernard and Palmer were limited throughout the week.

Jennings' absence will leave the backfield work to TreVeyon Henderson and Rhamondre Stevenson. If Spillane can't go, that could hurt against a Bills offense that loves to run the ball and use multi-tight end sets to hit defenses with play-action passes.

Daniels is not yet cleared for contact after aggravating his elbow injury last week. The Commies could be even more shorthanded if Rodriguez and/or Samuel can't play. Rodriguez was limited throughout the week and Samuel did not practice on Friday.

The Giants have all kinds of issues up front on defense, which could be exacerbated if Lawrence, in particular, can't play. Lawrence was a late-week addition to the report, which is usually not a good sign. They could also be shorthanded in the special teams department without their punter and possible their primary return specialist.

Kenny Pickett will start in place of Geno Smith. He'll have a depleted offensive line in front of him and could potentially be without the team's best blocking tight end as well.

Neither Carter nor Johnson practiced at all this week. They are massive losses on their respective sides of the ball.

Jacobs got in a limited practice on Friday after not practicing earlier in the week. If he's out, Emanuel Wilson and Chris Brooks will carry the load. Van Ness was limited throughout the week.

Denver could be shorthanded up front against the ferocious Green Bay pass rush. McGlinchey was a late-week add and didn't practice on Friday. Bryant's absence will thrust Troy Franklin and potential Lil'Jordan Humphrey into larger roles as outside receivers.

Detroit has a number of injuries in the secondary, specifically at safety, which could be a big liability against the Rams. The injuries along the offensive line could be damaging as well, against L.A.'s strong defensive front.

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

Ruled OUT

S Kerby Joseph (knee)

S Brian Branch (Achilles)

Joseph has apparently suffered a setback with his knee, according to coach Dan Campbell, and is now a candidate for IR. Landing in IR at this time of year would effectively end a season of frustration, where he’s continuously fought to get his knee rehabilitated.

“Kerby had a setback, so obviously, not as – don’t feel as good about that,” Campbell said on Friday

Branch being ruled out is a formality, as he has already had successful Achilles surgery and is expected to be placed on IR on Saturday.

Questionable

RB Sione Vaki (thumb)

WR Kalif Raymond (ankle)

TE Shane Zylstra (knee, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 9

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

LG Kayode Awosika (foot)

LG Christian Mahogany (fibula, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 18

S Thomas Harper (concussion)

Vaki has been able to play through his thumb injury for a few weeks now and is expected to play this weekend, despite the questionable designation.

Raymond has been trending toward returning this week, and he should have a chance to be active on Sunday. If able to play, he should reassume his punt returner role and will contribute as a WR3 or WR4 option on offense.

Zylstra remains on injured reserve for the moment, but a questionable designation suggests there’s a chance he is removed from IR—likely this Saturday before the team travels to LA—and re-added to the 53-man roster. He’ll have a chance to step into a TE1 or TE2 upon his return to action.

Decker missed all three practices this week, which is mildly concerning, but this is something the veteran offensive lineman has done previously this year, so there’s still a realistic chance he can suit up on Sunday. It’s notable that “rest” was added to his injury report on Friday. If he’s not able to play, Dan Skipper would most likely step into the starting left tackle role, and his sixth OL role would be passed along to another reserve offensive lineman.

Mahogany has participated in three practices since his injury evaluation clock has started, and while it seems unlikely he’ll be activated from IR this week, the Lions have left the door open. Mahogany has said he doesn’t anticipate being in this recovery window for long, but it’ll likely be at least another week before he gets another shot to return to the active roster.

Awosika missed last week’s game but has been able to practice all week and will have a chance to start at left guard in this game. If the Lions feel like he’s not quite ready to return to that role, Detroit would then turn to Trystan Colon. Regardless of which player starts, there’s a good chance rookie Miles Frazier will cut into some of their reps as the Lions seem determined to get him more experience.

Harper has practiced all week, but Campbell wouldn’t go as far as to say that he’s cleared the NFL’s concussion protocols just yet.

“Harper will be out there at practice today, so feel pretty good about him, but we’ll see,” Campbell explained on Friday. “There again, I can’t give you a definitive right now, but that’s kind of where we’re at. So, we’ll be good.

If Harper is unable to clear on time—and with Joseph and Branch unavailable—the Lions will likely turn to Avonte Maddox and either Daniel Thomas or practice squad safety Erick Hallett.

“Look, Hallett’s been taking reps, (Thomas’) DT’s been taking reps, Maddox has been taking reps,” Campbell said Friday. “We’ve got plenty of guys. They’re getting valuable reps, so we’re good.”

The Lions also claimed Jalen Mills off waivers and signed Damontae Kazee to their practice squad this week, but the chances are neither will be up to speed enough to challenge for a heavy contributing role this weekend.

Not listed with an injury designation

LB Alex Anzalone (illness)

Anzalone missed practice on Wednesday with an illness, but he was able to return to practice on Thursday and looks ready to play against the Rams on Sunday.

He won't carry an injury designation into Sunday's game, so hopefully that signals the bye week did Landry some good.","New England is preparing for a huge divisional showdown with the Buffalo Bills at Gillette Stadium on Sunday, where a win would clinch the AFC East for the Patriots.

After having a late bye in Week 14, the good news is that the Patriots roster is getting healthier for the stretch run and arguably the biggest home game in nearly four years. On Friday, the Patriots listed only two players with game statuses: RB Terrell Jennings (concussion) was ruled out, and LB Robert Spillane (foot) is officially questionable. Buffalo listed CB Christian Benford (toe), LB Terrell Bernard (elbow), and WR Joshua Palmer (ankle) as questionable. DE Joey Bosa (hamstring/wrist) and RT Spencer Brown (shoulder) will play for the Bills on Sunday.

Starting on offense, the bye week did some good for starting LG Jared Wilson, who missed a Week 13 win over the Giants due to an ankle injury. Wilson injured his ankle early in the first quarter of the Patriots victory in Cincinnati in Week 12, playing just three snaps vs. the Bengals, and then sat out the game against New York heading into the bye. The third-round rookie has started 11 games at left guard in his first season, flashing his high-end athleticism on the move in the run game, and was starting to find a groove in pass protection. In his last two full games prior to the injury, Wilson had allowed just one total pressure vs. the Bucs and Jets.

Based on media access at Patriots practice, it seems as though Wilson will be reinserted into the starting lineup on Sunday after participating fully in all three sessions this week. With the rookie guard expected back in the starting lineup, the Patriots could start their fourth different offensive line combination through 14 games: LT Vederian Lowe, LG Jared Wilson, C Garrett Bradbury, RG Mike Onwenu, and RT Morgan Moses. Although injuries to their rookie starters on the left side have led to some shuffling, New England started 11 different line combinations during the 2024 season, so they've still had great continuity on the O-Line, comparatively speaking.

The other injury-related topic worth discussing offensively is who will serve as the Patriots third running back this week. With Jennings (concussion) ruled out, New England only has two healthy backs on the active roster, Rhamondre Stevenson and TreVeyon Henderson. On the practice squad, RB D'Ernest Johnson has already hit the maximum of three standard elevations, but head coach Mike Vrabel said Johnson will be moved to the active roster. The Patriots will need to make room on the 53-man roster for Johnson, with that move likely coming on Saturday.

Moving over to the other side of the ball, the positive injury update for the Patriots defense is that NT Khyiris Tonga is trending toward a return. Tonga also sat out the Giants game after suffering a chest injury Week 12 in Cincinnati. This week, the big nose tackle was a full participant in practice, while telling reporters that he ""feels good"" coming off some extra rest. Tonga is a huge part of New England's run defense and plays a small role on offense as a lead-blocker in short-yardage situations, which could help the Patriots slumping red zone offense.​

New England's run defense has been very stingy with Tonga, allowing -0.10 expected points added with its 335-pound nose tackle on the field. When he hasn't been available, the Patriots run defense is allowing an even 0.0 EPA per rush – a +0.10 EPA difference in favor of the offense, which is substantial. The Bills enter the week ranked seventh in rush EPA, led by star RB James Cook, who in many ways has become the engine of Buffalo's offense. Although most start with slowing down MVP quarterback Josh Allen, limiting Cook is arguably just as important.

Before the bye week, the Patriots run defense was slumping, ranking last in rushing success rate allowed in their previous four games (53.3%). Tonga's return and the rest of New England's defensive front getting some much-needed rest during the bye week will hopefully see the run defense return to form. In the first nine weeks, the Patriots ranked fifth in rushing success rate allowed (36.2%), so it's possible that the slump was just injury and lack-of-rest-related.

As for Spillane, the Patriots captain is dealing with a foot injury that led to him being a limited participant in the last two practices. Spillane only played 69.1% of the defensive snaps, a smaller workload than usual, in New England's last game before its bye week vs. the Giants. If he's limited again this week, the Pats leaned more on Jack Gibbens alongside Christian Elliss at linebacker.

Lastly, captain Harold Landry III continues to manage a lingering knee injury stemming from an injury scare during New England's Week 6 win against the Saints. Landry returned to Friday's practice after being limited on Wednesday and a non-participant on Thursday. He won't carry an injury designation into Sunday's game, so hopefully that signals the bye week did Landry some good. The Patriots have relied on undrafted rookie Elijah Ponder and vet Anfernee Jennings as depth on the edge.

By starting the season 11-2, the Patriots have played their way into an incredible opportunity to clinch the AFC East with a win over the Bills on Sunday. Buffalo has won the division for five consecutive seasons, dating back to 2020, but New England has a very simple playoff clinching scenario this week: win, and you're division champs. To claim the AFC East title on their own terms would be a massive accomplishment for head coach Mike Vrabel and company.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/patriots/ymquxjobw6gonahltpkn,N,,2025-12-12 17:05:07.713603

According to J.J., there is no timeline for recovery at the moment, but T.J. was set to be released from the hospital on Friday.

Watt has been ruled out for Monday night's game against the Miami Dolphins.

Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said he spoke with Watt on Wednesday evening, and said the pass rusher was ""comfortable."" Tomlin added that Watt was not dealing with an injury coming out of Week 14's game and that was he was unaware when or how Watt's symptoms started.

Watt, 31, has appeared in all 13 of the Steelers' games this season. He's registered 53 tackles and seven sacks in those contests.

While Watt has battled injuries in the past, he's been relatively healthy the past couple seasons. Prior to 2025, Watt played in 17 games in back-to-back years. He made the Pro Bowl in both seasons, earning a first team All-Pro nod in 2023 after leading the league with 19 sacks.

In July, the Steelers gave Watt a three-year, $123 million extension. The contract made Watt the highest paid non-quarterback in NFL history. That record has since been passed by Detroit Lions pass rusher Aidan Hutchinson.

Watt's absence at team facilities comes at a difficult time. At 7-6, the Steelers lead the AFC North, but their grasp on that spot is tenuous at best. The 6-7 Baltimore Ravens sit just behind Pittsburgh in the division. If Watt misses time, the Steelers would need to find a way to hold onto their lead in the AFC North without arguably their best player.

“We didn’t come out and dictate how to play the game,” Leafs coach Craig Berube said of his team’s poor third period, which he pointed to as the reason for the loss. “We turned pucks over, we were passive, we didn’t finish them off.”

After taking a 2-1 lead on the strength of goals from Dakota Joshua and Auston Matthews and the continued strong play of Dennis Hildeby, losing Oliver Ekman-Larsson to injury seemed to derail the Leafs. They looked sloppy in multiple shifts later in the third period, and some of their best players didn’t look at their best in overtime. The Sharks ultimately capitalized, coming back to take a 3-2 win in the extra frame.

“I still think we’re not where we need to be. We can be better. The third period showed that,” Berube said.

The Leafs managed a point, sure, but should they end up missing the playoffs by a thin margin, this loss feels like one they will look back on and regret.

Here’s more of what we saw:

Ekman-Larsson’s injury could be potentially catastrophic

Ekman-Larsson seemed to know right away that he was in serious trouble.

After colliding with Sharks forward Adam Gaudette in the third period, Ekman-Larsson’s left leg appeared to twist under the weight of a falling Gaudette. It looked like a freak play that happens often in NHL games, but the outcome here was much different and potentially, for the Leafs, much worse.

Ekman-Larsson could not get up and off the ice on his own. He required the help of teammates Calle Järnkrok and Morgan Rielly. Ekman-Larsson could not put any weight on his left leg. Once the Leafs defenceman left the ice, he continued to struggle to walk, using his stick to help himself to the dressing room.

“He’s got to be re-evaluated tomorrow,” Berube said of Ekman-Larsson. “I don’t know exactly the length of it.“

However, it was the look of resignation on Ekman-Larsson’s face that told the whole story: This did not look like the kind of injury that any player could recover from quickly enough.

“He’ll be missed,” Berube said, which didn’t sound promising. “Hopefully it’s not too bad.”

First, on Ekman-Larsson: If he’s out long-term, what a genuine shame. He’s in the middle of a great season and has been the Leafs’ best defenceman most nights. He has even been garnering some low-key attention for Sweden’s Olympic team, though he told me on Wednesday he wasn’t thinking about that whatsoever.

Next, on the Leafs defence: Man oh man, if you think the Leafs might be cursed, you are probably pointing to the injuries on their blue line right now. The timeline for both Chris Tanev and Brandon Carlo to return from their respective injuries is unclear.

Berube did say, after being asked by a reporter, whether Carlo had recently undergone surgery. Berube confirmed he did and that Carlo is expected to miss “about” a month because of it. What exactly Carlo had surgery on remains unclear.

Dakota Mermis is also out with a knee injury. Henry Thrun was called up from the Marlies to play his first game for the Leafs this season, and looked like he could have a job in the NHL.

Losing Ekman-Larsson could be potentially catastrophic for the blue line. The Leafs don’t have another puck-mover with his power-play capabilities and experience.

Marshall Rifai is practicing in a red no-contact jersey after a wrist injury requiring surgery in training camp. He could potentially be an option to hop on the back end, though when exactly that could happen is unclear. William Villeneuve is having another strong season for the Marlies and deserves his first NHL call-up, but he’s currently unavailable due to illness. The Marlies hope to know more about his return next week.

Look to the Leafs to likely call up Matt Benning, a right-shot defenceman who was an NHL regular as recently as 2022-23.

If Ekman-Larsson’s injury is serious, the Leafs would be down to three of their preferred top six defencemen for the foreseeable future. For a team that struggled to defend well early this season, they now have an even taller mountain to climb.

The power play is alive!

Cue my Colin Clive impersonation as Dr. Frankenstein: “The power play! It’s alive!”

Through two first-period power plays, the woeful Maple Leafs power play awoke with some of the most dynamic and purposeful puck movement we’ve seen this season.

Quick, quick, quick — that’s how the Leafs looked on the power play.

Is it just that simple? Throw the puck around with purpose and some aggression and good things will happen? Surely not, but something sparked the Leafs; they did not look like a team with a league-worst power play. Matthews scored the Leafs’ first power-play goal in five games thanks to a gnarly cross-ice pass from William Nylander.

“They moved it and shot it, moved it and shot it,” Berube said. “Things opened up.”

At the very least, the energy from all three of the Leafs’ power plays offered something to build off of. The Leafs didn’t score on their first power play, but they did land four shots, most of which were dangerous.

It needs to be said, though: The Sharks’ defensive positioning ahead of Matthews’ goal was ridiculously poor. The four players who left Matthews with that much time and space with their heads turned elsewhere are going to have that play clipped and shown multiple times in video sessions, and it won’t be pretty.

Joshua is coming into his own

After a rough start to the season, in which Joshua himself called out his own game, the offseason acquisition is starting to come into his own. His efforts against the Sharks stood out: Joshua was relentless in pursuing pucks, hounded the opposition with his size and got in the right spots to create offensive chances.

Was his game-opening goal a Mona Lisa? Hardly: Joshua got in front of Sharks defenceman Timothy Liljegren (and likely triggered some Liljegren haters in the process) and got a stick on a Jake McCabe shot. The puck bounced off Joshua’s stick and then off Liljegren and into the Sharks’ net.

Berube demands effort down low, in the ugly areas of the ice. There was more fearlessness from Joshua in his 15:03 TOI on Thursday than he’d shown in October and November. He has now scored three goals in his last six games.

Yes, some of his pop tonight was a byproduct of playing with Nylander — one of the best offensive players in the league — but Joshua looks to be finding his groove. From the outside, he appears to be playing with a level of comfort and confidence he struggled to attain in his transition to Toronto. It was on display against San Jose.

His third-period interference penalty wasn’t a great one to take. Still, an effective and forceful Joshua could continue to give the Leafs the bottom-six punch they need, even when Bobby McMann (serving a one-game suspension) returns to that line on Saturday.

Hildeby’s positioning is the best part of his game

The Leafs’ new No. 1 goalie put forth another stellar performance, including stopping a Ty Dellandrea penalty shot in the first period. It was how Hildeby stopped the shot, and 29 of the 32 he faced, that stood out: He rarely looked out of position. He’s using his 6-foot-7 frame to his advantage in a way he didn’t last season. He barely had to move to get a glove on Dellandrea’s shot; he read the shot the whole way. And when he did have to move side to side, there was an economy within Hildeby’s movements.

Hildeby can’t really be faulted for any of the Leafs’ three goals against. While Joseph Woll is trending toward being available this weekend after a recent injury, it feels like Berube and company should ride Hildeby’s hot hand against the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday.

Nylander and Nick Robertson respond to changes

McMann’s suspension led to movement in the Leafs forward group: Nylander was shuffled down to the third line because of a recent (minor) dip in his play, and Nick Robertson, after a recent healthy scratch, was placed back in the lineup.

Both players responded as Berube hoped they would.

Robertson was all over the ice, hounding pucks and setting up teammates with creative puck movement. Robertson was tied for second among all Leafs with three shots on goal, and at five-on-five, led all Leafs with three scoring chances, per Natural Stat Trick.

And Nylander?

“The best game I’ve seen him play in a while,” Berube said. “He was engaged. When I see him skating and handling the puck and keeping the puck and doing the things he did tonight with the puck, I know he was ready to go.”

Nylander logged two assists in 21:57 of ice time, his highest TOI in over a month. His stint on the third line is undoubtedly over, but it will be remembered fondly.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/11234855/GettyImages-2251272993-scaled-e1765514986369.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-12 16:02:42.454203

The question now becomes whether Jones has taken his last snap for the franchise — unless you think 44-year-old Philip Rivers is their quarterback of the future.

After a sad end to his Giants stint and a brief run as a Vikings practice squad player, Jones signed a one-year, $14 million contract with the Colts last offseason.

He won the starting job over Anthony Richardson and impressed — 3,109 passing yards and 19 touchdowns — under QB-friendly head coach Shane Steichen.

Jones, 28, had been setting himself up for a massive free agency payday with the Colts or another team.

However, his injury — which approximately has a nine-month recovery timeline — complicates things as it’s unclear if he will be ready for the start of next season.

Jones also has the baggage of a disastrous end to his Giants tenure, which saw him demoted to fourth-string before eventually being released at his own request last season.

The Colts pulled Rivers out of retirement as a Band-Aid as they try to resuscitate their once hopeful season.

Richardson is sidelined with a fractured orbital bone suffered in a freak pregame incident, but doubts about his future with the franchise goes beyond the injury.

The No. 4 pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, has been plagued by spotty play and losing out on the job to Jones was a glaring indictment on how he is viewed.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/daniel-jones-17-indianapolis-colts-116940447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-12-12 15:01:52.640282

Lamb returned to practice as a full participant on Thursday as his recovery has gone well enough for him to return for Sunday Night Football.

Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker T.J. Watt had successful surgery to ""stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung,"" according to his brother J.J.

Watt was in a dry needling treatment session at the team's practice facility on Wednesday when he started to feel discomfort. There is no timeline for a recovery, but he will be released from the hospital on Friday, according to J.J. Watt.

Other notable Week 15 injuries:

Cincinnati Bengals receiver Tee Higgins has been ruled out for Sunday's matchup with the Baltimore Ravens due to a concussion. Higgins missed Week 13 with a concussion and found himself back in protocol this week after getting injured last week against the Buffalo Bills. Higgins was evaluated in-game and cleared to return, but Bengals head coach Zac Taylor said Monday that the receiver was back in protocol. He was limited during Thursday's practice and ultimately ruled out Friday afternoon.

The Washington Commanders have already ruled quarterback Jayden Daniels out for Week 15 due to aggravating an elbow injury in Week 14's loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Daniels had just returned from a three-game absence after dislocating that elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. Marcus Mariota will start his seventh game this season when the Commanders face the New York Giants on Sunday.

Trey Benson will not return this season after the Arizona Cardinals chose not to activate him from injured reserve during his 21-day practice window. The running back has been out since Week 4 with a knee injury. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Benson had not progressed enough to warrant a return this season.

Injuries to his right shoulder and back will likely sideline Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Geno Smith for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Kenny Pickett has been taking first-team reps this week as head coach Pete Carroll called Smith ""day-to-day.""

Injuries to his right shoulder and back will likely sideline Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Geno Smith for Sunday's game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Kenny Pickett has been taking first-team reps this week as head coach Pete Carroll called Smith ""day-to-day.""

Johnson didn't practice on Dec. 11, so it's more than likely that he won't play against the Raiders on Dec. 14 with just one more day in the practice week.

But Johnson wasn't the only offensive lineman sitting out. Left guard Landon Dickerson also missed practice because of a calf injury/rest designation, and Lane Johnson's replacement, Fred Johnson, was listed as limited with an ankle injury.

Defensive tackle Jalen Carter also sat out practice. He's expected to miss his second straight game after having a non-surgical procedure on both of his shoulders.

Dickerson left the game in the first half against the Chargers on Dec. 8 with a calf injury, but returned in the fourth quarter.

Dickerson was listed as ""limited"" on Dec. 10, but that was an estimation based on a walkthrough practice. The Eagles had a full practice on Dec. 11. Fred Johnson was not listed on the injury report on Dec. 10, meaning that he likely suffered his injury during practice.

If both Lane and Fred Johnson can't play against the Raiders, Matt Pryor would be the likely replacement.

Fred Johnson has replaced Lane Johnson for the past three games, all losses. Brett Toth went in for Dickerson against the Chargers.

It's likely that the Eagles didn't put Lane Johnson on IR, requiring him to miss four games, when he first suffered the injury because it was determined that surgery wasn't required. That would have ended his season.

Instead, the Eagles took a chance that Lane Johnson could return before the four games were up. And really, Johnson, a perennial Pro Bowl player, were never going to fill his roster spot with a suitable replacement.

,,2025-12-12 12:38:31+00:00,The Athletic,How Arsenal reintegrate players returning from injury: Bespoke programmes – and patience,Art de Roché,,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6881440/2025/12/12/arsenal-reintegrating-players-from-injury/,"At the start of December, Mikel Arteta said injuries had been “a theme of this season” for his Arsenal side.
Which is why Arteta has reintegrated his returning casualties differently over the course of the season.

The return of multiple players in the same position has allowed Arteta to patiently reintroduce Martinelli and Madueke.
But obviously the fact that you are missing players, (means) you are loading other players more (as) a consequence.","At the start of December, Mikel Arteta said injuries had been “a theme of this season” for his Arsenal side.

After 15 league games, Arsenal have suffered that very same number of injuries, but as they are currently top of both the Premier League and Champions League tables, their lengthy list of absentees has largely been a subplot to the campaign so far.

November was a particularly bleak one in injury terms with up to seven players out at one point, and six of those being midfielders and attackers: Viktor Gyokeres, Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Martinelli, Noni Madueke and Martin Odegaard. In recent weeks, all bar Havertz have returned, with each comeback being managed differently.

It might seem players hit the ground running after a period out of action, like Jesus seemingly did in a 30-minute appearance off the bench in the 3-0 Champions League win away to Club Brugge of Belgium on Wednesday, but his return from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injury is more nuanced than the Brazilian instantly finding form after an 11-month absence.

Players need time. These are human beings, not plug-in-and-play robots. Which is why Arteta has reintegrated his returning casualties differently over the course of the season.

For Jesus, there were seven months between the match in which he was injured and when he began doing on-pitch work again in August. At that point, some may have assumed his comeback was imminent, but another three months would pass before he played competitively again. He needed weeks of full training with the first team and two appearances in internal friendlies before Arteta deemed him ready, the manager pulling him back like a slingshot before finally flinging him onto the pitch in Bruges.

Asked if he could be as good post-ACL as he was before, or even better, Jesus’ answer after that midweek victory was unequivocal: “One hundred per cent.”

“It doesn’t matter about the chances I had (on the night),” he told reporters. “I got in good positions, I could finish the actions and hit the target. The three chances I had, I hit the target. Obviously, I had to score, but just to come back after 11 months and move the way I moved, I’m so pleased.”

After suffering a hamstring injury in the second game of the season, Bukayo Saka was out for almost a month before coming off the substitutes’ bench in the draw against Manchester City on September 21. Three days later, to the surprise of many, he was in the starting line-up for a Carabao Cup tie away to Port Vale of League One, English football’s third tier.

“He (Saka) needs minutes, and he’s demanding that as well,” said Arteta before that match, with the England international going on to play for an hour in a 2-0 Arsenal win. “Obviously, when he’s been out for a while, you just need to get in the rhythm. You need to get that confidence on the pitch and repeat actions and exposure.”

The need to find rhythm by repeating actions in-game would have been why Madueke, Martinelli and Gyokeres all started against Club Brugge, with their returns having varied levels of success.

Madueke’s direct running was what excited people early on in his Arsenal career following a summer move from Chelsea. Before starting on Wednesday, and scoring two of the goals, the England international winger had played 169 minutes from a possible 450 in the previous five games to build momentum and confidence. Similarly, Martinelli had featured in 144 of a possible 360 (four matches) before the trip to Belgium, but only looked comfortable taking on his man after the break.

Unsurprisingly, both finished the Club Brugge game having attempted and completed more dribbles than any other player. Martinelli completed three of his six attempted dribbles, Madueke two of his four.

The return of multiple players in the same position has allowed Arteta to patiently reintroduce Martinelli and Madueke. This could also help on Havertz too, with Arteta recently saying the German forward is now only weeks away from a comeback having been out since August with a knee injury, though he didn’t confirm whether that would happen before the end of the calendar year.

However, the manager hasn’t had the same luxury in other positions, something which has been particularly noticeable at right-back for several seasons.

“We don’t have time to train (because Arsenal play so many matches),” Arteta explained. “So training is not there. But obviously the fact that you are missing players, (means) you are loading other players more (as) a consequence. It’s a really dangerous circle.”

In Ben White’s first two seasons as a right-back for the club (2022-23 and 2023-24), serious calf and knee injuries to Takehiro Tomiyasu and Jurrien Timber respectively meant he started 71 of the 75 league games he was available for, sometimes playing through pain to do so. Come 2024-25, White required knee surgery in November. With Tomiyasu again unavailable, Timber was Arsenal’s fifth most-used outfield player last season. As the season was reaching its conclusion in May, he had an ankle operation.

If Arsenal beat Crystal Palace in a Carabao Cup quarter-final on December 23, they face the prospect of having a midweek game every week until February across the various competitions.

Before the 2-0 league win against Brentford last Wednesday, Arteta said the inability to train properly meant the focus between matches was “much more on principles and what we have to do, and then tweaking that in relation to the opponent’s strengths and weaknesses”.

Arsenal are about to have the rare luxury of a full week’s training, with seven days between the league fixtures at home to Wolves on Saturday and away to Everton on December 20 because of the postponement of that Palace tie due to the south Londoners’ ongoing UEFA Conference League commitments.

Once Christmas is out of the way, however, Arteta will need to ensure those who are returning from injuries are getting the right exposure to match action at the right time.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/11115214/GettyImages-2251248693-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-12 10:03:41.858093

Let’s take a look at the latest injury report and get you up to date with what we know. Note: Any changes from the last injury report will be bolded.

No practice

LT Taylor Decker (shoulder)

S Kerby Joseph (knee) — Downgraded from limited practice

S Brian Branch (Achilles)

Decker typically sits out at least one practice each week, as part of his injury management program. And while missing a second practice is not unusual, it’s been a while since it’s happened, and it’s worth keeping an eye on.

Joseph returned to practice last week, but only practiced one day, while sitting out the other two practices. The All-Pro safety was already on the practice field on Wednesday this week, so a rest day on Thursday could be part of the rehabilitation plan. While this absence does not necessarily indicate a setback, it’s also not encouraging for his chances of playing this weekend.

Branch’s continued appearance on the injury report is only because they have not placed him on injured reserve. This is merely a formality at this point, as he has already had successful surgery on his Achilles and is clearly done for the season.

Limited practice

RB Sione Vaki (thumb)

WR Kalif Raymond (ankle)

TE Shane Zylstra (knee, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 10

LG Christian Mahogany (fibula, still on IR) — Days remaining in injury evaluation clock: 19

LG Kayode Awosika (foot)

S Thomas Harper (concussion)

Vaki’s thumb injury continues to limit him in practices, but he’s been good to go in games. If the thumb injury is a sprain, it could linger a bit longer, but if it’s a break, he may be dealing with this for the remainder of the season.

Raymond returned to practice on Wednesday after missing the previous two games. Special teams coordinator Dave Fipp insisted that once available, Raymond will return to his punt returner role, but also acknowledged Tom Kennedy has done enough to keep the kick return role. Raymond would also likely return to a WR3/4 role on offense, likely splitting time with rookie Isaac TeSlaa.

Zylstra has stacked another practice, and with the Lions releasing two tight ends in the last two days, the writing on the wall suggests Zylstra has a good chance of being removed from injured reserve and added back to the 53-man roster as early as this weekend.

Mahogany is just two days into his injury evaluation window and appears to be progressing well. While he has suggested he wants to try to return this week, the more likely scenario is that he would make his return for the Lions’ Week 16 game against the Pittsburgh Steelers or the Week 17 game in Minnesota.

Awosika missed last week’s game due to a mid-week foot injury, but his stacking two practices is a good sign that he may be able to return to the starting left guard position. Things are still a bit up in the air—will Awosika or Mahogany be ready?—but the Lions could always turn back to veteran Trystan Colon, who has started each of the last two weeks.

Harper has now practiced for two days in a row and appears to be on the right track to be cleared from the League’s concussion protocol in time to play on Sunday. With Branch headed to injured reserve and Joseph looking like he could miss another week, the Lions would really benefit from having Harper available.

Full practice

LB Alex Anzalone (illness) — upgraded from no practice

Anzalone didn’t practice on Wednesday due to an illness, but he was back at practice on Thursday, suggesting he’s on track to play on Sunday. Anzalone is a unique cog in the Lions’ defense, and with the Rams on the docket, Detroit will surely need his coverage skills.

Let's not think about that right now. Let's focus on the present. At present, your job is to survive and advance. That might mean some creative lineup management. And to help with that ... here are some names.

It’s a tough week for streaming quarterbacks. Guys like Tyler Shough or Shedeur Sanders , who appeared in this column last week, have far tougher matchups in Week 15. Anyone hoping to slot in Riley Leonard in place of the injured Daniel Jones will need to keep an eye on this week’s injury reports. So it is with much trepidation that I present to you Mr. Jonathan James McCarthy.

Last week, he crept into the top 12 thanks to three touchdown passes. But there have been more tricks than treats in his fantasy bag this year. However, Michael F. Florio pointed out on the NFL Fantasy Football Podcast that McCarthy’s worst games have come against either elite defenses or defenses seeing him for a second time. The Dallas Cowboys are neither. While the 'Boys are improved, they’re still prone to giving up big passing days. I wouldn’t recommend starting McCarthy outside of two-QB formats, but there is QB2 upside -- especially if the Vikings are chasing points in the second half.

Did I mention it’s a rough week for streaming quarterbacks? Because yeah. Cousins’ return to starter status has been snooze-worthy at best, stomach-churning at worst. His 2.48 fantasy points in Week 14 aren’t inspiring. Nor is the prospect of Atlanta enduring another week without Drake London . Above the protestations of many Falcons fans, the team is required by NFL bylaws to suit up and play this week. And so it goes.

Also struggling is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers pass defense. The Bucs have allowed the sixth-most passing yards in the NFL. In Weeks 10-13, they gave up an average of 290 yards per game. That feels like a tall bar for Cousins to reach at this point. But he could become the 10th quarterback to reach 15 fantasy points against Tampa this season. That’s enough to make him a QB2 in most formats this week.

Mitchell left last week’s loss to Pittsburgh with a knee injury. That’s the bad news. The good news is he is listed as day-to-day and has practiced this week. The better news is that Mitchell is coming off his best game since suffering a torn ACL in 2023. The best news is that he and the Ravens are facing the Bengals this week.

Mitchell did the most with his two carries, scoring a touchdown, when these teams met on Thanksgiving night, though game script forced Baltimore to throw more than it might have liked to. While the young back isn’t playing a ton of snaps, when he is on the field, he’s usually touching the ball. He’s also regained his explosive form, averaging 6.3 yards per carry (he averaged 6.5 yards per carry in his breakout rookie performances). Cincinnati continues to be the best matchup for running backs this season. Even with limited opportunities, Mitchell could have some flex appeal in deeper leagues.

First, let me start by saying that you can drop Jacory Croskey-Merritt . He’s still rostered in more than 50 percent of NFL.com leagues. Stop that. It was fun for a couple of weeks. But it’s over. The Commanders have turned to Rodriguez to lead their backfield and while that level of responsibility is a bridge too far for most fantasy managers, giving Rodriguez a spot in your lineup might not be.

Since Week 9, C-Rod (can we call him that?) leads Washington’s backfield in snaps and rush attempts. He also has a healthy 28 percent route participation -- even if the target share is woefully low. More importantly, he’s getting half of the team’s goal-line work. This week, he takes that up against the Giants and their 31st-ranked run defense. Big Blue is giving up the second-most fantasy points per game to running backs. Rodriguez doesn’t have the highest ceiling, but the matchup is favorable enough to make him a deep league flex this week.

We may have seen the rise of TreVeyon Henderson in recent weeks, but that doesn’t mean Stevenson has gone away. In the two games since returning from a toe injury, Stevenson has commanded nearly half of the rushing attempts and 75 percent of snaps in the two-minute offense.

Those numbers could come down a tick after the Patriots’ bye, but it keeps the veteran in play against the woeful Buffalo run stoppers. The Bills have looked better the past two weeks, but their 28th-ranked run defense has led to the seventh-most favorable matchups to RBs. Add Stevenson’s role in the passing game and he has flex value.

Despite leaving New York’s last game with a hip injury, Tracy appears on track to play after Big Blue’s bye week. Since the Giants lost Cam Skattebo , Tracy has maintained a healthy snap share and nearly 50 percent of the team’s rushing attempts. He’s also managed to carve out a meager target share as well. He topped 20 touches in Weeks 11 and 12 and was on his way before the injury in Week 13.

If styles make fights, then New York’s run-heavy offense should find the underbelly of the Commanders' 29th-ranked run defense. Washington has allowed a top-24 running back in four straight games. Tracy doesn’t have the highest ceiling, but he tops as a high-end RB2 in this week’s positive matchup.

What might have been for Pearsall in 2025. He started hot, leading the Niners in receiving yards through the first four weeks. Then a PCL sprain kept him out for six games. His return has been disappointing, to say the least. In three games, Pearsall has nine targets, five catches and 20 yards. Oof.

Whatever postseason aspirations the 49ers have will need to include Pearsall in some way. His snap share and route participation have been solid. The target share has been lacking. This is a good week to change that. The Titans are in the bottom seven in passing yards allowed to wideouts. The Niners offense has been disjointed this season, but if Brock Purdy and company can find a rhythm, Pearsall is in line for a big play or two. For managers in deeper leagues, he’s an upside flex.

The Titans offense is still a work in progress. But there have been some bright spots. Among them has been Dike. The rookie has made more of a name for himself as a return specialist, but he’s also flashed at times as a receiver. Dike has four weekly finishes inside the top 24 wide receivers. In three of those four, he tallied more than 16 points.

He matches up well against the 49ers this week. Dike spends more than half of his snaps from the slot. San Francisco has been one of the friendliest defenses to players in that alignment. Expect the Titans to be in the familiar position of chasing points in the second half. There should be plenty of targets to be had. Another top-24 finish for Dike wouldn’t be surprising.

It’s a rough week on the tight end front. The best matchups belong to guys who are bona fide starters and don’t belong in this column. George Kittle against the Titans. Tyler Warren against the Seahawks. Isaiah Likely against the Bengals. Or there are guys who are too much of a stretch to consider them in any situation. Are you really trusting your playoff life to AJ Barner , Chigoziem Okonkwo or T.J. Hockenson ?

That brings us to Freiermuth. He resides in the center of the Venn diagram with categories such as good matchup, decent usage and quality talent. The Dolphins have been tight end friendly this season, giving up the third-most points to the position. With Darnell Washington in concussion protocol, there’s an opportunity for Freiermuth to absorb some of his snaps and targets. Freiermuth isn’t a must-start but he could be a low-end TE1 in the right situation.

This hasn’t been a great year defensively for the 49ers. You’ve heard about it ad nauseum by now, but they’ve played much of the season without their two best defensive players in Nick Bosa and Fred Warner . Nonetheless, Robert Saleh has cobbled together a top-10 stop unit without a front four that causes many quarterbacks any distress.

The good news for San Francisco is that every defense has caused Cam Ward distress this year. The rookie is tied with Geno Smith as the quarterbacks who have been sacked the most in 2025 -- a mark Ward is likely to own by himself with Smith unlikely to play this week. One thing the Niners have done well lately is force turnovers. Saleh’s group has nabbed seven takeaways in its past three games. That jibes well against an offense that is above league average in giving the ball away. San Francisco is a solid streaming option for the opening of the fantasy playoffs.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/yg2jd7gyymmwfplnmsib,N,,2025-12-12 12:03:12.539472

Both Johnson and Carter were listed as non-participants to begin the week and Dickerson was listed as limited as the Eagles held a Wednesday walkthrough on a short week.

Did not participate: DT Jalen Carter (shoulders), G Landon Dickerson (calf/rest), T Lane Johnson (foot)

Full: LB Zack Baun (hand), LS Charley Hughlett (abdomen), T Cameron Williams (shoulder)

There was some hope that Lane Johnson would be able to return for this game after the Eagles didn’t place him on IR but it’s looking like he won’t be out there against the Raiders on Sunday.

Johnson, 35, suffered a Lisfranc sprain against the Lions on Nov. 16 and has already missed three games. He would have had to miss a minimum of four games had the Eagles put him on IR so there was some optimism he could be back for this game. But now it seems like next week against the Commanders is more realistic.

That means that veteran Fred Johnson is likely going to make his fourth consecutive start if he's healthy enough to go. On Sunday, he’ll be tasked with trying to slow down superstar rusher Maxx Crosby, who plays about 87% of his snaps on the left side of the defensive line.

Fred Johnson lined up at right tackle on Thursday in place of Lane Johnson and Brett Toth was at left guard in place of Dickerson.

Carter, 24, had a procedure on his shoulders last week and missed the Chargers game. He’s in line to miss his second straight game. Without Carter, the Eagles’ defensive line had a great day pressuring Justin Herbert on over 68% of his dropbacks in LA.

The only limited participant to start the week was LG Landon Dickerson (calf). Dickerson missed some snaps with that injury against the Chargers but was able to return in the second half. It’s worth noting that Dickerson did get a rest day last Friday.

Both of the full participants to start the week — LB Zack Baun (hand) and LS Charley Hughlett (abdomen) — were practicing again on Thursday.

The Eagles on Thursday opened the 21-day practice window for sixth-round offensive tackle Cameron Williams, who has been on IR since early in the season. The Eagles previously opened practice windows for fellow rookies Willie Lampkin and Myles Hinton but then shut them both down for the season when their windows expired.

Achane practiced Thursday, as coach Mike McDaniel said he would before the day’s drills, but was limited, according to both McDaniel and the team’s injury report.
“He’ll go through some of his assignments, and he’ll participate but it’ll be limited,” McDaniel said.

Achane practiced Thursday, as coach Mike McDaniel said he would before the day’s drills, but was limited, according to both McDaniel and the team’s injury report.

Achane was wearing a red, non-contact jersey Thursday to avoid aggravation to the rib injury suffered in the second quarter of Sunday’s win at the New York Jets.

“He’ll go through some of his assignments, and he’ll participate but it’ll be limited,” McDaniel said. “It’ll be a gradual increase in activity and physicality.”

Achane hurt his ribs landing on the football he was carrying for a 29-yard gain down the right side on his last rushing attempt against the Jets.

He finished with 92 yards and a touchdown on just seven carries. Jaylen Wright took over after Achane’s departure for his first 100-yard rushing performance and first NFL touchdown.

Protecting his body will be vital against the Steelers, who rank No. 21 against the run.

“The good news is that how he earns a living is avoiding tacklers, and that’s what he’ll have to do,” McDaniel said. “Bumps and bruises, if you don’t have something in December, you’re probably playing football wrong.”

Whether Achane wears a flak jacket will be up to him, according to McDaniel, as the speedy running back appeared to experiment with one at Thursday drills.

“He looked good,” quarterback Tua Tagovailoa said of Achane. “They’re doing what they need to be cautious of him as he’s running the ball, catching.”

Other Dolphins injuries

Two Dolphins missed Thursday practice, and they’re key special teamers: defensive back Elijah Campbell (ankle/knee) and linebacker Caleb Johnson (shoulder).

Johnson is unlikely to play Monday, and Campbell is day to day, per McDaniel.

Linebacker Tyrel Dodson was off the injury report entirely after a hamstring tweak against New York on Sunday that caused him to exit momentarily.

Limited participants at Thursday’s practice were cornerback Rasul Douglas (foot), safety Ifeatu Melifonwu (thumb/groins), outside linebacker Chop Robinson (oblique), tight end Darren Waller (rest), long snapper Joe Cardona (hamstring) and offensive lineman Andrew Meyer (triceps). Meyer participated in his first practice in a designation to return from IR.

Watt hospitalized

The Steelers made a shocking announcement on outside linebacker T.J. Watt on Thursday.

“T.J. Watt is currently in a local hospital for further medical evaluation of his lung after experiencing discomfort at the practice facility on Wednesday,” the Steelers statement said. “He will not be at practice on Thursday, and his status for Monday night’s game vs. Miami is in question. Coach (Mike) Tomlin will provide more updates at the appropriate time.”

Tomlin later told reporters in Pittsburgh he didn’t know what prompted Watt’s lung discomfort and that further evaluation later Thursday would help determine his status.

Watt, who has seven Pro Bowls and four All-Pro selections in his career, leads the Steelers with seven sacks this season.

Also missing practice for the Steelers Thursday were defensive tackle Derrick Harmon (knee), left tackle Andrus Peat (concussion), cornerback James Pierre (calf) and wide receiver Ben Skowronek (hand). Pittsburgh had tight end Darnell Washington and linebacker Malik Harrison as both are navigating concussion protocol.

Tomlin-led Steelers

McDaniel detailed his impression of facing the Steelers under coach Mike Tomlin.

“Twenty years of over-.500 football play,” Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel said of what he sees from the Mike Tomlin-led Steelers. “I mean, that’s been the scope of my career, is being able to inspire a group of individuals to come together and win more than they lose. I think that, within that, there’s a lot of pride in the organization and the team. I think guys play physically every year, regardless of what the nameplates are, and they find a way to play sound football and they become pretty hard to beat.”

Indeed, the Steelers have never finished below .500 under Tomlin, as his team is 7-6 deep into his 19th season.

“I’ve played him multiple times, and it’s always been that same story,” McDaniel said. “You have to go earn a win. It will not be handed to you.”",https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tfl-z-dolphins2-24.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-12-12 07:01:02.818115

The Chiefs’ Thursday practice reports showed offensive linemen Wanya Morris (knee) and Jawaan Taylor (triceps/knee) did not practice, while linebacker Nick Bolton was held out with an illness.

Hollywood Brown returned from a personal day, and Trent McDuffie continued limited work.

The challenge is the timing, as the Los Angeles Chargers (9-4) come into Arrowhead on Sunday and the Chiefs (6-7) have virtually no room left to slip if they want to stay in the playoff hunt.

Morris’ knee injury, sustained in Sunday’s loss to the Houston Texans, has been characterized by multiple outlets as season-ending, removing a rotational lineman who had been pressed into starting work this month.

Taylor, a regular starter on the right side, is dealing with a triceps strain and lingering knee trouble; he missed last Sunday and was again listed as DNP on Thursday, leaving his status for Sunday’s matchup uncertain.

The Chiefs have shuffled their tackle spots all season, and QB Patrick Mahomes has taken 29 sacks — 17th-most in the NFL.

Offensively, Mahomes has thrown for 3,398 passing yards and 22 touchdown passes with a QBR of 69.4, along with 407 rushing yards and four rushing TDs, giving the offense an added dimension.

But the Texans game highlighted how protection issues can snowball into turnovers and stalled drives; Mahomes struggled in the loss (160 yards, three interceptions, no touchdowns), and the ongoing attrition up front only raises the risk of more breakdowns.

With four games remaining (Chargers, Titans, Broncos, Raiders), every week now carries added weight.

""We've been taking the right steps to get back on the field,"" Buckner said.","Colts defensive tackle DeForest Buckner was a limited participant again in practice Thursday, after being limited on Wednesday – which was his first practice since being placed on injured reserve with a neck injury prior to Week 10.

Buckner sustained the injury late in the first half of the Colts' Week 9 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He figured he sustained a stinger, and he returned to the game in the second half.

But by the Wednesday after that game, he had lost all strength in the left side of his upper body. Buckner – one of the strongest players on the Colts – couldn't even do a push-up. A scan was done, and it turned out Buckner had a herniated disc in his neck that was pressing on a nerve.

Buckner knew he'd be out for at least four games, but he also didn't know if he'd need surgery to alleviate the issues he was having. The hope was, with treatment and rehab, his strength would return and he'd be able to avoid surgery.

Buckner flew to Panama to get stem cell injections in his neck – he saw the same doctors, who were recommended to him by a few ex-teammates with the San Francisco 49ers, last year when he was placed on injured reserve with a back injury. And then he began a grueling, lonely rehab process, spending hours at the Indiana Farm Bureau Football Center getting treatment while staying sharp working with his personal coach at Ozwell Fitness in Carmel.

And, eventually, Buckner began feeling better.

""It was definitely challenging day by day, especially early on when I didn't know if I was gonna get my strength back or not,"" Buckner said. ""And it was a process, but I got to a spot where I was consistently getting strength, and obviously that was encouraging and brought a lot more confidence.""

One thing Buckner did make sure of, though, was that he was on the plane with the Colts for road games against the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars. He was on the sidelines for those games, as well as the Colts' Week 13 home game against the Houston Texans, lending a voice when he could. Buckner also would pop into meetings during the week after he was done with treatment to try to help where he could.

""Trying to be a player coach as much as possible, and slash cheerleader,"" Buckner said. ""It's definitely challenging. Being on IR, it can definitely be lonely, frustrating, because you're kind of not part of the team but you are part of the team.""

Buckner still needs to be activated off injured reserve to play, as the Colts opened his 21-day window to begin practicing on Wednesday.

""We've been taking the right steps to get back on the field,"" Buckner said. ""And you guys know how I am, I'm doing whatever I can to be out there on the field. Now that we opened my practice window, just seeing how we go moving forward.""

Just because Buckner can be activated from injured reserve for Week 15 does not mean he's guaranteed to play Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks at Lumen Field. Buckner can be activated off injured reserve any time in the next three weeks, and while he's pushing to get back on the field as soon as possible, on Thursday he remained unsure of when that'll exactly be.

""We're just taking it day by day, seeing how it goes,"" Buckner said. ""Getting acclimated back out there and everything and seeing how my neck responds to consistently getting more volume.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/k5sdap9qzpjw8iqsyajx,N,,2025-12-12 00:00:47.594128

Wide receiver has already been a popular position atop many New Orleans Saints mock drafts. Even here at LouisianaSports.Net, wideouts from Arizona State, Jordyn Tyson and Indiana, Elijah Sarratt, have found their way into the first or second round in draft exercises.

Unfortunately, the pool of top wideouts has now taken a big hit with one prospect familiar with Saints’ rookie quarterback Tyler Shough having suffered a major knee injury.

Per ESPN’s Adam Schefter and Pete Thamel, Louisville wide receiver and Shough’s former teammate Chris Bell suffered a torn ACL.

The two appeared in 12 games together last year, combining for 37 receptions, 677 receiving yards and two touchdown connections. Bell added six receptions for 60 yards to his season total in the team’s bowl game against the Washington Huskies.

Bell produced well in his 11 games in 2025, reeling in 72 receptions for 916 receiving yards and six touchdown catches.

A “clean” ACL tear is typically seen as a more favorable injury than a rupture or incomplete tear. But surgery and recovery time are still substantial. This could potentially keep Bell out for around half of the season in 2026 and is sure to impact his draft stock.

The Saints should absolutely be interested in this year’s talented class of wideouts in the next NFL Draft. But Bell’s name will now carry an injury tag that may make it challenging to consider reuniting Shough with his top option from 2024.",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/3859/files/2025/12/2025-10-18t025641z-1724488589-mt1usatoday27349804-rtrmadp-3-ncaa-football-louisville-at-miami.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 00:00:52.301585

The mini-bye week was supposed to cure most of the teams bumps and bruises but a few injuries continue to linger for this team.

Cornerback Trevon Diggs was among the walking wounded and although he is apparently healthy enough to play, there's a huge question about whether he'll play this week, or any week remaining in the season. Left tackle Tyler Guyton and safety Malik Hooker missed practice, but wideout CeeDee Lamb (concussion) was among several players who hit the field despite injury concerns.

Minnesota, the Cowboys' upcoming opponent, is managing injures of their own as two major players on offense missed practice and 12 others participated in limited fashion mainly for rest. One of those limited players is receiver Jordan Addison who continues to manage the achilles he ruptured that ended his season last year. The Vikings also added linebacker Josh Ross to their roster to help with the final stretch of the season.

Phillip Rivers, 44, suited up for Indianapolis to try and help their fading playoff chances, and seems poised to see his first game action in five seasons. In other league news, the NFL has shortened the time allotment for teams to make their first-round draft picks, hopefully getting folks to bed at a reasonable hour. The league has also backed a new flag football venture. Here's a look at the top news from the Cowboys, Vikings and the NFL as a whole.

The 10-day break between the Lions and Vikings games was advantageous to the star wideout, who said he has not had any symptoms as he has worked through the protocol. He went through a limited part of Wednesday's practice.

Lamb said he saw a replay of the play on which he was concussed.

""It was all over my phone. I couldn't miss it,"" he said. ""I will say: I remember everything. I wasn't -- I don't know, I can't say I wasn't knocked out because clearly I was -- but I remember everything.""

Lamb recently switched helmets and wears a Guardian Cap during practices, but he said he will not wear one in games.

""It's not comfortable,"" he said.

Lamb also defended fellow Cowboys receiver George Pickens, who was criticized for his effort by Amazon Prime analyst Richard Sherman after catching five passes for 37 yards in the loss to the Lions.

""I just feel like they were waiting on him to have a bad game,"" Lamb said. ""It was quiet all season and he was averaging 100 [yards], 110, doing crazy things, but the one opportunity that he get, he didn't step up to their appreciation. And I feel like for us to come out victorious it wasn't just all on him. Once one of us go out, D-coordinators are very smart. It's not like I go out and they stay playing the same coverage. I mean they're going to lean coverage to him. They're going to cheat. They're going to do different things. People are smart. People understand football. I don't know why it's like that, I don't know, people just act like it's just night and day. They got jobs too over there. Them people don't want to get fired and they know if they let G spin by himself somebody's getting fired.""

Pickens has not addressed the media yet this week, but quarterback Dak Prescott said the receiver has been ""amazing.""

""He's responded great. Just came in like a pro, as I expected him to do,"" Prescott said.

""When you're playing to the level he is and to the standard or anybody's expectations when you play the way that he does ... he owns that. He's had a hell of a week of practice, and he's going to continue to finish that way. There's no doubt all that is going to just transpire into the game.""",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1205%2Fr1585169_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-12 00:01:00.218569

Yet, several players will be spending time on the sidelines.

Knowing about injuries to key players is an essential piece for NFL fans and fantasy managers at this time, too. They will want to know who might be out or limited in upcoming games. Here’s a breakdown of notable injuries and what you need to know.

De’Von Achane, RB, Miami Dolphins

Dolphins running back De’Von Achane suffered a rib injury when he fell on the football during Sunday’s victory over the New York Jets. An MRI was done on Achane’s injured ribs, and it didn’t indicate that he’d suffered a fracture.

While no official word on Achane’s condition was released on Tuesday, Achane may sit out a few of this week’s practices ahead of Miami’s game on Monday night against the Pittsburgh Steelers.

If Achane is unavailable for the Monday night game, look for Jaylen Wright to get a few more touches.

According to the PFSN NFL RB Impact metrics, Achane has an impact score of 87.7 and grades out to a B+. For the season, Achane has 193 carries for 1,126 yards and seven touchdowns.

CeeDee Lamb, WR, Dallas Cowboys

Update 12/10: Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb was on the practice field on Wednesday, but has still not fully cleared concussion protocol to return to a game. ESPN NFL Nation Cowboys reporter Todd Archer said that Lamb is trending in the right direction.

Lamb suffered a concussion in Dallas’ loss to the Detroit Lions. No update on Lamb’s condition was available on Tuesday.

Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones, though, did offer an update on Monday. “He’s doing a good job,” Jones said. “He’s meeting all the thresholds that you need to meet that will get him to where he can play this week. So far, he’s had no setbacks.”

According to the PFSN NFL WR Impact metrics, Lamb has an impact score of 85.2 and grades out to a B. For the season, Lamb has 57 catches for 865 yards and three touchdown receptions.

Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan, WRs, Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Update 12/10: On Wednesday, Buccaneers wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan were activated from Injured Reserve, and both players will be available on Thursday night, ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter reported.

The Buccaneers go up against the Atlanta Falcons this week.

Trey Benson, RB, Arizona Cardinals

Updated 12/10: Cardinals running back Trey Benson was not activated by the team on Wednesday. Therefore, his NFL season for 2025 is now over, according to ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter.

Benson has been dealing with a meniscus injury. Benson has not played since Week 4. He will have to be activated this week or will miss the rest of the 2025 season.

On Tuesday, Cardinals head coach Jonathan Gannon offered an update on Benson’s situation in an interview with a Phoenix sports radio station.

“I know he’s doing everything he can to get back out there,” Gannon said. “You know, we opened his window a little bit ago. The return to play, like all return to plays, is not linear. Every guy’s a little bit different. But he’s working at it, and we’re, we got a good plan for him and hopefully can get back out there.”

Alvin Kamara, RB, New Orleans Saints

Update 12/10: Saints running back Alvin Kamara did not practice with the team.

Kamara has missed the last two games with knee and ankle injuries. No update was given on Tuesday regarding Kamara’s status.

On Monday, however, Saints head coach Kellen Moore said, “We’ll see” regarding a return this coming Sunday and considered him “questionable.” The Saints will release their first injury report on Wednesday, at which time further details about Kamara will be available.

According to the PFSN NFL RB Impact metrics, Kamara has an impact score of 70.9 and grades out to a C-. For the season, Kamara has 131 carries for 471 yards and one touchdown.

Jayden Daniels, QB, Washington Commanders

Update 12/10: On Wednesday, Commanders head coach Dan Quinn said that starting quarterback Jayden Daniels, who is dealing with his injured left elbow, will not be cleared by doctors to play this week.

Marcus Mariota gets the start against the New York Giants on Sunday, according to Pelissero.

Drake London, WR, Atlanta Falcons

Update 12/10: On Wednesday, Falcons wide receiver Drake London was ruled out of Thursday night’s game against Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, according to Pelissero.

Patrick Mahomes, QB, Kansas City Chiefs

Update 12/10: On Wednesday, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was a full participant in the Chiefs’ practice. Mahomes was hobbled late in Sunday’s loss to the Houston Texans with a left knee issue, according to NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero.

Trevor Lawrence, QB, Jacksonville Jaguars

Update 12/10: On Wednesday, Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence was limited in practice due to an ankle injury, Pelissero reported.

Lamar Jackson, QB, Baltimore Ravens

Update 12/10: On Wednesday, Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson had a non-injury-related rest day. Pelissero reported, “So Lamar’s ankle (and everything else) is apparently healthy. He’s just still not practicing in full ahead of Sunday’s game at Cincinnati.”

Woody Marks and Nick Chubb, RBs, Houston Texans

Update 12/10: On Wednesday, Texans running backs Woody Marks and Nick Chubb did not practice with the team. Marks is dealing with a knee injury, while Chubb has injured ribs, according to NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero.

Riley Leonard, Brett Rypien, and Daniel Jones, QBs, and Chris Lammons, CB, Indianapolis Colts

Update 12/10: On Wednesday, Colts quarterback Riley Leonard, who has been dealing with a knee injury, was listed as a full participant at Colts practice, according to NFL Network Insider Tom Pelissero and ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter.

Also on Wednesday, the Colts signed quarterback Brett Rypien to the 53-man roster along with kicker Blake Grupe from the team’s practice squad, Schefter reported. Cornerback Charvarius Ward Sr. was put on Injured Reserve because of another concussion.

Colts starting quarterback Daniel Jones, who suffered a torn Achilles on Sunday, has been placed on injured reserve, according to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport.

Also on Tuesday, the Colts signed veteran quarterback Philip Rivers to the practice squad, with the possibility of his promotion to the main roster. Meanwhile, cornerback Chris Lammons, who has a foot injury, was also placed on injured reserve Tuesday.

It takes a true outlier event, a stunningly bad beat or a historically improbable win, for a betting memory to become a “where were you” moment. And while most normal sports fans will forget about Daniel Carlson’s 46-yard field goal as time expired in the Raiders’ 24-17 loss to the Broncos last Sunday, I will remember and cherish that kick forever.

It was one of the most improbable betting wins of my life. I called Cousin Sal in excitement to talk about how we had just pulled off an incredible gambling heist. I’ll probably never understand why Pete Carroll chose to kick that field goal. Or why Broncos safety Brandon Jones lay on top of Raiders receiver Tyler Lockett when time was about to expire. All I know is that the Raiders lost by fewer than 7.5 points. He might not be in the job for much longer, but Sunday was the moment that Carroll truly became Las Vegas’s football coach.

Now that we’re onto Week 15, bye weeks are over. This is the final normal scheduling week of the NFL regular season. That means 16 games, a loaded Sunday slate, and, unfortunately, some very one-sided matchups on paper.

Here are my thoughts on the entire Week 15 slate, including my favorite five bets. (All lines are from FanDuel as of Thursday morning.)

The Favorite Five

I’ll be highlighting my favorite five picks each week throughout the season, which will serve as a preview for my picks on The Ringer 107—a season-long contest between The Bill Simmons Podcast, The Ringer NFL Show, The Ringer Gambling Show, and The Ringer Fantasy Football Show. I’ll be partnering with Cousin Sal to make the Gambling Show’s Friday picks. Through 14 weeks, this column is 52-54-1 overall and 33-37 on the Favorite Five.

Buffalo Bills (–1.5) at New England Patriots

Like the Broncos, the Patriots are another team with an excellent record, and the betting market continues to be skeptical about this team. It’s highly unusual that the Broncos and Pats, the top two seeds in the current AFC playoff picture, both of which have multiple game leads over everyone else in the conference, would be home underdogs in the same week. Even though the Patriots dismantled the shoddy Giants defense with a superb Drake Maye performance the last time we saw them play, I think that it’s time for Buffalo to get its revenge for their first meeting earlier this season.

Let’s start with my concerns about New England: The Patriots run defense has been slipping in recent weeks. Before Milton Williams’s injury, New England had a top five run defense in rushing success rate allowed (Weeks 1-10). Since Williams left the Jets game with an injury in Week 11, the Patriots have slipped to 28th. The post-injury sample is admittedly only three games, but there have been real cracks in the foundation that Buffalo will be looking to exploit through James Cook and the power run game.

The Patriots have also struggled in the red zone, and that’s an area where Buffalo has a definite advantage because of its ability to unleash Josh Allen as a runner. The Patriots rank 24th in red zone touchdown percentage, while Buffalo sits at ninth. Against the Bengals in Week 12, the Patriots’ red zone issues nearly cost them late in the game, and it could happen again in another high-leverage close game. Their struggles stem from their inability to consistently run the ball.

Verdict: Bet Bills moneyline (–115)

Green Bay Packers (–2.5) at Denver Broncos

The Broncos and Packers enter Week 15 with two of the league’s three best defenses when it comes to preventing explosive plays. Both defenses excel at tackling underneath and have such dominant pass rushes that it’s difficult to consistently push the ball down the field or generate yards after the catch against them. Sunday will be a battle of which offense is able to be more methodical about moving the ball down the field with consistent first downs. Green Bay has had a few puzzling offensive performances this year, but the Packers are more reliable in series conversion rate—a metric that examines how often an offense moves the chains. The Packers rank fifth, while the Broncos sit at 19th.

The Broncos defense plays a lot of man coverage, and Jordan Love has been the league’s most efficient quarterback against that type of coverage. Love tries to push the ball downfield as much as any quarterback in the NFL, too, but Denver won’t make that as easy as Chicago did last week.

Despite Denver’s impressive 11-2 record, the betting markets still don’t believe that it is a truly elite team. The Broncos are the 11th-best team based on betting market odds, which is why they are a home underdog to Green Bay (third) by nearly a field goal.

Verdict: Bet under 43.5 (–110)

Cleveland Browns at Chicago Bears (–7.5)

If you’re the kind of person who believes in trap games, there’s no better example of a bad situational spot for a team than the Bears’ home game against Cleveland on Sunday. The lowly Browns come to Chicago and catch the Bears in the middle of their Green Bay twofer. One week after a heartbreaking last-minute loss, Chicago surely has one eye on the rematch with its rival at Soldier Field next week, which could very well decide the NFC North title.

The Bears should win this game. But this is still the first time all season that they have been favored by more than a touchdown. Chicago has vastly improved from Week 1 to now, but it is not without flaws. The passing game is not consistent. The pass rush ranks 28th in pressure rate. The Bears have been the late-game darlings of the NFL this year, but winning by margin doesn’t come easily to them.

The Browns defense might not be as dominant away from home, but this remains a good matchup for their run defense, which can slow Chicago down and keep the game within a score. Chicago does have the fifth-highest rush rate, and the steady improvement and recent explosion of their run game has been the primary driver of their 9-4 record. But Cleveland ranks first in the NFL in rushing success rate allowed.

Verdict: Bet Browns +7.5 (–110)

Las Vegas Raiders at Philadelphia Eagles (–11.5)

A wise man would not be dying to jump back in to bet on the Raiders after their absolute miracle cover on Sunday. A wise man would take the money he made last week and run. But I am not a wise man. And I am not sure that this price can be justified given the current state of the Eagles offense. The Eagles have played 13 football games this season, and they have been above average in EPA per drive in only three of them. Their offense cannot consistently move the ball and is heavily reliant on explosive plays to be successful.

The Raiders defense is not good, but it is sixth best at preventing big plays. Defensive coordinator Patrick Graham likes to sit in zone defense and keep his safeties high. Last year, the Eagles would have been able to run the ball effectively and force Graham to change his looks. They have not shown that they can do that this season.

If you can stomach a bet on the Raiders and Kenny Pickett, I’d consider the under instead, but the Eagles need to prove that they can win by margin first. They’ve won one game all season by multiple scores.

Verdict: Bet Raiders +11.5 (–110)

Los Angeles Chargers at Kansas City Chiefs (–5.5)

The Chargers pulled out the win against the Eagles in dramatic fashion on Monday night, but it’s hard to feel good about how their offense looked after a clearly hampered Justin Herbert finished 12-of-26, with just 5.3 yards per attempt. Herbert’s accuracy seemed limited by his left hand injury, and while he scrambled for 66 yards to keep the offense afloat, the constant pressure on him will likely continue to affect his performance. Herbert was pressured on 63.4 percent of his dropbacks on Monday night, and he had multiple turnovers. Now, he’ll face a defense that will bring pressure as much as possible. A healthy Herbert with a nearly full-strength offensive line carved open the Chiefs defense in the first week of the season, but now they’re facing a much different challenge at a raucous Arrowhead Stadium.

It seems like the dam could break for the Chargers offense in this game. They’ve kept afloat in most games—Jacksonville in Week 12 aside—since Joe Alt got injured again. But how long can they keep sustaining the offense with turnstile offensive lineman who are allowing absurd pressure rates?

I hate to sound like a broken record in this column, but the market continues to have immense respect for the quality and pedigree of the Chiefs. The betting markets still rate the Chiefs as the best team in the AFC, even if it is highly unlikely that they’ll make the playoffs now. If you were hoping for a discount to bet Kansas City, the betting markets won’t give you one.

The path to beating the Chargers defense is committing to the run game and methodically moving the ball. I’m not sure that the Chiefs can do the first part without making this game quite slow and low scoring.

Verdict: Bet under 41.5 (–110)

Thursday Night Football

Atlanta Falcons at Tampa Bay Buccaneers (–4.5)

It would be easy to call this a must-win for the Buccaneers, but the reality is that their season will come down to their two matchups against Carolina in Weeks 16 and 18. The Bucs are activating wide receivers Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan from injured reserve before this game. I suspect that they are trying to ease Evans and McMillan in so that both will be ready for the more important upcoming games.

This Tampa Bay season started with a ton of promise; Baker Mayfield was rescuing a bunch of games in the final moments, but he’s been one of the worst quarterbacks in the entire league since Week 7. Some of that is certainly a result of all the injuries to the skill group and maybe even an injury to Mayfield himself, but we’re at a point where Tampa Bay is extremely vulnerable week to week. I still want to keep fading the Buccaneers until Mayfield shows the league that he can put together a consistent four-quarter performance again.

The Falcons enter this game shorthanded on offense, as wide receiver Drake London is out yet again and tight end Kyle Pitts is questionable. But schematically, this is a great matchup for Bijan Robinson in the receiving game. The Bucs love to bring pressure, but Kirk Cousins has held up well against the blitz, and the Bucs are allowing the most receiving yards in the league to running backs.

Verdict: Bet Falcons +4.5 (–110) and Bijan Robinson over 36.5 receiving yards (–110)

The Rest of the Slate

Indianapolis Colts at Seattle Seahawks (–13.5)

Look, I’m not saying that I want to bet on some combination of Philip Rivers, Riley Leonard, and Brett Rypien at quarterback on Sunday. But it’s really hard to justify the market laying this many points on Seattle. The look-ahead line was Seattle –3.5. Even with the acknowledgment that look-ahead lines don’t have high liquidity and aren’t the best barometer of the real betting market, it’s quite a drastic one-week adjustment for this spread to jump 10 points. That said, the Colts will be without their top corners, as Charvarius Ward and Sauce Gardner are out, and they’ll have to protect their quarterback of choice without right tackle Braden Smith, who is in concussion protocol.

If the Colts do start Rivers, who practiced on Wednesday, it would basically be unprecedented. The only other quarterback who’s returned from a five-year hiatus to play football was Steve DeBerg in 1998. Forty-four-year-old DeBerg rejoined the Atlanta Falcons as the backup quarterback that season and finished 9-of-17, with two turnovers and three sacks, in his lone start. Even if Rivers and head coach Shane Steichen remain close friends who talk football all the time, there has to be some learning curve if you’re walking into an NFL offense during a game week and playing on Sunday. But Rivers might still be the best option if the alternative is a physically compromised Leonard (who has a knee injury).

This is a fascinating football experiment and a compelling human interest story. I might even find myself betting the Colts on the moneyline just in case Rivers does get the start. But much like we saw with the Vikings’ Max Brosmer start against Seattle two weeks ago, there’s a ton of variance in possible outcomes, and it’s worth investing in alternate spreads, depending on whether you think Phil can still sling it.

You also have to wonder whether the Seahawks will have one eye on their critical division clash against the Rams coming up on Thursday.

Verdict: Bet on alternate spreads in either direction, depending on whether you want to hate- or nostalgia-watch Rivers

Arizona Cardinals at Houston Texans (-9.5)

Five weeks ago, the Texans season was on life support; they sat at 3-5 following a loss at home to the Broncos. Houston had just lost starting quarterback C.J. Stroud to a concussion and faced a gauntlet of an upcoming schedule. The underlying metrics always suggested that Houston was better than its record, and as it turns out, everyone—including the betting markets—was underrating the Texans. Houston has won five in a row (and covered the spread in four), beating the Jaguars, Titans, Bills, Colts, and Chiefs to surge into the heart of the AFC South race.

Given the current state of the AFC—both the Chiefs and Ravens are in grave danger of missing the playoffs altogether—how many teams in the conference are definitely better than Houston? The offensive line went from abysmal to passable. The offense is hardly consistent, but running back Woody Marks and wide receiver Nico Collins have just enough explosive spark to put some points on the board consistently. Given that Houston’s defense is the best by EPA per drive of any unit since 2021, the offense doesn’t have to score much for the Texans to be a tough team to beat in the AFC playoffs.

Could this game serve as a bit of a breakout for the Houston offense? It’s one thing to struggle on the road against playoff-caliber defenses, but we have seen that when Stroud faces a defense that doesn’t generate much pressure, the offense becomes highly efficient. Houston moved the ball up and down the field against the very injured Ravens and 49ers defenses and now gets to face another shorthanded unit this Sunday. The Cardinals rank 27th in pressure rate, so Stroud should be kept relatively clean.

I wouldn't be surprised if Houston scores more than anticipated, but I’ll pass here.

Verdict: Pass

Tennessee Titans at San Francisco 49ers (–13.5)

Only the Panthers generate pressure at a lower rate than the San Francisco 49ers. The Niners posted quality defensive showings against Carolina and Cleveland over the past two weeks, but their underlying vulnerability remains. It’s next to impossible for me to lay that many points on a defense that creates so little havoc. Even if the Titans don’t score a lot of points, they should be able to move the ball somewhat consistently in this game, bleed the clock, and stay competitive. One of Cam Ward’s biggest problems has been his sack rate. That concern is somewhat alleviated by a matchup with this San Francisco defense.

Friends usually don’t let friends bet on the Titans, but they can also prevent you from laying nearly two touchdowns on a very flawed defense.

Verdict: Lean Titans +13.5 (–110)

Minnesota Vikings at Dallas Cowboys (-6.5)

The haters wrote J.J. McCarthy off this season. But last week, against the Commanders, he didn’t write back.

McCarthy had by far his best game as a professional quarterback last week and finally made the bettors who’d been blindly fading him pay up. On paper, Minnesota’s skill position players against the Dallas secondary is one of the biggest mismatches of the entire season. The Cowboys run defense may be improved, but their secondary still has serious holes that can be exploited by a capable offense.

On the other side, we’ve seen Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores get the better of plenty of great quarterbacks, but it will be difficult for him to scheme up pressure to rattle Dak Prescott. Prescott, especially at home, is elite at diagnosing defenses pre-snap. He excels against the blitz, has two elite wide receivers (when George Pickens cares), and loves to throw over the middle of the field. Flores's defenses will leave the middle open, and Prescott is sure to throw into the windows vacated by extra rushers. He ranks fourth in success rate against the blitz this season.

This has all the makings of a high-scoring matchup, if McCarthy can exploit a bad secondary.

Verdict: Lean over 47.5 (–110)

New York Jets at Jacksonville Jaguars (–13.5)

There are too many games with real intrigue and consequence in Week 15 for me to dive deep into a December matchup that might be started by Jets rookie QB Brady Cook. After a week of national media gushing about Trevor Lawrence, it would be very fitting if this game were close in the fourth quarter, even if it shouldn’t be.

Verdict: Pass

Carolina Panthers (–2.5) at New Orleans Saints

Tyler Shough had a ton of success in his first meeting with Carolina on the road this season, in part because the Panthers are dead last in pressure rate in the NFL. Shough threw for 282 yards on 27 attempts, and the Saints shut down the Carolina offense en route to a comfortable 17-7 win. Last week, we even saw a different dimension of the Saints rookie quarterback when he added two touchdowns with his legs. This is as friendly of a matchup as you can draw up for Shough, and I think that the Saints will be a very lively home underdog on Sunday as a result. Like the Buccaneers, the Panthers have a more important game coming up next Sunday.

While Carolina does have a rest advantage coming off the bye, it offers a pretty simple matchup for New Orleans to solve right now. If you can effectively stop the run and force Bryce Young into obvious passing downs, you can slow down the Panthers offense. New Orleans ranks 10th in rush success rate allowed, and Young is 41st out of 44 quarterbacks in EPA per dropback in obvious passing situations (third or fourth down and 6-plus yards).

Verdict: Bet Saints ML (+120)

Washington Commanders at New York Giants (–2.5)

Both teams began with varying degrees of promise but have quickly devolved as they've been infected by the injury bug. Jayden Daniels has more notable injuries than wins this season, and this hollowed-out version of the Giants offense without running back Cam Skattebo and wide receiver Malik Nabers is lacking any juice.

There is a case to be made right now that Marcus Mariota is running the Commanders offense better than Daniels was and that their run game should be able to move the ball against the porous Giants run defense. Even when teams have nothing to play for, you would expect the Commanders to respond after their absolute shellacking in Minnesota last week. Teams are 97-68-4 all time against the spread (59 percent) following a loss of 30-plus points, per Action Network.

Verdict: Lean Commanders +2.5, bet at +3

Baltimore Ravens (-2.5) at Cincinnati Bengals

These two teams played on Thanksgiving, and the Ravens closed as a 7.5-point favorite. The Bengals ended up winning comfortably in Baltimore, and both teams lost close coin-flip games last week. The question you have to answer now is whether it makes sense for oddsmakers to downgrade the Ravens by two or three points.

Given the current state of both Lamar Jackson and the Ravens pass rush, I think that the adjustment is correct. The Ravens were completely unable to pressure Aaron Rodgers effectively last week, and the Steelers had five plays of 20-plus yards. In the 12 weeks before that game, the Steelers offense had 30 total.

Until we see a healthier and more mobile version of Jackson, it’ll be hard to bet money on the Ravens. However, there’s a way to target Cincinnati’s awful tight end coverage by betting on the Ravens’ three tight ends—Isaiah Likely, Mark Andrews, and even Charlie Kolar—in the prop markets. Baltimore and Likely will be out to right a wrong after he fumbled while running into the end zone in that crucial Thanksgiving-night first half.

Verdict: Pass the game, but bet Likely to score a touchdown (+260)

Detroit Lions at Los Angeles Rams (–5.5)

The Rams’ slipup against the Panthers on the road two weeks ago was more a product of some poor plays by Matthew Stafford than an indication of true flaws within the roster. Stafford and his offense proved that when they pummeled the Cardinals last week, and the betting market now sees the Rams as the best team in the NFL. The Lions still have a quality run defense that can slow down the emerging one-two punch of running backs Kyren Williams and Blake Corum, but the Lions’ problems in this matchup are in the secondary. We know that Detroit likes to play a lot of man coverage, and the Rams rank third in the NFL in EPA per dropback against man coverage. The Packers and Cowboys are both in the top six in the same metric, and they just combined to score 61 points in two games against Kelvin Sheppard’s defense.

I’m not really sure what the Lions’ path is to get any real stops in this game, unless Stafford throws the ball to the other team a couple of times. I’d be tempted to play the over, assuming the Lions get extremely pass heavy while they’re trailing, but this total is 54.5 for a reason.

If I had to bet this, I’d lay the points with the Rams. But I don’t have to, so it’s just a lean to their side for me.

Verdict: Lean Rams –5.5 (–110)

Miami Dolphins at Pittsburgh Steelers (–3.5)

Mike Tomlin needs only two more victories to secure yet another winning season in Pittsburgh, and this is a prime opportunity for him to move one step closer. Aaron Rodgers had one of his best games of the season last week and completed four passes of 20 yards or more.

The Steelers had an uncharacteristically explosive showing last week, but both of these offenses love to use the short pass underneath to move the football consistently and methodically. Rodgers and Tua Tagovailoa are in the bottom six among QBs this year in average depth of target, yet it’s Pittsburgh whose defense is considerably better at defending against these types of passes.

The Steelers rank 14th in EPA per dropback allowed on passes within 5 yards of the line of scrimmage, while the Dolphins are way down at 28th. If this becomes a dink-and-dunk battle, I may trust the schematic chops of Mike McDaniel more, but I favor the talent and production of the Steelers. At 3.5, I’d lean with Miami, but not enough to bet on it.

Verdict: Lean Dolphins +3.5 (–105)

The Favorite Five

Bills ML (-115)

Raiders +11.5 (–110)

Browns +7.5 (–110)

Chargers-Chiefs under 41.5 (–110)

Packers-Broncos under 43.5 (º110)

On top of starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr. being out for the season after undergoing knee surgery, the Falcons are just 4-9 at the time of this writing. They have lost seven of their last nine games, with no real end in sight to their on-field woes. But divisional games are different. Divisional games are an opportunity to spoil a rival's season and play for pride. That's the exact opportunity the Falcons have ahead of them in Thursday night's game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

It remains to be seen whether they will be entirely healthy for the game, though. (Outside of Penix, obviously.)

Starting tight end Kyle Pitts is listed as questionable for the game with a knee injury. Not having Pitts available, who has 62 catches for 631 yards this season, in a matchup where receiver Drake London has already been ruled out, would be a huge blow to Atlanta's chances of winning:

Pitts is the Falcons' second-leading pass-catcher this season. His status for the game may determine whether Atlanta's offense is coherent enough to pull off an upset of the Buccaneers.

Outside linebacker Harold Landry III did not participate in Thursday’s practice. The veteran starter, who leads the team in sacks, tackles for loss and quarterback hits, had been available for the previous session in a limited capacity while managing a knee injury.

Running back Terrell Jennings also remained sidelined for the active roster as the AFC East rematch nears.

Here’s the second injury report heading into Sunday’s 1 p.m. ET kickoff at Gillette Stadium.

Jennings has resided in the NFL’s concussion protocol since the final game before the bye week. The sophomore running back and kickoff returner headed from the blue medical tent to the locker room in the first half against the New York Giants. He was downgraded to out for the rest of what became a 33-15 Monday night win. As for Landry, the March arrival off the edges played a season-low 31 defensive snaps as the calendar flipped to December. Coming out of the break, No. 2 has been spotted during one practice in Foxborough.

Two Patriots practiced in a partial capacity on Thursday. Lowe, fresh off his first start of the year at left tackle, continues to work through an abdomen issue.

Buccaneers all-time leading receiver Mike Evans is among the many injured playmakers this season for Tampa Bay. Evans has been out of action since suffering a broken collarbone in the team's loss to the Detroit Lions on ""Monday Night Football"" in Week 7.

The Bucs host the Atlanta Falcons (4-9) on ""Thursday Night Football"" on Thursday, Dec. 11. The question remaining is whether the star wide receiver will make his return.

Evans has been on injured reserve (IR) and had his practice window opened on Dec. 3 ahead of Week 14. He has logged limited practices every day since and the Buccaneers had 21 days to activate him from the time they opened his practice window.

Tampa Bay enters Week 15 with a 7-6 record – in the fourth spot in the NFC playoff picture – leaving little room for error. They are battling to stay atop the NFC South race and Bucs fans are hopeful their All-Pro wide receiver will be available today.

Here's the latest on Evans before the ""Thursday Night Football"" kickoff against the Falcons.

Mike Evans injury update

The Buccaneers have not yet announced whether their top wide receiver will be back in action for tonight's game against the Falcons. He was activated from Injured Reserve on Wednesday, opening the door for a potential return.

In the absence of any official news, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported that Evans is ""good to go"" for the Week 15 ""Thursday Night Football"" game against the Falcons. The veteran wideout will make his return from a broken collarbone after a six-game stint on injured reserve.

The NFC South leaders have been battered by injuries, but they have found ways to win despite the absence of some of their top players.

Evans has missed nine games this season, missing six of those since suffering the broken collarbone and he can now return to action tonight.

Evans practiced in a limited capacity for the second consecutive week and his status for tonight's game is still undetermined. An announcement may not come until the team announces its inactive players for ""Thursday Night Football"".

At the time of Evans' injury, it was reported he could return in December, and he has been on track to do so. The original timeline for return was about two months with no setbacks after Evans underwent surgery to repair the clavicle fracture, which the NFL Network described as a ""clean break.""

The eight-week timeline from the injury would have Evans on track to return for Week 15, when the Buccaneers host the Falcons on ""Thursday Night Football"" on Dec. 11, or in Week 16, when they play on the road against the Panthers on Dec. 21.

The Buccaneers remain in first place in the NFC South entering Week 15 but the Carolina Panthers are right on their heels with an identical record of 7-6. Tampa Bay would certainly stand to benefit if Evans can return during their playoff push during the final weeks of the regular season.

The Buccaneers' receiving group has dealt with many injuries this season. Rookies Egbuka and Tez Johnson have stepped up while Evans, McMillan and Godwin have been sidelined.

Godwin has played the last three games but has not topped a 70% snap rate in any. Meanwhile, McMillan also had his 21-day practice window opened on Dec. 3 and continues to log limited practices. He was activated from IR alongside Evans. Additionally, Shepard - the 10-year veteran - has provided some consistency and depth.

And as he reflects on it further, the gravity of that moment settles in, and a cooler, wiser head prevails.
""Obviously, when you have to go to the tent, it was very clear you did not want to leave the game,"" he said.
Loving what he's seeing from Lamb after such a terrifying moment is his quarterback and one of his best friends, Dak Prescott, who also offered up words of praise and encouragement.
""Yeah, zero concern [about Lamb now],"" the All-Pro QB said.","FRISCO, Texas — The moment was a terrifying one for all who watched helplessly as CeeDee Lamb's helmet banged against the turf at Ford Field last week, the Dallas Cowboys' All-Pro wide receiver blacking out for a moment as his fingers locked, similar to what was witnessed on multiple occasions by Tua Tagovailoa, and it was immediately known he suffered a concussion against the Detroit Lions.

He was immediately removed from the contest and ruled out with said concussion, but he's made significant progress toward potentially clearing the league's protocol to take the field in Week 15 against the Minnesota Vikings.

""There's been a lot of work and eye discipline, and trying to frustrate myself, essentially, to see if I have any more residuals of the concussion, and any type of symptoms,"" said the four-time Pro Bowler. ""But as for me, now, it's just been heavy on rest, to be honest. I'm doing everything, meeting all my requirements, getting ahead of everything, and especially with the extra two to three days that we had off — I feel like that was big.""

As with most NFL athletes, being removed from the field, and particularly when they're on their way to having a career game, isn't something they take kindly to. Lamb was no different, trying to stick around to help the struggling Cowboys' offense avoid the eventual defeat in the Motor City, but he readily admits the neurologist and training staff saved him from himself in that situation.

And as he reflects on it further, the gravity of that moment settles in, and a cooler, wiser head prevails.

""Obviously, when you have to go to the tent, it was very clear you did not want to leave the game,"" he said. ""Is there also a part of you that's glad that those are in place to protect you from yourself and your future in football? Yeah, absolutely. They're doing their job, and obviously, me as a competitor, I want to do mine.

""But it's times where they do have to protect me from me, and that was the situation to where that was one of them. I felt like I was having a pretty good game. I was just kinda getting started — getting to cooking — and for me to really take myself out .. just putting myself out there, and I feel like, just giving my guys my all.

""… I'm happy for the training staff. I'm happy for everybody that's reached out. I'm happy for really just another opportunity of waking up and doing what I love again.""

Lamb made it to the team's charter flight to depart with his teammates, and with no assistance needed, bags or otherwise, then showing up to work out on Monday, and he's since returned to full practice duties — effective Thursday — more great signs that he does have ""only one or two"" more benchmarks to clear, per head coach Brian Schottenheimer, before being released from the league's concussion protocol.

Loving what he's seeing from Lamb after such a terrifying moment is his quarterback and one of his best friends, Dak Prescott, who also offered up words of praise and encouragement.

""Yeah, zero concern [about Lamb now],"" the All-Pro QB said. ""Obviously, on the field, you see a guy, whatever they call that, you know when his hands get into that [locked] formation, right? Whether it's your brother, teammate, or somebody on the other team, you don't want to see that. So, yeah, obviously, there is some urgency to get him help right then.

""But then, actually, when I got over there, he was almost like right back to it. I was like, 'You good?' And he's like, 'Yeah.' … I was positive in the way that he would respond, and he's been great.""

With only a couple days remaining before the Vikings march onto the field at AT&T Stadium, Lamb is on the right track, and a deep exhale is a justified response by all — a close call that turned out to be nothing more than that.",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cowboys/bstxrtlxwn91jze6ava1,N,,2025-12-11 18:02:31.282611

He will not be at practice on Thursday, and his status for Monday night's game vs. Miami is in question. Coach Tomlin will provide more updates at the appropriate time.""

There was a myriad of players who didn't work, as Coach Mike Tomlin indicated many would be limited to start the week.

""Certainly, we have several guys in the concussion protocol,"" said Tomlin. We'll let that process run its course and the medical experts will be center stage in determining availability of those guys. Those guys are (Andrus) Peat, Malik Harrison, Darnell Washington.

""We have some other guys who got banged up during the course of play. Keeanu Benton had an ankle. He was able to go back and finish. I'm sure that will limit him some at the early portions of this week. James Pierre suffered a calf injury. He was able to finish but could impact him at the early portions of this week. Ben Skowronek, Yahya Black, and some others.""

One player who could be looked at as the arrow is pointing up is safety Kyle Dugger, after he missed the Ravens game.

""Kyle Dugger has a chance to come back this week from his hand injury, and the rest are bumps and bruises associated with play,"" said Tomlin.

Tomlin shared more information on receiver DK Metcalf, who remained in Baltimore overnight on Sunday for observation.

""He got hit in the abdomen or stomach in-game,"" said Tomlin. ""I think they gave him some basic over-the-counter remedies in-game, like Pepto, and it got probably progressively worse after the game.

""So, appreciative of our medical experts. We just exercised an abundance of caution. We didn't want to get him in the air without having a complete understanding about what he was dealing with, and they did a good job of that.

""He's moving in the right direction. I don't think it's going to jeopardize his availability at all, but it certainly may jeopardize his availability at the early portions of the week from a practice standpoint.

""Thankfully, he's fine. I'm appreciative of our medical staff and how quickly they acted in making sure he was safe and taking care of him postgame.""

Rookie defensive lineman Derrick Harmon has missed the last two games with a knee injury, but he is working his way back to the lineup.

""Derrick Harmon will be limited at the early portions of the week, and we'll let the amount of participation and how quickly it picks up and the quality of that participation as we go through the week to determine whether or not he's available,"" said Tomlin. ""Certainly excited about additional day as it pertains to him.""

With the Monday night game, the Steelers have an extra day for players to bounce back from injuries.

""Thankful that we have an additional 24 hours or so plus this week,"" said Tomlin. ""That's why we adjusted our schedules in the way that we've done. Sometimes when we play on Monday, particularly at the early stages of team development, we'll do Friday twice and hit a lot of or situational football and really get solid on some of that stuff.

""We just deemed it appropriate to give ourselves another additional 24 hours of recovery this week, and so that's why we've taken the approach that we've taken this week.

""Hopefully we'll get better clarity regarding some player availability. We'll give guys some additional time to rest and recuperate and be able to put their hand in the pile in terms of participating in the process of the game readiness, and certainly it's important this time of year that we have that as the road gets narrow.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/steelers/mgdlvcfcmimziiv3dffu,N,,2025-12-11 17:03:21.218809

Tyson is projected as a first-round pick with the potential to be the first wide receiver off the board, pacing receivers according to three of ESPN’s four analysts in position rankings posted on Nov. 25.

Despite missing 3.5 games this season, the redshirt junior ranks top five among Big 12 receivers in catches (61, fourth) and touchdown receptions (eight, T-5). He is 12th in yards with 711.

Injuries, such as a hamstring strain he suffered on Oct. 18 against Texas Tech and another apparent lower-body injury in the Territorial Cup, prevented him from having the season he envisioned.

NFL teams evaluating Tyson will also remember the collarbone injury that caused him to miss the 2024 postseason, as well as the knee issues that kept him off the field for most of the 2023 season.

Prior to the collarbone injury, Tyson was leading all of college football in receiving yards for the back half of the regular season (729) and had built a close connection with quarterback Sam Leavitt.

The big key for him entering the 2025 season was to cut down on drops after he had seven in 2024 and had five as a freshman in 2022 (no catches on four targets in 2023 when he battled injuries). He did so successfully with just one drop this season.

Tyson has also bulked up to NFL size over his three years at ASU, growing 1 inch to 6-foot-2 and getting up to 200 pounds after arriving to the program at 185 pounds.

The receiver has had the luxury of developing under wide receivers coach Hines Ward, who has helped Tyson refine his discipline, work habits and overall approach.

But when the 44-year-old quarterback answered a call from Indianapolis Colts head coach Shane Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard on Sunday night, he realized that wasn’t what their challenge would most require.

A quarterback who knew the playbook? Rivers spent nine years with Steichen as members of the Chargers then a 10th and final NFL season with Ballard and the Colts in 2020. Have a sense of the roster? Rivers said at his (re-)introductory media conference Wednesday that he's rejoining 14 players who he played alongside with the 2020 Colts, including offensive starters in running back Jonathan Taylor, receiver Michael Pittman Jr. and tight end Mo Alie-Cox.

So when Steichen and Ballard asked, “Hey, what do you think?” Rivers couldn’t help but be interested. They told him to sleep on the decision, and he awoke Monday more adamant.

A flight to Indianapolis and a throwing session helped seal the deal. By Tuesday, from his hotel room, Steichen said Rivers told Colts brass: “Dadgummit, let’s freaking go.” Wednesday morning, the Colts announced they had signed Rivers to the practice squad.

“I'm not here to stinking save the year or be a hero by any means,” Rivers said. “We got to stinking run the crap out of the football and play defense and do all those things. So if that comes to be, and I'm the one that's out there, I'm not here to try to save the day. I'm going to know where I'm limited. And as we go, it will get better, if that's the route we end up going.

“I ain't never ran away from anybody anyway. People say, ‘Well, they're going to know you're going to be right there.’ And it's like, ‘Well, they knew that for 16, 17 years.’”

The Colts’ decision to unretire Rivers five years after his last NFL action is atypical. But so, too, was their predicament.

Advertisement

Starting quarterback Daniel Jones, who had led the Colts to a surprise 8-2 start, went from declining play due to a broken left fibula to injured reserve with a right torn Achilles. The quarterback Jones beat out in the preseason, 2023 fourth overall draft pick Anthony Richardson Sr., has yet to be cleared by doctors after sustaining an orbital fracture in a freak accident warming up for an October game. Sixth-round rookie quarterback Riley Leonard relieved Jones last Sunday — but began to realize on the plane Sunday and into Monday that he’d hurt his knee.

Leonard was able to practice Wednesday but has not yet been guaranteed his availability for a Sunday matchup vs. the 10-3 Seattle Seahawks.

And the Colts do not appear to have much confidence in journeyman Brett Rypien, also under contract.

So what does a team with three injured quarterbacks and a playoff berth slipping but not yet out of reach do?

Remember, this is the same franchise that plucked former offensive lineman Jeff Saturday off the ESPN airwaves to serve as its interim head coach in 2022, when Frank Reich was fired.

Longtime Colts members knew better than to be surprised.

“I’ve learned over the years to expect the unexpected,” linebacker Zaire Franklin, an eight-year Colt, said. “Unusual circumstances called for unusual answers. Thankful that we got a guy who knows the system, that knows the building, that knows the guy [and] is able to step in and help us right away.

“It is a crazy situation.”

Rivers and Leonard may be 22 years apart — but Colts’ QB room isn’t as random as you think

It would be fair for Leonard to have questions about the Colts bringing in a 44-year-old who hasn’t played in five years to challenge him for Sunday’s starting job.

In relief of Jones on Sunday, Leonard completed 62.1% (18 of 29) of passes for 145 yards and an interception. He rushed twice for 5 yards and a touchdown.

Leonard is a Day 3 draft pick with a banged-up knee who is “learning this business and I don’t have an opinion on it,” he said diplomatically of the signing. But in a vacuum, it should be reasonable to ask: What can a 44-year-old even do against a frenetic Seahawks front featuring the likes of Leonard Williams and DeMarcus Lawrence? Does this guy really want to do this?

Advertisement

It turns out, Leonard has reason to know better: The 23-year-old worked out with the 44-year-old then-high school coach through the spring in their shared Alabama town of Fairhope.

So Leonard knows that Rivers knows the scheme because it was Rivers he texted when the Colts drafted him, and Rivers whose house he then drove to to review the Colts’ playbook together. Leonard knows Rivers can throw after the two battled in net target throws in the spring. And Leonard knows Rivers is as competitive as he’s seen because when they raced in sprints or throwing on the run, Leonard would hear about it hours later.

“If I got him that day in particular, he’d send me a voice memo at 11 p.m. at night complaining on how I cheated and how I picked an unfair drill,” Leonard said Wednesday. “So yeah, I knew he still had [the drive]. But it is crazy.

“It is as crazy to me as it is anybody.”

Rivers rejoins the Colts five years after his last action in a 17-year career. Rivers won 134 of 240 career regular-season games, completing 64.9% of passes for 63,440 yards, 421 touchdowns and 209 interceptions.

His last NFL action came with the Colts in 2020, after 16 years with the Chargers. Rivers completed 68% of pass attempts for 24 touchdowns and 11 interceptions as the Colts advanced to the playoffs.

He didn’t sit around hoping this opportunity would come again.

“Certainly I wasn’t really hanging onto any hope [of] playing again,” Rivers said. “I kind of thought that ship had sailed. But something about it excited me. And it’s kind of one of those deals that a door opens and you can either walk through it and find out if you can do it, or run from it.

Advertisement

“I know there’s risk involved obviously or what may or may not happen. But the only way to find out is going for it. And I felt almost like it was a gift and another opportunity to play and cut it loose with the guys in the game you love to play and the dream you got to live. You may get some bonus time. So I really kept it as simple as that in my mind. And here I stand.”

Do Colts have a chance to make noise with Rivers?

Playing shape and pocket movement will be the biggest questions for Rivers, even if mobility wasn’t the top trait on which his NFL success long hinged.

Mastering the game plan, by all accounts, does not seem to be a concern.

Not only did Rivers play in this system dating back to his Chargers tenure, including four years with Steichen as quarterbacks coach and then interim offensive coordinator — but also Rivers has coached his son Gunnar’s high school team this year with the same playbook. He and Steichen have reviewed concepts and how they were received throughout the season. The mental catchup, Steichen and Rivers feel, is doable.

“I told Gunnar last night, I gave him a play off the call sheet and he was like, ‘Dang, because we ran that play two weeks ago in the semifinal game,’” Rivers said. “You know what I mean? So that part's cool …

“It’s been a whirlwind of 48 hours, I’ll say. But each moment that goes by, I feel more and more confident.”

Will confidence be sufficient? Rivers is not the first player to return after a period of time away, even if the circumstances have varied. The Browns went to the playoffs during the 2023 season after signing Joe Flacco off the couch in December — but Flacco had spent 11 months away from the game, not 59. Some players have suffered injuries after sudden returns, including safety Eric Weddle tearing a pec in the 2021 season’s Super Bowl with the Los Angeles Rams and Darren Waller injuring his pec earlier this season (Waller has returned from injured reserve).

Rivers said he and his family are “a little scared, a little nervous.” But beyond the doubt, he believes football comes with injury risk at any age or stage. The Colts don’t need to look far to remember.

“You never hope something like that or expect something like that to happen,” Rivers said. “But shoot, something like that happens, I got a long time to recover, so that’s for sure.”

The Colts, meanwhile, feel time is ticking on the playoff window they demonstrated belief in after a trade-deadline acquisition of cornerback Sauce Gardner. Indianapolis doesn’t want to lose out on a wide-open AFC in a year when Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs are set to break their seven-year streak of not just playoff berths but AFC championship berths.

Any quarterback who can help Indianapolis chase that goal is welcome, beginning with contests against the top two scoring defenses in the Seahawks (17.4 points per game) and Houston Texans (16.0)

The Colts’ playoff hopes could hinge on Rivers’ ability.

After an 8-2 start that featured wins over current playoff contenders in the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Chargers, three straight losses have followed.

Losing to the Jaguars last week knocked the Colts out of the playoff picture, their 8-5 record now eighth place in the AFC and third in the AFC South beneath the 9-4 Jaguars and 8-5 Texans (the Texans beat the Colts, giving them the tiebreaker).

The Colts currently have a 26% chance to make the playoffs, per Next Gen Stats. If they beat the Seahawks this weekend, that chance jumps to 50%, per Next Gen Stat’s model.

With that upside, Rivers wants to make a bet on his health and is willing to renounce his 2026 Pro Hall of Fame semifinalist status, his candidacy consideration delayed another five years if he plays.

He can spend time doubting his ability. Or he could take a chance.

“The easiest way to eliminate all the things that can go bad is to stay home,” Rivers said. “And the only way to find out, ‘Can you still do it?’ is to go try.

“There’s something about being back in this building that feels right. And I’m just thankful.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JOEi7.70RAiGt3FORvHG0w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://d29szjachogqwa.cloudfront.net/images/2025-12/ee38b257-1951-4960-8ac0-fc9d46742268,N,,2025-12-11 18:02:59.780097

Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels, dragged to the grass by a Seattle Seahawks defender on a running play last month, tried to break his fall with his left hand but ended up bending his elbow in a manner it shouldn’t be bent. Writhing in pain, he lay on his back, grimacing.

Fans in the stadium were stunned, not knowing whether their star might be out for the foreseeable future.

Countless fantasy football team owners who had Daniels on their teams had their own concern: how much time he’d miss and how it would affect their seasons.

Pulling up social media, they turned to the likes of Jeff Mueller.

Mueller is among a growing number of medical professionals who have found an audience in NFL fans, fantasy football players and sports bettors, all of whom seek information about players’ availability before official announcements are made.

Within minutes after an athlete goes down, the doctors post across Instagram, X, YouTube and TikTok their projected injury diagnoses and how many games they envision the player to miss. Later, throughout the week, they give updates on the player's game availability. What they say may either calm nerves or lead to utter panic.

“That desire for injury information has increased over the years because fantasy football has grown with multiple avenues of playing with redraft, dynasty, best ball, guillotine and various other leagues,” Mueller said. “People crave instant information and intel on topics such as injuries because it can have a big impact on their own leagues, betting, odds and other possible impacts even though we often get factual information several days later.”

Mueller is a physical therapist with more than a decade of experience at a sports medicine clinic. His background — and that of seemingly every other medical professional analyzing sports injuries on social media today — has come into question when a diagnosis is made. Are they actually qualified to provide accurate calls without X-rays or examining players in person?

NBC News spoke with six medical professionals with roles from orthopedic surgeon to physical therapist.

Like all content creators, the doctors can monetize injury analysis by driving traffic to their platforms. The larger the following, the higher the chance of financial gain. Some have under 10,000 followers, while others are in the hundreds of thousands across platforms.

But all treat patients first and look at NFL injuries second.

“This is my side hustle. This isn’t my full-time job,” said Tom Christ, a physical therapist outside Philadelphia. “So if I’m in the clinic and we get some kind of [NFL] news breaking, there’s a good chance I’m not looking at my phone for three straight hours when I’m working.”

Christ estimates he spends 10 to 15 hours per week on content creation, not including watching games. He says his game setup is fairly bare-bones: He watches NFL RedZone and takes in as many replays as possible if a player goes down.

“When an injury happens, I’ll record it on my phone and then crop it so you don’t see my walls,” he joked.

Dr. Jesse Morse’s routine is a bit more nuanced. A physician in family and sports medicine who specializes in injuries and musculoskeletal pain, he runs a clinic in Florida that focuses on regenerative medicine. On an NFL Sunday, he also watches RedZone but has a team of two to five people “that will be spotters for me” and alert him of any injury. They then make sure he has video of all the angles and an updated injury history of the player to best assess the situation.

Morse, who spends roughly 20 to 30 hours per week during the season analyzing football injuries, says his background and expertise allow him to have a strong indication of what occurred and the timetable for a player to return “within probably 20 seconds.” His aim is to have a full breakdown online in 10 minutes.

He’s quick to point out that not all injuries are created equal and that factors like previous health situations could make a diagnosis more difficult. Severity is also crucial.

Take Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, for example, who was sidelined after he was tackled by a Jacksonville Jaguars defensive lineman in Week 2.

The video of how he got hurt wasn’t immediately clear, leading Morse to ponder a multitude of questions: “Was he walking [after getting hurt]? Was he in a scooter? Which foot was it? How did it happen? Was it a contact? Was it noncontact? Does he have an injury history of this specific injury or this area of the body? Then from there, you narrow it down to the different injuries you can have for that area.”

Initially, Morse wrote that it was a “left toe injury” that was a “turf toe vs. toe fracture vs. toe dislocation.” It ended up being the former. Morse then said he was “expecting Joe Burrow to miss at the minimum four weeks but [the injury could be] potentially season-ending.” After Burrow had surgery, Morse wrote that “there’s a small chance he’s able to return in December.”

Burrow got back on the field against the Baltimore Ravens on Nov. 27.

While fans crave instant information, the doctors say they aim to not rush out a diagnosis.

“You don’t want to just get out there as fast as possible and be wrong,” Christ said. “You want to be known for being accurate. So I would personally rather take my time and really evaluate the video and then put out my thoughts.’”

Dr. Nithin Natwa, a board-certified sports physician who now works at an urgent care facility in Chicago, said specific language is key. It’s best for professionals to never say a player has an exact injury or will be out a certain amount of time because they are ultimately giving their best guesses.

“It’s really important to be measured in the language that you use and just kind of say, ‘These are possible outcomes, and it seems like it’s more likely it’s this one, but without having imaging results or physical exam, it could definitely be one of these less severe cases.’ I try to give all the options out there.”

Though they work to be as precise as possible, some other medical professionals say they aren’t sure that the standard has been met.

Stephania Bell is considered a pioneer in the field. Bell, ESPN’s senior writer and injury analyst, joined ESPN in the fall of 2007 after more than 17 years as a physical therapist and orthopedic clinical specialist. At that time, very few (if any) medical professionals wrote or spoke on television about sports injuries.

She initially found inspiration from members of her fantasy league.

“The guys I played fantasy football with knew (I treated athletes) and were asking me questions all the time, and that’s how I started to realize that the information was probably marketable,” she said. “And I saw that fantasy football was growing.”

Today, she is considered one of the most trusted injury experts in sports media, co-hosting the popular “Fantasy Focus Football” podcast and making regular television appearances. The one place you won’t find her, however, is on social media giving instant prognostications about injuries.

Because she doesn’t have access to any imaging and isn’t examining a player in person, she prefers to wait until a team releases an official update or one of ESPN’s many “insiders” provides the latest.

Being right matters more to her than being first.

“The medical folks who are actually covering the teams don’t love it that people are ripping off these diagnoses,” she said. “They’re frustrated because they’re like, ‘I can tell you how much more goes into it with being there, and we still don’t always know.’ So I understand there’s an appetite for quick information, but for me, in my professional lifetime, that’s just not where I’m gonna live.”

Dr. Christopher Cooke took it a step further. Cooke, an orthopedic surgeon outside Detroit who was a team doctor with the Tigers and a consultant for the Red Wings, said fans must be skeptical about what they see online.

“There’s a lot of armchair doctor people out there who make comments,” he said. “Not to sound too boisterous, I don’t think the majority of them really know what’s going on.”

Cooke was in a five-year orthopedic surgery residency followed by a one-year sports medicine fellowship at Kerlan Jobe Medical Center in Los Angeles. It was there that ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction — or Tommy John surgery — was first conducted.

Cooke said experience is needed to be able to properly diagnose an injury. Otherwise, medical professionals are “at a disadvantage.”

“They don’t have the five years of studying the body. They don’t have the hands-on experience. They’ve never held an ACL in their hand as they reconstructed it. It’s someone who certainly could fit a role, but they’re not an expert in the area.”

“There’s only a finite amount of people I really trust what they say,” he said later. “And oftentimes these people online don’t have the training to make the right comments, but they have enough knowledge to just spout out something. Oftentimes, in my opinion, they’re very, very wrong.”

Though most take extra caution when they make diagnoses, specifically saying a certain injury or timetable is “possible” or “likely,” there are times when the medical professionals miss the mark.

After Arizona Cardinals running back Trey Benson injured a knee on Sept. 25, Natwa went on Instagram and said he should return in five to seven weeks. Instead, two months later, the team announced he wouldn’t be back at all this season.

Dr. Tarek Souryal is an orthopedic surgeon who was a longtime team doctor for the Dallas Mavericks. While he agreed with Cooke that some online doctors may not have the proper credentials — and urged fans to be wary of diagnoses off video alone — they are knowledgeable enough for what they are being asked to give out.

“If I was using purely the video to perform surgery on Kobe Bryant, that would be extraordinarily dangerous and frankly malpractice,” Souryal said. “However, if I’m looking at a video and I’m saying, ‘I think he ruptured his Achilles tendon, that’s what the video tape looks like it shows, and I wouldn’t count on him being back in the next four to six months,’ I don’t think there’s any harm in making that kind of speculation.”

Colts quarterback Daniel Jones was arguably the biggest surprise early on in the NFL season. Jones, once the longtime New York Giants signal-caller, led Indianapolis to an 8-2 start and drew early MVP buzz. But injuries in recent weeks led to a decline in his play, and things took a turn for the worse Sunday: He sustained a season-ending Achilles injury.

Shortly after the game, Natwa took to Instagram for a full video breakdown.

“We see him take a false step back,” he says, pointing to a slo-mo replay. “It’s where you start a step back and your ankle is put in an extreme acute angle, really loading the Achilles. As you’re pushing off, the Achilles has an increased risk of rupturing.”

Natwa said he doesn’t just want to give an injury label and a timetable. His goal is to educate with longer videos, even though it may take more work. He spends around 36 hours a week on football injury analysis.

It has led to some minor fame, though not in his own house.

“Some guy saw me in a coffee shop where we live, and he recognized me,” he said. “He was like, ‘Oh, man, you’re the fantasy doc.’ And [my wife was] like, ‘Oh, my God, is this that fantasy football thing that no one watches?’ And the guy at the coffee shop was like, ‘No, no. We all watch it. We watch his videos.’ She was so annoyed.”

Evan Jeffries, a physical therapist based in San Diego who breaks down injuries in all sports, not just football, has a bit more sympathy from his family.

“My kids think it’s funny. They love it,” he said. “They think I’m famous, and I tell them I’m definitely not famous.”

For Morse — who says he earns $25,000 to $50,000 per year on average analyzing football injuries — money isn’t why he does it.

“I’m a fantasy fan first, then I happen to be a doctor, and then I happen to be a specialist in sports medicine. I’m just crazy passionate about it. If you’re not, you don’t have the time to do this,” he said. “If you were to call up any random sports medicine doctor [or] orthopedic surgeon and say, ‘Hey, what happened to Jayden Daniels yesterday?’ There’s going to be like, ‘What the hell are you talking about?’”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/20251010NBCNewsfantasy-footballfinalv3-7fe1a5.png",N,,2025-12-11 18:03:03.585887

""If I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing this,"" Burrow told reporters Wednesday. ""I have been through a lot. If it's not fun, then what am I doing it for? That is the mindset I am trying to bring to the table.""

Burrow started the first two games of the season for Cincinnati, but suffered a toe injury in Week 2 that kept him out until he was able to make his return against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 13.

The Bengals own a 3-1 record with Burrow under center this year, but their playoff hopes are rapidly fading largely due to a 1-8 mark in the nine games he missed.

If Cincinnati is ultimately eliminated from postseason contention, it would mark the third consecutive year that the team misses the playoffs. The Bengals' recent struggles are especially disappointing given their Super Bowl appearance during the 2021 season and AFC Championship Game appearance the following year.

As for Burrow, the two-time Pro Bowler has still been effective despite his limited playing time this season. He's completed 59.3 percent of his throws for 734 yards and eight touchdowns compared to a pair of interceptions.

Still, 2025 marked the third season that Burrow suffered a significant injury in his NFL career.

Wilson, who started at left guard for 11 of the first 12 games, seemingly is on track to return for this Sunday’s home game against the Buffalo Bills.
