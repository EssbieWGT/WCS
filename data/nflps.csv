Two firsts for a corner always felt off, though. There are some positions for which two firsts will feel worth the risk, but I'm not convinced that corner will ever be one.

Obviously this view is coloured by personal bias, given the Parsons trade. Still though, the Sauce trade didn't feel worth it at the time to me.

Then, when you judge the trade by outcome rather than by process, it looks even worse. Your star corner misses the most crucial time of the season, your resurgent QB is going to be out for this season and beyond, you don't have a first round pick until 2028.

Pierce got up slowly after making an apparent touchdown catch, only to have the catch overturned. Trainers examined Pierce on the bench first, then in the team’s injury tent.

The television broadcast initially reported Pierce was being evaluated for a concussion, but Pierce was available for interviews after the game; NFL players are not allowed to speak to the media while in concussion protocol.

“You can ask the trainers,” Pierce said. “Not going to talk about injuries.”

Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen did not have an update on Pierce after the game.

Asked a follow-up question about how he felt, Pierce kept it short and sweet.

“Feel good,” Pierce said.

Pierce is having an excellent season in the final year of his rookie deal. He had five catches for 80 yards on Sunday, bringing his season totals to 38 catches and a team-leading 769 yards while teaming well with quarterback Daniel Jones, who suffered an Achilles injury on Sunday that the Colts fear will knock him out the rest of the season.

“I really still haven’t processed it yet,” Pierce said. “I still need to go talk to him and stuff. Feel terrible for him. You never want to see that happen.

The Colts had been having internal discussions about a contract extension for Jones long before they became the hottest offense in the NFL.
But things were already slipping away even before Jones' injury.","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Daniel Jones limped off the field and into the tunnel leading to the locker room of dejected Indianapolis Colts. He was rain-soaked, disheveled and had just sustained a right torn Achilles a couple hours prior. The expression he wore after Sunday's 36-16 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars was the perfect illustration of his team's bleak predicament.

The Colts (8-5), already in the midst of a precipitous slide after starting the season with the NFL's best record at 7-1, now face a long list of complicated questions in the wake of Jones' serious injury. A torn Achilles, which is what a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter Jones suffered, can take as long as a year to fully recover from, raising thorny issues related to the future of the position in Indianapolis. And given the unraveling of the Colts' season, what might a disappointing finish mean for the team's leadership, its veteran players and everyone involved?

With Jones headed for season-ending surgery and months of rehab, here are the critical questions brought about by Jones' devastating injury.

What happens in the immediate term?

For now, rookie backup Riley Leonard takes the reins, and that puts the Colts in a tough spot. Leonard was drafted in the sixth round out of Notre Dame with the team viewing him as a developmental quarterback. He was the third-string option until a scary pregame accident involving quarterback Anthony Richardson Sr., who sustained an orbital fracture to his face after a mishap involving stretching bands in October. Richardson remains on injured reserve.

Leonard has been the No. 2 quarterback ever since. And while he has worked diligently and has made significant strides -- just last week Leonard spent a late evening at Jones' house doing extra game prep -- one of the primary strengths of the Colts' offense was Jones' ability to process situations quickly and accurately and make sound decisions. Leonard will be hard-pressed to duplicate that given his inexperience.

Against the Jags, Leonard completed 18 of 29 attempts for 145 yards with no touchdowns and one interception. Leonard also rushed for a score. But 16 of Leonard's attempts were five yards or fewer down the field, according to ESPN Research.

Leonard did show the game wasn't too big for him, and he'll need to demonstrate that again if he makes his first start next Sunday at the Seattle Seahawks. In the immediate aftermath of the game, Leonard was already getting significant support from his teammates.

""Having guys like [All-pro guard] Quenton Nelson come up to me and say he believes in me,"" Leonard said, ""Everybody on the sideline was so supportive. That's always good for a rookie quarterback.""

What's next at quarterback for Indy?

The Colts had been having internal discussions about a contract extension for Jones long before they became the hottest offense in the NFL. Through eight games, the Colts were averaging six more points than any other team and were producing 6.5 yards per play, on pace for one of the highest marks in franchise history.

Jones was the key to unlocking all of it, with his efficiency, accurate passing and execution of coach Shane Steichen's smart schemes. Jones seemed like an answer to the Colts' yearslong uncertainty at quarterback. But now, everything about his future is in question.

He is scheduled to become a free agent in the spring, when his one-year contract expires. But he will be far from a return to the field at that point, and his status for next season is, at best, in question.

Do the Colts take a chance and sign him to a reduced contract? Do they look elsewhere? Can they even count on him for 2026?

Those answers are a long way off, but the impression Jones has made on the Colts was clear in the reaction to his injury.

""That's our team leader,"" receiver Alec Pierce said. ""That's our team captain right there. Everything runs through him. That was brutal.""

Worth noting is that Richardson remains under contract for 2026. His future has been in question since he lost a preseason position battle with Jones. But Sunday's developments could change things for him. Richardson showed improvement through training camp and is still just 23 years old.

What if the season unravels?

In many ways, it is already unraveling. The Colts started Sunday in a tie for first place in the AFC South, but Jacksonville (9-4) now sits alone atop the division. The Colts dropped to the periphery of the wild-card standings after the loss.

So, after a remarkable start that had Indianapolis with the best record in the NFL, how will a collapse down the stretch reflect on the men in charge of the team?

The futures of general manager Chris Ballard and Steichen were in question after last season's 8-9 finish. But the late owner Jim Irsay, who passed away in May, agreed to give the pair one more shot in 2025.

Losing a starting quarterback in Week 14 with the playoffs still within reach certainly complicates the evaluation process. But things were already slipping away even before Jones' injury. Nothing that's happened in recent weeks reflects well on the team's brass, and it will be a difficult assessment if the Colts can't finish strong in its remaining games against the Seahawks, Jaguars, San Francisco 49ers and Houston Texans. The combined record of those teams is 39-14.

What is the impact of ownership changes?

The subplot to all of this is that all the difficult decisions ahead of the Colts will be made by different decision-makers.

Irsay's oldest daughter, Carlie Irsay-Gordon, and her sisters, Casey Foyt and Kalen Jackson, are now primary owners. How they will process what's happened isn't certain. Jim Irsay was often prone to emotional and abrupt decisions, but his daughters are seen as much more pragmatic.

However they choose to proceed, the Colts are not in an optimum situation. Jones' injury is compounded by the absence of their first-round picks in 2026 and 2027, which the team recently traded to the New York Jets for cornerback Sauce Gardner in an effort to make a deep playoff run this season.

The Colts also will have to navigate the futures of core players. Pierce and defensive end Kwity Paye are entering free agency, receiver Michael Pittman Jr.'s salary-cap figure jumps to $29 million and running back Jonathan Taylor is due an extension (2026 is the final season of his contract).

A single injury has led to a multitude of questions for which there are no immediate answers.",https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2025%2F1208%2Fr1586561_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg,N,,2025-12-08 02:58:56.809449

Earlier this week, they put first-round draft pick and starting left tackle Josh Simmons went on injured reserve following surgery to repair a fractured and dislocated wrist.

(AP) — The injury-riddled Kansas City Chiefs lost left tackle Wanya Morris to a left knee injury on the first play against the Houston Texans on Sunday night, leaving their makeshift offensive line with three backups and rookie Esa Pole protecting Patrick Mahomes’ blind side.

Not exactly an ideal situation against Danielle Hunter, Will Anderson Jr. and one of the best pass rushes in the NFL.

The patchwork bunch managed to turn in a respectable effort against Houston, but the Chiefs offense nevertheless struggled to get anything going against the league’s top-ranked defense. Patrick Mahomes threw three interceptions, the Chiefs were stopped twice on fourth down in the fourth quarter, and Houston walked away with a 20-10 victory inside Arrowhead Stadium.

“I was proud of the guys for the effort they put in,” Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. “These guys take responsibility for things. You know, you keep going. But we put everything into these games, every game, so when you lose, you should be upset. And that’s why you try to enjoy the wins when you have an opportunity. There is a lot of time and effort that goes into it.”

The Chiefs also lost former All-Pro cornerback Trent McDuffie to a knee injury in the first quarter, when he jumped high to try to knock a pass away from Nico Collins. Not only did McDuffie get hurt, the big wide receiver hauled in the 46-yard reception.

But it was on offense where the injuries really hurt the Chiefs.

Earlier this week, they put first-round draft pick and starting left tackle Josh Simmons went on injured reserve following surgery to repair a fractured and dislocated wrist. Then, right tackle Jawaan Taylor was ruled out with a triceps injury and standout right guard Trey Smith with an ankle injury, making it three starters out even before kickoff.

The Chiefs opted to put primary backup Jaylon Moore at right tackle and Morris on the left side, with Mike Caliendo getting the start in Smith’s place. So when Morris went down, the Chiefs had to count on Pole — their de factor fourth-string offensive tackle.

Pole played two seasons at a California junior college and two at Washington State. He went undrafted in April and signed with the Chiefs the following month. He also had a stint with the Jets before returning to Kansas City in late October.

“I mean, you just got next man up,” said Mahomes, who finished with just 160 yards passing and the three picks. “Obviously not where you want to be, but Esa played his tail off, for a guy that had to get activated and be on the roster and go against one of the best pass rushes in the league. He gave me time to throw the ball downfield in some big situations.”

The Chiefs just didn’t connect on enough of them. Or make enough plays when they mattered the most.

“We’ve been close all season. At the end of the day, you have to go out there and make it happen,” Mahomes said. “We’ve got the talent. We got the heart. But we have to go out there and execute. And until we prove it, we’re going to come out with losses.”

This is the first report that confirms that Jones suffered an Achilles tear, but this was the fear.

Jones suffered a non-contact injury in the first quarter of Sunday's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars when attempting to throw a pass.

He was ruled out with an Achilles injury.

""It's not looking good,"" Shane Steichen said after the game.

With Jones out against the Jacksonville Jaguars, rookie Riley Leonard took over at quarterback.

Leonard was 18-for-29 passing for 245 yards with an interception after Jones exited the game.

The Colts also have Brett Rypien on the practice squad at quarterback while Anthony Richardson remains on injured reserve.

Steichen provided a recent update on Richardson but did not have a timeline for his potential return.

After Sunday's loss, the Colts are now 8-5 and trail the 9-4 Jaguars in the AFC South. They finish the year with one of the toughest schedules in football, with all four of their remaining opponents over the .500 mark.

The same ailment led cornerback Trent McDuffie to leave in the first quarter, and he too was later ruled out.

Morris, starting in place of the injured Josh Simmons, suffered the injury when he appeared to be rolled up on by center Creed Humphrey while run blocking.

Within minutes of having to be assisted off the field, Morris was put onto the back of a cart and taken to the locker room. He was downgraded to out before the end of the first quarter and was replaced by undrafted rookie Esa Pole, who made his NFL debut after being elevated to the active roster this past week.

The Washington Commanders tight end suffered a knee injury against the Minnesota Vikings Dec. 7 and did not return.

Commanders quarterback Marcus Mariota – in for the injured starter Jayden Daniels – threw high to Ertz in the third quarter. Vikings safety Jay Ward came in low and plowed into Ertz’s vulnerable right leg.

After the hit, Ertz immediately signaled to the Washington sideline for assistance and, unable to put any weight on the leg, he was carried off the field.

Mariota consoled Ertz while the latter was on the cart, and the broadcast cameras showed a distressed Daniels – who, despite the 10-year age gap, has developed a strong kinship with the veteran presence that was key to turning around the losing ways during Dan Quinn’s first season in 2024.

Ertz played in all of the Commanders’ games last season and had seven touchdowns. In 2025, he was up to 50 catches and four touchdowns.

Reminds me of when Zack Martin was talking in an interview where apparently Jerry Jones was pissed with the line injuries that he forced them all to wear braces

Played football, but never good enough to the level where the team supplies the whole OL with legit knee braces lol. But I believe the main reason they wear them is because the likelihood of getting rolled up from any direction (mostly from behind or the sides) is so high battling in the trenches

During an address last week at Forbes’ annual Healthcare Summit, NFL Chief Medical Officer Allen Sills noted that all 32 of the league’s teams report to the same EHR.

“It’s things on our game day — medical reports from all of our 30 medical providers that are at every NFL game.
In his eyes, this comprehensive dataset allows the NFL to study injury mechanisms more rigorously than any other sports league.","Healthcare providers have struggled with data interoperability since the advent of the EHR decades ago, failing to fully connect patient information across systems. They may have an unlikely model to look to for improvement: the National Football League.

During an address last week at Forbes’ annual Healthcare Summit, NFL Chief Medical Officer Allen Sills noted that all 32 of the league’s teams report to the same EHR. Having all this player data in one place helps the league not only treat injuries more effectively but also prevent them, he said.

“If we think about all the injuries that happen in an athletic competition, yes, some of them are maybe bad luck. Players accidentally collide, they accidentally hit the ground. But there is a proportion of them — and we might disagree about the proportion — that I would call preventable. They’re preventable if we understand the drivers — if we understand the who, what, why and the circumstances of those injuries,” Sills explained.

The NFL shares its players’ health data with a third party epidemiology data science company, which delivers insights that help the league better understand the drivers of injury, he stated.

It doesn’t just share EHR data, he pointed out.

“It’s things on our game day — medical reports from all of our 30 medical providers that are at every NFL game. It’s equipment tracking. We tag all the helmets, cleats and shoulder pads that players wear. Every player wears a GPS tracking device so we know how fast, how far, where they’re moving, what the spatial relationships are on the field. We have surface data, we have environmental data, we have participation, and we have video,” Sills declared.

In his eyes, this comprehensive dataset allows the NFL to study injury mechanisms more rigorously than any other sports league.

In this day and age, injury-prevention efforts are quite multifaceted, he added. They typically require input from various experts, including nutritionists, behavioral health specialists, sport scientists, strength and conditioning coaches, performance staff and equipment managers.

For instance, equipment staff has been essential in developing concussion prevention programs through helmet testing and engineering, Sills said. The NFL has reconstructed more than 1,500 concussions using video and engineering models, mapping over 150 variables for each event. This has led to testing systems that rank helmet models based on injury risk.

The league has also rolled out education campaigns to shift players toward safer helmet choices — and now 98% of players wear only the high-safety models, Sills noted.

American football has long been criticized as a dangerous and injury-prone sport, but he believes it is well within the NFL’s ability to make the game both safer and more engaging. Sills thinks that data interoperability will continue to play a major role in this as the league continues to innovate its rules, equipment and protocols.

This isn't the way one of the NFL's best stories this season was supposed to end. Jones, who went from being cut during the 2024 season by the lowly New York Giants to a fantastic reclamation story with the Indianapolis Colts, took a seat after suffering an Achilles injury. His reaction was telling. He knew all of the implications immediately. The Colts probably did too.

Indianapolis wasn't very competitive in Sunday's 36-19 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars after Jones' injury, and that's not surprising. The Colts, now 8-5, fell behind the 9-4 Jaguars for the AFC South lead. Losing ground in the division is just the start of their problems. Colts head coach Steve Steichen wouldn't confirm Jones' injury is season-ending but said ""it doesn't look good,"" via Stephen Holder of ESPN. On Sunday evening, ESPN reported that Jones' injury was season-ending, and he will undergo surgery.

The injury is devastating on many levels. The Colts started the season 7-1, then lost three of four but were still in decent shape to at least make the playoffs. That isn't the case anymore. The Colts already lost Anthony Richardson to a weird orbital bone fracture in a pregame mishap, and they're down to sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard, who didn't have an NFL completion before Sunday.

It's a massive injury for Jones' career, the 2026 free-agency market and the short-term plans of the Colts. Jones is on a one-year deal. He had positioned himself to sign another big extension, or at least get the franchise tag for a huge payday. He played through a fracture in his fibula with the Colts leading the division, which was commendable due to the risk involved. An Achilles injury can take up to a full year to return from; Jones injuring it late in the season doesn't help the uncertainty with his free agency.

There was little doubt that Jones was going to be back with Indianapolis, whether on a long-term deal or the franchise tag. That's a reason the Colts traded two first-round draft picks to the New York Jets for cornerback Sauce Gardner. They felt they had an answer at quarterback and didn't need to worry about potentially drafting one. That all changed on one play Sunday.

The Jets also are affected by Jones' injury, considering that next year's first-round pick from Indianapolis is likely to become much more valuable.

Other teams are affected, too. The AFC South race changes dramatically and looks like a two-team race between the Jaguars and Texans the rest of the way. Unless Leonard is a rare rookie success story, the Colts are unlikely to even make the playoffs. That would open up a wild-card spot, perhaps for someone on the bubble like the Chiefs. It would be a story for the ages if Jones' injury set off a chain reaction that allowed the Chiefs to get in the playoffs when they normally wouldn't have.

Jones' status for the the 2026 season will be a big question heading into the offseason, and will affect his future for next season and beyond. There are other questions, like whether head coach Shane Steichen might be in trouble if the Colts go from 7-1 to out of the playoffs, though it would seem like he'd get the benefit of the doubt after losing his quarterback.

Jones had been writing a tremendous story through the first half of the season. He had been ridiculed as a bust and given up on by the Giants. Then he took advantage of a chance to win the Colts' starting quarterback job and through the first half of the season was on a remarkable run. One of the NFL's best stories turned into one of the more awful ones with one misstep.

Here are the rest of the winners and losers from Week 14 of the NFL season:

Advertisement

WINNERS

Green Bay Packers: The Packers still have Super Bowl dreams, but the path becomes a lot harder if they don’t win the NFC North.

The Packers took a big step toward that division championship on Sunday with a 28-21 win over the Chicago Bears. The Bears got aggressive on a fourth-and-1 play call inside the Packers’ 20-yard line in the final minute, faking a handoff and rolling quarterback Caleb Williams to his left. Packers corner Keisean Nixon had played it perfectly and picked off Williams’ pass to the end zone to seal the win.

The Packers played well against a game Bears team. Jordan Love threw for three touchdowns. Josh Jacobs ran for 86 yards and a touchdown. The Packers kept Williams to less than 200 yards passing. There’s a rematch in Chicago in a couple of weeks, and the Packers’ win Sunday gives them a chance to perhaps put away the Bears in the division race when the teams meet again.

Puka Nacua: It’s rare to see a receiver leave a cornerback in the dust off the line of scrimmage and then also Moss him for a touchdown on the same play. But Nacua is a unique player.

Advertisement

The highlight of a monster day from Nacua in the Los Angeles Rams’ 45-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals came in the third quarter. Nacua had a great move to burn the cornerback covering him, but Matthew Stafford underthrew him. No problem, as Nacua adjusted and caught it over the corner for a 31-yard touchdown.

Nacua finished with seven catches for 167 yards and two touchdowns. Nacua has had a fantastic season and the Rams bounced back quickly from a loss last week to the Panthers. The Seahawks won too, continuing to build momentum for a titanic Week 16 matchups between the two NFC West powers.

Mike Tomlin and Aaron Rodgers: A week after Pittsburgh Steelers fans were chanting for Tomlin to be fired and Rodgers found himself dealing with blood trickling down his nose after he was blasted on a hit from behind, both of them found redemption.

Advertisement

Rodgers had a throwback game and Tomlin got a win closer to extending his streak of never have a record under .500 with a huge 27-22 win at the Baltimore Ravens. Baltimore had its chances.

The Ravens had a touchdown to Isaiah Likely overturned because it was knocked out of his hands in the end zone before he completed the catch, and a last-minute drive ran out of time with the Ravens in Steelers territory. Lamar Jackson was sacked as he tried to get off a Hail Mary pass and time expired. The Ravens' miserable season continues, and now they're a game behind the Steelers in the AFC North standings.

Sunday might be remembered as Rodgers' best game in Pittsburgh. He had his first rushing touchdown since 2021 — complete with dusting off the old championship belt celebration — becoming the third 42-year-old player in NFL history to score a rushing touchdown (Tom Brady and Doug Flutie are the others). Rodgers also had some fantastic throws, and finished with 284 passing yards and a passing touchdown.

The win, coupled with the Bengals' loss, gets the Steelers much closer to a division championship. That might quiet the critics, at least temporarily.

Advertisement

Seahawks' claim as NFL's best team: Not that the Atlanta Falcons are much of an obstacle these days, but Seattle made sure it was never in danger of losing Sunday.

The Seahawks got an easy 37-9 win over the Falcons, who have to be questioning if head coach Raheem Morris will return for another season. Jaxon Smith-Njigba bounced back from a rare quiet day with two touchdowns. Seattle's defense was fantastic. The special teams got involved too, with Rashid Shaheed returning a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown.

In this season without a dominant team, the Seahawks are as good of a pick as any as the best in the NFL. At very least, they kept the pressure on the Los Angeles Rams for the NFC West crown and likely top seed in the conference.

Advertisement

Christian Benford and Bills' defense: Buffalo was in trouble in the fourth quarter. The Bills fell behind early to the Cincinnati Bengals and it looked for most of the game like they'd take a bad loss at home.

Cornerback Christian Benford made a play that might have saved their season. On a cornerback blitz, Benford made a spectacular interception of a Joe Burrow pass. Benford returned it 63 yards for a touchdown, part of a flurry of 21 points in 4:30 for the Bills that helped them save a 39-34 win over the Bengals.

After Benford's big play, the Bills got another interception and turned that into a touchdown pass from Josh Allen to Jackson Hawes on a fourth down. It was part of Allen's big day with three passing touchdowns and another rushing.

Advertisement

The Bills are still unlikely to win the AFC East, but a wild-card spot might have been in jeopardy with a loss to the Bengals. The Bills' defense — and Allen — made sure they didn't take that damaging loss Sunday.

LOSERS

Geno Smith: Finally, Smith broke.

Playing behind the worst offensive line in the NFL has to take a toll on Smith. He had been sacked 46 times in 12 games before Sunday and hit way more often than that. It’s impressive he has stayed in the lineup with the amount of punishment he has taken.

Smith was sacked another three times Sunday against the Denver Broncos before he left the game at the end of the third quarter. Earlier in the game he had hurt his right hand but stayed in the contest. It didn’t matter that he missed the fourth quarter; the Broncos cruised to a 24-17 win in a game that was never that close (and a horrible beat for those who had Broncos as 7.5-point favorites). Denver improved to 11-2, tied for the top record in the AFC.

Advertisement

The Raiders are having a miserable season and Smith hasn’t been able to do much to save it. Las Vegas made the questionable decision to trade for the 35-year-old Smith in the offseason, even though they were not close to contending. They don’t have a good enough infrastructure around Smith to help him. Raiders fans are turning on Smith as the terrible season drags on. Smith has taken a beating, literally and metaphorically.

Shedeur Sanders haters: It's not a good week to be in the anti-Sanders crowd.

The Tennessee Titans are a bad football team, but that doesn't take away from what Sanders did Sunday. Sanders had 364 yards, three touchdowns passing and another one rushing. His final passing touchdown came with 1:03 to go, but an ill-conceived 2-point conversion failed and the Titans held on for their second win of the season, 31-29.

It's hard to blame Sanders for the loss. He was very good, including the final drive when the Browns needed a touchdown to have a shot at the tie.

Sanders had a big fall in the NFL Draft, and he has been the most talked-about fifth-round rookie pick ever. He draws extreme opinions, pro and con, and each of his starts is dissected unlike any other quarterback who started the preseason fourth on the team's depth chart. Sanders has looked good through his three starts and was fantastic Sunday. It's hard to argue with the results.

Tampa Bay Buccaneers: The Buccaneers had a clear path to perhaps win out, and easily win the NFC South. It's not so clear anymore.

The Buccaneers made things harder on themselves by falling 24-20 to the New Orleans Saints at home. They're now tied with the Carolina Panthers at 7-6 for first place in the NFC South. The Saints were 2-10 coming into Sunday's game. It was a miserable loss for Tampa Bay.

The problem Sunday was Tampa's offense. Baker Mayfield had his second straight quiet day since suffering a left shoulder injury, throwing for only 122 yards. The Saints did a good job limiting the Bucs' big plays, and when the Bucs needed a touchdown late in the game to take the lead, they went four-and-out. On fourth down Cade Otton was shopped just short of the first down on a catch and that was it for Tampa Bay's chances.

Advertisement

The Buccaneers still have two games left against the Panthers, and those should determine the division champion. If Tampa Bay comes up a game short of the playoffs, the Bucs will know which game cost them.

Jayden Daniels: Daniels had one of the greatest rookie seasons in NFL history. It was arguably the best for a rookie quarterback ever.

His second season has been a nightmare. He has sustained multiple injuries, including a dislocated left elbow that seemed like it might knock him out for the rest of the season. Daniels was able to return, but maybe the Washington Commanders should have let him sit.

Nothing good is happening for Daniels this season, and he hurt his elbow again in a 31-0 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, who had a nice bounceback from J.J. McCarthy with three touchdown passes. Daniels was replaced by Marcus Mariota. Daniels wasn't that effective before the injury, completing just 9 of 20 passes for 78 yards and an interception. Washington didn't have a point on the board when he was knocked out of the game. Injuries have been a big part of Daniels' season, but he hasn't been nearly as effective when he has been on the field.

Advertisement

It's a lost season for Daniels. The best hope for Washington is that he gets to the offseason without anything else bad happening to him.

The Jets' QB room: It has been a bad year to be a Jets quarterback.

Justin Fields was ineffective and benched, and he was inactive Sunday due to a knee injury. He wasn't available when Tyrod Taylor suffered a groin injury and left the game. Taylor's final line was 1-of-4 passing for 6 yards and an interception, which was a passer rating of 8.7.

With Fields out, Brady Cook came in for his first NFL action. He had 163 yards, two interceptions and no touchdown passes. Any Jets fan who sat through an ugly 34-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins should ask for a refund.

It has been an ugly season overall for the Jets. They have to be hoping for it all to end soon, and then figure out the quarterback position in the offseason.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LXiZF4inVrGTgNIdsnWweA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/fd560620-d3b5-11f0-91b7-c96d15be7946,N,,2025-12-07 22:58:27.453632

""It doesn't look good,"" Steichen said via ESPN.

Jones, 28, suffered the injury on a non-contact play while dropping back to pass late in the first quarter, appearing to lose his footing while throwing the football. The veteran quarterback fell to the wet turf and was seen growing his right lower leg, showing visible frustration by slamming his helmet multiple times before being helped to his feet and walked off the field.

Jones was already dealing with a fibula fracture -- believed to be a hairline fracture -- that he played through during the last two games, which limited his mobility in consecutive losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans. The former first-round pick was replaced by rookie Riley Leonard, who played meaningful snaps for the first time in his NFL career, with former No. 4 overall pick Anthony Richardson Sr. on injury reserve due to a facial injury.

The loss on the field, with quarterback Daniel Jones sustaining an Achilles injury feared to be season-ending, could be much worse.

""It hurts. It's a dagger,"" Colts cornerback Kenny Moore said at his locker after a 36-19 defeat.

""That was definitely a gut punch,"" said running back Jonathan Taylor, whose team has lost four of five after a 7-1 start. ""We've got to catch ourselves. You've got to find some way, somehow, to catch yourself. You're going into a free-fall, whatever it takes, individually and collectively, to put your foot down ... to say we're not going to continue to let this snowball.""

Only one NFL team in the past 25 years has opened 7-1 and missed the playoffs, but there's a real danger of that if Jones is lost as expected and the Colts need to rally around rookie Riley Leonard, the team's No. 3 quarterback. Leonard, who had thrown two NFL passes before Sunday, had 145 passing yards and a rushing touchdown in his first real NFL action.

""The biggest thing today for me was to walk off to the sidelines and have guys like [Colts guard] Quenton Nelson come up to me and say he believes in me,"" said Leonard, a sixth-round pick from Notre Dame. ""Everybody on the sideline was just very supportive. ... I still say they believe in me, so I take that and run with it.""

Two months into the season, Jones was the surprise star in the Colts' unexpected success, with 13 touchdowns against two interceptions in their 7-1 start. Indianapolis had survived the struggles of Anthony Richardson, the No. 4 overall pick in 2023, pivoting to Jones on a one-year, $14 million contract. At the trade deadline, they went all-in, sending their next two first-round picks to the Jets for corner Sauce Gardner, who missed Sunday's game with a calf injury.

Richardson is on injured reserve with an eye injury and there's no timetable for his return, so instead of Jones, the Colts must try to collect themselves and rally around a rookie quarterback. Their final four opponents — the Seahawks, 49ers, Jaguars and Texans — represent a daunting stretch. All four teams have records as good as or better than the Colts', and all are vying for playoff positioning.

So what does coach Shane Steichen tell his players about bouncing back and having to play well in the final four games?

""Dang right we do,"" Steichen said on the podium after the loss. ""We've got to get this one cleaned up, and it's all about the next one. Shoot, we've got everything we want in front of us, you know? We've got to get this thing cleaned up and get ready for Seattle. We've got a big one on the road. That's the message right there.""

The Colts' problems had started long before Jones went down Sunday. Their lone win in the past four games was an overtime escape against the Falcons in Berlin, with one-score losses to the Steelers, Chiefs and Texans. They didn't start well against Jacksonville, giving up touchdowns on back-to-back drives for a 14-7 deficit before Jones went down with a non-contact injury. The Colts' defense gave up two more touchdowns by halftime, trailing 28-10 on the way to giving up a season-high 36 points.

""We've got to rally and be a brotherhood,"" Moore said. ""We've got to execute the things that we're talking about.""

Steichen was an NFL Coach of the Year candidate in the first half of the season, and now he's tasked with avoiding a nearly unprecedented collapse. Since the year 2000, the only team to start 7-1 and miss the playoffs was the 2012 Bears, who still managed to finish 10-6 and lose out on a tiebreaker. The Colts would need two wins to match that total, and there aren't any easy wins left on the schedule.

The Colts had a 68% chance of making the playoffs according to The Athletic's playoff simulator before Sunday's game, and the loss drops them to an even 50%, though it doesn't feel as easy as a coin flip. Two of those final four games are rematches of their last two divisional losses to the Texans and Jaguars. A 2-2 finish would likely get them in the playoffs, but to do that with a rookie quarterback and a team that's lost three straight and four out of five won't be easy.

""As you go through a season, you're going to go through some storms and some adversity,"" Steichen said. ""You've got to overcome those, and that's part of being a professional athlete and a coach, staying steady through that process, to keep believing and fighting like crazy. So that's what we're going to do. We're going to fight like crazy and believe, and we know that we've got a big one coming up on the road.""

Outside of that matchup, Buffalo handled the Bengals in a key AFC contest, while the Steelers took back control of the AFC North with a win over Baltimore. There were also a number of upsets, namely the Titans notching their second win of the year on the road in Cleveland and the Saints heading into Tampa and defeating the Bucs.

It was your standard mayhem that unfolded in the NFL on Sunday, and of course, there will be plenty of takeaways from the slate. But which are concrete and which are baseless? Below, we'll determine just that by examining some of the top storylines from Week 14 and figure out which we need to take seriously and which we can cast aside as overreactions.

Colts season is over after Daniel Jones' Achilles injury

Overreactions or reality: Reality

The Colts are in a bad way. They are now 8-5 on the season, falling further behind the Jaguars in the division after a 36-19 loss in Jacksonville.

Beyond losing ground in the AFC South, Indy now may need to go the rest of the season without Daniel Jones. The veteran quarterback suffered an Achilles injury during the contest, and it doesn't look promising as he was in noticeable pain following the non-contact injury. If he's done for the year, the injury could bring the Colts down with it.

Indianapolis had rookie Riley Leonard as the backup quarterback on Sunday, and it'd be a tall task to ask him to win out down the stretch against teams like the Seahawks (Week 15), 49ers (Week 16), Jaguars (Week 17), and Texans (Week 18). The Colts are now at legitimate risk of falling out of the playoffs entirely. Even if they squeak in, they won't make much noise.

J.J. McCarthy reestablished himself as Vikings franchise QB

Overreactions or reality: Overreaction

McCarthy was lights out in Sunday's 31-0 win over the Commanders. The second-year quarterback completed 16 of his 23 throws for 163 yards and three touchdowns.

Naturally, some will look at this as McCarthy planting his flag against anyone who feared he may not be Minnesota's franchise quarterback. While it was an encouraging step for McCarthy, we're not ready to go so far as to say he's fully reestablished himself as the Vikings' cornerstone under center.

Washington's defense is among the worst in the NFL, so McCarthy wasn't facing the toughest resistance when he dropped back to pass. If he starts to stack outings like this together over the final four games, it'll calm the nerves of many around the franchise.

Bengals' fourth-quarter collapse dashes playoff hopes

Overreactions or reality: Reality

After falling to the Bills on Sunday, Cincinnati is 4-9 on the season and very much on the outside looking in at the playoffs.

This defeat was a heartbreaker for the Bengals, who held a 28-18 lead in the fourth quarter. However, back-to-back interceptions by Joe Burrow (including a pick-six) gave Buffalo the lead and paved the way to a win.

This loss now puts the Bengals three games behind the Steelers for first place in the AFC North, and they are even further behind in the wild-card race. Losing to Buffalo also gives the Bills the head-to-head tiebreaker, so while Cincinnati is not officially eliminated from the playoffs at this moment, they may as well be.

Saints should build around Tyler Shough going forward

Overreactions or reality: Overreaction

Tyler Shough led the Saints to one of the biggest upsets of the season after New Orleans went into Raymond James Stadium and took down the Buccaneers, 24-20.

The rookie quarterback completed 13 of his 20 passes for 144 yards and an interception, but did the bulk of his damage on the ground. Shough rushed seven times for 55 yards and two touchdowns in the win.

This is yet another strong showing from Shough, who is trying to play well enough that the Saints decide to build around him going forward instead of dipping their toes back into the NFL Draft this spring.

While Shough is doing his best to change that, I don't think we're there yet. The Saints should continue to evaluate their young quarterback over this final stretch, but also leave the door open to take a quarterback in the first round of the 2026 NFL Draft if one falls to them.

Ravens are going to miss the playoffs

Overreactions or reality: Reality

Baltimore was unable to hold serve at home against the Steelers, falling to its division rival 27-22. The loss now puts Pittsburgh back atop the AFC North and drops the Ravens out of the playoff picture entirely.

While these two teams still have one more matchup in Week 18, Baltimore is at real risk of missing the postseason despite their previous surge back into the conversation. The club has now lost two in a row and has a daunting final four games: at Bengals (Week 15), vs. Patriots (Week 16), at Packers (Week 17), and at Steelers (Week 18).",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/07/dbb76903-c92b-40f6-a16e-47e863c6e4a0/thumbnail/1200x675/a49bf35c2a5632b13e18fbc44032de2b/daniel-jones-imagn.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 19:02:50.296020

He proved it even more on Sunday, during the Colts' game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, making the conscious effort to rejoin his teammates on the sidelines after leaving the game with an Achilles injury.

Jones sustained the injury late in the first quarter of the 36-19 loss, falling to the ground after throwing a pass and clutching his right lower leg (his left leg has the injured fibula). He tried to get up and walk to the sideline, but sat down grimacing as trainers rushed out.

""Daniel's the toughest guy that I've ever been around by far in my life,"" rookie quarterback Riley Leonard, who replaced Jones behind center, said after the game. ""He's the most competitive person that I've ever met. So it's no surprise that he came back out there and cheered us on, and I remember going over to the sidelines and he was the first one to put the raincoat on me, first one to ask me what I see on that play and help me out and what to expect in certain situations. So it's just exactly who he is, whether he's playing or not. He's very consistent, win or loss, so I really respect that about him.""

""Any time he can be out there — again, that's just him being a great teammate,"" Steichen said. ""He has a huge injury. Some guys will sit in the locker room, he wants to be out there with his guys, and he went out there and showed support for Riley and the rest of the guys.

""I mean, the guy is as top notch as it gets. One of the best I've ever been around in a quarterback room — just his mentality, the way he goes about his business, the way he works, the way he treats people. Just phenomenal. Phenomenal.""

""He's our brother,"" offensive tackle Bernhard Raimann said. ""He's giving it all for us, and we do the same for him. That's the kind of brotherhood you want and need in the locker room. And obviously we're praying for his quick recovery. But yeah, I would do anything for the guy. He's our quarterback. But Riley stepped in too, and he's a great guy too. He's been learning, he's been studying and we'll do whatever needs to be done to focus on the next games and win the next games.""

""Just gotta find a way to keep fighting even though our leader went down,"" tight end Mo Alie-Cox said. ""Things happen in football, definitely feel bad for Daniel, things like that. But as an offense, we gotta let something like that not affect us during the stretch of the game, obviously next man up mentality.""

Leonard earned praise from Steichen, Raimann and Michael Pittman Jr. – to name just a few – for his effort on Sunday, despite the loss. The rookie has worked closely and consistently with Jones throughout the season, breaking down film and learning everything he can from the veteran quarterback, and it's clear his teammates recognize the effort he's put in.

Leonard finished the game 18-of-29 for 145 yards and an interception, and scrambled for his first NFL touchdown at the end of the game. It was the rookie's first meaningful minutes in the NFL; he briefly appeared in the final minutes of the Colts' Week 8 blowout over the Tennessee Titans. But the Notre Dame grad didn't look flustered or unsure of himself at any point, despite playing through pouring rain and having some of his best throws called back due to penalties.

""You see that he has talent, and the way he works, I think him and Dan are going to put in a lot of extra hours,"" Pittman said. ""I think that's the great thing about Daniel, is that his season isn't over because he's hurt, and I think he's going to do everything he can to help him out.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/colts/j357wco9yygixrv82uyy,N,,2025-12-07 19:59:33.535560

Jones has been playing with a fractured fibula in his left leg. This injury appears to be to his other leg. The Colts announced shortly after he left the game that the injury was to his Achilles tendon.

Rookie backup Riley Leonard took over for Jones at quarterback. A sixth-round draft pick out of Notre Dame, Leonard had thrown two NFL passes prior to entering Sunday's game. He finished 18-for-29 passing for 145 yards and an interception in Indianapolis' 36-19 defeat in Jacksonville.

The injury is a potentially devastating blow to the Colts' season. Jones, a seventh-season NFL veteran, is having his best campaign as a pro in his first year with the Colts after joining them in the offseason following five-plus seasons as the starter for the New York Giants.

The former first-round pick had completed 67.9% of his passes for 253.4 yards per game with 19 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 12 starts for the Colts prior to Sunday's game. The Colts fell to 8-5 as the Jaguars (9-4) secured the top spot in the AFC South.

""Definitely a challenge, but a great challenge, one that comes with the job of being the backup quarterback,"" Cook said after the Dolphins' 34-10 victory at MetLife Stadium on a gray and chilly Sunday.
For the remainder of the first half, the Jets' defense tightened, holding Miami (6-7) to a field goal.
""Forcing the ball in the end zone, trying to make plays at the end of the half,"" Cook said.
I'm going to be ready to play, ready to win the Jets a football game.","Brady Cook confronted a daunting challenge when he entered Sunday's game against Miami late in the first quarter, with the field already tilted against the home team and the Jets trailing by 21-0.

The undrafted free agent (UDFA) out of Missouri, where he was a three-year starter against top competition in the SEC, entered the game at the 2:19 mark after Miami scored 3 TDs. Starter Tyrod Taylor was forced to leave the game with a groin injury after two offensive series.

""Definitely a challenge, but a great challenge, one that comes with the job of being the backup quarterback,"" Cook said after the Dolphins' 34-10 victory at MetLife Stadium on a gray and chilly Sunday. ""I felt ready to play today, and obviously didn't do enough to get a win.""

Cook was elevated to the active roster from the practice squad when Justin Fields, Taylor's backup the last two games, was ruled out with a knee injury. With few reps in practice and facing his baptism of fire in the NFL, Cook acknowledged some early jitters, a fumbled snap and putting a bit too much mustard on passes while also dealing with a couple of dropped passes.

""I think it was on my part, maybe just a lack of trust on the timing, not quite sure where everyone's going to be exactly when they're supposed to be there,"" said Cook, who finished the game hitting on 14-of-30 passes for 163 yards and a pair of INT. ""So I think you might actually put a little bit extra juice on it, and it might appear that way.""

With the Jets (3-10) forced to chase the game early, Isaiah Williams latched onto a punt and returned it 73 yards for a TD with 42 seconds left in the first quarter. For the remainder of the first half, the Jets' defense tightened, holding Miami (6-7) to a field goal. Before the end of the half, Cook and the offense found a bit of rhythm after he connected with John Metchie III for 10 yards and then got into the red zone when Williams was interfered with by Minkah Fitzpatrick on a long pass along the visitors' sideline. The play was good for 39 yards to Miami's 16.

Three plays later, with 37 seconds left in the half, Cook's pass intended for Metchie in the end zone came up short and was intercepted by Rasul Douglas.

""Forcing the ball in the end zone, trying to make plays at the end of the half,"" Cook said. ""Throw the ball away, find your check down.""

On the Jets' third possession of the second half, which spanned the third and fourth quarters, a fake punt that RB Isaiah Davis turned into a 20-yard gain kept the drive alive. In rapid fashion, Cook completed a 15-yard toss to rookie TD Mason Taylor (5 catches, 51 yards), a 17-yard pass to Andrew Beck to Miami's 24 and another one to Taylor for 13 yards. After Breece Hall ran 6 yards to the Dolphins' 7, Cook's pass to an open Metchie slid off his hands and could not be corralled.

""I think we just ... personally, I got to be better,"" Metchie said. ""We got to execute. We got to take advantage of all the looks and opportunities that we get out there, regardless of who's out there, regardless of who's throwing the ball.""

Cook was harried throughout the game by Miami's defensive front, which sacked him 6 times and Miami's second interception with 1:19 left to play sealed the result.

""It's always tough, I mean that's the nature of being a backup quarterback,"" HC Aaron Glenn said. ""But that's really any position, you're not going to get all the reps that you want to get during the week, but mentally you have to have yourself ready to play. And for the most part, I think he was. I thought Miami did a really good job of pressuring, they brought the house a couple of times on him, but we got to do a better job.""

For Cook, being thrown into the game with limited preparation was a challenge, not an excuse.

""To have this tape, this experience to watch, to build on, to learn from, however many reps I got today that's going to be huge for me,"" Cook said. ""I look forward to seeing the tape, building off of it.

""However the reps shake out this week, next week, I'm going to be ready to play, whether the starter, whether the backup, whether the third string, it doesn't matter. I'm going to be ready to play, ready to win the Jets a football game. I think it's going to depend on how the tape looks. You know, I'm going get to watch it here shortly, and I'm going to adjust, go back to work tomorrow, and we'll get it right.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/jets/okhddhbmazwb6axjohj8,N,,2025-12-07 19:59:37.882216

Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones exited a monumental Week 14 matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars with a non-contact injury. The team later ruled him out for the rest of the game with an Achilles injury.

Jones appeared to lose his footing while planting to make a throw. He slammed his helmet while on the ground and later tried to limp off the field before falling down and requiring assistance.

The 28-year-old was playing through a fibula injury, throwing two touchdown passes apiece in losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans. Jones started, but couldn’t finish Sunday’s battle for control of the AFC South.

Dumped by the New York Giants last year, Jones resurrected his career with the Colts. They entered Sunday fourth in total offense behind the former No. 6 pick, who began the game with a career-high 101.3 quarterback rating and 8.1 yards per attempt.

His injury is a crushing blow for the AFC contender. Despite suffering consecutive losses, the Colts started Sunday two points behind the New England Patriots for the conference’s best scoring margin.

The Colts turned to another former Duke quarterback in Riley Leonard, who hadn’t completed an NFL pass before replacing Jones on Sunday. The sixth-round rookie finds himself at the center of a vital division battle between two 8-4 squads, and Indianapolis may need him during the final four games.

""Early signs say a serious injury,"" said Quinn, who added that Ertz will undergo imaging Monday.

Quarterback Jayden Daniels also left Sunday's game and didn't return after he was knocked to the ground following a third-quarter interception, landing on the left elbow that was dislocated Nov. 9. Quinn, though, said Daniels could have returned, but he opted to hold out the QB -- who was playing for the first time since his dislocation -- with the Vikings well in control.

Ertz was hurt with 2:10 left in the third quarter when he reached for a pass on second-and-11 and was hit in his leg by safety Jay Ward. Ertz had to be helped off the field and was unable to put pressure on his right leg. He was soon carted to the locker room, a towel draped over his head, and was ruled out with the knee injury early in the fourth.

""He's one of the linchpins of our team,"" receiver Terry McLaurin said. ""I ain't going to lie; it was tough for everybody.""

""It breaks my heart when you see a great one like him, an all-time great [get hurt],"" said tight end John Bates. ""He does everything the right way, the way things should be done. He's just a pro's pro.""

Ertz, 35, has 49 receptions for 493 yards and four touchdowns this season. Last week, Ertz moved into fifth place on the all-time receptions list for a tight end. He now has 825.

""This guy is one hell of a competitor in every way,"" Quinn said. ""To see the frustration and emotion with that, all of us are feeling that.""

Daniels was forced out with 8:24 remaining in the third quarter when he was hurt after he threw an interception and tried to chase down linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel. Cornerback Isaiah Rodgers blocked Daniels, who landed hard on his left elbow. He remained on the ground for a minute before sprinting to the bench. The medical stuff huddled around him and removed a padded protective device, before taking him to the medical tent.

Daniels was listed as questionable to return but remained on the sideline as Marcus Mariota took over at QB and finished out the game.

""As a team, at this point, we were off and felt like that was the right call,"" Quinn said of opting to keep Daniels from returning.

Daniels had been cleared for contact this week and was a full participant the final two days of practice. Both he and the Commanders wanted him to return, hoping to get a chance for him to play the final five games.

He still could play this season, according to Quinn.

""It's an important development time for him, but there's no zero-risk game,"" he said. ""You try to manage that. But for the development point of it, it's important.""

Daniels has finished only four of his seven starts this season and has been knocked out in each of the past three with injuries. He has been hurt three times -- a sprained knee cost him two games, a hamstring injury cost him one and the dislocated elbow cost him three.

Daniels completed 9 of 20 passes for 78 yards and an interception before exiting against the Vikings.

It was Daniels' first game back from dislocating that same left elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks. After throwing an interception to Minnesota edge defender Andrew Van Ginkel, Daniels was trying to chase down Van Ginkel when Isaiah Rodgers (legally) came in and shoved Daniels to the ground.

Daniels was in clear pain leaving the field, and Marcus Mariota came in on the ensuing drive; Mariota's first drive also ended in an interception. Daniels entered the medical tent and emerged with a towel over his head and without the arm sleeve he had been wearing over his elbow. Washington ruled him questionable to return.

Daniels suffered a plethora of injuries this season. He sprained his knee in a Week 2 loss to the Green Bay Packers and missed the next two games. He came back and helped lead the Commanders to a Week 5 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, but Washington lost in Week 6 to the Chicago Bears, and in Week 7, Daniels suffered a hamstring strain in a loss to the Dallas Cowboys. He missed one game before returning in Week 9, when he suffered the dislocated elbow.

Daniels — who was just coming back from a left elbow injury — was the first player to leave Sunday. After being intercepted, he was shoved onto his already injured left elbow and left the contest.

That brought in backup Marcus Mariota, who — not long after coming into the game — sailed a pass to veteran tight end Zach Ertz downfield. Ertz had to leap to try and make the catch. While the ball hit him in the hands, Ertz couldn't come up with the reception. Before he hit the ground, Ertz was hit directly in the knee area by Minnesota Vikings safety Jay Ward.

Content warning: Video of the injury is gruesome.

Ertz had to be helped off the field. He was emotional as he was carted back to the locker room.

The Commanders quickly ruled Ertz out for the rest of the game due to a knee injury.

After the contest, Commanders coach Dan Quinn said Ertz is feared to have torn his ACL, which explained his emotional response before being carted off the field. Ertz will undergo additional testing to confirm the injury. If he tore his ACL, Ertz would miss the rest of the 2025 NFL season.

The 35-year-old Ertz was in the midst of another solid season with the Commanders. While he's no longer a huge threat for 1,000-yard seasons, Ertz emerged as a reliable red-zone target for Daniels last season.

That connection appeared to continue this season, as Ertz caught touchdowns in each of the first two games, which were started by Daniels. Ertz then went on a scoring drought with Daniels sidelined by a knee injury. But he caught touchdowns in Daniels' next two starts.

Prior to Week 14, Ertz had 49 receptions for 493 yards and four scores, all of which came in games started by Daniels.

The loss of Jones clearly hit the Indianapolis locker room hard on Sunday.","JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — The Colts fear that starting quarterback Daniel Jones will miss the rest of the season with the Achilles injury he suffered early in Sunday’s 36-19 loss to the Jaguars.

Jones went down after releasing a throw, without taking a hit, and immediately reached for a right ankle.

Visibly upset, Jones was seen slamming his helmet to the ground and wasn’t able to leave the field without help from trainers. Doctors briefly examined Jones, then took him to the locker room and declared him out for the game immediately.

“Daniel Jones has an Achilles,” Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen said. “Could be season ending. I don’t have the full details on it, but we’ll get more clarity on that.”

Steichen typically does not reveal details on injuries after games.

But he acknowledged that the early medical assessment of Jones’ Achilles injury indicated that the team fears the worst.

“Not for sure, but it’s not looking good,” Steichen said.

An injury to Jones is a haymaker of a blow to a Colts team that was already reeling.

Indianapolis lost its 11th straight road game to the Jaguars, a defeat that gives the Colts four losses in their last five games, and the injury to Jones leaves Indianapolis in a difficult spot. The Colts had built themselves around Jones’ preparation this season.

The loss of Jones clearly hit the Indianapolis locker room hard on Sunday.

Jones has completed 68% of his passes for 3,101 yards, 8.1 yards per attempt, 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions this season, directing a Colts offense that got off to a fast start before struggling over the last month.

Without Jones — and without backup Anthony Richardson, who remains on injured reserve after undergoing surgery on his orbital bone following a freak pregame accident with a resistance band before the team’s win over Arizona — the Colts had to turn to sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard for the rest of the game Sunday.

“It’s obviously a tough situation to be in when your starting quarterback goes down,” Steichen said. “Any time you lose a guy that puts in so much work and so much effort, is always there for his team and is showing up with the fibula injury, goes out there and freaking plays, just so much respect for him.”

Jones returned to the sidelines in the second half, wearing a boot on his right foot and helping Leonard quarterback in his place.

“He was the first one to put the raincoat on me, the first one to ask me what I see on that play and help me out, what to expect on certain situations,” Leonard said. “It’s exactly who he is. He’s very consistent, win or loss.”

The Colts have rallied around Jones’ preparation and leadership this season.

Jones tried to keep his presence on the sideline Sunday.

“That’s him being a great teammate,” Steichen said. “He has a huge injury. Some guys would sit in the locker room; he wants to be out there with his guys.”

Unfortunately, it sounds like Jones may be done this season.","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/PIND/87658467007-2250563229.jpg?crop=3743,2106,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-07 19:59:41.580669

After slamming his head onto the turf on a catch attempt in the first half, Higgins went into concussion protocol and was evaluated in the Bengals' blue medical tent.
But the NFL's fake and complete sham of a concussion protocol let him come back into the game and take another needless shot when he was already vulnerable: For reference, the NFL's concussion protocol mid-game is pretty simple.

A real concussion protocol, at minimum, focused on centering a player's safety would rule players out the moment they exhibited any concussion symptoms.","We knew the NFL's supposedly rigid concussion protocol — ostensibly instituted to protect NFL players from themselves after suffering head injuries — was a farce a long time ago. But the way the Bengals handled Tee Higgins suffering an obvious concussion during Sunday's matchup against the Buffalo Bills took the league's very soft principle and made an open mockery of it.

Then again, I'm pretty confident the NFL doesn't care all that much outside of the optics.

After slamming his head onto the turf on a catch attempt in the first half, Higgins went into concussion protocol and was evaluated in the Bengals' blue medical tent. He was cleared and allowed to return to the game, even as someone who had missed Cincinnati's recent Thanksgiving game specifically because of a concussion, which has a high chance of recurrence in the immediate aftermath.

Later, when Higgins bobbled a catch over the middle, he hit his head on the turf again. It was obvious Higgins was still dealing with the effects of the first hit. But the NFL's fake and complete sham of a concussion protocol let him come back into the game and take another needless shot when he was already vulnerable:

For reference, the NFL's concussion protocol mid-game is pretty simple. Once a player shows symptoms of a concussion, they are evaluated by a person who ""spotted"" them for symptoms of a head injury. Provided they don't have any ""no-go"" symptoms, an apparent unaffiliated doctor or athletic trainer will clear them to return to the game. But this presumes that said medical professional will always act in good faith and that the player themselves won't have any direct input into their return to the field (meaning they could, in theory, try to hide their symptoms so they can still play).

A real concussion protocol, at minimum, focused on centering a player's safety would rule players out the moment they exhibited any concussion symptoms. You cannot return to a game once you show signs of a head injury. Full stop. This sentiment should go double for a guy like Higgins, who was actively recovering from another concussion only a couple of weeks ago!

Don't let the NFL lie to you. It still does not care about head injuries. It only wants you to think it does. Higgins' situation on Sunday is a perfect example of this dynamic.","https://ftw.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/SFTW/87659836007-usatsi-27765616.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-07 19:59:47.132255

It was very nearly an interception for Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who had a pass deflected in the fourth quarter. Miraculously, despite a broken wrist, Rodgers managed to reel it back in despite an interception being called on the field. Upon review, officials deemed that Rodgers was down with possession of the ball, as his knee hit the ground before giving it up to a defender.

Joe Burrow, WYD?!

Burrow had just thrown a 63-yard pick 6 to Christian Benford to give the Buffalo Bills a 32-28 lead in the fourth quarter ... and followed it up with another interception on his next pass attempt. The Bills regain possession of the ball at Cincinnati's 39-yard line.

Burrow's second interception of the game came on a pass deflection, reeled in by Bills defensive end AJ Epenesa for his second pick of the season.

Minnesota dominated from the start, beating Washington, 31-0. Vikings QB J.J. McCarthy passed for 163 yards and three touchdowns in the game. Jordan Mason had a rushing touchdown and 52 yards on the ground while Aaron Jones Sr. rushed for 76 yards.

This was the first time Washington had been shut out since 2019 and their worst shutout since Week 8 of 2005 against the New York Giants, 36-0.

Washington couldn't get anything going in this game, and to add insult to injury, quarterback Jayden Daniels left the game as he seemed to re-injure his left elbow. He passed for 78 yards and an interception before leaving the game. Marcus Mariota took over and passed for 30 yards and a touchdown. Running backs Chris Rodriguez Jr. and Jacory Croskey-Merritt combined for 84 yards on the ground.

Have a game, rookie!

26-year-old rookie Tyler Shough has regained the lead for the New Orleans Saints in Week 14 thanks to his second rushing touchdown of the day — a stunning score from 13 yards out. He somehow avoided what should have been a sack from the Buccaneers, bouncing toward the left for the score.

With just over eight minutes to go in the fourth quarter, the Saints hold a 24-17 lead over the Buccaneers as Tampa Bay looks to gain a lead in the division with a win in Week 14.

With time still left to go in the early window, Shough sits as the QB4 in Yahoo Fantasy leagues this week with 21.4 points.

Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen will not allow this game to get away as he takes it 40 yards on the ground to keep the Bills in it against the Bengals. The Bills trail the Bengals 28-25. This was the longest rushing TD of Allen's career, with his previous high coming in 2022 (36 yards).

It's been a slow 2025 season for Titans running back Tony Pollard — but things have opened up for him in Week 14. He scored his second touchdown of the day late in the third quarter, exploding up the middle for 35 yards for six.

With the successful PAT from Joey Slye, the Titans take a 21-17 lead over the Cleveland Browns heading into the fourth quarter.

Pollard had just two rushing touchdowns this season prior to Week 14. This marks his first multi-touchdown rushing game since Week 1 of the 2023 season with the Dallas Cowboys.

Washington Commanders veteran tight end Zach Ertz was carted off the field following a low hit resulting in a leg injury. Based on the severity of the hit and the look of the potential injury, it seems that the hit could have ended Ertz's season.

Content warning. The play can be seen here.

The Ravens are staying alive Sunday, as Lamar Jackson throws his first passing touchdown since Nov. 9 to TE Isaiah Likely, following up a rushing touchdown earlier in the game.

The touchdown was set up by an explosive 55-yard run from running back Keaton Mitchell, which brought the Ravens inside Pittsburgh's 10.

Despite his two scores, it's been an up-and-down contest for Jackson so far, going 8-of-14 for 68 yards, 1 touchdown and 1 interception, currently with a 64.0 NFL passer rating. Zay Flowers currently sits as the team's leading receiver, having caught three of seven targets for 46 receiving yards.

Bills running back James Cook fumbles for the second time in the same drive, but the second time, the Bengals recover in the end zone and take over possession.

On an earlier play in the drive, Cook broke a long run, and as he dove for the end zone, the ball was knocked out by a Bengals defender but went out of bounds around the one-yard line. Cincinnati leads Buffalo 21-18 in the third quarter.

Seahawks WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba continues to bolster his campaign for Offensive Player of the Year, scoring his ninth touchdown of the season on Sunday.

JSN currently leads the league with 1,423 receiving yards and a 128.6 NFL passer rating when targeted, averaging 16.2 yards per reception. He currently leads the team with 88 receiving yards and would manage his ninth game of 100-plus receiving yards this season with another 12 in Week 14.

Weather may just be becoming a factor in the Saints-Bucs Week 14 matchup, as rain pours down ... and Bucs quarterback Baker Mayfield makes a devastating interception to set the Saints up for the go-ahead touchdown — a 33-yard rushing touchdown from 26-year-old rookie quarterback Tyler Shough.

That marks the first rushing touchdown of Shough's career, making his fifth career start Sunday as New Orleans looks to evaluate their future at the position. The Saints selected Shough with the 40th overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/3ELiNcpiGNqacmFaJ_j.hg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-12/b9902310-d39e-11f0-aefb-7eeb125fdcc5,N,,2025-12-07 16:00:58.796532

Daniels' injury occurred after he threw a fourth-down interception. The quarterback was trying to chase down the intercepting player, Andrew Van Ginkel, when Vikings cornerback Isaiah Rodgers came and threw a block on him.

Daniels went tumbling to the ground as a result of the block. As he did, he hit his left elbow – which he previously dislocated in Week 9 – on the ground. He briefly remained hunched over in pain on the field before making his way back to the sideline.

Originally, Daniels sat on the bench while receiving medical attention. Before long, he had the brace on his left elbow removed and made his way to the blue medical tent.

Daniels was officially deemed ""questionable"" to return by the Commanders because of his elbow injury.

Daniels remained in the medical tent on Washington's first drive after his injury. He eventually exited the tent wearing a towel on his head and without a wrap on his injured arm.

Marcus Mariota checked into the game to replace Daniels. The veteran threw an interception on his first drive in place of the second-year quarterback.

Now the running back is dealing with an injury that puts his availability in doubt. Achane exited Week 14 with a rib injury and headed to the locker room prior to halftime.

In many ways, Achane is the engine that powers Mike McDaniel's offense. The Dolphins are trying to keep their slim playoff hopes alive, but losing the star running back certainly won't help their ability to compete going forward.

Here's the latest on Achane.

De'Von Achane injury update

Achane is questionable to return with a rib injury.

The running back departed after being evaluated in the blue medical tent. Achane was carving up the New York Jets defense in the first half, totaling 105 scrimmage yards and a touchdown on just eight touches.

Miami jumped out to a 21-7 lead by the end of the first quarter, remaining in complete control on the road against the rival Jets.

The 5-7 Dolphins entered Week 14 with a 1% chance of making the playoffs, according to NFL Next Gen Stats. It remains to be seen if that will play a part in how Miami handles the injury to their star.

Jaylen Wright

Achane has been a do-it-all running back for the Dolphins, making him the clear RB1 atop the depth chart.

The rookie, Gordon, leapfrogged Wright towards the end of the preseason. A more physical back, the Oklahoma State product doesn't typically see a lot of work, having recorded just 53 carries this season.

Wright has been buried on the depth chart, totaling just 18 carries in his second season.

Jones dropped back to throw late in the first quarter and seemed to lose his footing as he delivered the throw. He fell to the wet turf and immediately grabbed his right lower leg area. He has also been dealing a fibula fracture in his left leg over the past several weeks.

Jones proceeded to slam his helmet to the turf multiple times before he was helped to his feet and walked gingerly to the injury tent. A few minutes later, he walked slowly to the locker room and was ruled out of the game.

Jones had played the past two games with his fibula injury (believed to be a hairline fracture), which had restricted his mobility in losses to the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans. He seemed to be moving more fluidly on Sunday before sustaining his Achilles injury, even scrambling for a first down early in the game.

The injury leaves the Colts in an extremely difficult situation given the facial injury that forced backup and 2023 first-round choice Anthony Richardson Sr. to injured reserve. Sixth-round pick Riley Leonard, a rookie from Notre Dame, replaced Jones in the lineup, playing the first meaningful snaps of his career.

Facing third-and-8 from Indianapolis’ 42-yard line, Jones dropped back to pass, but after throwing a 7-yard pass to wide receiver Alec Pierce, he immediately fell to the ground and clutched at his right Achilles. The Colts ruled him out a short while later.

Colts running back Jonathan Taylor was flagged for a chop block, which negated the play, but while the refs sorted out the penalty, Jones remained down. He slammed his helmet on the ground in frustration before eventually getting up and limping over to the sideline. Jones was briefly looked at in the medical tent, dropping his head into his hands as he hopped on the table, before heading back to the locker room and being quickly ruled out due to an Achilles injury.

Riley Leonard replaced Jones at quarterback. The rookie, a sixth-round pick in the 2025 draft, had logged just six snaps and two pass attempts (zero completions) this season entering Sunday’s contest. Leonard took over the QB2 role in Week 6 after Anthony Richardson Sr., the 2023 No. 4 pick, suffered an orbital fracture during a pregame warmup accident.

If Jones is indeed out for the season due to a right Achilles injury, it would be a devastating blow for the Colts. Jones, who signed a one-year, $14 million deal to join Indianapolis in free agency, had been a revelation since winning the starting job over Richardson. He powered the Colts to a 7-1 start, and The Athletic’s Dianna Russini reported that the Colts and Jones’ representatives were set to begin contract extension talks after the season. Indianapolis believed in Jones so much that it traded wide receiver AD Mitchell and its next two first-round picks — essentially two chances to draft another quarterback — to the Jets to acquire two-time, first-team All-Pro cornerback Sauce Gardner. Gardner went down last week with a left calf injury and is out indefinitely.

Jones had already been playing through a fractured left fibula, which the Colts believed would heal as the season went on. The QB was moving better Sunday than he had in previous weeks, but his day was cut short due to the Achilles injury, which could have far-reaching implications not only for Jones but the future of the Colts franchise.

The only other quarterback on the Colts’ roster is third-stringer Brett Rypien, whom the team signed after Richardson was placed on injured reserve. However, since Indianapolis did not call Rypien up from the practice squad to the active roster for Sunday’s game, he can not step in if Leonard were to get hurt. The Colts’ emergency QB in this scenario is lefty tight end Tyler Warren, who played QB in high school.

Looking beyond Sunday, Colts coach Shane Steichen kept the door open for Richardson to return later this season. While he didn’t have a timeline, he said the team is “hopeful” Richardson will return to the team this season.

“He’s just resting his eye right now, and when that time comes, I’ll let you guys know for sure,” Steichen said recently. “Obviously, anytime you’re dealing with an eye, you want to make sure he’s got full vision in that eye.”",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/07134726/GettyImages-2250558506-1-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-07 15:00:26.336062

Jones, who was playing through a fracture in his left leg, dropped back to pass and fell down without anyone touching him. On the ground he grabbed his right ankle near the Achilles tendon and shook his head as if he believed he had just suffered a bad injury.

After a break, Jones was able to walk to the locker room under his own power, rather than getting carted off the field. The Colts announced that he is out for the game with an Achilles injury.

It’s been a comeback season for Jones, who signed a one-year contract with the Colts in the offseason and has been playing some of his best football this season. He looked poised to sign a lucrative contract in 2026, but this injury may change that.

The Indianapolis Colts quarterback is already dealing with a fractured fibula. Now, he's dealing with a new injury in Week 14. While the left leg was the one with the fracture, Jones appeared to suffer a non-contact injury to his right Achilles on a rainy day in Jacksonville.

In the midst of a playoff race, Indianapolis can ill afford to lose the quarterback that has been key to their success. And for Jones, it's a tough reality to face after reviving his career with the Colts.

Here's the latest on Jones.

Daniel Jones injury update

Jones has been ruled out with an Achilles injury.

The quarterback limped to the locker room after being evaluated in the blue medical tent with a non-contact right leg injury.

It wasn't a good-looking scene in Jacksonville as Jones fell to the ground after a throw on third down. He immediately reached for his right calf, slamming his helmet on the field as trainers evaluated the injury.

Riley Leonard came into the game to replace Jones.

The Colts are rolling with just two healthy quarterbacks on their active roster. Jones has owned the QB1 since winning the competition over Anthony Richardson during the offseason.

Richardson has been on injured reserve with an orbital fracture, leaving Leonard as the other remaining signal caller on the roster.

Leonard was drafted by the Colts in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL Draft. The Notre Dame product made a brief cameo appearance on Oct. 26 against the Tennessee Titans, but hasn't seen any other game action in his rookie season.

Brett Rypien is on the Indianapolis practice squad, but he was not elevated to the active roster for Week 14. If Leonard falls victim to injury, the Colts will be without a traditional quarterback the rest of the way.

Leonard was a sixth-round selection out of Notre Dame, throwing for 2,861 yards, 21 touchdowns and 8 interceptions in his final season with the Irish after spending the three years of his collegiate career at Duke. Leonard added another 906 rushing yards and 17 touchdowns on the ground.

It's brutal news for Jones, amidst a potential Comeback Player of the Year campaign in his first year with the Indianapolis Colts. His 19 passing touchdowns marked the second most of his career since his rookie season with the New York Giants.

Jones entered this game with a career-high 67.9% completion rate and 11.9 yards per completion average. Jones entered the week leading the league in successful pass rate, per Pro Football Reference.

The Colts and Jaguars are fighting for sole possession of first place in the AFC South with a win in Week 14.

Indianapolis Colts quarterback Daniel Jones is down with what appears to be a right lower-leg injury.

Jones was able to stand up initially after the play but was unable to make his way off the field without assistance, slamming his helmet into the field several times before making his way off with trainers. He is now in the blue medical tent.

He'll be replaced with Riley Leonard, as former first-round pick Anthony Richardson remains on injured reserve after suffering an orbital fracture in pre-game warmups in a fluke accident back in Week 6.

Jakobi Meyers continues to prove himself worthy of Jacksonville's mid-season trade to acquire him.

He's now had four consecutive games with 50-plus yards or a touchdown, with at least 41 receiving yards in each of his four games with the Jaguars leading up to Week 14.

After punting on the opening drive, Jacksonville has now scored on back-to-back drives, with Trevor Lawrence having gone 7-of-9 for 107 passing yards and a touchdown. Second-year WR Brian Thomas Jr. leads the team with 57 receiving yards in his second game returning from injury after missing several games with an ankle injury.

The New Orleans Saints are on the board early!

Set up with a strong 54-yard return from WR Mason Tipton, the Saints needed just 2:27 before scoring the first touchdown of the day — a three-yard run up the middle from RB Devin Neal.

Neal, a sixth-round rookie, made his first career start in Week 13, but had a modest day with just 47 rushing yards. He gets the start today in place of Alvin Kamara, who's been out with knee and ankle injuries and didn't practice ahead of Week 14.

Gardner suffered the injury on the second defensive play of the Colts' Week 14 matchup with the Houston Texans.

In Gardner's first two games with the Colts, he has allowed five receptions on 10 targets for 38 yards with two pass breakups. He's also made 12 tackles.

McCarthy’s angst, or lack thereof. Can he just play? Is he cringing after throws, trying to ensure every pass and decision is perfect? Or can he center himself and let it rip? O’Connell talked about all of this earlier this week and now says, “Let’s just make the throws. Let’s just throw and catch.”

Perhaps doing that will allow McCarthy’s arm talent to take over. Maybe his lower body mechanics will still falter, yet he’ll be able to make up for it with feel and adaptability. Is it likely? I’m not so sure. Is it possible? Yes. McCarthy has five games until 2026 to prove he can stay healthy and make the throws required in NFL games. Consistency for four quarters is the goal. Even if the Commanders’ defense may be more capable than the numbers suggest, this is an opponent that presents a better opportunity than most.

BALTIMORE — When the Steelers traded George Pickens this offseason, general manager Omar Khan insisted that the team had enough talent and depth at the position. Part of the reason Khan felt that way was because he expected Roman Wilson to take a big step in Year 2.

Thirteen weeks later, Wilson is inactive for the most important game of the season in Baltimore, as two 6-6 teams clash with the lead in the AFC North on the line. The move makes way for Adam Thielen (who was claimed off waivers this week) and Marquez Valdes-Scantling (who was promoted from the practice squad for the first time as a Steeler).

While the roster decision was necessary, it's another reminder of how poor player evaluation and roster construction put the Steelers in their current situation. It comes just one week after Darius Slay, who the Steelers believed could help lock down anyone in man coverage, was inactive and then waived.

Last season, the Steelers’ receiver depth chart featured Pickens at the top — a huge gap — and then everyone else. The Steelers shuffled some pieces at the top by acquiring Metcalf and dealing Pickens, but it still looked like they had one legitimate WR1 and then a bunch of uncertainty.

“I know people make comparison to last year, but it’s not even close to being the same,” Khan said in May. “We made the investment in DK. We’ve had another year with some of the young guys, gotten to know them, watch them develop. We added Robert Woods. Roman [Wilson's] healthy. Seeing him the last couple of weeks out here and how he’s doing. We saw how he was progressing at the end of last year. Obviously, he didn’t have a chance to get on the field, but there was some excitement there. We have a good group.”

Woods didn’t even make the team. Wilson, who has 12 receptions for 166 yards, hasn’t taken a significant step forward. And Calvin Austin III has only 17 receptions for 180 yards, one year after he posted 36 catches for 548.

As quarterback Aaron Rodgers has criticized this group for failing to create enough separation, the Steelers have made some moves recently to reshape the position. While the changes make a difference or will it be too little, too late?

The Steelers’ other inactive players are: QB Will Howard (3rd QB), S Kyle Dugger, OL Calvin Anderson, DT Brodric Martin-Rhodes, WR Ke'Shawn Williams and DT Derrick Harmon.

Sole possession of first place in the AFC South is at stake in the first game between the 8-4 Jaguars and Colts this month. No Parker Washington for the Jaguars in a windswept, sodden Jacksonville. A lightning delay is possible…

But DE Travon Walker returns for the NFL’s No. 1 run defense, which should prove handy against Jonathan Taylor. This is a step up in class for Jacksonville, who are yet to play a top 10 rushing offense.

The Colts last won in Jacksonville in September 2014, when quarterback Chad Henne was benched for Blake Bortles in a 44-17 defeat.

Things to watch: Trevor Lawrence (as always). Not only if he takes care of the football, but his ability to run.

Brian Thomas Jr. With Washington out, can he stretch the field (and hold on to the football)?

And the pass rush. Can the returning Arik Armstead and Walker pressure the hampered Daniel Jones?

LB Yasir Abdullah

The Browns are shorthanded on their offensive line today due to injury, but they have defensive ends Alex Wright and Isaiah McGuire healthy and active.

Wright missed the last two games with a quad injury, and McGuire had been questionable due to a knee injury. Rookie running back Dylan Sampson, rookie defensive tackle Mason Graham and defensive tackle Mike Hall Jr. are also active despite having been listed as questionable.

The big changes are on the offensive line, where KT Leveston takes over at right tackle for Jack Conklin (concussion) and Teven Jenkins replaces Wyatt Teller (calf) at right guard. Jenkins makes his first start for the Browns after alternating series with Teller last week. The Browns are slated to start their eighth different offensive line combination this season.

Defensive end Myles Garrett enters the game with 19 sacks, 3.5 from tying the single-season record currently shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt. Nobody's been sacked more this season than Titans rookie Cam Ward (48), and Garrett is on a tear. Garrett already has three games this season of at least three sacks; he had four last month vs. the Ravens and five in October at New England.

Expect to see 1-11 Tennessee's game plan revolve around not letting Garrett to the record. The Browns have been outstanding on defense all season and had 10 sacks, one short of a franchise record, in Week 12 at Las Vegas.

Garrett's pursuit of history and rookie Shedeur Sanders' quest to put himself in the team's long-term plans are the two most compelling storylines surrounding the 3-9 Browns. Sanders makes his third start today after the Browns managed just one touchdown in last week's 26-8 loss to the 49ers.

Sanders' 34-yard touchdown pass to rookie tight end Harold Fannin Jr. gave Cleveland its only score last week in a game plan that was centered around the running of rookie Quinshon Judkins. Expect another run-heavy plan today with another makeshift offensive line in place. Fannin has been Sanders' favorite target and there's no reason to expect that to change when the Browns go to the air.

Judkins ran 23 times for 91 yards last week. Judkins, Fannin, Graham and linebacker Carson Schwesinger headline an outstanding Cleveland rookie class. Schwesinger is the favorite to win NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and has consistently made big plays while opposing offenses devote extra attention to Garrett and defensive tackle Maliek Collins, who had 6.5 sacks before suffering a season-ending quad injury last week. Both Hall and veteran Shelby Harris will see increased snaps in Collins' absence.

Quarterback Justin Fields is out with a knee injury, as expected, for Jets-Dolphins so undrafted rookie Brady Cook — signed to the active roster off the practice squad on Saturday — will be the No. 2 quarterback behind Tyrod Taylor. Fields reported knee soreness this week and missed Friday's practice — this coming a week after Fields told reporters he wasn't exactly keen on being a ""Wildcat"" quarterback option for the Jets offense because of the risk of injury. It's fair to wonder if Fields has played his last game in a Jets uniform.

And the Jets will likely, at some point, get a chance to see what they have in Cook as a potential future backup option. Taylor has a history of injury issues and there's no guarantee he'll stay healthy long enough to start each of the five remaining games. Cook has been getting more No. 2 reps in practice this week as a result.","https://cdn-media.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=cover/xzBsRZARiMQs_O7v3TBSC1OdV_1440x960.jpg",N,,2025-12-07 13:00:45.866297

Wirfs' only practice of the week was a limited one on Friday and he was listed as questionable on the Bucs' Friday injury report.
Wirfs was also sidelined for the first three games of the 2025 season after undergoing knee surgery in July.

New Orleans had listed leading receiver Chris Olave as questionable on Friday's injury report but he has been cleared to play.","When the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and New Orleans Saints meet for a Week 14 rematch on Sunday, neither team will have the services of one of their starting offensive tackles.

For the Buccaneers, that means the absence of All-Pro left tackle Tristan Wirfs, who suffered an oblique injury in last week's win over the Arizona Cardinals. Wirfs' only practice of the week was a limited one on Friday and he was listed as questionable on the Bucs' Friday injury report. Wirfs was also sidelined for the first three games of the 2025 season after undergoing knee surgery in July.

Meanwhile, the Saints will be without their starting right tackle, 2024 first-round pick Taliese Fuaga. Like Wirfs, Fuaga has also missed three other games this season due to back and knee issues. He was ruled out on Friday by the Saints due to a new ankle injury.

The Buccaneers and Saints submitted their list of inactives at 11:30 a.m. ET on Sunday, 90 minutes before the scheduled kickoff of their Week 14 meeting at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. The Buccaneers elevated safety Marcus Banks from their practice squad for the game and thus had to name six inactives to get down to the game-day limit of 48. The Saints elevated wide receiver Kevin Austin and kicker Charlie Smyth from their practice squad and were required to name seven players inactive.

In addition to the absence of Fuaga, the Saints will also play Sunday's game without running back Alvin Kamara and starting safety Justin Reid, both of whom are dealing with knee issues. Kamara, who also is listed on the injury report with an ankle ailment, will miss a second consecutive game.

Drake London, WR, ATL (knee): He didn't practice all week. Who knows? Maybe David Sills V will catch another TD pass on Sunday.

Ty Chandler, RB, MIN (knee): Aaron Jones Sr. (shoulder) and Jordan Mason will split carries as Chandler was not activated from IR, despite practicing all week.

Justin Fields, QB, NYJ (knee): Brady Cook was elevated from the practice squad to be the backup to Tyrod Taylor.

Mike Evans, WR, TB (collarbone): Although his window to return from IR has been opened, the receiver apparently still needs more time to recover.

Jalen McMillan, WR, TB (neck): McMillan also needs more time to get back up to speed from an injury suffered in the preseason. Meanwhile, Chris Godwin Jr. (fibula) was not on the team's final injury report and will play.

Dalton Kincaid, TE, BUF (hamstring): Sean McDermott didn't seem willing to commit to Kincaid playing on Sunday, but he is active. Dawson Knox may still see a share of the targets.

Dylan Sampson, RB, CLE (calf): Quinshon Judkins will handle the lead back duties but with Sampson active, he and Jerome Ford will likely split what's left over.

Blake Grupe, K, IND: After releasing Michael Badgley, the Colts have elevated the former Saints kicker from the practice squad.

Chris Olave, WR, NO (back): He played last week while dealing with this same injury, so it's not a surprise to see he is active for this one.

Biggest NFL Week 14 Injuries:

Daniel Jones Injury Update

Colts QB Daniel Jones hobbled to the locker room in the first half on Sunday after suffering a non-contact injury to his left leg.

Jones has been dealing with a stress fracture in his right leg in recent weeks, but has played through the pain thanks to a 3D-printed brace.

Riley Leonard replaced Jones at quarterback.

CeeDee Lamb Injury Update

Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb suffered a concussion when he came down hard on the turf attempting to make a catch on Thursday night.

Coach Brian Schottenheimer said Lamb “had a good day” on Friday, but the receiver still has to go through the concussion protocol.

He will get a few more days than usual to clear the protocol with the Cowboys next playing on December 14, but it is not a given he is ready to go by then.

George Pickens will take back over as the clear No. 1 target if Lamb is forced to sit out a game.

Let’s examine where smart money is leaning for a trio of matchups using our VSiN NFL Betting Splits, which are updated every 5 minutes and come directly from DraftKings and Circa Sports.

1 p.m. ET: Miami Dolphins (-2.5, 41.5) at New York Jets

The Dolphins (5-7) have won three games in a row and just held off the Saints 21-17 but failed to cover as 5.5-point home favorites. On the other hand, the Jets (3-9) just snapped a two-game losing skid with a 27-24 win over the Falcons, winning outright as 3-point home dogs.

This line opened with Miami listed as a 3-point road favorite.

The public is happy to lay the short chalk with the surging Dolphins. However, despite receiving 63% of spread bets at DraftKings we’ve seen Miami fall from -3 to -2.5.

Why would the oddsmakers drop the line and make it easier for the public to cover when they’re already backing the Dolphins to begin with? Because respected wiseguy action has jumped on the Jets plus the points, triggering sharp reverse line movement in their favor.

New York has betting system value as a divisional dog, with the built in familiarity leveling the playing field and benefiting the team getting points.

Divisional dogs getting 3-points or less are 10-8 ATS (56%) with a 7% ROI this season and 99-80 ATS (55%) with a 7% ROI since 2020.

Tyrod Taylor is 3-0 ATS this season and 36-21 ATS (63%) with a 21% ROI in his career, including 24-12 ATS (67%) with a 26% ROI as a dog.

The Jets have additional betting system value as a dog in a low total game (41.5), with the fewer amount of expected points scored making it harder for the favorite to cover the number.

The Dolphins are 4-3 at home this season but just 1-4 on the road. Miami is also in a fade “weather” spot as a warm southern team going north in December. Tua Tagovailoa is 0-7 when the temperature is 46 degrees or less. The forecast calls for 40 degree temperatures today at MetLife Stadium.

The Jets could also be worth a look in a wiseguy Wong Teaser. By taking New York up from +2.5 to +8.5, savvy pros can pass through the top key numbers of 3 and 7.

1 p.m. ET: Indianapolis Colts (-1.5, 45.5) at Jacksonville Jaguars

The Colts (8-4) have dropped three of their last four games and just fell to the Texans 20-16, losing outright as 3-point home favorites. Meanwhile, the Jaguars (8-4) have won three straight and just brushed aside the Titans 25-3, easily covering as 6-point road favorites.

This line opened with Indianapolis listed as a 3-point road favorite.

The public still believes in the Colts and 55% of spread bets at DraftKings are laying the points with Indianapolis.

However, despite receiving a slight majority of tickets we’ve seen the Colts fall from -3 to -1.5. The movement toward Jacksonville has been steady and consistent all week without any notable buyback on Indianapolis. This signals sharp reverse line movement in favor of the Jaguars at home.

At Circa, the Jaguars are taking in 84% of spread bets and a whopping 95% of spread dollars, a one-way “low bets, higher dollars” bet discrepancy and further evidence of heavy pro action backing the home dog out in Vegas.

Jacksonville has betting system value as a divisional dog and is also in a prime Wong Teaser position (+1.5 to +7.5).

We’ve also seen a heavy dose of smart money play the under, dropping the total from 47.5 to 45.5, with some shops inching down to 45 on gameday.

At DraftKings, the under is taking in 43% of bets but 72% of dollars, a sharp contrarian split in favor of a lower scoring game.

Outdoor divisional unders are 24-15 (62%) with an 18% ROI this season and 322-267 (55%) with a 6% ROI since 2017.

1 p.m. ET: Cincinnati Bengals at Buffalo Bills (-6, 54.5)

The Bengals (4-8) just snapped a four-game losing streak with a 32-14 win over the Ravens, winning outright as 7.5-point road dogs. Meanwhile, the Bills (8-4) just took down the Steelers 26-7, easily covering as 3-point road favorites.

This line opened with Buffalo listed as a 6.5-point home favorite.

Sharps have jumped on the Bengals plus the points, dropping Cincinnati from +6.5 to +6. Some shops even touched down to +5.5 earlier in the week. Essentially, all movement and liability has been in favor of the Bengals plus the points.

At Circa, the Bengals are receiving 50% of spread bets and 61% of spread dollars, a “low bets, higher dollars” bet discrepancy indicating public indecision but also respected smart money out in Vegas.

Dogs who missed the playoffs the previous season playing an opponent who made the playoffs the previous season are 45-34 ATS (57%) with a 9% ROI this year. If the dog is getting 6-points or more, they improve to 26-16 ATS (62%) with a 19% ROI this season.

Joe Burrow is 20-11 ATS (65%) with a 24% ROI as a dog in his career.

The Bengals enjoy a 3-day rest advantage, having last played on Thanksgiving (Thursday) while the Bills last played on Sunday.

Pros also seem to be expecting a higher scoring game, as the total has been bet up from 51.5 to 54.5.

At DraftKings, the over is taking in 63% of bets and 65% of dollars.

Denver Broncos (-7.5) over LAS VEGAS RAIDERS Surprised this spread is so low for a 10-2 vs. 2-10 matchup.
1 in the NFL in yards and points allowed per game.","It’s week 14 in the NFL, and with the Giants at 2-11 and Jets at 3-9, it’s already draft season in the East Rutherford.

Let’s not get too deep into the question of whether the Jets should tank for Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, because they’re not doing that.

(As an early aside, we don’t really even know yet if Mendoza will end up being “The Guy.” There’s still a showdown with Ohio State on Saturday, the entire College Football Playoff, and all of the pre-draft hype and marketing).

The Jets have won two in a row to drop below the expected Mendoza line, and any more success would cause them to have to trade way too much of the haul they just got for Sauce Gardner and Quinnen Williams.

You can also make the case that it would be better for the Jets to build their team out a little more and add the QB of the future next year, when they have three No. 1 picks. If Oregon’s Dante Moore and/or Alabama’s Ty Simpson stay on campus, the 2027 draft will be chock-full of quarterbacks.

It could be instructive that the current holders of the top two picks — the Titans and Giants — drafted quarterbacks into bad teams and already have fired their head coaches. Cam Ward (first) and Jaxson Dart (25th) could still end up being cornerstone players, but their teams remain in terrible shape.

If I’m Darren Mougey and Aaron Glenn, I look for a home-run hitter at wide receiver and keep building the wall on the offensive line. Whenever the new quarterback arrives, he’d be equipped to succeed. I’d also trade down a few times to add picks in the third and fourth rounds. This is how Glenn will be able to build the defense he wants with “his guys.”

As for Sunday’s game against the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium, I think the tank fans will get to keep grousing. The Jets have risen to seventh in rushing yards per game while the Dolphins are 29th in rushing yards allowed. The Jets special teams also could continue to make a difference. Now, if they could only force a turnover or two on defense …

Oh, and fun fact: Guess which team is the best against the spread in the AFC. It’s the Jets at 8-4.

The pick: Jets +3.

One week, the Steelers defense gives up three touchdown passes to Caleb Williams in a 31-28 loss at the Bears. The next, 249 rushing yards in a 26-7 home trampling by the Bills. Not what you want with Derrick Henry and Lamar Jackson ahead. Aaron Rodgers is also dealing with a fractured wrist and mangled nose.

Seattle Seahawks (-7) over ATLANTA FALCONS

Both teams are in the top four in sacks. I trust Sam Darnold to handle the pressure a little better than Kirk Cousins. It’s a lot of points to give on the road, and the Falcons can still be dangerous, but if you like the Seahawks to win, you might as well lay the number. Seven of their nine wins have been by eight points or more.

Cincinnati Bengals (+5.5) over BUFFALO BILLS

The Bengals have a few extra days after their stunning Thursday rout in Baltimore. The weather forecast is in the Bills’ favor — 29 degrees with a few snow showers. Hoping this great Joe Burrow-Josh Allen QB matchup delivers a close game.

CLEVELAND BROWNS (-4) over Tennessee Titans

The Titans rank 32nd in yards per game and points per game. Myles Garrett’s front lawn is one of the last places they’d like to be, particularly with temperatures dropping into the 20s. All but one of the Titans’ 11 loses have been by six points or more.

Washington Commanders (+2) over MINNESOTA VIKINGS

After back-to-back overtime losses to the Dolphins and Broncos to run their losing streak to seven games, the Commanders are ready to win one. Terry McLaurin makes all the difference. Keep an eye on the injury news as both Jayden Daniels and J.J. McCarthy are attempting to return.

TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS (-8.5) over New Orleans Saints

The Bucs should just hang a “Questionable” sign on Raymond James Stadium, given all of the top players on offense who might or might not play Sunday. The defense, however, is intact, and New Orleans is averaging just 13.5 ppg in Tyler Shough’s four starts.

JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS (+1.5) over Indianapolis Colts

The teams are tied at 8-4 atop the AFC South with the Texans on their heels. The Colts’ record breaks down to 6-1 home/neutral and just 2-3 on the road. The Jags are 4-2 at home. Daniel Jones is playing on a broken leg and Sauce Gardner (calf) is doubtful for Indianapolis.

Denver Broncos (-7.5) over LAS VEGAS RAIDERS

Surprised this spread is so low for a 10-2 vs. 2-10 matchup. Maybe it’s because the Raiders covered in a 10-7 loss at Denver on Nov. 6. The Raiders are done until the draft party, as I see it. And now Geno Smith is dealing with a foot injury. Any loss of mobility would be critical against the swarming Denver defense. This could be a chance for Courtland Sutton and Evan Engram to flex a little.

Chicago Bears (+6.5) over GREEN BAY PACKERS

I’ve seen some Packers backers point to the Bears plus-17 turnover differential as something that’s unsustainable. Keeping an eye on this phenomenon over the years, my sense (without any official statistics) is that the big takeaway teams can keep doing it throughout the season before it becomes a regression point the next year.

The Lambeau after-dark weather will have a real feel of around zero degrees, but I don’t see that as much of an edge for the Pack against another cold-weather team.

Los Angeles Rams (-8) over ARIZONA CARDINALS

Unlike Broncos-Raiders, this line strikes as a little high for a 9-3 team at a 3-9. The Cardinals did cover a +4 last week at Tampa Bay. Happy to back the Rams off a loss. Since Oct. 12, five of their six wins have been by 14 points or more, so that takes some of the trepidation away from this number.

Houston Texans (+3.5) over KANSAS CITY CHIEFS

Keeping an eye on injury news for the right side of the Chiefs offensive line, where there are questions about Trey Smith and Jawaan Taylor. If they’re out or compromised, Patrick Mahomes will be looking at a face full of Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr., as the Texans defense ranks No. 1 in the NFL in yards and points allowed per game. Anderson also won’t forget the laughable roughing the passer called on him in last season’s playoff game at Arrowhead.

Philadelphia Eagles (-3) over LOS ANGELES CHARGERS

The Eagles offense isn’t completely broken. A.J. Brown has 242 receiving yards in the past two games, both losses. This pick is mainly built on the defending champs circling the wagons for a Monday night road game in which they might have the crowd advantage. That could spur them on. Also, Justin Herbert had surgery Monday to insert a plate and screws into his non-throwing hand. He’s preparing to play, but that can’t feel good. And three of the Chargers’ four losses have been by 14 points or more.

McCarthy's redshirt rookie season in the NFL hasn't gone to plan. In his return from last year's torn meniscus, the Vikings signal-caller has started just six of a possible 12 games, struggling in many of them.

Ahead of McCarthy's third campaign in Minnesota, expect the franchise to buttress him with some help in the quarterback room.

The Vikings are expected to add a veteran QB this offseason in an effort to ""enhance"" the room and ""push"" McCarthy, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported Sunday on NFL GameDay Morning.

McCarthy will be entering the third year of his rookie contract in 2026. The only other QB slated to be on the roster is undrafted rookie Max Brosmer, who was dreadful in his lone start for Minnesota this campaign (19-of-30 passing for 126 yards and four interceptions in the Vikings' Week 13 shutout loss to Seattle). McCarthy missed that game with a concussion but is set to return Sunday for the 4-8 Vikings against the Washington Commanders (3-9).

Carson Wentz was McCarthy's backup this year and served as a competent fill-in in the five games the starter missed due to a high ankle sprain. Wentz, who will be 33 at the start of next season, is currently on season-ending injured reserve after undergoing left shoulder surgery.

McCarthy, 22, is familiar with sharing the Vikings' QB room with a veteran with significant starting experience. Wentz and 2024 starter Sam Darnold were both top-three picks with a combined 150 starts before joining Minnesota.

Darnold was a stop-gap option ahead of the No. 10 pick McCarthy in 2024 but exceeded expectations and led the Vikings to 14-3 record and a playoff appearance. Minnesota let him walk to Seattle in the offseason, handing the starting reins to McCarthy and adding Wentz late in the summer to back him up. Daniel Jones, a former No. 6 selection who finished the 2024 campaign on Minnesota's practice squad, also left in the offseason to Indianapolis.

If the Vikings add a new QB in the 2026 offseason, he could be more Wentz than Darnold or Jones, capable of pushing McCarthy and showing him the ropes but not a signal-caller in his prime.

McCarthy has had his moments in his second NFL campaign, leading a furious comeback against Chicago in Week 1 and beating the Lions in his return from the ankle injury. But he's had as many if not more down days, most recently in Week 12 against Green Bay, when he threw for just 87 yards on 19 attempts, tossing two picks and taking five sacks in a 23-6 defeat.

Who could join McCarthy in Minnesota in 2026? There are a slew of veteran options, including Russell Wilson, Marcus Mariota, Tyrod Taylor, Joe Flacco, Jimmy Garoppolo, ex-Vikings Case Keenum and Teddy Bridgewater and, yes, Wentz. Jones and Aaron Rodgers are also not currently under contract for the upcoming campaign, but they are starting-caliber QBs; plus, Jones will surely be extended and Rodgers is more likely than not headed to retirement.

Whoever accompanies McCarthy in the QB room next season, he will be pivotal alongside coach Kevin O'Connell, a supposed QB whisperer, in bringing the Michigan man along and unleashing his first-round potential.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/hbmic5ovwq22hceae5kp,N,,2025-12-07 13:01:11.409886

Baltimore (6-6) is also trying to bounce back with a win, having lost on Thanksgiving against the Bengals. Prior to last week's loss, the Ravens had won five straight games after starting the season with a 1-5 record.

Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson missed several games with injury earlier this season and has thrown for 15 touchdowns and just 4 interceptions in the nine games he's played in.

Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Parker Washington will not play in today’s Week 14 matchup against the Indianapolis Colts. The announcement comes after Washington was listed as questionable earlier in the week due to a hip injury suffered during Jacksonville’s win over the Tennessee Titans. Reports from NFL Network's Ian Rapoport on December 7 confirmed that the Jaguars are choosing caution, ruling him out. Washington exited last week’s game early and followed a DNP/limited/limited practice pattern heading into Sunday. Despite progress, the team determined he was not ready to return to full-speed action.

Washington has played an important role this season as Jacksonville’s No. 3 wide receiver, contributing both as a pass-catcher and a return specialist. In 12 games so far, he has recorded 36 receptions for 447 yards and three touchdowns, with 23 receptions resulting in first downs. His special teams value has also been notable, adding two punt return touchdowns this year. Without him, the Jaguars will rely on a rotation to fill his role. Tim Patrick, Dyami Brown, and recently elevated receiver Austin Trammell are expected to split snaps behind starters Brian Thomas Jr. and Jakobi Meyers. Trammell is also expected to take over punt return duties.

Jaguars make roster adjustments ahead of Week 14

In preparation for Washington’s absence, the Jaguars made several roster moves on December 6. Safety Eric Murray was activated from injured reserve, and wide receiver Austin Trammell and defensive back Cam’Ron Silmon-Craig were elevated from the practice squad. Trammell’s elevation comes only days after he moved back to the practice squad, highlighting the coaching staff’s confidence in him as a depth option. Offensive coordinator Liam Coen has already stated that Dyami Brown and Tim Patrick will see expanded roles with Washington out. Today’s matchup holds major playoff implications. Both the Jaguars and Colts enter Week 14 with 8-4 records, tied at the top of the AFC South standings. Jacksonville has momentum, winning three straight games and four of its last five, while Indianapolis enters the contest on a two-game losing streak. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence leads a Jaguars offense averaging 202.8 passing yards per game, while running back Travis Etienne remains the team’s top rusher with 843 yards and five touchdowns. Defensively, the Jaguars rank first in the NFL in rushing yards allowed per game (82.4). While Washington’s absence will be felt, Jacksonville will look to maintain its recent form in a matchup that could help shape the AFC postseason picture. The game is scheduled to kick off at 1 p.m. ET. Also Read: Cowboys news roundup: Key updates on CeeDee Lamb, George Pickens, and more heading into Week 14

Kansas City has beaten Houston in the last five meetings, including in the divisional round of the playoffs in January.","The Athletic has live coverage of NFL Week 14 games.

The final full month of the NFL regular season has arrived, and that means it’s crunch time.

Divisional crowns remain up for grabs, and playoff seeding is far from resolved. Coming up is one of the most hotly contested Decembers in recent memory.

This week’s docket kicked off with Thursday night’s matchup between the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys in which the Lions gave their playoff hopes a jolt and the Cowboys were left with their backs against the wall. The action resumes Sunday with 12 more contests — seven between divisional opponents.

The week concludes with Monday night’s showdown between the Philadelphia Eagles, who aim to rebound from last week’s loss to Dallas and remain in the driver’s seat of the NFC East, and the Los Angeles Chargers, who own an identical 8-4 record and hope to make up some ground on the AFC West-leading Denver Broncos.

Here are five of the most compelling storylines of Week 14.

Battered AFC North brawl

It’s a trying year for AFC North teams. The Pittsburgh Steelers got off to a 4-1 start while the Baltimore Ravens and Cincinnati Bengals battled injuries and the Cleveland Browns’ season quickly spiraled out of control. But the Steelers have since failed to string together consecutive victories, losing five of their last seven, including two straight. The Ravens used a five-game winning streak to save their season and overtake the Steelers for first place, but then got blown out by the Bengals on Thanksgiving. Now, the 6-6 Steelers and Ravens meet Sunday in Baltimore with the division lead up for grabs.

A battered Aaron Rodgers enters this game with intentions of keeping Pittsburgh in the fight. He’ll need some help, however, in the form of improved pass protection from his line, dependability from his pass catchers and some defining stops from his defense — all elements that have proved hard to come by for the Steelers as of late.

Across the way, Lamar Jackson and company aim to rebound from a turnover-plagued outing against Cincinnati. The Ravens’ offense added pressure to a defense that had played much better since the bye week, holding opponents to an average of 13.4 points and forcing two turnovers a game. But the Ravens surrendered 382 yards to Cincinnati, including 261 passing yards and two touchdown passes from Joe Burrow in his return from injury. Pittsburgh’s anemic offense doesn’t pose nearly the same kind of challenge, however, so the Ravens have the opportunity to get back on track defensively. And Jackson and the offense could take advantage of a Steelers defense that entered the week ranked No. 27 against the pass (247.4 yards per game) and No. 17 against the run (117.7 ypg). (Steelers at Ravens, 1 p.m. (ET) Sunday, CBS)

Duel of desperation

Neither Josh Allen nor Burrow anticipated finding themselves in such perilous positions this late in the season. But a 3-2 month caused the Buffalo Bills to drop all the way to the seventh spot in the AFC. And Burrow’s nine-game injury absence and a porous defense have placed the Bengals on the brink of elimination. Now these teams meet in Buffalo, each badly needing a victory to help stabilize its situation.

Catching the idle New England Patriots (winners of 10 straight) for the AFC East title seems challenging, but Buffalo can improve its positioning in the playoff race. Allen remains in need of consistency out of young wide receiver Keon Coleman. A James Cook outing similar to last week’s 32-carry, 144-yard showing against Pittsburgh could also ease pressure on the quarterback. On the surface, Cincinnati’s defense seems like the perfect victim given the Bengals’ last-place rankings in total defense, passing yards and points allowed. However, Cincinnati did turn Jackson and the Ravens over five times last week, and held Derrick Henry to 60 yards and denied Baltimore on seven of 10 third downs. Which unit shows up this week?

Meanwhile, Burrow’s return last week has sparked hope in Cincinnati. He did show some rust, completing only 52 percent of his passes. But he directed third-quarter scoring drives of 61 and 68 yards, and the Bengals snapped a four-game losing streak. In theory, the playoffs remain in reach. It may take winning out and some stumbles by Pittsburgh and Baltimore, but everyone in Cincinnati is highly motivated to do just that. Buffalo’s defense battles inconsistencies, but it is the top unit against the pass, holding foes to 163.2 yards per game and a 59.5 completion percentage. The Bills have surrendered just 12 touchdown passes and have eight interceptions. So, Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase will certainly face stiff competition. (Bengals at Bills, 1 p.m. (ET) Sunday, Fox)

Unlikely AFC South clash

Entering the season, you would’ve been hard-pressed to find any projections that counted the Indianapolis Colts and Jacksonville Jaguars among the contenders in 2025. But both teams enter December very much in the playoff hunt. Indianapolis has led the AFC South for much of the season, but a stumble by the Colts and three-game surge by Jacksonville has now placed the Jaguars in first place, for now. These 8-4 teams meet Sunday in Jacksonville in a game that will give the victor a leg up in the division with four weeks left to go.

After an up-and-down first half of the season, the Jaguars emerged from their bye and have won four of their last five. Jacksonville’s offensive and defensive lines have paved the way for success. On offense, a physical front has led to success in the run game, which has ensured balance while also easing pressure on quarterback Trevor Lawrence. Defensively, the Jaguars have proved stout against the run, which has helped put foes in unfavorable down-and-distance situations and Jacksonville’s pass rushers and defensive backs in prime position for impact plays. The Jaguars have averaged 128.2 rushing yards per game in this 4-1 stretch while holding foes to just 70.2 per contest. A robust defensive effort against the run is a must this week if they aim to derail the Colts and running back Jonathan Taylor, who leads the NFL with 1,282 yards and 15 touchdowns rushing.

Taylor has topped the 100-yard mark five times this season, and has surpassed 120 yards in four of those contests. He also has five multi-touchdown games. Taylor’s production has helped set up Daniel Jones for a year of resurgence. Jones has eclipsed the 3,000-yard mark for only the third time in his career and has 19 touchdown passes (second-most since entering the league in 2019). Jones, however, is playing with a fracture in his fibula, which has limited his mobility and the number of rollouts the Colts used to position him for effectiveness. Jones is coming off two of his worst outings (losses to Kansas City and the Houston Texans) and last week completed just 51.9 percent of his passes, which factored in Indianapolis scoring a season-low 16 points. Can the Jaguars manage to harass the hobbled quarterback similarly to how the Texans did and render one of the league’s top-scoring offenses (29.8 points per game) ineffective? (Colts at Jaguars, 1 p.m. (ET) Sunday, CBS)

Northern rivalry renewed

Once a fierce rivalry, Bears–Packers hasn’t had much juice in recent history. In the last decade, Green Bay has owned Chicago, posting a 17-3 record. During that time, the Packers have reached the playoffs seven times while the Bears have done so just twice. Sunday, however, these familiar foes meet for a game that actually features massive implications. Chicago enters with a 9-3 record and in first place in the NFC North while Green Bay trails with an 8-3-1 record.

There’s a lot riding on this game. A win would give the Bears (winners of five straight and nine of their last 10) their biggest statement yet and a little cushion in the division standings, which they surprisingly lead. A Packers victory, however, would give them an edge entering the final stretch of the season. Green Bay (6 1/2-point favorite) also has a slightly more favorable remaining schedule than Chicago.

Prepare for all kinds of fireworks and an intriguing chess match between two of the brightest offensive minds in the game in Ben Johnson and Matt LaFleur. But these defenses should not be overlooked. Chicago leads the NFL with 26 takeaways while the Packers hold opponents to just 18.8 points per game and boast a disruptive pass rush anchored by Micah Parsons. Green Bay’s defense also ranks among the best against the run (98.3 yards allowed), which could complicate matters for the Bears, whose 153.8 rushing yards per contest lead the NFC and rank second overall. (Bears at Packers, 4:25 p.m. (ET) Sunday, Fox)

Loser leaves town in KC?

When the season kicked off, the Chiefs and Texans were regarded as two of the leading potential contenders in the AFC. Both wound up stumbling out of the gates, however, and quickly lost ground as counterparts passed them by. Now as the fourth quarter of the season begins, each finds itself in dire situations. If the playoffs started today, both Kansas City (6-6) and Houston (7-5) would be on the outside looking in. Because of this, Sunday night’s meeting at Arrowhead Stadium should have a playoff-like atmosphere with the Chiefs and Texans each battling to keep hope alive.

The squads seemingly are trending in opposite directions. Kansas City has lost three of its last four games and is a distant third in the AFC West while Houston has won four straight and stands within striking distance of the Colts and Jaguars.

Despite their struggles, the Chiefs continue to field one of the most efficient offenses, ranking top five in yards, second in total EPA and ninth in points. However, Kansas City has struggled to deliver the explosive plays past iterations were known for, and the Chiefs’ defense — although stingy, holding foes to 19.3 points per game — also has struggled to consistently get off the field in key moments, ranking 25th on third downs. All of that makes for an extremely small margin for error, and during this 1-3 stretch, opponents have outscored the Chiefs 101-91.

Houston, meanwhile, has steadily improved offensively and has done a better job of complementing a fierce defense that has dominated potent offenses like those of Buffalo and Indianapolis. Kansas City has beaten Houston in the last five meetings, including in the divisional round of the playoffs in January. But in a league where the pack seemingly has caught up to the Chiefs, it’s anyone’s guess if Andy Reid and his offense can stay a step ahead of DeMeco Ryans and his defense and preserve Reid’s chances of taking Kansas City to the postseason for an 11th straight year.

This NFL Week 14 injury report includes Jayden Daniels, Mike Evans, and Justin Herbert.

Also included is the SIC Player Edge projection, a proprietary ratings metric you can use when thinking about betting player props or filling out your fantasy football lineups.

Justin Herbert – Hand

Justin Herbert had surgery on Monday to his hand, likely a metacarpal fracture with plates and screws. There’s a high chance he plays with a splint or cast on. He already logged a limited practice today, and it’s the off-hand for the quarterback. He already played through the broken hand finishing the game, and he’s played through a broken left finger before in the past. I expect him to play out of shotgun and not be as mobile to avoid risking ball security, but he will play for the Chargers on Monday Night Football.

Justin Herbert has a -10.8% SIC Player Edge projection which reflects the health of Herbert, the Chargers Pass Offense and the Eagles Pass Defense therefore we expect him to be UNDER his projected passing prop and DFS points.

Jayden Daniels – Elbow

Jayden Daniels. Remember when he dislocated his elbow? Everyone thought, “Oh my gosh, surgery, his season is over,” and we were saying, no, he’s going to make a return quicker than people think. He’s good to go this week and already had a full practice. The only question is whether the Commanders will risk it. They’ve been protective of their star franchise player, but they’re 3–9 and running on fumes for their playoff chances to win the division. It’s likely that Jayden Daniels plays this week.

Jayden Daniels has a -4.6% SIC Player Edge projection which reflects the health of Daniels, the Commanders Pass Offense and the Vikings Pass Defense therefore we expect him to be slightly UNDER his projected passing prop and DFS points.

Marvin Harrison Jr. – Heel

Marvin Harrison has two straight DNPs due to a heel injury coming off an appendectomy. He played pretty well last week. Even though he has not practiced, there is an outside chance that he plays, as wide receivers play on their toes, not their heels.

Marvin Harrison Jr. has a -26.2% SIC Player Edge projection which reflects the health of Harrison, the Cardinals Pass Offense and the Rams Pass Defense therefore we expect him to be UNDER his projected passing prop and DFS points.

Mike Evans – Collarbone

Mike Evans’ injury was more recent, but he should return more quickly. Both have logged limited practices so far this week. Mike Evans has just a clavicle fracture; it’s been six-plus weeks, he’s ready to go, and he’s been working out lower body with no problems. There’s still a chance he could be activated and play this week.

Jayden Reed – Collarbone

Jayden Reed will likely have a slightly slower recovery. Yes, his collarbone fracture was earlier this season than Mike Evans’, but remember, he had the fifth metatarsal Jones-type fracture with surgery, and that is likely the rate-limiting step for his return for the Packers.

Mayfield was fined $14,491, while Irving was left $6,349 lighter in the wallet.

NFL vice president Troy Vincent previously stated that the gesture would be fined as a ""violent gesture"" in 2025 due to its ""gang connotations."" He said that the NFL wanted to kill the gesture and that other players don't like it either.

“We’re focusing on a small fraction (of players), but sportsmanship is important... When you see it, you’ve got to kill it. You’ve got to stop it immediately. Most players don’t want it in the game either.”

State of the Bucs

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have been going through a bit of a rough patch lately. Despite starting the season 6-2, they've fallen to 7-5 after suffering a three-game losing streak in November. They weren't even that competitive in several of their losses.

The losses have allowed the rival Carolina Panthers to draw even with them at seven wins apiece and the two sides face each other twice in the final three weeks of the season.

Needless to say, it would behoove Mayfield and the Bucs to start playing a little more like the Super Bowl contender they think they are, and fast.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_spun_articles_751/ed3c821d406113cbc05989f42bd97bd1,N,,2025-12-07 11:05:55.920676

He also took sole possession of second place for most consecutive games with at least five receptions by a tight end.
With Tip Reiman out for the season, their best blocking tight end, the Cardinals haven't ran 13 personnel nearly as often.
Instead, the Cardinals have used lineman like Josh Fryar and Kelvin Beachum as the ""muscle hat"" tight end.
""I want to win every single game and what we work to do is to win every single game,"" McBride said.","Trey McBride knew the question about his historic stretch was coming, yet he couldn't care less.

Last weekend, McBride passed Jimmy Graham for most receptions by a tight end in his first four seasons. He also took sole possession of second place for most consecutive games with at least five receptions by a tight end. McBride can tie Travis Kelce's 15 straight games on Sunday at State Farm Stadium against the Rams.

""Right now, I'm just kind of going through it and trying to do my job to the best my ability and try to win some football games,"" McBride said. ""Honestly, that stuff doesn't really do it for me. I don't really care either way. I think it's great that I'm doing it, but I just try to do my job and win some football games. That's what I care about right now.""

When McBride's playing career comes to an end, that'll likely be the time when he can appreciate those accomplishments, but that won't be for a long time. In the meantime, he's climbing up the rankings.

""I would have never guessed it,"" McBride said. ""I've been successful the last couple of years, but I credit that to the O-Line, to the coaches, to the quarterbacks who give me the ball.""

As of Monday, McBride led all tight ends in Pro Bowl votes.

But it's the reality of the loss from Sunday against the Buccaneers that continued to eat at him 24 hours later. He specifically mentioned the fourth-and-1 run the Cardinals couldn't convert early in the fourth quarter, a play in which McBride disengaged from his block much too early.

""That's a big play that's really eating at me,"" McBride said. ""I could've strained a little bit harder. I could've been better in that plan. That's really tearing me up.""

McBride isn't an all-world blocking tight end, not yet at least. It's an area of his game that he has repeatedly said he has wanted to improve. With Tip Reiman out for the season, their best blocking tight end, the Cardinals haven't ran 13 personnel nearly as often.

Instead, the Cardinals have used lineman like Josh Fryar and Kelvin Beachum as the ""muscle hat"" tight end.

However, the Cardinals offense is centered around McBride's ability to make a play with the ball in his hand.

""I think every week I find something new that I admire about his game and him as a person,"" quarterback Jacoby Brissett said. ""His ability to play through a bunch of 'BS' -- he's not getting any (penalty) calls and not that you cry for calls. Then I go back (through the film) and he was even more open than I thought he was -- it is just stuff like that.""

Brissett mentioned there was a moment when a player on the Buccaneers recognized that McBride was preparing to run a seam route and asked the safety for help in stopping him.

It did not work.

""His ability to just want the ball, want to be successful and want to win,"" Brissett said. ""I remember my college coach always said (that) when you turn the film on, you want to make sure somebody can tell that you want to win. I think that's very evident. When you turn a film on, watch Trey.""

Earlier in the week, McBride went viral for the selections he made for his NFL Mount Rushmore of tight ends.

Playing at this rate, McBride will land on the Mount Rushmore of many other people.

That's fine. But he's prefer talking about playing during victories.

""I want to win every single game and what we work to do is to win every single game,"" McBride said. ""The one score games, the losses, it's tough. We're right there.

PHILADELPHIA − The Eagles know they won't have star right tackle Lane Johnson and star defensive tackle Jalen Carter.

Both have been ruled out of the Eagles' Dec. 8 game against the Los Angeles Chargers with injuries. Johnson is missing his third straight game with a foot injury, while Carter will likely miss a few games after a non-surgical procedure, according to a source, on both of his shoulders.

What the Eagles don't know is the Chargers' quarterback.

Buy Philadelphia Eagles tickets

That's because QB Justin Herbert is listed as questionable on the Chargers' injury report after having surgery on his left (non-throwing) hand earlier this week. Herbert broke the hand on Nov. 30 against the Raiders.

He left the game to get it wrapped, then returned in the Chargers' 31-14 win.

Herbert was clearly limited upon returning, although he did go 15-for-20 for 151 yard with 2 touchdown passes and an interceptions. When Herbert returned to the game, he took all snaps in the shotgun formation to minimize the impact on his hand.

And it's possible that could be the case again if he plays.

If Herbert doesn't play, the Chargers will go with backup Trey Lance, the No. 3 overall pick of the San Francisco 49ers in 2021 who has never lived up to expectations. Lance has never thrown more than 71 passes in a season, and that was as a rookie.

The Eagles, of course, are preparing for both quarterbacks. But they offer different styles. Herbert is one of the more prolific passers since entering the NFL in 2020 as Los Angeles' first-round pick, No. 6 overall.

But he's also adept as a runner and in the play-action pass game. Herbert has rushed for a career-high 353 yards this season, more than Eagles' QB Jalen Hurts, who has 329. Lance isn't nearly as accurate of a passer, although he can make plays with his feet. His career completion percentage is 56.4.

It's likely that Herbert won't run much, if at all, if he plays however.

""You always have to go through every situation that could possibly happen,"" Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said on Dec. 6. ""And yeah, we will prepare for both.""

Celebrate the Eagles Super Bowl win with our new book

Eagles defensive tackle Moro Ojomo said if Herbert does play, it will be different.

""It changes up the run dynamic, the way he has to hold the ball,"" Ojomo said, adding that Herbert likely won't be using his left hand to hand the ball off. ""And anything that helps us get an extra second. So I think him having to hold the ball differently probably makes him hold it a little bit (longer), and that’s to our advantage, I hope.""

One thing that won't be to the Eagles' advantage is the likely return of running back Omarion Hampton, the Chargers' first-round pick last spring. Hampton hasn't played since Oct. 5. Hampton had 414 yards rushing in the first five games.

Hampton is listed as questionable, but he has been a full participant in practice.

Since he has been out, Kimani Vidal has taken up much of the slack. Vidal had 126 rushing yards against the Raiders and 532 overall. For the first time, the Chargers should have a solid 1-2 punch at running back.

That was a problem for the Eagles in their last game, as they allowed 281 rushing yards to the Bears' duo of D'Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai in their 24-15 loss.

And that was with Carter playing.

""They do,"" have a good running game, Eagles defensive coordinator Vic Fangio said. ""They've rushed for 200 yards on two teams this year ... They have a big tight end, big fullback, pretty big O-line, good backs. They run it very, very well.""","https://www.delawareonline.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/03/PWIL/87592763007-justin-herbert.jpg?crop=3599,2025,x0,y120&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-07 06:01:02.683208

A pair of second-year quarterbacks are returning to face one another, as both the Commanders' Jayden Daniels and the Vikings' J.J. McCarthy will be active.

However, a pair of second-year wide receivers in the Bears' Rome Odunze and the Cardinals' Marvin Harrison Jr. are both dealing with injuries that will keep them out of action.

See who's in and who's out for Week 14:

QB Jayden Daniels (Commanders)

Practice schedule: Limited-Full-Full

Injury: Left elbow

Daniels will be active for the Commanders' Week 14 game against the Vikings. He missed the past four games after dislocating his left elbow in Week 9 against the Seahawks. After winning Rookie of the Year in 2024, Daniels hasn't had an enjoyable 2025 season. He has been active for just six games and completed just 62.5% of his passing attempts in those games. While Washington (3-9) is out of the NFC playoff race, Daniels can build some momentum for the following season in these final weeks.

QB J.J. McCarthy (Vikings)

Practice schedule: Full-Full-Full

Injury: Concussion

McCarthy progressed through the concussion protocol and will be active for the Vikings game against the Commanders. After a one-game absence, McCarthy slots back into a spot where he must perform. Through six games this season, he's completed just 54.1% of his passes and has a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 6-to-10.

QB Lamar Jackson (Ravens)

Practice schedule: Limited-DNP-Full

Injury: Ankle

Jackson will be available for the Ravens' Week 14 game against the Steelers. While he's healthy enough to play, Jackson hasn't recorded an entire week of full practices since returning from a hamstring injury four weeks ago. He hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in any of the last three games, but will look to find the end zone in a matchup that will leave either Baltimore or Pittsburgh alone atop the AFC North.

QB Aaron Rodgers (Steelers)

Practice schedule: DNP-Full-Full

Injury: Wrist

Rodgers will be active for the Steelers game against the Ravens. It's the second week in a row that he'll attempt to play through a fractured left wrist. The Steelers' passing game has floundered recently as they haven't completed a pass of over 20 air yards since Week 8. Moreso, Pittsburgh is in danger of enduring its first losing season in 19 years under head coach Mike Tomlin, but a win Sunday could restore their place atop the AFC North.

WR Rome Odunze (Bears)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Foot

Odunze will be inactive for the first time this season on Sunday when the Bears face the Packers. After scoring a touchdown in each of Chicago's first four games, he has only found the end zone once in the last eight weeks. Still, Odunze's absence is a significant one in a game where the Bears can increase their lead in the NFC North. Veteran WR D.J. Moore will have a chance to re-establish himself, and rookie WR Luther Burden II can make a name for himself with Odunze out.

WR Jayden Reed (Packers)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Foot/Shoulder

Reed will be active for the Packers game against the Bears. He has missed the past 11 games after sustaining a collarbone injury in Green Bay's season opener. With him returning, it offers a new wrinkle to this Packers' offense that simply wasn't there without him and his speed.

WR Mike Evans (Buccaneers)

Practice schedule: Limited-Limited-Limited

Injury: Collarbone

Evans will miss the Buccaneers' Week 14 game against the Saints, making it his fifth absence in a row. Evans sustained a collarbone injury in Week 7 against the Lions that landed him on injured reserve. He had his 21-day practice window opened this week, and was able to get on the field in practice, but is not healthy enough to return. Evans' return is imminent and the future Hall of Famer will have a chance to help Tampa Bay secure the NFC South and make a playoff run.

RB Kyren Williams (Rams)

Practice schedule: Limited-Full-Full

Injury: Ankle

Williams will be active for the Rams' Week 14 game against the Cardinals. He sustained an ankle injury midway through Los Angeles' game against Carolina last week, but returned to action. While the injury limited his participation on Wednesday, it won't affect his availability. That said, the Rams may opt to give backup RB Blake Corum more of an opportunity.

WR Marvin Harrison Jr. (Cardinals)

Practice schedule: DNP-DNP-DNP

Injury: Heel

Harrison will miss the Cardinals game againt the Rams. After returning from a two-game absence due to appendicitis, Harrison will miss another contest because of a heel injury. He sustained the injury midway through the Cardinals' game against the Buccaneers last week. His absence vaults WR Michael Wilson back into a primary role.

Let’s take a look at who has an injury designation for both sides heading into this weekend’s game.

Wagner was a DNP on both Wednesday and Thursday before returning to practice in a limited capacity on Friday. I’m assuming he’ll be a game-time decision but I’d be pretty shocked if he didn’t play. Brown was a full participant on both Wednesday and Thursday before not practicing at all on Friday in what appears to have been a rest day. It’s possible he may have aggravated something in practice, but I suppose we’ll find out when the inactive lists come out on Sunday morning. The big story for Washington, of course, is the return of quarterback Jayden Daniels, who was fully cleared and will start for the first time since injuring his non-throwing elbow in Week 9

If the Vikings want to bring Chandler back, they’ll need to add him to the 53-man roster and make a corresponding move on Saturday. Otherwise, he’ll continue to not count against the roster as he makes his return from IR. Darrisaw had his usual full practice/day off/full practice regimen from most of this season, while Jackson didn’t practice at all on Wednesday and was limited in both Thursday and Friday’s sessions. My guess is that he will also be a game-time decision.

This NFL Week 14 injury report includes Jayden Daniels, Mike Evans, and Justin Herbert.

Also included is the SIC Player Edge projection, a proprietary ratings metric you can use when thinking about betting player props or filling out your fantasy football lineups.

Justin Herbert – Hand

Justin Herbert had surgery on Monday to his hand, likely a metacarpal fracture with plates and screws. There’s a high chance he plays with a splint or cast on. He already logged a limited practice today, and it’s the off-hand for the quarterback. He already played through the broken hand finishing the game, and he’s played through a broken left finger before in the past. I expect him to play out of shotgun and not be as mobile to avoid risking ball security, but he will play for the Chargers on Monday Night Football.

Justin Herbert has a -10.8% SIC Player Edge projection which reflects the health of Herbert, the Chargers Pass Offense and the Eagles Pass Defense therefore we expect him to be UNDER his projected passing prop and DFS points.

Jayden Daniels – Elbow

Jayden Daniels. Remember when he dislocated his elbow? Everyone thought, “Oh my gosh, surgery, his season is over,” and we were saying, no, he’s going to make a return quicker than people think. He’s good to go this week and already had a full practice. The only question is whether the Commanders will risk it. They’ve been protective of their star franchise player, but they’re 3–9 and running on fumes for their playoff chances to win the division. It’s likely that Jayden Daniels plays this week.

Jayden Daniels has a -4.6% SIC Player Edge projection which reflects the health of Daniels, the Commanders Pass Offense and the Vikings Pass Defense therefore we expect him to be slightly UNDER his projected passing prop and DFS points.

Marvin Harrison Jr. – Heel

Marvin Harrison has two straight DNPs due to a heel injury coming off an appendectomy. He played pretty well last week. Even though he has not practiced, there is an outside chance that he plays, as wide receivers play on their toes, not their heels.

Marvin Harrison Jr. has a -26.2% SIC Player Edge projection which reflects the health of Harrison, the Cardinals Pass Offense and the Rams Pass Defense therefore we expect him to be UNDER his projected passing prop and DFS points.

Mike Evans – Collarbone

Mike Evans’ injury was more recent, but he should return more quickly. Both have logged limited practices so far this week. Mike Evans has just a clavicle fracture; it’s been six-plus weeks, he’s ready to go, and he’s been working out lower body with no problems. There’s still a chance he could be activated and play this week.

Jayden Reed – Collarbone

Jayden Reed will likely have a slightly slower recovery. Yes, his collarbone fracture was earlier this season than Mike Evans’, but remember, he had the fifth metatarsal Jones-type fracture with surgery, and that is likely the rate-limiting step for his return for the Packers.

Despite missing the 2025 NFL season due to injury, the Browns are not planning to move on from quarterback Deshaun Watson in 2026, per multiple reports. The former first-round pick hasn't suited up for the Browns since Week 7 of the 2024 season, in a 21-14 loss to divisional foe Cincinnati.

Cleveland opened Watson's 21-day practice window this week, more than a full year after the quarterback first ruptured his right Achilles tendon against the Bengals.

""His focus, my focus is obviously getting him back to playing football, practicing football, which he hasn’t done in over a year. Good next step for him,” head coach Kevin Stefanski said during his press conference Wednesday.

The Browns may have opened Watson's window to get a better idea of where he is in his recovery from multiple ruptures to that Achilles tendon, a person familiar with Watson’s situation told USA TODAY Sports.

Stefanski didn't say that this move came with the idea that Watson would play in 2025.

“His focus is putting a helmet on again for the first time, shoulder pads, throwing a football,"" Stefanski said. ""That’s where the focus is.”

That decision makes the move to keep Watson on the roster clearer. Cleveland's relied on rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders at quarterback this season after trading away veteran Joe Flacco.

Stefanski praised Watson's impact on the rookies.

“He’s been so supportive in the meeting room, on the game field with the players,” said Stefanski. “I know he’s excited to get back out there practicing with his teammates.”

Gabriel and Sanders will both likely be on the team next year and could compete with at least Watson for the starting job should the team not draft another quarterback, per reports. The team restructured Watson's contract last December in a move to spread out the cap hits on his current deal. Keeping him on the roster even if he doesn't start would be more prudent as cutting him before June 1, 2026 would incur a $130 million dead cap hit.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/07/USAT/87649867007-usatsi-27666876.jpg?crop=7671,4316,x0,y399&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-07 01:59:47.997955

Herbert is officially questionable to play following a week of limited participation in practice, during which head coach Jim Harbaugh repeatedly echoed the team's confidence that Herbert will be healthy enough to go just one week after undergoing surgery on his fractured left hand and eight days after sustaining the injury in a win over the Raiders.

That remains to be seen. If Herbert sits, Trey Lance would be in line for his first start as a Charger at a potential inflection point of the season.

The Chargers are currently in playoff position at 8-4, but they're dealing with a crowded AFC postseason picture that includes the Jaguars (8-4), Colts (8-4), Bills (8-4), Texans (7-5), Ravens (6-6), Steelers (6-6) and Chiefs (6-6) either matching their win total or hovering just a few games behind.

Herbert has led Los Angeles to the No. 5 seed thus far, throwing for 2,842 yards with a 66.9 completion percentage, 21 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He's also given defenses trouble on the ground, having scored once and already amassed a career-high 353 rushing, though he might be less prone to take off if he ends up facing Philadelphia given the injury.

Lance, meanwhile, has gone from the 49ers' presumed QB of the future when drafted by them in the 2021 first round to castoff with the Cowboys in 2024 before catching on with L.A. ahead of this season and beating out Taylor Heinicke for the QB2 role behind Herbert.

He has a 2-3 career record with 1,153 passing yards, five touchdowns and four interceptions. He's thrown for 90 yards on 7-of-13 passing across three brief appearances in relief of Herbert in 2025.

Even if Herbert does play, it'll be interesting to see if there are any packages -- especially on the goal line -- that call for Lance to enter the game temporarily. Herbert operated exclusively out of pistol and shotgun following his injury last week and will likely continue to do so.

Either to help Lance ease in should he be called on to start or limit chances for Herbert to take big hits, the Chargers might also employ a run-heavy approach against the Eagles, who are coming off a loss to the Bears in which they were gashed for 281 rushing yards.

Such a game plan would fall on the shoulders of Kimani Vidal and Omarion Hampton, who's questionable to return from an ankle injury for the first time since Week 5 but seemingly trending the right direction with two straight practices.

However the Chargers find a way to exploit the Eagles, it will be vitally important; Week 14 begins a stretch of five straight games against teams .500 or better to conclude the regular season.

Sherfield was signed as an undrafted free agent and was with the Cardinals for three seasons (2018-20). Since then, Sherfield has spent time with the San Francisco 49ers, Miami Dolphins, Buffalo Bills, Minnesota Vikings and Denver Broncos.

The Cardinals signed Sherfield to the practice squad on Nov. 19. He has played in 122 games across eight seasons, catching 89 passes for 1,034 yards and six touchdowns.

Drafted by Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round in 2023, Brooks appeared in 21 games with the Cowboys in two seasons (2023-24) and caught 18 passes for 241 yards and a touchdown.

Tindall has previously played in two games for the Cardinals this season. He has appeared in 46 games in four NFL seasons with the Cardinals and Dolphins (2022-24) and has registered 18 tackles.

But Watson starting in 2026 for Cleveland while a young quarterback gets ready could be in play.","Deshaun Watson returned to the practice field on Wednesday for the first time this season when the Cleveland Browns opened the 21-day practice window for their former starting quarterback.

While sources say it's considered unlikely that Watson would start a game for the Browns this season, his return to the field for Cleveland in 2026 as a potential starter is more likely than not. It would be a surprise at this point if Watson, who is due $46 million guaranteed next season, was not on the Cleveland roster to begin training camp in 2026.

Watson, 30, currently is recovering from his second Achilles tear -- the latest significant injury in a stint in Cleveland that has not gone how either party anticipated.

Watson first tore his Achilles in Week 7 of the 2024 season. He then re-ruptured the tendon and underwent surgery on Jan. 9. Watson's previous 2023 season ended after six games when he underwent surgery to repair a fractured throwing shoulder.

The Browns signaled they were moving in a different direction at QB when they drafted Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders in April, selections that came a month after Cleveland owner Jimmy Haslam conceded the franchise ""took a big swing and miss with Deshaun.""

As Cleveland seeks answers at the QB position -- Sanders is set to make his third start of the season on Sunday against the Titans -- it's hard to imagine the Browns would put Watson on the field after nine or so practices in December considering he did not participate in training camp and has not played since Oct. 2024.

Could Watson be activated to the 53-man active roster off the PUP list in the role of backup in the event of an injury to a QB already on the roster? It's possible. But Watson starting is unlikely.

Instead, Watson is expected to use his practice time to get back into football shape and reacclimate himself.

Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski largely avoided the topic of when Watson could play again when he talked with reporters this past week, but he has praised Watson's efforts to return.

""He has been working so hard, rehabbing, so finally to get out there on the practice field with his teammates to go through individual, I think this is really great for him,"" Stefanski said on Wednesday when Watson was designated to return. ""His focus, my focus is obviously getting him back to playing football, practicing football, which he hasn't done in over a year.""

Sources say Watson has not been a distraction in the building while rehabbing this year.

Watson signed a five-year, $230 million fully guaranteed contract with the the Browns in 2022 when he was traded to Cleveland from the Houston Texans after he sat out the 2021 season amid a trade request.

Watson then served an 11-game suspension at the beginning of the 2022 season for violating the personal-conduct policy following more than 20 allegations of sexual misconduct during massage sessions.

Watson's play since arriving in Cleveland has not matched his performance in Houston where he made three consecutive Pro Bowls from 2018 to 2020. Watson has appeared in just 19 games for the Browns with a 9-10 record, throwing 19 touchdowns to 12 interceptions.

While Cleveland could move on from him, a release this offseason would carry a massive salary-cap hit. They also might still need an experienced bridge starter for 2026 if the Browns, holders of two first-round picks, decide to draft a quarterback early and determine Sanders and Gabriel aren't in their future plans.

Of course, a trade always is possible for the right price. The league has seen crazier things.

This column is coming out on December 6th and mostly being read on the 7th, and my brain immediately goes to “6-7.” Blame the little boy who sat behind me in church recently. The priest said, “Open to hymn 678,” and before anyone could open a hymnbook, this very well-behaved boy blurted out, “Six … seven …”

His dad shot him a look and muttered, “Jesus Christ.”

In church!

It’s not the kid’s fault. The trend is everywhere, and apparently it’s immortal, harder to avoid than a Jerry Jones radio interview.

Another trend I truly cannot figure out?

Drake “Drake Maye” Maye. That’s the New England Patriots quarterback’s nickname, to the confusion of almost anyone who’s not obsessively online, including Maye’s teammate, Kayshon Boutte.

But if you’re worried this is just about the stage of life I’m in, I do remember the 21st night of September.

That was the last time the Patriots lost a football game. It came against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and everything for New England (and Pittsburgh!) has looked different since. Who saw that coming?

And here’s something else I do know: Mike Vrabel and Ben Johnson were the names every owner wanted last offseason. Now? Those two have their new teams leading their conferences, and one of them will probably win NFL Coach of the Year. (I have a vote. I’m undecided. Still plenty of time.)

The Patriots are on their bye, but Bears-Packers? This is the biggest game those two franchises have played since the end of the 2013 regular season. The NFL’s oldest rivalry is back and actually meaningful.

And that’s just one of three games this week featuring two teams with at least eight wins. My football family, Week 14 is a monster.

Here’s what I’m hearing about:

Lost Vegas

From dorm room to division race

Coaching contenders

Postgame speeches

Slay’s situation

Kyler’s future, Herbert’s status and record watch

A reset on the reset

This was supposed to be the Tom Brady turnaround in Las Vegas: the greatest quarterback of all time stepping in and shaping an aimless organization, with a blueprint straight from the mountaintop of champions.

“I really don’t know what the plan is. I don’t think anyone knows,” one Raider said this week when asked if he felt good about the future of the team. At 2-10, the Raiders sit at the bottom of their division again.

So much was said about what Brady would actually be doing as a minority owner, and I can tell you that teams around the league were watching nervously, worried the Raiders might get the full benefit of the “Brady Way.” The first sign of that new order? The arrival of Alex Guerrero. Yes, that Alex Guerrero — Brady’s longtime trainer and business partner. Guerrero, the Raiders’ wellness coordinator, isn’t just a confidant; he’s the minority owner’s eyes and ears in the building when Brady is working for Fox or back in Florida with his kids.

Brady hasn’t been in the facility more than a handful of times this season, but he is involved every day, communicating with Guerrero, owner Mark Davis, GM John Spytek, coaches and players.

Inside the building, people believed Brady would lure the hottest coaching candidates on the market, like Johnson or Vrabel — names every owner coveted last offseason. They landed instead on 74-year-old Pete Carroll, who brought along his sons Nate and Brennan, both offensive assistants.

Players thought Brady would deliver Matthew Stafford after a long ski-slope conversation last offseason.

He missed.

Then Brady shot down Sam Darnold as an option.

Another miss.

Brady pushed for offensive coordinator Chip Kelly to inject pace and creativity into the team’s play calling. They made him the highest-paid offensive coordinator in football. He’s no longer with the team. The rookie class isn’t carrying its weight. Nothing has landed the way it was sold.

So what exactly are the Raiders building?

That’s the question bouncing around the facility and being whispered across the league. And the people who’ve lived it aren’t sugarcoating a thing. Former Raiders head coach Antonio Pierce, who felt the churn from the inside, unloaded on national TV with a level of honesty you almost never hear from a former coach:

“They might need decades to fix this bad boy. I’m just saying,” Pierce said. “One and done, one and done, one and done … is there another coach gone? Another coordinator? Listen, there’s gonna be something I talk about a little later where everybody’s pointing fingers. But at some point, point there and the thumb points back.”

One current Raiders staffer texted me: “It’s hard to argue with him.”

And the numbers don’t lie. Since Mark Davis took over in 2011, the Raiders have cycled through seven full-time head coaches, tied with the Jacksonville Jaguars for the most in the NFL. They are one of four teams since then without a playoff win, and they have the league’s worst point differential over that stretch.

Many around the league — and even some inside the building — are wondering if Carroll will survive this season. If the Raiders do move on from him, this isn’t a reset. It’s a reset on the reset. Tom Brady, the player, needed a little time to learn the job. Tom Brady, the owner, may require the same grace.

The Duke guys keeping Daniel Jones protected

When Daniel Jones started taking first-team reps as a sophomore at Duke, his teammates gave him a nickname.

“The Future.” (Much better than Danny Dimes, right?)

With Jones now playing professionally for Indianapolis, where he’s steadied the franchise, that nickname is starting to feel familiar. And here he is, trying to play through a fractured fibula for the third straight week, this time against the Jaguars, who are tied with the Colts atop the AFC South.

To do it, Jones will again be wearing a custom hybrid thigh pad/shin guard on his left leg. And those Duke teammates who once christened him “The Future?”

They’re the ones who built it.

About three weeks ago, when the Colts discovered the crack in Jones’ leg, athletic trainer Stephen Galvan called Kevin Gehsmann, CEO of Protect3D, the North Carolina startup that builds custom 3D-printed braces and orthotics. Gehsmann also happens to be Jones’ former Duke teammate and senior-year roommate.

Jones hopped on FaceTime with his old friend from the Indianapolis training room while the Colts used an app to scan his leg. The image traveled from Indy to Durham, where Protect3D printed the brace in under 48 hours.

Since it was a late-week order, delivery required a hand-delivered drop-off in Kansas City the night before the Colts’ Week 12 matchup against the Chiefs. Jones made sure his old roommate got tickets to the game.

“Before the game, I had breakfast with his parents and brother and then sat with his brother, who was there with a couple of Duke basketball guys. We had a good time,” Gehsmann told me over the phone Friday morning while headed to work.

Jones’ injury isn’t so much about severe pain, but rather about the stability of the quarterback’s leg, meaning that in a sport that emphasizes “get-off” speed, it’s been harder for him to fully push off. Jones, whose well-earned reputation for toughness was known even during his New York Giants days, loves the feel of his new leg pad. And the Colts need this to be successful; they’ve lost three of four games and are drifting down in the standings.

Gehsmann, a former linebacker, and fellow Blue Devils football alum Clark Bulleit, both engineering majors, first helped Jones with their tech when he was dealing with a collarbone injury in 2018.

Since then, the company has grown from a garage-and-engineering-lab experiment to an operation that outfits athletes across the NBA, MLS and even WWE, with most employees being former college athletes with engineering or medical degrees.

“This was a full-circle moment to help Daniel again, and we went out of our way to do everything we could,” said Gehsmann, who has continued to check in with Jones to make sure the pad is working out.

And yes, for the record: Jones was a relatively clean roommate … by college football standards, anyway.

Prove-it time for coaching candidates

Expect these assistant coaches to garner serious looks in the upcoming coaching cycle: Chiefs OC Matt Nagy, 49ers DC Robert Saleh, Colts DC Lou Anarumo, Broncos DC Vance Joseph, Dolphins DC Anthony Weaver, Seahawks OC Klint Kubiak, Rams DC Chris Shula, Commanders OC Kliff Kingsbury, Packers DC Jeff Hafley, Bills OC Joe Brady and Jags DC Anthony Campanile.

Since 2011, at least five head-coaching vacancies have popped up each cycle. Right now? Only two teams have openings: the Giants and Titans. That number will go up. There are no guarantees these jobs will come open, but many around the league are asking questions about the Atlanta Falcons, Cleveland Browns, Arizona Cardinals and Cincinnati Bengals, in addition to the Raiders.

Coaches have about a month left, maybe through the playoffs, to prove they can handle the big seat.

Bonus coach coverage

Those candidates interviewing for head coaching jobs should have to audition with their postgame locker room speeches. I touched on team sayings and slogans in my last column, but it got me thinking: How much are coaches actually thinking about these speeches, the ones plastered all over the internet after every win? New York Jets coach Aaron Glenn? Really good. “Who wants to fly with the f—– Jets.” Dan Campbell? I’ll run through a wall for ya’ from my kitchen!

But the undisputed champion of locker room celebrations? Ben Johnson, with or without his shirt.

One head coach told me he even finds himself thinking about his potential postgame messaging on the drive to the game. “Honestly, I never really thought this much about it, but now with all the cameras, it’s no longer a private moment with my team. It’s for the world, and I feel like it’s getting competitive!”

A sloppy situation in Buffalo

What’s Buffalo Bills GM Brandon Beane going to do? His team claimed cornerback Darius Slay after he was waived by the Steelers, but the veteran then said he would not report to Buffalo as he considered retirement.

The Bills retain Slay’s playing rights after he was placed on the reserve/retired list. As of now, his future remains uncertain.

In late February, while still under contract with the Philadelphia Eagles, Slay appeared on the “St. Brown Podcast” and said that he wanted to play one more year and that “the two spots I would love to always be at is Philly or Detroit.”

Less than a month later, Philadelphia released him and Pittsburgh quickly signed him. For now, I’m told that Slay will remain on the sidelines. With the Bills facing the Eagles in Week 17, it will be interesting to see what Buffalo decides to do. Slay is repped by superagent Drew Rosenhaus, so Buffalo may want to play nice.

Before you go

• It wouldn’t surprise a lot of league executives if the Cardinals decide to move on from 28-year-old Kyler Murray after this season. His contract complicates things because he’s still owed $36.8 million in fully guaranteed salary and bonuses for 2026. But even before his current foot injury, things weren’t clicking. The Cardinals could try to trade him or simply release him. Either way, after coach Jonathan Gannon said Murray is done for the season, the sense is change is coming in the desert.

• The Eagles are trying to shake off that ugly Black Friday loss to the Bears. I’m told this week, the team had a series of “no-BS discussions” ahead of a “Monday Night Football” meeting with the Los Angeles Chargers. The message? Stop pointing fingers. “We are all done with the finger-pointing,” one Philly player told me. “It’s not just one thing that’s in our way. It’s not just Jalen (Hurts), it’s not just Saquon (Barkley), it’s not just (OC Kevin) Patullo, it’s not just the offensive line. … It’s a little bit of everyone.”

• Speaking of the Chargers, I’m told QB Justin Herbert is trying to play despite undergoing surgery to repair a fractured left hand on Monday. Given his track record of playing through injuries, it would not be surprising. Players I spoke to on the Chargers are expecting him to go.

• A battered Chiefs offensive line already without rookie left tackle Josh Simmons (who was placed on IR earlier this week) is expected to also be missing RG Trey Smith (ankle) and RT Jawaan Taylor (triceps, knee) when they face the Houston Texans on Sunday.

• The Denver Broncos are the first team since the 1986 Giants to win four straight games by 3 points or less. I’m sure Sean Payton sent that stat to Bill Parcells, the coach of the Super Bowl XXI champions and Payton’s mentor. Those Giants finished that season 14-2 and beat, you guessed it … Denver in the Super Bowl.

• Cleveland’s Myles Garrett is 3.5 sacks shy of the single-season record, jointly held by Michael Strahan (2001) and T.J. Watt (2021). His next opponent? Titans rookie Cam Ward, who has taken more sacks than any other quarterback in the league (48). Keep in mind, Garrett already has two games this season in which he registered four-plus sacks.

• Finally, you might recall NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth raising some eyebrows with his distinctive pronunciation of Washington’s backup quarterback’s name last week. Turns out, he had it right.

“Mar-ee-o-ta,” Marcus Mariota told reporters this week, with a well-enunciated T. “I think it’s been said over the years like Mary-ota, which is incorrect. It’s pronounced Mar-ee-o-ta.”

But don’t feel bad if you’ve been saying it wrong. I got a text message this week from a loyal reader who happily told me he listens to WFAN, where hosts say they won’t believe NFL rumors “until I hear it from Diana Russini.”

Like many of you, this reader spelled my first name incorrectly. Unlike many of you, this reader was my father. Thanks for reading, Dad, and as always, thanks for spelling my name this way because you wanted me to be different.

Out: DT Jalen Carter (shoulders), RT Lane Johnson (foot)

Questionable: S Marcus Epps (shoulder), OT Myles Hinton (back)

The Chargers, meanwhile, have listed starting quarterback Justin Herbert (non-throwing hand) as questionable. Herbert had surgery on that left hand earlier in the week. While reports out of LA suggest Herbert will play, Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni said they have been preparing for either quarterback. The Chargers’ backup is Trey Lance.

NFL

Both Epps and Hinton (listed as questionable) are still on IR but have been practicing after having their practice windows opened. It’s expected that Epps will be activated and all signs are pointing toward him starting against the Chargers.

The three players who were limited on Thursday — Jaelan Phillips (concussion), Zack Baun (hand) and Jahan Dotson (toe) — were all full participants on Friday and are good to go. Phillips has cleared the NFL’s concussion protocol.

Landon Dickerson returned to practice on Saturday as a full participant after getting a rest day on Friday. Dickerson, 27, has battled through several different injuries this season and has started 11 of 12 games.

“I think he's done a really nice job,” Sirianni said on Saturday. “Landon's so powerful of being able to move people off the spot. He’s so critical for our offense to be able to help identify defenses and different things like that. And so I think he's had a lot of good moments in the season and has played good football. Obviously as an entire offense, we want us all to be more consistent as coaches and players, so there's going to be plays everybody wants back, but Landon's done a nice job.”

Defensive end Tyquan Lewis has been downgraded to out. Kicker Blake Grupe and defensive tackle Chris Wormley have been elevated from the practice squad.

Carlies suffered an ankle injury that sidelined him in late-summer following the Colts' preseason opener against Baltimore, holding back a player who was expected to take over a starting role after the team let E.J. Speed leave in free agency. Carlies was placed on IR in late-August and initially wasn't expected to miss much more than the requisite four weeks, but the organization only opened his 21-day practice window on Nov. 19 ahead of the team's Week 12 clash with the Chiefs.

The team was required to activate Carlies by this weekend's game, or he would be sidelined for the rest of the season. He was a full participant in all nine practices or walk-throughs he's participated in since his 21-day window opened up.

In the wake of his injury, the Colts signed veteran linebacker Germaine Pratt in October following Pratt's release from the Raiders and Indianapolis cycling through a slew of replacement options at the weakside linebacker position. It's not immediately clear what role -- or how much of one -- Carlies will play in his return.

The injury-plagued fifth-round pick out of Missouri missed seven games as a rookie with a broken fibula before undergoing shoulder surgery in the offseason, forcing him to miss the entire spring installation of new defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo's scheme.

The former safety has shown a particular strength in coverage when he's been on the field, following a college career as a safety before transitioning to linebacker as an NFL rookie a year ago. Carlies made 36 tackles and a sack in 242 defensive snaps a year ago.

Other Colts players' injury statuses ahead of Jacksonville game

Colts rotational defensive end Tyquan Lewis is out for Sunday's game with an ankle injury that landed him on the injury report starting with Wednesday's walk-through. Lewis was estimated to have not participated Wednesday, was limited in Thursday's practice and then missed Friday's.

Cornerback Sauce Gardner, who suffered a calf injury early in Sunday's game against the Texans, is the only Indianapolis player already listed as 'out' for Sunday's road game in Jacksonville, though Gardner did avoid landing on IR, opening the possibility for him to return sometime in the next couple weeks.

Here’s the full Bears injury report for Sunday’s game at Lambeau Field:","LAKE FOREST, Ill. — Rome Odunze has been on Bears participation reports for weeks. He’d miss practices because of heel and ankle injuries, then not receive a designation on Chicago’s injury report, and play the following Sunday.

The pattern ended a few weeks back, without mention of an injury. That changed heading into Week 14. A foot injury prevented Odunze from practicing in each session leading up to Sunday’s clash with the NFC North rival Green Bay Packers.

That led the Bears to rule out their top receiver versus the Packers.

Odunze might be out longer than that. According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Odunze has been playing through a stress fracture in his foot and is now considered week-to-week, but it’s nothing that would end his season when the Bears need him most. He could miss a few games, though that’s ultimately uncertain.

Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson and linebacker Ruben Hyppolite II also were ruled out.

Linebacker T.J. Edwards (hand/hamstring) will return after practicing all week following a four-game absence.

The Bears will have Noah Sewell (elbow) back after two weeks out, though. That will offer linebacker stability that has been missing in recent weeks, even with fill-ins D’Marco Jackson and Amen Ogbongbemiga playing well. As a reminder, Tremaine Edmunds remains on injured reserve.

Running back Kyle Monangai was absent from the team’s first practice and was a DNP on a Wednesday practice estimation, but he was limited Thursday and a full participant Friday. The productive rookie wasn’t given a designation and will play.

Odunze generally plays the ‘X’ receiver spot, a position DJ Moore certainly could fill.

Per the Athletic’s Dianna Russini, Justin Herbert is expected to play against the Eagles on Monday Night Football after the surgery on his non-throwing hand.

The veteran quarterback underwent successful surgery Monday to stabilize a fractured bone in his left non-throwing hand. The team currently lists him as day to day, but Herbert has made it clear he is preparing as if he will suit up.

The injury happened late in the first quarter of the Chargers’ recent win over the Las Vegas Raiders when a hit to the hand forced Herbert to leave briefly.

He returned with a protective cast and glove and finished the game while the offense shifted to more shotgun and pistol formations. That toughness drew praise from coaches even before the surgery.

Herbert suffered a metacarpal fracture in his left hand, serious enough to need surgical stabilization. If there was any hidden ligament damage or if his grip strength did not return fast enough, his ability to handle snaps or take contact could have become a major issue for Herbert.

In the 2025 season, Justin Herbert has thrown for 2,842 yards this season with 21 touchdowns, 10 interceptions, and a 66.9 percent completion rate, giving him a 94.9 passer rating. He is averaging roughly 237 passing yards per game as he continues to anchor the Chargers’ offense.

In short, Herbert’s push to play in Week 14 shows exactly why the Chargers still believe they have a shot to steady their season.

Ostly mocks Love at No. 8 as the first running back taken in the first round.

Love has been one of the best running backs in college football this season, rushing for 1,372 yards (4th in the nation) and 18 touchdowns (3rd), while catching 27 passes for 280 yards and three scores. Through 41 games in his college career, the junior running back has rushed for 2,882 yards and scored 42 total touchdowns.

While the Cardinals could go several different directions in the first round, including quarterback and offensive tackle, running back could be an option for Arizona as the running back room has been hit hard by injuries in 2025.

Veteran James Conner suffered a season-ending foot injury in Week 3 against the San Francisco 49ers, while second-year halfback Trey Benson has been out since Week 4 due to a knee injury. Emari Demarcado has also missed the last two games due to an ankle issue.

Bam Knight has been the Cardinals leading halfback this season with 255 rushing yards and four touchdowns in 10 games played.

Ostly said Love could give the Cardinals a legitimate RB1 and a potential receiving threat out of the backfield if the team moves on from Conner. Conner has one year remaining on a two-year contract extension he signed toward the end of last season.

Love is the ideal modern running back and would be a seamless transition away from James Conner if the team wants to move on. Arizona went all-out on defense in the 2025 NFL Draft and would swing the other way with the home-run hitter and receiving threat Love.

The three Week 14 first-place showdowns are the Chicago Bears (9-3-1) at Green Bay Packers (8-3) in the NFC North, Indianapolis Colts (8-4) at Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4) in the AFC South and Pittsburgh Steelers (6-6) at Baltimore Ravens (6-6) in the AFC North.

How critical are these divisional games? Since 2002, of the 159 teams that were leading their division through Week 14, when the NFL went to eight divisions, 139 of them won their division. That's 87.4%.

It's also worth noting that all three of these games will have rematches in the coming weeks. The Packers and Bears have their second meeting within a three-game span in Week 16. The Jaguars and Colts play again in Week 17, and the Ravens face the Steelers in the regular-season finale.

FPI with win: Win division (63%), make playoffs (64%)

How did the Steelers get here? Thanks to a hot start and injuries for the rest of the AFC North teams, the Steelers appeared to be running away with the division, holding a 2½-game lead going into the Thursday night game against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 7. But Ja'Marr Chase and Joe Flacco picked apart the Steelers' defense and handed Pittsburgh a loss, kicking off a stretch during which the Steelers have lost five of their past seven games. In that span, the Steelers' defense has allowed an average of 122.7 rushing yards per game, while the offense has struggled to move the ball consistently with Mason Rudolph or Aaron Rodgers at quarterback.

QB situation: Rodgers fractured his left (non-throwing) wrist late in the first half during the rematch with the Bengals three weeks ago and was sidelined for the subsequent six quarters. Rudolph took his place in the second half and started against the Chicago Bears. During that stretch, Rudolph completed 36 of 47 attempts for 298 yards with 1 touchdown, 2 interceptions and a lost fumble. Rodgers, meanwhile, started struggling even before his wrist injury, beginning with a dismal night in the loss to the Chargers on Nov. 9, when he completed 51% of his attempts and took a sack for a safety. Coming off another subpar outing against the Bills on Nov. 30, when he completed just 47% of his attempts and split the bridge of his nose on a strip-sack, Rodgers is in line to start his second straight game with the fractured wrist Sunday.

Injury update: Not only have the Steelers been managing Rodgers' wrist injury, but they also enter Sunday's game without rookie first-round pick Derrick Harmon. Harmon is missing his second consecutive game because of a knee injury sustained in Chicago. The Steelers' defense has dealt with injuries throughout the season, including a season-ending hyperextended knee to safety DeShon Elliott and ACL tears to veteran depth defensive linemen Dean Lowry and Daniel Ekuale.

Key to winning Sunday: It all comes down to stopping the run. The Steelers didn't do that in their wild-card loss to the Ravens last season, allowing Baltimore to rush for 299 yards as Derrick Henry exploded for 186. The Steelers' run defense has been inconsistent this season, giving up a season-worst 249 rushing yards to the Buffalo Bills in its last game. But there is some reason for hope: Earlier this season, the Steelers' run defense held Jonathan Taylor, the NFL's leading rusher, to 45 yards on 14 carries in the win against the Colts. -- Brooke Pryor

What they're saying: Cameron Heyward on the late-season grind and what the team has left in the tank: ""A lot left in the tank. You sign up to play football. You don't sign up to count heartbeats. We got to do whatever it takes to get the job done. You've seen teams, you look at that Super Bowl [the Steelers won at the end of the 2005 season, beating Seattle], they had to have a string of games late to really qualify for the playoffs. So, one, you got to get off the field when you can, but two, whatever comes in front of you, you got to go out and attack it.""

Baltimore Ravens

Overall record: 6-6

Division record: 2-1

AFC North position: Tied for first place with the Ravens

Odds: Win division (-240), make playoffs (-220)

FPI with win: Win division (75%), make playoffs (75%)

FPI with loss: Win division (31%), make playoffs (31%)

How did the Ravens get here? The preseason betting favorite to win the Super Bowl, the Ravens have yet to produce one complete game this season in which every unit was clicking. The Baltimore defense struggled mightily during a franchise-worst 1-5 start, giving up an NFL-high 32.3 points per game. When the Ravens rebounded to win five of their next six games, their offense sputtered repeatedly on third down (34.7%) and in the red zone (48%), both of which rank in the bottom quarter of the league. With game changers such as quarterback Lamar Jackson and do-it-all safety Kyle Hamilton, the Ravens' players said this week that they feel there is still time for this team to hit its stride and live up to its championship potential.

QB situation: Lamar Jackson hasn't looked like Lamar Jackson. After throwing 15 touchdown passes and one interception in his first six starts, Jackson has hit the worst slump of his career, producing zero touchdowns in three straight games. Injuries and indecision have led to the two-time NFL MVP putting up some uncharacteristic numbers. He hasn't completed more than 60% of his passes in four consecutive games for the first time in his eight-year career, and he's averaging a career-low 29.3 yards rushing per game. The Ravens need Jackson to flip into MVP mode if they want to win a third straight AFC North title.

Injury update: Jackson is dealing with an ankle injury after getting stepped on during Wednesday's practice, but he is set to start Sunday. This marked the fourth straight week that Jackson has missed a practice because of an injury. He has had injuries to his knee, ankle and toe over this span. The only other injury concern was top cornerback Nate Wiggins, who missed the second half of Baltimore's last game because of a foot injury. But Wiggins practiced all week and will play against Pittsburgh, according to coach John Harbaugh.

Key to winning Sunday: Ball security. Jackson and the Ravens can't afford to give away another division game, as they did in a 32-14 loss to the Bengals on Thanksgiving night, when they turned the ball over five times. That's a strong lesson going into Sunday's game against Pittsburgh because mistakes have defined Baltimore's success against its biggest rival. Since 2022, the Ravens are 3-1 against the Steelers, including the playoffs, when they turned the ball over no more than once. Over that same span, Baltimore is 0-3 against Pittsburgh when it has committed multiple turnovers. -- Jamison Hensley

What they're saying: ""If you can't get up for this one, I think that shows something about your character [and] about your will. And honestly, I think that just shows if you are a Raven or if you're not a Raven. They say that there's no must-win game, but this is definitely a must-win game,"" cornerback Marlon Humphrey said.

AFC South: Colts at Jaguars (1 p.m. ET, CBS)

Indianapolis Colts

Overall record: 8-4

Division record: 2-1

AFC South position: Tied for first with Jaguars

Odds: Win division (+145), make playoffs (-310)

FPI with win: Win division (61%), make playoffs (88%)

FPI with loss: Win division (19%), make playoffs (57%)

How did the Colts get here? Indianapolis got off to a sizzling start, with a league-best 7-1 record through eight games. The Cots' offense was on a historic pace, leading the league in several categories. Even after consecutive subpar performances, the Colts remain the league's top-scoring team. Jonathan Taylor leads the NFL with 1,282 rushing yards and 15 rushing touchdowns, though he has been quiet the past two games. Taylor's 244-yard performance against the Atlanta Falcons last month was the biggest single-game rushing effort this season. Likewise, his 83-yard touchdown in that game was the longest run of 2025.

QB situation: The Colts believe they've found a potential long-term solution in Daniel Jones after years of flailing at quarterback. Jones, who signed a one-year free agent deal in March, won an offseason position battle with Anthony Richardson Sr. for the job and helped power Indianapolis' historic offensive start to the season. But the Colts will need Jones to come through when it matters most. They have five games remaining, all against teams with winning records. Whether Jones comes through will set the tone for offseason decisions regarding his future.

Injury update: Jones will need to perform well in spite of a small fracture in his left fibula. The issue was discovered two weeks ago and, in the two games since, Jones has posted his lowest passing yards and completion rates of the season. He has consistently said the condition is improving. Meanwhile, the Colts are still without standout defensive tackle DeForest Buckner (neck), who isn't eligible to return from injured reserve until next week. They're also likely to be without new cornerback Sauce Gardner, who sustained a calf injury Sunday and could miss multiple games.

Key to winning Sunday: The Colts have to regain the upper hand on offense by being more consistent on early downs and, thereby, keeping Taylor involved. Indianapolis was 3-of-10 on third downs in its loss to the Texans on Sunday, in part because of long down-and-distance situations. Of those 10 third downs, seven were third-and-7 or longer. Staying ""on schedule"" on offense with better production on first downs has been a key for the Colts all season. But they've dropped from 7.2 yards per play on first downs to 6 yards per play in the past two games. -- Stephen Holder

What they're saying: ""We're playing really good teams now. So, we've got to be more on point with some of those things than maybe we did earlier in the season. We've got a hard stretch coming up. We got a big game this weekend, so perfect time to get back on track,"" Josh Downs said.

Jacksonville Jaguars

Overall record: 8-4

Division record: 32-1

AFC South position: Tied for first with Colts

Odds: Win division (+145), make playoffs (-550)

FPI with win: Win division (64%), make playoffs (96%)

FPI with loss: Win division (19%), make playoffs (75%)

How did the Jaguars get here? They've won four of their past five games despite a slew of injuries that led to 10 starters missing games over that stretch: WR/CB Travis Hunter (knee, done for season), DE Travon Walker (knee), CB Jourdan Lewis (neck), S Eric Murray (neck), RG Patrick Mekari (concussion), LG Ezra Cleveland (knee), WR Brian Thomas Jr. (ankle), TE Brenton Strange (hip), DT Arik Armstead (hand), and LB Devin Lloyd (calf). Their depth has held up, though, and they won two OT games on the road by making plays late. The one constant has been RB Travis Etienne Jr. and the run game.

QB situation: Trevor Lawrence has been up and down all season, as evidenced by his past two games: Four turnovers against Arizona, followed by none and his highest passer rating (111.5) of the season against Tennessee. However, that's partly due to coach Liam Coen encouraging Lawrence to ""let it rip."" The addition of Jakobi Meyers at the trade deadline has given Lawrence a sure-handed receiver and he has become the receiver Lawrence trusts the most in just four games (18 catches on 21 targets).

Injury update: Lewis (their top cornerback), Lloyd, Cleveland, Thomas and Strange are back, and Murray is likely to return Sunday. WR Parker Washington (hip) and LT Walker Little (concussion) were hurt last week and their availability is in doubt. Walker hasn't practiced since getting hurt Nov. 16, so he might not play, either. Armstead is a question, too. Those last two are some of the Jaguars' better pass rushers, but also critical players on the run defense tasked with limiting Taylor.

Key to winning Sunday: It starts with keeping Taylor in check. The Colts are 3-4 in games in which Taylor has rushed for fewer than 100 yards, including the past two (losses to Kansas City and Houston). Surprisingly, Taylor has not had much success in Jacksonville. In four games at EverBank Stadium, he has failed to rush for more than 77 yards, and the Colts -- who haven't won in Jacksonville since 2014 -- are 0-4 in those games. -- Michael DiRocco

What they're saying: ""We come back, we prepare the same way that we always have, especially this last couple of weeks, keep our focus internally, go out there and play our brand football, we'll win this game,"" defensive end Josh Hines-Allen said.

NFC North: Bears at Packers (4:25 p.m. ET, Fox)

Chicago Bears

Overall record: 9-3

Division record: 1-2

NFC North position: First

Odds: Win division (+175), make playoffs (-270)

FPI with win: Win division (59%), make playoffs (92%)

FPI with loss: Win division (20%), make playoffs (67%)

How did the Bears get here? The Bears have won five straight, including a defining 24-15 win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Black Friday that legitimized their résumé. Chicago is built on the NFL's No. 2 rushing offense (153.8 yards/game), an opportunistic defense that leads the league in takeaways (26) and turnover margin (plus-17, no other team is better than plus-9). Caleb Williams' growth under coach Ben Johnson was clear as Williams led five game-winning drives in the fourth quarter/overtime. It's a critical part of why the Bears have pulled off several late-game rallies to boast a 6-1 record in one-score games.

QB situation: Johnson clarified his comments about the Bears ""winning in spite of our passing game, not because of it,"" so it wouldn't be construed that he's unhappy with Williams' play. Johnson was pleased with how Williams managed the game against Philadelphia, but the quarterback's accuracy issues are concerning. Williams is last in completion percentage (58%) and completion percentage over expectation (-9%), and his five interceptions have come against zone coverage. The Packers' defense has run zone on 69% of opponents' dropbacks this season (third highest in NFL).

Injury update: The Bears' defense will get a much-needed boost at linebacker. T.J. Edwards was back at practice this week for the first time since breaking his hand against the Bengals on Nov. 2 and does not carry an injury designation for the Packers game. The Bears will also have linebacker Noah Sewell back in the fold, which will go a long way toward how the Bears can scheme against Josh Jacobs and the Packers' run game. Wide receiver Rome Odunze will miss the first game of his NFL career because of a foot injury that he's been dealing with throughout the season.

Key to winning Sunday: Chicago's run game has been at its best on the road, with season highs in rushing at Cincinnati and Philadelphia. After dual 100-yard rushing performances from Monangai and D'Andre Swift, the Bears should lean heavily on their ground attack to set the tone and control the clock the way they did against the Eagles. With injuries along Green Bay's defensive line, notably to tackle Devonte Wyatt, the Bears' offensive line comes to Lambeau Field with the edge up front. -- Courtney Cronin

What they're saying: ""The significance of it at the moment isn't much,"" tight end Cole Kmet said of the Bears currently being the NFC's No. 1 seed. ""Look, I know how this all is. We're on the so-called mountain top right now, but those things change quickly week to week. ... It's on us to stick to our process on stuff. But to see where we've gone as a team, specifically offensively from Weeks 1 and 2 to now, it's really cool to see and see our identity take shape, especially in the run game.""

Green Bay Packers

Overall record: 8-3-1

Division record: 3-0

NFC North position: Second

Odds: Win division (-140), make playoffs (-900)

FPI with win: Win division (70%), make playoffs (95%)

FPI with loss: Win division (25%), make playoffs (76%)

How did the Packers get here? Unlike last season, when they went 1-5 in NFC North games -- with the only win coming on a last-second blocked field goal attempt in Chicago -- the Packers have taken care of business in the division. The Thanksgiving win at Detroit gave them the season sweep of the Lions for the first time since 2020. This is the end of a three-game stretch of all division games, which started with the Week 12 win over the Vikings. After consecutive home losses to the Panthers and Eagles in which they combined to score only 20 points, Packers coach Matt LaFleur found something on offense. In the three games since those two losses, they have the fourth-most offensive points per game in the league.

QB situation: This is Jordan Love's time of the year, and his four-touchdown game against the Lions last week might be the start of another strong stretch to close the season. In his three seasons as the Packers' starter, Love has played some of his best football when the calendar turns to November. In 24 career regular-season games in November or later, Love has combined for 37 touchdowns and six interceptions while completing 65.8% of his passes. Love has the NFL's highest Total QBR (73.3) in games played in November or later over the past three seasons.

Injury update: The Packers have lost three starters to season-ending injuries: tight end Tucker Kraft (knee), center Elgton Jenkins (leg) and, most recently, defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt (ankle). They could get a boost from the return of receiver Jayden Reed, their leader in the past two seasons in catches and receiving yards. Reed hasn't played since Week 2 because of collarbone and foot injuries.

Key to winning Sunday: The Packers have a top-10 run defense, but it will be tested mightily by the Bears' running back duo of Monangai and Swift, who each rushed for more than 100 yards in last week's win over the Eagles. Wyatt's injury against the Lions won't help, but the Packers will have to keep the Bears from running all over them. ""It's going to be a great challenge,"" LaFleur said, ""because they're the best in the league right now in doing it."" -- Rob Demovsky

What they're saying: Packers WR Christian Watson on the magnitude of the Packers-Bears game: ""It's huge, it's huge. I said it earlier in the week, it's a chance for us to take the top spot in the NFC North, and that's step one for us in terms of our goal for this season. So it's big-time for us.""

Jayden Daniels, QB, Washington Commanders - Expected To Play

After dislocating his elbow in Week 9, Daniels finally seems to be in the clear for the Commanders. He was a full practice participant on Thursday for the first time since his injury, and has officially been cleared for contact.

Rome Odunze, WR, Chicago Bears - Out

The Bears haven't been known for their passing offense this season, but wideout Rome Odunze has been the top target when the Bears have to move the ball through the air, hauling in 44 catches for 661 yards and six touchdowns. He has been dealing with heel pain, but has yet to miss a game. That will change this week against Green Bay, as Odunze missed practice all week with a foot injury and will not be available for the Bears-Packers clash.

Justin Herbert, QB, Los Angeles Chargers - Expected To Play

Herbert underwent surgery just earlier this week for a fractured left hand, but is reportedly still preparing to play against the Eagles on Monday Night Football. Herbert was limited in practice both Thursday and Friday, but Chargers head coach Jim Harbaugh is expecting Herbert to suit up per usual. Herbert disclosed on Thursday that doctors inserted a plate and screws into his hand to stabilize it, and that he will likely be in a hard cast during Monday's game.

Mike Evans, WR, Tampa Bay Buccaneers - Out

Since breaking his clavicle on October 22, Evans has been out of action. This week, he was designated to return from injured reserve, and his 21-day practice window opened, but head coach Todd Bowles made it clear he will not return this weekend. Evans' absence could bring his 11-season streak of 1,000-or-more receiving yards to an end.

Tee Higgins, WR, Cincinnati Bengals - Expected To Play

After missing the Bengals' last game with a concussion, Higgins was a full participant in practice on Thursday and has officially been cleared of concussion protocol entering Week 14

Sauce Gardner, CB, Indianapolis Colts - Out

After Gardner was seen on crutches and donning a walking boot following last week's loss to the Texans, the good news for fans of the Colts is that his injury isn't quite as severe as initially expected. The bad news, however, is that he will be unavailable against the Jaguars this week.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Tc9l1zwAa2cSaUQvsi121g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/touchdown_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_829/abadca8f2491bbe1663fe7072c3057ac,N,,2025-12-06 18:01:10.143539

“J-Reed should be good to go, which is exciting, and Julian is planning on playing,” Macdonald said. “We’re gonna play it accordingly. We have a plan and we’ll see how the game goes. But excited to have those guys back.”

Huard: This is the best defensive front in Seahawks history

Neither Love (hamstring) nor Reed (wrist, thumb) were given a game status designation on Friday’s injury report. Both players are still on injured reserve, but the Seahawks have two open 53-man roster spots to activate them off IR ahead of Sunday’s game.

Love has missed nine of Seattle’s 12 games with a hamstring injury, including each of the past eight games. Reed has missed the past four games after undergoing surgery to repair a wrist/thumb injury. Both players returned to practice this week.

With Love set to return, the Seahawks are on track to have their entire starting secondary on the field together for the first time since the opening defensive series of Week 1.

In addition to Love, two-time Pro Bowl cornerback Devon Witherspoon missed five games due to injury earlier this season, rookie safety Nick Emmanwori missed three games, and cornerbacks Riq Woolen and Josh Jobe each missed one game apiece. Safety Coby Bryant is the only starter in Seattle’s secondary to play all 12 games.

The only two Seahawks with game status designations on Friday’s injury report were wide receiver/kick returner Dareke Young (quadricep) and rookie defensive end Rylie Mills (knee). Young is on IR, while Mills has spent all season on the non-football injury list while rehabbing from a torn ACL that he suffered last December.

That means every other player who appeared on Seattle’s injury report this week is considered healthy enough to play on Sunday. That includes running back Kenneth Walker III (glute), right guard Anthony Bradford (elbow, calf), tight end AJ Barner (knee, shoulder), wide receiver Cody White (abdomen) and safety Ty Okada (oblique).

Packers Week 14 injury report","The Green Bay Packers released their final injury report of Week 14 on Friday afternoon. Matt LaFleur's team ruled out five players and listed five others as questionable before playing the Chicago Bears on Sunday at Lambeau Field.

As is the case every week in pro football, the injury report provided good news and bad news.

Here's a closer look at the injury report for the Packers entering Week 14:

Good news

-- Linebacker Quay Walker has no status designation and will return to the field after missing back-to-back games with a stinger. Isaiah McDuffie played exceedingly well as the ""Mike"" linebacker in wins over the Vikings and Lions, but the Packers will need Walker's speed and toughness against quarterback Caleb Williams and the Bears run game on Sunday.

-- Receiver Jayden Reed was listed as questionable, which keeps the door open to him being activated Saturday and then becoming available on Sunday for the first time since Week 2. During each of the last two weeks, the Packers ruled out Reed on the final injury report. This time around, Reed has a chance. Matt LaFleur said he ""hopes"" Reed can play Sunday, but the Packers slot receiver still needs to get medical clearance to go.

-- The Packers are getting back Karl Brooks, who has no status designation after missing last week's win with an ankle injury. Expect Brooks to be the new starter at defensive tackle with Devonte Wyatt out for the season. Brooks was first injured in New York and then played only four snaps against the Vikings before missing last week in Detroit. While he'll likely be less than 100 percent on Sunday, the Packers need him to stand tall against a very good interior offensive line for the Bears.

-- Running back Josh Jacobs was upgraded to a full participant at practice on Friday, suggesting the knee injury he suffered in New York three weeks ago is no longer a major concern. Jacobs played 34 snaps last week against the Lions, but that number could rise on Sunday.

-- Defensive end Brenton Cox Jr. was listed as questionable, so he's nearing a return after having his 21-day practice window opened on Monday. He could provide a spark for the backup edge rusher rotation, especially with Lukas Van Ness out. Last season, Cox had 4.0 sacks and seven quarterback hits in only seven games. He hasn't been available since Week 1.

Bad news

-- Javon Bullard's status is ""up in the air,"" per Matt LaFleur. He missed back-to-back practices on Thursday and Friday due to the lingering effects of an ankle injury he previously suffered. Bullard has been excellent in the Packers' zone coverage scheme and is an impact slot defender against the run. Nate Hobbs is a potential replacement in the slot, but he hasn't played since Week 9. If both are out, the Packers will have to get really creative in nickel personnel.

-- Lukas Van Ness will miss his seventh game in eight weeks with a foot injury. He's played all of six snaps since suffering the injury on a sack of Joe Flacco in Week 6. The 2023 first-round pick is missing important snaps, and his breakout season was stopped in its tracks. Can Van Ness eventually return and help supercharge the pass rush at some point over the final four weeks? Losing Devonte Wyatt and not having Van Ness available in the same week is a tough blow to the defensive front.

-- Rookie receiver and returner Savion Williams is out for a second straight game. He's ""battling through"" a foot injury that has lingered for over a month. The Packers are hoping the time off will let the injury heal, and he can contribute later this season. Bo Melton will likely be the kick returner on Sunday.

-- There are still question marks at receiver. Jayden Reed (collarbone/foot) and Matthew Golden (wrist) are both questionable, and Savion Williams is out again. Saturday is going to be an important day for understanding who will be available come Sunday. If the Packers don't activate Reed from injured reserve, he'll be out again. And if Golden can't go, the Packers will likely have to elevate a wide receiver from the practice squad. If both are good to go, the Packers passing game could get a huge boost before a matchup against an increasingly stingy Bears secondary that recently returned Jaylon Johnson and Kyler Gordon.

Kansas City can win this game at home even with its problems on the offensive line and on defense.","The AFC South has garnered a rather unfavorable reputation over the years as an afterthought among NFL divisions.

Maybe that isn’t so heading into Week 14 this season, when the Indianapolis Colts attempt to defeat the Jaguars in Jacksonville for the first time since 2014. Both teams are 8-4 but can’t get too comfortable with the Houston Texans (and their stingy defense) on their heels. Houston is on the road Sunday night against the Kansas City Chiefs, whose dynasty inches closer to crumbling with another loss.

Another sight not often seen in December — high stakes in a Chicago Bears-Green Bay Packers game. The rivals meet with the NFC North lead on the line.

Our NFL writers Zak Keefer, Jeff Howe and Mike Sando discuss all things Week 14 in The Athletic’s latest roundtable.

The Colts have lost their grip on the AFC South, haven’t won in Jacksonville in a decade, and Daniel Jones is dealing with a fibula injury. Can Jonathan Taylor solve all their problems, or is there a bigger issue at play here? Have the Jags earned our trust yet, or do we need to see more?

Keefer: The Colts might be the most tenuous 8-4 team in recent memory. All the momentum they built during their 8-1 start has fizzled in a matter of weeks; suddenly, the talk shows in Indianapolis are bringing up the team’s recent late-season collapses — and there are plenty to choose from. Jones is playing hurt, and the fibula is preventing Shane Steichen from opening up the playbook with his quarterback’s running ability. Steichen had all the answers early. He seems to have none of them lately. If the Colts drop this one in Jacksonville — where they haven’t won since Andrew Luck’s third NFL season — their chances at a playoff spot will dwindle. Just weigh their last four games: at the Seattle Seahawks, vs. the San Francisco 49ers, vs. Jacksonville, at Houston. That’s a brutal stretch.

Howe: Aside from Jones’ injury, the Colts’ slide coincides with a turn in the schedule, and I don’t like their chances of holding it together to make the playoffs. Not only do they have to find their way through that closing gantlet, but they’ve got to withstand the surging Texans and lurking Chiefs. With the Jaguars, I trust their ability to make the playoffs, and I think they’re dangerous enough to beat just about anyone on any given week. But they also make a few mistakes each week to make life harder on themselves than necessary. I’d take the Jags to win the division and the Texans to steal the Colts’ wild-card spot.

Sando: The Jaguars have not earned my trust because their offense is not consistent enough. This Colts team is better than the ones that fell apart in previous seasons, so I’ll (tenuously) take them to win this game at Jacksonville despite the Jones injury. Houston feels like the top team in the AFC South. The Jaguars and Colts need the Chiefs to beat Houston at Arrowhead.

Bears-Packers matters in December for the first time in some years. The Bears seem to be winning “in spite of their passing game.” Do you agree, or is Caleb Williams better than the stats suggest? Stinkers versus the Carolina Panthers and Philadelphia Eagles seem like a lifetime ago. Has the Packers offense figured it out yet?

Keefer: Williams has improved this year, but his completion percentage (58.1) remains a concern. It ranks 33rd among quarterbacks to start a game this season. The impetus behind the Bears’ stunning revival has been the run game and the defense’s ability to take the football away. I like Green Bay in this one — that receiving group can be lethal when Matt LaFleur calls an aggressive game, as he did last week at the Detroit Lions. Christian Watson’s return has lifted that unit to a different level.

Howe: Ben Johnson has done wonders for Williams, but he’s still very much a work in progress. Johnson has shrunk the field to limit Williams’ reads, allowing him to break from the pocket to create off schedule, so there’s a mix of the best of both worlds. But yeah, the offense is driven by its physicality on the ground, which was Johnson’s intention in the spring. It’s impressive to see it come together. The Packers are figuring it out, but I want to see them handle this upcoming stretch before I’m ready to feel more comfortable with them going into the playoffs. Their offensive injuries, which always seem to follow them, are a concern, too.

Sando: The Bears are definitely winning despite their passing game. That is better than losing because of their passing game, however. Williams’ sack avoidance this season is the difference between those two things. Chicago will stumble some down the stretch because of the schedule, but this is already a solid first season under Ben Johnson. Williams is learning how to play in a structured offense and will have to stick with it to succeed long-term.

The Buffalo Bills are coming off a win at the Pittsburgh Steelers but have been anything but consistent this season. Joe Burrow sounds like he wants to play spoiler down the stretch. Should Buffalo be worried, or did last week’s historic rushing performance against the Steelers convince you the Bills figured something out?

Keefer: Sunday’s win in Pittsburgh was more about the Steelers’ issues — and there are a lot of them — than the Bills’ finding something. Maybe I’m wrong, but Buffalo isn’t good enough to relax down the stretch, as in years past. The defense is leaky against the run, and without a dominant rushing attack, Buffalo remains eminently beatable. Another upset by the Cincinnati Bengals wouldn’t stun me.

Howe: The Bills have been far too inconsistent for two months to think they got right against the reeling Steelers. And the Bills better be worried about the Bengals because Burrow is absolutely capable of dicing them up. The Bills will win a high-scoring one-possession game.

Sando: Buffalo is not what it used to be, no matter what happened in Pittsburgh. The team no longer has a defense that serves as a safety net for those days when the offense is not firing. Buffalo is 0-4 this season and 1-7 over the past two when finishing games with below-average offensive output (negative EPA on that side of the ball). The team had a 14-16 record in those games from 2019 to 2023. The margin for error is smaller as a result.

Texans-Chiefs highlights Sunday night. Which team’s postseason chances are we more confident in right now and why?

Keefer: I’m taking Houston here, and it wasn’t a difficult decision. Have you seen this defense? It’s menacing at all three levels, and Will Anderson Jr. would be getting more Defensive Player of the Year chatter if it wasn’t for Myles Garrett’s historic season. My bet is the Chiefs’ offense won’t be able to move the ball consistently against a Texans defense that has allowed 20 points just twice this season. Houston stays hot. KC’s playoff hopes fade.

Howe: The Texans have five wins against teams that are in the playoff field, which is noteworthy because none of the seven AFC playoff teams has more than two such victories. They’re well tested, and their defense is a consistent strength. The Chiefs looked like they were ready to go on a run entering their Week 9 game against the Bills, but they instead lost three of four. All were high-stakes games, none on a bigger stage than the Thanksgiving showdown in Dallas, and they just haven’t been able to get it done. The Chiefs need far too much help in too short a stretch to feel good about their chances.

Sando: I lean toward Houston but think this game against the Chiefs will be pivotal one way or another. I’m conflicted. Kansas City can win this game at home even with its problems on the offensive line and on defense. I’m reluctant to pick against the Chiefs in this game even though Houston should win. That’s why it’s a tenuous lean toward Houston.

Nick Sirianni backs Kevin Patullo, his offensive coordinator. Eagles fans clearly do not. Is this the right move for Sirianni, or is it time for a change in play calling? Meanwhile, Justin Herbert’s injury history is getting lengthy at this point, but he hasn’t missed many games in his career (four). Should he really try to play through this left hand injury Monday night versus Philadelphia?

Keefer: I picked the Eagles last week, believing in the champs’ ability to find some offensive cohesion against a Bears team I wasn’t totally buying. I was dead wrong. This Philly season is starting to feel a lot like 2023. The vibes aren’t right. The frustration is building. The offensive creativity, let alone cohesion, simply isn’t there. It starts on early downs, where the Eagles consistently find little success. Patullo is an easy scapegoat, but there’s more to this. Maybe Lane Johnson’s eventual return will save them, but I wouldn’t be stunned if the Chargers hand them another loss Monday — assuming Herbert makes it back.

Howe: The offensive line isn’t as dominant as it’s been in past years, and it’s causing issues everywhere else. That’s not on Patullo.

Every Raven on the 53-man roster is healthy enough to play against Pittsburgh.

Jackson missed Thursday's practice due to an ankle injury. He confirmed that his foot was stepped on during Wednesday's practice and said he's doing ""pretty good"" now. Jackson declined to say who stepped on him.

Jackson hasn't had a full week of practice in a month due to knee, ankle, and toe injuries. He's hoping to come out sharper against the Steelers after he had three turnovers in the Ravens' Thanksgiving loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.

The Ravens offense has been sluggish in recent weeks and Jackson hasn't thrown a touchdown pass in the last three games. The Steelers defense, which ranks 28th in the league, could give Jackson and the Ravens another chance to get on the right track offensively.

Top cornerback Nate Wiggins will play against the Steelers after suffering a foot injury against the Bengals on Thanksgiving. Wiggins returned to full practice on Friday.

Wide receivers Rashod Bateman (ankle) and Devontez Walker (groin) both also returned to full practice Friday and will play against the Steelers.

Left tackle Ronnie Stanley was the only other Ravens player missing from Friday's practice, but that was only a rest day. Defensive tackle Travis Jones, who missed Thursday's practice due to personal reasons, returned a day later.

Ravens Rule Out Ar'Darius Washington After First Week of Practice

Ar'Darius Washington's return will have to wait at least another week, as he has been ruled out for Sunday's game.

Washington returned to practice this week after suffering an Achilles tear in May. The fact that he had a chance to play against the Steelers, according to Harbaugh, was an impressive feat already.

Washington did log a full practice participation Friday after being limited in his first two days, which means he's closer to being ready for game action with the rematch against the Cincinnati Bengals next on the schedule.

Outside linebacker Tavius Robinson (foot) has also been ruled out for Sunday's game. He was limited throughout the week in practice.

Patrick Queen Will Play, But Steelers Rule Out Starting Safety

Former Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen will play against the Ravens after exiting Sunday's loss to the Buffalo Bills early with a glute injury.

He was a limited practice participant on Thursday and Friday but doesn't have an injury designation entering the game.

The Steelers will be without starting safety Kyle Dugger, who has been ruled out due to a hand injury. Dugger has given the Steelers defense a spark since being acquired via trade about a month ago. Former Raven Chuck Clark or Jabrill Peppers is expected to start.

Quarterback Aaron Rodgers (left wrist) was a full participant on Friday.

“I hope so,” Packers coach Matt LaFleur said.

Reed hasn’t played since the Week 2 game against the Washington Commanders after having collarbone and foot surgeries. His 21-day practice window opened Nov. 21, and he hasn’t missed a day of practice since. The Packers have until next Friday, Dec. 12 to activate him.

“We’re still kind of going through that process of being fully cleared medically,” LaFleur said during his Dec. 5 pre-practice news conference.

If Reed is able to go, he could be a big boost against a surging Bears team in a highly anticipated NFC North matchup.

Reed’s game status and a few other players still are up in the air as four players on the active roster were sidelined during the Dec. 5 practice.

Here’s the latest:

Packers injury report: five questionable, five out vs. Bears

On the final injury report of the week, Jayden Reed (shoulder/foot), Matthew Golden (wrist), Javon Bullard (ankle), Nate Hobbs (knee) and Brenton Cox, Jr. (groin) are questionable to play against the Bears.

Savion Williams (foot), MarShawn Lloyd (calf), Lukas Van Ness (foot), Devonte Wyatt (ankle) and Collin Oliver (hamstring) are ruled out.

For the Bears, their leading receiver, Rome Odunze (foot), is out along with linebacker Ruben Hyppolite II and cornerback Tyrique Stevenson.

Javon Bullard injury update

Packers nickel corner Javon Bullard has missed the past two days of practice due to an ankle injury.

LaFleur said his injury came in the Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions and it’s unclear if he’ll play against the Bears.

“Just was having some lingering effects,” LaFleur said. “So, we thought it would be best to shut him down and see how he progresses throughout the course of the week.”

Quay Walker injury update

Packers linebacker Quay Walker did not have a game status on the injury report, meaning he'll play against the Bears.

Walker, who missed two games due to a stinger in his neck, was a limited participant in practice on Dec. 3, but was upgraded to a full participant the last two practices.

Savion Williams injury update

Packers rookie receiver and return specialist Savion Williams missed practice all week.

He did not play in the Lions game.

“It’s definitely not a setback,” LaFleur said. “It’s more or less just battling through and what we think Is best for the long-term.”

Lukas Van Ness injury update

Packers defensive end Lukas Van Ness missed practice all week.

Van Ness missed five games due to a foot injury, and returned in Week 12 against the Minnesota Vikings, but played just six snaps. He did not play in the Lions game

Nate Hobbs injury update

Packers cornerback Nate Hobbs practiced all week, making it possible he’ll play for the first time in four games. He’s been battling a knee injury

Coaches said he’s practiced well this week.

“Dealing with his injury, we want him to have confidence in himself where he can go and have success,” Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley said Dec. 4. “And I think he’s really close to that point.”

Matthew Golden injury update

Packers receiver Matthew Golden practiced every day this week giving him a positive sign that he’ll play against the Bears.

The rookie receiver missed the past two games dealing with injuries to his shoulder and wrist.

“He’s gone out there and caught some balls in practice,” LaFleur said. “Another guy I think that will be questionable leading up to game time, depending upon how he’s feeling.”

Karl Brooks injury update

Packers defensive tackle Karl Brooks, who missed the Lions game due to an ankle injury, practiced all week.

Brooks didn't have a game status on the injury report meaning he will play against the Bears.

Devonte Wyatt injury update

Packers defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt is not on injured reserve yet, but LaFleur confirmed this week that Wyatt would be out for the rest of the season due to an ankle injury he suffered at the end of the game against the Lions on Thanksgiving.

Update on injured-reserve players

Reed, MarShawn Lloyd, Brenton Cox Jr. and Collin Oliver practiced all week.

Aaron Glenn made the announcement before Friday’s practice in advance of Sunday’s game against the Dolphins at MetLife Stadium.

The coach added that rookie Brady Cook will serve as the backup to Tyrod Taylor, and they would see how Fields’ knee progresses to determine his status going forward.

But with just five games remaining on the schedule, there’s a decent chance Fields has played his last game for the Jets.

And he could soon end up on the growing list of quarterbacks who have come to the Jets and flopped before leaving town — a list that includes Aaron Rodgers, Zach Wilson and Sam Darnold in just the past six seasons.

Having already lost his starting job, Glenn said Fields’ knee injury “popped up in practice” Wednesday.

It limited Fields on Thursday, and he was held out Friday.

Regardless of how Fields might recover from the knee soreness, it’s hard to see how he can make anything out of what’s been a failure in his first season with the Jets.

Signed after a bumpy and disappointing year with the Steelers after his time with the Bears came to an end, Fields was brought in to bring some life to the Jets offense under Glenn in his first year in Florham Park.

Instead, it has been a mess, and while he showed some solid play in a handful of games, the 11th-overall pick in 2021 seems to be on his way out of a third franchise.

After opening the season as the starter — and starting the first nine games of the season — Fields hasn’t played since Nov. 13 against the Patriots, having been benched in favor of Taylor.

CHECK OUT THE LATEST NFL STANDINGS AND JETS STATS

The Jets went just 2-7 in those games after signing Fields to a two-year, $40 million deal, with $30 million guaranteed, in the offseason.

He’s guaranteed $10 million for next year and said after being benched he wants to be a starter again somewhere.

Though Taylor figures to run the offense for most of the rest of this lost season, Glenn said he’s liked what he’s seen from Cook, who has yet to appear in an NFL game.

Cook, 24, was signed by the Jets as an undrafted free agent coming out of Missouri in May.

He was signed to the practice squad in August and has been active against Cincinnati and Tampa Bay due to injuries to Fields and Taylor.

“The one thing that we do quite a bit in practice is we have a number of competition periods, and you see exactly how he goes about his business when his time comes up to really be in that situation to compete. He looks forward to it,” Glenn said of Cook. “He’s going to be a quarterback in this league. I do know that. I can’t tell you when, but he’ll be a quarterback in this league.”

And with the Jets, anything is possible when it comes to quarterback turmoil.

They have the draft capital to get a top pick in the draft, so regardless of how this season ends, they will have someone else under center in 2026 after another unsuccessful attempt at landing a franchise quarterback.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/newspress-collage-51dd2rslm-1764954794447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1764936811&w=1200,N,,2025-12-06 14:02:38.602649

That’s how they know he’s ready.","Ty Robinson hasn’t seen much playing time in his rookie season, but that might have to change on Monday night when the Eagles will be without Jalen Carter.

And the rookie defensive tackle knows he’s ready.

While the fourth-round pick out of Nebraska has played a total of just 35 defensive snaps all season, he does go against the Eagles’ offensive line in practice. So he has been able to track his progress.

“One of the best O-lines in the NFL,” Robinson said on Friday. “I think it’s a pretty good gauge. If I’m having a good day against them, things are going in the right direction.”

While the 24-year-old rookie said the Eagles haven’t yet talked to him about what his role might look like against the Chargers on Monday night, it seems likely he’ll have one. Carter is the Eagles’ top defensive tackle so it’ll be an all-hands-on-deck approach to replace him.

Obviously, that will start with Jordan Davis, Moro Ojomo and Byron Young. But Robinson will likely see some playing time too. He’s excited for this opportunity.

“I think just be able to show and prove myself to the organization and prove myself that I’m able to go out there and compete with the guys,” Robinson said. “I’m just excited for whatever they’re willing to give me.”

Robinson has played just 35 snaps all season and 19 of them came in the first Giants game when Carter was held out with a foot injury. Robinson played a smattering of snaps earlier in the season too.

But we’re now in Week 14 and Robinson feels way more prepared for his opportunity this time around.

“Definitely,” he said. “I didn’t know nothing coming into the season, right? But being around the guys halfway through the season, I definitely feel like I’ve grown as a player. And obviously I feel a little more ready. But it’s a challenge. I’m not going to back away from a challenge. I’m going to take what I can with it.”

Robinson hasn’t been playing on game days but he has been improving behind the scenes with the help from the Eagles’ player development team. Robinson credited that group with helping him to set goals and Robinson sets some for himself too.

He gave an example of focusing on his strikes one week and then his feet the next, and then working to combine them the following week. He has been taking incremental steps to make himself a better overall player and that improvement has been seen by his teammates in practice.

That’s how they know he’s ready.

“Practice reps,” Jordan Davis said. “Going against the ones on offense. Just the reps he’s getting against Landon (Dickerson) and against Jordan Mailata and against Cam (Jurgens), all those kind of compound and add up.

“When he gets his opportunity to go against a former Eagles player, Mekhi Becton, or somebody that’s on the Chargers’ line, we have full confidence in him that he can go out there and execute. It’s more about the mindset that he has preparing out there and understanding that he is meant to be here. He is here for a reason.”

Like most players coming from college, Robinson was used to a heavy workload at Nebraska. After being inactive each of the last four weeks, Robinson admitted it is “definitely a strange feeling” to not play very much.

But Robinson also said he’s a realistic person and he knows this is a violent game. He motivated himself by understanding that injuries happen and he had to be ready for his opportunity.

That opportunity is finally here.

“I understood when I came here that I was going to be around a bunch of dudes,” Robinson said. “I knew that I was going to have to work even harder to have this opportunity to get on the field. Obviously, the Eagles believed in me and being able to do that. I just have to do the same thing.”",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/09/Robinson-T-USATSI-26306803.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-06 14:02:50.787735

Coach Sean McDermott said Friday morning that Palmer has not practiced all week and he would be listed as doubtful for the game, which is all but a guarantee that he will be on the sidelines.

Joey Bose, Terrel Bernard out in Bills injury report

As for players already ruled out, there are two - edge rusher Joey Bosa and linebacker Terrel Bernard. Bosa suffered a hamstring injury in the victory over the Steelers last Sunday, while Bernard will miss his second straight game after suffering a dislocated elbow in the loss at Houston on Nov. 20.

McDermott said that edge rusher AJ Epenesa, who did practice Thursday because of a foot injury, was back to work Friday and he’ll be fine for the game, obviously a good piece of news with Bosa already out.

Will Dalton Kincaid play vs Bengals?

Tight end Dalton Kincaid’s situation, though, remains murky. He has missed the last three games with a hamstring injury and Thursday was wearing a brace on the knee that he hurt last season. McDermott said that it was more of a precautionary thing with the brace, but still, it’s not great for his potential to play in a game where the Bills could really use his presence in the sagging passing game.

There was more good news as offensive tackle Dion Dawkins has officially cleared concussion protocol and will be good to go for the game. The other offensive tackle, Spencer Brown, has been limited in practice with the shoulder injury that forced him to miss the Pittsburgh. His status will likely be questionable and if he can’t play, the Bills have several choices to replace him including Ryan Van Demark, Alec Anderson or Tylan Grable.

Joshua Palmer's frustrating season continues

Palmer has endured a frustrating season. The free agent signee started slowly and had minimal impact in the first five games, then suffered an ankle injury in Week 6 at Atlanta which knocked him out for three games.

He played in two games and again had very little impact, then reaggravated the injury in practice last week and was inactive for the Steelers game.

Fortunately for the Bills, they will be able to overcome his absence with Khalil Shakir, Keon Coleman, Tyrell Shavers, Gabe Davis and newcomer Brandin Cooks available to play.","https://www.democratandchronicle.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/16/PROC/87308192007-20251116-t-192016-z-1326800549-mt-1-usatoday-27605322-rtrmadp-3-nfltampabaybuccaneersatbuffalobills.JPG?crop=3957,2226,x0,y206&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-06 12:04:41.891012

Prior to his injury, Murray was completing 68.3 of his passes while averaging 192.4 passing yards per game with six touchdowns and three interceptions.","Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray will not play again this season, coach Jonathan Gannon announced on Friday. Murray hasn't taken a snap since Oct. 5 due to a mid-foot sprain, and he hasn't made sufficient progress in his recovery, Gannon told reporters.

Gannon said Murray sought a second opinion regarding his injury, and the foot isn't healing fast enough for him to get back on the field in 2025.

""Kyler will not play again this year,"" Gannon said. ""He had some more tests done this week. Went out of state and got another opinion on it. It's not progressing where it's gonna make sense that he can go. He's gonna be done for the year.""

Even before the injury, there was already speculation that Murray may be playing his last season with the Cardinals. Now, it seems like a possibility that Murray has played his last game with the franchise that selected him at No. 1 overall in 2019.

Asked whether Murray would be the Cardinals' starting quarterback in 2026, Gannon deflected focus to the team's Week 14 game against the Los Angeles Rams.

""I'm worried about the Rams right now, honestly,"" Gannon said.

Kyler Murray shut down for rest of 2025: Potential landing spots if Cardinals trade veteran QB

Tyler Sullivan

Murray was initially injured in the Cardinals' Week 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans and was put on injured reserve Nov. 5. When Murray was put on IR, Gannon said he hoped Murray would be able to return this season.

Without Murray behind center, the Cardinals have gone 1-6 with Jacoby Brissett as the starter and have fallen to 3-9 on the year. However, that record conceals the fact that Arizona's offense has been better in a number of areas with Brissett at the helm.

Prior to his injury, Murray was completing 68.3 of his passes while averaging 192.4 passing yards per game with six touchdowns and three interceptions. He was also rushing for 34.6 yards per game with one touchdown.

Meanwhile, Brissett is averaging 243.1 passing yards per game with 13 touchdowns to four interceptions while connecting on 67.5% of his throws.

There hasn't been much of a drop-off at quarterback with Murray out, and that has created big questions about his future in Arizona. It may be tough for the Cardinals to find a trade partner next offseason, thanks to Murray's massive contract, but they still have some options at their disposal.",https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2025/12/05/f51c1ba0-643e-475d-9717-d1630be159e3/thumbnail/1200x675/e7898d8d91c178d33101dd599ce4448d/gettyimages-2242098375-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 13:02:40.118100

There are no signs this foot injury will be a multi-year injury so Murray should be healthy for the 2026 season.
Arizona Cardinals remaining schedule","Year 3 under Jonathan Gannon hasn't gone as planned for the Arizona Cardinals.

In 2024, the team went 8-9 behind an improved defense. Investments on that side of the ball via free agency and the draft had the team poised to make another jump in a competitive NFC West.

Instead, the team sits 3-9 and firmly last in what's been the most competitive division in the league. Injuries have taken a toll on the team – especially on offense. James Conner, the team's leading rusher in each of the last four seasons, suffered a season-ending injury in Week 3. Franchise quarterback Kyler Murray's foot injury in Week 5 kept him out of the starting lineup and eventually caused a move to injured reserve (IR).

Gannon revealed today Murray won't take the field again this season.

“(Murray) had some more tests done this week,” Gannon said. “Went out of state, got another opinion on it. It's not progressing where it's gonna make sense that he can go. So he's gonna be done for the year.”

Week 14 was the earliest he could return from IR. Veteran Jacoby Brissett's started in Murray's place this season and performed well. In seven starts, he's averaging 312.6 passing yards per game – up from Murray's 192.4 in five starts.

Brissett's gone 1-6 as a starter with the lone win coming against the Dallas Cowboys in Week 9. Arizona's lost close battles to Jacksonville and Tampa Bay in Week 12 and Week 13, respectively, despite Brissett's production.

Gannon was asked about Murray's future and if he expects the former No. 1 overall pick to be the team's starting quarterback in 2026.

“I’m worried about the Rams right now,” Gannon said. He did add that he feels bad for Murray in this situation.

""He got hurt and he wasn't healthy enough to play. That's first and foremost. That's where I would leave it right now.""

Arizona hosts Los Angeles this week for the first of their two divisional games against the team. The Cardinals are 0-4 in NFC West play this year with two losses each to the 49ers and Seahawks. They're already eliminated from playoff contention in the NFC ahead of the final five games of their season.

When will Kyler Murray return?

There are no signs this foot injury will be a multi-year injury so Murray should be healthy for the 2026 season. Whether he remains with the Cardinals or ends up elsewhere is yet to be determined.

Murry has three years left on his current contract extension. It'd cost the Cardinals $54.718 million in dead cap space to release him this upcoming offseason, per OverTheCap. That number balloons to $80 million if the team waits until 2027 to release him.

A trade seems more likely if the team decides to move on from him but that could get tricky with his contract as well. A potential team would likely negotiate a certain amount of the contract to be split between them and the Cardinals for Arizona to move off from their starting quarterback.

Odunze started appearing on Chicago's injury report before Halloween with what was initially classified as a heel injury. The wide receiver said the injury was ""not a simple fix"" but one he would be monitoring along with the Bears' training staff. The team managed Odunze's injury throughout November by having him sit out at least one practice each week last month, though he did not show up on the injury report last week ahead of the Eagles game.

Odunze was targeted six times and had two catches for eight yards in Chicago's 24-15 win over the Philadelphia Eagles. He showed no signs of injury during the game and played 80% of offensive snaps.

Earlier this week, coach Ben Johnson lamented that the Bears are winning ""in spite of our passing game, not because of it,"" and will look to get on track without the team's leading receiver. Odunze's absence could mean more targets for rookie Luther Burden III or Olamide Zaccheaus. DJ Moore, Colston Loveland and Cole Kmet could also see a production spike with Odunze sidelined.

Cornerback Tyrique Stevenson (hip) and linebacker Ruben Hyppolite II (shoulder) were also ruled out against the Packers.

But they might’ve lost one of their key defenders in the process.

Pro Bowl safety Brian Branch is feared to have suffered an Achilles injury, a league source told The Athletic’s Dianna Russini.

Branch exited the game in the fourth quarter, walking gingerly off the field with the assistance of athletic trainers. When he returned to the sideline, a cart was brought out to escort him to the locker room. He was spotted with crutches and a walking boot after the game. The Lions are still learning more about the severity of Branch’s injury.

“I don’t know,” Lions head coach Dan Campbell said postgame, when asked about Branch’s status. “I’ll know more tomorrow.”

Losing Branch would be a major blow to a secondary that’s already shorthanded. A 2023 second-round pick out of Alabama, Branch is one of the most versatile DBs in the league — capable of providing sticky coverage against receivers and tight ends alike. He’s instinctive, physical and fearless. His ability to play in the box or back deep allows defensive coordinator Kelvin Sheppard to get creative elsewhere. He’s also been a mainstay in an ever-changing secondary.

All-Pro safety Kerby Joseph (knee) has missed the last seven games. If he returns to action this year, he won’t be 100 percent. Cornerback D.J. Reed missed six games this season recovering from a hamstring injury, while fellow corner Terrion Arnold has missed five with varying injuries. Arnold will miss the rest of the season after opting for season-ending shoulder surgery.

If Branch is added to that list, the Lions will need to rely on the likes of Thomas Harper, Avonte Maddox and Daniel Thomas at safety. The Lions have four games remaining, and likely need to win three to give themselves a shot at the playoffs. That will be harder without Branch. Not to mention the timing of this injury, depending on its severity, could keep him out for part of the 2026 season, in what could be a contract year for Branch.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/05095431/USATSI_27743388-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-06 11:05:37.807620

Phillips, 26, began the week listed as limited with that concussion so it’s a good sign that he got through that first day of practice. He was limited again on Friday but appears on track to play against the Chargers on Monday night.

Having Phillips for this game is big because the Chargers have given up a ton of pressure this season after losing both of their starting tackles. Not only that but Justin Herbert is expected to play this game after having surgery on his non-throwing hand earlier this week. Herbert has been pressured more than any other quarterback in the NFL this season.

Eagles left guard Landon Dickerson was not at practice because he got a rest day. His absence was not injury-related. Brett Toth filled in at left guard.

Here's the full injury report from Friday:

Did not practice: DT Jalen Carter (shoulders), G Landon Dickerson (rest), T Lane Johnson (foot)

Limited: LB Zack Baun (hand), WR Jahan Dotson (toe), OLB Jaelan Phillips (concussion)

NFL

Full: S Marcus Epps (shoulder), WR Xavier Gipson (shoulder), T Myles Hinton (back)

DT Jalen Carter (shoulders) and RT Lane Johnson (foot) both missed practice again on Friday. Carter has already been ruled out this week after having a procedure Monday on both of his shoulders. Carter is considered week-to-week. Johnson suffered a Lisfranc sprain against the Lions and has missed the last two games. Fred Johnson is expected to make his third straight start.

In addition to Phillips, the other three Eagles who began the week listed as limited — LB Zack Baun (hand), WR Jahan Dotson (toe), WR Xavier Gipson (shoulder) — were practicing again on Friday. Gipson missed last week with that injury he suffered against the Cowboys but was upgraded to a full participant on Friday. Britain Covey was promoted to the 53-man roster to return punts in his place.

Both players who were full to start the week — S Marcus Epps (shoulder), T Myles Hinton (back) — were back on the field Friday. Both Epps and Hinton have been on IR and are practicing after the team opened their respective practice windows.

If Epps looks good during this week of practice, there’s a good chance he’ll be a starting safety next to Reed Blankenship on Monday night. Sydney Brown got a start last week in place of rookie Drew Mukuba, who is on IR with an ankle fracture, and had some ups and downs. There’s a chance Epps could stabilize the position.",https://media.nbcsportsphiladelphia.com/2025/12/Phillips-J-USATSI-27622884.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-06 03:59:28.373792

Among the players referenced were defensive back Javon Bullard, cornerback Nate Hobbs, receiver Jayden Reed, receiver Matthew Golden and receiver Savion Williams.
-- On Nate Hobbs, who has missed four straight games with a knee injury: ""He's looked good, but we'll see where he is.
The Packers could use his return this week if Bullard can't go.

Among the players referenced were defensive back Javon Bullard, cornerback Nate Hobbs, receiver Jayden Reed, receiver Matthew Golden and receiver Savion Williams.

The injury updates from LaFleur's Friday press conference:

-- On slot cornerback Javon Bullard, who missed Thursday's practice: ""Just having some lingering effects, so we thought it would be best to shut him down and see how he progresses over the course of the week."" He's been playing through an ankle injury. LaFleur said Bullard would NOT practice on Friday, but he hasn't been ruled out for Sunday. ""It's up in the air.""

-- On Nate Hobbs, who has missed four straight games with a knee injury: ""He's looked good, but we'll see where he is. How he goes out there today and performs. But he's made progress."" The Packers could use his return this week if Bullard can't go. Hobbs has slot experience.

-- On if Jayden Reed will return and play Sunday: ""I hope so, but we're still going through the process of being fully cleared medically."" Reed broke his collarbone in Week 2 and has missed 11 weeks. It's possible he needs one more scan to show the collarbone is healed enough to play in a game. Or the Packers already did the scan and are trying to weigh the risk and reward of him playing if the collarbone isn't 100 percent healed. Reed remains on injured reserve, and the Packers have until Saturday to activate him.

-- On Matthew Golden, who has missed two straight games with a wrist injury: ""He's done a nice job. He's gone out there, caught some balls in practice. Another guy who will be questionable leading up to game time depending on how he's feeling."" Sounds like the first-round pick will be a game-time decision for Sunday.

-- On Savion Wiliams, who is now missing games with a lingering foot injury: ""Definitely not a setback, it's more or less battling through. What we think is best for the long term."" Expect Williams to be ruled out on Friday's final injury report.","https://packerswire.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/21/SPAC/87398508007-2235795113.jpg?crop=4213,2370,x0,y140&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-06 01:00:10.737981

Trossard has been absent since being subbed off late into the first half of Arsenal’s victory over Bayern Munich on November 26.","Arsenal fear that Cristhian Mosquera could miss up to six weeks after suffering an injury this week.

Manager Mikel Arteta said the defender is set for another medical test on Friday after a “more complicated” injury than that affecting Declan Rice, who was also forced off during the midweek 2-0 victory over Brentford.

Mosquera, 21, went down on 41 minutes during the Brentford win and received treatment from Arsenal’s medical staff, after appearing to land awkwardly on his left foot when jumping for a header. The centre-back walked off unassisted but hobbling slightly and was replaced by Jurrien Timber.

Before his side’s trip to Villa Park on Saturday, Arteta said: “Let’s see (on Rice). We have another training session in the afternoon. Every hour is going to be important. Mosquera (ankle) is the one that is more complicated. We have another test today. (William) Saliba and (Leandro) Trossard are a matter of days.”

Sources briefed on Mosquera’s injury, speaking anonymously as they were not authorised to do so publicly, later told The Athletic they fear the Spaniard could miss up to six weeks with the problem.

Arsenal’s squad has been hit with repeated injuries this season, and with Arteta’s first-choice centre-back pairing (Gabriel and Saliba) sidelined on Wednesday, Timber was the only player on the bench with experience playing at centre-back.

Arteta said ahead of the Brentford match that Saliba had picked up a “little niggle” and that it would be a “matter of days” until he could return. Gabriel, however, is still recovering from a longer-term muscular injury to his right thigh, which The Athletic reported on November 18 could keep him out for up to two months.

Mosquera has impressed when called upon for Arsenal, who have the best defensive record in the Premier League and Champions League. The centre back, who joined from Valencia in a deal worth an initial £13million (€15m) in the summer, has made 16 appearances this season.

Trossard has been absent since being subbed off late into the first half of Arsenal’s victory over Bayern Munich on November 26.

Mikel Merino and Bukayo Saka both scored at the Emirates Stadium to keep Arsenal five points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/05050239/GettyImages-2248697219-scaled-e1764928990994.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-06 01:00:15.774440

It's another week without Trey Hendrickson for the Bengals as the star pass rusher deals with a hip injury that has kept him out of practice all week.

Buffalo will not have Bernard and Bosa on Sunday after the two defenders were unable to practice this week due to various injuries. Meanwhile, the club is holding out hope with Josh Palmer by not ruling him out, despite not practicing all week. As for Brown and Kincaid, they both practiced on a limited basis throughout the week.

The Texans will have running back Woody Marks available this week after he initially missed Wednesday's session due to an ankle injury. He was a full participant Friday and has no game designation.

Neither Smith nor Taylor practiced this week, leaving their status for Sunday night very much in doubt. Kansas City already placed left tackle Josh Simmons on injured reserve due to a wrist injury, so this offensive line could be shorthanded.

After further tests ""out of state,"" the decision was made that Murray would be shut down.
As for Murray's status as quarterback of the Cardinals in 2026, Gannon declined to address it.
""Kyler puts in a lot of work and is a valuable piece to this team and this organization,"" Wilson said.
""That's the job,"" Gannon said about the injuries.","Kyler Murray's season is over.

Cardinals coach Jonathan Gannon said Friday the quarterback, who has been on Injured Reserve after suffering a foot injury in Week 5, will not play again in 2025 because the foot has not healed. After further tests ""out of state,"" the decision was made that Murray would be shut down.

""He wasn't progressing in a way that we wanted, so we went and got a different opinion, some different people, and (the foot) is just not right,"" Gannon said.

Jacoby Brissett has been the starter since Week 6.

As for Murray's status as quarterback of the Cardinals in 2026, Gannon declined to address it. ""I'm worried about the Rams right now, honestly"" he said.

Murray played in a career-low five games this season, completing 110 of 161 passes for 962 yards, 6 touchdowns and 3 interceptions for a passer rating of 88.6. He rushed for 173 yards on 29 carries with 1 touchdown.

Murray has not spoken to the media since postgame against the Titans Week 5. He missed three games before being placed on IR, and there had been hope in those three weeks he might return. He posted on social media on Thursday a picture of himself, James Conner, Marvin Harrison Jr. and Michael Wilson during an offseason workout with the title ""Weird Year"" and added a caption that said, ""Never again.""

""Kyler puts in a lot of work and is a valuable piece to this team and this organization,"" Wilson said. ""Him not being to able to be back in the saddle is a tough blow because I know for him and for us, we had a lot of expectations and high hopes and conversations prior to this year about what we could accomplish as a team.

""They paid him as a franchise guy and he's shown he can be that guy, and so I do feel deeply for him.""

The Cardinals will also be without Harrison against the Rams Sunday. Harrison suffered a heel injury last week. Gannon added that he wasn't sure if running back Trey Benson, who is on IR with a knee injury, is going to be able to return this year.

Wide receiver Greg Dortch (chest) and defensive tackle Walter Nolen III (knee) are among those who are also out Sunday.

""That's the job,"" Gannon said about the injuries. ""I appreciate the staff, because I am the one who tells them, 'Here's who is up, here's who is down, this is what you're going to have.' And there is no negativity, there is no 'poor little old me' ... there is none of that. Because that's the job.

""You have to figure it out. Our job is to have solutions and be a part of the solution, not part of the problem.""",https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/cardinals/oqx8b0u0nkgxsfi6omgm,N,,2025-12-05 21:59:18.916599

Given how late in the season this injury is, Branch is extremely unlikely to return to the field this season.","A loss to NFC North rival Green Bay on Thanksgiving put the Detroit Lions out of playoff seeding. A week later, the Lions bounced back with a crucial win over the Dallas Cowboys.

That win may have come at a cost on defense.

Safety Brian Branch tore his Achilles in Detroit's ""Thursday Night Football"" win over Dallas, per ESPN's Jeremy Fowler. The injury happened in the fourth quarter as Branch was in coverage on Cowboys' tight end Jake Ferguson.

Branch is the latest secondary player to miss time for the Lions. Cornerback Terrion Arnold underwent season-ending shoulder surgery earlier this week and fellow safety Kerby Joseph hasn't played since Week 6 due to a knee injury.

Branch made his first Pro Bowl last season with a career-high four interceptions, one sack, 109 tackles and 16 passes defensed. He hadn't tallied an interception yet through 12 games this year but had a career-best 2.5 sacks in addition to nine passes defensed and a fumble recovery.

With Branch out, the Lions brought veteran Daniel Thomas in to finish out the game at safety. Thomas spent the last five years in Jacksonville before coming to Detroit after roster cuts in August.

The Lions get a 10-day rest before another crucial game for their playoff hopes: a Week 15 road matchup against the NFC-West leading Los Angeles Rams.

When will Brian Branch return?

Given how late in the season this injury is, Branch is extremely unlikely to return to the field this season. He should be back in time for the 2026 season depending on how his surgery and recovery go.

Players have returned less than six months after surgery – running back Cam Akers did so in 2021 for the Rams. But others have taken closer to eight months, such as quarterback Kirk Cousins.

Branch will enter the final year of his rookie contract in 2026. Because he was a second-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, the Lions do not have a fifth-year option to exercise and secure him for one more season.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/12/05/USAT/87623404007-usatsi-27743433.jpg?crop=5823,3276,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-12-05 20:01:23.387893

""He's playing great football right now,"" Macdonald said.
We have to more ways to get him involved in the gameplan, but we've got a lot of great players too, so it's a great problem to have.
He's a great teammate, he's been a great teammate, he's got a great outlook on—you can spend a bunch of time on, how do the carries and the touches—he's just worried about playing great football.
""That's some of the best linebacker play I've ever seen in that game,"" Macdonald said.","1. Love and Reed are ready to return.

With Love and Reed coming back, the Seahawks will be as close to full strength on defense as they have been since early in their season-opener. The Seahawks will have to make moves to get both players back on the 53-man roster by Saturday afternoon, but they currently have two openings on the roster to fit those two if that is indeed the plan.

""J-Reed should be good to go, which is exciting,"" Macdonald said. ""Julian is planning on playing, and we're going to play it accordingly. We have a plan, we'll see how the game goes, but excited to have those guys back.""

Asked if Love, who is coming back from a hamstring injury that has limited him to three games this season, will be on a pitch count, so to speak, Macdonald said, ""We have a plan. We're going to stick to our plan.""

With Reed, Macdonald said the veteran defensive tackle will ""just be in the rotation.""

While both players have dealt with setbacks to their injuries that kept them out longer than hoped, Reed and Love have been a positive presence around the team during while unable to play.

""Both are different circumstances, and both were unfortunate, so to be able to handle those things and stay optimistic and stay positive with the guys and keep the focus on the team is pretty awesome,"" Macdonald said. ""We love them for it. You hate that they have to go through those type of things, but the team, we're better because of how they handled the whole situation. We're really appreciative for what they've done.""

2. Other injury news.

While the Seahawks have no players on the active roster with game status designations, rookie defensive end Rylie Mills and receiver Dareke Young have both been ruled out. Mills, who tore his ACL late in his senior season at Notre Dame, returned to practice from the non-football injury list last week, and is making good progress but not yet ready for game action. Mills can practice for up to 21 days from his November 26 return date before the Seahawks have to decide whether or not to add him to the roster.

""Rylie's doing a great job,"" Macdonald said. ""He's working hard. He's so strong. It's just a matter of, how many of how many great reps can we bank before it's time to come back. But he's doing a great job. I'm excited for him.""

Veteran safety Quandre Diggs, who signed to the practice squad last week, was elevated for last week's game to provide safety depth, but may not be available this weekend due to a thigh injury, Macdonald said.

Diggs is not on the injury report because teams do not list practice squad players on the report, but Macdonald said, ""Quandre's working through his thigh right now. It's going to be probably week to week.""

4. Devon Witherspoon is ""the sparkplug behind the whole thing.""

The Seahawks' captains for Week 14 are cornerback Devon Witherspoon, running back Kenneth Walker III and linebacker Patrick O'Connell, and when asked about Witherspoon and Walker, Macdonald had plenty of nice things to say about both.

On Witherspoon, Macdonald said, ""He's part of the engine that makes the whole thing go. He's probably the sparkplug behind the whole thing. He could be a captain every week.""

Much like last season, Witherspoon is playing at a very high level without always having the flashy numbers to support it, but Macdonald said that has more to do with the way he's calling games than anything Witherspoon is doing.

""He's playing great football right now,"" Macdonald said. ""Great football. He's playing three positions, and he is really the energy behind our defense on a daily basis. He's playing high-level cornerback play, and you can put the lack of production on me. We have to more ways to get him involved in the gameplan, but we've got a lot of great players too, so it's a great problem to have. But it's nothing that he's doing. He's playing really, really high-level football right now for us that's really helping us.""

On Walker, Macdonald said. ""I think he's playing his best football right now. And he's had such a great attitude throughout the whole process. He's a great teammate, he's been a great teammate, he's got a great outlook on—you can spend a bunch of time on, how do the carries and the touches—he's just worried about playing great football. He's excited about where we're going and you can see his personality shine through, so I'm happy for Ken.""

5. Ernest Jones IV impressed Macdonald with his play last week.

Higgins has been out since he suffered a concussion in the team's Week 12 loss against New England on Nov. 23. After clearing that hurdle Friday, Higgins is eager to suit up again -- especially with Ja'Marr Chase and quarterback Joe Burrow.

""It's been a minute, man,"" Higgins said. ""I'm definitely looking forward to it. It's going to be great.""

Higgins acknowledged how scary the injury has been. Against the Patriots, Higgins went up for a deep pass down the right sideline. Higgins' head smacked against the turf at Paycor Stadium as he was unable to make the catch. He was on the turf for several minutes before being carted back into the locker room.

""Any head injury is scary for anybody,"" Higgins said. ""Thank God I'm able to play again this weekend and keep playing for the rest of the season.""

The sixth-year player out of Clemson ramped up his progression over the course of the week. He was a limited participant Wednesday before having a full slate of practice reps Thursday. Higgins detailed the protocol process as he worked his way back.

""It was just getting through concussion protocol, seeing how I'm feeling with working out, running routes and things like that,"" Higgins said. ""So it's basically all just on me, see how I'm feeling and then passing those tests as well.""

After Friday's practice at the team's indoor bubble, Higgins said he felt great.

He'll give the Bengals (4-8) a boost ahead of Sunday's critical showdown against Buffalo (8-4). Cincinnati is currently two games back of the Pittsburgh Steelers for the division lead and will likely need to win out to have a shot of clinching the AFC North title and the automatic playoff berth.

Sunday will mark the first time Higgins, Chase and Burrow will be on the field at the same since Week 2, when Burrow suffered a turf toe injury that sidelined him for nine games. In Burrow's first contest back, the Bengals beat the Baltimore Ravens to end a four-game losing streak and keep their playoff hopes mathematically afloat.

The Bengals have made a significant long-term investment into that trio. In March, Chase and Higgins inked long-term deals with the club. Chase signed a four-year deal worth $161 million, which is the NFL record for a wide receiver. Higgins earned a three-year deal worth $115 million.

The research team set out to answer a simple but important question: Do career length or playing position predict long-term health in former NFL athletes? Their findings show they do not. Although these measures are often used as stand-ins for head injury exposure, they didn’t help identify which players experienced worse mental or physical health later in life. The study suggests that future research and potentially future health guidelines in sports should rely on confirmed concussion history rather than assumptions based on position or years in the league.

""I just feel bad for the quarterback,"" Gannon said. ""He got hurt, and he wasn't healthy enough to play. So I mean, that's first and foremost. That's where I would leave it right now.""

Murray's future with the Cardinals has been a topic of speculation this season. Asked if he thinks Murray will be the Cardinals' quarterback next season, Gannon didn't have an answer.

The Cardinals quarterback will not play again this season, coach Jonathan Gannon announced Friday, due to a foot injury that landed him on injured reserve in early November.

""He had more tests done this week, went out of state, got another opinion on it,"" Gannon explained. ""It's not progressing where it's gonna back sense that he can go. So he's gonna be done for the year.""

Murray first suffered the foot injury in Arizona's Week 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans and was treated as a week-to-week matter, but as he failed to show signs of improvement in his recovery, the ailment became an on-ramp to a larger discussion regarding the Cardinals' quarterback situation.

Initially, Murray's injury-related absence felt like a bit of a soft benching. With Murray behind center, Arizona's offense struggled consistently in 2025 and was frequently behind schedule, leading to low offensive outputs that betrayed the efforts of Gannon's improved defense and led to three straight one-possession losses in Weeks 3-5. Arizona demonstrated notable offensive improvement with veteran backup Jacoby Brissett playing in place of Murray, driving calls for Brissett to replace Murray going forward.

Although the Cardinals lost two more games by a single possession with Brissett at the controls, the veteran delivered an impressive showing in a prime-time win in Dallas in Week 9, convincing onlookers that Arizona had a better chance of victory with Brissett than Murray. Murray's eventual placement on injured reserve merely solved this conundrum while also inviting a new collection of questions regarding his future with the team.

While disappointing for the former No. 1 overall pick, Friday's news doesn't change matters for the 3-9 Cardinals in 2025. Instead, it merely guarantees Murray won't have a chance to produce an on-field counterargument to the claim his time in Arizona is dwindling.

When asked if Gannon expected Murray to be the Cardinals' starting quarterback in 2026, Gannon deflected.

""I'm worried about the Rams right now, honestly,"" he said, speaking of Arizona's upcoming opponent in a game that previously represented Murray's first opportunity to return from IR.

There's plenty of reason to believe the Cardinals might move on from Murray in the spring. Arizona can't quite financially justify outright releasing Murray in 2026 because it would result in a $57.7 million dead cap hit that can be split between 2026 and 2027, a significant sum for a team that would also be in the market for a replacement at the position. If the Cardinals can find a trade partner, however, they'd carry just $17.9 million in dead cap, saving $35.3 million and making a divorce much more palatable.

In order to orchestrate a trade, the Cardinals would have to earn his approval while also negotiating a competitive deal that would convince another team to agree to a trade. For now, such an effort isn't the top priority, but it won't be long before a new Super Bowl champion is crowned and the Cardinals will need to get to work.

One thing is certain, though: Murray has played his last down in 2025. We'll see if his next is in a new uniform.",https://static.www.nfl.com/image/upload/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/league/mthv3c8lllichhdlygkw,N,,2025-12-05 16:05:56.635947

It's been a season filled with injuries for the Commanders. How bad has it been? According to Nicki Jhabvala of the Washington Post, should Daniels play Sunday, it would mark the first time all season that they will have their starting quarterback, top three wide receivers and full offensive line on the field together.

[NFL injury updates live]

Things aren't so rosy in Tampa Bay, where the NFC South leaders will go another week without both Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan. The wide receivers were designated to return from injured reserve on Wednesday with their 21-day practice windows opening, but head coach Todd Bowles said they're not ready for this week's matchup with the New Orleans Saints.

Evans has been out since breaking his clavicle on Oct. 22. His extended absence will mean his streak of never having a season of under 1,000 receiving yards will come to an end after 11 seasons.

McMillan has not played all season after suffering a neck injury during preseason.

Other notable Week 14 injuries:

Colts cornerback Sauce Gardner has been ruled out for Week 14 with a calf injury. Gardner was seen on crutches and a walking boot after Indianapolis' loss to the Texans last Sunday, but the injury reportedly isn't as severe as feared, though he won't play against the Jaguars.

Despite needing surgery earlier this week to repair a fractured left hand, Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert is preparing to play Monday night against the Philadelphia Eagles. Herbert was limited Thursday in practice and told reporters afterward that doctors inserted a plate and screws into his hand to stabilize it. He also said he will likely wear a hard cast should he play.

The Minnesota Vikings expect to have J.J. McCarthy for Sunday's game against the Commanders after the quarterback cleared concussion protocol on Thursday. McCarthy was injured in Week 12's defeat to the Green Bay Packers and was ruled out for last week's loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Rookie Max Brosmer took his place last week and threw for 126 yards and four interceptions.

Like McCarthy, Tee Higgins sat out last week's game due to a concussion. The Cincinnati Bengals receiver was a full participant in practice on Thursday and was cleared from concussion protocol on Friday.

After appendicitis knocked him out a few weeks back, now Arizona Cardinals receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. is dealing with a heel issue that will rule him out for Week 14. Harrison sat out practice on Wednesday and Thursday due to the injury that came up during last week's game against the Buccaneers.

1 pick of the 2019 NFL Draft, Murray was drafted to help take the Cardinals deep into the postseason.","Arizona Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray will not return this season due to a lingering foot injury, coach Jonathan Gannon told reporters Friday.

Murray injured his foot late in Arizona’s Oct. 5 loss to the Tennessee Titans. He has not played since then, and backup Jacoby Brissett has led the Cardinals’ offense. Murray was eligible this week to come off injured reserve but the Cardinals did not open his practice window.

“He had some more tests done this week, went out of state, got another opinion on it,” Gannon said Friday. “It’s not progressing to where it’s going to make sense that he can go. So he’s going to be done for the year.”

The decision ends perhaps the most disappointing season of Murray’s seven NFL seasons. In just five games, he completed 68.3 percent of his attempts for 962 yards and six touchdowns with three interceptions. The Week 5 home loss to the Titans in which he was injured ranks among the worst in franchise history.

It’s possible Murray has played his last game in Arizona. In his absence, the journeyman Brissett has ignited the Cardinals’ passing game, putting up better numbers and getting more playmakers involved. Wins, however, have not followed. The Cardinals (3-9) are 1-6 with Brissett and have lost four in a row entering Sunday’s home game against the Los Angeles Rams.

Asked if he expected Murray to return next season, Gannon said he is “just worried about the Rams right now.”

Murray’s future has been debated locally and nationally for months, and it will likely remain a topic of discussion into the offseason. The No. 1 pick of the 2019 NFL Draft, Murray was drafted to help take the Cardinals deep into the postseason. Instead, Murray has gone 38-48-1 as a starter. He lost his only playoff game, a 2021 blowout loss to the Rams.

Murray, 28, remains under contract through 2028 but the final year is a team option. He is owed $36.8 million next season. If he is on Arizona’s roster on March 22, his $19.5 million salary for 2027 will become fully guaranteed.",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/12/05124914/GettyImages-2242064723-scaled.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-05 16:06:00.448096

It will be Daniels' first action since he dislocated his left (non-throwing) elbow in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks.

Daniels returned to practice in a limited fashion last week but was not a full participant until Thursday. He followed that up by fully participating in Friday's session. From there, he was cleared to play for Sunday, Quinn said. Quinn said Daniels had a ""great week"" of practice to get ready.

Daniels, 24, has played in just six of the Commanders' 13 games this season. He suffered a knee sprain against the Green Bay Packers in Week 2 and missed two games, and in Week 7, he suffered a hamstring injury against the Dallas Cowboys. He missed one game due to that injury before returning against Seattle, when he suffered his latest setback.

After Daniels, the Offensive Rookie of the Year, led Washington to a 12-5 record and the franchise's first NFC Championship Game since the 1991 season last year, this season has been a difficult one for both him and the team as a whole. Washington is just 3-9 this season, with Marcus Mariota starting in the six games Daniels has missed. Washington has dealt with several injuries on both sides of the ball, and the defense has plummeted to among the NFL's worst.

Even with the team all but eliminated from playoff contention, Quinn said last week he thought Daniels could use the reps.

""I think it's important as Jayden's ... learning to play this position at the highest level competitively, also doing it safely, and those are reps, you know, that you develop as well,"" Quinn said Nov. 24.

The third-year standout limped off in the fourth quarter and reportedly left the stadium on crutches and in a walking boot.

Branch appeared to suffer an injury in the first half but continued to play until he went down following a red-zone stop late in the game. Medical staff helped him to the sideline before he was carted to the locker room. Coach Dan Campbell offered no specifics postgame.

The extent of the injury marks a major loss for Detroit, which has leaned heavily on Branch amid mounting injuries in the secondary. The 24-year-old started all 12 games he played this season, posting 75 tackles, 2.5 sacks, nine passes defensed, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Branch was a Pro Bowl selection in 2024 and has established himself as one of Detroit's most versatile defenders since being drafted in the second round in 2023.

The Lions (8-5) currently sit just outside the playoff field but remain firmly in the hunt for a third consecutive postseason berth. They now face a critical stretch without a defensive centerpiece, though they have a 10-day window before their next game against the Los Angeles Rams.

What Branch's injury means for Detroit's playoff push

Branch's expected absence exacerbates an already depleted depth chart. Starting safety Kerby Joseph has been sidelined since Oct. 12 with a knee injury, and cornerback Terrion Arnold was lost for the year after undergoing shoulder surgery. Against Dallas, Detroit briefly dropped to its fourth- and fifth-string safeties when Thomas Harper exited early with a concussion, leaving Avonte Maddox and Daniel Thomas to finish the game.

Without Branch and others, it could force Detroit to reconfigure both its personnel and identity on the back end. He has been central to the Lions' hybrid coverages, frequently aligning in the slot, deep safety and the box. Without him, Detroit loses its most reliable tackler in space and a key pressure option in coordinator Aaron Glenn's scheme.

The Lions will likely lean on Maddox, Thomas and practice squad elevations to fill the gaps until Joseph's status changes. But the ripple effects extend further: cornerbacks may face more man coverage without Branch's ability to disguise rotations and Detroit's pass rush may need to generate quicker pressure to compensate for reduced flexibility behind it.

Dallas Cowboys @ Detroit Lions

Amon-Ra St. Brown starts despite injury: St. Brown ended up not missing a game due to his ankle injury.

St. Brown played four snaps on Thanksgiving before he suffered an ankle injury, causing him to miss the rest of the game. While the injury wasn’t deemed season-ending, he still appeared likely to miss one or two games. He didn’t practice all week but was able to go through pre-game warmups without issues and was ultimately active. The NFL Network's Ian Rapoport mentioned in the pregame show that he might not see his usual number of snaps.

The Lions targeted St. Brown on their first play of the game, and he left the field after that play. He returned for the Lions' third play and ended up playing every other offensive play for the rest of the first half.

Detroit didn’t have Kalif Raymond, who missed his second-straight game due to an ankle injury. This meant Isaac TeSlaa was the third wide receiver. Half of his receptions have been touchdowns, and that continued this week with two receptions and one touchdown. Tom Kennedy, who made his first catch in three seasons last week in St. Brown's place, was the fourth wide receiver and took a few snaps from TeSlaa during the game.

Anyone hesitant to put St. Brown back in fantasy lineups this week should have no hesitation next week, considering how much St. Brown played in this game, and the extended time off Detroit has before their next game.

The Lions make a change at tight end: Anthony Firkser started his first game since 2022, while Brock Wright was placed on injured reserve.

Sam LaPorta is on injured reserve and is unlikely to return this season. Brock Wright missed last week due to a neck injury, and Detroit opted to put him on injured reserve before this game, which will keep him out for the rest of the fantasy season.

Since Wright’s injury, Ross Dwelley had been the Lions’ primary tight end. Firkser was signed to the practice squad after LaPorta’s injury less than a month ago, and he was signed to the active roster before the Thanksgiving game with Wright out. Firkser has a history as a receiving tight end, while Dwelley has traditionally been a blocker, so it made sense that Firkser would play more in a game where Detroit focused on passing. He caught a seven-yard pass while Dwelley caught a four-yard pass.

While Firkser was the starting tight end this week, his time as the starter might be short-lived. Shane Zylstra returned to practice from injured reserve on Monday. He was limited in his first practice due to a knee injury and didn’t practice the rest of the week, but he could be the Lions' starter when he returns. He’s been with the team since 2021 and notably had three touchdowns in a game in 2022.

It’s unlikely that any Lions tight end has any value for fantasy managers over the next three weeks, but on the off-chance one does, it would most likely be Zylstra.

Monitor CeeDee Lamb’s health: Lamb suffered a concussion in the third quarter and was quickly ruled out.

Lamb has put together a very successful season, catching at least four passes for 65 yards in every game, outside of Week 3, where he only played seven snaps due to injury. He had four 110-plus-yard games before this week, including on Thanksgiving. He had reached 121 yards in this game by the Cowboys' second offensive play of the second half. He suffered the concussion two plays later on an end-zone target while trying to make a catch. There were only a few minutes between Lamb going to the medical tent and getting ruled out.

George Pickens has been the other top Cowboys wide receiver, but he had a relatively quiet night with five receptions for 37 yards. Prior to Lamb’s injury, Ryan Flournoy was playing a little more than usual, and Kavontae Turpin a little less. The Lions play man coverage at a higher rate than any other defense, and Flournoy plays better against man coverage, while Turpin plays better against zone, which could have influenced this decision. After Lamb’s injury, Flournoy and Turpin were more consistently on the field. Dallas was playing behind, so the team stuck with 11 personnel. Flournoy made the most of his opportunities, catching nine passes for 115 yards and a touchdown.

The Cowboys have 10 days until their next game, giving Lamb more time to clear the concussion protocol than most players after one week. This was Lamb’s second recorded concussion, and the first came in 2021. The Cowboys face the Minnesota Vikings next week, and they have allowed the fewest fantasy points to wide receivers. Outside of leagues with 16 or more players, it’s best to leave players like Flournoy and Turpin on the waiver wire, given the matchup.

Miscellaneous Notes

Cowboys halfback Jaydon Blue was a healthy inactive, his fifth straight absence.

Dallas wide receiver George Pickens was limited in practice on Monday due to calf and knee injuries.

Cowboys wide receiver Jonathan Mingo was active this week after being a healthy inactive last week. He takes the spot of Jalen Tolbert, who was a healthy inactive. Dallas has swapped between the two in each of their last four games.

Cowboys tight end Jake Ferguson played over 80% of Dallas' offensive snaps for the second time this season. His snap rate tends to increase when Dallas is playing from behind.

Dallas kicker Brandon Aubrey made field goals of 29, 42, 55, 57 and 63 yards, giving fantasy managers who drafted him a significant advantage this week, particularly in leagues with bonuses for longer field goals.

Lions running back David Montgomery was held under 40% of offensive snaps for the fourth straight game. He averaged 41.1% of Detroit's offensive snaps over the first 10 weeks.

Jahmyr Gibbs scored three touchdowns in this game. It was his third game with three touchdowns in the last five weeks.

Detroit running back Sione Vaki was limited in practice all week due to a thumb injury and was questionable but played.

The Lions activated wide receiver Malik Cunningham from the practice squad for this game on Thursday. This was potentially a precaution in case St. Brown couldn’t play very much. The former Baltimore Ravens quarterback/wide receiver signed with Detroit before it played Baltimore but had stuck around the practice squad since that point. He played his first NFL snap since 2023 and received his first NFL carry.

The Lions claimed tight end Hayden Rucci off waivers from the Miami Dolphins earlier in the week, but he was a healthy inactive.

The wide receivers were designated to return from injured reserve on Wednesday with their 21-day practice windows opening.

But that doesn't mean they'll see action this week against the New Orleans Saints. There's still work to be done and, at least in Evans' case, he'll likely have a slow roll out when he is back in action.

""Yeah, I think so,"" said Bucs offensive coordinator Josh Grizzard about a potential pitch count for Evans. ""I think the same plan we had with Chris [Godwin] and really the same thought with Buck [Irving] as well, where when these guys are back to be able to expect them to play a full game like they normally would, wouldn't be fair to him.

""But be able to bring him along and to allow his play strength to build up. Not that Mike needs confidence, but it's more of the stamina and his strength.""

Evans has been out since breaking his clavicle on Oct. 22. His extended absence will mean his streak of never having a season of under 1,000 receiving yards will come to an end after 11 seasons.

[NFL injury updates live]

McMillan has not played all season after suffering a neck injury during preseason.

Week 14 could see the possible return of Jayden Daniels under center for the Washington Commanders. The second-year quarterback was a full practice participant on Thursday, the first time he's done so since dislocating his elbow in Week 9.

Daniels returned to practice last week, but he was limited and ultimately ruled out for a ""Sunday Night Football"" showdown with the Denver Broncos.

Head coach Dan Quinn has yet to say whether Daniels will return this weekend or Marcus Mariota will get another start.

It's been a season filled with injuries for the Commanders. How bad has it been? According to Nicki Jhabvala of the Washington Post, should Daniels play Sunday it would mark the first time all season that they will have their starting quarterback, top three wide receivers and full offensive line on the field together.

Other notable Week 14 injuries:

Despite needing surgery earlier this week to repair a fractured left hand, Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert is preparing to play Monday night against the Philadelphia Eagles. Herbert was limited Thursday in practice and told reporters afterward that doctors inserted a plate and screws into his hand to stabilize it. He also said he will likely wear a hard cast should he play.

The Minnesota Vikings expect to have J.J. McCarthy for Sunday's game against the Commanders after the quarterback cleared concussion protocol on Thursday. McCarthy was injured in Week 12's defeat to the Green Bay Packers and was ruled out for last week's loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Rookie Max Brosmer took his place last week and threw for 126 yards and four interceptions.

Like McCarthy, Tee Higgins sat out last week's game due to a concussion. The Cincinnati Bengals receiver was a full participant, however, in Thursday's practice, a signal he could be back Sunday against the Buffalo Bills.

After appendicitis knocked him out a few weeks back, now Arizona Cardinals receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. is dealing with a heel issue that is threatening his Week 14 status. Harrison sat out practice on Wednesday and Thursday due to the issue that came up during last week's game against the Buccaneers. Head coach Jonathan Gannon said Harrison was going to see a doctor about the injury and that he is considered ""day-to-day.""

Carter’s recovery is considered week-to-week, with the goal of having the defensive lineman fully healthy by the playoffs.

Defensive coordinator Vic Fangio confirmed Tuesday that Carter had been playing through shoulder ailments.

Carter was self-critical of his play in last week’s loss to the Chicago Bears, in which D’Andre Swift and Kyle Monangai helped combine for the most rushing yards against the Eagles since 2015 (281).

“There was some runs out there where I got drove back where I wasn’t making no effect on the play,” Carter said afterward.

Carter, a 2024 Pro Bowl player, is the fulcrum of Philadelphia’s defensive front. His absence is significant. The Eagles’ defensive EPA per play changes drastically when Carter is on the field (0.12) and off the field (-0.14), per TruMedia.

The Eagles use their interior linemen as leverage to generate backfield pressure. Carter’s one-game suspension in Week 1 against the Dallas Cowboys contributed to their defensive struggles in that game (the Cowboys averaged 5.4 yards per rush).

Byron Young, a three-year veteran, is in a position to backfill Carter’s snaps. Ty Robinson, a fourth-round rookie, could also contribute.

Who will be asked to fill the void?

The spotlight on the Eagles’ interior defensive line will be on Moro Ojomo and Jordan Davis, who are the top players with Carter sidelined.

Ojomo has been one of the Eagles’ most productive pass rushers this season and is tied for the team lead with four sacks. Davis is known mainly for his run-stopping, but he’s also raised his performance against the pass rush.

Although Byron Young and rookie Ty Robinson will take on bigger roles, the key for the Eagles will be Ojomo and Davis. Ojomo already plays 65 percent of the defensive snaps; Davis plays 62 percent of the defensive snaps.

Don’t be surprised to see the Eagles bounce Brandon Graham inside on passing downs. It hasn’t been a staple of Fangio’s defenses because of the depth at defensive tackle, but they’ve tinkered with it in recent weeks, and it would make sense given the presence of Jaelan Phillips, Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt. Graham has had success in his career as an interior rusher.

“We could play him in there more,” Fangio said two weeks ago after he was used in that role against Dallas. “He can rush pretty good from in there. We were playing a lot of plays, and guys needed a break.” — Zach Berman, Eagles senior writer",https://static01.nyt.com/athletic/uploads/wp/2025/11/19002319/USATSI_27425678-scaled-e1763529820750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=cover,N,,2025-12-05 11:09:04.148243
