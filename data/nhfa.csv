Back by popular demand! Urban Movement Arts returns to the Free Library of Philadelphia to offer a series of dance classes. For the Spring, we're having Salsa, Bachata, and Reggaeton classes. Our second class is Beginner Bachata with Laurel!
End your day on a high note with this energizing and joyful Bachata class! We'll begin with a warm-up focusing on foundational techniques and basic steps to get you moving confidently. Then, dive straight into dynamic choreography that blends traditional bachata footwork with sensual movements for a unique and expressive style.
This class is open to all levels, so you'll feel supported and challenged whether you're a seasoned dancer or just starting out. We'll wrap up with a group performance of the choreography, celebrating your progress and embracing the joy of dance together.
Elevate your spirit, find your rhythm, and set the tone for an amazing upcoming weekend. Join us and let the music move you!
Time: 6:30 p.m. - 7:30 p.m.
Location: Skyline Room, 4th Floor, Parkway Central Library
Recommendations: Wear loose-fitting/comfy clothes, sneakers, and bring your own water (and a towel if you think you'll need one). We do not have a changing room, and the closest water fountain is on the first floor.
