,,2025-06-06 23:15:05+00:00,Black Promoters Collective (BPC),Bresh Begins Historic Latin Music Residency at Amnesia Ibiza: ‘It’s a Huge Responsibility to Carry the Flag’ - Black Promoters Collective (BPC),,,,,,https://blackpromoterscollective.com/bresh-begins-historic-latin-music-residency-at-amnesia-ibiza-its-a-huge-responsibility-to-carry-the-flag/,"Bresh, the “Most Beautiful Party in the World,” is embarking on its most ambitious chapter yet in Ibiza. This weekend, the widely celebrated fiesta kicks off its first Saturday-night residency at Amnesia — the storied venue dubbed the “temple of electronic music.” Running all summer through Sept. 20, this monumental residency sets the stage for Bresh to possibly redefine Ibiza’s nocturnal landscape with its known Latin pulse. “For us, it’s a source of pride because Ibiza is one of the biggest entertainment platforms in the world —right up there with Las Vegas,” Nicolás Fernández, Bresh’s chief strategy officer, tells Billboard Español. Bresh’s residency at Amnesia isn’t just a milestone for the party itself but also a major turning point for the Spanish island, which has historically been synonymous with electronic music.       Trending on Billboard          This season marks Bresh’s third residency at Amnesia, after previously hosting parties on Tuesdays and then Thursdays. But now, it moves to Saturdays — the most coveted night of the week. “We’re doing something different, something unique — really offering a true alternative to electronic music,” Fernández adds. “[Ibiza] is one of our biggest bets every year. It’s where we bring our ideas to life: the staging, the decorations, the show, the music. It’s one of our main laboratories, where we need to shine the most.”     Since its inception in 2016 in Buenos Aires, Bresh has become a global phenomenon, delivering an unapologetically joyful mix of reggaetón, pop, rock en español, and more Latin rhythms. The residency is designed for an audience of both locals and international visitors eager to dance and connect during its 16-week season.   “You’ve got a big Spanish audience on the island that might be more familiar with Latin music and culture, but you also have Italian, British, German, and Dutch audiences who might not be as familiar,” he says. “It’s both a joy and a huge responsibility to carry the flag and represent [Latin culture].”                              Bresh       Courtesy of Fiesta Bresh             Since opening its doors in the 1970s, Amnesia has established itself as one of the most prestigious clubs in the world. Its recognition includes accolades at the International Dance Music Awards (IDMAs) as the best global club in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2011.   The residency will showcase its essence with a lineup of surprise guests every week, in a format they call Bresh & Friends, Fernández explains. This year, the production comes with a completely revamped design and execution, taking the Latin party experience to another level — something that hasn’t been seen in Bresh’s previous Ibiza residencies.   “We believe that this year the key difference had to be showcasing what happens in many other places — inviting artists and people from the industry to be part of this and doing it together through Bresh as a platform,” he says. “It’s our role to take up this space, but also to be a place where artists with a Latin and Spanish-speaking imprint can show their work. These are artists who, perhaps, don’t often have shows in Ibiza — it’s not very common. Maybe they fill stadiums or massive venues in other cities, but in Ibiza, that doesn’t happen due to the island’s own dynamics. We feel we have to be the space to make this happen.”     Notable figures from Latin music and culture are no strangers to Bresh’s dance floors in Ibiza and beyond. Previous guests include Aitana, Emilia, Lola Índigo, and even sports icons like Lionel Messi and Brazilian soccer star Vinícius Jr. However, the emphasis is not on celebrity appearances but on the collective energy of the crowd and the music. “The focus at Bresh isn’t on who shows up, but on what’s created through the connections,” reads the press release.   This season in Ibiza brings a new addition to the Bresh universe: Casa Bresh. Designed as a space that goes beyond a traditional backstage, this new location aims to become a creative and social hub for artists, collaborators, and friends. “Casa Bresh is the place where these artists will stay and spend a few days experiencing what Ibiza is all about,” Fernández reveals. “It’s a carefully designed and creative environment, meant for connecting, conversing, and celebrating from a different perspective.”   The magic of Bresh has always been its ability to connect people, and Casa Bresh is no exception. Spontaneous moments at these parties have already led to major collaborations, such as Ozuna and Tiago PZK meeting at a Miami edition of the party and later creating the hit “Nos Comemos” in 2022, which made its way onto several Billboard charts, including Latin Rhythm Airplay at No. 16.   With over one million attendees each year across more than 30 countries, 190 cities, and four continents, Bresh continues to solidify its status as a global phenomenon. But its Ibiza residency carries a special mission. “”From the very first day we arrived, the goal was clear: ‘We need to be here forever.’”     “We believe we’re here to embody everything that aligns directly with Bresh’s values,” Fernández says. “The essence of Bresh is to make people happy, bring joy, dancing, and great energy to everyone.”",,https://blackpromoterscollective.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Bresh-cr-Courtesy-of-Fiesta-02-Bresh-2025-billboard-1548.jpg,,,2025-06-06 22:00:20.822791
