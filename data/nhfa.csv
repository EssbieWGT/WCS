,,2025-07-16 03:16:25+00:00,Black Promoters Collective (BPC),Maluma and Manager Walter Kolm Part Ways After 12-Year Run - Black Promoters Collective (BPC),,,,,,https://blackpromoterscollective.com/maluma-and-manager-walter-kolm-part-ways-after-12-year-run/,"After more than 12 years working together, Colombian superstar Maluma and marquee manager Walter Kolm and his team at WK Entertainment have terminated their managerial relationship.  The split, confirmed exclusively to Billboard and expected to be announced today (July 15) was amicable, and puts an end to one of the most successful and stable artist-manager relationships in Latin music in recent years.   “I can only be thankful for so many special moments together, both inside and out of the industry,” Maluma (real name Juan Luis Londoño) said in a statement. “Looking back to the first minute that we started working together, I wouldn’t change a thing. On the contrary, together we showed that the sky is the limit and we accomplished the unimaginable. Today is the end of a professional cycle, but also the beginning of new opportunities for both of us. Our personal relationship remains intact, and like I always have, I wish only the best for him and his team.”      Trending on Billboard          He added, “Thank you, Walter, for your passion and dedication during these years. I love you, thank you and appreciate you.”   The singer told Billboard that he does not have new management and is “building a new team with new ideas. I want to give myself space and I’m focused on making new music, from my heart.”   Kolm signed Maluma in 2013, when the then-19-year-old was still largely unknown outside Colombia — but he immediately recognized the young artist’s star potential.   “From that very moment I knew he had something special and seeing him become who he is today has been one of the proudest moments of my life,” said Kolm in a statement.    Now, he added,  “After many years of building a shared dream side by side, my time as Maluma’s manager comes to an end. Together we broke records, traversed borders and redefined what it means to be a global Latin artist. From his early days in Medellín to selling out international stages, every step has been an act of love, faith and total dedication. I’m very proud of you, Juancho. You are a superstar and even though our professional relationship ends, our personal one remains intact because I’m a second father to you and will always be here for you.”     Maluma would go on to become one of Latin music’s biggest global stars, grazing the cover of Billboard three times: once with Shakira, another with Jennifer López and another alone. He was the first artist to top Billboard’s Global Excl. U.S. chart when it launched in 2020, with “Hawái” and he became the face of multiple global brands, including Hugo Boss.   Although Maluma and Kolm are no longer artist and manager, the two still have projects together, including an upcoming tour in Mexico that’s slated to kick off in August and includes three dates in Mexico City’s Palacio de los Deportes. Those dates are the follow-up to Maluma’s 12-city European arena tour, which included three sold-out nights at Madrid’s Wizink Center.   Now, says Maluma, he’s focused on releasing new music. “I’m excited about starting a new chapter. I have incredible songs and collaborations,” he told Billboard. A new single, “Bronceado,” is due July 17.  Maluma will also continue to helm his label, Royalty Records, whose roster includes rising star Maisak.   On his end, Kolm this year expanded his roster of artists, signing música mexicana star Xavi and, most recently, Colombian pop/rockers Morat. They join a group of stars that includes Argentine pop star Emilia, Colombian icon Carlos Vives, Puerto Rican legend Wisin and Prince Royce.   Kolm, who was Billboard’s 2018 Latin Executive of the Year, is widely viewed as one of Latin music’s most successful managers. He is also the founder of WK Records, whose roster includes Ryan Castro.",,https://blackpromoterscollective.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Walter-Kolm-and-Maluma-cr-Miguel-Lua-2025-billboard-espanol-1548.jpg,,,2025-07-16 18:07:21.263175
