However, these programmes face scrutiny over potential greenwashing in communication. This study uses a two-step approach to examine the communication practices of 32 airlines across Asia, Europe, and North America. The content analysis assesses accessibility, transparency, and flexibility in communications, focusing on emphasizing not just the content but also how easily travellers can find, understand, and engage with VCO information. The interpretive analysis identifies misleading practices. Findings reveal diverse practices, regional variations, and differing transparency levels. While some airlines provide detailed communication, others use misleading tactics such as vagueness and selective disclosure. Notably, a third of the airlines did not offer VCO programmes, with many shifting towards sustainable aviation fuels. The results underscore the need for standardized regulations for VCO communication to enable travellers to make informed decisions in the evolving landscape of airline environmental responsibility.",,,,,,https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44333-025-00027-7/MediaObjects/44333_2025_27_Fig1_HTML.png,https://www.nature.com/articles/s44333-025-00027-7,2025-03-04 12:00:03.472635,,
